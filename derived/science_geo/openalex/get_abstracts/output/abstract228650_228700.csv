https://openalex.org/W1986265706,"Large-scale association studies hold substantial promise for unraveling the genetic basis of common human diseases. A well-known problem with such studies is the presence of undetected population structure, which can lead to both false positive results and failures to detect genuine associations. Here we examine approximately 15,000 genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms typed in three population groups to assess the consequences of population structure on the coming generation of association studies. The consequences of population structure on association outcomes increase markedly with sample size. For the size of study needed to detect typical genetic effects in common diseases, even the modest levels of population structure within population groups cannot safely be ignored. We also examine one method for correcting for population structure (Genomic Control). Although it often performs well, it may not correct for structure if too few loci are used and may overcorrect in other settings, leading to substantial loss of power. The results of our analysis can guide the design of large-scale association studies."
https://openalex.org/W2009144436,"Population stratification refers to differences in allele frequencies between cases and controls due to systematic differences in ancestry rather than association of genes with disease. It has been proposed that false positive associations due to stratification can be controlled by genotyping a few dozen unlinked genetic markers. To assess stratification empirically, we analyzed data from 11 case-control and case-cohort association studies. We did not detect statistically significant evidence for stratification but did observe that assessments based on a few dozen markers lack power to rule out moderate levels of stratification that could cause false positive associations in studies designed to detect modest genetic risk factors. After increasing the number of markers and samples in a case-cohort study (the design most immune to stratification), we found that stratification was in fact present. Our results suggest that modest amounts of stratification can exist even in well designed studies."

DOX-mediated cardiomyopathy is linked to its ability to induce apoptosis in endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes by activation of p53 protein and reactive oxygen species. We evaluated the potential roles of H2O2 and p53 in DOX-induced apoptosis in normal bovine aortic endothelial cells and adult rat cardiomyocytes and in tumor cell lines PA-1 (human ovarian teratocarcinoma) and MCF-7 (human breast adenocarcinoma). Time course measurements indicated that activation of caspase-3 preceded the stimulation of p53 transcriptional activity in endothelial cells. In contrast, DOX caused early activation of p53 in tumor cells that was followed by caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation. These findings suggest that the transcriptional activation of p53 in DOX-induced apoptosis in endothelial cells may not be as crucial as it is in tumor cells. Further evidence was obtained using a p53 inhibitor, pifithrin-α. Pifithrin-α completely suppressed DOX-induced activation of p53 in both normal and tumor cell lines and prevented apoptosis in tumor cell lines but not in endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes. In contrast, detoxification of H2O2, either by redox-active metalloporphyrin or overexpression of glutathione peroxidase, decreased DOX-induced apoptosis in endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes but not in tumor cells. This newly discovered mechanistic difference in DOX-induced apoptotic cell death in normal versus tumor cells will be useful in developing drugs that selectively mitigate the toxic side effects of DOX without affecting its antitumor action.

A major adverse side effect associated with DOX usage in the clinic is the onset of cardiomyopathy and heart failure (2Buzdar A.U. Marcus C. Smith T.L. Blumenschein G.R. Cancer. 1985; 55: 2761-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Several reports suggest that DOX-induced apoptosis plays an important role in its cardiotoxicity that is linked to formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) derived from redox activation of DOX (3Sawyer D.B.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2288) Google Scholar). As a tumor suppressor, p53 is responsible for protecting cells from tumorigenic alterations (10Ko J.L. Prives C.

Mutational inactivation of p53 is frequently observed in various human cancers (12Sun Y. Oberley L.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 335-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Activation of p53, which in turn promotes apoptosis of tumor cells, is considered to be a key mechanism of action of antitumor drugs, including DOX (13Lowe S.W. Bodis S. McClatchey A. Remington L.

Various mutations of p53 and attenuation of p53 activation by DOX were reported as important mechanisms of drug resistance in tumor cells (15Magnelli L. Cinelli M. Chiarugi V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 16Anthoney D.A. McIlwrath A.J. Gallagher W.M. Edlin A.R. Brown R.

A. 1997; 94: 2345-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). However, relatively fewer studies have focused on the role of p53 in DOX-induced toxicity in endothelial cells, cardiomyocytes, and other non-cancerous cells. DOX was reported to induce ROS generation in various tumor cells (18Sinha B.K. Mimnaugh E.G. Rajagopalan S. Myers C.E. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3844-3848PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ubezio P. Civoli F.

Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 488-496PubMed Google Scholar). However, the exact role of ROS in DOX-induced tumor cell killing still remains uncertain and somewhat controversial. Several groups reported that inhibiting DOX-induced intracellular oxidative stress by the overexpression of antioxidant enzymes prevented apoptosis in tumor cells (20Gouaze V. Mirault M.E. Carpentier S. Salvayre R. Levade T. Andrieu-Abadie N. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 488-496PubMed Google Scholar, 21Suresh A. Guedez L. Moreb J. Zukali J. Br. J. Haematol. 2003; 120: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and that depleting endogenous antioxidants (e.g. glutathione) made tumor cells more susceptible to DOX (22Mallery S.R. Clark Y.M. Ness G.M. Minshawi O.M. Pei P. Hohl C.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 73: 259-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 23Poirson-Bichat F. Goncalves R.A. Miccoli L. Dutrillaux B. Poupon M.F. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 643-653PubMed Google Scholar). However, other studies did not support the role of oxidative stress in tumor cell apoptosis induced by DOX and other chemotherapeutic agents (24Shacter E. Williams J.A. Hinson R.M. Senturker S. Lee Y.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 307-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Senturker S. Tschirret-Guth R. Morrow J. Levine R. Shacter E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 262-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the effect of DOX-induced H2O2 and p53 in two non-transformed cell types (bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) and adult rat cardiomyocytes (ARCMs)), and two tumor cell lines (PA-1 and MCF-7). To our knowledge, we provide evidence, for the first time, that p53 and H2O2 have distinctly different roles in mediating DOX-induced apoptosis in these normal cell types and tumor cells. Although p53 plays a crucial role in tumor cell apoptosis, H2O2 is predominantly responsible for apoptosis in endothelial and myocardial cells. These results suggest that DOX-induced apoptosis is mediated by distinctly different signal transduction pathways in non-transformed and tumor cells, further suggesting that targeted drug development to attenuate DOX-induced side effects without compromising its chemotherapeutic effect is feasible. Materials—DOX and Pifithrin-α were purchased from Sigma and Tocris Cookson (Ellisville, MO), respectively. Carboxy-H2DCFDA (5- (and 6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichloro-dihydrofluorescein diacetate) was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx-1) expression plasmid was a generous gift from Dr. L. Oberley (University of Iowa, IA). Cell Culture—Both BAEC and PA-1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. BAECs were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS), l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml), incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. All experiments were performed in a similar medium containing 2% FBS. PA-1 cells were cultured in Eagle's Minimal Essential medium containing 10% FBS, l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), sodium pyruvate (1 mm), non-essential amino acids (0.1 mm), and sodium bicarbonate (1.5 g/L), incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. MCF-7 cells were a gift from Dr. C. Chitambar (Medical College of Wisconsin). These cells were cultured in MEM-α medium containing 10% FBS, 2 mm glutamine, 25 mm sodium bicarbonate, 10 μg/ml insulin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. MCF-7 cells were seeded 24 h before experiments and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Isolation and Culturing of Cardiomyocytes—Adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats (175 to 225 g of body weight) as described previously (26Konorev E.A. Zhang H. Joseph J. Kennedy M.C. Kalyanaraman B. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2000; 279: H2424-H2430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, hearts were perfused with collagenase type II (200 units/ml) (Invitrogen). After 30 min of perfusion, ventricular tissue was minced and incubated for 10 min in a perfusion buffer with 1% bovine serum albumin and 20 μg/ml deoxyribonuclease (Sigma). Cells were released from chunks of tissue by gentle pipetting. The cell suspension was filtered through an 80-mesh screen, washed twice by gentle centrifugation, and resuspended in a CaCl2-containing buffer. The concentration of CaCl2 in the buffer was successively increased to 0.2 and 0.5 mm. To separate myocytes, the cell suspension was layered over a 4% bovine serum albumin solution in a buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2. Ventricular myocytes were allowed to settle and then plated onto 60-mm dishes precoated with laminin. The culture medium was Medium 199 supplemented with 25 mm HEPES, 2 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin, 2 mm l-carnitine, 5 mm creatine, 5 mm taurine, 100 nm insulin, 100 IU/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin. Intact cardiomyocytes adhered to the culture plates, and damaged cells were washed away during the medium change 2 h after plating. Cardiomyocytes were pretreated with Fe(III) tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin (FeTBAP) (10 μm) or pifithrin-α (PFT-α) (5 μm) for 1 h and incubated with 0.5 μm DOX for 72 h. Luciferase Assay—Cells (1 × 105) suspended in 1 ml of complete medium were seeded into each well of a 12-well plate. After incubating at 37 °C for 24 h, cells were transiently transfected by 1 μg of p53-luciferase reporter plasmid and 1 μg of β-gal plasmid in the medium without FBS and antibiotics using the lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). The cells were incubated for 4 h, and then complete medium was added. Sixteen h later, the cells were starved for another 16 h in 2% FBS medium, followed by exposure to different treatments. The luciferase activity was determined using the luciferase assay system with reporter lysis buffer from Promega (Madison, WI). Briefly, the cells were harvested by scraping in 200 μl of reporter lysis buffer into a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube, vortexed for 15 s, and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 s, and then the supernatant cell lysates were collected. The luciferase activity was measured with 60 μl of cell lysate and 60 μl of substrate, using a Monolight luminometer. β-Galactosidase activity was determined as described previously (27Ye J. Ghosh P. Cippitelli M. Subleski J. Hardy K.J. Ortaldo J.R. Young H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25728-25734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results are expressed as the relative p53 activity compared with controls after normalizing for β-galactosidase activity and protein concentration. Measurement of Oxidative Stress—After treatment of cells with DOX, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed with PBS and incubated in 2 ml of fresh culture medium without FBS. 2′,7′-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate was added at a final concentration of 10 μm and incubated for 20 min. The cells were then washed twice with PBS and maintained in 1 ml of culture medium. Fluorescence was monitored using a Nikon fluorescence microscope equipped with a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter. Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase-mediated Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) Assay—The TUNEL assay was used for microscopic detection of apoptosis (28Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (9145) Google Scholar). This assay is based on labeling of 3′-free hydroxyl ends of the fragmented DNA with fluorescein-dUTP catalyzed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Procedures were followed according to the ApoAlert DNA fragmentation assay kit (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA). Apoptotic cells exhibit a strong nuclear green fluorescence that can be detected using a standard fluorescein filter (520 nm). All cells stained with propidium iodide exhibit a strong red fluorescence at 620 nm. The areas of apoptotic cells were detected by fluorescence microscopy equipped with rhodamine and fluorescein isothiocyanate filters. The photographs and quantification of apoptosis were obtained using a MetaMorph Imaging System (Universal Imaging Corporation). Caspase-3 Activity—The caspase-3-like activity is increased through a protease cascade during apoptosis in the early stage (29Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2180) Google Scholar). After treatment with DOX and other agents, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed with cell lysis buffer (caspase-3 assay kit, Sigma). Samples were incubated on ice for 10 min and centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to precipitate the cellular debris. The caspase-3 activity in the supernatant was measured in a spectrophotometer, using DEVD-p-nitroanilide as a substrate, according to the manufacturer's instructions provided with the assay kit. Alternatively, cells were washed twice in cold PBS and lysed in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4 (pH 7.5), 130 mm NaCl, 1% Triton, and 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate. Cell lysate was incubated with caspase-3 fluorogenic substrate N-acetyl-DEVD-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (BD Pharmingen) at 37 °C for 1 h. 7-Amino-4-methylcoumarin liberated from the fluorogenic substrate was measured using a fluorescence plate reader (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences) with λex = 380 nm and λem = 440 nm. Liberated fluorescence was normalized to cell lysate protein measured with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). DOX-induced Apoptosis and Caspase-3 Activation in BAECs and PA-1 Cells—Apoptosis was observed using the TUNEL technique in BAECs and PA-1 cells exposed to relatively low concentrations (0.1 to 0.5 μm) of DOX. As shown in Fig. 1A, after incubation with 0.5 μm DOX for 4 h, a significant increase in TUNEL-positive (apoptotic) cells was detected in BAECs. More apoptotic cells were observed with longer incubation times. Although a similar temporal pattern of apoptosis was observed in DOX-treated PA-1 tumor cells, the apoptotic response in PA-1 tumor cells was much lower than that of BAECs. Next we investigated the effect of DOX on caspase-3 activation, because caspase-3 is an important upstream factor leading to apoptosis (30Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with the TUNEL assay, we found that 0.5 μm DOX caused a significant increase in caspase-3 activation in BAECs and PA-1 cells after incubating for 4 and 8 h, respectively. The activation of caspase-3 increased with increasing incubation time, and the peak activation of caspase-3 was less in PA-1 cells than in BAECs (Fig. 1B). DOX-induced Apoptosis Is p53-independent in BAECs and ARCMs and p53-dependent in PA-1 and MCF-7 Cells—Fig. 2 shows the results of the luciferase assay for p53 activity measuring the ability of p53 as a transcription factor to regulate the expression of its target genes. BAECs and PA-1 cells, transiently transfected with the p53-luciferase plasmid, were exposed to different concentrations of DOX for 16 h. As shown in Fig. 2A, DOX induced a dose-dependent activation of p53 in BAECs and PA-1 cells, but the peak response was higher in PA-1 cells than in BAECs. Although similar dose-dependent patterns were found in endothelial cells and tumor cells, the time course of p53 activation induced by DOX was different (Fig. 2B). In BAECs, p53 was not activated until after an 8-h incubation with DOX, which is later than the onset of DOX-induced apoptosis described in Fig. 1A. In contrast, p53 was activated in PA-1 tumor cells starting at 2 h incubation with DOX. There was little or no apoptosis under these conditions (Fig. 1). The distinct differences in the activation profiles of p53 and apoptosis in these cells suggest that DOX-induced apoptosis is p53-independent in endothelial cells but p53-dependent in tumor cells. To further confirm the different roles of p53 (Fig. 2B), a p53 inhibitor, PFT-α was used. PFT-α blocks p53-dependent transcriptional activation (31Komarov P.G. Komarova E.A. Kondratov R.V. Christov-Tselkov K. Coon J.S. Chernov M.V. Gudkov A.V. Science. 1999; 285: 1733-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, the addition of PFT-α abolished p53 activation induced by DOX in both BAECs and PA-1. The inhibition of p53 in BAECs did not decrease the apoptosis; in contrast, it attenuated DOX-induced apoptosis by ∼50% in PA-1 tumor cells (Fig. 3B). We also assessed DOX-induced apoptosis in primary cardiomyocytes (ARCMs) and human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) cells. Pretreatment with p53 inhibitor significantly decreased caspase-3 activity in DOX-treated MCF-7 cells (Fig. 3C). However, the antiapoptotic effect of PFT-α was only marginal in ARCMs treated with DOX. These results indicate that although p53 became activated after DOX treatment in endothelial cells, it does not regulate the apoptotic pathway in BAECs and ARCMs. On the other hand, p53 inhibitor significantly diminished DOX-induced apoptosis in tumor PA-1 and MCF-7 cells. H2O2 Generation in DOX-treated BAECs and PA-1 Cells— DOX has been reported to generate ROS in various cells (3Sawyer D.B. Fukazawa R. Arstall M.A. Kelly R.A. Circ.

Salvayre R. Levade T. Andrieu-Abadie N. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 488-496PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the role of oxidative stress in DOX-induced apoptosis, we used carboxy-H2DCFDA, a cell-permeable fluorescent dye, to examine the ROS generation in both types of cells in response to DOX stimulation. Incubation with DOX for 4 h showed a considerable increase in oxidant-induced 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein fluorescence in BAECs but not in PA-1 cells (Fig. 4). H2O2-mediated DCF fluorescence occurred after 2 h incubation with DOX in BAECs and increased in intensity over time; however, in PA-1 cells there was no significant change in DCF fluorescence with DOX treatment (Fig. 4). This suggests that DOX, under these conditions, does not induce intracellular oxidative stress in tumor cells. Effects of Supplementation with Antioxidants, FeTBAP and GPx-1, on DOX-induced Apoptosis and Caspase-3 Activation—To further investigate the role of ROS in DOX-induced apoptosis, we used a redox-active metalloporphyrin FeTBAP that was reported to detoxify superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and peroxynitrite (32Kalish H. Camp J.E. Stepien M. Latos-Grazynski L. Balch A.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 11719-11727Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Pre-incubation of endothelial cells with 10 μm FeTBAP significantly decreased the DOX-induced p53 activation by 60% but had no appreciable effect on p53 activation in PA-1 cells (Fig. 5A). Treatment with ROS scavenger, FeTBAP, resulted in decreased apoptosis and caspase-3 activation in BAECs and ARCMs (Fig. 5, B and C). In contrast, FeTBAP was not effective in preventing DOX-induced apoptosis in tumor cells PA-1 and MCF-7 cells.Fig. 5Effect of FeTBAP on DOX-induced p53 activation and apoptosis. A, the luciferase assay for DOX-induced p53 activation. Transfected BAECs (left) and PA-1 cells (right) were pretreated for 2 h with FeTBAP and incubated with 0.5 μm DOX for 16 h, and p53 activity was measured by luciferase activity assay. B, BAECs and PA-1 cells were pretreated with FeTBAP for 2 h and incubated with DOX (0.5 μm) for 16 h, stained for TUNEL-positive cells, and examined by fluorescence microscopy. Similar treatments were performed with DOX in the absence of FeTBAP. The average intensity values were obtained from three different fields of view obtained using MetaMorph software. C, cells were pretreated with 10 μm FeTBAP and incubated with 0.5 μm DOX for 16 h (BAEC, PA-1), 48 h (MCF-7), and 72 h (ARCM). Cells were lysed as described in “Experimental Procedures.” Cell lysates were used to measure caspase-3 activity in BAECs and PA-1 cells using a colorimetric caspase-3 substrate, or a fluorogenic caspase-3 substrate in MCF-7 and ARCM cells. Caspase-3 activity was normalized to cell lysate protein and expressed as fold activation as compared with control. Results are presented as mean ± S.E. of three separate experiments. Single asterisks indicate a significant increase as compared with control; double asterisks indicate a significant decrease compared with DOX treatment (p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Alternatively, we increased the level of GPx-1, an intracellular enzymatic scavenger of H2O2, by introducing the GPx-1 expression plasmid into the cells (33Li Q. Sanlioglu S. Li S. Ritchie T. Oberley L. Engelhardt J.F. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2001; 3: 415-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In GPx-1-transfected BAECs treated with DOX, a reduction in p53 activation was observed (Fig. 6A). Overexpression of GPx-1 almost completely inhibited the apoptosis induced by DOX (Fig. 6B), and the caspase-3 activity was dramatically decreased with GPx-1 overexpression coincidently (Fig. 6C). On the contrary, the overexpression of GPx-1 did not have any effect on DOX-induced p53 activation, apoptosis, and caspase-3 activity in PA-1 cells (Fig. 6). These results indicate that both chemical and enzymatic detoxification of H2O2 in BAECs inhibit DOX-induced apoptosis and caspase-3 activation. However, H2O2 does not play an important role in regulating DOX-induced apoptosis in tumor cells. In this study, we demonstrate that DOX induces apoptosis in normal cell types and tumor cells via different mechanisms. In endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes, DOX induced apoptosis by a H2O2-mediated mechanism and is largely independent of p53 activation. In contrast, p53 tumor suppressor, and not H2O2, plays a crucial role in inducing apoptosis by DOX in tumor cells. Numerous reports indicate that p53 tumor suppressor protein is important in regulating the apoptosis pathway, but relatively little is known about the role of p53 in apoptosis induced by DOX in endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes. It has been reported that DOX-induced activation of p53 lead to apoptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and neonatal cardiomyocytes (34Lorenzo E. Ruiz-Ruiz C. Quesada A.J. Hernandez G.

Although the present findings indicate that DOX treatment activates p53, this activation did not play any significant role in the apoptosis process in BAECs and adult cardiomyocytes. This conclusion, albeit contrary to previous reports, is based on the following observations: i) apoptosis in endothelial cells was observed at 4 h after DOX incubation, but significant p53 activation occurred only at 8 h after DOX treatment, and ii) p53 inhibition by PFT-α did not decrease DOX-induced apoptosis in endothelial cells and primary cardiomyocytes. In contrast to the endothelial cell results, we found that p53 did play an important role in tumor cell apoptosis, as reported previously (13Lowe S.W. Bodis S. McClatchey A. Remington L. Ruley H.E.

The activation of p53 in human ovarian teratocarcinoma PA-1 cells occurred before the onset of apoptosis, i.e. 2 h after DOX treatment. p53 inhibitor PFT-α effectively blocked DOX-induced apoptosis in human ovarian teratocarcinoma (PA-1) and in human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) cells. It has been reported that caspase-3 essentially acts as a downstream regulator of p53 in stress-induced apoptosis (34Lorenzo E. Ruiz-Ruiz C. Quesada A.J. Hernandez G. Rodriguez A. Lopez-Rivas A.

These results indicate that disabling p53 transcriptional activity with PFT-α (38Culmsee C. Zhu X. Yu Q. Chan S.L. Camandola S. Guo Z. Greg N.H. Mattson M.P. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 39Komarova E.A. Gudkov A.V. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 62: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) in two tumor cell lines effectively blocks caspase-3 activity and DNA fragmentation. Besides p53, NF-κB, another transcription factor, is also involved in DOX-induced cellular responses. Previously, we reported that NF-κB is pro-apoptotic in DOX-treated endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes, which is contrary to its usual anti-apoptotic role in various cancer cells (40Wang S. Kotamraju S. Konorev E. Kalivendi S. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The cellular modulatory functions of p53 and NF-κB overlap in many respects, but results have been controversial. NF-κB has been reported to up-regulate the gene expression of p53 (41Wu H. Lozano G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20067-20074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Pei X.H. Nakanishi Y. Takayama K. Bai F. Hara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35240-35246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, other groups reported that NF-κB and p53 inhibit each other's function (43Pise-Masison C.A.

Cell. Biochem. 2004; 255: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that inhibiting NF-κB activation did not have significant effects on p53 activation by DOX in endothelial cells, whereas p53 inhibitor did abolish NF-κB activation by DOX (data not shown). These results suggest that p53 does not act as the downstream regulator for NF-κB-mediated apoptosis but does play a tangible role that is upstream of NF-κB activation. The role of ROS in inducing apoptosis in myocytes and endothelial cells is well established (3Sawyer D.B. Fukazawa R. Arstall M.A. Kelly R.A. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 5Kotamraju S. Konorev E.A. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol.

Med. 2002; 33: 988-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The present study provides additional evidence in support of intracellular H2O2 as a mediator in DOX-induced endothelial apoptosis. Pretreatment with FeTBAP, a cell-permeable metalloporphyrin antioxidant enzyme mimetic, dramatically decreased DOX-induced caspase-3 activation and apoptosis in endothelial cells. FeTBAP, a redox-active metalloporphyrin, consists of a redoxactive iron (III) located at the center of a porphyrin ring. Recent reports indicate that FeTBAP is an efficient scavenger of both superoxide and H2O2 and protects cardiomyocytes against DOX-induced apoptosis (32Kalish H. Camp J.E. Stepien M. Latos-Grazynski L. Balch A.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 11719-11727Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 45Konorev E.A. Kotamraju S. Zhao H. Kalivendi S. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B.

Transient transfection of BAECs with GPx-1 expression plasmid also resulted in a dramatic reduction of DOX-induced caspase-3 activation and apoptosis, suggesting that H2O2 plays a crucial role in DOX-induced apoptosis in endothelial cells. The intermediacy of ROS in apoptotic signal transduction in cancer cells still remains questionable (20Gouaze V. Mirault M.E. Carpentier S. Salvayre R. Levade T. Andrieu-Abadie N. Mol.

Tschirret-Guth R. Morrow J. Levine R. Shacter E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 262-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The present study shows that DOX did not induce H2O2 generation to any significant extent in PA-1 cells. Addition of FeTBAP and over-expression of GPx-1 did not cause any significant effect on p53 activation, caspase-3 activation, and apoptosis by DOX in PA-1 tumor cells. The differential effects of free radical scavengers in DOX-mediated apoptosis in normal and tumor cells are noteworthy. For example, DOX-induced transferrin receptor-mediated uptake of iron mediated through enhanced activation of iron regulatory protein-iron response element interaction was inhibited by antioxidant treatment in endothelial cells but not in tumor cells (46Kwok J.C. Richardson D.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 888-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Results obtained in the present study implicate that in human tumor MCF-7 and PA-1 cells, H2O2 is not involved in p53-dependent apoptosis induced by DOX. In summary, results from the present study strongly suggest that DOX-induced apoptosis occurs through a different signal transduction mechanism in non-transformed cells, such as endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes (H2O2-dependent), as compared with tumor cells (p53-dependent). This difference in mechanism provides a unique strategy for minimizing DOX cardiotoxicity without mitigating its antitumor potential. It is conceivable that transfection of the wild-type p53 into the target tumor cells will sensitize the tumors to DOX treatment."

Many SLC26 transporters (SLC26T) are expressed in the luminal membrane together with CFTR7, which activates electrogenic chloride-bicarbonate exchange by SLC26T8. However, the ability of SLC26T to regulate CFTR and the molecular mechanism of their interaction are not known. We report here a reciprocal regulatory interaction between the SLC26T DRA, SLC26A6 and CFTR. DRA markedly activates CFTR by increasing its overall open probablity (NPo) sixfold. Activation of CFTR by DRA was facilitated by their PDZ ligands and binding of the SLC26T STAS domain to the CFTR R domain. Binding of the STAS and R domains is regulated by PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the R domain. Notably, CFTR and SLC26T co-localize in the luminal membrane and recombinant STAS domain activates CFTR in native duct cells. These findings provide a new understanding of epithelial chloride and bicarbonate transport and may have important implications for both cystic fibrosis and diseases associated with SLC26T."

https://openalex.org/W2075320283,"Many members of the chemokine receptor family of G protein-coupled receptors utilize multiple endogenous ligands. However, differences between the signaling properties of multiple chemokines through a single receptor have yet to be well characterized. In this study we investigated the early signaling events of CCR7 initiated by its two endogenous ligands, CCL19 and CCL21. Both CCL19 and CCL21 induce G protein activation and calcium mobilization with equal potency. However, only activation by CCL19, not CCL21, promotes robust desensitization of endogenous CCR7 in the human T cell lymphoma cell line H9. Desensitization occurs through the induction of receptor phosphorylation and β-arrestin recruitment (shown in HEK293 cells expressing CCR7-FLAG). The sites of CCL19-induced phosphorylation were mapped by mutating to alanines the serines and threonines found within kinase phosphorylation consensus sequences in the carboxyl terminus of CCR7. A cluster of sites, including Thr-373-376 and Ser-378 is important for CCL19-mediated phosphorylation of the receptor, whereas residues serine 356, 357, 364, and 365 are important for basal receptor phosphorylation by protein kinase C. Activation of CCR7 by both ligands leads to signaling to the ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. However, CCL19 promotes 4-fold more ERK1/2 phosphorylation than does CCL21. The mechanism by which CCL19 activates ERK1/2 was determined to be β-arrestin-dependent, because it is reduced both by depletion of β-arrestin-2 with small interfering RNA and by elimination of the phosphorylation sites in the tail of the receptor. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that CCL19 and CCL21 place CCR7 in functionally distinct conformations that are independent of their G protein-coupling potency: one that allows the efficient desensitization of the receptor and activation of ERK1/2, and another that is impaired in these functions.

These ligand clusters can be derived from different gene transcripts or from differential processing of a common transcript or precursor protein. The variety of pro-opiomelanocortin-derived peptides active at melanocortin receptors is an example of the latter (1Gantz I. Fong T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: E468-E474Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), whereas the various families of chemokines may provide the most extensive example of the former (2Rossi D. Zlotnik A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 217-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2090) Google Scholar). In the chemokine family, despite numerous receptors that recognize multiple endogenous chemokines, functional differences between ligands have yet to be well characterized.The CC chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) is expressed on T lymphocytes and is the central regulator of homing and trafficking of lymphocytes into and within the secondary lymphoid tissues (3Campbell J.J. Butcher E.C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 336-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). CCR7 has two endogenous ligands, CCL19 (ELC and MIP3β) and CCL21 (SLC, Exodus-2, 6-Ckine and TCA-4), both of which are full agonists with similar receptor binding affinities and chemotactic potencies (4Sullivan S.K. McGrath D.A. Grigoriadis D. Bacon K.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 5Yoshida R. Nagira M. Kitaura M. Imagawa N. Imai T. Yoshie O. J.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3670-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, the reason for the existence of two endogenous ligands for CCR7 is not clear. However, the possibility that they have different regulatory effects on CCR7 has been largely unexplored.Like all chemokine receptors, CCR7 initiates signal transduction through activation of members of the Gi family of heterotrimeric G proteins (7Thelen M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). When CCL19 or CCL21 binds CCR7 the heterotrimeric Gi complex is activated and dissociates into its α and βγ subunits. The released Gαi subunit inhibits adenylyl cyclase, and the Gβγ dimer activates two major signaling enzymes, phospholipase Cβ (8Scandella E. Men Y. Legler D.F. Gillessen S. Prikler L. Ludewig B. Groettrup M. Blood. 2004; 103: 1595-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (9Constantin G. Majeed M. Giagulli C. Piccio L. Kim J.Y. Butcher E.C. Laudanna C. Immunity. 2000; 13: 759-769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), which initiate the activation of downstream targets, such as calcium mobilization and Akt, respectively.In addition to activation of signaling pathways, GPCRs also undergo the regulatory process of desensitization. Desensitization results in diminished responsiveness of GPCRs to repeated or prolonged exposure to agonist. This process requires phosphorylation of the receptor tail by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) to promote the binding of β-arrestins, which uncouple the receptor from its cognate G protein (10Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Recent evidence also suggests that β-arrestins contribute to GPCR signaling by functioning as scaffolds for the recruitment of signaling molecules into a complex with the agonist-occupied receptors (11Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 455-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several members of the c-Src family of tyrosine kinases such as c-Src, Hck, c-Fgr, and Yes are translocated to GPCRs by binding to β-arrestin (12Perry S.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 130-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Activation of the CXC-chemokine receptor-1 by interleukin 8 induces the formation of a β-arrestin complex with Hck and c-Fgr, which is essential for granule release in neutrophils (13Barlic J. Andrews J.D. Kelvin A.A. Bosinger S.E. DeVries M.E. Xu L. Dobransky T. Feldman R.D. Ferguson S.S. Kelvin D.J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Similarly, β-arrestins can scaffold various members of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways (11Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 455-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Perry S.J. Lefkowitz R.J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 49212-49219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). For example, β-arrestins directly interact with c-Raf-1 and ERKs 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and promote ERK1/2 activation (15Luttrell L.M. Roudabush F.L. Choy E.W. Miller W.E. Field M.E. Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2449-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Several GPCRs have been shown to activate ERK1/2 in this manner, including the angiotensin type 1A receptor (AT1AR) (15Luttrell L.M. Roudabush F.L. Choy E.W. Miller W.E. Field M.E. Pierce K.L.

H9 T cell lymphoma cells were maintained in RPMI medium 1640 supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and penicillin-streptomycin. Rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells and human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and penicillin-streptomycin. Transfections of HEK293 cells on 10-cm dishes were performed with 5 μg of plasmid and 15 μl of FuGENE6 (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stable clones were selected and maintained with 1 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). Transfections of HEK293 cells plated on 10-cm dishes with β-arrestin-2 small interfering RNA (siRNA) (Qiagen) were performed with 20 μm siRNA and 50 μl of GeneSilencer (Gene Therapy Systems) as previously described (17Ahn S.

Commun. 1999; 263: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) with a FLAG tag added to the carboxyl terminus. The CCR7(-S/4T), CCR7(-SS/SS), and CCR7(-ALL) mutations were introduced into the pcDNA3.1-CCR7-FLAG clone using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All mutations were verified by DNA sequence analysis. The pcDNA3.1-β-arrestin-2 construct was prepared by amplifying the β-arrestin-2 coding sequence from a human brain cDNA library (BD Biosciences Clontech) with primers that also encoded the restriction sites for EcoRI and BamHI; the PCR product was digested and ligated into the equivalent sites of the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen).Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS) Analysis of Cell Surface CCR7 Expression—CCR7 expression on stably transfected HEK293 cells were determined by FACS analysis. The CCR7 was detected with a phycoerythrin-conjugated rat anti-human CCR7 antibody and normalized to the isotype control, phycoerythrin-conjugated rat IgG2a, κ (BD Pharmingen). Samples were acquired and analyzed using a FAC-SCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).Ligands—CCL19 was synthesized by solid-phase methodology on a CS536 Peptide Synthesizer (CS Bio), as previously described (6Ott T.R. Lio F.M. Olshefski D. Liu X.-J. Struthers R.S. Ling N. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3670-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The synthesized CCL19 contained a substitution at Met-72 for norleucine to enhance the stability of the peptide. This substitution was shown to be silent in its binding affinity for CCR7 and in multiple functional assays (6Ott T.R. Lio F.M. Olshefski D. Liu X.-J. Struthers R.S. Ling N. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3670-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). CCL21 was obtained from ID Laboratories.Receptor Desensitization Assay—1.5-2.0 × 108 H9 cells were centrifuged and resuspended in serum-free media (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). The cells were transferred to three 10-cm plates and stimulated with either 100 nm CCL19 or 100 nm CCL21 for 10 min at 37 °C, or left untreated. After stimulation the cells were washed twice for 5 min with 20 ml of ice-cold acid wash buffer (90 mm NaCl and 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 4.5) to remove bound ligand. The cells were then washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and membranes were prepared.Membrane Preparation—Membranes from H9 cells were prepared as previously described (6Ott T.R. Lio F.M. Olshefski D. Liu X.-J. Struthers R.S. Ling N. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3670-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, H9 cells were washed with PBS, resuspended in ice-cold membrane buffer (20 mm HEPES, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2), and homogenized by Dounce homogenization (60 strokes). The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,200 rpm and 4 °C for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was subsequently centrifuged at 20,000 rpm and 4 °C for 45 min. The membrane pellet was resuspended in membrane buffer, and protein concentration was determined by BCA Protein assay (Pierce).[35S]GTPγS Binding Assays—Guanine nucleotide exchange assays were performed, as previously described (6Ott T.R. Lio F.M. Olshefski D. Liu X.-J. Struthers R.S. Ling N. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3670-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes were incubated in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% BSA, 10 μm GDP, and 500 pm [35S]GTPγS with various concentrations of CCL19 and CCL21 for 30 min at 37 °C. Incorporated [35S]GTPγS was measured in a liquid scintillation counter.Intracellular Calcium Assay—RBL cells stably expressing CCR7 (RBL-CCR7) were grown overnight at 8 × 105 cells per well in a 96-well poly-d-lysine-coated plate. After 24 h, 100 μl of Calcium 3 Assay Reagent solution (1× Hanks' balanced salt solution, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm probenecid, and FLIPR Calcium 3 Assay Reagent (Molecular Devices)) was added directly to the cells. The assay plate was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. A 96-well plate with various concentrations of CCL19 and CCL21 diluted in 1× Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.1% BSA, and 20 mm HEPES was prepared. Both the assay plate and the peptide dilution plate were run on an ImageTrak Epi-Fluorescence system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).[32P]Orthophosphate (32Pi) Labeling and Receptor Immunoprecipitations—HEK293 cells stably expressing CCR7-FLAG (HEK-CCR7-FLAG cells) were serum-starved in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 for 1 h. Cells were labeled with 100 μCi/ml 32Pi (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 1 h, then 100 nm microcystin-LF (Calbiochem) was added, and the cells were incubated for a further 15 min. Cells were stimulated with the appropriate ligand for 10 min at 37 °C, or left untreated. Cells were washed twice with PBS, and cell extracts were prepared by lysing cells in 500 μl of glycerol lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 100 μm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 100 nm microcystin-LF, and Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science)). The samples were clarified by centrifugation, and CCR7-FLAG was then immunoprecipitated from 2.0 mg of protein with 50 μl of M2 anti-FLAG-agarose conjugate (Sigma) for 16 h with constant rotation. Immunoprecipitates were washed five times with glycerol buffer and eluted with 50 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) supplemented with 200 mm dl-1,4-dithiothreitol. Equal volumes of the immunoprecipitates were resolved on two 4-20% Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen). One gel was dried to measure 32Pi incorporation using a phosphorimaging device (Bio-Rad); the second gel was transferred onto nitrocellulose filter and immunoblotted with M2 anti-FLAG-horseradish peroxidase antibody conjugate. Bands were quantitated on a VersaDoc3000 Imaging System (Bio-Rad) and used to normalize the 32Pi incorporation to the amount of receptor immunoprecipitated.Translocation of β-Arrestin-2 Assay—HEK-CCR7-FLAG cells were transiently transfected with β-arrestin-2. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were stimulated with 100 nm CCL19 or 100 nm CCL21 for the appropriate times, or left untreated. Cells were washed and lysed with 700 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 100 μm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, and protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science)). After clarification CCR7-FLAG was immunoprecipitated with M2 anti-FLAG-agarose conjugate for 16 h with constant rotation. To reduce nonspecific binding to the M2-agarose beads, the beads and the Eppendorf tubes used for the immunoprecipitation were preblocked with 3% BSA in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). Immunoprecipitates were washed five times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, eluted with 50 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter and immunoblotted with anti-β-arrestin antibody (Calbiochem) diluted 1:500 in 1% nonfat dried milk in TBST. Detection of immunoreactive proteins was performed with chemiluminescence using the SuperSignal West Pico reagent (Pierce) and quantified on the VersaDoc3000 Imaging System (Bio-Rad).Activation of ERK1/2 Assay—HEK293 cells stably expressing CCR7 or CCR7 mutants were serum-starved for 1 h and stimulated with the corresponding ligands for 5 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed once with PBS and harvested directly into 2× SDS sample buffer. Cell extracts were sonicated, heated at 55 °C for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Resolved proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The activated phosphorylated form of ERK1/2 was detected using an anti-phosphoMAPK p42/44 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) diluted at 1:3000 in 1% nonfat dried milk in TBST. Total ERK1/2 was detected with the anti-ERK2 antibody (K23, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Chemiluminescent detection was performed with SuperSignal West Pico reagent (Pierce) and quantified on the VersaDoc3000 Imaging System (Bio-Rad).Data Analysis—Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Dose-response data were plotted and analyzed (-log EC50 determination) with Graph-Pad Prism software. Statistical significance between dose-response curves was determined with a two-way ANOVA test. Statistical significance between single doses was determined by an unpaired, two-tailed t test. When comparing -fold stimulation with basal stimulation, statistical significance was determined by a paired, two-tailed t test. p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.RESULTSStimulation with CCL19 but Not CCL21 Induces Desensitization of CCR7 in H9 Cells—GPCRs become desensitized after stimulation, resulting in a reduction in their ability to couple to G proteins following subsequent exposure to their ligands. Because CCR7 has two endogenous ligands, we compared the ability of CCL19 and CCL21 to desensitize CCR7. H9 cells (a human T cell lymphoma cell line that expresses CCR7 endogenously) were pretreated for 10 min with either 100 nm CCL19 or CCL21, or left untreated. Membranes were prepared and the ability of a second stimulation with CCL19 or CCL21 to mediate GTP exchange on G proteins was measured. Cells that were not pretreated with agonist stimulated GTP exchange equally efficiently after receptor activation with either CCL19 or CCL21 (Fig. 1). Membranes prepared from cells pretreated with CCL19, however, were significantly impaired in CCR7-G protein coupling when rechallenged with either CCL19 or CCL21. There was a 58.1 ± 7.4% decrease in the maximum GTP exchange in membranes pretreated with CCL19 when restimulated with CCL19 (Fig. 1A), and 57.9 ± 5.3% after restimulation with CCL21 (Fig. 1B), compared with membranes that received no pretreatment. However, pretreatment with CCL21 had no effect on the ability of either CCL19 (Fig. 1A) or CCL21 (Fig. 1B) to promote GTP loading, indicating that CCL21 cannot efficiently desensitize CCR7. Similar desensitization profiles were obtained in HEK293 cells expressing CCR7-FLAG (data not shown). This difference would be explained if the two agonists differed in their potency. To test this, we compared the ability of CCL19 and CCL21 to activate CCR7 using both G protein loading assays and downstream signaling assays. Fig. 2A shows that CCL19 and CCL21 stimulate equivalent levels of GTPγS loading of H9 cell membranes. Furthermore, CCL19 and CCL21 are equipotent at promoting calcium mobilization in RBL cells that are stably transfected with CCR7 (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these data show that, despite CCL19 and CCL21 being equally potent at activating CCR7, only CCL19 is capable of inducing receptor desensitization.Fig. 2CCL19 and CCL21 are equipotent for the activation of CCR7-G protein coupling and Ca2+ mobilization. A, membranes prepared from H9 cells were stimulated with increasing concentrations of CCL19 or CCL21, and GTPγS binding was measured. The calculated -log EC50 (EC50, nm) for CCL19- and CCL21-stimulated GTPγS binding were 7.63 ± 0.18 (23.4 nm) and 7.87 ± 0.32 (13.5 nm), respectively. Data are the mean ± S.E. of four experiments. B, RBL cells stably expressing CCR7 were stimulated with various concentrations of CCL19 and CCL21, and the resulting Ca2+ flux was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The calculated -log EC50 (EC50, nm) for CCL19- and CCL21-stimulated Ca2+ flux were 7.27 ± 0.18 (53.7 nm) and 7.27 ± 0.16 (53.7 nm), respectively. Data are the mean ± S.E. of six experiments. GTPγS binding and Ca2+ mobilization data were plotted as the -fold stimulation by dividing the agonist-stimulated response by the basal response.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)CCR7 Phosphorylation Is Induced by CCL19 but Not CCL21—Phosphorylation of most GPCRs is a necessary step for their desensitization. Therefore, we compared the ability of CCL19 and CCL21 to induce CCR7 phosphorylation to determine whether this correlated with the difference we observed in the receptor desensitization profiles of the two ligands. HEK293 cells expressing FLAG-tagged CCR7 (HEK-CCR7-FLAG cells) were metabolically labeled with 32Pi and stimulated with various concentrations of the two agonists to induce receptor phosphorylation. Receptor molecules were then isolated by immunoprecipitation, and the amount of 32Pi incorporated was determined. A substantial level of basal phosphorylation of CCR7 was evident prior to stimulation with ligand (Fig. 3A). However, this level of phosphorylation increased in a dose-dependent manner following treatment with CCL19, but was almost unchanged when the receptor was stimulated with CCL21: phosphorylation of CCR7 increased by 83% over basal levels with CCL19 stimulation, whereas CCL21 promoted a maximal 32Pi incorporation of only 18% (Fig. 3, A and B).Fig. 3CCL19 and CCL21-induced CCR7 phosphorylation. HEK-CCR7-FLAG cells or HEK293 cells stably transfected with the empty vector (pC3) were metabolically labeled with 32Pi. HEK-CCR7-FLAG cells were stimulated with increasing concentrations of CCL19 or CCL21 for 10 min. A, an image showing the 32Pi incorporation from a representative experiment is shown. B, quantitation of phosphorylation was calculated by normalizing the 32Pi incorporation to the total CCR7 immunoprecipitated for each sample. The data graphed are the mean ± S.E. of 4-9 experiments. Phosphorylation is expressed as percentage over basal, which was calculated by ((stimulated/basal) - 1) × 100.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To identify which kinases affect CCR7 phosphorylation, cells were pretreated with specific inhibitors of the second messenger-dependent kinases, cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC). Whereas the PKA inhibitor H89 had no effect on either the basal or the CCL19-stimulated phosphorylation of CCR7, the PKC inhibitor GF109203X (bisindolylmaleimide I) significantly inhibited the basal and the agonist-stimulated phosphorylation of the receptor (Fig. 4, A and B).Fig. 4Effects of PKA and PKC inhibition on CCL19-mediated CCR7 phosphorylation. HEK-CCR7-FLAG cells were incubated overnight with 2 μm GF109203X or incubated for 2 h with 10 μm H89. Cells were metabolically labeled with 32Pi in the continued presence of the kinase inhibitors, then stimulated for 10 min with and without 30 nm CCL19. A, an image showing the 32Pi incorporation from a representative experiment is shown. B, quantitation of phosphorylation was calculated by normalizing the 32Pi incorporation to the total CCR7 immunoprecipitated for each sample. Phosphorylation is expressed as -fold over basal of the WT CCR7. A paired two-tailed t test was performed to compare effect of kinase inhibitors on the basal CCR7 phosphorylation (*, p < 0.001) and on the CCL19-stimulated phosphorylation (‡, p < 0.01). The data graphed are the mean ± S.E. of three to six experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Identification of Phosphorylation Sites on CCR7—The carboxyl-terminal domain of CCR7 contains several serine and threonine residues that represent potential sites for GPCR kinase (GRK) and second messenger kinase-mediated receptor phosphorylation. To identify which of these sites are phosphorylated on CCR7, three CCR7 mutants were constructed in which various groups of serines and threonines were mutated to alanines (Fig. 5A): CCR7(-S/4T) lacks the carboxyl-terminal cluster, Ser-378 and Thr-373/374/375/376; CCR7(-SS/SS) lacks the PKC and PKA consensus phosphorylation sites of Ser-365/364/357/356; CCR7(-All) lacks both sets of sites mutated in the (-S/4T) and (-SS/SS) receptors. These mutant receptors were stably expressed in HEK293 cells at equivalent levels, and the effect the mutations had on basal and CCL19-stimulated phosphorylation of the receptor was examined. Fig. 5 (B and C) shows that CCL19-mediated phosphorylation was reduced by 74% in CCR7(-S/4T) as compared with wild type (WT) CCR7, whereas its basal phosphorylation was unaffected (Fig. 5D); CCR7(-SS/SS) displayed a 63% inhibition of basal phosphorylation compared with WT CCR7 (Fig. 5, B and D), whereas its ability to undergo agonist-mediated phosphorylation was unchanged (Fig. 5, B and C). Interestingly, the phosphorylation pattern of the (-SS/SS) mutant paralleled that of the WT receptor when treated with a PKC inhibitor (Fig. 4), indicating that the basal phosphorylation by PKC occurs at some or all of these sites. Lastly, the CCR7(-All) mutant, which contains both sets of mutations, was defective in both its basal and CCL19-mediated phosphorylation (Fig. 5, B-D). These data suggest that most of the sites of CCL19-stimulated phosphorylation reside within the string of residues in the distal portion of the tail of the receptor, and basal phosphorylation by PKC occurs at one or more serines at positions 356, 357, 364, and 365.Fig. 5Mutational analysis of phosphorylation sites on CCR7. A, schematic diagram of CCR7 indicating the residues on the carboxyl terminus that were mutated to alanines. Three mutants were generated for this study: CCR7(-S/4T) has Ser-378 and"

Platelet dysfunction is common. Affected infants do not thrive and usually die in the first year of life1,2,3,4,5. To elucidate the molecular basis of ARC, we mapped the disease to a 7-cM interval on 15q26.1 and then identified germline mutations in the gene VPS33B in 14 kindreds with ARC.

https://openalex.org/W2151601609,"Cytogenetic aberrations have been reported in 45,000 human neoplasms. Structural balanced rearrangements are associated with distinct tumor subtypes with remarkable specificity and have been essential for identifying genes involved in tumorigenesis1,2. All balanced rearrangements that have been characterized molecularly act by deregulating a gene in one of the breakpoints or by creating a fusion gene3,4,5,6. Because most recurrent aberrations and rearranged genes have been found in hematological disorders, whereas numerous genomic imbalances have been identified in solid tumors7,8, it has become generally accepted that there are pathogenetic differences between these neoplasms. We here show that in every tumor type, the numbers of recurrent balanced chromosome abnormalities, fusion genes and genes rearranged as a consequence of balanced aberrations are simply a function of the number of cases with an abnormal karyotype. Hence, there may not be any fundamental tissue-specific differences in the genetic mechanisms by which neoplasia is initiated."

This study tests the novel hypothesis that the initial sarcolemmal breakdown resulting from dystrophin deficiency is exacerbated by inflammatory cells and that cytokines, specifically tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), contribute to muscle necrosis. To block in vivo TNFalpha bioactivity, young dystrophic mdx mice (a model for DMD) were injected weekly from 7 days of age with the anti-TNFalpha antibody Remicade before the onset of muscle necrosis and dystropathology that normally occurs at 21 days postnatally. The extent of inflammation, muscle necrosis, and myotube formation was measured by histological analysis from 18 to 28 days and muscle damage was also visualized by penetration of Evans blue dye into myofibers. Data from Remicade-treated and control mdx mice were compared with mdx/TNFalpha-/- mice that lack TNFalpha. Pharmacological blockade of TNFalpha activity with Remicade clearly delayed and greatly reduced the breakdown of dystrophic muscle, in marked contrast to the situation in mdx and mdx/TNFalpha-/- mice. Remicade had no adverse effect on new muscle formation. Remicade is a highly specific anti-inflammatory intervention, and clinical application to muscular dystrophies is suggested by this marked protective effect against skeletal muscle breakdown."

A. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 13775–13783). In this study, the role of endogenous nSMase2 in regulating growth arrest was investigated. The results show that endogenous nSMase2 mRNA was up-regulated ∼5-fold when MCF7 cells became growth-arrested at confluence, and total neutral SMase activity was increased by 119 ± 41% with respect to control. Cell cycle analysis showed that up-regulation of endogenous nSMase2 correlated with G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and an increase in total ceramide levels (2.4-fold). Analysis of ceramide species showed that confluence caused selective increases in very long chain ceramide C24:1 (370 ± 54%) and C24:0 (266 ± 81%) during arrest. The role of endogenous nSMase2 in growth regulation and ceramide metabolism was investigated using short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated loss-of-function analysis. Down-regulation of nSMase2 with specific siRNA increased the cell population of cells in S phase of the cell cycle by 59 ± 14% and selectively reverted the effects of growth arrest on the increase in levels of very long chain ceramides. Mechanistically, confluence arrest also induced hypophosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (6-fold) and induction of p21WAF1 (3-fold). Down-regulation of nSMase2 with siRNA largely prevented the dephosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein and the induction of p21WAF1, providing a link between the action of nSMase2 and key regulators of cell cycle progression. Moreover, studies on nSMase2 localization in MCF7 cells showed that nSMase2 distributed throughout the cells in subconfluent, proliferating cultures. In contrast, nSMase2 became nearly exclusively located at the plasma membrane in confluent, contact-inhibited cells. Hence, we demonstrate for the first time that nSMase2 functions as a growth suppressor in MCF7 cells, linking confluence to the G0/G1 cell cycle check point.

The diversity of the response is probably due to multiple factors including the magnitude of ceramide generation, the source of ceramide, the subcellular localization of the generated ceramide, and the effects of other regulatory factors such as protein kinase C and Bcl2.

Pushkareva M.Y. Jayadev S. Schwartz J.K. Horowitz J.M. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1347-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In the Hs27 human diploid fibroblast cell line, the cell-permeable C2-ceramide induced significant dephosphorylation of pRb, with increased association of pRb and the E2F transcription factor into a transcriptionally inactive complex (23Alesse E. Zazzeroni F. Angelucci A. Giannini G. Di Marcotullio L. Gulino A. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition, Lee et al. (22Lee J.Y. Leonhardt L.G. Obeid L.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) showed that endogenous ceramide synthesized de novo during cell cycle progression might function as an endogenous modulator of pRb in WI-38 HDF cells. Moreover, evidence was provided for a role for ceramide-activated protein phosphatase, which comprises both protein phosphatase 1 and protein phosphatase 2A, in the dephosphorylation of pRb. Purified protein phosphatase 1 is known to act on pRb, and ceramide was shown to activate protein phosphatase 1 in vitro, leading to dephosphorylation of pRb (24Chalfant C.E. Kishikawa K. Mumby M.C.

Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21335-21341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Also, in WI-38 HDF, the effects of exogenous ceramide on pRb dephosphorylation were prevented by co-treatment of cells with inhibitors of ceramide-activated protein phosphatase (protein phosphatase 1 and 2A) (26Lee J.Y. Bielawska A.E. Obeid L.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, and at least for exogenous ceramide, a pathway has been defined by which ceramide activates protein phosphatases, leading to dephosphorylation of pRb and to subsequent cell cycle arrest. Differential regulation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) by ceramide provides an additional mechanism of regulating pRb protein phosphorylation and cell cycle progression. Early reports showed that exogenous ceramide resulted in a dose-dependent induction of the p21WAF1 kinase, a major inhibitory protein for CDKs (23Alesse E. Zazzeroni F. Angelucci A. Giannini G. Di Marcotullio L. Gulino A. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 27Deng C. Zhang P. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Leder P.

Cancer Lett. 1998; 129: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Lee et al. showed that in WI-38 HDF cells, exogenous ceramide induced an increase in the levels of p21WAF1, leading to a greater association of p21WAF1 with CDK2, a specific regulator of the G1/S cell cycle check point. In addition, exogenous ceramide was shown to induce selective dephosphorylation of CDK2 and inhibition of its activity (26Lee J.Y. Bielawska A.E. Obeid L.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Supporting these observations, stimulation of Jurkat cells with docosahexaenoic acid induced an increase in ceramide levels and p21WAF1 levels (31Siddiqui R.A. Jenski L.J. Harvey K.A. Wiesehan J.D. Stillwell W. Zaloga G.P. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Additional emerging evidence points to possible roles of N-SMases in cell cycle regulation. For example, in Molt-4 leukemia cells, serum withdrawal caused activation of a N-SMase, significant elevation in ceramide levels, and arrest in cell cycle progression at G0/G1 (10Jayadev S. Liu B. Bielawska A.E. Lee J.Y. Nazaire F. Pushkareva M. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2047-2052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Increases in N-SMase activity and ceramide levels were also observed in WI-38 HDF as they entered the senescent phase (13Venable M.E. Lee J.Y. Smyth M.J. Bielawska A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30701-30708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). An activation of N-SMase by daunorubicin may also be involved in daunorubicin-induced cell cycle arrest and telomerase inhibition (16Ogretmen B. Kraveka J.M. Schady D. Usta J. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32506-32514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). One major limitation in more specific elucidation of the roles of N-SMases in cell regulation has been the absence of molecular tools to study these enzymes. However, recently, two genes, nSMase1 and nSMase2, were identified as candidate N-SMases. nSMase1 was identified by distant homology to bacterial SMases, and nSMase2 was recently identified as a homologue of nSMase1 (33Hofmann K. Tomiuk S. Wolff G. Stoffel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5895-5900Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Whereas careful examination revealed that nSMase1 most likely functions endogenously as a lyso-platelet-activating factor phospholipase C (34Sawai H. Domae N. Nagan N. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38131-38139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), evidence was provided that nSMase2 indeed can function as a sphingomyelinase in cells. Overexpression of nSMase2 caused an increase in the levels of ceramide and a decrease in the levels of sphingomyelin (35Marchesini N. Luberto C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13775-13783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In that study, it was also noted that overexpressing nSMase2 in MCF7 cells resulted in a significant decrease in cell growth (30%) as the cells reached the plateau/confluence phase (35Marchesini N. Luberto C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13775-13783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Interestingly, an independent line of investigation had also suggested a possible role of nSMase2 in cell contact inhibition. In that study, nSMase2 was identified as a confluent 3Y1 cell-associated gene (cca1) in 3Y1 cells, whose mRNA levels were increased in growth-arrested confluent 3Y1 rat cells (36Hayashi Y. Kiyono T. Fujita M. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18082-18086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In light of these results, we here investigate the hypothesis that nSMase2 functions as an endogenous regulator of cell growth. Therefore, the goals of this study were to determine the regulation and physiological role of nSMase2 during cell growth and to determine candidate downstream targets for nSMase2. The results demonstrate that endogenous nSMase2 levels are induced upon confluence and that down-regulation of nSMase2 prevents confluence-induced cell cycle arrest. Interestingly, nSMase2 seems to differentially regulate the levels of long chain (C16:0) and very long chain (C24:1 and C24:0) ceramides. The possible mechanisms involved in nSMase2-induced cell cycle arrest during cell confluence are discussed. Materials—[choline-methyl-14C]Sphingomyelin was provided by Dr. Alicja Bielawska (Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC). All lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Scintillation mixture Safety Solve was from Research Products International. Other chemicals were from Sigma. Anti-mouse and antirabbit TRITC secondary antibody was from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Oligodeoxynucleotides were purchased from IDT, Inc. Culture mediums were obtained from Invitrogen. Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—MCF7 cells transfected with vector alone (MCF7/vector) and those transfected with nSMase2 (MCF7/nSMase2) were maintained in RPMI 1640 and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cell line was maintained in minimal essential medium containing 10% FBS. Young WI-38 HDF (NIA Aging Cell Repository catalog no. AG06814E) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4.5 g/liter glucose and 10% FBS. In experiments investigating the effects of growth arrest, cells were grown under conditions that achieved growth arrest by allowing cells to reach confluence. Thus, cells were plated at a density of 0.4–0.6 × 106 cells in a 100-mm plate to be used the day after for the experiments. Subconfluent growing cells were designated day 2 cells. Confluent arrested cells were collected on the day of confluence or 2 days postconfluence and were designated day 4 and day 6 cells, respectively. Fresh medium was supplemented every 2 days, and cells were removed from the plates by trypsinization. Phase of growth was estimated by counting cells using a hemocytometer as described (35Marchesini N. Luberto C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13775-13783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and by flow cytometric analysis. RNA Interference Transfection—Synthetic sense and antisense oligonucleotides were purchased from Qiagen (Lafayette, CO). For design of short interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides targeting nSMase2, a DNA sequence of the type AA (N19) was selected for the human (AAt-gctactggctggtggacc) and mouse nSMase2 (AAtgttactggctggtggacc). This sequence corresponded to nucleotides 78–96 located 3′ to the first nucleotide of the start codon of the human and mouse nSMase2 cDNA. The DNA sequence was submitted to a BLAST search against the human genome sequence to ensure that only the nSMase2 gene was targeted. A nonspecific siRNA was used as control. Gene silencing of nSMase2 was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Xeragon) and as described (37Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8186) Google Scholar). Briefly, the corresponding single-stranded sense and antisense siRNA oligonucleotides (20 μm) were annealed by incubation in annealing buffer (100 mm potassium acetate, 30 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), and 2 mm magnesium acetate for 1 min at 90 °C, followed by 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were plated in 100-mm dishes at a density of 0.4 × 106 MCF7 cells/dish to be used the subsequent day for gene silencing experiments. Transfections were done using OligofectAMINE (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. Cells were supplemented with a fresh medium each 2 days, and the final siRNA concentration was 166 nm. At the indicated time points after transfection, cells were used for flow cytrometric analysis, N-SMase activity assays, ceramide measurements, and immunoblotting analysis. Preparation of Cell Lysates—Cells were lysed by syringe passage in buffer containing 25 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml each chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin A, and post-nuclear lysate (800 × g for 5 min) was used to measure N-SMase activity. N-SMase Activity—Proteins (100 μg) from wild type MCF7 cells or nSMase2 overexpressors (10 μg) were added to 100 μl of reaction mixture containing 100 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2% Triton X-100, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μm [choline-methyl-14C]sphingomyelin (10 cpm/pmol) and phosphatidylserine (6.7 mol %). The final volume was adjusted to 200 μl with 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4). After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 1.5 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1), the phases were separated by the addition of 200 μl of water, and 400 μl of the upper phase was mixed with 4 ml of Safety Solve (Research Products International) for liquid scintillation counting. Real Time RT-PCR—mRNA from MCF7 cells was isolated using the Qiagen minikit for mRNA extraction. Complementary DNA was synthesized from 5 μg of total RNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI) and oligo(dT)12–16. Real time RT-PCR was performed on a PE Biosystems Gene Ampt 5700 Sequence Detection System (Foster City, CA). All reaction components were purchased from PE Biosystems. Standard reaction volume was 10 μl and contained 1× SYBR RT-PCR buffer; 3 mm MgCl2; 0.2 mm each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP; 0.4 mm dUTP; 0.005 units of AmpliTaq Gold; 0.002 units of AmpErase UNG erase enzyme; 0.35 liters of cDNA template; and 50–900 nm oligonucleotide primer. Initial steps of RT-PCR were 2 min at 50 °C for UNG erase activation, followed by a 10-min hold at 95 °C. Cycles (n = 40) consisted of a 15-s melt at 95 °C, followed by a 1-min annealing/extension at 60 °C. The final step was a 60 °C incubation for 1 min. All reactions were performed in triplicate. Threshold for cycle of threshold (Ct) analysis of all samples was set at 0.15 relative fluorescence units. The data were normalized to an internal control gene, β-actin, to control for RNA preparation. Data Analysis—Real time RT-PCR results were analyzed using Q-Gene® software (38Muller P.Y. Janovjak H. Miserez A.R. Dobbie Z. BioTechniques. 2002; 32 (1376, 1378–1379): 1372-1374PubMed Google Scholar), which expresses data as mean normalized expression. Mean normalized expression is directly proportional to the amount of RNA of the target gene (nSMase2) relative to the amount of RNA of the reference gene (β-actin). Primer Design—Primers for β-actin and nSMase2 were designed using the PerkinElmer Primer Express® software. These primers were made to be intron-spanning to preclude amplification of genomic DNA. Primer sequences were as follows: β-actin (forward, 5′-ATTGGCAATGAGCGGTTCC-3′; reverse, 5′-GGTAGTTTCGTGGATGCCACA-3′), nSMase2 (forward, 5′-CAACAAGTGTAACGACGATGCC-3′; reverse, 5′-CGATTCTTTGGTCCTGAGGTGT-3′. Cell Cycle Synchronization—Exponentially growing MCF7/control and MCF7/nSMase2 cells were arrested in G0/G1 phase by incubation in 0.1% (v/v) FBS-supplemented RPMI 1640 for 72 h. To release the cells from the G0/G1 block, cells were washed with PBS and incubated in 10% FBS RPMI 1640. Analysis of Cell Cycle Profiles by Flow Cytometry—At the given time points, a control and treated sample were partially treated with trypsin and centrifuged. The cell pellet was washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then fixed in 3 ml of 70% ethanol, all at 4 °C. On the day of analysis, cells were washed with PBS and treated with 20 μg/ml DNase-free RNase A at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were then stained with 100 μg/ml propidium iodide for 30 min and analyzed with a FACStarplus flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Analysis of Ceramide and Sphingomyelin Molecular Species—Electrospray ionization/MS/MS analysis of ceramides was performed on a Thermo Finnigan TSQ 7000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, operating in a multiple reaction monitoring positive ionization mode. Total cells, fortified with internal standards, were extracted with ethyl acetate/isopropyl alcohol/water (60:30:10, v/v/v), evaporated to dryness, and reconstituted in 100 μl of methanol. The samples were injected on the Surveyor/TSQ 7000 liquid chromatography/MS system and gradient-eluted from the BDS Hypersil C8, 150 × 3.2-mm, 3-μm particle size column, with a 1.0 mm methanolic ammonium formate, 2 mm aqueous ammonium formate mobile phase system. The peaks for the target analytes and internal standards were collected and processed using the Xcalibur software system. Calibration curves were constructed by plotting peak area ratios of synthetic standards, representing each target analyte to the corresponding internal standard. The target analyte peak area ratios from the samples were similarly normalized to their respective internal standard and compared with the calibration curves using a linear regression model. Immunoblotting—Cells were resuspended in 100 μl lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris (pH 7.4); 5 mm EDTA; 50 mm NaF; 2 mm sodium orthovanadate; 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; and 2 μg/ml each chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin A. Homogenate (2 μl) was used for protein estimation, using a Bio-Rad protein assay reagent, and 100 μl of homogenate was mixed with 100 μlof2× Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) and boiled for 4 min. Rb detection was performed as previously described (21Dbaibo G. Pushkareva M.Y. Jayadev S. Schwartz J.K. Horowitz J.M. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1347-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Briefly, blots were incubated with PGM 245 mouse IgG1 anti-human Rb antibodies (Pharmingen) in 5% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in TBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. After washing, blots were incubated with anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1:4000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h. PARP and p21 protein levels were detected using 1 μg/ml rabbit polyclonal anti-PARP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-p21WAF1 (Oncogene; Research Biotechnology) antibodies in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma). After overnight incubation, blots were washed, and proteins were visualized using peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit antibody (1:2500) as described (39Sawai H. Okazaki T. Takeda Y.

FLAG-tagged nSMase2 was detected as described (35Marchesini N. Luberto C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13775-13783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Equal loading was verified by using anti-β-actin and γ-tubulin antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The signal was visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences) with exposure to Biomax MR film. nSMase2 Constructs—The mouse nSMase2 3′FLAG tag was generated by PCR (forward primer, 5′-GGGTACCATGGTTTTGTACACGACCCCCTTTCCT-3′; reverse primer containing the sequence for the FLAG tag, 5′-TCCGCTCGAGCTACTTATCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCCGCCTCCTCTTCCCCTGCAGACAC-3′). For the nSMase2 3′GFP tag, mouse cDNA was amplified with PCR, and gene-specific primers with XhoI and KpnI restriction sites. Plasmids, pcDNA3.1 or pEGFP-N1 (Clontech), and the PCR products were digested with the restriction enzymes XhoI and KpnI and ligated. The amplified products digested and ligated into vectors were sequenced at the Medical Univer"

This hypothesis raised the question of whether activity of these proteins is regulated to maintain zinc homeostasis. Neither mZIP1 nor mZIP3 mRNA levels are highly regulated by zinc status. Therefore, we investigated whether zinc controls the activity of these proteins post-translationally by altering their subcellular distribution. When expressed in transfected cells grown in zinc-replete medium, both mZip1 and mZip3 were largely present in intracellular organelles. However, these proteins were found to rapidly transit between the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments in zinc-replete cells. Zinc deficiency increased plasma membrane levels of mZip1 and mZip3 by decreasing their rates of endocytosis. Greater zinc deficiency was required to alter mZip3 distribution than was needed to affect mZip1. Increased surface levels correlated with increased zinc uptake activity. Taken together, these results suggest that post-translational control of mZip1 and mZip3 localization plays a role in zinc homeostasis. Moreover, our results indicate that zinc-responsive endocytosis is a conserved mechanism controlling activity of many mammalian zinc uptake transporters.

Zinc is an essential nutrient because of the many important roles it plays in biology. Therefore, cells require efficient uptake mechanisms to obtain zinc from their extracellular environment. Zinc is also potentially toxic if overaccumulated so homeostatic regulatory mechanisms are required to control the activity of zinc uptake systems and prevent zinc overaccumulation. Zinc uptake is mediated in many organisms by members of the ZIP 1The abbreviations used are: ZIP, Zrt-, Irt-like protein; HA, hemagglutinin antigen; MCD, methyl β-cyclodextrin; TPEN, N,N,N′N′-tetrakis(2-pyridyl-methyl)ethylenediamine; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HEK, human embryonic kidney.

Gaymard F. Guerinot M.L. Briat J.F. Curie C. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1223-1233Google Scholar). Members of the ZIP family show considerable diversity and cluster into four distinct subfamilies based on their amino acid sequence similarities (2Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. Biometals. 2001; 14: 251-270Google Scholar). The human genome encodes 14 ZIP proteins and their corresponding genes are designated SLC39A1-SLC39A14 (12Eide D.J. Pflugers Arch. 2003; Google Scholar). The importance of mammalian ZIP proteins in zinc acquisition is becoming increasingly clear. For example, SLC39A4 encodes the hZip4 protein recently implicated in the uptake of zinc from the diet; SLC39A4 is mutated in patients with the heritable disease acrodermatitis enteropathica (AE) (13Kury S. Dreno B. Bezieau S. Giraudet S. Kharfi M. Kamoun R. Moisan J.P. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 239-240Google Scholar, 14Wang K. Zhou B. Kuo Y.M. Zemansky J. Gitschier J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 71: 66-73Google Scholar). If untreated, AE patients become zinc-deficient because of a decreased ability to utilize dietary zinc. More recent studies have indicated that the orthologous mouse protein mZip4 is responsible for dietary zinc uptake by intestinal enterocytes (15Dufner-Beattie J. Wang F. Kuo Y. Gitschier J. Eide D. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33474-33481Google Scholar, 16Wang F. Kim B. Dufner-Beattie J. Andrews G. Petris M. Eide D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 563-571Google Scholar). hZip4 and mZip4 are members of the so-called LIV-1 sub-family of ZIP proteins (2Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. Biometals. 2001; 14: 251-270Google Scholar, 4Taylor K.M. Nicholson R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1611: 16-30Google Scholar). Among the other mammalian ZIP-encoding genes are SLC39A1 and SLC39A3, encoding hZip1 and hZip3, and the orthologous mouse genes. These proteins belong to a different ZIP subfamily and share only limited sequence similarity to mammalian Zip4. Nonetheless, human and mouse Zip1 proteins have been shown to be active for zinc uptake and specific for zinc as their substrate (17Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5560-5564Google Scholar, 18Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22258-22264Google Scholar, 19Dufner-Beattie J. Langmade S.J. Wang F. Eide D. Andrews G.K. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 50142-50150Google Scholar) although activity of the human protein has not yet been examined. ZIP1 is abundantly expressed in a wide variety of tissues (18Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22258-22264Google Scholar, 19Dufner-Beattie J. Langmade S.J. Wang F. Eide D. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50142-50150Google Scholar, 20Lioumi M. Ferguson C.A. Sharpe P.T. Freeman T. Marenholz I. Mischke D. Heizmann C. Ragoussis J. Genomics. 1999; 62: 272-280Google Scholar). ZIP3 is also widely expressed in many tissue types (Unigene EST data base) 2www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=unigene. although it is most abundant in testes (19Dufner-Beattie J. Langmade S.J. Wang F. Eide D. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50142-50150Google Scholar). These results suggest that Zip1 and Zip3 are involved in zinc acquisition by many cells of the body. Regulation of ZIP protein activity has been found to occur at both transcriptional and post-translational levels. In yeast, transcription of the ZRT1 and ZRT2 genes is induced by zinc limitation thereby increasing the activity of these transporters by as much as 80-fold (6Zhao H. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23203-23210Google Scholar, 7Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Google Scholar). In addition to this transcriptional control, Zrt1 activity is regulated post-translationally. When zinc is resupplied to zinc-deficient cells expressing high levels of Zrt1, the transporter is rapidly inactivated (21Gitan R.S. Luo H. Rodgers J. Broderius M. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28617-28624Google Scholar). This inactivation occurs because zinc stimulates the rate of endocytosis of the transporter and its removal from the plasma membrane. In mammals, regulation of some zinc uptake transporters occurs at the level of mRNA abundance possibly via transcriptional control. For example, SLC39A2 (hZIP2) mRNA levels rise almost 30-fold in cultured THP-1 monocytes made zinc-deficient by treatment with TPEN, a membrane-permeable zinc chelator (22Cousins R.J. Blanchard R.K. Popp M.P. Liu L. Cao J. Moore J.B. Green C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6952-6957Google Scholar). Similarly, mice fed a zinc-deficient diet accumulate ∼10-fold more mZIP4 mRNA in intestinal enterocytes than is found in zinc-replete animals (15Dufner-Beattie J. Wang F. Kuo Y. Gitschier J. Eide D. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33474-33481Google Scholar). We have recently found that mZip4 activity is regulated at a post-translational level as well. As was the case for yeast Zrt1, zinc stimulates endocytosis of the mouse and human Zip4 protein (23Kim B.E. Wang F. Dufner-Beattie J. Andrews G.K. Eide D.J. Petris M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 4523-4530Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that regulation at the level of mRNA abundance combined with post-translational control regulate the influx of dietary zinc via Zip4. In contrast to ZIP2 and ZIP4, expression of mammalian ZIP1 and ZIP3 is not highly regulated at the transcript level (19Dufner-Beattie J. Langmade S.J. Wang F. Eide D. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50142-50150Google Scholar, 22Cousins R.J. Blanchard R.K. Popp M.P. Liu L. Cao J. Moore J.B. Green C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6952-6957Google Scholar, 24Costello L.C. Liu Y. Zou J. Franklin R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17499-17504Google Scholar, 25Kelleher S.L. Lonnerdal B. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 3378-3385Google Scholar). This observation raised the question of how cells expressing these transporters regulate zinc uptake. To address this question, we examined whether mouse Zip1 and Zip3 are regulated post-translationally by controlling their localization in the cell. In this study, we show that the intracellular distribution of these proteins is regulated by zinc at least in part by controlling their rate of endocytosis. These studies suggest that post-translational control of zinc transporter localization plays a major role in zinc homeostasis in a wide range of cell types. Moreover, given the divergence of mammalian ZIP transporters now known to be regulated in this fashion, post-translational control of the zinc uptake transporter localization appears to be a general mechanism of zinc homeostasis in mammals. Plasmid Constructions—These studies used alleles of mZip1, mZip3, and mZip4 that were tagged at their C termini with one copy of the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen epitope. Construction of these plasmids is described elsewhere (15Dufner-Beattie J. Wang F. Kuo Y. Gitschier J. Eide D. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33474-33481Google Scholar, 19Dufner-Beattie J. Langmade S.J. Wang F. Eide D. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50142-50150Google Scholar). Each protein was expressed from the cytomegalovirus promoter and shown previously to be functional for zinc transport (15Dufner-Beattie J. Wang F. Kuo Y. Gitschier J. Eide D. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33474-33481Google Scholar, 19Dufner-Beattie J. Langmade S.J. Wang F. Eide D. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50142-50150Google Scholar, 23Kim B.E. Wang F. Dufner-Beattie J. Andrews G.K. Eide D.J. Petris M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 4523-4530Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection Methods—Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) plus 0.45% glucose under 5% CO2. All culture media contained 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine, and 100 μm minimal essential medium non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). HEK293 (∼2 × 106) cells were seeded in 25-mm2 flasks and transfected with plasmid DNAs using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Stably transfected HEK293 cell lines were selected with 2.0 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) 48 h after transfection. Approximately 80% of cells in each population expressed the transgene as shown by immunofluorescence microscopy (data not shown). 65Zn Uptake Assays—Stably transfected HEK293 cells were used for 65Zn uptake assays as described previously (15Dufner-Beattie J. Wang F. Kuo Y. Gitschier J. Eide D. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33474-33481Google Scholar). Cells were washed once in uptake buffer (15 mm HEPES, 100 mm glucose, and 150 mm KCl, pH 7.0) and then added to prewarmed uptake buffer containing the specified concentration of 65ZnCl2 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and incubated in a shaking 37 °C water bath for 15 min. Assays were stopped by adding an equal volume of ice-cold uptake buffer supplemented with 1 mm EDTA (stop buffer). Cells were then collected on nitrocellulose filters (Millipore, 0.45-μm pore size) and washed three times in stop buffer (∼10 ml of total wash volume). Parallel experiments were conducted at 0 °C to estimate cell surface 65Zn binding, which was subtracted from the values at 37 °C to obtain net zinc uptake values. Cell-associated radioactivity was measured with a Packard Auto-Gamma 5650 γ-counter. In a parallel experiment, cells were washed three times with ice-cold uptake buffer and then lysed in PBS buffer plus 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100. Protein levels were then determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay. Zinc accumulation was calculated and normalized to protein concentrations of cell lysates. Immunoblotting—Transfected cells were harvested, washed three times with ice-cold PBS, scraped into PBS, and collected by centrifugation. After three additional washes in ice-cold PBS, the cells were lysed by sonication in buffer containing 62 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Loading buffer was added to the protein extracts and then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. (Higher incubation temperatures were found to cause aggregation of these proteins.) Extract volumes equivalent to 20-μg protein extracts were separated using a 4-20% gradient SDS-PAGE Ready Gels (Bio-Rad), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed using an anti-HA polyclonal antibody (1:1000, Sigma) followed by an anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP, Pierce). As a loading control, the membranes were stripped of antibodies by incubating at 60 °C for 30 min in stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 2% (w/v) SDS), washed in TBST, and reprobed with a 1:40,000 dilution of mouse anti-tubulin (Sigma) primary antibody and 1:10,000 dilution of HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Pierce) as secondary antibody. For immunoblot analysis of mZip-HA surface levels, the cells were cultured in 6-well trays. In some experiments, ZnCl2 or N,N,N′N′-tetrakis (2-pyridyl-methyl) ethylenediamine (TPEN) was added to the medium at the indicated concentrations and times. Cells were washed three times with PBS on ice, fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C, blocked, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 1:500 primary rabbit anti-HA antibody (Sigma), and then washed five times with PBS to remove unbound antibodies. The cells were then lysed by sonication in SDS buffer solution containing 62 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Lysates containing the solubilized anti-HA antibodies that were bound to the mZip-HA protein at the plasma membrane were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and the anti-HA antibodies were then detected using anti-rabbit HRP antibodies (1:10,000) by chemiluminescence (Roche Applied Science). The protein detected in the mZip-HA lanes co-migrated with purified anti-HA antibody (data not shown). Endocytosis of mZip-HA proteins was determined by assaying the uptake of anti-HA antibodies added to the culture media of live cells. Cells were grown on 6-well plates in basal medium or in basal medium supplemented for 1 h with 10 μm zinc and/or 10 μm TPEN. The cells were chilled on ice for 10 min and then rewarmed and incubated in basal, zinc-, or TPEN-supplemented medium containing 5 μg/ml anti-HA antibodies for 5 min. During this time, antibodies bound to the HA epitope were internalized by endocytosis. Cells were transferred to ice to prevent further endocytosis, washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and surface-bound antibodies were removed by five washes with ice-cold acidic buffer (100 mm glycine, 20 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm potassium chloride, pH 2.2). This treatment is sufficient to remove all detectable surface-bound antibodies (16Wang F. Kim B. Dufner-Beattie J. Andrews G. Petris M. Eide D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 563-571Google Scholar, 23Kim B.E. Wang F. Dufner-Beattie J. Andrews G.K. Eide D.J. Petris M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 4523-4530Google Scholar). After two additional washes with ice-cold PBS, the cells were collected, lysed, and analyzed for anti-HA antibodies by immunoblotting as described above. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—To assay the surface levels of mZip-HA proteins, cells were grown in 24-well plates for 48 h on sterile glass coverslips. In some experiments, ZnCl2 or TPEN was added to the medium at the indicated concentrations and times. The cells were then washed three times with ice-cold PBS, fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C, and washed three times with PBS. Cells were blocked for 1 h with PBS plus 5% normal goat serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) and 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C with a 1:500 dilution of primary rabbit anti-HA antibody (Sigma). The cells were then washed five times in PBS followed by incubation for 1 h with the anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes). The cells were washed again with PBS and then examined with an Olympus 1X70 microscope fitted with a Bio-Rad MRC-600 confocal laser. The intracellular distribution of mZip-HA proteins was examined in a similar manner using cells that were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Permeabilized cells were incubated with 2 μg/ml DNase-free RNase (Roche Applied Science) at 37 °C for 30 min prior to antibody addition. Mouse anti-p230 was used as a marker of the trans-Golgi network (BD Biosciences). Detection of p230 was performed using an anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated to Alexa 594. Expression and Subcellular Distribution of mZip1-HA and mZip3-HA Proteins in Transfected HEK293 Cells—Previous studies established that the mouse Zip1 and Zip3 proteins stimulate zinc uptake when expressed at high levels in transiently transfected HEK293 cells. To allow assessment of the subcellular distribution of these proteins, a hemagglutinin antigen (HA) epitope tag was fused to their C termini for detection of the mZip1-HA and mZip3-HA proteins. The tagged proteins were shown previously to be functional for 65Zn uptake (19Dufner-Beattie J. Langmade S.J. Wang F. Eide D. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50142-50150Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were transfected with mZip1-HA and mZip3-HA plasmids expressing the gene from the cytomegalovirus promoter. Populations of cells stably expressing mZip1-HA or mZip3-HA were obtained following selection with puromycin and designated as HEK/mZip1-HA or HEK/mZip3-HA cell lines. In each population, ∼80% of the cells expressed the HA-tagged protein as determined by immunofluorescence microscopy (data not shown). Immunoblot analysis using an anti-HA antibody detected a single protein of ∼35 kDa molecular mass in both transfected cell populations consistent with the predicted molecular masses of mZip1-HA and mZip3-HA (35.2 and 34.9 kDa, respectively) (Fig. 1A). No bands were detected in HEK293 cells transfected with the pcDNA3.1 vector alone. As a control for these and subsequent experiments, we also included a cell line stably expressing mZip4-HA. This cell line accumulated mZip4 protein to similar levels as observed in the HEK/mZip1-HA and HEK/mZip3-HA lines. We showed previously that mZip4-HA is N-glycosylated; inhibition of N-glycosylation in vivo or enzymatic removal of N-glycosyl groups in vitro reduced the apparent molecular mass of mZip4-HA (16Wang F. Kim B. Dufner-Beattie J. Andrews G. Petris M. Eide D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 563-571Google Scholar). Similar treatments had no effect on mZip1-HA and mZip3-HA mobility indicating that these proteins are not glycosylated (data not shown). The subcellular distribution of mZip1-HA, mZip3-HA, and mZip4-HA was assessed by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. Cells were grown in a zinc-replete basal medium and then fixed, permeabilized, incubated with anti-HA antibody, and subsequently incubated with a fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody. No significant fluorescence was observed in vector-only transfectants (data not shown). Cells expressing mZip1-HA, mZip3-HA, and mZip4-HA showed abundant staining (Fig. 1B). A large proportion of each protein was distributed in intracellular vesicles scattered throughout the cytoplasm. These vesicles were especially concentrated in the perinuclear region, which co-localized with a marker protein, p230, of the trans-Golgi network (Fig. 1B, red). The merged images are shown in the right hand panel of Fig. 1B, and the overlap of mZip-HA (green) and p230 (red) is shown in yellow. Similar results were obtained when these proteins were expressed in CHO cells (data not shown). To assess surface levels of these proteins in cells grown in basal medium, immunofluorescence studies were performed using cells that were fixed but not permeabilized. The C-terminal epitope tag of each protein is predicted to be extracellular and therefore exposed to antibody binding in non-permeabilized cells. No fluorescence was detected following surface labeling of vector-only transfectants (Fig. 2A). In contrast, fluorescence staining was clearly observed on the surface of mZip1-HA and mZip3-HA cells grown in basal medium. The punctate nature of this staining suggested that these proteins localize to lipid rafts or other discrete microdomains of the plasma membrane as has been found for other surface proteins (26Nabi I.R. Le P.U. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 673-677Google Scholar). Notably, despite similar levels of total protein accumulation (Fig. 1A), surface levels of mZip4-HA protein appeared to be much higher than either mZip1-HA or mZip3-HA. As an alternative approach to assess surface levels, we used an immunoblotting technique used previously to assay surface levels of mZip4 (16Wang F. Kim B. Dufner-Beattie J. Andrews G. Petris M. Eide D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 563-571Google Scholar, 23Kim B.E. Wang F. Dufner-Beattie J. Andrews G.K. Eide D.J. Petris M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 4523-4530Google Scholar). This method uses immunoblots to assess the levels of anti-HA antibodies bound to the surface of non-permeabilized HEK/mZip-HA cells. Cells were grown in basal medium, fixed with paraformaldehyde, and the intact cells were then probed with anti-HA antibodies to label mZip-HA proteins on the cell surface. After extensive washing to remove unbound antibodies, the cells were lysed, and the anti-HA antibodies that had been bound to the cell surface were detected by immunoblotting. The results of this experiment indicated that surface levels of mZip4-HA are significantly higher than mZip1-HA or mZip3-HA (Fig. 2B). The absence of detectable surface antibody binding by vector-only transfectants indicated that nonspecific antibody binding was not occurring. mZip1-HA and mZip3-HA Transit between the Plasma Membrane and Endocytic Compartments—We previously showed that mZip4-HA transits between the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments in cells grown in basal medium. To determine if mZip1-HA and mZip3-HA also cycle via the plasma membrane, we first examined the effects of the general endocytosis inhibitor, methyl β-cyclodextrin (MCD; 5 mm) (27Rodal S.K. Skretting G. Garred O. Vilhardt F. van Deurs B. Sandvig K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 961-974Google Scholar). MCD inhibits both clathrin-dependent and caveolae-dependent endocytosis by extracting cholesterol from the plasma membrane. If mZip1-HA and mZip3-HA cycled via the plasma membrane, we predicted that MCD treatment would increase the level of protein accumulated on the cell surface. The effects of MCD on the distribution of total mZip-HA protein in permeabilized cells is shown in Fig. 3A. For each protein, MCD treatment for 1 h resulted in an apparent migration from the trans-Golgi network region to more dispersed cytoplasmic vesicles. Furthermore, an increase in fluorescence observed at the cell periphery suggested increased surface levels of each protein. This conclusion was confirmed when we examined the effects of MCD treatment on surface mZip-HA levels in non-permeabilized cells (Fig. 3B). Increased surface levels upon MCD treatment were also found when surface levels were examined by immunoblotting of surface-bound anti-HA antibody as was described in Fig. 2B. Moreover, these studies indicated that the change in surface levels occurs very rapidly. Surface levels of mZip1-HA and mZip4-HA increased to near or fully maximal levels after only 2 min of MCD treatment (Fig. 3C). Increased surface mZip3-HA levels were also detectable after 2-5 min of treatment but only reached maximum levels after 20 min of MCD treatment. Nonetheless, these results suggest that mZip1 and mZip3, like mZip4, rapidly cycle between the plasma membrane and endocytic compartments. The slower response of mZip3-HA to MCD suggests that this protein may transit more slowly than do mZip1-HA and mZip4-HA. It should be noted that the immunoblots for mZip1-HA and mZip3-HA are much longer exposures than the mZip4-HA blot shown to compensate for their lower surface levels (Fig. 2). Treating cells with other inhibitors of endocytosis, i.e. sucrose, chlorpromazine, K+ depletion, resulted in similar increases in mZip1-HA and mZip3-HA surface accumulation suggesting that the effects observed with MCD are not due to perturbations of cellular processes other than endocytosis (data not shown). The extracellular location of the HA epitope at the C terminus of each Zip protein also allowed us to examine this cycling by assaying internalization of anti-HA antibodies from the growth medium by living cells. We found previously that when mZip4-HA undergoes endocytosis from the plasma membrane, anti-HA antibodies added to the medium can bind to surface mZip4-HA and be internalized. Thus, endocytosis of the protein correlates with the amount of anti-HA antibody internalized. We used this same method to assess endocytosis of mZip1-HA and mZip3-HA. HEK/mZip-HA cells were exposed for 5-30 min to medium containing anti-HA antibodies, chilled to stop further endocytosis, and then surface-bound antibodies were removed by washing with cold acidic buffer. This treatment was shown to be sufficient to remove all surface-bound antibodies (Fig. 4, lane 1 versus 2). The cells were then lysed and analyzed by immunoblotting to detect internalized anti-HA antibodies. No internalized antibodies were detected for vector-only transfectants even after 30 min of antibody treatment (Fig. 4, lane 3). In contrast, mZip1-HA, mZip3-HA, and mZip4-HA cells accumulated antibody over the 30-min time period (Fig. 4, lanes 4-6). These results supported our conclusion that despite their largely intracellular steady state distribution, mZip1-HA and mZip3-HA cycle rapidly to and from the plasma membrane. mZip1-HA and mZip3-HA Distribution Is Altered by Zinc Status—Our previous studies of yeast Zrt1 and mammalian Zip4 demonstrated that zinc status controls the subcellular distribution of these proteins. In low zinc, Zrt1 and Zip4 accumulate on the cell surface to mediate zinc uptake. In high zinc, the protein is removed from the cell surface and uptake activity decreases. To assess the effects of zinc deficiency on mZip1-HA and mZip3-HA, we first examined surface levels of these proteins by immunofluorescence microscopy of non-permeabilized cells. As shown previously, 1 h of incubation in medium pretreated with Chelex 100 to remove labile zinc resulted in increased mZip4-HA surface levels (Fig. 5A). Similarly, surface detection of mZip1-HA also increased following exposure to zinc-deficient Chelex-treated medium. Consistent with these results, causing zinc deficiency by treating HEK/mZip1-HA and HEK/mZip4-HA cells with TPEN also resulted in increased surface levels. This effect was blocked by simultaneous incubation with TPEN plus equimolar levels of zinc. In contrast, incubation of mZip3-HA in Chelex-treated medium did not alter surface levels whereas incubation with TPEN increased surface levels dramatically. These results suggested that the distribution of mZip3-HA is also zinc responsive but may require greater zinc limitation, as is afforded by TPEN treatment, to occur. Experiments described later in this report supported this hypothesis. Immunoblots of total protein extracts from these various cell lines, and treatment conditions indicated no changes in protein levels had occurred (Fig. 5B). Therefore, the changes in distribution observed are not due to effects on protein abundance. Zinc-responsive protein trafficking was further supported by complementary experiments assessing the level of surface mZip-HA proteins by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 6A, incubation of HEK/mZip1-HA and HEK/mZip4-HA in Chelex-treated medium resulted in increased surface levels of these two proteins. While surface levels of mZip4-HA rapidly increased over 5 min and reached its new steady state abundance within 15 min, no detectable increase in mZip1-HA surface levels was apparent until after 15 min. Consistent with the immunofluorescence microscopy result in Fig. 5A, surface levels of mZip3-HA remained constant for 60 min (Fig. 6A) and for 24 h (data not shown) incubation in Chelex-treated medium. As shown in Fig. 6B, surface levels of all three proteins increased in response to TPEN treatment. Again, mZip4-HA responded quickly, i.e. within 5 min, whereas mZip1-HA and mZip3-HA responded more slowly. Surface accumulation of mZip1-HA, mZip3-HA, and mZip4-HA was blocked by incubation in TPEN + equimolar zinc. The failure of mZip3-HA to respond to Chelex-treated medium suggested that this protein required greater zinc limitation than did mZip1-HA or mZip4-HA. This hypothesis was supported when we examined surface mZip-HA levels in cells treated over a range of TPEN concentrations. HEK/mZip1-HA, HEK/mZip3-HA, and HEK/mZip4-HA cells were treated with 0-20 μm TPEN for 60 min, and surface levels were then assayed by immunoblotting. As little as 1 μm TPEN was sufficient to trigger mZip1-HA and mZip4-HA surface accumulation whereas 5-10 μm TPEN was required to increase surface levels of mZip3-HA (Fig. 7A). Similarly, when cells were treated with medium in which increasing zinc concentrations were added to a fixed concentration of TPEN (10 μm), more zinc was required to prevent increased surface accumulation of mZip1-HA and mZip4-HA than was required for mZip3-HA (Fig. 7B). These results suggest that mZip3-HA relocalization responds only to severe zinc deficiency whereas mZip1-HA and mZip4-HA require only moderately limiting conditions. As was found previously for mZip4 (23Kim B.E. Wang F. Dufner-Beattie J. Andrews G.K. Eide D.J. Petris M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 4523-4530Google Scholar), increased surface levels of mZip1-HA and mZip3-HA under zinc deficiency could be the result of decreased rates of endocytosis. To test this hypothesis, we examined antibody internalization in zinc-replete and deficient cells as described in Fig. 4. HEK293 cells expressing mZip1-HA, mZip3-HA, or mZip4-HA were incubated for one h in basal medium, basal plus 10 μm TPEN, or basal plus 10 μm TPEN and 10 μm ZnCl2. Anti-HA antibodies were then added to the growth medium and the cells were allowed to internalize these antibodies for 10 min. The cells were then chilled, stripped of surface-bound antibodies, and assayed for internalized antibodies by immunoblotting. No antibody internalization was detected in vector-only cells (Fig. 8). For mZip1-HA, mZip3-HA, and mZip4-HA, antibody internalization was higher in untreated cells relative to cells exposed to the endocytosis inhibitor MCD. Similarly, TPEN treatment also reduced the rate of internalization whereas TPEN + zinc treatment had no effect. These results indicate that like mZip4 (23Kim B.E. Wang F. Dufner-Beattie J. Andrews G.K. Eide D.J. Petris M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 4523-4530Google Scholar), the endocytosis rate of mZip1-HA and mZip3-HA decreases under zinc deficiency and explains, at least in part, the increase in surface levels under these conditions. Accumulation of mZip1-HA and mZip3-HA on the Cell Surface Increases Zinc Uptake Activity—The zinc-responsive accumulation of mZip1-HA and mZip3-HA on the cell surface may be a homeostatic mechanism to control zinc uptake activity in response to zinc status/availability as was found previously for mZip4 (23Kim B.E. Wang F. Dufner-Beattie J. Andrews G.K. Eide D.J. Petris M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 4523-4530Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, HEK/mZip1-HA and HEK/mZip3-HA cells were pretreated (1 h) in either basal medium, zinc-deficient medium (basal + TPEN), or zinc-deficient medium supplemented with zinc (basal + TPEN + Zn), washed, and then assayed for zinc uptake activity over 5 min in buffer containing 65Zn. These treatments had no effect on the uptake activity of vector-only HEK293 transfectants (Fig. 9). Zinc uptake activity was markedly increased by pretreating the cells expressing the mZip-HA proteins with TPEN. Adding zinc back to the TPEN-treated cells suppressed this increase in zinc uptake activity. Consistent with the results of incubating cells in Chelex-treated medium on surface levels of mZip1-HA and mZip3-HA (Figs. 5 and 6), 65Zn uptake activity of mZip1-HA-expressing cells increased following this treatment, whereas no such increase was observed with mZip3-HA-expressing cells. These data support the hypothesis that the increased levels of mZip-HA proteins at the cell surface in zinc-deficient conditions is likely to be a homeostatic mechanism to stimulate zinc uptake activity. Regulating zinc uptake transporter activity is an important aspect of zinc homeostasis in bacteria, yeast, and plants and its relevance to mammalian zinc metabolism is becoming increasingly clear. Mouse Zip4 is highly regulated by zinc status (15Dufner-Beattie J. Wang F. Kuo Y. Gitschier J. Eide D. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33474-33481Google Scholar). One component of this regulation occurs at the mRNA level; mZIP4 mRNA levels are high in zinc-limited animals and low when zinc replete. Regulation of mZip4 activity was also found to occur at a post-translational level. When expressed in cultured cells, the distribution of mZip4 changes in response to zinc status (23Kim B.E. Wang F. Dufner-Beattie J. Andrews G.K. Eide D.J. Petris M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 4523-4530Google Scholar). In zinc-limited cells, the protein is localized to the cell surface. Upon repletion, Zip4 is redistributed to intracellular organelles via zinc-stimulated endocytosis. The level of Zip4 on the plasma membrane serves to regulate the zinc uptake activity of the protein. Therefore, given the role of mZip4 in dietary zinc absorption, we propose that these transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms of controlling mZip4 activity provide for zinc homeostasis at the organism level. The identification of mammalian Zip1 and Zip3 has made it possible to analyze the regulation of mammalian zinc transporters of a different ZIP subfamily than that to which mZip4 belongs. Mouse and human Zip1 and mZip3 are expressed in many tissues. This observation, combined with the ability of these proteins to confer zinc-specific uptake activity in vitro, suggested that Zip1 and Zip3 are involved in providing zinc to a variety of cell types. Consistent with this hypothesis, inhibiting expression of hZip1 in K562 and PC-3 cells using anti-sense RNA dramatically reduced zinc uptake activity (18Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22258-22264Google Scholar, 28Franklin R.B. Ma J. Zou J. Guan Z. Kukoyi B.I. Feng P. Costello L.C. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2003; 96: 435-442Google Scholar). These results suggested that Zip1 is the major zinc uptake transporter in these cells. If true that mZip1 and mZip3 are important for zinc delivery to many types of cells, their regulation by zinc status could be a critical component of zinc homeostasis at the cellular level. In contrast to mZip4, little regulation of mZIP1 or mZIP3 mRNA levels by zinc status has been observed (19Dufner-Beattie J. Langmade S.J. Wang F. Eide D. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50142-50150Google Scholar, 22Cousins R.J. Blanchard R.K. Popp M.P. Liu L. Cao J. Moore J.B. Green C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6952-6957Google Scholar, 24Costello L.C. Liu Y. Zou J. Franklin R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17499-17504Google Scholar). These observations led us to investigate whether the activity of these proteins was regulated at a post-translational level. When cells were grown in zinc-replete basal medium, mZip1 and mZip3 were largely distributed to intracellular organelles and very little resided on the cell surface. However, this steady state distribution is maintained by a dynamic cycling of the proteins to the plasma membrane and rapid endocytosis. One way in which this was demonstrated was by treating cells with MCD, an endocytosis inhibitor, which resulted in accumulation of the proteins on the cell surface. Given that MCD impairs both clathrin- and caveolae-dependent endocytosis (27Rodal S.K. Skretting G. Garred O. Vilhardt F. van Deurs B. Sandvig K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 961-974Google Scholar), the specific pathway of endocytosis taken by these proteins is not yet established. Remarkably, when these cells were made zinc-deficient, mZip1 and mZip3 increased in cell surface abundance. This effect was the result of decreased endocytosis in zinc-limited cells. We propose that this is a homeostatic regulatory mechanism to increase zinc uptake during deficiency, and this conclusion was supported by the results of 65Zn uptake experiments. While effects of zinc on endocytosis rates were demonstrated, our studies do not preclude changes in exocytosis rates also occurring in response to zinc. Another major question is whether the distribution of endogenous mZip1 and/or mZip3 protein, as opposed to the protein expressed heterologously in a transfected cell, changes in response to zinc status. Although trafficking of endogenous mZip1 has not yet been examined, a recent study by Kelleher and Lonnerdal (25Kelleher S.L. Lonnerdal B. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 3378-3385Google Scholar) observed a zinc-responsive redistribution of endogenous mZip3 in cultured mouse mammary tumor cells. Without zinc, endogenous mZip3 was localized on the cell surface. Following zinc treatment, the protein was more abundant in intracellular compartments. We can now explain these results at a mechanistic level. Our results may also explain a paradox in the literature regarding the normal location of mammalian Zip1 protein. Human Zip1 was localized to the plasma membrane in non-adherent cells such as K562 erythroleukemia cells but was largely intracellular in adherent cells such as COS-7 and PC-3 despite culturing in the same medium (18Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22258-22264Google Scholar, 29Milon B. Dhermy D. Pountney D. Bourgeois M. Beaumont C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 241-246Google Scholar) (data not shown). One intriguing explanation for this difference in localization is that perhaps K562 cells lack the machinery required for zinc-stimulated endocytosis. Alternatively, zinc metabolism may differ between cell types such that K562 cells are zinc-deficient even when grown in basal medium. The mechanisms of zinc sensing that controls mZip1, mZip3, or mZip4 endocytosis are currently unknown. For example, our studies do not distinguish between sensing of intracellular or extracellular pools of zinc. TPEN is a membrane permeable chelator and therefore will perturb both intracellular and extracellular pools of zinc. Although the effects of incubation in Chelex-treated medium may initially suggest that sensing of extracellular zinc is involved, it must be recognized that intracellular pools of labile zinc are likely to be very small (30Outten C.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 2001; 292: 2488-2492Google Scholar). Thus, incubation in Chelex-treated medium may be sufficient to rapidly deplete intracellular zinc if steady replenishment of those supplies fails to occur for even short periods. It is also notable that the mZip proteins do not respond to similar degrees of zinc deficiency. The first hint of this difference was the observation that mZip1 and mZip4 were altered in distribution by incubation in Chelex-treated medium whereas mZip3 was unaffected. Only under the more severe conditions of TPEN treatment did surface levels of mZip3 increase. These data argued that stimulation of mZip3 endocytosis requires more zinc than does mZip1 or mZip4. This difference may reflect different zinc requirements of the respective tissues in which they are expressed. Alternatively, they may reflect a two-tiered system of zinc uptake in cells where both proteins are expressed. As these cells became increasing zinc-deficient, mZip1 would first localize to the surface while mZip3 would be mobilized under conditions of greater limitation. mZip1 and mZip3 have similar apparent Km values for zinc (19Dufner-Beattie J. Langmade S.J. Wang F. Eide D. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50142-50150Google Scholar) so this regulation would likely control the capacity rather than the affinity of the cellular zinc uptake systems. In summary, we have established in this report that the subcellular distributions of mZip1 and mZip3, and thereby their activities, are zinc regulated. Given that mZIP1 and mZIP3 mRNA levels change little in response to zinc status, we propose that this post-translational control is a major element of zinc homeostasis in the many cells in which these proteins are expressed. Furthermore, given that mZip1 and mZip3 are very divergent from mZip4, our results suggest that this post-translational control of zinc uptake activity is a conserved feature of mammalian ZIP proteins."

Although arrestins have traditionally been thought of as mediating GPCR desensitization, they have now been shown to play important roles in the internalization, trafficking, and signaling of many GPCRs. We demonstrate that in cells devoid of arrestins, the stimulation of numerous GPCRs including the N-formyl peptide receptor (FPR) initiates rapid cell rounding, annexin V positivity, and caspase activation followed by cell death. The apoptotic response is initiated by G protein signaling and involves activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinases, and c-Src resulting in cytochrome c release from mitochondria and ultimately caspase 9 and caspase 3 activation. Reconstitution with either arrestin-2 or arrestin-3 is completely sufficient to prevent FPR-mediated apoptosis. Surprisingly, a non-desensitizing and non-internalizing mutant of the FPR is unable to initiate apoptosis, indicating that receptor phosphorylation and internalization, but not solely chronic activation due to a lack of desensitization, are critical determinants for the induction of apoptosis by the FPR. We further demonstrate that this response is not unique to the FPR with numerous additional GPCRs, including the V2 vasopressin, angiotensin II (type 1A), and CXCR2 receptors, capable of initiating apoptosis upon stimulation, whereas GPCRs such as the β2-adrenergic receptor and CXCR4 are not capable of initiating apoptotic signaling. These data demonstrate for the first time that arrestins play a critical and completely unexpected role in the suppression GPCR-mediated apoptosis, which we show is a common consequence of GPCR-mediated cellular activation in the absence of arrestins.

Holt R.A. et al.Science. 2001; 291: 1304-1351Google Scholar), responding to light, odorants, peptides, proteins, lipids, ions, neurotransmitters, and hormones. Following ligand binding, GPCRs bind and activate specific G proteins, which in turn activate downstream effectors resulting in the generation of second messengers (2Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 927-932Google Scholar). Activated GPCRs rapidly undergo phosphorylation by G protein-coupled receptor kinases on serine and/or threonine residues located most often in the carboxyl-terminal domain of the protein. Receptor phosphorylation leads to the binding of arrestins (in non-visual cells, arrestin-2 and/or arrestin-3), resulting in desensitization of cellular activation through G proteins. However, in recent years, arrestins have been shown to regulate additional cellular signaling pathways by serving as multifunctional scaffold/adapter proteins (3Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 455-465Google Scholar). Through binding interactions with clathrin and the adapter AP-2, arrestin can mediate clathrin-dependent internalization of many GPCRs. In addition, arrestins can initiate the recruitment and activation of numerous kinases including c-Src family kinases (4Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Google Scholar) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), such as extracellular-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) (5Luttrell L.M. Roudabush F.L. Choy E.W. Miller W.E. Field M.E. Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2449-2454Google Scholar) and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase 3 (JNK3) (6McDonald P.H. Chow C.W. Miller W.E. Laporte S.A. Field M.E. Lin F.T. Davis R.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2000; 290: 1574-1577Google Scholar). The simultaneous direct binding of both the first and third MAPK components (Raf and ERK2 or apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 and JNK3) suggests that arrestins serve to increase the specificity of MAPK signaling as well as recruit the resulting kinase activity to the sites of activated GPCRs. Because of the diversity among GPCRs, it is perhaps not surprising that arrestins mediate different functions with distinct GPCRs despite the fact that virtually all of the GPCRs appear to bind arrestins as a consequence of receptor phosphorylation. Although many GPCRs, exemplified by the β2-adrenergic receptor, internalize in an arrestin-dependent manner (7Kohout T.A. Lin F.S. Perry S.J. Conner D.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1601-1606Google Scholar), a growing number of GPCRs (e.g. protease-activated receptor 1 (8Paing M.M. Stutts A.B. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Trejo J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1292-1300Google Scholar) and the N-formyl peptide receptor (FPR) (9Vines C.M. Revankar C.M. Maestas D.C. LaRusch L.L. Cimino D.F. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol.

Cimino D.F. Prossnitz E.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3467-3475Google Scholar) and partially phosphorylated receptor mutants (13Maestes D.C. Potter R.M. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29791-29795Google Scholar), which internalize in the absence of demonstrable arrestin binding, had suggested that receptor internalization does not require arrestin binding despite the observation that the FPR directly binds arrestins and colocalizes with them during receptor internalization (14Key T.A.

To investigate the roles of arrestins in GPCR function further, we recently expressed the FPR in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) that are deficient in both arrestin-2 and arrestin-3. Our results demonstrated that FPR internalization was unaffected by the absence of arrestins, indicating that the FPR despite binding arrestin in arrestin-replete cells does not require arrestin to internalize (9Vines C.M. Revankar C.M. Maestas D.C. LaRusch L.L. Cimino D.F. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41581-41584Google Scholar). However, further studies revealed that FPR recycling required arrestin, the first demonstration that arrestin is required for the proper trafficking of a GPCR back to the cell surface following internalization. In this report, we provide the first evidence that GPCR activation in the absence of arrestins initiates rapid apoptosis. This response is dependent on both receptor-mediated signaling as well as receptor phosphorylation and probably internalization. We conclude that arrestins play a critical, previously unknown, role in preventing apoptosis initiated by active GPCRs.

Jeffrey Benovic, Laszlo Hunyady, and Jurgen Wess, respectively. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts with and without β-arrestins were established as described previously (7Kohout T.A. Lin F.S. Perry S.J.

Stable clones expressing the FPR were generated and cultured as described previously (9Vines C.M. Revankar C.M. Maestas D.C. LaRusch L.L. Cimino D.F. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41581-41584Google Scholar). Cell Rounding and Cell Detachment Measurements—Cells grown on 12-mm round glass coverslips at 50% confluence were incubated with serum-free DMEM for 30 min before stimulation with the ligand at 37 °C as indicated and fixed for 15 min with chilled 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cellular morphology then was evaluated by phase-contrast microscopy. The criteria for round cells were spherical refractile cells with no visible extensions. A minimum of 300 cells (in at least five random fields) was evaluated for rounded versus well adhered cells. To measure the percentage of cells detached, adherent cells on the coverslip were trypsinized and counted on a hemocytometer. The percentage of detached cells was calculated from the difference between the number of cells originally seeded and the number of cells attached after the indicated period of time. Annexin V/Propidium Iodide (PI) Staining—Cells grown on 12-mm round glass coverslips at 50% confluence were incubated with serum-free DMEM for 30 min before stimulation with the ligand at 37 °C as indicated. The cells were stained with annexin V-FITC (1:25, Caltag Laboratories) and PI (1 μg/ml, Sigma) in annexin V binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2) and incubated for 10-15 min at room temperature in the dark and fixed for 15 min with chilled 2% PFA in PBS. The coverslips were then rinsed twice with annexin V binding buffer and analyzed on Zeiss LSM 510 confocal system. Annexin V-FITC and PI were excited at 488 and 546 nm, respectively. The cells showing visible annexin V staining (with no PI staining) were categorized as apoptotic cells. Similarly, cells showing both annexin V and PI staining were categorized as late apoptotic cells. Differential interference contrast images were collected simultaneously with the fluorescence images using the transmitted light detector. PI was assessed by flow cytometry in FL3. Activated Caspase 3 and Cytochrome c Staining—For activated (cleaved) caspase 3 analysis, 2 × 104 cells seeded onto 12-mm glass coverslips were treated as indicated and fixed for 15 min with chilled 2% PFA in PBS, permeabilized, and blocked for 60 min with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS with 3% bovine serum albumin. After washing once, cells were incubated with activated caspase 3 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) diluted in 3% normal goat serum for2hat room temperature in a humidified chamber. Cells were washed in PBS and then incubated with Alexa-568-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) diluted in 3% normal goat serum. Cells were rinsed three times in PBS and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). To calculate the percentage of activated caspase 3-positive cells, a minimum of 300 cells/experiment was counted on a Zeiss Axiovert microscope. For mitochondrion and cytochrome c staining, cells were first stained with 25 nm Mitotracker Red for 20 min at 37 °C, fixed for 15 min with chilled 2% PFA in PBS, and subsequently permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS with 3% bovine serum albumin for 60 min. Cells were then incubated with anti-cytochrome c antibody (BD Biosciences) for 2 h. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody diluted in 3% normal goat serum. Cells were rinsed, mounted in Vectashield, and visualized on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal system. CaspaTag staining was carried out as described by the manufacturer (Serologicals Inc.) and quantitated by flow cytometry. Inhibitor Studies—Cells seeded onto 12-mm glass coverslips were pretreated with inhibitors for the concentration and time period as indicated in the figure legend. In the presence of inhibitors, the cells were treated with serum-free DMEM with or without ligand for 300 min and fixed with chilled 2% PFA. The percentage of rounded cells was calculated as described above. Transient Transfections of GPCRs—GPCR constructs were generated by PCR and confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. Cells (2 × 105/well) seeded in a 24-well plate were transfected with GFP constructs using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. The cells were reseeded onto 12-mm glass coverslips after 24 h. The ligands, times, and concentrations used for stimulation were as indicated in the figure legends. Cell rounding and PI staining were determined as a percentage of the transfected (GFP-positive) cells. GPCR Activation Initiates Cell Death in Arrestin-/- Cells—Because arrestins have become central players in the regulation of multiple kinase pathways (19McDonald P.H. Lefkowitz R.J. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 683-689Google Scholar, 20Pierce K.L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1532-1539Google Scholar, 21Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 727-733Google Scholar), many of which are known to regulate cellular growth and proliferation, we sought to examine the relationship between GPCR activation and arrestin-mediated functions with respect to cell proliferation. The development and maintenance of complex organisms and tissues is dependent upon physiologically regulated cell death or apoptosis (22Vaux D.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 245-254Google Scholar). Dysregulated apoptosis is a crucial component in numerous disease states including cancer, (auto) immune disorders, and neurodegenerative disorders (23Evan G. Littlewood T. Science. 1998; 281: 1317-1322Google Scholar). Additionally, defects in visual arrestin (arrestin-1) are known to mediate retinal degeneration through necrotic and apoptotic mechanisms in organisms ranging from Drosophila to humans (24Miller W.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Science's STKE. 2001; http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2001/53/pe1Google Scholar, 25Dolph P.J. Ranganathan R. Colley N.J. Hardy R.W. Socolich M. Zuker C.S. Science. 1993; 260: 1910-1916Google Scholar, 26Ranganathan R. Science. 2003; 299: 1677-1679Google Scholar). Finally, arrestin-2/3 double knock-out mice do not survive until birth, indicating a critical role in embryonic development (27Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 9-18Google Scholar). Thus, to examine whether, in the absence of arrestins, GPCR stimulation would affect the proliferative capacity of cells, MEF cells derived from knock-out mice that lack arrestin-2 (arr2-/-), arrestin-3 (arr3-/-), or both arrestins (arr2/3-/-) as well as two wild-type littermate controls (WT1 and WT2) stably expressing with the FPR were evaluated (9Vines C.M. Revankar C.M. Maestas D.C. LaRusch L.L. Cimino D.F. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41581-41584Google Scholar). Stimulation of FPR-transduced arr2/3-/- MEF (arr2/3-/- MEFFPR) cells with agonist resulted in the rounding of cells followed by detachment of a significant fraction (30-40%) of the rounded cells (Fig. 1a, bottom right panel). This was not observed in stimulated FPR-expressing WT cells (Fig. 1a, upper right panel). Quantitation of the cell rounding revealed that the response was rapid with >50% of the cells having rounded at 1 h and with ∼80% of the cells having rounded by 4-5 h (Fig. 1b). To address whether this response was specifically because of the absence of either arrestin-2 or arrestin-3, we examined cell rounding of stimulated FPR-expressing arr2-/- and arr3-/- cells individually. Neither of these cell lines displayed agonist-promoted cell rounding after 5 h of stimulation. These results indicate that the presence of either arrestin-2 or arrestin-3 is sufficient to suppress the cell rounding induced by FPR stimulation. To examine whether the cell rounding was a manifestation of programmed/apoptotic cell death, we stimulated both WT and arr2/3-/- MEF cells expressing the FPR with agonist and assessed apoptotic events by annexin V-FITC/PI staining (Fig. 2a). Agonist-stimulated arr2/3-/- MEF-FPR cells underwent a significant increase in the percentage of rounded cells by 1-2h, whereas the kinetics of nuclear PI staining (indicating cell membrane breakdown) were delayed by 2-3 h. Unstimulated arr2/3-/- MEF-FPR cells or stimulated and unstimulated WT MEF-FPR cells, which remained fully adherent, were completely viable (PI-negative). Annexin V staining (in the absence of PI staining), a reporter of phosphatidylserine accumulation on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, an early event in many mechanisms of apoptosis, was consistently elevated in the stimulated arr2/3-/- MEF-FPR cells as compared with the wild-type cells (Fig. 2b). The number of annexin V-positive/PI-negative cells remained constant between 10 and 15% of the cells from 1 to 24 h as the number of PI-positive cells increased from ∼10 to 80% in the same time period (Fig. 2c). Because one of the hallmarks of apoptotic signaling is the activation of caspases (28Van Cruchten S. Van Den Broeck W. Anat. Histol. Embryol. 2002; 31: 214-223Google Scholar), we evaluated the activity of cellular caspases using a pan-fluorescent caspase inhibitor, CaspaTag, that binds only to proteolytically activated caspases. CaspaTag staining increased over time only in the arrestin-deficient cells (Fig. 2d) in a manner that paralleled the increase in PI staining (cf. Fig. 2, c and d). To confirm that caspase 3 in particular was activated, we used an antibody that recognizes only the active-cleaved form of caspase 3, the terminal caspase in most apoptotic pathways. Only stimulated arr2/3-/- MEF-FPR cells demonstrated a stimulation-specific increase in the level of active caspase 3-positive cells (Fig. 2e). Furthermore, although a significant fraction of the adherent rounded cells were caspase 3-positive, a smaller but significant fraction of the remaining adherent spread cells was also caspase 3-positive (not shown). The observation that spread cells were caspase 3-positive suggests that the cellular activation of caspases precedes the rounding and detachment of cells from the substratum and subsequent death, indicating that cell death is not induced by de-adhesion, a process that has been termed anoikis. The involvement of caspases in this process is specific for and defines apoptosis (28Van Cruchten S. Van Den Broeck W. Anat. Histol. Embryol. 2002; 31: 214-223Google Scholar). Arrestins and Phosphorylation-deficient Receptors Rescue Apoptosis—To demonstrate definitively that the observed apoptotic events in the FPR-expressing arr2/3-/- MEF cells were specifically because of the absence of both arrestin-2 and arrestin-3, we transiently transfected arrestin-2 and arrestin-3 GFP fusions into the FPR-expressing arrestin double knock-out cell line. The reintroduction of either arrestin-2-GFP or arrestin-3-GFP, but not GFP alone, was capable of rescuing the apoptotic phenotype (Fig. 3a). There was no additional effect of coexpressing arrestin-2 and arrestin-3. Because arrestin is known to desensitize GPCR signaling through G proteins, we examined whether the apoptotic phenotype could be the result of prolonged cellular activation in the arr2/3-/- MEF-FPR cells. To test this directly, we expressed a mutant form of the FPR (ΔST) in which all of the serine and threonine residues of the carboxyl terminus have been substituted with alanine and glycine residues. We have previously demonstrated that this FPR mutant neither desensitizes nor internalizes (29Hsu M.H. Chiang S.C. Ye R.D. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29426-29429Google Scholar, 30Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15213-15219Google Scholar). Thus, if a lack of desensitization was responsible for excessive signaling leading to apoptosis, the ΔST FPR should recapitulate the effects of the arrestin deficiency not only in the arr2/3-/- MEF cells but also in the WT cells where arrestin is present but does not bind to the receptor. Surprisingly, the ΔST FPR did not induce cell rounding in either the double knock-out or the WT cells (Fig. 3b), indicating that FPR phosphorylation and its sequelae such as receptor internalization but not chronic receptor activation per se are necessary to induce apoptotic events in the absence of arrestins. Activation of Multiple Downstream Effectors Is Required for Apoptosis—The observation that the activation of caspases preceded the rounding and detachment of cells from the matrix, observed to begin between 60 and 90 min, suggested that relatively rapid signaling events initiated by the FPR were responsible for this phenomenon. To investigate these mechanisms further, we employed a panel of signal transduction inhibitors to examine the effects of blocking specific pathways resulting from FPR activation and leading to apoptosis (Fig. 4). Of the inhibitors tested, p38, MEK, and JNK MAPK inhibitors as well as inhibitors of Gαi/o protein (pertussis toxin), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (wortmannin and LY294002), and Src kinases (PP2) completely blocked the cell rounding and cell death induced by stimulation of the FPR. Protein kinase C inhibitors (staurosporine, Ro-31-8220, and GF109203X) and the calmodulin inhibitor fluphenazine had no inhibitory effect on the level of FPR-induced cell rounding in the arr2/3-/- MEF cells, although all four induced a lower extent of cell rounding in the WT cells, consistent with known properties of these compounds. In addition, the epidermal growth factor receptor kinase inhibitor AG1478 had no effect on cell rounding, indicating that transactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor was not involved. Finally, as suggested by the activation of caspases prior to cell rounding (Fig. 3), the irreversible pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk was completely effective in blocking FPR-induced cell rounding, detachment, and death, confirming that caspase activation represents a critical event in the GPCR-mediated apoptosis of arrestin-deficient cells. GPCR-induced Apoptosis Is Executed through the Mitochondrial Pathway—The caspase family of proteases are differentially involved in both the initiation phases (31Chen M. Wang J. Apoptosis. 2002; 7: 313-319Google Scholar) of apoptosis as well as the propagation and effector phases of the response (32Philchenkov A.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 68: 365-376Google Scholar). Whereas caspase 8 has been shown to be required for Fas-induced death, multiple classical apoptotic signals are propagated through the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and the activation of caspase 9 (31Chen M. Wang J. Apoptosis. 2002; 7: 313-319Google Scholar). Additionally, caspase 2 has recently been described to function as an initiator caspase (33Troy C.M. Shelanski M.L. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 101-107Google Scholar). All initiator caspase activation leads to the eventual proteolytic activation of the effector caspase 3, which cleaves large numbers of cellular proteins leading to apoptosis. We tested the effects of specific caspase inhibitors for caspases 2, 3, 8, and 9 on FPR-induced apoptosis. Inhibitors of caspases 9 and 3 but not 2 or 8 inhibited FPR-induced cell rounding to the same extent as the pan-caspase inhibitor, suggesting that the mitochondrial route of caspase activation was involved (Fig. 5a). To test this finding, we examined the cellular distribution of cytochrome c upon FPR stimulation (Fig. 5b). Whereas cytochrome c is confined completely to mitochondria in unstimulated arr2/3-/- MEF-FPR cells and stimulated arr2/3+/+ MEF-FPR cells, agonist stimulation of arr2/3-/- MEF-FPR cells results in the redistribution of cytochrome c to the cytosol. In addition, the structure of the mitochondria as determined by Mitotracker Red staining is significantly degraded in the stimulated arrestin-deficient cells, suggesting that GPCR activation leads to compromised mitochondrial integrity. Multiple GPCRs Are Capable of Initiating Apoptosis—Finally, to determine whether the activation of other GPCRs in arr2/3-/- MEF cells also resulted in the initiation of apoptotic signaling leading to cell detachment and death, we expressed the β2-adrenergic, angiotensin II (type 1A), and vasopressin V2 receptors as well as the chemokine receptors for IL-8 (CXCR2) and stromal-derived factor-1α (CXCR4) in WT and arr2/3-/- MEF cells. Each of these receptors was stimulated with the appropriate ligand and assessed for apoptotic events as evidenced by cell rounding. As with the FPR, stimulation of the IL-8 and angiotensin receptors in arr2/3-/- MEF cells induced cell rounding of ∼80% of the cells, whereas stimulation of the vasopressin receptor induced rounding in ∼60% of the cells (Fig. 6a). However, stimulation of neither the β2-adrenergic receptor nor CXCR4 expressed in arr2/3-/- MEF cells initiated apoptotic events above the basal levels observed in the WT cells. To verify that the cell rounding induced by these receptors was an accurate indicator of apoptotic signaling leading to cell death, we evaluated the cells for PI staining and sensitivity of cell rounding to caspase inhibition. In all of the cases, rounded cells became PI-positive over time and the response was completely blocked by caspase inhibition with the exception of the IL-8 receptor where caspase inhibition yielded only a 50% decrease in PI+ cells (Fig. 6b). Although the FPR and the IL-8 receptor both signal through pertussis toxin-sensitive Gαi proteins (11Prossnitz E.R. Ye R.D. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 74: 73-102Google Scholar, 34Ono S.J. Nakamura T. Miyazaki D. Ohbayashi M. Dawson M. Toda M. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2003; 111: 1185-1199Google Scholar), the angiotensin receptor signals predominantly through Gαq (35Inagami T. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: S2-S7Google Scholar) and the vasopressin receptor signals through Gαs (36Liu J. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8772-8778Google Scholar). These results suggest that apoptotic signaling in the absence of arrestins is mediated by a distinct subset of GPCRs, which signal through a wide variety of G protein subtypes. In this report, we have described a previously unknown function of arrestins 2 and 3, namely the suppression of apoptotic signaling following GPCR activation. In the absence of arrestins, FPR stimulation and phosphorylation result in the activation of numerous downstream effectors as well as the internalization of the receptor. This signaling leads to the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, resulting in the initiation of apoptotic signaling. Arrestins, by virtue of their ubiquitous expression and interactions with essentially every GPCR, as well as growth factor receptors (e.g. insulin-like growth factor receptor (37Lin F.T. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31640-31643Google Scholar) and transforming growth factor-β receptor (38Chen W. Kirkbride K.C. How T. Nelson C.D. Mo J. Frederick J.P. Wang X.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Blobe G.C. Science. 2003; 301: 1394-1397Google Scholar)), thus are poised to regulate cellular proliferation and apoptosis of virtually every type of cell. By acting as a bridge or scaffold to multiple intracellular signaling cascades, arrestins can influence GPCR localization as well as the activation and localization of downstream signaling pathways including Src and MAPKs. In addition, arrestins have recently been shown to effect insulin-like growth factor-mediated recovery following serum deprivation through the activation of Akt, suggesting a direct role in proliferative signaling through insulin-like growth factor receptors (39Povsic T.J. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51334-51339Google Scholar). In contrast to this proliferative signaling, we have described a distinct and unique function for arrestins, namely the suppression of apoptotic signaling initiated by GPCRs. At this point, there are many possible mechanisms by which GPCR-mediated signaling in the absence of arrestins may initiate apoptosis. Our results demonstrate the involvement of a diverse array of signaling components including G proteins, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, Src, MAPKs, and caspases. It is possible that the localization of certain signaling events in the cells is altered in the absence of arrestin as has been documented for the ERK and JNK, supporting our findings that these kinases play a role. A specific role for JNK (JNK1 and JNK2) in UV-induced apoptosis of MEF cells has been described, which involves mitochondrial-specific pathways (40Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Science. 2000; 288: 870-874Google Scholar). Because the arrestin-JNK interaction is specific to arrestin-3 and JNK3 (which is absent in MEF cells) (6McDonald P.H. Chow C.W. Miller W.E. Laporte S.A. Field M.E. Lin F.T. Davis R.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2000; 290: 1574-1577Google Scholar, 40Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Science. 2000; 288: 870-874Google Scholar), it likely does not represent the route of stimulation resulting in apoptosis described here, which notably can be rescued by arrestin-2 in addition to arrestin-3. However, the observation that FPR phosphorylation and internalization but not chronic stimulation alone are required for the initiation of apoptotic signaling suggests that aberrantly localized signaling may be at fault and that one critical role of arrestin is to secure the appropriately localized series of signaling events. Contrary to the observations described here using mammalian cells, in the Drosophila eye, visual arrestin can participate in apoptotic signaling under circumstances where the receptor phosphatase (rdgC) or an eye-specific phospholipase C (norpA) is absent (41Alloway P.G. Howard L. Dolph P.J. Neuron. 2000; 28: 129-138Google Scholar, 42Kiselev A. Socolich M. Vinos J. Hardy R.W. Zuker C.S. Ranganathan R. Neuron. 2000; 28: 139-152Google Scholar). Under these circumstances, a stable internalized rhodopsin-arrestin complex is formed that results in the initiation of G protein-independent apoptosis. Alternatively, apoptosis initiated by chronic stimulation of rhodopsin signaling in wild-type photoreceptor cells is largely G protein-dependent. Inhibition of clathrin-mediated processes (internalization and trafficking) in Drosophila can rescue this rhodopsin-initiated apoptosis, suggesting that rhodopsin-arrestin complex internalization may be required for this pathway in WT photoreceptor cells. It should be noted, however, that mammalian rhodopsins do not interact with clathrin and are not known to undergo internalization/trafficking following activation and arrestin binding (24Miller W.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Science's STKE. 2001; http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2001/53/pe1Google Scholar). Although our results also demonstrate a requirement for GPCR internalization in mammalian cell apoptosis, this occurs only in the absence of arrestins and additionally requires G protein signaling to numerous intracellular effectors. This differs from apoptosis of the Drosophila norpA mutant, which requires arrestin; therefore, rhodopsin internalization yet occurs independent of G protein signaling. The mechanism we describe also differs from the necrosis of arrestin-deficient photoreceptor cells, which are G protein-dependent yet does not require rhodopsin internalization. Thus, our results describe an entirely novel pathway for GPCR-mediated apoptosis that occurs in mammalian cells not expressing arrestins. Whether and under what physiological circumstances arrestins regulate cellular proliferation and apoptosis remain to be determined. With the recent description of cellular arrestin levels being depleted by ubiquitination as a result of the stimulation of tyrosine kinase receptors (43Dalle S. Imamura T. Rose D.W. Worrall D.S. Ugi S. Hupfeld C.J. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6272-6285Google Scholar), it is intriguing to speculate that the balance of cellular proliferation and apoptosis can be regulated in such a manner. Not only does such a mechanism suggest novel pathways in development and disease, it also implies that the specific manipulation of arrestins may provide a therapeutic means to induce apoptosis of cancerous cells. We are grateful to Robert Lefkowitz for providing the parental MEF cell lines used in this study. We also thank Leah LaRusch for technical assistance and Jin Wang and Steven Van Cruchten for helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2134515111,"Peroxiredoxins are a family of abundant peroxidases found in all organisms. Although these antioxidant enzymes are thought to be critically involved in cellular defense and redox signaling, their exact physiological roles are largely unknown. In this study, we took a genetic approach to address the functions of peroxiredoxins in budding yeast. We generated and characterized a yeast mutant lacking all five peroxiredoxins. The quintuple peroxiredoxin-null mutant was still viable, though the growth rate was lower under normal aerobic conditions. Although peroxiredoxins are not essential for cell viability, peroxiredoxin-null yeast cells were more susceptible to oxidative and nitrosative stress. In the complete absence of peroxiredoxins, the expression of other antioxidant proteins including glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase was induced. In addition, the quintuple mutant was hypersensitive to glutathione depletion. Thus, the glutathione system might cooperate with other antioxidant enzymes to compensate for peroxiredoxin deficiency. Interestingly, the peroxiredoxinnull yeast cells displayed an increased rate of spontaneous mutations that conferred resistance to canavanine. This mutator phenotype was rescued by yeast peroxiredoxin Tsa1p, but not by its active-site mutant defective for peroxidase activity. Our findings suggest that the antioxidant function of peroxiredoxins is important for maintaining genome stability in eukaryotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1979285366,"Like other nuclear receptors, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) use a wide variety of protein-protein interactions to properly regulate transcription of target genes. In an attempt to identify novel PPAR-interacting proteins, a cDNA expression library was screened with bacterially expressed PPARα. One of the genes identified as a PPARα-associated protein by interaction cloning was the CREB-binding protein/p300-interacting transactivator with ED-rich tail 2 (CITED2, also called p35srj/mrg1/msg1). This coactivator interacted directly with PPARα in the presence or absence of ligand predominantly via the ligand binding domain of the nuclear receptor. In transient transfection reporter assays, CITED2 acted as a dose-dependent coactivator of PPARα-dependent transcriptional regulation in the presence of several exogenous ligands. CITED2 also increased PPARγ-dependent regulation of reporter genes but had no effect on PPARβ activity. To determine whether CITED2 affects endogenous gene expression, this protein was stably overexpressed (CITED2+) or repressed by small inhibitor RNA (CITED2–) in immortalized mouse hepatocytes. Relative to the control stably transfected or CITED2–cells, CITED2+ cells had an increased rate of cell proliferation. Microarray analysis and real time PCR showed that several genes are differentially affected by PPARα ligands in CITED2+ versus CITED2–cells. Genes that were affected by PPARα ligands in a CITED2-modulatory manner include angiopoietin-like protein 4, forkhead C2, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, and MAPK phosphatase 1. Interestingly these genes share common functions in that they are known to promote vascularization and angiogenesis in response to hypoxia. The results described here suggest that CIT-ED2 is a coactivator of PPARα and that both proteins may participate in signaling cascades of hypoxic response and angiogenesis.

The receptors, so named for their ability to respond to a class of compounds deemed peroxisome proliferators, have been implicated in a wide range of biological processes such as cell growth, lipid homeostasis, apoptosis, and response to xenobiotics and endogenous compounds. In particular, PPARα has a role in carcinogenesis with peroxisome proliferators being potent hepatocarcinogens in rodents (for a review, see Ref. 2Roberts-Thomson S.J. Immunol. Cell Biol. 2000; 78: 436-441Google Scholar). The regulation of gene expression by PPARs follows the classic NR mechanism whereby the receptor binds to ligand, translocates to the nucleus, heterodimerizes (retinoid X receptor α), binds to a conserved response element (DR1) in the promoter region of the target gene, and regulates transcription. One aspect of this mechanism that has drawn increasing attention is the potential protein-protein interactions that lead to the proper regulation of the target gene. Several proteins, often called coregulators, have been identified in the nuclear receptor transcription complexes that affect target gene expression. The family of coregulator proteins can be divided into two basic classes, coactivators that serve to increase the level of transcriptional activation of a gene and corepressors that do the opposite. These proteins come in many forms and may or may not contain enzymatic activity such as histone acetyltransferase (e.g. CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300) or histone deacetylase (e.g. nuclear receptor co-repressor). Those coregulators that do not contain enzymatic activity are thought to serve as a protein bridge that span the distance between the transcription factor and the elements of the complex that act directly upon the target gene. It is these bridging proteins that serve to further regulate transcription by helping to create distinct transcriptional complexes in response to particular chemicals whether endogenous or exogenous. Many coactivators have been initially isolated as PPAR coactivators such as PPAR-binding protein (3Zhu Y. Qi C. Jain S. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25500-25506Google Scholar), PPARγ coactivator-1 (4Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Google Scholar), and PPAR receptor interaction protein (same as thyroid receptor-binding protein (5Zhu Y. Kan L. Qi C. Kanwar Y.S. Yeldandi A.V. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13510-13516Google Scholar)). The CBP/p300-interacting transactivator with ED-rich tail (CITED) family of proteins contains four members to date. This class of protein has a highly acidic carboxyl-terminal end that interacts with CBP/p300. The CITED proteins affect the transcriptional activity of many transcription factors ranging from AP2 (6Braganca J. Eloranta J.J. Bamforth S.D. Ibbitt J.C. Hurst H.C. Bhattacharya S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16021-16029Google Scholar), estrogen receptor (7Yahata T. Shao W. Endoh H. Hur J. Coser K.R. Sun H. Ueda Y. Kato S. Isselbacher K.J. Brown M. Shioda T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2598-2612Google Scholar), and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) (8Yin Z. Haynie J. Yang X. Han B. Kiatchoosakun S. Restivo J. Yuan S. Prabhakar N.R. Herrup K. Conlon R.A. Hoit B.D. Watanabe M. Yang Y.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10488-10493Google Scholar). One member of this family, CITED2 (also called p35srj, mrg1, and msg1), is involved in the transcriptional repression of HIF1α (8Yin Z. Haynie J. Yang X. Han B. Kiatchoosakun S. Restivo J. Yuan S. Prabhakar N.R. Herrup K. Conlon R.A. Hoit B.D. Watanabe M. Yang Y.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10488-10493Google Scholar). Previous studies have suggested that CITED2 plays a role in the development of the nervous system since the CITED2–/– mouse died in late gestation and showed malformation in the mid and hind brain (9Bamforth S.D. Braganca J. Eloranta J.J. Murdoch J.N. Marques F.I. Kranc K.R. Farza H. Henderson D.J. Hurst H.C. Bhattacharya S. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 469-474Google Scholar). CITED2 can repress INK4a/ARF via regulation of Bmi1/Mel18 leading to decreased cell proliferation (10Kranc K.R. Bamforth S.D. Braganca J. Norbury C. Van Lohuizen M. Bhattacharya S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7658-7666Google Scholar). This is significant since the main phenotype of the CITED2–/– mouse is defects in neural tube closure that is thought to be caused by a loss of cell proliferation and increased cell death. In these studies, CITED2 was identified as a PPARα-associated protein in an interaction cloning screen. Due to the role of CITED2 as a coactivator and a CBP/p300 bridging factor, we hypothesized that it would affect the transcriptional activity of PPARα. Using a variety of in vivo and in vitro assays, we demonstrated that CITED2 directly interacts with PPARα and acts as an exogenous ligand-dependent and -independent coactivator. Also we demonstrated that CITED2 can affect cell cycle regulation and gene expression in hepatocytes in the absence of exogenous PPARα activators.

Cells were treated with Me2SO, 50 μm Wy-14,643, or 100 μm conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) for 6 h. Luciferase activity was measured using the Dual Luciferase kit (Promega). Luciferase activity was corrected for transfection efficiency (pRLTK) and extraction yield (via total protein assay). HepG2 and MuSH transfections were carried out with identical DNA concentrations and technique unless noted. All treatments were for 6 h with 50 μm Wy-14,643, 100 μm CLA, 100 μm ciprofibrate, or Me2SO. Pull-down of in Vitro Translated CITED2—In vitro translated human CITED2 was radiolabeled with [35S]methionine and incubated with bacterially expressed PPARα-MBP for 1 h at 4 °C in the presence of amylose resin. Resin was collected and washed three times with cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Bound protein was eluted from the resin using 10 mm maltose in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer for 1 min at 4 °C. Eluate was resolved on a 12% Tris-glycine gel, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA from 10 different mouse tissues was purchased (Ambion), and reverse transcription-PCR for CITED2 (see Table I) and β-actin was performed essentially as described previously (14Belury M.A. Moya-Camarena S.Y. Sun H. Snyder E. Davis II, J.W. Cunningham M.L. Vanden Heuvel J.P. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1998; 151: 254-261Google Scholar). Products were resolved on a 2% high resolution agarose gel (Cambrex) and quantified by densitometry.Table IPCR primersGeneForwardReverseGenBank™ accession no.CITED25′-atgggcatggggcagttcc-3′5′-tgggggtaggggtgatggttg-3′NM_010828ANGPTL45′-gagcaacaggaaacaaatggc-3′5′-tgatattcagtgcccctcgag-3′AF278699HIF1α5′-gaatgctcagaggaagcgaaa-3′5′-ttccaattcctgctgcttga-3′AF003695FOXc25′-gcagggctggcagaacag-3′5′-cgcggcactttcacgaa-3′Y08222MKP-15′-tgtcgctccttcttcgcttt-3′5′-tgaagcgcacgttcactga-3′NM_013642 Open table in a new tab Mouse Oligonucleotide Arrays—The Mouse Genome Oligo Set Version 1 was purchased from Operon (Alameda, CA) and contains 6800 optimized 70-mers plus 24 controls with melting temperature normalized to 78 °C. Sequences were optimized by the manufacturer using BLAST against all known mouse genes to minimize cross-hybridization. Oligonucleotides were printed onto glass slides using GeneMachines Omnigrid (San Carlos, CA) with additional controls obtained from Stratagene (SpotReport system, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) at the Pennsylvania State University microarray core facility. Microarray Analysis—Total RNA was isolated by TriReagent (Sigma) and further purified with RNAEasy (Qiagen) according the manufacturers' instructions. Details of the microarray analysis including reverse transcription, labeling, and hybridization can be found elsewhere (13Tien E.S. Gray J.P. Peters J.M. Vanden Heuvel J.P. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5767-5780Google Scholar). In the present experiments, co-hybridization was performed with cDNA from CITED2+-treated cells labeled with Cy5 and those from control-transfected samples labeled with Cy3. Scanning was performed by a GenePix 4000A scanner (Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA), and image acquisition was performed with Axon GenePix image software. Analysis of gene expression data was performed using GeneSpring software (Silicon Genetics Inc., Redwood City, CA) and PathwayAssist (Ariadne Genomics, Rockville, MD) (see supplemental data). Statistical Analysis of Microarray—Normalization and analysis of the gene expression profiles were performed as described previously (13Tien E.S. Gray J.P. Peters J.M. Vanden Heuvel J.P. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5767-5780Google Scholar). Intensity-dependent normalization was also applied where the ratio was reduced to the residual value of the Lowess fit of the intensity versus ratio curve. Statistical analysis was performed using a Student's t test with a p value of 0.05 with the additional criteria of being either 1.5-fold increased or decreased in CITED2+-versus control-transfected cells. Genes that met these parameters were classified by molecular function using annotations from Silicon Genetics or Ariadne Genomics. Real Time PCR—Total RNA was isolated as before. The total RNA was reverse transcribed using the ABI High Capacity cDNA archive kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Standard curves were made using serial dilutions from pooled cDNA samples. Real time PCR was performed using the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's protocol and amplified on the ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system. RNA Inhibitor Design—A double-stranded RNA inhibitor for CIT-ED2 was designed using the sequence from GenBank™. The sequence was synthesized and cloned into the pSUPER.neo plasmid (Oligoengine, Seattle, WA). All transfections of RNAi plasmids were performed using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. The sequence chosen for the CITED2 RNAi is as follows: 5′-CCACTACATGCCGGATTTG-3′. Western Blot Analysis—Total cell protein was isolated using cell lysis solution (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NAF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate) and lysing on ice for 30 min followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was removed as total soluble protein. Total soluble protein (50 μg) was separated on a 12% Tris-glycine gel and electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore). Membranes were washed three times with TBS, 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS+), blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS+ for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times with TBS+, and incubated while rocking at room temperature for 1 h with primary antibodies. Immunoblotting was performed using a mouse anti-CITED2 antibody (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO) in TBS+, 0.5% dry milk. The blot was washed three times with TBS+ and incubated at room temperature for 1 h with anti-mouse (Amersham Biosciences) at 1:10,000 dilution in TBS+, 0.5% dry milk. The blot was then washed three times with TBS+, and visualization was performed using enhanced chemiluminescent visualization (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Cell Growth Analysis—Cells of interest were plated at 200 cells/well in a 96-well plate, allowed to recover overnight in normal defined medium, and treated with 50 μm Wy-14,643 or Me2SO for 72 h. Quantitation of cell number was performed using the CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Reagent (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Day 0 absorbances were taken to ensure even cell plating. Identification of CITED2 as a PPAR Transcriptional Coregulator—The screening of the 3 × 106 plaques from a cDNA expression library with PPARα-MBP produced seven reproducible positive interacting clones (data not shown). 2J. P. Gray, J.W. Davis II, T. L. Leas, C. A. Nugent, and J. P. Vanden Heuvel, manuscript submitted. Each clone was sequenced and compared with GenBank™. One of the interacting clones contained 437 bp that corresponds to the 3′-end of the nuclear protein CITED2 (p35srj (15Bhattacharya S. Michels C.L. Leung M.K. Arany Z.P. Kung A.L. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 64-75Google Scholar)). The interaction between this partial sequence and PPARα was verified in a yeast two-hybrid assay (data not shown). To determine whether a direct interaction occurred between CITED2 and PPARα, pull-down studies were performed. Full-length human CITED2 in the pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector was in vitro translated in the presence of [35S]methionine. Full-length rat PPARα-MBP was expressed using a bacterial expression system, the in vitro translated human CIT-ED2 was added, and the mixture was passed over an amylose resin, washed, and eluted with excess maltose. As shown in Fig. 1, in vitro translated human CITED2 could interact with PPARα in the presence or absence of a known ligand (Wy-14,643, 50 μm). When expressed alone, the MBP epitope tag did not significantly interact with CITED2. To examine the association in vivo and to map the interaction between PPARα and CITED2, mammalian two-hybrid experiments were performed. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with full-length rat PPARα or each domain individually fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain (pM-PPARα) and human CITED2 fused to the VP16 activation domain (VP16-CITED2). As shown in Fig. 2, an interaction between PPARα and CITED2 was observed using full-length PPARα (A–F) or just the D domain alone. If other domains were fused to the D domain, such as C or E/F, there was a noticeable decrease in association between PPARα and CITED2, indicating cross-domain interference. Interestingly the basal activity of the pM-AB domain, which contains the ligand-independent activation domain, was significantly decreased by VP16-CITED2. Unlike what was observed in vitro, the association between PPARα and CITED2 was enhanced by ligand treatment in the mammalian two-hybrid experiments. The association of CIT-ED2 to the ligand binding domain (D–F) of PPARα was significantly enhanced by both Wy-14,643 and CLA. Similar studies were performed using CITED2 without the heterologous transactivation domain. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with pM-PPARα and pcDNA3/CITED2 or empty pcDNA3 vector (Fig. 3A). The GAL4 response element reporter (pFR-luciferase) was used to assess the effects of CIT-ED2 on PPARα activity. CITED2 increased the PPARα-driven reporter activity when exogenous ligands were added (Wy-14,643 and ciprofibrate) and also increased activity in the absence of exogenous ligand. When a PPRE reporter was used (HD-Luciferase), essentially identical results were obtained (Fig. 3B). HepG2 cells were cotransfected with pBK/PPARα, pcDNA3/CITED2 (or control), and HD-Luciferase. In this study, CITED2 increased the PPRE-driven reporter activity in the presence of exogenous ligands Wy-14,643 and CLA. In these and in several other subsequent experiments, three different PPARα activators were used to examine the potential for differential gene regulation in response to agonists with varying efficacy. The reason for this inclusion is the fact that one potential mechanism by which selective receptor modulators may have differing effects is through affecting the coactivators they recruit to the transcriptional complex. The ability of CITED2 to act as a PPARα coregulator was further characterized by examining reporter activity in the presence of increasing amounts of CITED2 plasmid (Fig. 4A). As the amount of CITED2 plasmid increased, there was a significant increase in both the exogenous ligand-dependent and -independent PPARα activity. When examining the effects of CITED2 on the dose-response relationship for PPARα activation by a potent ligand (Wy-14,643, Fig. 4B) there was an increase in activity for all doses. The EC50 value was not significantly changed by CITED2 overexpression, indicating that ligand affinity was not affected. The potential coactivating ability of CITED2 was also tested with PPARβ and PPARγ using the chimeric reporter system (pM-PPARβ and pM-PPARγ). As shown in Fig. 5A, CITED2 acted as a strong coactivator of pM-PPARγ basal and ligand-induced activity, while pM-PPARβ was unaffected in the absence of exogenous ligand and was slightly repressed by CIT-ED2 in the presence of ligand. The enhancement of pM-PPARγ activity by CITED2 alone (Me2SO-treated) was not further increased by adding the ligand prostaglandin J2. Cotransfecting HepG2 cells with a PPRE-driven reporter and pBK/PPARα, -β, or -γ resulted in a similar subtype difference in the ability of CITED2 to regulate gene expression (Fig. 5B). Overexpressing CITED2 increased the ligand-inducible PPRE-reporter activity of PPARα and PPARγ while having no effect on PPARβ. The ability of CITED2 to affect PPARγ activity is currently being explored and will not be discussed in the present report. Effects of CITED2 on PPARα Ligand Responses in Hepatocytes—Since CITED2 is able to affect multiple transcriptions factors, including PPARα and PPARγ in cell culture, whether these proteins are coexpressed in tissues was of interest. Analysis of total RNA from 10 different mouse tissues revealed that CITED2 mRNA was ubiquitously expressed with detectable levels in all tissues tested (Fig. 6). The MuSH cell line (13Tien E.S. Gray J.P. Peters J.M. Vanden Heuvel J.P. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5767-5780Google Scholar) and 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes also expressed relatively high levels of CITED2 mRNA (data not shown). Thus, CITED2 is found in tissues that express PPARα and PPARγ. Undifferentiated 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were transiently transfected with a construct expressing a double-stranded RNA molecule to target CITED2 for selective inhibition (RNAi). Also included in the transfection were pM-PPARα and GAL4 reporter vectors. Subsequently the cells were treated with PPARα ligands and assayed for luciferase activity. As shown in Fig. 7, cells expressing reduced levels of CITED2 were less responsive to Wy-14,643 activation of PPARα. In addition, the basal level of PPARα activity was reduced in the presence of the CITED2 RNAi plasmid. Due to low transfection efficiency, to examine the effects of manipulated CITED2 protein levels on endogenous gene expression, it was necessary to generate cells that harbor a stable inhibition or overexpression of CITED2. Mouse immortalized hepatocytes were stably transfected with CITED2 RNAi (CIT-ED2–) or CITED2 cDNA (CITED2+). Control lines were also created using empty plasmids for either CITED2 construct. The relative levels of CITED2 protein were examined via Western blot (Fig. 8A). The CITED2+ cells contained ∼1.5-fold the amount of this protein compared with their control counterparts (pcDNA3), while the CITED2–cells expressed 3-fold less than their control cells (pSuper). As shown in Fig. 8B, modulating CITED2 expression in these cells altered their growth rate. When MuSH cells stably transfected with empty vector were treated with Wy-14,643, there was an increase in the number of viable cells relative to comparable Me2SO-treated cells. This Wy-14,643-mediated augmentation in cell number was slightly increased in the CITED2+ cells and decreased in the CITED2–cells. Interestingly, when compared with pcDNA3 stably transfected cells, CITED2+ hepatocytes grew at a faster rate (5 times the number of cells after a 2-day period) in the absence of PPARα ligand. The effects of altered CITED2 expression on endogenous gene expression was examined (Fig. 9). The genes examined using real time PCR are shown in Table I and were chosen based on previous knowledge regarding PPARα and CITED2 or were identified in gene expression microarrays (see below). Two statistical comparisons were made in these studies. To determine a ligand-dependent regulation (Fig. 9, A–E), Me2SO-treated cells were compared with the same cell line treated with a PPARα ligand. To examine CITED2-dependent effects (Fig. 9, F–J), the control cell line was compared with either CITED2– or CITED2+ within the same treatment group. Angiopoietin-like protein 4 (Angptl4) mRNA was increased by Wy-14,643 and CLA in both control cell lines but most dramatically by CLA (Fig. 9A). In both the CITED2+ and CITED2–cell lines, induction of Angplt4 mRNA was lost in response to Wy-14,643 and ciprofibrate, while the effects of CLA were not significantly altered. A significant difference in Angptl4 mRNA levels was seen comparing Wy-14,643-treated CITED2+ cells to their control cell line (Fig. 9F). HIF1α mRNA was decreased by Wy-14,643 in the CITED2+ hepatocytes (Fig. 9B), whereas CLA- and ciprofibrate-treated CITED2–cells contained less HIF1α mRNA than comparably treated pSuper cells (Fig. 9G). FOXc2 mRNA was increased by Wy-14,643 in both control cell lines and in the CITED2–cells but not in the CITED2+ cells (Fig. 9C). Relative to pcDNA3, CITED2+ cells treated with ciprofibrate had increased FOXc2 mRNA concentration (Fig. 9H). As shown in Fig. 9D, MAPK phosphatase 1 (MKP-1) mRNA was increased by CLA in pcDNA3, CITED2+, and pSuper cells but not CI"
https://openalex.org/W2120793026,"Chromosomal loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is a common mechanism for the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes in human epithelial cancers. Hybridization to single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays is an efficient method to detect genome-wide cancer LOH. Here, we survey LOH patterns in a panel of 33 human lung cancer cell lines using SNP array hybridization containing 1500 SNPs. We compared the LOH patterns generated by SNP array hybridization to those previously obtained by 399 microsatellite markers and find a high degree of concordance between the two methods. A novel informatics platform, dChipSNP, was used to perform hierarchical tumor clustering based on genome-wide LOH patterns. We demonstrate that this method can separate non-small-cell and small-cell lung cancer samples based on their shared LOH. Furthermore, we analysed seven human lung cancer cell lines using a novel 10 000 SNP array and demonstrate that this is an efficient and reliable method of high-density allelotyping. Using this array, we identified small regions of LOH that were not detected by lower density SNP arrays or by standard microsatellite marker panels."
https://openalex.org/W2106705679,"Aralar1 and citrin were identified as calcium binding aspartate/glutamate carriers (AGC) in mitochondria. The presence of calcium binding motifs facing the extramitochondrial space allows the regulation of the transport activity of these carriers by cytosolic calcium and provides a new mechanism to transduce calcium signals in mitochondria without the requirement of calcium entry in the organelle. We now report the complete characterization of a second subfamily of human calcium binding mitochondrial carriers named SCaMC (short calcium-binding mitochondrial carriers). We have identified three SCaMC genes in the human genome. All code for highly conserved proteins (about 70-80% identity), of about 500 amino acids with a characteristic mitochondrial carrier domain at the C terminus, and an N-terminal extension harboring four EF-hand binding motifs with high similarity to calmodulin. All SCaMC proteins were found to be located exclusively in mitochondria, and their N-terminal extensions were dispensable for the correct mitochondrial targeting of the polypeptides. SCaMC-1 is the human orthologue of the rabbit Efinal protein, which was reported to be located in peroxisomes, and SCaMC-2 is the human orthologue of the rat MCSC protein, described as up-regulated by dexamethasone in AR42J cells. One of the SCaMC genes, SCaMC-2, has four variants generated by alternative splicing, resulting in proteins with a common C terminus but with variations in their N-terminal halves, including the loss of one to three EF-hand motifs. These results make SCaMC one of most complex subfamilies of mitochondrial carriers and suggest that the large number of isoforms and splice variants may confer different calcium sensitivity to the transport activity of these carriers.

A large number of proteins with the characteristic features of the MC family have emerged from genome sequencing of various organisms (4Palmieri F. Pflugers Arch.-Eur. J.

Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 443-453Google Scholar). MC members are integral proteins of the mitochondrial inner membrane, and function in the shuttling of metabolites, nucleotides, and cofactors between the cytosol and mitochondria. These proteins have a molecular mass of about 35 kDa, contain six transmembrane spanning segments, and have a tripartite structure (2Walker J.E. Runswick M.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 4: 35-46Google Scholar, 8Aquila H. Link T.A. Klingenberg M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2369-2376Google Scholar). Members of this family are responsible for the transport of ADP/ATP, phosphate, citrate, fumarate/succinate, carnitine/acylcarnitine, aspartate/glutamate, flavine adenine dinucleotide (FAD), and other substrates (9Indiveri C.

We have recently identified a subfamily of calcium-binding mitochondrial carriers (CaMCs) (15del Arco A. Satrustegui J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23327-23334Google Scholar, 16del Arco A. Agudo M. Satrustegui J. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 725-732Google Scholar) with a bipartite structure: the N-terminal half harbors EF-hand calcium binding motifs, whereas the C-terminal half has the characteristic features of the MC family. The CaMC subfamily is made up of two groups of proteins that differ in their MC homology sequences and in the length of their polypeptides (16del Arco A. Agudo M. Satrustegui J. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 725-732Google Scholar). The longer CaMCs are aralar1 and citrin, two isoforms of aspartate/glutamate carrier (AGC) important in the malate-aspartate NADH shuttle and the urea cycle (15del Arco A. Satrustegui J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23327-23334Google Scholar, 16del Arco A. Agudo M. Satrustegui J. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 725-732Google Scholar, 17Kobayashi K. Sinasac D.S. Iijima M. Boright A.P. Begum L. Lee J.R.

The AGC isoforms are activated by calcium on the external face of the inner mitochondrial membrane, suggesting a novel mechanism whereby cytoplasmic Ca2+ signals are decoded by mitochondria into activation of mitochondrial metabolism (18Palmieri L.

A second group of CaMCs, related to the product of yeast YNL083w gene, have shorter N-terminal regions, hence the name of SCaMCs (for short CaMC) used to design the members of this group (16del Arco A.

Makita N. Iiri T. Omata M. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9520-9527Google Scholar). Our working hypothesis is that SCaMCs may be calcium-regulated transporters in mitochondria important in calcium sensing by these organelles. The calcium uniporter is the main pathway whereby mitochondria decode cytosolic calcium signals into mitochondrial activation events, after allowing the entry of calcium in the organelle. In addition, there are other calcium sensors in mitochondria, such as that involved in facilitation of the calcium uniporter, that are responsible for its sustained activation (23Csordás G. Hajnóczky G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42273-42282Google Scholar), the activation of the permeability transition (24Bernardi P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 5-9Google Scholar), or the activation of the Ca2+-regulated ATPMg/Pi carrier (25Aprille J.R. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2547-2556Google Scholar, 26Nosek M.T. Dransfield D.T. Aprille J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8444-8450Google Scholar). These await identification. In the present work, we report the complete characterization of the human SCaMC genes. We have identified three SCaMC genes in the human genome. All code for highly conserved proteins with a characteristic MC domain and an N-terminal extension very similar to calmodulin, and all were found to be located exclusively in mitochondria. One of the SCaMC genes, SCaMC-2, has four variants generated by alternative splicing, making SCaMC one of most complex subfamilies of MCs. The BLAST homology searches were performed with the available web-based programs of the National Center for Biotechnology Information at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. DNA and protein sequence alignments were also carried out using the ClustalW program of the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI, www.ebi.ac.uk). The percentages of identical and similar amino acids were calculated using the program Blastp. Chromosomal location, intron-exon boundaries, and homology scores were assigned by comparing cDNA sequences with those deposited in GenBank™ using BLASTs programs. Oryza sativa sequences were obtained of the TIGR Rice Genome Project. Multiple alignment outputs were colored with BOXSHADE 3.21 (www.ch.embnet.org) or the Belvu program (www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/help/belvu_setup.shtml). Total RNAs were extracted from different cell lines by the guanidinium thiocyanate method. First strand cDNA was synthesized by using 5 μg of total RNA obtained from different cell lines as template, 100 ng of oligo(dT) primer (Roche Applied Science), or 20 pmol of specific reverse oligonucleotides (Isogen Bioscience BV) and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). Usually, 2-5% of the yield from first strand cDNA synthesis was used as template for subsequent PCR amplifications using TaqDNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Unless otherwise stated, conditions for PCR amplification were: 35 cycles with 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1 min 30 s at 72 °C, and a last cycle of elongation at 72 °C for 10 min. Blunt-ended fragments were purified and ligated into the PCR-cloning vector pST-Blue-1 (Novagen). The nucleotide sequences were determined using ABI prism dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). SCaMC-1—A partial SCaMC-1 sequence was obtained from human EST AA001086 (purchased from ATCC). To obtain 5′-end sequences, a human heart LambdaZap cDNA library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was screened using as probe the 2.3-kb NotI-EcoRI insert contained in AA001086 as described previously (15del Arco A. Satrustegui J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23327-23334Google Scholar). Only one positive clone, p3, containing sequences upstream of the AA001086 5′-end was purified and sequenced (encompassing nucleotides 687-1357 of final assembled SCaMC-1 sequence). Complete 5′-end extension was carried out by RT-PCR from HEK-293T total RNA. cDNA synthesis was performed with oligo(dT) (Roche Applied Science), and PCR amplification was realized using as forward primer, 5′-TCTGGGACCATGTTGCGCTG-3′ (designed according to the sequence of XM_001285), and as reverse primer, 5′-TGCCTGCATAAGGTATGATACC-3′ (complementary to nucleotides 401-380 of p3). The PCR product, of 1087 bp, was analyzed and joined to p3 and AA001086 sequences to assemble a full-length SCaMC-1 cDNA of 3290 bp (accession number AJ619987). SCaMC-2a—SCaMC-2a sequence (nucleotides from 1097 to 3240) was obtained after sequencing EST H42187 (purchased from ATCC). The 5′-end extension of H42187 sequence was performed by means of two consecutive overlapping RT-PCR amplifications from HEK-293T total RNA. Initial reverse transcription was performed with a specific primer 42-4 (5′-TTCACTGCTTAGTGCTGCAG-3′, complementary to nucleotides 26-7 of H42187). PCR was carried out using as reverse primer 42-4 and as forward primer (5′-ACGAGTGGAGAGACTACCAC-3′, based on EST AW614226 sequence) obtaining a 703-bp fragment. The amplified product was cloned into pSTBlue-1, H42.6 clone, and sequenced. A second 5′-fragment, overlapping H42.6, was obtained using as primer for first strand cDNA synthesis, 42-9 (5′-ACTGTGAACTCATCCGGGAC-3′, complementary to nucleotides 124-105 of H42.6). PCR was then performed with a forward primer, 42 (5′-CGCCAACATGCTCTGTCTGTGC-3′, from the 5′-end of AW614226), and a reverse primer, 42-7 (5′-ACCGTTAGATTCTCACCCACA-3′, nucleotides 106-86 of H42.6). Finally, the overlapping cloned PCR fragments were digested with AvaI, an internal restriction site of the common region, and fused (see Fig. 2 for approximate primer locations). The cloned 5′-region was fused to the H42187 insert to obtain a 3240-bp full-length coding region (accession number AJ619989). To this end, both fragments were digested in EcoRI flanking sites and in a common PstI site and subcloned into pUC-18, which was EcoRI-digested to produce pUC18-SCaMC-2. The SCaMC-2 5′-end variants were also obtained by RT-PCR. For SCaMC-2b, reverse transcription was performed with antisense primer 42-9. Then, for PCR amplification, the reverse primer used was 42-7 and the forward one was 42b (5′-CCTGTGTGTCAACGACCTGG-3′, based on EST AL523261 sequence). The 5′-end of exon 1b was amplified using 0.5 μg of human genomic DNA as template. The PCR reaction was performed in 10% Me2SO to amplify CG-rich sequences. The primers used were forward (5′-CCGATGGTGAGCAGTGTGTTG-3′) and reverse (5′-TCGGTGCGGTGCAGTCCCAG-3′, from EST AL523261). The fragments obtained of 426 and 251 bp, respectively, were digested in an overlapping NarI site, purified, and fused together into pUC18 cloning vector. To obtain the 5′-end of SCaMC-2c, human astrocytoma U87-MG total RNA was used for reverse transcription and 42-9 as reverse primer. The primers for PCR reactions were antisense 42-7 primer and sense 42c (5′-GACCGTGATGTTGCAGATGC-3′, according to human KIAA1896 protein sequence, accession number XM_0277668). The clones containing specific 5′-end isoforms were double-digested in an internal AvaI site (located in the common SCaMC-2 sequence) and in EcoRI flanking sites, the inserts obtained were ligated with AvaI-EcoRI fragment of pUC18-SCaMC-2 to produce pUC18-SCaMC-2b (accession number AJ619990) and pUC18-SCaMC-2c (accession number AJ619991). SCaMC-3—A partial human SCaMC-3 sequence (nucleotides from 1 to 1329) was obtained after sequencing human EST AI073878 (1435 bp, obtained from ATCC). SCaMC-3 3′-end sequence was amplified by RT-PCR from total RNA of HEK-293T cells. Reverse transcription was performed with oligo(dT) (Roche Applied Science) as primer. For PCR reactions a forward primer (5′-AGCAGTACAGCCACGACTCG-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 1202-1220 of AI073878) and a reverse primer (5′-GGGATCCTGTGGTTGGATCA-3′, derived from human EST BF920631 sequence) were used. The 394-bp product obtained was cloned and sequenced. Finally, after digestion at a KpnI site, located in the overlapping regions of AI073878 and the PCR product 3′-end, and flanking EcoRI sites, a full-length coding region was assembled into pBluescript-SK, thus obtaining a final cDNA of 1594 bp (accession number AJ619988). Antibodies against the N-terminal extensions of each human SCaMC isoform were generated as follows. Expression constructs encoding fusion proteins with a 6-histidine tag at the N terminus of human SCaMCs were made by subcloning 5′-ends of SCaMC-1, -3, and -2b isoforms into pQE vectors (Qiagen). Overexpressed sequences corresponded to amino acids 8-184 (SCaMC-1), 5-189 (SCaMC-3), and 1-206 for variant SCaMC-2b (amino acids 87-206 in this sequence are common for variants SCaMC-2a and -2c). Procedures for overexpression and purification of recombinant proteins were as described previously (15del Arco A. Satrustegui J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23327-23334Google Scholar). A human multiple tissue Northern blot containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA per lane was purchased from Clontech. Northern blot analysis was done using nick-translated [α-32P]dCTP-labeled specific-probes for human SCaMC-1 gene (2.3-kb NotI-EcoRI insert contained in AA001086), SCaMC-2 (a 2.15-kb NotI-EcoRI fragment from H42187, which detects all SCaMC-2 variants), and SCaMC-3 (a 1.4-kb fragment NotI-EcoRI from AI073878). An EcoRI-PstI fragment specific for SCaMC-2c, containing exclusively exon 1c sequences (corresponding to nucleotides 1-211 of SCaMC-2c) was also used. Hybridization was carried out for 16 h in a buffer containing 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 50% formamide, 0.1% SDS, and 200 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA at 42 °C. The blot was washed under conditions of high stringency, at 65 °C in a buffer containing 1× SSC, 0.2% SDS for 30 min and with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min. It was then stripped in 0.1% SDS at 100 °C for 30 min and consecutively rehybridized, under identical conditions, with each SCaMC probe as well as with a rat α-actin as control. Tissue distribution of SCaMC-2 variants was determined by PCR in a multiple tissue cDNA panel (BD Biosciences Clontech). An aliquot of each tissue cDNA was amplified using specific forward primers; primer 42-15 (5′-TCCACCTACCGCCAGTGGAAG-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 139-159 of SCaMC-2a), for SCaMC-2a, and primer 42b (nucleotide position 195-214 of SCaMC-2b) for SCaMC-2b variant. Primer 42-7, complementary to sequences in the common exon 5, was used as the reverse primer. A pair of specific human β-actin primers, forward 5′-GCATGGAGTCCTGTGGCATCCACG-3′ and reverse 5′-GGGTGTAACGCAACTAAGTCATAG-3′, which amplify a 355-bp product, were used for normalization. The templates were amplified under the conditions described above. For β-actin levels, 28 cycles of amplification were carried out, and 35 cycles for SCaMC-2 variants. PCR products were electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide. Also, the amplified products were cloned into pSTblue-1 vector (Novagen) and sequenced. An 8-amino acid FLAG epitope tag (peptide DYKDDDDK) was introduced at the C terminus immediately preceding the termination codon as described (15del Arco A. Satrustegui J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23327-23334Google Scholar, 16del Arco A. Agudo M. Satrustegui J. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 725-732Google Scholar). These modified 3′-fragments encoding C terminus FLAG-tagged forms of human SCaMC variants were confirmed by sequencing and inserted into assembled cDNAs by means of the use of appropriate endonucleases restriction sites. The complete cDNAs modified at the C terminus were cloned into the bicistronic expression vector pIRES1 (Clontech) BamHI-digested to obtain pIRESSCaMC-2aFLAG (also -2bFLAG, -2cFLAG, and -2dFLAG) and pIRESSCaMC-3FLAG. For SCaMC-1 expression a partial cDNA encoding amino acids 8-464 was obtained. PCR amplification was performed using as forward primer, 5′-AACATGGGCTTCGTGCTGCCCACCGCG-3′ (nucleotides 28-48 of SCaMC-1) containing an additional upstream ATG codon, and as reverse primer, 5′-TATTTTCATAACCACATAACTG-3′ (complementary to nucleotides 1411-1389). Both primers were designed according to the AF123303 sequence. The amplified partial cDNA was tagged at the C terminus with FLAG epitope obtaining finally pIRES-SCaMC-1(8-464)FLAG. To express carboxyl-truncated version of SCaMC (CT-SCaMC) cDNA fragments were generated by PCR with forward primers containing new initiation codons and reverse primer FLAG2 5′-AATTCTCACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTC-3′, complementary to that encoding FLAG epitope sequence. The following forward primers were used: to obtain CT-SCaMC-1FLAG (amino acids 175-464), 5′-TACCATGGAAATTATCCGTTTCTGGA-3′ (nucleotides 490-508, containing a new initiation codon (underlined) and additional nucleotides according to rules for consensus for translational initiation (27Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Google Scholar)); for CT-SCaMC-2FLAG (amino acids 153-469 in SCaMC-2a), 5′-TACCATGGAAAACATCCCCGAGATC-3′ (nucleotides 446-465 of SCaMC-2a); and for CTSCaMC-3 (amino acids 151-468), 5′-TACCATGGAGGACGTGCTGTATTCTT-3′ (nucleotides 558-574 of SCaMC-3). The templates were the expression constructs pIRES-SCaMC-1(8-464)FLAG, pIRES-SCaMC-2aFLAG, and pIRES-SCaMC-3FLAG. The blunted-PCR fragments were cloned into pSTBlue-1 vector and verified by sequencing. Inserts were obtained by means of digestion in EcoRI sites flanking the cloning site and were subcloned into the pCMV5 expression vector EcoRI-digested, to obtain finally pCMV5-CT-SCaMC-1FLAG, pCMV5-CT-SCaMC-2FLAG, and pCMV5-CT-SCaMC-3FLAG. To obtain the 5′-deletion construct, SCaMC-2ΔFLAG, a blunted fragment was obtained from pIRES-SCaMC-2dFLAG by double digestion with EcoRV (located at position 384-390 of SCaMC-2d cDNA) and SmaI (in flanking 3′-sequence) and then subcloned into SmaI-digested pCMV5 to obtain pCMV5-SCaMC-2ΔFLAG. COS-7, HEK-293T, SH-SY-5Y (neuroblastoma), U87-MG (astrocytoma), clone 9 (a rat liver cell line), and INS-1 (rat insulinoma) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (or 5% in COS-7 and HEK-293) inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a 7% CO2 atmosphere. RAW-264 cell line was maintained in RPMI medium 1640 supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. For transfections, COS-7 and HEK-293T cells were grown in 6-cm dishes and transiently transfected using the LipofectAMINE reagent (3 μl/μg of DNA) (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. 6 μg of reporter plasmid were used per dish. Cells were incubated with LipofectAMINE-DNA complexes for 6 h, and then the media was replaced with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. After 16-36 h of incubation to allow expression, cells were harvested for Western analysis. For immunofluorescence assays, cells were grown over coverslips, transfected, and, after 36 h, fixed and processed for fluorescence microscopy. For the study of mitochondrial location, living cells were incubated with MitoTracker Red CMXRos (200 nm, 30 min, Molecular Probes) at 37 °C, and washed in prewarmed PBS. MitoTracker-loaded cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (4 min, 4 °C) and 100% methanol (-20 °C, 3 min) rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with NaBH4 1 mg/ml in PBS for 10 min. Cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min and then blocked in PBS/1% BSA for 1 h. Incubation with primary antibody (anti-FLAG M2 antibody diluted 1:100, Sigma) in blocking medium was carried out at room temperature for 1 h. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated for 30 min with secondary antibody, FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:100 dilution in blocking medium, Sigma). To detect by immunofluorescence the endogenous SCaMC-1 protein, cells were processed as described above, and the primary and secondary antibodies used were an antibody against the N terminus of human SCaMC-1 (1:200), and an FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit (Alexa) antibody (1:500) both in PBS/1% BSA. Cells were washed three times with PBS, and the coverslips were mounted using Mowiol. Fluorescence microscopy was performed using an Axiovert epifluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss) at a nominal magnification of ×100. Mitochondrial-enriched fractions were obtained from cells as described (28del Arco A. Morcillo J. Martinez-Morales J.R. Galian C. Martos V. Bovolenta P. Satrustegui J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3313-3320Google Scholar) and analyzed by Western blotting using and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Amersham Biosciences). Anti-FLAG M2 antibody was used at 1:3,000 and secondary horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse antibody at 1:1,000 (Bio-Rad). Rabbit serum against the N terminus of human SCaMC-1 was used at a dilution of 1:2,000, and antibodies against the N terminus of SCaMC-2b and SCaMC-3 were used at 1:1,000. To control for the amount of mitochondrial protein loaded, blots were stripped and incubated with an antibody to the mitochondrial protein β-F1ATPase (a gift from the J. M. Cuezva laboratory, Centro de Biología Molecular Severo Ochoa) at a dilution of 1:5,000. Goat peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit antibody, 1:10,000, was from Bio-Rad. Identification of Human SCaMC Proteins—With the purpose of finding human SCaMC proteins, we performed TBLASTN searches in public databases using Efinal protein as query, a protein of 475 amino acids previously described in rabbit (11Weber F.E. Minestrini G. Dyer J.H. Werder M. Boffelli D. Compassi S. Wehrli E. Thomas R.M. Schulthess G. Hauser H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8509-8514Google Scholar, GenBank™ accession number AAB69156). By means of this approach we have identified several human ESTs homologous to the rabbit sequence. These sequences did not display complete identity, suggesting the existence of, at least, three human proteins homologous to Efinal. Fig. 1 shows the strategy used for cloning these human cDNAs (Fig. 1A), and the homology among the human ESTs found and between these and Efinal (Fig. 1B). These new genes have been named SCaMC-1, -2a, and -3. SCaMC-1—We found two EST clones, AA001086 and H42187, with homology of about 70-80% at the nucleotide level, and coding for amino acid sequences 96 and 67% identical to Efinal (11Weber F.E. Minestrini G. Dyer J.H. Werder M. Boffelli D. Compassi S. Wehrli E. Thomas R.M. Schulthess G. Hauser H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8509-8514Google Scholar), respectively, indicating that they encoded different Efinal-related proteins. These ESTs contained partial cDNAs sequences, both providing the 3′-ends and poly(A+) tails, with predicted sequences matching the C-terminal 200 amino acids of Efinal (Fig. 1A). To obtain the complete cDNAs, the inserts from both ESTs were used as probes in a hybridization screening using a human heart cDNA library (λZap, Clontech). A single clone was obtained, corresponding to AA001086 with upstream sequences going up to amino acid at position 227 of Efinal. A further inspection of databases revealed partial cDNAs that contained frame-shifts but provided the 5′-region, including the start codon (accession number AF123303 and XM_001285) of the cDNA. This 5′-end sequence was verified by RT-PCR using total RNA from human HEK-293T cells as template and sequencing of the PCR product (see “Materials and Methods” for primers used). The sequences were assembled in a full-length cDNA of 3290 bp (accession number AJ619987). This sequence belongs to UniGene cluster Hs.24713 and has been named SCaMC-1. The 477-amino acid long protein encoded by SCaMC-1 presents a remarkable homology (97% similarity and 95% identity), with the Oryctolagus cuniculus Efinal protein, suggesting that SCaMC-1 is the true human Efinal orthologue (see Fig. 1C). SCaMC-2a—SCaMC-2a was obtained as the cDNA corresponding to human EST H42187. To obtain the 5′-sequences of this cDNA, BLAST searches in the EST division of GenBank™ were carried out using H42187 and assembled SCaMC-1 sequences as query. Although we did not identify any EST overlapping the 5′-sequence of H42187, we initially found a"
https://openalex.org/W1979363808,"Genetic variation at the human LTA locus, encoding lymphotoxin-α, is associated with susceptibility to myocardial infarction, asthma and other diseases. By detailed haplotypic analysis of the locus, we identified a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at LTA+80 as a main predictor of LTA protein production by human B cells. We found that activated B-cell factor-1 (ABF-1) binds to this site in vitro and suppresses reporter gene expression, but only in the presence of the LTA+80A allele. Using haplotype-specific chromatin immunoprecipitation, we confirmed that ABF-1 is preferentially recruited to the low-producer allele in vivo. These findings provide a molecular model of how LTA expression may be genetically regulated by allele-specific recruitment of the transcriptional repressor ABF-1."

However, the precise intracellular mechanisms that regulate the DNA-binding activity of GATA-4 are not fully understood. The aim of the present study was to examine the role of mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38 kinase, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase, and c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase) in the left ventricular wall stress-induced activation of GATA-4 DNA binding in adult heart. Isolated perfused rat hearts were subjected to increased left ventricular wall stress by inflating a balloon in the ventricle. Gel mobility shift assays were used to analyze the transacting factors that interact with the GATA motifs of the B-type natriuretic peptide promoter. The left ventricular wall stress rapidly activated GATA-4 DNA binding and significantly increased the levels of phosphorylated p38 kinase, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase, and c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase. The wall stress-induced increase in the DNA-binding activity of GATA-4 was abolished both in the presence of the p38 inhibitor SB239063 and MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126. In contrast, the inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase by CEP11004 had no effect on the baseline or stretch-induced GATA-4 DNA binding. Moreover, GATA-4 DNA binding was up-regulated by mechanical stretch in the isolated rat atria via p38 and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase.

Myocardial hypertrophy is an adaptive process that develops as a response to hemodynamic overload and a number of different neurohumoral factors. Initially, hypertrophy is considered as a beneficial compensatory mechanism to increased workload, but when prolonged, it ultimately leads to deterioration of cardiac function and chronic heart failure (1Lorell B.H. Carabello B.A. Circulation. 2000; 102: 470-479Google Scholar). At the cellular level, the hypertrophic response is characterized by increase of the size of the myocytes, accumulation of cellular proteins and increased sarcomeric assembly of myofibrils (2Sugden P.H.

The nuclear signaling cascades that link the hypertrophic stimuli into the changes in cardiac gene expression and hypertrophic growth are not fully understood. GATA-4 is a member of the GATA family of zinc-finger transcription proteins and a critical regulator of cardiac cell growth, differentiation, and survival during the embryogenesis (4Kelley C.

De Windt L.J. Witt S.A. Kimball T.R. Markham B.E. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30245-30253Google Scholar). Furthermore, GATA-4 has been suggested to be a key regulator of the inducible cardiac gene expression (8Pikkarainen S. Tokola H. Majalahti-Palviainen T. Kerkelä R. Hautala N. Bhalla S.S. Charron F. Nemer M. Vuolteenaho O. Ruskoaho H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23807-23816Google Scholar, 9Liang Q. De Windt L.J. Witt S.A. Kimball T.R. Markham B.E. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol.

It has been shown that GATA-4 regulates the transcriptional activation of BNP, endothelin-1 (ET-1), β-myosin heavy chain, and angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor genes during pressure overload and hypertrophic process (10Liang Q. Molkentin J.D. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2002; 34: 611-616Google Scholar, 11Marttila M. Hautala N. Paradis P. Toth M. Vuolteenaho O. Nemer M. Ruskoaho H.

S. A. 1997; 94: 7543-7548Google Scholar). Moreover, we have recently shown that arginine-vasopressin-induced pressure overload in vivo and direct left ventricular wall stress in vitro result in an increased DNA-binding activity of GATA-4 (15Hautala N. Tokola H. Luodonpaa M. Puhakka J. Romppanen H. Vuolteenaho O. Ruskoaho H. Circulation. 2001; 103: 730-735Google Scholar, 16Hautala N. Tenhunen O. Szokodi I. Ruskoaho H. Pflugers Arch. 2002; 443: 362-369Google Scholar). However, there is no data available regarding the signaling mechanisms regulating the activation of GATA-4 DNA binding in the adult heart. The branches of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) pathway, the p38 kinase pathway and the c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) pathway, are known to regulate a wide array of cellular events by phosphorylation in response to extracellular stimuli (17Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to characterize the role of MAPK pathways in the regulation of left ventricular wall stress-induced GATA-4 binding by using isolated perfused rat hearts. Gel mobility shift assays were used to analyze the transacting factors that interact with the GATA motifs of the BNP promoter. The hearts were subjected to increased wall stress by inflating a balloon in the left ventricle. Moreover, the role of MAPK pathways in the stretch-induced GATA-4 binding was investigated in the isolated rat atria. Our results demonstrate that both p38 and ERK 1/2 play a crucial role in the regulation of wall stress-induced GATA-4 binding in intact heart.

Willette (GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals) and CEP11004 by Cephalon Inc., West Chester, PA. Bosentan was a gift from Dr. Martine Clozel (Actelion, Basel, Switzerland), and CV-11974 was from Dr. Hajime Toguchi (Takeda Chemical Industries Ltd., Osaka, Japan). SB203580 and PD98059 were obtained from LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA. Anti-phospho-p38 antibody was from Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA. Anti-phospho-p44/42, anti-p38, and anti-p44/42 antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Hitchin, Hertfordshire, UK; anti-GATA-4, anti-phospho-Elk-1, anti-phospho-JNK, and anti-JNK antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA. JNK Assay Kit was from Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA. Isolated Perfused Rat Heart Preparation—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 131), weighing 250-320 g, from the Center for Experimental Animals at the University of Oulu, were used. The experimental design was approved by the Animal Use and Care Committee of the University of Oulu, and it was similar to that described previously in detail (16Hautala N. Tenhunen O. Szokodi I. Ruskoaho H. Pflugers Arch. 2002; 443: 362-369Google Scholar, 18Schunkert H. Jahn L. Izumo S. Apstein C. Lorell B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11480-11484Google Scholar, 19Thienelt C.D. Weinberg E.O. Bartunek J. Lorell B.H. Circulation. 1997; 95: 2677-2683Google Scholar, 20Cornelius T. Holmer S.R. Muller F.U. Riegger G.A.J. Schunkert H. Hypertension. 1997; 30: 1348-1355Google Scholar, 21Schunkert H. Weinberg E.O. Bruckschlegel G. Riegger A.J. Lorell B.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2768-2774Google Scholar). Briefly, the rats were decapitated, the aorta was cannulated above the aortic valve, and the hearts were arranged for retrograde perfusion by the Langendorff technique. The hearts were perfused with modified Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.40) equilibrated with 95% O2-5% CO2 at 37 °C. The composition of the buffer was (in millimolar) 113.8 NaCl, 22.0 NaHCO3, 4.7 KCl, 1.2 KH2PO4, 1.1 MgSO4, 2.5 CaCl2, and 11.0 glucose. The coronary flow rate was set to 15 ml/min, and the heart rate was increased 15-20% above the spontaneous beating frequency. Perfusion pressure, reflecting coronary vascular resistance, was measured by a pressure transducer (Isotec, Hugo Sachs Elektronik, Germany) situated on a side arm of the aortic cannula. A fluid-filled balloon connected to the pressure transducer (Isotec) was inserted through the mitral valve to the left ventricle to measure the ventricular pressure. Initially, the hearts were unloaded by opening the valve of the cannula of the intraventricular balloon against the air so that the balloon was inflated just enough to obtain a pressure signal to monitor preparation stability, and perfused under these conditions for 20 min. After the 20-min period of equilibration the hearts were exposed within 5 min to a peak systolic pressure of between 130 and 150 mmHg by closing the valve and inflating the balloon for 10 min, 30 min, or 2 h. The end-diastolic pressure was set to a level of between 20 and 25 mmHg to maximize the active pressure generation and systolic pressure. In the control groups, the perfusion was continued further under the unloaded conditions. The drugs or the vehicle were added into the aortic cannula as a continuous infusion in the absence and presence of increased wall stress. At the end of the experiments, the left ventricles were immersed in liquid nitrogen and stored in -70 °C until assayed. Calculation of Wall Stress—Peak systolic circumferential wall stress (σ) was derived from ventricular pressure measurements, intraventricular balloon volume (VB) and the weight of the left ventricle, as described by Strömer et al. (22Strömer H. Cittadini A. Szymanska G. Apstein C.S. Morgan J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H501-H510Google Scholar). Briefly, a spherical model was assumed in which the radius of the left ventricle (Ri) can be calculated by the cubic formula, Ri=3√VB/[(4/3)⋅π]. Total left ventricular volume is the sum of VB and volume of the left ventricular wall (VWall = left ventricular weight/1.05 (specific gravity of myocardium)). Therefore, VB + VWall = (4/3) · π · (Ri + h)3, and h={3√(VB+VWall)/[(4/3)⋅π]}−Ri, where h = thickness of the left ventricular wall. Left ventricular circumferential wall stress was then derived from Laplace's law, σ=P⋅[(Ri2/h)/(2Ri+h)], where P = peak systolic pressure. Isolated Rat Atria Preparation—In another set of experiments, the isolated rat atrial appendix, prepared as described previously, was used (23Tavi P. Han C. Weckstrom M. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 1165-1177Google Scholar). Briefly, the rats were decapitated and their hearts were rapidly removed and placed in oxygenated cool (25 °C) buffer solution consisting of (in mm) NaCl 137, KCl 5.6, CaCl2 2.2, HEPES 5.0, MgCl2 1.2, and glucose 2.5 (pH 7.4), which was also used for superfusion of the atrial preparation. An X-branch polyethylene adapter was inserted into the lumen of the left auricle, and the tissue was placed in a constant temperature (37 °C) organ bath. Another tube with smaller diameter was inserted inside the adapter to carry perfusate inflow into the lumen of the auricle. The outflow from the lumen came from one cross-branch of the X-cannula. The stretch of the atrium was produced by changing intra-atrial pressure. Pressure inside the atrium was increased by increasing the height of the outflow tube. The other cross-branch of the X-cannula was connected to a pressure transducer (TCB 100, Millar Instruments, Inc.) so that the pressure in the lumen of the auricle could be recorded. Inflow and outflow (3 ml/min) both to the auricle lumen and to the organ bath with constant temperature were controlled by a peristaltic pump (7553-85, Cole-Parmer Instrument Co.). Extraction of Nuclear Protein and Gel Mobility Shift Assays—Nuclear extracts were prepared from the left ventricular tissue as previously described (15Hautala N. Tokola H. Luodonpaa M. Puhakka J. Romppanen H. Vuolteenaho O. Ruskoaho H. Circulation. 2001; 103: 730-735Google Scholar, 16Hautala N. Tenhunen O. Szokodi I. Ruskoaho H. Pflugers Arch. 2002; 443: 362-369Google Scholar). The tissue was broken in liquid nitrogen and homogenized in a low salt solution (0.6% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate), and the nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in a high salt solution (25% glycerol, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mmol EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 2 mm benzamidine, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin) and centrifuged. The supernatant was aliquoted, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored in -70 °C until assayed. Protein concentrations were determined by Bio-Rad Laboratories Protein Assay. Double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides containing GATA (5′-TGTGTCTGATAAATCAGAGATAACCCCACC-3′) motifs of the rat BNP promoter were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP. Binding reactions consisted of 40 μg of protein extract and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)(dI-dC) in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm/DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.025% Nonidet P-40, 0.25 mm PMSF, and 1 μm each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, and when appropriate, various molar excesses of competitor DNAs. Supershift experiments were performed by preincubating the nuclear extract with 1 μg of appropriate antibody for 20 min at room temperature before the binding reaction. The binding reactions were carried out at room temperature for 20 min. Protein-DNA complexes were separated by electrophoresis on 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × TBE (Tris borate-EDTA buffer) at 4 °C. The gels were dried and exposed with PhosphorImager screens (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA), which were scanned by using a Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad Laboratories). All results were quantitated by using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Western Blotting—The tissue was homogenized in lysis buffer containing of 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm benzamidine, 1 mm PMSF, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm DTT, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin. Western blots were performed using anti-GATA-4, anti-phospho-p38, anti-phospho-p44/42, anti-phospho-JNK, anti-p38, anti-p44/42, and anti-JNK antibodies, as previously described (24Kerkelä R. Pikkarainen S. Majalahti-Palviainen T. Tokola H. Ruskoaho H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13752-13760Google Scholar). Samples (30 μg) were loaded onto SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk and incubated with indicated primary antibody overnight. For a second Western blot, the membranes were stripped for 30 min in 60 °C in stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 100 mm mercaptoethanol). The levels of GATA-4, phospho-p38, total p38, phospho-ERK, total ERK, phospho-JNK, and total JNK were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Kinase Assays—p38 MAPK activity was determined with immunocomplex kinase assay by using Elk-1 as substrate. Cardiac tissue homogenates were clarified at 14,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were immunoprecipitated for 4 h with immobilized phospho-p38 antibody. The pellets were washed twice with a buffer, which consisted of 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, supplemented with 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 50 mm NaF. Then the pellets were washed once with kinase buffer consisting of 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm DTT, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mm MgCl2. Finally, the pellets were suspended in 40 μl of kinase buffer, including 200 μm ATP and 2 μg of Elk-1 fusion protein (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). The kinase reaction was conducted at +30 °C for 30 min and stopped by placing the samples on ice and adding 20 μl of 3 × SDS. Next the samples were boiled, microcentrifuged, and analyzed by Western blotting for phospho-Elk-1. An assay for measuring JNK activation was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cell Signaling Technology). Briefly, c-Jun fusion protein was used to pull down active JNK from clarified cardiac tissue homogenates. Pellet was washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer consisting of 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm DTT, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mm MgCl2. Finally, the pellet was suspended in 40 μl of kinase buffer, including 100 μm ATP, and the samples were incubated in 30 °C for 30 min. The kinase reaction was stopped by placing the samples on ice and adding 20 μl of 3 × SDS. Next the samples were boiled, microcentrifuged, and analyzed by Western blotting for phospho-c-Jun. RNA Extraction and Northern Blot Analysis—The RNA extraction and Northern blot analysis were performed as previously (8Pikkarainen S. Tokola H. Majalahti-Palviainen T. Kerkelä R. Hautala N. Bhalla S.S. Charron F. Nemer M. Vuolteenaho O. Ruskoaho H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23807-23816Google Scholar, 15Hautala N. Tokola H. Luodonpaa M. Puhakka J. Romppanen H. Vuolteenaho O. Ruskoaho H.

The RNA was extracted from the left ventricles using the guanidinethiocyanate-CsCl method. For the Northern blot analyses, 20-μg samples of RNA were separated by electrophoresis and transferred to nylon membranes (Osmonics, Westborough, MA). The cDNA probes complementary to rat GATA-4, BNP, c-fos, or ribosomal 18 S RNA were random prime-labeled, and the membranes were hybridized and washed 3 × 20′ at 62 °C. The results were detected and quantitated as the gel mobility shift assays. Statistical Analysis—The results are presented as mean ± S.E. The hemodynamic data were analyzed with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc test. The statistical significance between two groups was determined by using Student's t test. A protocol of one-way ANOVA followed by a least significant difference post hoc test were used for multivariate analysis. Correlation coefficients were calculated by linear regression analysis. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Hemodynamics and Gene Expression—To examine the stretch-induced activation of MAPKs and transcription factors in the left ventricle of adult heart, we applied an in vitro stretch model in isolated perfused rat hearts (18Schunkert H. Jahn L. Izumo S. Apstein C. Lorell B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11480-11484Google Scholar, 19Thienelt C.D. Weinberg E.O. Bartunek J. Lorell B.H. Circulation. 1997; 95: 2677-2683Google Scholar, 20Cornelius T. Holmer S.R. Muller F.U. Riegger G.A.J. Schunkert H. Hypertension. 1997; 30: 1348-1355Google Scholar, 21Schunkert H. Weinberg E.O. Bruckschlegel G. Riegger A.J. Lorell B.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2768-2774Google Scholar). In this experimental system, wall stress is imposed on isovolumetrically beating rat hearts by distension of a fluid filled balloon in the left ventricle, whereas the control hearts are perfused with flaccid balloons to minimize the left ventricular pressure generation. In the present experiments, the hearts were initially unloaded by opening the valve of the cannula of the intraventricular balloon against the air so the flaccid balloon was filled just enough to obtain a pressure signal (≈10 mmHg systolic pressure at an end-diastolic pressure of ≈0 mmHg) to monitor preparation stability. After the 20-min equilibration period the valve of the cannula was closed and the volume of the left ventricular balloon was increased within 5 min to reach the maximal point on the Frank-Starling curve, corresponding to a left ventricular systolic pressure of 135-150 mmHg at an enddiastolic pressure of 20-25 mmHg. Thereafter the hearts were perfused under these conditions for 10, 30, and 120 min. In the control groups, the perfusion was continued further under the unloaded conditions. The hemodynamic data are shown in Table I. The coronary perfusion pressure remained constant during the experimental period in all experimental groups. No significant differences were observed in the perfusion pressure, left ventricular systolic pressure, and end-diastolic pressure between the vehicle-infused group and drug-infused groups (Table I).Table IHemodynamic variables in isolated perfused rat heartsVehicleSB 239063U0126CEP11004Control (n = 14)Stretch (n = 13)Control (n = 6)Stretch (n = 6)Control (n = 6)Stretch (n = 7)Control (n = 5)Stretch (n = 5)Perfusion pressure (mmHg)Basal66 ± 268 ± 260 ± 159 ± 262 ± 260 ± 580 ± 578 ± 230 min67 ± 370 ± 261 ± 468 ± 268 ± 476 ± 786 ± 692 ± 9Developed pressure (mmHg)Basal7 ± 28 ± 18 ± 29 ± 210 ± 18 ± 18 ± 18 ± 130 min7 ± 2118 ± 28 ± 2110 ± 29 ± 1112 ± 28 ± 1124 ± 5End-diastolic pressure (mmHg)Basal2 ± 11 ± 10 ± 11 ± 10 ± 11 ± 13 ± 14 ± 130 min2 ± 123 ± 10 ± 123 ± 20 ± 125 ± 23 ± 124 ± 4Systolic pressure (mmHg)Basal9 ± 19 ± 19 ± 210 ± 210 ± 29 ± 111 ± 111 ± 130 min9 ± 1141 ± 39 ± 2135 ± 110 ± 1137 ± 411 ± 1148 ± 5Systolic wall stress (kdyn/cm2)30 min147 ± 4138 ± 2133 ± 4151 ± 6 Open table in a new tab To further validate the experimental system, we analyzed the effects of increased left ventricular wall stress on the expression of BNP and c-fos genes, which are known to be up-regulated during the hypertrophic process and during acute hemodynamic overload (2Sugden P.H. Clerk A. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 725-746Google Scholar, 3Chien K.R. Knowlton K.U. Zhu H. Chien S. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3037-3046Google Scholar). Previously, we have reported that a 4-h period of stretch in the cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes produced a 1.6-fold increase in the BNP gene expression, and infusion of angiotensin II in conscious animals resulted in a 2.2-fold increase in BNP mRNA levels at 2 h (8Pikkarainen S. Tokola H. Majalahti-Palviainen T. Kerkelä R. Hautala N. Bhalla S.S. Charron F. Nemer M. Vuolteenaho O. Ruskoaho H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23807-23816Google Scholar, 25Suo M. Hautala N. Földes G. Szokodi I. Toth M. Leskinen H. Uusimaa P. Vuolteenaho O. Nemer M. Ruskoaho H. Hypertension. 2002; 39: 803-808Google Scholar). In agreement with these studies, the increased ventricular wall stress for 2 h resulted in a 1.6-fold increase in BNP gene expression (Fig. 1A, p < 0.01 versus control, n = 6), whereas a 1-h period of stretch resulted in a 1.2-fold increase in the BNP gene expression (data not shown). We also observed a 3.0-fold increase in the c-fos gene expression (data not shown) at 1 h and and a 2.1-fold increase in c-fos gene expression (Fig. 1B, p < 0.01 versus control, n = 6) at 2 h. Consistently with these results, Cornelius et al. (20Cornelius T. Holmer S.R. Muller F.U. Riegger G.A.J. Schunkert H. Hypertension. 1997; 30: 1348-1355Google Scholar) have reported a 3.5-fold increase and Thienelt et al. (19Thienelt C.D. Weinberg E.O. Bartunek J. Lorell B.H. Circulation. 1997; 95: 2677-2683Google Scholar) a 2.1-fold increase in the c-fos gene expression after a 1-h wall stretch period by using similar experimental setup. Previously, it has also been reported that an acute increment of left ventricular wall stress activates c-fos and c-jun gene expression independently of passive diastolic stretch (18Schunkert H. Jahn L. Izumo S. Apstein C. Lorell B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11480-11484Google Scholar). In agreement with these findings, the left ventricular BNP mRNA levels correlated positively with the levels of developed pressure (r = 0.73, n = 10, p < 0.05), whereas there was no correlation between the BNP mRNA levels and levels of the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (r = -0.18, n = 10, p = NS). Taken together with the results of previous studies, the active generation of an acute increment in left ventricular systolic force generation is the major stimulus leading to the activation of gene expression and signal transduction pathways under these experimental conditions. Interestingly, Yamamoto et al. (26Yamamoto K. Dang Q.N. Maeda Y. Huang H. Kelly R.A. Lee R.T. Circulation. 2001; 103: 1459-1464Google Scholar) have shown that strain imposed on cultured myocytes during systolic phase stimulate ERK 1/2 phosphorylation and BNP gene expression more than the strain imposed during diastolic phase. Activation of p38 Kinase, ERK, and JNK by Increased Left Ventricular Wall Stress—The mitogen-activated protein kinases are known to be activated in the heart in response to numerous stimuli. To establish the wall stretch-induced activation of MAPKs under these experimental conditions, the hearts were exposed to increased left ventricular wall stress for 10 min, and Western blotting using phospho-p38-, phosphop44/p42-, and phospho-JNK-specific antibodies was performed. In agreement with a previous study in isolated guinea pig hearts (27Takeishi Y. Huang Q. Abe J. Glassman M. Che W. Lee J.D. Kawakatsu H. Lawrence E.G. Hoit B.D. Berk B.C. Walsh R.A. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2001; 33: 1637-1648Google Scholar), the left ventricular wall stretch for 10 min increased phospho-p38 levels (Fig. 2A, 2.3-fold versus control, p < 0.001) and phospho-ERK1/2 levels (Fig. 2B, 1.6-fold versus control, p < 0.05). Also the phospho-JNK levels were markedly increased (Fig. 2C, 1.9-fold versus control, p < 0.05), in contrast to the previous study (27Takeishi Y. Huang Q. Abe J. Glassman M. Che W. Lee J.D. Kawakatsu H. Lawrence E.G. Hoit B.D. Berk B.C. Walsh R.A. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2001; 33: 1637-1648Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2081188915,"We have quantitatively measured nitric oxide production in the leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana and Vicia faba by adapting ferrous dithiocarbamate spin tapping methods previously used in animal systems. Hydrophobic diethyldithiocarbamate complexes were used to measure NO interacting with membranes, and hydrophilic N-methyl-d-glucamine dithiocarbamate was used to measure NO released into the external solution. Both complexes were able to trap levels of NO, readily detectable by EPR spectroscopy. Basal rates of NO production (in the order of 1 nmol g–1 h–1) agreed with previous studies. However, use of methodologies that corrected for the removal of free NO by endogenously produced superoxide resulted in a significant increase in trapped NO (up to 18 nmol g–1 h–1). Basal NO production in leaves is therefore much higher than previously thought, but this is masked by significant superoxide production. The effects of nitrite (increased rate) and nitrate (decreased rate) are consistent with a role for nitrate reductase as the source of this basal NO production. However, rates under physiologically achievable nitrite concentrations never approach that reported following pathogen induction of plant nitric-oxide synthase. In Hibiscus rosa sinensis, the addition of exogenous nitrite generated sufficient NO such that EPR could be used to detect its production using endogenous spin traps (forming paramagnetic dinitrosyl iron complexes). Indeed the levels of this nitrosylated iron pool are sufficiently high that they may represent a method of maintaining bioavailable iron levels under conditions of iron starvation, thus explaining the previously observed role of NO in preventing chlorosis under these conditions. We have quantitatively measured nitric oxide production in the leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana and Vicia faba by adapting ferrous dithiocarbamate spin tapping methods previously used in animal systems. Hydrophobic diethyldithiocarbamate complexes were used to measure NO interacting with membranes, and hydrophilic N-methyl-d-glucamine dithiocarbamate was used to measure NO released into the external solution. Both complexes were able to trap levels of NO, readily detectable by EPR spectroscopy. Basal rates of NO production (in the order of 1 nmol g–1 h–1) agreed with previous studies. However, use of methodologies that corrected for the removal of free NO by endogenously produced superoxide resulted in a significant increase in trapped NO (up to 18 nmol g–1 h–1). Basal NO production in leaves is therefore much higher than previously thought, but this is masked by significant superoxide production. The effects of nitrite (increased rate) and nitrate (decreased rate) are consistent with a role for nitrate reductase as the source of this basal NO production. However, rates under physiologically achievable nitrite concentrations never approach that reported following pathogen induction of plant nitric-oxide synthase. In Hibiscus rosa sinensis, the addition of exogenous nitrite generated sufficient NO such that EPR could be used to detect its production using endogenous spin traps (forming paramagnetic dinitrosyl iron complexes). Indeed the levels of this nitrosylated iron pool are sufficiently high that they may represent a method of maintaining bioavailable iron levels under conditions of iron starvation, thus explaining the previously observed role of NO in preventing chlorosis under these conditions. The phenomenon of NO production by plants was first reported by Klepper in 1979 (1Klepper L. Pest. Biochem. Physiol. 1991; 39: 43-48Google Scholar), significantly earlier than the discovery of NO generation by animals (1985–1987). Nevertheless research in the plant NO field has lagged behind the animal field for two important reasons: the absence of a physiological phenomenon elicited by NO and a lack of understanding of the molecular mechanism underpinning any such phenomenon. In animals the role of NO as the endothelium-derived relaxing factor and the discovery of the l-arginine/ nitric-oxide synthase/guanylate cyclase signaling pathway (2Moncada S. Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142Google Scholar, 3Ignarro L.J. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1990; 67: 1-7Google Scholar) provided the impetus for the explosion of research in this area in the 1990s (4Alderton W.K. Cooper C.E. Knowles R.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 593-615Google Scholar). However, recently there has been a similar expansion of interest in the role of NO in plants. Although a complete molecular model of the physiological role of NO in plants remains to be determined, a number of normal physiological processes are now known to be modulated by NO production. These include: production of the hormone ethylene (5Leshem Y.Y. Wills R.B.H. Ku V.V.V. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1998; 36: 825-833Google Scholar), germination (6Beligni M.V. Lamattina L. Planta. 2000; 210: 215-221Google Scholar), programmed cell death (7Clarke A. Desikan R. Hurst R.D. Hancock J.T. Neill S.J. Plant J. 2000; 24: 667-677Google Scholar, 8Pedroso M.C. Magalhaes J.R. Durzan D. Plant Sci. 2000; 157: 173-180Google Scholar), senescence (5Leshem Y.Y. Wills R.B.H. Ku V.V.V. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1998; 36: 825-833Google Scholar), and stomatal closure (9Desikan R. Griffiths R. Hancock J. Neill S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16314-16318Google Scholar). NO is also involved in pathogen defense, either directly (10Delledonne M. Xia Y. Dixon R.A. Lamb C. Nature. 1998; 394: 585-588Google Scholar) or via production of antimicrobial phytoalexins (11Noritake T. Kawakita K. Doke N. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 113-116Google Scholar). There are several recent reviews covering the role of NO in plants (12Beligni M.V. Lamattina L. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 299-300Google Scholar, 13Beligni M.V. Lamattina L. Plant Cell Environ. 2001; 24: 267-278Google Scholar, 14Lamattina L. Garcia-Mata C. Graziano M. Pagnussat G. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2003; 54: 109-136Google Scholar, 15Neill S.J. Desikan R.

Although the molecular target eliciting the NO response has proved elusive, there has been considerable progress in identifying the enzymes that produce NO in vivo. A consensus has emerged that basal levels of NO production are controlled by the heme enzyme, nitrate reductase (NR). 1The abbreviations used are: NR, nitrate reductase; MNIC, mononitrosyl iron-complex; MNIC-DETC, mononitrosyl iron-DETC complex; DETC, diethyldithiocarbamate; MGD, N-methyl-d-glucamine dithiocarbamate; MNIC-MGD, mononitrosyl iron MGD complex; NO-Pr, NO-proline; DNIC, dinitrosyl iron complex; NOS, nitric-oxide synthase; Hb, hemoglobin.

Sakihama Y. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 89-92Google Scholar). This enzyme has a primary activity of converting nitrate to nitrite; however, it can also convert nitrite to NO, presumably via a single electron reduction similar to that occurring in the well characterized bacterial heme proteins (e.g. cd1) that catalyze nitrite reduction to NO as part of the nitrogen cycle (22Cutruzzola F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 231-249Google Scholar). The hypothesis that NR plays a significant role in NO generation in plants is supported by the recent finding that NO synthesis in plants is stimulated by nitrite, and this stimulation is attenuated in an Arabidopsis thaliana NR double mutant (at nia1 and nia2) that has a diminished NR activity (9Desikan R. Griffiths R. Hancock J. Neill S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16314-16318Google Scholar). Recently, however, two other enzyme systems have been characterized as being involved in plant NO synthesis. The first is induced in response to pathogens (23Chandok M.R. Jimmy Ytterberg A. van Wijk K.J. Klessig D.F. Cell. 2003; 113: 469-482Google Scholar). This enzyme, a variant of the P protein of the glycine decarboxylase complex, catalyzes similar chemistry to the mammalian nitric-oxide synthase (converting l-arginine to citrulline and NO) but has very little sequence homology with it. Thus, it has been difficult to detect via genome mining or antibody screening. The second new enzyme, AtNOS1, is involved in hormone signaling by NO and also converts arginine to citrulline (24Guo F.Q. Okamoto M. Crawford N.M. Science. 2003; 302: 100-103Google Scholar). It is also not homologous to mammalian NO synthases, although it shares many of their functional characteristics (including calcium activation and inhibitor sensitivity). Nitrogen oxides have a range of chemical reactivity, making difficult the quantitative analysis of their production, destruction, and physiological/pathophysiological effects in complex biological solutions. Yet without these hard numbers it becomes difficult to determine which of the wide range of NO chemical/biological activities are important physiologically. However, one advantage of the relatively late arrival of plant research into the nitric oxide field is that a number of methods for measuring NO have been optimized on mammalian systems (25Packer L. Methods in Enzymology. 269. Academic Press, San Diego, California1996Google Scholar, 26Packer L. Methods in Enzymology. 268. Academic Press, San Diego, California1996Google Scholar). Superoxide reacts with NO at a diffusion-controlled rate to produce peroxynitrite (27Koppenol W.H. Moreno J.J. Pryor W.A. Ischiropoulos H. Beckman J.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 834-842Google Scholar). One of the early indicators that free NO was involved in mammalian physiology was the finding that superoxide completely attenuated both endogenous (bradykinin) and exogenous nitric oxide-induced vessel relaxation (28Palmer R.M. Ferrige A.G. Moncada S. Nature. 1987; 327: 524-526Google Scholar, 29Gryglewski R.J. Palmer R.M. Moncada S. Nature. 1986; 320: 454-456Google Scholar). Because plants have the potential for very high rates of superoxide production (30Lamb C. Dixon R.A. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 251-275Google Scholar) both basally and, especially, in response to light or water stress (31Fryer M.J. Andrews J.R. Oxborough K. Blowers D.A. Baker N.R. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 571-580Google Scholar, 32Ort D.R. Baker N.R. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 193-198Google Scholar, 33Fryer M.J. Ball L. Oxborough K. Karpinski S. Mullineaux P.M. Baker N.R. Plant J. 2003; 33: 691-705Google Scholar), it is likely that this is the main obstacle in accurately measuring NO production rates. Our recent studies in animals have demonstrated that the addition of exogenous NO complexes of iron-dithiocarbamate complexes can compete with superoxide anions for NO molecules, ensuring a more quantitative formation (34Vanin A.F. Huisman A. Stroes E.S. de Ruijter-Heijstek F.C. Rabelink T.J. van Faassen E.E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 813-824Google Scholar) of the EPR-detectable mononitrosyl iron-dithiocarbamate complexes. This allows for a far more accurate measure of NO production in the system (35Vanin A.F. Huisman A. van Faassen E.E. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 359: 27-42Google Scholar). NO spin traps have not been extensively used in plant systems. The aim of the present study was to verify the efficiency of NO spin trapping as a method of quantitatively measuring NO production rates in plant leaves. The hydrophobic or hydrophilic ferrous-dithiocarbamate complexes, ferrous-DETC and ferrous-N-methyl-d-glucamine dithiocarbamate, were used respectively to monitor NO generation in cell membranes or to trap NO escaping from the cells to the medium. In agreement with suggestions from other studies, we show that basal levels of NO production are catalyzed by the nitrite reductase activity of NR. However, we also show that endogenous superoxide production has a significant effect on the levels of bioavailable free NO in the plant. Materials—Sodium diethyldithiocarbamate (DETC), sodium ascorbate, sodium citrate, sodium nitrite, sodium nitrate, l-cysteine, and Hb from Sigma; FeSO4(NH4) from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland); and l-nitroarginine methyl ester acetate and NO-proline (NO-Pr) from Alexis (San Diego, CA) were used in the experiments. Sodium N-methyl-d-glucamine dithiocarbamate (MGD) was a generously gift from Dr. Yu. V. Khropov (Chemical Department of Moscow State University). Gaseous NO was obtained by the reaction of FeSO4 with NaNO2 in 0.1 m HCl and then purified by the method of low temperature sublimation. The paramagnetic dinitrosyl iron complexes with cysteine were obtained by treating the FeSO4 and l-cysteine solutions with gaseous NO at molar ratio 1:30 and at an NO pressure of 100–200 mm Hg. The synthesis was performed in a Thunberg tube apparatus containing 100 ml of gasphase volume. A 0.5-ml aliquot of FeSO4 solution in distilled water (pH 5.5) and 4.5 ml of thiol in 10 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) were placed in the upper and bottom part of the apparatus, respectively. The Thunberg tube was evacuated, and NO was added. Both solutions were then mixed in the presence of NO and shaken for 5 min followed by evacuation of NO from the tube. A 0.5 mm concentration standard for the EPR measurements was made by the addition of an excess of NO-Pr (final concentration, 10 mm) to the solution of 0.5 mm Fe2+ and 5 mm MGD in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (resulting in 0.5 mm MNIC-MGD standards). Experiments on Plant Leaves—A. thaliana (variety Columbia) was grown at low light in John Innes seed and potting compost at a light intensity of 300 μmol photons m–2 s–1 at 80% relative humidity and 25 °C with a 16-h light period in a controlled environment growth cabinet. The plants were used at 28 days post-germination. Vicia faba (broad bean) was greenhouse-grown in seed and potting compost until the third true leaves were mature. Chinese rose (Hibiscus rosa sinensis) was cultivated in a domestic flower border. Rectangular cuts of whole bean leaves (4 × 20 mm; total weight of 40 mg) or whole A. thaliana leaves (10 × 10 mm; total weight of 40 mg) were put into 1.5-ml Eppendorf vials with 1 ml of 5 mm DETC (or MGD) solution with 5 mm sodium ascorbate. 100 mm potassium HEPES buffer was used (pH 7.4). A 10-μl aliquot of the 50 mm stock solution of FeSO4 (NH4) in distilled water was then added to the Eppendorf vial to give a final Fe2+ concentration of 0.5 mm. The leaves (cut or whole) were kept in the solution for 1–3 h at ambient temperature before either leaf tissue (the DETC series) or the solution (the MGD series) were frozen in liquid nitrogen for EPR assays. The addition of exogenous NO donor, NO-Pr resulted in a 6–8-fold increase of MNIC concentration in the preparations (see “Results”), indicating that the concentrations of Fe2+-dithiocarbamate complexes used were sufficient to ensure scavenging of the majority of NO molecules. The use of cut leaves in these experiments ensured that the NO trap only had access to the leaf via the cut edge. The buffer would also enter the leaf via the same route; this resulted in an increase of the buffer capacity in the intercellular space and therefore decreased the likelihood of NO being formed nonenzymatically from any nitrite inside the “acidic” cell compartment. EPR Assays—Most of the EPR spectra were measured at 10 K on a Bruker EMX EPR spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instruments liquid helium system. A spherical high quality Bruker resonator SP9703 was used. The instrumental parameters were: modulation frequency, νm = 100 kHz; microwave frequency, ν = 9.47 GHz; microwave power, p = 0.05 mW; modulation amplitude, Am = 3 G; spectrum sweep rate, V = 3.57 G/s; time constant, τ = 82 ms; and number of scans/ spectrum, NS = 1. The EPR spectra of the Chinese rose leaves were recorded at liquid nitrogen temperature using an X-band Bruker ESC-106 EPR spectrometer (νm = 100 kHz, ν = 9.4 GHz, p = 0.05 mW, Am = 3 G). Wilmad SQ EPR tubes (Wilmad Glass, Buena, NJ) were used for EPR samples. To minimize the effect that slightly different sizes of tubes might have on the quantitative results, only selected tubes were used with outer diameters of 4.05 ± 0.07 mm and inner diameters of 3.12 ± 0.04 mm (mean ± range). To estimate the concentration of paramagnetic centers in the EPR tubes, a set of 0.5 mm standard samples of MNIC-MGD in HEPES was used. The observed concentrations of MNIC-MGD and MNIC-DETC in the EPR tubes are illustrated on each figure, as is the resultant calculation of the rate of NO production in leaves (in nmol/g of wet weight of leaves/h). Although the leaf weight and the time of NO accumulation were the same in the MGD and DETC experiments, the transition coefficients from the observed concentrations of trapped NO in the EPR tubes (in μm) to the NO production in leaf (in nmol g–1 h–1) were different for the two types of experiment. This is because in the case of the water-soluble MGD trap, the whole amount of NO produced by the leaf sample was dissolved in the incubation volume (1-ml Eppendorf vial), of which only an aliquot was taken as an EPR sample, whereas in the case of the lipid soluble DETC experiments it was assumed that all NO produced by the leaf sample is trapped inside the leaf tissue, all of which was then transferred to the EPR tube. Isolated Leaves from Beans and A. thaliana Can Spontaneously Generate NO in Vitro—Fig. 1 demonstrates that isolated leaves produce NO that can be trapped either in the incubation medium or directly in the leaf tissue. The concentration of both MNIC-dithiocarbamate complexes increased approximately linearly with time, within the interval of 0–3 h (illustrated for the MNIC-MGD complexes in Fig. 2). Both kinds of MNIC complexes, the water-soluble MNIC-MGD that accumulates in the medium around the cuts of the leaves and the lipid soluble MNIC-DETC that accumulates in the intracellular membranes, gave similar EPR signals with a g factor symmetry close to axial, spreading from g = 2.049 (peak) to g = 2.025 (trough) and with a triplet hyperfine structure in the area of the perpendicular (low field) components with a distance between components of ∼10 Gauss (Fig. 1). The hyperfine structure resolution in the low field component in the MNIC-MGD signals is not as good as in the MNIC-DETC signals, probably because of the effect of saltification of MNIC-MGD complexes during freezing that results in an increase of the spin-spin interaction. In some MNIC-MGD samples, an asymmetric signal with g = 1.98 was detected at 10 K registration temperature (Fig. 1). The parameters of this signal are close to those that can occasionally result from the freezing of NO molecules in solutions (36Stevens T.H. Brudvig G.W. Bocian D.F. Chan S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3320-3324Google Scholar). An EPR signal of a low intensity from the Cu2+-MGD (and Cu2+-DETC) complexes was a characteristic of all preparations. This signal was particularly distinctly observed in the EPR spectra of the preparations without MNIC-MGD (MNIC-DETC) complexes (Fig. 1d). The signal is characterized by a quartet hyperfine structure arising from the nuclear spin of copper. The doublet splitting in the free radical EPR signal at g = 2.0 in the MNIC-DETC spectra is mainly due to the “dark” free radicals in the photosynthetic system of the leaves (this signal is missing in the MNIC-MGD spectra when the medium of the incubation mixture was analyzed rather than the leaves themselves).Fig. 2The time dependence of the MNIC-MGD complexes formation in the medium of A. thaliana leaves incubation. Leaf cuts in 100 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, were treated with 5 mm MGD in the presence of 5 mm ascorbate and 0.5 mm ferrous sulfate (added last). The concentration is assessed from the EPR spectra of the medium samples frozen at indicated time of MGD treatment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The addition of 100 mm NaNO3 to the leaf medium resulted in a 3–4-fold decrease of formation of MNIC-DETC (Fig. 3, a and c, and Table I), whereas l-nitroarginine methyl ester acetate (a nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor) added at the same concentration did not have a noticeable effect (not shown). When a 10 mm nitrate concentration was used, the amount of MNIC-DETC decreased by 60–70% of the control value (Fig. 3, a and b, and Table I). A similar effect of nitrate addition on the MNIC-MGD formation was also observed (data not shown). This result favors the idea that NR is a significant source of NO production in plant leaves under basal conditions. We suggest that, in agreement with other studies (18Rockel P. Strube F. Rockel A. Wildt J. Kaiser W.M. J. Exp. Bot. 2002; 53: 103-110Google Scholar, 20Yamasaki H. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 2000; 355: 1477-1488Google Scholar), nitrate added at high millimolar concentrations inhibits the nitrite reductase activity of the enzyme by a competitive mechanism, thereby attenuating NO production in the leaves.Table IThe rate of NO generation by leaves (nmol g–1 h–1) was measured by NO trapping and incorporation into MNIC-MGD (MNIC-DETC) paramagnetic complexesPreparationExp. 1Exp. 2Exp. 3Exp. 4Exp. 5Exp. 65 mm MGD + 0.5 mm Fe2+ + 5 mm ascorbate0.34 ± 0.412.56 ± 0.425 mm DETC + 0.5 mm Fe2+ + 5 mm ascorbateaB - C.0.10 ± 0.171.48 ± 0.220.32 ± 0.280.83 ± 0.195 mm MGD + 0.5 mm Fe2+ + 5 mm ascorbate + 1 mm nitrite9.67 ± 1.6018.74 ± 1.675 mm MGD + 0.5 mm Fe2+ + 5 mm ascorbate + 1 mm nitrite + 100 mm nitrate6.29 ± 0.8315.41 ± 1.575 mm DETC + 0.5 mm Fe2+ + 5 mm ascorbate + 100 mm nitrate2.55 ± 0.290.43 ± 0.105 mm DETC + 0.5 mm Fe2+ + 5 mm ascorbate + 10 mm nitrate4.82 ± 0.480.76 ± 0.185 mm DETC + 0.5 mm Fe2+ + 5 mm ascorbate + 0.3 mm NO-PrbA + B - C.28.15 ± 6.5947.08 ± 6.695 mm DETC + 0.5 mm Fe2+ + 5 mm ascorbate + 0.3 mm NO-Pr + 0.1 mm HbcA - C.10.9 ± 1.925 mm DETC + 0.5 mm Fe2+ + 5 mm ascorbate + 0.3 mm NO-Pr + 100 mm nitratecA - C.29.44 ± 4.78a B - C.b A + B - C.c A - C. Open table in a new tab Nitrite and Nitrate as NO Sources in Leaves—The possibility that NR plays a crucial role in NO generation in leaves points to nitrite as the ultimate substrate of the process. The addition of 1 mm nitrite alone resulted in a sharp increase of formation of MNIC-MGD (Fig. 4, a* and b*, and Table I). Even in the preparations where spontaneous formation of the MNIC-MGD complexes was not detected (Fig. 4a), the addition of 1 mm nitrite resulted in a readily quantifiable measure of these complexes (Fig. 4b and Table I). When 1 mm nitrite was added together with 100 mm nitrate, the effect of the complex induction was diminished (Fig. 4, b, c, b*, and c*, and Table I). Curiously, nitrate could induce formation of MNIC-DETC in some leaf preparations that were apparently not capable of spontaneously producing these complexes (Fig. 5). The effect was more pronounced at lower concentrations of nitrate (Fig. 5, b and c). This paradoxically stimulatory effect of nitrate on NO generation can be explained by a rapid transformation of nitrate to nitrite, catalyzed by NR, followed by a catalytic reduction of nitrite to NO. The rate of the NR induced production of NO must therefore depend on the nitrite/nitrate ratio and the total concentration (nitrite + nitrate) in a complex way; at low levels of nitrite, adding nitrate will increase nitrite levels to those necessary to produce detectable NO, and at higher levels of nitrite, the primary effect of nitrate will be to compete with nitrite at the active site and decrease the NO production rates. This effect obviously needs further experimental study and associated kinetic modeling, but it does suggest that the relative and absolute levels of nitrite and nitrate are key determinants in the basal level of NO production in leaves. It has been shown before that NO can be synthesized nonenzymatically from nitrite through its direct interaction with Fe2+-dithiocarbamate complexes (37Tsuchiya K. Yoshizumi M. Houchi H. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1551-1556Google Scholar). Clearly, that cannot be the case for hydrophobic complexes, such as Fe2+-DETC, localized in intracellular membrane compartments to which nitrite does not have access. However, the reaction was shown to take place for water-soluble Fe2+-dithiocarbamate complexes, such as Fe2+-MGD (37Tsuchiya K. Yoshizumi M. Houchi H. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1551-1556Google Scholar). Thus, the possibility exists that the MNIC-MGD complexes in the leaf preparations are formed via this nonenzymatic mechanism of nitrite reduction by the Fe2+-MGD complexes in the medium and not via the intracellular NO generation by NR. Nitrite, in turn, could be produced enzymatically by the leaf. However, this hypothesis can be dismissed if quantitative considerations were taken into account. The steady state concentration of nitrite in the leaf tissue is about 10 μm (18Rockel P. Strube F. Rockel A. Wildt J. Kaiser W.M. J. Exp. Bot. 2002; 53: 103-110Google Scholar). If, hypothetically, we could instantly release all that concentration to the incubation medium to allow nitrite to interact with Fe2+-MGD, nitrite would have been diluted to the concentration of 10 μm·(vl/vm) = 0.4 μm, where vl and vm are the volumes of the leaf sample (40 μl) and of the incubation medium (1 ml). It has been established that if 1 mm nitrite is present in a 0.5 mm Fe2+-MGD solution, it will be reduced at a rate of MNIC-MGD formation of 3 μm over 3 h (37Tsuchiya K. Yoshizumi M. Houchi H. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1551-1556Google Scholar). If we consider the reaction to be pseudo-first order in nitrite, 0.4 μm nitrite in a 0.5 mm Fe2+-MGD solution will result in a rate of MNIC-MGD formation of 3 μm · (0.4 μm/1000 μm) = 0.0012 μm over 3 h. Yet the values we found in the experiments are significantly higher. For example, the bean and Arabidopsis preparations showed the total concentrations of MNIC-MGD in the medium after 3 h of incubation of 4.3 and 0.9 μm, respectively (Fig. 1, e and f). Therefore intercellular nitrite concentrations of the order of 10 mm would be necessary to induce this level of MNIC-MGD nonenzymatically. This is only possible under extremes of conditions (180 min of dark anoxia) not present in these studies (18Rockel P. Strube F. Rockel A. Wildt J. Kaiser W.M. J. Exp. Bot. 2002; 53: 103-110Google Scholar). Therefore we conclude that the observed level of formation of the MNIC-MGD complexes in the leaf incubation medium cannot be explained exclusively, or indeed significantly, by the formation of NO formed via nitrite reduction by Fe2+-MGD. Why Is the Amount of Spontaneously Generated NO So Variable in Isolated Leaves?—The method of NO trapping by ferrous-dithiocarbamate is characterized by a large variation in the concentration of detected complexes. There are two probable explanations for this. The first one is that variations in the nitrite/nitrate ratio in the leaves can have a very complex effect on NO production, as described previously. However, small variations in the rate of superoxide anion production can also cause variations in the basally detected level of MNIC. The presence of superoxide in the leaves will transform MNIC-MGD (and MNIC-DETC) complexes to an EPR-silent state (34Vanin A.F. Huisman A. Stroes E.S. de Ruijter-Heijstek F.C. Rabelink T.J. van Faassen E.E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 813-824Google Scholar, 35Vanin A.F. Huisman A. van Faassen E.E. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 359: 27-42Google Scholar). It is well known that plants respond to a stressful environment with an activation of their superoxide production (30Lamb C. Dixon R.A. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 251-275Google Scholar). The extent of the activation depends on changes in plant cultivation, for example on the change of light condition, temperature, humidity, etc. All of these factors could result in a dramatic decrease in the concentration of detected MNIC-MGD (MNIC-DETC) complexes, sometimes down to a zero level. We have previously shown, for example, that increased superoxide production accompanies leaf wounding (33Fryer M.J. Ball L. Oxborough K. Karpinski S. Mullineaux P.M. Baker N.R. Plant J. 2003; 33: 691-705Google Scholar, 38Fryer M.J. Oxborough K. Mullineaux P.M. Baker N.R. J. Exp.

https://openalex.org/W1983083500,"A cytoplasmic dynein is a microtubule-based motor protein involved in diverse cellular functions, such as organelle transport and chromosome segregation. The dynein has two ring-shaped heads that contain six repeats of the AAA domain responsible for ATP hydrolysis. It has been proposed that the ATPase-dependent swing of a stalk and a stem emerging from each of the heads generates the power stroke (Burgess, S.A. (2003) Nature 421, 715–718). To understand the molecular mechanism of the dynein power stroke, it is essential to establish an easy and reproducible method to express and purify the recombinant dynein with full motor activities. Here we report the expression and purification of the C-terminal 380-kDa fragment of the Dictyostelium cytoplasmic dynein heavy-chain fused with an affinity tag and green fluorescent protein. The purified single-headed recombinant protein drove the robust minus-end-directed sliding of microtubules at a velocity of 1.2 μm/s. This recombinant protein had a high basal ATPase activity (∼4s– 1), which was further activated by >15-fold on the addition of 40 μm microtubules. These results show that the 380-kDa recombinant fragment retains all the structures required for motor functions, i.e. the ATPase activity highly stimulated by microtubules and the robust motility.

The cytoplasmic dynein, which is an enormous complex composed of two identical heavy-chains (molecular mass, >500 kDa) as well as several intermediate-, light intermediate-, and light-chains, plays an essential role as the molecular motor for cellular transports and chromosomal segregation (1Vallee R.B. Sheetz M.P. Science. 1996; 271: 1539-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 2Holzbaur E.L. Vallee R.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 339-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The heavy-chain folds into a ring-like head composed of six AAA domains, a stem, and a stalk emerging from the head (3King S.M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2521-2526PubMed Google Scholar, 4Mocz G.

The stalk is the microtubule-binding domain with a long coiled-coil structure (6Gee M.A. Heuser J.E. Vallee R.B. Nature. 1997; 390: 636-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 7Goodenough U.

The swing of the stem and the stalk induced by ATP hydrolysis has been proposed to be responsible for the force-producing power stroke (9Burgess S.A. Walker M.L. Sakakibara H. Knight P.J. Oiwa K. Nature. 2003; 421: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). To elucidate further the molecular details of this force production by dynein, it is essential to construct an easy and reproducible system for expressing and purifying recombinant dynein with motile activity. Although it was reported that the purified full-length heavy-chain of rat cytoplasmic dynein expressed in insect cells drove the microtubule sliding (10Mazumdar M. Mikami A. Gee M.A. Vallee R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6552-6556Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), it remains to be clarified how the endogenous insect dynein present in the rat dynein preparation contributed to the observed microtubule sliding. Considering the fact that the cytoplasmic dynein is a processive motor and drives the microtubule sliding even at a very low concentration (11Wang Z. Khan S. Sheetz M.P. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 2011-2023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 12King S.J. Schroer T.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), in vitro motility assays must be designed to eliminate the possibility that contaminating proteins rather than the recombinant dyneins drive the microtubule sliding. The 380-kDa fragment of the Dictyostelium dynein heavy-chain has been successfully expressed in Dictyostelium cells (13Koonce M.P. Samso M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 935-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Electron microscopic studies on the fragment have shown that it has a single ring-shaped head and a stalk protruding from it (14Samso M. Radermacher M. Frank J. Koonce M.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 927-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This fragment binds to microtubules in an ATP-sensitive fashion and is susceptible to VO4-mediated photo-cleavage (13Koonce M.P. Samso M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 935-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), an indication that the fragment may have ATPase activity. However, it remains to be shown whether this recombinant dynein fragment is an active motor with microtubule-activated ATPase activity and motility. Here, we have established an expression and purification system of the single-headed Dictyostelium 380-kDa dynein fragment fused with the N-terminal His tag and GFP 1The abbreviations and trivial names used are: GFP, green fluorescent protein; HG380, the 380-kDa fragment of dynein heavy chain fused with His tag and GFP; GST·GFP, GFP fused with glutathione S-transferase. (designated HG380) and have shown that it can drive the robust sliding of microtubules and has high microtubule-activated ATPase activity. Thus, this heavy-chain fragment is an active motor that contains all structures required for force generation. Plasmid Constructs and Expression of Cytoplasmic Dynein Fragments—A 14-kbp fragment of the Dictyostelium Ax2 genome encoding the full-length cytoplasmic dynein heavy-chain (13Koonce M.P. Samso M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 935-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 15Koonce M.P. Grissom P.M. McIntosh J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1597-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) was cloned by genomic PCR. A fragment of the cloned DNA that spans the KpnI site (4,146 bp from the start codon) and the stop codon (14,175 bp) was manipulated so that the His6 tag and enhanced GFP were fused at the N terminus of the 380-kDa fragment, as shown in Fig. 1. A linker was also inserted so that -Gly-Gly-Gly- would be inserted between the C terminus of GFP and the N terminus of the truncated dynein heavy-chain. This HG380 construct was cloned into an extrachromosomal vector for tetracycline-regulated expression in Dictyostelium cells (16Blaauw M. Linskens M.H. van Haastert P.J. Gene. 2000; 252: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A deletion construct lacking the microtubule-binding site at the end of the stalk (deletion from 10099 to 10476 bp) was also constructed. The latter was designated HG380ΔMT. The Dictyostelium cells used for the tetracycline-regulated expression system were derived from Ax2 as described (16Blaauw M. Linskens M.H. van Haastert P.J. Gene. 2000; 252: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These cells can be negatively regulated by tetracycline and have antibiotic resistance for G418. For the expression of HG380 or HG380ΔMT, the extrachromosomal plasmids carrying the corresponding genes were introduced into these Dictyostelium cells by electroporation as described (17Schlatterer C. Knoll G. Malchow D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 58: 172-181PubMed Google Scholar). The transformed cells were grown as described (18Franke J. Kessin R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2157-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) in an axenic medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml blasticidin S, 10 μg/ml G418, and 10 μg/ml tetracycline to inhibit expression of the recombinant proteins. When cells grew to 5 × 106/ml, the medium was replaced with one without tetracycline to start the induction of these recombinant proteins. Protein Purification—All procedures were carried out at 4 °C or on ice unless otherwise stated. Twenty-four hours after induction, Dictyostelium cells expressing HG380 or HG380ΔMT were harvested and resuspended in an equal volume of PMG buffer (100 mm PIPES-KOH, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.9 m glycerol, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm β-melcaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml chymostatin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 500 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mm ATP, pH 7.0). The cells were homogenized by sonication and centrifuged at 24,000 × g for 20 min and then at 187,000 × g for 60 min. The high speed supernatant was mixed with Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads and incubated for 60 min. After precipitation and washing, the adsorbed proteins were eluted from the beads four times with PMG buffer supplemented with 250 mm imidazole. The four eluted fractions were mixed and loaded onto a PD-10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences) to replace the solvent to a PMEG buffer (100 mm PIPES-KOH, 4 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.9 m glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml chymostatin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 500 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mm ATP, pH 7.0) (19Koonce M.P. McIntosh J.R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1990; 15: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The eluted fraction from PD-10 was mixed with microtubules prepared from porcine brain (20Sloboda R.D. Rosenbaum J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), paclitaxel, and adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imido) triphosphate so that their final concentrations would be 1 mg/ml, 10 μm, and 0.5 mm, respectively. The mixture was then incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The HG380 molecules complexed with microtubules were pelleted at 46,200 × g for 20 min at 25 °C through a PMEG cushion containing 25% sucrose without ATP. The pellet was suspended in a PMEG buffer containing 10 mm MgATP and 10 μm paclitaxel. The microtubules were pelleted again at 356,000 × g for 10 min at 25 °C to release HG380. The supernatant contained HG380. Glycerol and ATP were included throughout the HG380 preparation because we observed that the protein was unstable without them. The purified proteins were stored on ice and used within 2 days. Protein Concentrations—Protein concentrations of HG380 were routinely determined by the Bradford method (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) by using bovine serum albumin as a standard. These concentrations were calibrated by using the absorption of GFP as follows. First, we determined the concentration of purified GST·GFP expressed in Escherichia coli by using the molecular extinction coefficient of GFP (55,900 at 488 nm; Ref. 22Sullivan K.F. Kay S.A. Methods in Cell Biology. 58. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1999: 19-30Google Scholar). Then we determined the concentration of HG380 by comparing the fluorescence intensity of GST·GFP at 510 nm (excited at 488 nm) to that of HG380. We did not directly use the molar extinction coefficient of GFP to determine the concentration of HG380 because the GFP absorbance of purified HG380 at 488 nm was not high enough for accurate measurements. The results showed that the Bradford method gave almost the same concentrations as those obtained by the absorption of GFP at 488 nm (within an error of 20%). The concentration of tubulin was also determined by the Bradford method as described (23Shimizu T. Toyoshima Y.Y. Edamatsu M. Vale R.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1575-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Measurements of Microtubule-activated ATPase Activity—Just before ATPase measurements, the amount of ATP in the purified HG380 was depleted to 0.1 mm by a NAP-5 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences). The ATPase assay was performed using the EnzChek phosphate assay kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The assay conditions were as follows: assay buffer, 10 mm PIPES-KOH, 50 mm potassium acetate, 4 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EGTA, 10 μm paclitaxel, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.0; HG380, 5 μg/ml (12.5 nm); microtubules, 0 ∼40 μm; temperature, 25 °C. The reaction was followed by continuously monitoring the absorbance at 360 nm. For each set of measurements of the microtubule-activated ATPase activity, we checked the background phosphate-release rate of microtubules alone. The average background rate of steady-state increase of absorption at 360 nm in the presence of microtubules without HG380 was ∼0.2 nm/s/μm microtubule. Thus, the free phosphate ions present in tubulin preparation or released from the intrinsic GTPase activity of microtubules rarely contributed to the ATPase activities of HG380 even at the highest microtubule concentration used here (40 μm). The observed specific activity kobs is a sum of the basal ATPase activity kB and the maximally activated ATPase activity kCAT as shown in Equation 1, where [MT] is the microtubule concentration and KMT is the microtubule concentration at the half saturation of microtubule-activated ATPase activity. kobs=kCAT{[MT]/(KMT+[MT])}+kB{1−[MT]/(KMT+[MT])}=(kCAT−kB){[MT]/(KMT+[MT])}+kB (Eq. 1) Thus, (kobs-kB) values were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation to obtain the kCAT and KMT values. In Vitro Motility Assays—Assays were performed at 25 °C in the ATPase buffer without dithiothreitol. This buffer was used for every step of the motility assay unless otherwise stated. The assay chamber was coated sequentially with streptavidin (1 mg/ml), biotinyl protein G (1 mg/ml), and anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (Qbiogene, Carlsbad, CA) diluted to 100 μg/ml by the assay buffer containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The chamber surface was finally blocked with 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The purified HG380 diluted to 50 μg/ml was introduced into the chamber twice at 5-min intervals. After 5 min, 30 μg/ml of paclitaxel-stabilized microtubules was introduced into the chamber. After another 5 min, the assay chamber was washed, and then the assay buffer containing 1 mm ATP was introduced. The control IgG2a (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA), which belongs to the same subclass as that of the anti-GFP antibody but does not cross-react with GFP, was diluted to 100 μg/ml and used for control experiments (Fig. 3b). Microtubules were observed using dark-field illumination with a ×40 objective lens and recorded with video tape recorder. The recordings were digitized and analyzed. All microtubules longer than 5 μm in randomly selected microscopic fields were chosen for measurements. The sliding velocity of microtubules that translocated in a continuous manner for at least 4 s was measured. Some of the microtubules translocated only occasionally and for only a short period of time. They were counted as non-motile microtubules. For the experiments with the control IgG2a, the motion of microtubules was followed for more than 20 s. The polarity-marked microtubules were prepared as described (24Vale R.D. Toyoshima Y.Y. Cell. 1988; 52: 459-469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The motility assay using polarity-marked microtubules was performed in the assay buffer containing 20 μm paclitaxel. The single-headed cytoplasmic dynein fragment HG380 was expressed in Dictyostelium cells by using the tetracycline-dependent promoter (16Blaauw M. Linskens M.H. van Haastert P.J. Gene. 2000; 252: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). When tetracycline was depleted from the medium to activate the transcription, the recombinant dynein was expressed transiently (Fig. 2a, HSS). The expressed HG380 was purified first by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Fig. 2a, elution-1–4) and then by co-precipitation with microtubules. Finally, HG380 was released from the precipitated microtubules by MgATP. When checked by SDS-PAGE, this final HG380 preparation did not show any visible band corresponding to the endogenous dynein heavy-chain (Fig. 2a, +ATP sup). We first examined whether HG380 retains motile activity. To eliminate the possibility that the endogenous Dictyostelium dynein or kinesin that might be present in the HG380 preparation or the brain dynein that might be present in the tubulin preparation could drive the microtubule sliding, we constructed the following assay system (Fig. 3a). A slide glass was covered sequentially with streptavidin, biotinyl protein G, and monoclonal anti-GFP antibody. The HG380 was fixed on the glass surface by this antibody through the GFP moiety, though some of the recombinant protein might have bound to the glass surface nonspecifically. When the motility assays were carried out in this system, most of the microtubules (83%) slid smoothly with an average velocity of 1.2 μm/s (Fig. 3b), which is comparable with the velocity of the brain cytoplasmic dynein (23Shimizu T. Toyoshima Y.Y. Edamatsu M. Vale R.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1575-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 25Paschal B.M. Shpetner H.S. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1273-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). In the assays using polarity-marked microtubules, most of these sliding filaments (>98%) moved so that their modified minus-ends were back (Fig. 3c), indicating that the minus-end-directed motors drove the robust sliding of these microtubules (24Vale R.D. Toyoshima Y.Y. Cell. 1988; 52: 459-469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Thus, it is very likely that the sliding was driven by dynein, not by the plus-end-directed kinesin that might be present in the HG380 preparation as contamination. Some microtubules (17%) did not move, possibly because they bound on the HG380 molecules nonspecifically absorbed on the glass surface. When the control IgG2a that does not cross-react to GFP was used in place of the anti-GFP antibody, most of the microtubules did not slide on the addition of ATP, although some of them (18%) slid very slowly with an average velocity of 0.3 μm/s (Fig. 3b). These results showed that the HG380 molecules trapped with anti-GFP antibodies on the glass surface supported the smooth, robust sliding of microtubules. To further confirm this notion, we performed mock experiments by using an HG380 derivative in which the microtubule-binding site at the end of the stalk (6Gee M.A. Heuser J.E. Vallee R.B. Nature. 1997; 390: 636-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 26Koonce M.P. Tikhonenko I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) was deleted (Fig. 1, HG380ΔMT). The deletion mutant was transiently expressed as in the case of HG380. The expression level of HG380ΔMT was very similar to that of HG380 (Fig. 2b, HSS). HG380ΔMT was first purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads and then co-precipitated with microtubules. Unlike the case of HG380, however, HG380ΔMT did not co-precipitate with microtubules as expected, because it lacked the microtubule-binding site. Thus, only a small amount of proteins was released from the precipitated microtubules on the addition of ATP (Fig. 2b, +ATP sup). When this ATP-released protein mixture was used for the motility assay in place of HG380, virtually no microtubule was trapped on the glass surface. The result ensured that microtubules on the glass surface covered with HG380 were actually trapped there by binding to this recombinant protein. This result eliminated the possibility that the endogenous Dictyostelium dynein that might be present in the HG380 preparation or the dynein that might be present in the brain tubulin preparation drove the microtubule sliding. Thus, based on these control experiments, we have established that the HG380 molecules were the motor proteins that drove the robust, minus-end-directed sliding of microtubules. The HG380 protein had a high basal ATPase activity (4.4 s–1), which was further stimulated >15-fold on the addition of 40 μm microtubules (Fig. 4). By fitting the microtubule-activated activities measured in the presence of various concentrations of microtubules with a hyperbola, the maximal ATPase activity stimulated by microtubules (kcat) was calculated to be 160 s–1. The microtubule concentration needed for the half-maximal stimulation (KMT) was 68 μm. Although this KMT value seems to be unusually high compared with other MT-based motor proteins, this value for HG380 was highly dependent on ionic strength, implying that MT and HG380 are held together in the presence of ATP by weak ionic interactions. Both the basal and microtubule-activated ATPase activities of this single-headed dynein were much higher than those reported for the native two-headed cytoplasmic dyneins (23Shimizu T. Toyoshima Y.Y. Edamatsu M. Vale R.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1575-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 27Shpetner H.S. Paschal B.M. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1001-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). One reason for these high ATPase activities of HG380 could be that truncation of the stem tail leaves the single-headed motor domain in an uncontrolled state because of the loss of the other head, both of which could be kinetically coupled in the dimeric molecule during their ATPase cycle. In this context, it must be noticed that the recombinant heterodimeric complex of Drosophila cytoplasmic dynein containing only a single motor domain does not show the ATP-dependent MT-binding characteristic of the wild-type cytoplasmic dynein, suggesting that the functional coupling of two motor domains is lost by truncation of one of them (28Iyadurai S.J. Li M.G. Gilbert S.P. Hays T.S. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 771-774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Because it has been shown that the conventional kinesin is in a folded and inhibited state with low microtubule-activated ATPase activity and is unfolded by truncation of the tail domain to exhibit a highly stimulated microtubule-activated ATPase activity (29Hackney D.D. Stock M.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), we may consider the possibility that the ATPase cycle of the motor domain of cytoplasmic dynein is released from the suppressed state by truncation of the stem tail. In summary, we have established an easy and reproducible method for generating recombinant dyneins with full motor activities: the single-headed recombinant fragment HG380 retains the ability to drive the robust sliding of microtubules and exhibits high microtubule-activated ATPase activity. We thank Dr. Peter J. Van Haastert (University of Groningen) for providing the tetracycline-regulated expression system. We also thank Kenya Furuta (University of Tokyo) for help in developing the motility analysis program."

Therefore, saturated and unsaturated FAs liberated from triglycerides (TAGs) or imported as free FAs from blood are interchangeably utilized via β-oxidation to generate ATP to power myosin movement. Adipocytes, on the other hand, are a storage depot for energy and therefore primarily function in the generation of TAGs from saturated and unsaturated free FAs that are stored in lipid droplets within the cell. During differentiation neurons require substantial amounts of FAs for phospholipid (PL) synthesis to generate extensive neurites that are the morphological and physiological hallmarks of these cells. This process utilizes FA from two sources: de novo FA synthesis through the action of the enzyme fattyacid synthase and uptake of essential FAs, which cannot be synthesized by mammals because they lack the desaturase enzymes that introduce double bonds at the n-3 and n-6 positions (1Innis S.M. Prog. Lipid Res. 1991; 30: 39-103Google Scholar). Despite this deficiency, the plasma membranes of neurons are enriched in PLs containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), especially the essential FAs arachidonic acid (AA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), members of the n-6 and n-3 FA series, respectively (1Innis S.M. Prog. Lipid Res. 1991; 30: 39-103Google Scholar). Therefore, AA and DHA are internalized from dietary sources or generated by elongating shorter chain precursors within the astrocytes of the nervous system or in the liver (2Moore S.A. Yoder E. Murphy S. Dutton G.R. Spector A.A. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 518-524Google Scholar, 3Scott B.L. Bazan N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2903-2907Google Scholar). Within neurons, DHA and AA are used primarily as structural components of the plasma membrane and as signaling molecules (4Lauritzen L. Hansen H.S. Jorgensen M.H. Michaelsen K.F. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 1-94Google Scholar). A possible function for DHA and AA in the plasma membrane is to provide extra flexibility and fluidity to highly curved membranes, such as those at the neural synapses and in the disks of the photoreceptor outer segment (5Stubbs C.D. Smith A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 779: 89-137Google Scholar). Several reports suggested that DHA may also prevent apoptosis in neurons (6Kim H.Y. Akbar M. Kim K.Y. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2001; 16 (279-284): 223-227Google Scholar). AA is believed to function directly as a signaling molecule and is a precursor of several eicosanoid molecules that also have signaling functions within the nervous system (7Bazan N.G. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 2221-2233Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear how neurons enrich for PUFAs, although other cell types, such as adipocytes, are relatively non-enriched for any specific FAs. Additionally, the mechanisms used by the cell to channel FAs toward one complex lipid pathway (for example PLs or TAGs) versus another remain unidentified. Several reports (8Hirsch D. Stahl A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8625-8629Google Scholar, 9Black P.N. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2850-2854Google Scholar, 10Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Google Scholar) have implicated the six members of the FA transport proteins (FATPs) family, all integral plasma membrane proteins, as the primary proteins that facilitate the transport of FAs across the lipid bilayer into the cell. Once inside the cell, FAs are activated by the addition of coenzyme A (CoA) via the action of an acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS), thus increasing the solubility of the FA and preparing it for utilization by one of many lipid metabolism pathways. Previous studies (10Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Google Scholar, 11Black P.N. DiRusso C.C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 454-472Google Scholar) have shown that ACS is not only capable of activating FAs but also appears to facilitate the internalization of FAs probably by preventing the repartitioning of the FA back into the plasma membrane. Co-overexpression of ACS and FATP in 3T3-L1 or yeast cells synergistically increases the rate of FA internalization suggesting that FATP and ACS act in concert to facilitate FA internalization (12Gargiulo C.E. Stuhlsatz-Krouper S.M. Schaffer J.E. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 881-892Google Scholar, 13Zou Z. Tong F. Faergeman N.J. Borsting C. Black P.N. DiRusso C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16414-16422Google Scholar). Once activated, FAs can be utilized as a signaling molecule, constructively for PL and TAG synthesis or destructively as an energy source via β-oxidation. These processes are believed to occur within specific regions of the cell and may be influenced by the subcellular localization of specific ACS isoforms (14Lewin T.M. Kim J.H. Granger D.A. Vance J.E. Coleman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24674-24679Google Scholar). Five members of the ACS family have been identified that exhibit unique temporal and tissue expression patterns in mammals. Each enzyme activates various length FAs with different efficiencies. Biochemical studies have shown that ACS1 and ACS5 activate 16–20 carbon unsaturated FAs with equal efficiency (15Iijima H. Fujino T. Minekura H. Suzuki H. Kang M.J. Yamamoto T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 186-190Google Scholar, 16Oikawa E. Iijima H. Suzuki T. Sasano H. Sato H. Kamataki A. Nagura H. Kang M.J. Fujino T. Suzuki H. Yamamoto T.T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 679-685Google Scholar), whereas ACS2, ACS3, and ACS4 activate 20 and 22 carbon unsaturated FAs more efficiently (15Iijima H. Fujino T. Minekura H. Suzuki H. Kang M.J. Yamamoto T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 186-190Google Scholar, 17Kang M.J. Fujino T. Sasano H. Minekura H. Yabuki N. Nagura H. Iijima H. Yamamoto T.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2880-2884Google Scholar, 18Fujino T. Kang M.J. Suzuki H. Iijima H. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16748-16752Google Scholar). However, little is known about the specific function of these proteins within the cell. Coleman and co-workers (14Lewin T.M. Kim J.H. Granger D.A. Vance J.E. Coleman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24674-24679Google Scholar, 19Coleman R.A. Lewin T.M. Van Horn C.G. Gonzalez-Baro M.R. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 2123-2126Google Scholar, 20Lewin T.M. Van Horn C.G. Krisans S.K. Coleman R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 404: 263-270Google Scholar) performed several biochemical experiments using primary liver cultures and proposed that individual ACS isoforms may channel FAs toward specific complex lipid pathways. Our analysis focused on ACS1 and ACS2 because our preliminary real time PCR studies revealed that ACS1 mRNA was significantly induced upon differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells, a model adipocyte cell line that utilizes FAs primarily for TAG synthesis, but not in differentiated PC12 cells, which use FAs primarily for phospholipid synthesis. In contrast, ACS2 mRNA was significantly induced in differentiated PC12 cells but not expressed in 3T3-L1 cells. To test the hypothesis that ACS2 functions in PUFA internalization and PL synthesis, we overexpressed it as well as ACS1 in PC12 cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, in differentiated ACS2-overexpressing cells, the rates of AA and DHA internalization were increased, and when the medium was supplemented with AA or DHA the average neurite length was significantly increased. In contrast, ACS1 overexpression had no effect on neurite length. Cell Culture—PC12 and 3T3-L1 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). PC12 cells were grown in 10% fetal bovine serum in RPMI 1640 medium on collagen-coated plates (VWR Scientific) at 37 °C in an incubator with 5% CO2. Cells were split bi-weekly at 5 × 106 cells/100-mm plate. For differentiation, cells were treated for 8 min at 37 °C with 0.25% trypsin, triturated through a 19-needle gauge attached to a syringe, counted, and plated in growth media at 5 × 105 cells/100-mm plate for neurite outgrowth and 1 × 106/100-mm plate for FA uptake and TAG analysis. After 24 h, growth media were exchanged for differentiation media (0.25% horse serum, RPMI 1640, 75 ng/ml nerve growth factor (Alexis), 15 μm FA free-BSA ± free FA (OA, AA, or DHA (Sigma)). 3T3-L1 cells were cultured and differentiated as described previously (21Frost S. Lane M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2646-2652Google Scholar). Generation of Ecotropic Receptor Overexpressing PC12 Cells, Retroviral Transduction, and FACS Analysis—The plasmid pM5-EcoRneo (22Baker B.W. Boettiger D. Spooncer E. Norton J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5234Google Scholar), which contains the murine ecotropic receptor cDNA and a neomycin resistance gene, was transfected into PC12 cells using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen). To isolate stable clones, the transfected cells were cultured in media supplemented with 1 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) for 2 weeks. Twelve colonies were isolated, expanded, and tested as described under “Results.” To make retroviral supernatant, 10 μg of pMSCVpuro-IRES2-EGFP, pMSCVpuro-ratACS1-IRES2-EGFP, or pMSCVpuro-ratACS2-IRES2-EGFP and 5 μg of PCL-Eco (23Naviaux R. Costanzi E. Haas M. Verma I. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5701-5705Google Scholar) were transfected into the Phoenix cell packaging line (Gary Nolan, Stanford University), and the supernatant was collected 48 h later. For retroviral infections, PC12 cells were plated at 2.5 × 106 cells/60-mm collagencoated plate and infected with retroviral supernatant supplemented with 2 μg/ml Polybrene. After 16 h, the media were replaced with PC12 growth media and exchanged every 48 h until analysis. To determine the percent of cells transduced, cells were removed from the plates by incubating the cells in 0.25% trypsin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 8 min, triturated five times through a 19-gauge needle attached to a syringe, pelleted, and resuspended in 1× PBS with 0.5 μg/ml propidium iodide (to identify dead cells). The level of GFP fluorescence was determined for 10,000 cells by using a BD Biosciences FACScan. Cells were used for analysis 7–10 days after the start of infection. Isolation and Construction of ACS1 and ACS2 Overexpression Plasmids—The IRES2-EGFP insert was removed from pIRES2EGFP (Clontech) by digestion with BglII and HpaI and was subcloned into pMSCV puromycin (Clontech) by using BglII and HpaI restriction sites generating pMSCVpuroIRES2-EGFP. Rat ACS1 and rat ACS2 sequences were obtained from GenBank™ (accession number J05439 for ACS1 and D10041 for ACS2). Rat ACS1 and rat ACS2 coding sequences were amplified from PC12 cell total mRNA using the following primers: ACS1 sense 5′-CCCCTCGAGATGGAAGTCCACGAATTGTTC-3′; ACS1 antisense 5′-CCCGGATCCTTAAATCTTGATGGTTGGAGTAC-3′; ACS2 sense, 5′-CCCCTCGAGATGCAGACCCAGGAGATCCTG-3′; and ACS2 antisense 5′-CCCTTCGAATCACATGGAGATTGAGTACAGCTC-3′. Rat ACS1 coding sequence was subcloned into the XhoI and BamHI sites of pMSCVpuroIRES2-EGFP, generating pMSCVpuro-rat-ACS1-IRES2-EGFP. Rat ACS2 coding sequence was subcloned into the XhoI and BstBI sites of pMSCVpuroIRES2-EGFP, generating pMSCVpuro-ratACS2-IRES2-EGFP. Real Time-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from cells using the Qiagen RNeasy miniprep kits and quantitated by absorbance at 260 nm with a Shimadzu UV-1601 spectrophotometer. cDNA was synthesized by using 2 μg of total RNA and 200 ng of random hexamers according to the first-strand cDNA synthesis protocol provided with Superscript II RNase H-Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). For real time-PCR, samples were analyzed in triplicate 25-μl reactions (10 ng of cDNA, 900 nmol of primer, 12.5 μl of Master mix and water), which was adapted from the standard protocol provided in SyBR® Green PCR Master Mix and RT-PCR Protocol provided by Applied Biosystems. Primers were designed to coding sequence using ABI Prism Primer Express 2.0 software. The default PCR protocol was used on an Applied Biosystems Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System. The rat primers are as follows: ACS1 forward, 5′-agctgattgacattcggcagt-3′; ACS1 reverse, 5′-cgaagcccatgagtgtgttg-3′; ACS2 forward, 5′-cagccaccacccttgtgagt-3′; ACS2 reverse, 5′-agtatgcaaggatggcagcc-3′; ACS3 forward, 5′-ttgagcggatgtacggaagaa-3′; ACS3 reverse, 5′-gagtttgccttggcctgaga-3′; ACS4 forward, 5′-tgaagtgaactgccgagtgaa-3′; ACS4 reverse, 5′-tcagtcccagtgcagtgagg-3′; ACS5 forward, 5′-aggcgctttccagaagaacaa-3′; ACS5 reverse, 5′-tggcgtctgagaagtaataaagga-3′; cyclophilin B forward, 5′-ttccatcgtgtcatcaaggact-3′; and cyclophilin B reverse, 5′-gccatctcccctggtgaagt-3′. Neurite Outgrowth Analysis—Cells were plated and differentiated as described except that the differentiation media were supplemented with 7.5 μm of OA, AA, or DHA and 15 μm FA-free BSA. The cells were differentiated for 3 days before phase contrast and fluorescence images were captured using a Spot CCD camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.) mounted on a Nikon TS100 inverted microscope using Spotfire software. To determine the aggregate neurite length for each cell, the phase contrast image was converted from gray scale to CMYK in Adobe Photoshop. The black channel was then “filled in” white, and the neurites were traced in black using the pencil function in Adobe Photoshop. To determine which cells were GFP-positive, the GFP fluorescent image was “pasted” into the cyan, magenta, and yellow channels of the traced phase contrast image. To measure aggregate neurite length, the black channel, which contained the neurite tracings, was inverted, converted to gray scale, and analyzed with ImageGauge software (Fuji Photo Film Co.), which quantitates the number of black pixels, a relative measure of neurite length. A stage micrometer was used to determine that 1000 pixels is equivalent to a length of 10 μm. The presence of GFP fluorescence within a cell was used to identify which cells were transduced. For each condition examined, significant changes in neurite length were determined using the two-tailed, Student's t test with equal variance comparing the experimental cells to the control cells. TAG Analysis—Cells were plated and differentiated as described except that the differentiation media were supplemented with the appropriate amount of free FA and 15 μm FA-free BSA. After 3 days, the cells were harvested, spun down, and resuspended in 1% SDS at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/20 μl. The cells were lysed, and the DNA was sheared by trituration through a 27-gauge needle. 40 μl of cell lysate was added to 0.65 ml of reagent A (Triglyceride H kit, Wako Diagnostics), incubated for 5 min at 37 °C, followed by the addition of 0.325 ml of reagent B and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The absorbance at 600 nm was determined using a Shimadzu UV-1601 spectrophotometer. FA Uptake Analysis—Cells were plated and differentiated as described. The cells were removed from the plates by trituration with a Pasteur pipette, washed in serum-free RPMI 1640, counted, and resuspended in serum-free RPMI 1640 at 5 × 105 cells/ml. 1 ml of cells was added to a 1-ml mixture of 10 mm taurocholate, 1× PBS that contained 5 μm14C-radiolabeled FA that had been sonicated for 15 min to create mixed micelles. Every 30 sec for 2 min, 450 μl of the reaction was collected and the reaction stopped by adding the aliquot to 4 ml of ice-cold 1× PBS, 0.1% FA-free BSA. Once all the time points were collected, the cells were harvested onto filter paper and washed extensively with 0.1% FA-free BSA, 1× PBS using a Brandel multisample collector to remove non-cell-associated FAs. Cells were lysed in 4 ml of EcoScint H (National Diagnostics), and the amount of cell-associated radioactivity was determined with a scintillation counter. The counts were plotted versus time to obtain the slope, which is the rate of uptake. Lipid Analysis—FA uptake assays were performed as described in the previous section, and the filter paper was placed in 4.8 ml of methanol/chloroform/water (2:1:0.8) and sonicated for 30 min in a bath sonicator. Non-solubilized material was removed by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 5 min in a table top centrifuge. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube, 2 ml of chloroform/water (1:1) was added, the sample was vigorously mixed for 1 min, and the phases were separated by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 5 min. The chloroform phase was collected, evaporated under a stream of nitrogen, resuspended in chloroform, and loaded on a silica G plate (Analtech) for separation by TLC. Complex lipid species were resolved by elution with petroleum ether/diethyl ether/acetic acid (90:10:1). The plates were then sprayed with En3hance (DuPont) and exposed to film overnight at –80 °C to locate the phospholipids, diacylglycerides, free fatty acids, and triglycerides. These lipid species were scraped from the plate, and the amount of radioactivity was determined with a scintillation counter. FA Internalization, Neurite Outgrowth, and TAG Accumulation upon Neuronal Differentiation of PC12 Cells—To determine whether enrichment of PUFAs within the plasma membrane of neurons could be a consequence of an increased rate of PUFA internalization, we used radiolabeled OA, AA, and DHA to examine the change in the rate these FAs are internalized into undifferentiated and differentiated PC12 cells, a model neuronal cell line. 3T3-L1 cells, a model adipocyte cell line, were analyzed in parallel. When PC12 cells were differentiated for 3 days, the rate of OA internalization increased ∼5-fold from 0.19–0.98 fmol/cell/min, the rate of AA internalization increased ∼7-fold from 0.24 to 1.77 fmol/cell/min, and the rate of DHA internalization also increased ∼7-fold from 0.21 to 1.51 fmol/cell/min (Fig. 1, A–D). The 7-fold increase in the internalization rates for AA and DHA was statistically different (p < 0.05) from the 5-fold increase in the rate of OA internalization. In contrast, uptake of all three FAs was increased ∼3.3-fold upon differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells into adipocytes, with no statistically significant difference between PUFAs and OA (Fig. 1, A–D). Increased PUFA internalization into PC12 cells is consistent with the hypothesis that selective PUFA internalization contributes to their enrichment within the plasma membrane of neurons. To confirm that the short term FA uptake assays presented in Fig. 1 measured FA internalization and not FA binding to the plasma membrane, undifferentiated and 3-day differentiated PC12 cells were incubated for 2 min with 5 μm radiolabeled OA, AA, or DHA, and the metabolic fates of these FAs were determined by TLC and scintillation counting. Consistent with internalization, only 10–15% of the radiolabeled OA was free FA, whereas the majority was metabolized to PL, DAG, and TAG (Fig. 1E). Similar results were obtained with radio-labeled AA and DHA (data not shown). To determine whether increased availability of PUFAs in the extracellular medium alters the amount of neurite outgrowth or TAG accumulation in differentiating PC12 cells, we supplemented differentiation media that contained 0.25% horse serum in RPMI 1640 with OA, AA, or DHA bound to 15 μm of FA-free BSA, differentiated the cells for 3 days, and examined their neurite lengths and TAG levels (Fig. 2). Addition of 7.5, 15, or 30 μm OA resulted in no significant increase in neurite outgrowth compared with cells differentiated in media that were not supplemented with additional FA (Fig. 2A). However, there was a significant 95% increase in TAG levels at 30 μm OA but not at 7.5 or 15 μm (Fig. 2D). In contrast, supplementation at low concentrations of AA (7.5 or 15 μm) significantly increased aggregate neurite length by ∼70% (Fig. 2B), and the same concentrations of DHA increased aggregate neurite length by ∼40% (Fig. 2C). At 30 μm supplementation, aggregate neurite length was slightly reduced to 38% with AA supplementation and slightly increased to 51% with DHA supplementation, both still significantly different from the control (Fig. 2, B and C). Similar to OA, supplementation with 30 μm of AA or DHA increased TAG accumulation by 121 and 123%, respectively (Fig. 2D). At 15 μm, AA supplementation significantly increased TAG accumulation by 55%, whereas DHA supplementation increased TAG accumulation by 35%. However, at 7.5 μmf AA or DHA, a level that resulted in significantly increased neurite outgrowth, no change in TAG accumulation was detected. The finding that 7.5 μm PUFAs increases neurite outgrowth but not TAG synthesis in PC12 cells is consistent with the hypothesis that elevated PUFA internalization in PC12 cells is preferentially coupled with increased PL synthesis resulting in increased aggregate neurite length. Expression of ACS mRNAs in Undifferentiated and Differentiated PC12 and 3T3-L1 Cells—Because ACS proteins have been shown by several laboratories to act in concert with FATP to facilitate the internalization of FAs from the extracellular medium (12Gargiulo C.E. Stuhlsatz-Krouper S.M. Schaffer J.E. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 881-892Google Scholar, 13Zou Z. Tong F. Faergeman N.J. Borsting C. Black P.N. DiRusso C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16414-16422Google Scholar), and because different ACS isoforms activate PUFAs with different efficiencies (15Iijima H. Fujino T. Minekura H. Suzuki H. Kang M.J. Yamamoto T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 186-190Google Scholar, 16Oikawa E. Iijima H. Suzuki T. Sasano H. Sato H. Kamataki A. Nagura H. Kang M.J. Fujino T. Suzuki H. Yamamoto T.T. J. Biochem.

A. 1997; 94: 2880-2884Google Scholar, 18Fujino T. Kang M.J. Suzuki H. Iijima H. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16748-16752Google Scholar), we hypothesized that differential expression of ACS isoforms may contribute to selective PUFA internalization and PL synthesis in differentiated PC12 cells. Therefore, we performed real time PCR on undifferentiated and differentiated PC12 and 3T3-L1 cells, and identified which ACS mRNAs were present and which were induced upon differentiation of each cell type. The level of each message was normalized to cyclophilin to minimize variation between RNA samples. To control for differences in amplification rates due to variation in primer sequences, real time PCR was also performed with genomic DNA because each gene is present in exactly two copies and should therefore amplify equally. All five ACS mRNAs were present in undifferentiated PC12 cells with ACS1, ACS2, and ACS3 mRNAs equally expressed at about one-third and one-fifth the level of ACS4 and ACS5 mRNAs, respectively (Fig. 3A). Upon PC12 cell differentiation, ACS2, ACS4, and ACS5 mRNAs were significantly increased by 27, 63, and 110%, respectively, whereas levels of ACS1 and ACS3 mRNAs were unchanged. In undifferentiated 3T3-L1 cells, ACS1, ACS3, ACS4, and ACS5 mRNAs were all expressed at relatively low levels, and ACS2 mRNA was not detected (Fig. 3B). Upon 3T3-L1 differentiation, ACS1 mRNA increased ∼160-fold, whereas levels of ACS2, ACS3, ACS4, and ACS5 mRNAs remained unchanged. Induction of ACS1 mRNA is consistent with the hypotheses that ACS1 activates 16–20 carbon FAs non-specifically and promotes TAG synthesis. Because ACS2 is expressed in PC12 cells, but not 3T3-L1 cells, and because biochemical studies indicate that it activates PUFAs more readily than ACS1 (15Iijima H. Fujino T. Minekura H. Suzuki H. Kang M.J. Yamamoto T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 186-190Google Scholar), we hypothesized that ACS2 may be partly responsible for the enhanced PUFA internalization in differentiated PC12 cells and increased neurite outgrowth when differentiating cells are supplemented with PUFAs. Generation of a PC12 Cell Line That Is Efficiently Transformed by Murine Stem Cell Virus Retrovirus—In order to perform biochemical analysis, such as FA internalization or TAG levels, of cells with overexpressed ACS proteins, we require large numbers of transformed PC12 cells. However, introduction of exogenous DNA into PC12 cells by standard methods, such as transfection or retroviral infection, normally transforms less than 5% of the cells. Additionally, transgene-independent phenotypes often occur when stable PC12 cell clones are generated. We hypothesized that if we increased the number of retroviral receptors, we should increase transformation efficiency. To this end, we generated 12 stable PC12 cell lines that overexpressed the murine ecotropic receptor and examined the ability of each line to extend neurites and be infected by retrovirus, as compared with the parental cell line. Although all of the isolated clones exhibited a significant increase in their ability to be infected by retrovirus, only two clones extended neurites that were of similar length and arborization to those seen with the parental cell line. We decided to exploit clone Eco1 for our analysis because it extended neurites that were indistinguishable from wild type PC12 cells (Fig. 4, A and B) and because it was transformed nearly 2 orders of magnitude more efficiently than the parental cell line as determined by FACS analysis of GFP expression (Fig. 4, C and D). Additionally, the distribution of GFP expression per cell varied over a 100-fold range in a typical Poisson distribution (24Liu X. Constantinescu S.N. Sun Y. Bogan J.S. Hirsch D. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 20-28Google Scholar). By using Eco1 cells, we generated populations of cells that overexpressed ACS1 or ACS2 protein, and we examined how neurite outgrowth, FA internalization, and TAG levels were affected. A Method to Determine Accurately Neurite Outgrowth in Gene-altered PC12 Cells—The rate and extent of neurite outgrowth by PC12 cells are influenced by extracellular factors, such as the amount and quality of the collagen that is on the plate and the density of cells. Therefore, to determine accurately whether neurite outgrowth is altered in cells with modified levels of ACS protein, we developed a"
https://openalex.org/W2069302647,"Mutations in ABCG5 (G5) or ABCG8 (G8) cause sitosterolemia, an autosomal recessive disease characterized by sterol accumulation and premature atherosclerosis. G5 and G8 are ATP-binding cassette (ABC) half-transporters that must heterodimerize to move to the apical surface of cells. We examined the role of N-linked glycans in the formation of the G5/G8 heterodimer to gain insight into the determinants of folding and trafficking of these proteins. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that two asparagine residues (Asn585 and Asn592) are glycosylated in G5 and that G8 has a single N-linked glycan attached to Asn619. N-Linked glycosylation of G8 was required for efficient trafficking of the G5/G8 heterodimer, but mutations that abolished glycosylation of G5 did not prevent trafficking of the heterodimer. Both G5 and G8 are bound by the lectin chaperone, calnexin, suggesting that the calnexin cycle may facilitate folding of the G5/G8 heterodimer. To determine the effects of 13 disease-causing missense mutations in G5 and G8 on formation and trafficking of the G5/G8 heterodimer, mutant forms of the half-transporters were expressed in CHO-K1 cells. All 13 mutations reduced trafficking of the G5/G8 heterodimer from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex, and most prevented the formation of stable heterodimers between G5 and G8. We conclude that the majority of the molecular defects in G5 and G8 that cause sitosterolemia impair transport of the sterol transporter to the cell surface. Mutations in ABCG5 (G5) or ABCG8 (G8) cause sitosterolemia, an autosomal recessive disease characterized by sterol accumulation and premature atherosclerosis. G5 and G8 are ATP-binding cassette (ABC) half-transporters that must heterodimerize to move to the apical surface of cells.

To determine the effects of 13 disease-causing missense mutations in G5 and G8 on formation and trafficking of the G5/G8 heterodimer, mutant forms of the half-transporters were expressed in CHO-K1 cells. All 13 mutations reduced trafficking of the G5/G8 heterodimer from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex, and most prevented the formation of stable heterodimers between G5 and G8. We conclude that the majority of the molecular defects in G5 and G8 that cause sitosterolemia impair transport of the sterol transporter to the cell surface. Mutations in either ABCG5 (G5) or ABCG8 (G8) cause sitosterolemia, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the accumulation of both plant-derived (primarily sitosterol) and animal-derived sterols (cholesterol) in plasma and tissues (1Berge K.E.

In mice, G5 and G8 are located on the apical surfaces of enterocytes and hepatocytes, where they limit the absorption of dietary sterols and promote the excretion of cholesterol into bile, respectively (4Yu L.

Individuals with sitosterolemia have a generalized increase in the absorption of dietary neutral sterols and a defect in the excretion of these sterols into bile (8Miettinen T.A. Eur. J. Clin.

This impairment in sterol trafficking results in the deposition of neutral sterols in the skin as xanthomas and in the walls of the coronary arteries, causing premature atherosclerosis. G5 and G8 are both glycoproteins (11Graf G.A. Li W.-P. Gerard R.D. Gelissen I. White A. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 659-669Google Scholar). If G5 or G8 is expressed alone in cultured cells it is retained in the ER, 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ABC, ATP-binding cassette; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; HA, hemagglutinin; IP buffer, immunoprecipitation buffer; mAb, monoclonal antibody; pAb, polyclonal antibody; PNGase F, peptide N-glycosidase F; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. and its glycans remain sensitive to endoglycosidase H, an enzyme that removes immature, high mannose N-linked glycans that have not been processed to mature oligosaccharides in the Golgi complex. If both proteins are expressed in the same cell, the N-linked sugars become insensitive to endoglycosidase H and sensitive to neuraminidase, which cleaves sialic acid residues added in the trans-Golgi complex. As G5 and G8 transit from the ER to the cell surface, the changes in glycan structure result in an increase in the apparent molecular mass of each protein when analyzed by immunoblotting. ABC half-transporters must homodimerize or heterodimerize with another family member to transport substrates across membranes. Several lines of evidence suggest that G5 and G8 are obligate heterodimers and that the formation of G5/G8 heterodimers is required for normal sterol transport. First, mutations in either ABCG5 or ABCG8 have identical clinical and biochemical sequelae (1Berge K.E. Tian H. Graf G.A. Yu L. Grishin N.V. Schultz J. Kwiterovich P. Shan B. Barnes R. Hobbs H.H.

The two genes are located in a head-to-head orientation on chromosome 2, have similar tissue- and cell-specific patterns of expression, and are coordinately regulated (1Berge K.E. Tian H. Graf G.A.

These features are consistent with the two genes being expressed from a divergent promoter, a feature found in other genes encoding protein constituents of functional complexes (17Pollner R.

Next, the expression of both G5 and G8 is required for trafficking of either protein to the cell surface, and the two proteins coimmunoprecipitate when coexpressed in cultured cells (11Graf G.A. Li W.-P. Gerard R.D. Gelissen I. White A. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 659-669Google Scholar). Although it remains possible that homodimers of either G5 or G8 form and are functional, the activity of these homodimers must be confined to the ER because homodimeric complexes do not exit this organelle. Lastly, increased sterol excretion into bile of G5/G8-deficient mice required coexpression of G5 and G8 (20Graf G.A. Yu L. Li W.P. Gerard R. Tuma P.L. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48275-48282Google Scholar). Several human diseases are caused by mutations that prevent the proper folding of ABC transporters in the ER (21Aridor M. Hannan L.A.

For example, more than 70% of individuals with cystic fibrosis have a mutation that results in failure of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) to reach the cell membrane (23Johnston J.A.

Biol. 1992; 7: 485-491Google Scholar); however, it is not known whether missense mutations in half-transporters such as G5 and G8 impair trafficking of the heterodimer. To determine whether disease causing missense mutations disrupt trafficking of the G5/G8 heterodimer, we first characterized the role of N-linked glycans in dimer formation and trafficking of this transporter. The amino acids in G5 and G8 to which the N-linked glycans are attached were mapped, and the roles of N-linked glycans in chaperone interaction, dimer formation, and ER to Golgi translocation of G5/G8 were examined. The processing of the N-linked glycans on G5 and G8 was then monitored to determine the effect of disease-causing, missense mutations in ABCG5 and ABCG8 on the trafficking of heterodimers containing mutant G5 or G8 in cultured cells. The results indicate that the majority of disease-causing mutations in G5 and G8 impair transport of the G5/G8 heterodimer beyond the ER. Cell Culture—CHO-K1 cells (ATCC) were cultured in Ham's F-12 and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 50% (v/v) containing 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) in a humidified incubator (8.8% CO2). CRL-1601 cells stably expressing G5, G8, or both proteins were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (glucose, 1 g/liter) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 500 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen), and 500 μg/ml Zeocin in a humidified incubator (5% CO2). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Single-bp changes in mouse ABCG5 and ABCG8 cDNA expression constructs (11Graf G.A. Li W.-P. Gerard R.D. Gelissen I. White A. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin.

Chem. 2003; 278: 48275-48282Google Scholar) were introduced using sense and antisense oligonucleotides (27-mer) containing the mutant base(s) in the central codon. Each mutation was generated with Pfu- Turbo (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), dNTPs, and the appropriate oligonucleotide pair (18 cycles of 94 °C, 45 s; 65 °C, 45 s; 68 °C, 18 min). After PCR, template DNA was removed by digestion with DpnI endonuclease, and the reaction components were removed with a QiaQuick Spin column (Qiagen, Germany). The amplified DNA was transformed into Escherichia coli XL10 Gold ultracompetent cells (Stratagene). The presence of the desired mutation and fidelity of each construct were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transfections and Cell Lysates—CHO-K1 cells were seeded (1 × 105 cells/dish) in 35-mm dishes. Expression plasmids (1 μg/dish) were transiently transfected into CHO-K1 cells using FuGENE (6 μl of FuGENE/μg of DNA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The appearance of the fully processed form of G5 was enhanced by coexpressing an excess of normal G8. Similarly, maturation of G8 was enhanced by coexpression of excess G5. To provide optimum conditions for trafficking, each mutant construct was coexpressed with a 2-fold excess of its normal partner. Cell lysates were prepared 48 h after transfection. Cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, incubated in 0.3 ml of Triton lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 80 mm NaCl, 2mm CaCl2, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, pH 8) for 30 min at 4 °C, and harvested by scraping with a rubber policeman. Cells and lysis buffer were transferred to 1.5-ml tubes and centrifuged for 15 min (15,000 × g, 4 °C). Supernatants were transferred to new 1.5-ml tubes and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Analysis of Glycosylation—CHO-K1 cells were transiently transfected with epitope-tagged murine G5, G8, and the expression constructs containing mutations. G5 contained three copies of the Myc epitope and G8 contained three copies of a HA epitope, each at the C terminus (11Graf G.A. Li W.-P. Gerard R.D. Gelissen I. White A. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 659-669Google Scholar). Proteins were denatured by heating in 0.5% SDS, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol (95 °C, 5 min) and incubated in the presence or absence of 10 units of N-glycosidase F (PNGase F, Calbiochem) in 60 mm Tris, pH 8.6, and 1% (w/v) Triton X-100. Samples were diluted with protein sample buffer, heated to 95 °C for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblot Analysis of G5 and G8—Protein concentrations of cell lysates and fractions were determined using the Bio-Rad Dc assay according to the manufacturer's protocol. Protein sample buffer was added to a final concentration of 1×, and samples were heated to 95 °C for 5 min. Proteins were size fractionated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels at 50 mA and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose membranes at 50 V for 2 h. Membranes were incubated in buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20, 5% milk) for 60 min at 22 °C prior to the addition of primary antibodies. Primary antibodies were diluted in buffer A and incubated with membranes for 60 min at 22 °C. Membranes were washed three times for 5 min in buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20, 0.2% nonfat milk). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG or goat anti-mouse IgG (Pierce) was diluted (1:20,000) and incubated with membranes for 60 min at 22 °C. Membranes were washed three times for 5 min in buffer B and visualized using SuperSignal® enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Protein loading was assessed by visual inspection of Ponceau S-stained membranes. Immunoisolation—Coimmunoprecipitation of G5 and G8 was conducted essentially as described previously (20Graf G.A. Yu L. Li W.P. Gerard R. Tuma P.L. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48275-48282Google Scholar). Transfected CHO-K1 cells or CRL-1601 cells harboring empty plasmids or plasmids containing cDNAs encoding G5, G8, or both G5 and G8 (11Graf G.A. Li W.-P. Gerard R.D. Gelissen I. White A. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 659-669Google Scholar) were grown to 90% confluence in 100-mm plates. Cells were washed twice with prechilled detergent-free IP buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2) and scraped on ice in 1 ml of freshly prepared IP buffer containing 0.5% (w/v) digitonin (Calbiochem). Cells were passed through a 25-gauge needle 20 times, transferred to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and incubated at 4 °C on a rotator for 30 min. Samples were centrifuged for 15 min (15,000 × g, 4 °C) and supernatants were transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube. Antibodies (10 μg) directed against the epitope tags at the C terminus of G5 (Myc, 9E10) or G8 (HA, 12CA5) and protein A-agarose (20 μl) were added, and samples were incubated for 16 h (4 °C, with rotation). Protein A-bound antibodies and proteins were separated from supernatants by centrifugation (15 s, 800 × g) and washed three times for 15 min in IP buffer (4 °C). For precipitations with pAbs directed against calnexin and calreticulin, antisera were prebound to protein A-agarose and washed with IP buffer to remove serum proteins. Immunoprecipitation experiments also were conducted in magnesium free IP buffer supplemented with 5 mm EDTA. Results were identical in the presence or absence of the divalent cation. Blue Native PAGE—Total cellular membranes were prepared from transiently transfected CHO-K1 cells and subjected to native-PAGE (28Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Google Scholar). Cells were equilibrated and harvested on ice in membrane buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.4 mm EGTA, 4 °C), lysed by passing 20 times through a 25-gauge needle, and centrifuged (1,000 × g, 4 °C, 5 min) to remove cellular debris and nuclei. Supernatants were transferred to TLA 100.2 tubes and centrifuged (100,000 × g, 4 °C, 60 min) to pellet membranes. Supernatants were aspirated, and membrane pellets were solubilized in EGTA-free membrane buffer containing 1% (w/v) C12E9 by passing through a 25-gauge needle (10 times) and incubating for 30 min at 4 °C on a rotator. The insoluble fraction was removed by centrifugation (15,000 × g,4 °C, 15 min). Supernatants were collected, and blue native loading buffer (50 mm BisTris, pH 7.0, 750 mm 6-aminocaproic acid, 7 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% v/v glycerol, 5% w/v Coomassie G-250) was added to a final concentration of 1×. Samples were loaded onto a 5-15% (w/v) acrylamide gradient gel prepared in native gel (100 mm BisTris, pH 7.0, 1 m 6-aminocaproic acid, 15% (v/v) glycerol) and electrophoresed (cathode, 50 mm Tricine, 15 mm BisTris, 0.02% w/v Coomassie G250, pH 7.0; anode, 50 mm BisTris, pH 7.0; 150 V, 16-18 h, 4 °C). Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were washed in methanol to remove Coomassie Blue stain and subjected to immunoblot analysis as described above. Mapping N-Linked Glycosylation Sites—Mouse G5 contains canonical N-linked glycosylation sequences (NXS/T) at asparagine positions 437, 585, and 592 (Fig. 1A). Two of these sites (Asn585 and Asn592) are conserved between mice and humans. The third (Asn437) nonconserved site is predicted to reside within a cytoplasmic loop and is not expected to be modified (Fig. 1A). Mouse G8 contains five canonical N-linked sites. Three of these (Asn at 90, 160, and 619) are conserved between mice and humans, but only Asn619 is expected to be utilized because Asn90 and Asn160 are predicted to be in cytoplasmic regions of the protein. To determine which of the canonical N-linked glycosylation sites are utilized in G5 and G8, site-directed mutagenesis was used to replace the candidate asparagine (N) codons with glutamine (Q) codons in the mG5-Myc and mG8-HA cDNAs. The N-glycosylation status of the normal and mutant proteins was analyzed in transiently transfected CHO-K1 cells (Fig. 1B). Cell lysates were prepared and incubated in the presence or absence of PNGase F, which removes all N-linked glycans, and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. The precursor form of G5 has an apparent molecular mass of 70-72 kDa, whereas the apparent mass of the mature form ranges from 85 to 100 kDa. When the normal forms of the two half-transporters were coexpressed, the mature forms of the protein predominated. Mutation of Asn437 to glutamine (construct QNN) in G5 had no effect on its apparent molecular mass, whereas mutation of either Asn585 (construct NQN) or Asn592 (construct NNQ) resulted in a decrease in the apparent molecular mass of the mature protein. No mature forms of the protein were present when both Asn585 and Asn592 were changed to glutamine (NQQ) or when all three asparagines were changed to glutamine (QQQ). The reductions in apparent molecular mass of normal (NNN), Asn585 (NQN), or Asn592 (NNQ) G5 after PNGase F treatment indicated that each of these proteins contained at least one N-linked glycan. In contrast to these results, no change in size of the proteins was seen with PNGase F treatment when both Asn585 and Asn592 (NQQ) or when all three positions (QQQ) were changed to glutamine. Collectively, these data indicate that amino acids 585 and 592 are the sites to which the N-linked glycans are added in mouse G5. An identical strategy was used to identify sites of N-linked glycosylation in G8. Mouse G8 contains a potential N-linked glycosylation site at residue 369, which resides N-terminal to the first predicted membrane spanning segment (Fig 1A). Mutation of Asn369 (QN) had no effect on the size of the protein or its sensitivity to PNGase F (Fig. 1B). Substitution of glutamine for asparagine at position 619 (NQ), alone or together with substitution of a glutamine for asparagine at amino acid 369 (QQ), reduced the apparent molecular mass of the untreated proteins and rendered them resistant to PNGase F, indicating that neither protein contained N-linked sugars. Collectively, these data indicate that mouse G8 contains a single N-linked glycan at position 619. Effect of N-Linked Glycans on Trafficking of the G5/G8 Heterodimer—When recombinant G5 or G8 is expressed in cultured cells, each protein is retained in the ER unless coexpressed with its dimerization partner (11Graf G.A. Li W.-P. Gerard R.D. Gelissen I. White A. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 659-669Google Scholar). To determine whether N-linked glycosylation was required for trafficking of the G5/G8 heterodimer beyond the ER, nonglycosylated forms of either G5 or G8 were coexpressed in cells with their normal partners. The ability of the glycan-deficient forms of G5 and G8 to support trafficking of the heterodimer was determined by monitoring the apparent molecular mass of the normal partner (Fig. 2A). Mutation of the glycosylation sites in G5 did not affect the relative amounts of mature and immature forms of G8. However, there was a decrease in the abundance of both forms of G8 when it was coexpressed with glycan-deficient G5 (NQQ and QQQ). In addition, the mature form of G8 exhibited a slightly condensed pattern with greater electrophoretic mobility. In contrast, expression of glycan-deficient G8 (NQ and QQ) markedly reduced the ratio of mature to immature G5. Thus, efficient transport of the G5/G8 heterodimer out of the ER to the Golgi complex is dependent on the addition of N-linked sugars to G8, but not to G5. It remains possible that the substitution of glutamine for asparagine at amino acid 619 in G8 reduces the efficiency of G5/G8 trafficking independently of N-linked glycosylation. Consequently, two additional mutations were made in G8; codon 619 was changed from asparagine to alanine (NA), and a new canonical N-linked site was introduced seven amino acids upstream of residue 619 in glycan-deficient G8 (NNQ). Loss of the N-linked site in G8, either by substitution to an alanine or to a glutamine, greatly diminished or abolished trafficking of the G5/G8 heterodimer out of the ER (Fig. 2B). Introduction of an N-linked site at position 612 of G8-N619Q (NNQ) partially restored trafficking of the G5/G8 heterodimer. These data are consistent with N-linked glycosylation of G8 being required for the efficient trafficking of the G5/G8 heterodimer. Effect of G8 Glycosylation on G5/G8 Dimer Formation—To determine whether the reduction in trafficking of the glycan-deficient G8 was the result of a failure to dimerize with G5, two different experiments were performed (Fig. 3). First, we determined whether glycan-deficient forms of G5 and G8 coimmunoprecipitated with their normal partners when expressed together in cells (Fig. 3A). When either normal or glycan-deficient G8 was coexpressed with G5, more than half of the G8 coprecipitated with G5. To ensure that the coimmunoprecipitation of glycan-deficient G8 with G5 represented G5/G8 dimers rather than coaggregated proteins, microsomal proteins from cells expressing either G5 or G8 alone or G5 in the presence of normal or glycan-deficient forms of G8 were subjected to native gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3B). G5 migrated as a broad, very high molecular mass band (≥670 kDa) when expressed alone in cells; this band is presumed to represent aggregated G5. When G5 was coexpressed with glycosylated forms of G8 (NN or QN) almost all of the protein migrated as a single band with a molecular mass of ∼150 kDa, the predicted size of a G5/G8 heterodimer. Glycan-deficient forms of G8 enabled some G5 to migrate in the lower molecular mass form, although a significant fraction of the G5 remained in high molecular mass aggregates. When expressed alone, G8 was poorly resolved on native gels. Immunoblotting revealed that a portion of the protein migrated as a diffuse band of ∼140 kDa. Coexpression of G5 increased the amount of G8 detected on the blot and increased the apparent mass to ∼150 kDa. These shifts appeared to be somewhat greater for the glycosylated forms (NN, NQ) of G8 than for the nonglycosylated forms (NQ and QQ). Levels of normal and mutant G8 were similar when analyzed by SDS-PAGE, indicating that differences in the signal intensities of the various constructs observed on native gels did not reflect differences in protein expression. Taken together, these findings suggest that glycosylation of G8 is not required for dimerization with G5 but is required for efficient transport of the two proteins out of the ER. Lectins Coimmunoprecipitate with G5 and G8—To determine whether the ER lectins calnexin and calreticulin associate with G5 and G8, we performed coimmunoprecipitation studies in cells that stably expressed empty plasmids, G5-Myc (5Yu L. Hammer R.E. Li-Hawkins J. von Bergmann K. Lutjohann D. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16237-16242Google Scholar), G8-HA (8Miettinen T.A. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 10: 27-35Google Scholar), or G5-Myc and G8-HA (5+8, Fig. 4). Calnexin coprecipitated with G5 in the presence or in the absence of G8. Calnexin coimmunoprecipitated with G8 in the absence of G5, but only trace amounts of calnexin coprecipitated with G8 in the presence of G5 (as judged by long exposures of the gel; data not shown). Under these conditions, associations between G5 or G8 and GRP-94 or Bip were not detected (Fig. 4). Nor were ERp57, ERp53, or protein disulfide isomerase found in association with G5 or G8 (data not shown). Calreticulin precipitated nonspecifically with agarose beads in these experiments, therefore we used antibodies to calreticulin to determine whether G5 and G8 associated with this chaperone (Fig. 4B). pAbs to calreticulin and calnexin were prebound to protein A-agarose and washed extensively prior to incubation with cell lysates. In cells expressing G5 alone anti-calnexin antibodies coimmunoprecipitated a form of G5 with slightly reduced mobility relative to that which remained in the supernatant. In cells expressing G5 and G8, calnexin immunoprecipitated a form of G5 of the same molecular mass as that observed in cells expressing G5 alone, but the mature form of G5 remained in the supernatant. A similar pattern was observed for G8; calnexin immunoprecipitated the lower molecular mass form of G8, but the higher molecular mass, mature form remained in the supernatant. Thus, both immature G5 and G8 are bound by calnexin, suggesting that calnexin participates in the folding of these proteins. No G5 and only a trace amount of G8 coimmunoprecipitated with calreticulin, suggesting that calreticulin does not participate in the folding of the G5/G8 heterodimer. Glycan Dependence of G5 and G8 Binding to Calnexin—To determine whether the N-linked glycans on G5 and G8 were required for calnexin binding, CHO-K1 cells were transiently transfected with normal or glycan-deficient forms of G5 and G8 (Fig. 5). The ability of calnexin to associate with each form of G5 and G8 was assessed by immunoprecipitation. Calnexin coimmunoprecipitated with G5 when it contained either two (NNN, QNN) or one (NQN, NNQ) N-linked glycans but failed to associate with glycan-deficient G5 (NQQ, QQQ) (Fig. 5A). For G8, calnexin associated with both the glycosylated G8 (NN, QN) and the nonglycosylated forms of G8 (NQ, QQ), although the association was stronger for the glycosylated forms of the half-transporter. Trafficking of G5 and G8 Mutants—The appearance of high molecular mass forms of G5 and G8 indicates that they have escaped the ER quality control system and reached the Golgi complex. We monitored the appearance of these forms of G5 and G8 to determine the effects of disease-causing missense mutations on the trafficking of the G5/G8 dimer. The 13 reported missense mutations are shown in Fig. 6 (1Berge K.E. Tian H. Graf G.A. Yu L. Grishin N.V. Schultz J. Kwiterovich P. Shan B. Barnes R. Hobbs H.H.

A detailed functional study of the behavior of the intact magnesium chelatase has been performed, including characterization of magnesium cooperativity and the stoichiometry of ATP consumption in relation to the magnesium porphyrin produced. It is demonstrated that, <i>in vitro</i>, this catalyzed reaction requires hydrolysis of ∼15 MgATP<sup>2–</sup> and that the chelation partial reaction is energetically unfavorable, under our assay conditions, with a Δ<i>G</i>°′ of 25–33 kJ mol<sup>–1</sup>. Given the likely metabolite concentrations <i>in vivo</i>, this results in the chelatase reaction operating far from equilibrium. We have also determined the steady-state kinetic behavior of the intact enzyme and have compared the kinetic parameters obtained with those observed for the partial reactions of individual subunits. <i>K</i><sub>DIX</sub> (where D<sub>IX</sub> represents deuteroporphyrin IX) is estimated to be 3.20 μm, and <i>K</i><sub>MgATP</sub><sup>2–</sup> is 0.45 mm. <i>k</i><sub>cat</sub> for chelation is estimated to be 0.8 min<sup>–1</sup>, suggesting that the ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by the isolated ChlI subunit is substantially slower in the intact chelatase. The magnesium-rich form of the chelatase is a more effective catalyst of the chelation reaction; magnesium activation of the chelatase increases <i>V</i>, as well as the specificity constant for the reaction of MgATP<sup>2–</sup> and D<sub>IX</sub>, possibly as a result of a magnesium-triggered conformational change."
https://openalex.org/W2031037701,"Apolipoprotein (apo) E4 is a major risk factor for Alzheimer disease. Although the mechanisms remain to be determined, the detrimental effects of apoE4 in neurobiology must be based on its unique structural and biophysical properties. One such property is domain interaction mediated by a salt bridge between Arg-61 in the N-terminal domain and Glu-255 in the C-terminal domain of apoE4. This interaction, which does not occur in apoE3 or apoE2, causes apoE4 to bind preferentially to certain lipoprotein particles in vitro and in vivo. Here we used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to determine whether apoE4 domain interaction occurs in living neuronal cells. Neuro-2a cells were transfected with constructs encoding apoE3 or apoE4 in which yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) was fused to the N terminus, and cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) was fused to the C terminus. To generate a FRET signal that can be detected by spectrum confocal microscopy, the labeled N and C termini must be in close proximity (<100 Å). FRET signals occurred in cells transfected with YFP-apoE4-CFP but not in those transfected with YFP-apoE3-CFP, suggesting that the N and C termini of apoE4 are in close proximity in living cells and that those of apoE3 are not. FRET signals did not occur in cells cotransfected with YFP-apoE4 and apoE4-CFP, suggesting that the FRET in YFP-apoE4-CFP-transfected cells was intramolecular. Mutation of Arg-61 to Thr or Glu-255 to Ala in apoE4, which disrupts domain interaction, abolished FRET in Neuro-2a cells, strongly suggesting that the FRET in YFP-apoE4-CFP cells was caused by domain interaction. ApoE4-producing cells secreted less phospholipid than apoE3-producing cells, but after disruption of domain interaction in apoE4, phospholipid secretion increased to the levels seen with apoE3, suggesting that domain interaction decreases the phospholipid-binding capacity of apoE4. Thus, apoE4 domain interaction occurs in living neuronal cells and may be a molecular basis for apoE4-related neurodegeneration. Apolipoprotein (apo) E4 is a major risk factor for Alzheimer disease.

Other pheromones are predicted to be released during egg laying that act in concert with albumen gland attractin to stimulate attraction, but their identities are unknown. To identify other candidate water-borne pheromones, we employed differential library screening of an albumen gland cDNA library, Northern blot analysis, purification, characterization, cloning, and expression of albumen gland proteins, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry, pheromone secretion assays, behavioral bioassays, immunolocalization studies, and comparative genomics. Four genes, Alb-23, Alb-24, Alb-69, and Alb-172, were highly expressed in Aplysia californica albumen glands and encoded novel proteins. The products of the Alb-24 (“enticin”) and Alb-172 (“temptin”) precursors were soluble and highly abundant in albumen gland extracts, whereas Alb-23 and Alb-69 were membrane-associated proteins. A comparative analysis showed that the predicted Aplysia brasiliana enticin and temptin proteins were 90 and 91% identical, respectively, to their A. californica homologs. T-maze attraction bioassay studies have previously demonstrated that egg cordons alone are attractive to Aplysia but that attractin alone is not.

A supergene family encodes them, and the member proteins exist as multiple forms having distinct yet overlapping substrate specificities. Multiple forms of P450, which are selectively induced or inhibited by a variety of drugs, are known to exist in liver, the major organ involved in P450-mediated metabolism (1de Montellano O. Cytochrome P-450: Structure, Mechanism and Biochemistry. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). However, the potential to generate active metabolite(s) at the site of action has generated interest in extrahepatic P450. This has prompted extensive investigations into the xenobiotic metabolizing capability of extrahepatic organs, such as lung, kidney, skin, and nasal epithelium, and the far reaching consequences of such metabolism, in situ, within specific cells in target organs have been recognized in laboratory animals (2Gram T.E. Okine L.K. Gram R.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1986; 26: 259-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and humans (3McLemore T.L. Litterest C.C. Coudert B.P. Liu M.C. Hubbard W.C. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 1420-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The preferential localization of drug-metabolizing enzymes within specific cell types in these organs renders such cells significantly capable of metabolizing drugs (4Boyd M.R. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1980; 7: 103-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Thus, even minor metabolic pathways of xenobiotic metabolism can produce major effects if they take place at the site of action. These observations have prompted investigation into P450-associated monooxygenases in brain with an effort to determine the capability of the brain to metabolize psychoactive drugs (5Ravindranath V. Boyd M.R. Drug Metab. Rev. 1995; 27: 419-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 6Hedlund E. Gustafsson J.A. Warner M. Drug Metab. 2001; 2: 245-263Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). P450-mediated metabolism of psychoactive drugs directly in the brain can lead to local pharmacological modulation at the site of action and result in variable drug response.The interindividual variability in hepatic metabolism of drugs caused by genetic polymorphism exhibited by some forms of P450 such as P4502D6 are reflected in the plasma levels of administered drugs. But plasma drug levels often show poor correlation with therapeutic effect (7Kalow W. Tyndale R.F. Pharmacogenetics of Drug Metabolism. Pergamon Press, New York1992Google Scholar), suggesting that metabolism within the brain could influence the therapeutic outcome regardless of hepatic clearance and plasma drug levels. A moderate difference in the pharmacokinetics of psychoactive drugs often leads to dramatic pharmacodynamic effects, again suggesting that metabolism in situ within the brain could play a significant role (8Brosen K. Sindrup S.H. Skjelbo E. Nielsen K.K. Gram L.F. Psychopharmacol.

CYP2D is one of the major forms of P450 present in both rat (15Komori M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and human brain (16Chinta S.J. Pai H.V. Upadhya S.C. Boyd M.R. Ravindranath V. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2002; 103: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Significant differences are seen in the regulation and function of the isoforms of brain P450 compared with the hepatic forms (17Wang H. Strobel H.W. Arch. Biochem.

These observations have indicated the possible existence of unique P450 isoforms in brain that are different from the well characterized hepatic P450s. We report here the presence of a unique form of CYP2D7 that is generated by alternate splicing in human brain but not in liver or kidney.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESHuman brain was obtained from Human Brain Tissue Repository, NIMHANS, India. The tissue was collected at autopsy from male and female traffic accident victims with no known neurological or psychiatric disorders. The average age of the individuals was 35.4 years (3–70 years), and postmortem delay between death and autopsy was 7.3 ± 3.7 h. A region representing exon 6–9of CYP2D6 (333 bp) was amplified by RT 2The abbreviations used are: RT, reverse transcription; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography.-PCR with forward and reverse primers 5′-TGATGAGAACCTGCGCATAG-3′ and 3′-ACCGATGACAGGTTGGTGAT-5′, respectively, using human cortex mRNA and used for screening a human cortex cDNA library constructed in our laboratory using Lambda ZAPII library construction kit (Stratagene, La Jolla). Three positive clones of ∼1.2, 1.5, and 1.8 kb were isolated and sequenced. The 1.8-kb clone referred to as brain variant CYP2D7 (GenBank accession number AY220845) containing an open reading frame was used for further investigations.Expression of Brain Variant CYP2D7—In vitro translation was carried out using a TNT T3-coupled reticulocyte system (Promega, Madison, WI) and brain variant CYP2D7 cDNA. The translated products were examined by immunoblot using antibody to CYP2D6 (Gentest, San Jose, CA) (19Pai H.V. Upadhya S.C. Chinta S.J. Hegde S.N. Ravindranath V. Pharmacogenomics J. 2002; 2: 243-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Luciferase cDNA provided by the manufacturer was used as a positive control. The cDNA of brain variant CYP2D7 was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (+/-), sequence verified, and transfected into Neuro2a cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Positive clones were selected using neomycin. Cells were harvested, and a membrane preparation containing both mitochondria and microsomes was prepared as described earlier (16Chinta S.J. Pai H.V. Upadhya S.C. Boyd M.R. Ravindranath V. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2002; 103: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Neuro2a cells were also grown in chamber slides and processed for immunohistochemistry using antibody to CYP2D6. Immunostaining was visualized by incubation with biotinylated secondary antibody followed by streptavidin-fluorescein. cDNA to brain variant CYP2D7 ligated in the reverse orientation was used as a control in transfection experiments.RT-PCR and Genomic DNA Amplification—RT-PCR was carried out using cDNA synthesized from total RNA of 12 autopsy human brain samples. PCR was performed using the forward and reverse primers, 5′-GGCCAAGGGGAACCCTGAGA-3′ and 5′-GGTCATACCCAGGGGGACGA-3′, respectively. Two PCR products of 340 bp (809–1148 bp of brain variant CYP2D7) and 282 bp (843–1125 bp of CYP2D6, GenBank accession number M20403) were amplified.Genomic DNA was extracted from human brain cortex or blood and PCR amplified using forward and reverse primers, 5′-CTTCCTGCTCCTGGTGGA-3′ and 5′-CACCCCCTTCATCCTCGA-3′, respectively, spanning 506 bp of the partial sequences of exon 1 and intron 1 of the genomic sequence of CYP2D7 (45–551 bp relative to the ATG start codon of the genomic sequence of CYP2D7; GenBank accession number NG_002362). PCR products were examined by electrophoresis and sequenced.Localization of Brain Variant CYP2D7 by in Situ Hybridization— The 340-bp RT-PCR product was ligated into pCRII vector, and digoxigenin-labeled sense and antisense riboprobes were generated. In situ hybridization was performed using paraffin-embedded sections of brain, liver, and kidney from the same individual. Digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes were also generated from the cDNA to CYP2D6 (GenBank accession number M20403). Human brain cortex, liver, and kidney obtained at autopsy from the same individual were fixed in buffered paraformaldehyde (4%, w/v) prior to paraffin embedding. Serial sections (8–10 μm thick) were cut under RNase-free conditions. Sections were dewaxed, hydrated in graded ethanol, acetylated, and treated with proteinase K. The sections were then rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and dehydrated using graded ethanol. Sections were hybridized overnight with the digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes. After hybridization sections were washed, incubated with blocking reagent (0.5%, w/v, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) followed by antibody to digoxigenin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. After washing, sections were incubated with biotinylated tyramine followed by streptavidin-fluorescein. Finally the sections were washed, dried, and mounted prior to examination under fluorescence microscope.Preparation of Antiserum to Brain Variant CYP2D7—An antigen derived from the 19-amino acid peptide (GRRVSPGCSPIVGTHVCPV) representing 57 bp of intron 6 of brain variant CYP2D7 was conjugated to bovine serum albumin at the N-terminal end and used to generate antiserum to brain variant CYP2D7 in rabbits. The antiserum was verified for lack of cross-reactivity with P4502D6 and used for immunoblotting.Immunoblotting with Membrane Preparations from Human Brain— Brain membrane preparations containing microsomal and mitochondrial protein (200 μg each) isolated from the cortex obtained at autopsy from the 12 human subjects were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (19Pai H.V. Upadhya S.C. Chinta S.J. Hegde S.N. Ravindranath V. Pharmacogenomics J. 2002; 2: 243-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The blots were incubated sequentially with antiserum to brain variant CYP2D7 (1:200 dilution) overnight at 4 °C and anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (1:1,000 dilution) for 2 h at room temperature. Color was developed using chromogenic substrates for the alkaline phosphatase.Assay of P450 and Metabolism of Codeine—Brain variant CYP2D7 was expressed in Neuro2a cells as described above, and the membrane preparation containing both mitochondria and microsomes was isolated. Total cytochrome P450 content in membrane preparation was measured from a carbon monoxide reduced minus oxidized difference spectrum (9Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Shankar S.K. Ravindranath V. Brain Res. 1990; 536: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Membrane preparation (150 μg of protein) was incubated at 37 °C in Tris-HCl (50 mm, pH 7.4) containing 20 mm MgCl2, 1 unit of purified liver NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (20Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Boyd M.R. Ravindranath V. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and 0.01–1 mm codeine. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 1 mm NADPH and stopped after 30 min by addition of acetonitrile (10% of total volume). The samples were centrifuged, filtered, and used for HPLC analysis. Blank reactions did not contain NADPH. HPLC analysis was performed using mobile phase consisting of 40 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), acetonitrile, and tetrahydrofuran in the ratio of 89:10:1 (v/v). Formation of metabolites was detected using a fluorescence detector set at 286 and 360 nm for excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. Standard morphine, codeine, and norcodeine obtained from the National Institute of Drug Abuse was used for quantitation of metabolites. Brain variant CYP2D7 ligated in the reverse orientation was also transfected in Neuro2a cells and used as control.Localization of Brain Variant P4502D7 and μ-Opiate Receptor in Human Brain—Serial transverse sections (10 μm thick) were cut from a paraffin-embedded periaqueductal gray region of a human brain and processed for immunohistochemistry as described earlier (16Chinta S.J. Pai H.V. Upadhya S.C. Boyd M.R. Ravindranath V. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2002; 103: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Sections were incubated with antisera to brain variant CYP2D7, μ-opioid receptor (Sigma), or nonimmune serum and immunostaining was detected using an ABC Elite Kit (Vector Laboratories).RESULTSIdentification of Splice Variants of CYP2D7 from a Human Brain cDNA Library—We investigated the presence of brain-specific P450 by screening a human brain cortex cDNA library using a 333-bp amplicon generated by RT-PCR of human brain mRNA representing exons 6–9 of CYP2D6. Three positive clones were selected, and DNA sequencing identified them as splice variants of CYP2D7 having exon 3 deletion, partial inclusion of intron 6, or both (Fig. 1). Exon 3 deletion results in a premature stop codon (TGA) at 606 bp relative to the ATG start codon, and therefore the clones having exon 3 deletion were not investigated further. The third clone, 1776 bp long (GenBank accession number AY220845) with an open reading frame of 1551 bp, had an additional 57 bp from intron 6 and an intact exon 3 of the CYP2D7 genomic sequence (GenBank accession NG_002362). A frameshift mutation 138delT (relative to ATG) modifies the stop codon TGA to GAG enabling the complete translation of the pseudogene CYP2D7.Expression and Functional Activity of Brain Variant CYP2D7—The clone, which we named brain variant CYP2D7, translated in vitro in a rabbit reticulocyte system into a 58-kDa protein, which was immunochemically similar to hepatic P4502D6 (Fig. 2A). The brain variant CYP2D7 was transfected in Neuro 2a cells, and the expressed protein was assessed for P450 activity. The reduced carbon monoxide difference spectrum of the expressed protein had an absorption maximum at 450 nm characteristic of P450 (Fig. 2B; specific content = 1.03 nmol of P450/mg of protein). The expressed protein could also be detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 2C) and localized by immunohistochemistry using antibody to P4502D6 (Fig. 2D). Neuro2a cells, per se, and those transfected with the cDNA in the reverse orientation did not have any detectable P450 as observed by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2D) or by the reduced carbon monoxide difference spectrum (data not shown).Fig. 2Expression of brain variant CYP2D7 and assay of P450 level.A, brain variant CYP2D7 cDNA was expressed in a rabbit reticulocyte system. Lane 1 contained a positive luciferase control stained with anti-luciferase antibody. Lane 2 was loaded with an expression system containing the vector alone, and lanes 3 and 4 contained an expression system containing cDNA to brain variant CYP2D7. The blot was immunostained with antibody to CYP2D6. Arrows indicate the molecular mass of the immunostained protein. B, dithionite-reduced carbon monoxide binding spectrum of membrane preparations from Neuro2a cells expressing brain variant CYP2D7 protein. An absorption maximum at 450 nm is characteristic of cytochrome P450 proteins. The specific content of cytochrome P450 was 1.03 nmol of P450/mg of protein. C, expression of brain variant CYP2D7 protein in Neuro2a cells. Lanes 1, 3, and 5, which contain mitochondria and microsomes from cells transfected with vector containing the cDNA to brain variant CYP2D7 in reverse orientation, do not show any immunostaining. Immunostained bands were seen in lanes 2, 4, and 6 containing mitochondria and microsomes from different batches of Neuro2a cells expressing the brain variant CYP2D7 protein. Blots were immunostained with antibody to CYP2D6. All lanes contained 50 μg of protein. D, immunohistochemical localization of CYP2D7 in Neuro2a cells expressing brain variant CYP2D7. Cells expressing brain variant CYP2D7 showed intense cytosolic staining (a). Cells transfected with expression vector containing cDNA to brain variant CYP2D7 in the reverse direction showed no staining (c).

The generation of the 340-bp amplicon indicated the expression of the brain variant CYP2D7. Expression of CYP2D6 represented by the 282-bp amplicon was seen in all 12 human brain samples examined (see Fig. 3A). The primers used for RT-PCR amplified both CYP2D6 and CYP2D7 because of the considerable similarity (98%) between CYP2D6 and CYP2D7 in the exon 6 region. However, the 57-bp sequence of intron 6 present in brain variant CYP2D7 shares only 77% similarity with the corresponding region in CYP2D6. Thus, the 340-bp RT-PCR product represents the brain variant CYP2D7 exclusively and was seen in 6 of the 12 samples examined.Fig. 3Expression of brain variant CYP2D7 and CYP2D6 in human brain.A, RT-PCR analysis of brain variant CYP2D7 in 12 human brain autopsy samples (lanes 1–12). Brain variant CYP2D7 could be detected in 6 samples wherein a band of 340 bp was detected. The PCR-amplified product of 280 bp representing CYP2D6 was detected in all the 12 samples. M represents the DNA molecular mass markers. B, membrane preparations from the 12 human autopsy brain samples (lanes 1–12) were immunoblotted and stained with antiserum to brain variant CYP2D7. Brain variant CYP2D7 protein could be detected only in 6 brain samples, which also showed the expression of the transcript by RT-PCR. M represents protein molecular mass markers. C, electropherogram of PCR-amplified genomic DNA from 4 brain samples (represented in lanes 1–4 in A and B). In brain variants 1 and 2 CYP2D7 is not expressed, and the genomic sequence revealed the presence of the pseudogene CYP2D7, as represented by the sequence CCTTGC. In brain variants 3 and 4 CYP2D7 is expressed, and the genomic sequence CCTGC was seen.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We generated an antiserum to the 19-amino acid peptide representing 57 bp of intron 6 present in the brain variant CYP2D7. The peptide used to generate the antiserum did not share homology with any known P450 enzyme, and the antiserum did not cross-react with P4502D6. Expression of brain variant CYP2D7 protein as assessed by immunoblotting was seen in 6 of the 12 brain samples (see Fig. 3B) that were positive for the presence of brain variant CYP2D7 mRNA by RT-PCR (Fig. 3A), indicating the concordance between the RT-PCR and immunoblot results.Localization of Brain Variant CYP2D7 by in Situ Hybridization—The 340-bp RT-PCR amplicon generated as described above was ligated into the pCRII vector for riboprobe synthesis to localize the brain variant CYP2D7 in human tissues using in situ hybridization. Brain variant CYP2D7 mRNA was detected in cortical neurons in human brain but not in the liver or kidney of the same individual (Fig. 4, A, B, and C, respectively). However, CYP2D6 mRNA was detected in brain, liver, and kidney when in situ hybridization was performed using the cDNA to CYP2D6 (Fig. 4, D, E, and F, respectively).Fig. 4Localization of brain variant CYP2D7 and CYP2D6 in human tissue. The brain variant CYP2D7 transcript was localized in cortical neurons in human brain, but it was absent in liver and kidney sections from the same individual (A, B, and C, respectively). The transcript representing the full-length CYP2D6 gene was detectable in brain, liver, and kidney (D, E, and F, respectively).

The genomic DNA isolated from the 12 human brain samples used for RT-PCR and immunoblot experiments was used as the template. The region spanning 45–551 bp (506 bp) relative to the ATG start codon of the genomic sequence of CYP2D7 was amplified using PCR. The 138delT (CCTGC) was found only in those samples in which the mRNA and protein of the brain variant CYP2D7 were detected (Fig. 3C); others had complete sequence similarity with the pseudogene CYP2D7 (CCTTGC).Brain Variant CYP2D7 Metabolizes Codeine Predominantly to Morphine—Monooxygenase activity of brain variant CYP2D7 was ascertained by examining the metabolism of codeine to norcodeine and morphine. Membrane preparations containing both mitochondria and microsomes were prepared from Neuro2a cells transfected with the cDNA of brain variant CYP2D7 because P450-mediated xenobiotic metabolism takes place in both microsomes and mitochondria in rat and human brain (13Bhagwat S.V. Boyd M.R. Ravindranath V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 320: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 21Bhagwat S.V. Bhamre S. Boyd M.R. Ravindranath V. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 1469-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The expressed brain variant CYP2D7 metabolized 10 μm codeine to morphine alone, and norcodeine could not be detected (Fig. 5). In membranes from cells transfected with cDNA of liver CYP2D6, norcodeine was the major metabolite (62%) and morphine, the minor metabolite (38%; Fig. 5B). No metabolite of codeine was detected in cells transfected with vector alone or vector containing the cDNA in reverse orientation (data not shown). Typically, codeine is administered at doses ranging from 60 to 120 mg/day. The plasma concentration of codeine in humans after a single dose of 120 mg is about 474 μg/liter (1.1 μm); we therefore used 10 μm codeine as substrate concentration (22Kim I. Barnes A.J. Oyler J.M. Schepers R. Joseph R.E. Cone E.J. Lafko D. Moolchan E.T. Huestis M.A. Clin. Chem. 2002; 48: 1486-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). When the codeine concentration was increased to 200 μm, a small amount of norcodeine (11% of total metabolite) was formed. The Vmax/Km values for the metabolism of codeine to morphine and norcodeine by brain variant CYP2D7 were 13.5 and 0.6 nmol of product formed/min/nmol P450/mm substrate concentration, respectively. The corresponding values with CYP2D6 were 0.8 and 1.5 nmol of product formed/min/nmol of P450/mm substrate concentration, respectively. Metabolism of codeine to morphine could be inhibited by antiserum to P4502D6 and quinidine, a selective inhibitor of CYP2D (Fig. 5C), indicating that this biotransformation was indeed mediated by a P4502D enzyme.Fig. 5Metabolism of codeine by heterologously expressed brain variant CYP2D7 and CYP2D6.A, chromatogram depicting retention times of standard norcodeine and morphine (top panel). CYP2D6 metabolizes codeine to norcodeine and morphine (middle panel), whereas brain variant CYP2D7 metabolized codeine only to morphine (bottom panel). The codeine concentration was 10 μm.

https://openalex.org/W2089331280,"Synthetic peptides were used in this study to identify a structural element of apolipoprotein (apo) A-I that stimulates cellular cholesterol efflux and stabilizes the ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1). Peptides (22-mers) based on helices 1 (amino acids 44–65) and 10 (amino acids 220–241) of apoA-I had high lipid binding affinity but failed to mediate ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux, and they lacked the ability to stabilize ABCA1. The addition of helix 9 (amino acids 209–219) to either helix 1 (creates a 1/9 chimera) or 10 (9/10 peptide) endowed cholesterol efflux capability and ABCA1 stabilization activity similar to full-length apoA-I. Adding helix 9 to helix 1 or 10 had only a small effect on lipid binding affinity compared with the 22-mer peptides, indicating that helix length and/or determinants on the polar surface of the amphipathic α-helices is important for cholesterol efflux. Cholesterol efflux was specific for the structure created by the 1/9 and 9/10 helical combinations, as 33-mers composed of helices 1 and 3 (1/3), 2/9, and 4/9 failed to mediate cholesterol efflux in an ABCA1-dependent manner. Transposing helices 9 and 10 (10/9 peptide) did not change the class Y structure, hydrophobicity, or amphiphilicity of the helical combination, but the topography of negatively charged amino acids on the polar surface was altered, and the 10/9 peptide neither mediated ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux nor stabilized ABCA1 protein. These results suggest that a specific structural element possessing a linear array of acidic residues spanning two apoA-I amphipathic α-helices is required to mediate cholesterol efflux and stabilize ABCA1."

In eukaryotes hydratase 2 is a ∼31-kDa integral part of multifunctional enzyme type 2 (abbreviated MFE-2 in mammals and Mfe2p in fungi) (1Qin Y.-M. Poutanen M.H. Helander H.M. Kvist A.-P.

Chem. 1992; 267: 6646-6653Google Scholar). In mammals, hydratase 2 together with the 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase 1/isomer-ase part of multifunctional enzyme type I (MFE-1) (3Kiema T.-R. Engel C.K. Schmitz W. Filppula S.A. Wierenga R.K. Hiltunen J.K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2991-2999Google Scholar, 4Osumi T. Hashimoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 89: 580-584Google Scholar), are responsible for catalyzing the second reaction of the peroxisomal β-oxidation spiral. It has been shown by patient mutations as well as in vitro studies that hydratase 2 is a crucial enzyme in lipid metabolism of α-methyl-branched fatty acids (e.g. pristanic acid), bile acid intermediates, and very long-chain fatty acids (5Mo̊ller G. van Grunsven E.G. Wanders R.J. Adamski J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 171: 61-70Google Scholar, 6van Grunsven E.G. Mooijer P.A.W. Aubourg P. Wanders R.J.A. Hum. Mol.

J. 1997; 328: 377-382Google Scholar).Multiple sequence alignment of eukaryotic hydratase 2 has revealed a conserved region showing a motif, [YF]-X1,2-[LVIG][STGC]-GDXNP-[LIV]-HX5-[AS], called the hydratase 2 motif (9Qin Y.-M. Haapalainen A.M. Kilpelaäinen S.H. Marttila M.S. Koski M.K. Glumoff T. Novikov D.K. Hiltunen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4965-4972Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1C). The motif contains an aspartate residue (Asp-510 in human MFE-2), whose function as a catalytic residue has been suggested by site-directed mutagenesis studies (9Qin Y.-M. Haapalainen A.M. Kilpelaäinen S.H. Marttila M.S. Koski M.K. Glumoff T. Novikov D.K. Hiltunen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4965-4972Google Scholar). The closest prokaryotic homologs known that contain the hydratase 2 motif are from the polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA)producing bacteria, such as Aeromonas caviae (10Fukui T. Doi Y. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4821-4830Google Scholar), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11Tsuge T. Fukui T. Matsusaki H. Taguchi S. Kobayashi G. Ishizaki A. Doi Y. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 184: 193-198Google Scholar), Rhodospirillum caviae (12Reiser S.E. Mitsky T.A. Gruys K.J. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2000; 53: 209-218Google Scholar), and Methylobacterium rhodesianum (13Mothes G. Babel W. Can. J. Microbiol. 1995; 41: 68-72Google Scholar). These enzymes, referred to as (R)-specific 2-enoyl-CoA hydratases or (R)-hydratases, catalyze a similar hydration reaction as eukaryotic hydratase 2, but in prokaryotes the product, (3R)-hydroxyacyl-CoAs, are polymerized to PHA by PHA synthase (14Madison L.L. Huisman G.W. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 21-53Google Scholar). In general, the size of (R)-hydratases are around 15 kDa, and they show the highest catalytic efficiency with short-chain enoyl-CoAs (C4-C6). However, at least one (R)-hydratase makes an exception. A PhaJ2Pa gene product, PhaJ2Pa, characterized from P. aeruginosa has approximately the same subunit size as the eukaryotic hydratase 2 and shows a preference to enoyl-CoAs of C8-C12 (11Tsuge T. Fukui T. Matsusaki H. Taguchi S. Kobayashi G. Ishizaki A. Doi Y. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 184: 193-198Google Scholar).The crystal structure of A. caviae (R)-hydratase has been solved recently (15Hisano T. Tsuge T. Fukui T. Iwata T. Miki K. Doi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 617-624Google Scholar). The core structure is a hot dog fold, which is built up of a long and hydrophobic α-helix (“sausage”) packed against anti-parallel β-sheet (“bun”). In a functional dimer, two subunits associate side by side to form an extended 10-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet layer. A similar hot dog fold and subunit organization is also found in Escherichia coli β-hydroxydecanoyl thiol ester dehydrase (FabA; dehydrase) of fatty acid synthesis type II (16Leesong M. Henderson B.S. Gillig J.R. Schwab J.M. Smith J.L. Structure. 1996; 4: 253-264Google Scholar). The major difference between these two enzymes is the additional loop structure in (R)-hydratase, referred to as overhanging segment (15Hisano T. Tsuge T. Fukui T. Iwata T. Miki K. Doi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 617-624Google Scholar). Despite the FabA lacking the overhanging segment housing the conserved hydratase 2 motif, the proposed catalytic residues, Asp-84 and His-70′ of the neighboring subunit, are arranged identically with the proposed catalytic residues, Asp-31 and His-36 (from the same subunit), of (R)-hydratase proposing an equal enzyme mechanism in addition/elimination of water molecule to/from 2-enoyl/(3R)-hydroxyacyl thioesters. Incongruously, the catalytic dyad of human hydratase 2 is proposed to form by an aspartate (Asp-510) and a glutamate (Glu-366) residues (9Qin Y.-M. Haapalainen A.M. Kilpelaäinen S.H. Marttila M.S. Koski M.K. Glumoff T. Novikov D.K. Hiltunen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4965-4972Google Scholar). Interestingly, the suggested catalytic glutamate locates in the N-terminal half of eukaryotic protein, which is absent in the prokaryotic (R)-hydratase.Even though the prokaryotic (R)-hydratase from A. caviae and eukaryotic hydratase 2 are related enzymes, they have major differences concerning the size of the enzymes, acyl chain substrate specificities, as well as biological functions in the cell. In the present work we show for the first time the three-dimensional structures for an eukaryotic hydratase 2 (from Candida tropicalis MFE-2) as a free (apoenzyme) and enzyme-product complex (holoenzyme). The crystal structures locate the catalytic residues and suggest a novel catalytic mechanism for (R)-specific hydratases/dehydratases. Moreover, the structures introduce novel features for quaternary structure, evolution, substrate binding mode, and stereospecificity of hydratase 2 from the fatty acid β-oxidation pathway.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPrimary Phasing and Structure Refinement of SeMet-labeled CtMfe2p(dha+bΔ)—The recombinant and selenomethionine (SeMet)-labeled 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase 2 part (residues 628-906) of C. tropicalis Mfe2p (CtMfe2p(dha+bΔ)) was overexpressed, purified, and crystallized as described previously (17Koski M.K. Haapalainen A.M. Hiltunen J.K. Glumoff T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1302-1305Google Scholar). Primary phases for a SeMet-crystal were determined by the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion method using data measured at three wavelengths (17Koski M.K. Haapalainen A.M. Hiltunen J.K. Glumoff T.

Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Google Scholar), and initial selenium sites were searched for using the program SOLVE (19Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Google Scholar). The positions of eight selenium atoms were confirmed and further refined using CNS (20Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar), leading to two additional sites. The figure of merit at the beginning of the structure determination was 0.56, and the electron density calculated with the help of these 10 sites already revealed clear secondary structure elements. The initial maps were improved by solvent-flattening calculations using a water content of 56%, after which the maps were interpretable. The building of the initial model was performed manually using O (21Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowen S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar). Phases were extended to 1.95 Å using a combined data set, having the 100% data to 2.25 Å and the following 86% complete high resolution data to 1.95 Å. Before refinement cycles, the data were reprocessed and scaled using XDS (22Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Google Scholar). Structural refinement was initiated with the simulated annealing protocol in CNS followed by refinement cycles with REFMAC (23Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Google Scholar). The non-crystallo-graphic symmetry was not applied in the refinement. Water molecules were added by the solvent building mode of the program ARP/wARP (24Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Preparation of CtMfe2p(dha+bΔH813Q) Crystallization Sample, Cocrystallization with Its Ligand and Structure Determination—The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used for making the H813Q mutations in CtMfe2p(dha+bΔ). The oligonucleotide pairs used for mutagenesis were 5′-GACAGAAACCCATTGCAGATTGATCCAAACTTTGC-3′ and 5′-GCAAAGTTTGGATCAATCTGCAATGGGTTTCTGTC-3′ (the underlined letters show the nucleotide triplets resulting in the amino acid substitution, His-813 to Gln). The CtMfe2p(dha+bΔH813Q) was purified like the native protein (17Koski M.K. Haapalainen A.M. Hiltunen J.K. Glumoff T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1302-1305Google Scholar) and concentrated to 12 mg/ml, and the hydratase 2 activity of the mutated variant was measured with 60 μm trans-2-decenoyl-CoA as described (25Hiltunen J.K. Palosaari P.M. Kunau W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13536-13540Google Scholar). The initial crystallization conditions were searched using the hanging drop method and the Clear Strategy Screen I (26Brzozowski A.M. Walton J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 97-101Google Scholar) at 4 °C. Finally, in the presence of 22% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 2000 monomethyl ether, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.0, and 1.2 mm trans-2-decenoyl-CoA, several twinned needle-like crystals appeared. Crystals were separated, incubated 30 s in cryosolution (30% (v/v) ethylene glycol, 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 2000 monomethyl ether, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.0, 1.2 mm trans-2-decenoyl-CoA), and flash-frozen in a nitrogen stream to -170 °C. The crystals belonged to space group P21 with unit cell parameters of a = 48.64 Å, b = 151.29 Å, c = 81.62 Å, and β = 90.50°. A 96.4% complete dataset was collected at the synchrotron beamline X13 (DESY, Hamburg, Germany) to 2.35 Å. Data were processed and scaled with XDS, and the structure was solved with molecular replacement using CNS and the subunit D of SeMet CtMfe2p(dha+bΔ) as the model. At first, only three monomers (subunits A, B, and C) were found in the asymmetric unit of the CtMfe2p(dha+bΔH813Q) crystal, and after the first refinement cycle with REFMAC the Rwork and Rfree values were 38.5% and 42.8%, respectively. The missing regions in subunits A and B were built using O, and the disordered regions 678-697 and 729-732 were excluded from the subunit C. The last subunit, D, was added manually using the A-B pair of the same crystal form, by superimposing the subunit A on C. The following refinement with four subunits and 130 water molecules reduced the Rwork to 24.7% (Rfree = 29.2%). At this stage, the coordinates of octanoyl-CoA (27Engel C.K. Kiema T.-R. Hiltunen J.K. Wierenga R.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 847-859Google Scholar) were used to fit omit Fourier maps of subunits A, B, and D, and after refinement the Rwork dropped to 22.7% (Rfree = 27.1%). The coordinates of the ligand were completed by manually adding the two missing carbon atoms to the ω-end of the fatty acyl tail as well as the hydroxyl group to the β-carbon. The final refinement statistics as well as the data processing statistics are presented in Table I.The structures were validated with PROCHECK (28Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Google Scholar) and WHATIF (29Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Google Scholar). The secondary structures were analyzed by using PROMOTIF (30Hutchincon E.G. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 212-220Google Scholar), and the structure drawings were made with Swiss-PdbViewer (31Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Google Scholar). The figures illustrating the holoenzyme structure were drawn by using the subunit A (or A-B dimer in Fig. 1B) of CtMfe2p(dha+bΔH813Q) with the bound ligand, whereas subunit C of SeMet CtMfe2p(dha+bΔ) crystal structure was used for pictures presenting the active site of the apoenzyme.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe Structure Determination of CtMfe2p(dha+bΔ)—The complete multiwavelength anomalous dispersion data for the recombinant, SeMet-labeled CtMfe2p(dha+bΔ) were used for initial phase determination of apoenzyme of hydratase 2. The data from another crystal form obtained from the co-crystallization experiment of CtMfe2p(dha+bΔH813Q) in the presence of natural ligand, trans-2-decenoyl-CoA, were phased by a molecular replacement solution using the subunit D of the apoenzyme as a starting model. In both crystal forms, the asymmetric unit consists of two functional dimers and a continuous polypeptide chain in each subunit could be built starting at Asp-630 or Pro-631, with some variation between the subunits (Table I). The extreme C-terminal residues containing the peroxisomal targeting signal type 1 (32Gould S.J. Keller G.A. Hosken N. Wilkinson J. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1657-1664Google Scholar) are solvent-exposed and disordered in all subunits. The positive electron density in subunits A, B, and D of the CtMfe2p(dha+bΔH813Q) crystal defined acyl groups with a hydroxyl group in the (R)-position at the β-carbon (see Fig. 3C below) but not a planar double-bond at Cα-Cβ, revealing that the actual ligand in the holoenzyme was the hydrated product of trans-2-decenoyl-CoA, the (3R)hydroxydecanoyl-CoA (3RHDC). No density for the ligand was observed in subunit C of the holoenzyme. The presence of the mutation, H813Q, was confirmed by the electron density maps (Fig. 3C). The more detailed structural statistics of both crystal forms are summarized in Table I.Fig. 3The active site architecture of CtMfe2p(dha+bΔ). A, stereo view of the H-bonding network in the active site of apo form of CtMfe2p(dha+bΔ). The H-bond network is shown as black dashed lines. A black arrow shows the catalytic water molecule, which is H-bonded to the carboxylate oxygen of Asp-808, the Nϵ2 atom of His-813, and the Nϵ2 atom of Asn-810. The carbons, nitrogens, oxygens, and selenium have been colored in gray, blue, red, and brown, respectively, and the water molecules are colored in magenta. B, stereo view of the active site of CtMfe-2p(dha+bΔH813Q) complexed with 3R-HDC. Only the acyl part and β-mercaptoethyleneamine moiety of 3RHDC are shown. Water molecules W6, W7, and W8 give way to the substrate as it enters the binding site, whereas the first five waters remain in position. The black arrow shows the (3R)-hydroxyl group, which is added to the β-carbon of the acyl moiety, and the red arrow indicates the H-bond crucial for oxyanion hole formation. The (3R)-hydroxyl of the 3RHDC molecule is H-bonded to the carboxylate oxygen of Asp-808 as well as to the Nϵ2 atoms of Gln-813 and Asn-810. The point mutation, H813Q, does not affect the folding of the active site. The atom colors correspond to the coloring in panel A, in addition to two sulfur atoms, which are shown in yellow. c, the final 2Fo - Fc map around 3RHDC molecule at 2.35-Å resolution (contoured at 1.0 σ. The map is drawn also around the catalytic residue, Asp-808, as well as Gln813, which replaces the catalytically active His-813 in the mutant protein. A black arrow points to the electron density for the (3R)-hydroxyl group.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The Overall Structure of CtMfe2p(dha+bΔ)—The CtMfe2p-(dha+bΔ) subunit is composed of 5 well defined α-helices (α1 and α4-α7) and 11 β-strands (β1-β11), which form a compact molecule with dimensions of 35 × 40 × 45 Å (Figs. 1A and 2A). The subunit structure can be further divided into an N-terminal domain (or N-domain, residues 631-770), a C-terminal domain (or C-domain, residues 789-900), and an intervening bridge (residues 771-788), which connects the two domains and includes a short α-helix, α4 (Fig. 2A). The core structure of the C-domain of the CtMfe2p(dha+bΔ) consists of a 16-residue α-helix, α7, and covering β-strands, β7-β11, forming a typical hot dog fold first identified in FabA (16Leesong M. Henderson B.S. Gillig J.R. Schwab J.M. Smith J.L. Structure. 1996; 4: 253-264Google Scholar). Moreover, the C-domain of the CtMfe2p(dha+bΔ) contains a solvent-exposed loop structure (residues 806-830), included by an amphipathic α-helix, α6, and an α-helix, α5, which sandwiches the α7 with the β-sheet layer. The folding of the C-domain of CtMfe2p(dha+bΔ) is strikingly similar with the subunit of the A. caviae (R)-hydratase (the root mean square deviation = 1.54 for Cα atoms) as can be proposed by a 15% overall sequence identity. The solvent-exposed loop structure, mainly composed of residues belonging to the hydratase 2 motif and referred to as the overhanging segment in A. caviae (R)-hydratase, is a unique feature for (R)-specific 2-enoyl-CoA hydratases and distinguishes the C-domain of eukaryotic hydratase 2 and (R)-hydratase from the crystal structure of FabA (16Leesong M. Henderson B.S. Gillig J.R. Schwab J.M. Smith J.L. Structure. 1996; 4: 253-264Google Scholar). However, the similar overall fold indicates that all these enzymes/domains, utilizing trans-2-enoyl/(3R)-hydroxyacyl metabolites, most probably share a common ancestor.Fig. 2Structural comparison of functional units of eukaryotic and prokaryotic (R)-specific hydratases. A, ribbon representation of the two-domain subunit structure of 31.5-kDa CtMfe2p(dha+bΔ) in the presence of 3RHDC. The N- and C-domains are colored in red and violet, respectively. The intervening bridge is yellow, and the 3RHDC is shown as black sticks. The N-domain flexible regions corresponding to the loops I, II, and III are labeled and colored lighter red. The view is from the top of the molecule, and the second monomer in the dimer would be underneath. B, the homodimeric (R)-hydratase from A. caviae (Protein Data Bank accession code ID 1IQ6). The two 14-kDa subunits are colored red and violet, and the secondary structure elements are labeled according to Ref. 15Hisano T. Tsuge T. Fukui T. Iwata T. Miki K. Doi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 617-624Google Scholar. The overhanging segments are labeled as H2 motifs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Interestingly, the N-domain of CtMfe2p(dha+bΔ) resembles significantly the C-domain, although no clear sequence similarity can be found between the domains. If the N-domain is rotated 180° around the vertical axis perpendicular to the β-sheet layer, the β-strands, β1-β5, superimpose with the β-strands, β7-β11, of the C-domain, as do α1 and α5. Moreover the N-domain contains a solvent-exposed loop structure (residues 647-668) resembling the overhanging segment of the C-domain; although it lacks the well defined α-helix, a PRO-MOTIF analysis (30Hutchincon E.G. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 212-220Google Scholar) revealed α-helical structure (α1/2) also in this loop (Fig. 1C). The major difference between the two domains is, however, that the core helix, the “sausage” of the hot dog fold is replaced in the N-domain by a region consisting of short stretches of α-helices, α2 and α3, connected by a random coil structure (Figs. 1A and 2A). Therefore the features of the hot dog fold are only partially fulfilled in the N-domain of CtMfe2p(dha+bΔ).The N-domain is paired with the C-domain via β-strands β2 and β8 such that an extended 11-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet layer is formed in a CtMfe2p(dha+bΔ) subunit (Fig. 2A). This arrangement of the two domains in CtMfe2p(dha+bΔ) resembles strikingly the pairing of the two subunits of FabA and especially to that of A. caviae (R)-hydratase (Fig. 2). The origin of the N-domain of the CtMfe2p(dha+bΔ), which replaces the neighboring subunit when compared with prokaryotic homologs, is an intriguing question. Although the N- and C-domains of the CtMfe2p(dha+bΔ) share only <10% amino acid sequence identity, both domains show in addition to the similar folds a 50% identity at the level of DNA. This suggests that they have arisen via gene duplication rather than via gene fusion of two non-related genes with subsequent structural convergence.The dimer of CtMfe2p(dha+bΔ) is elongated, with dimensions of 70 × 40 × 45 Å, and the dimerization is accomplished by a four-helix bundle structure where the pairwise arranged α-helices, α1 from the N-domain and α5 form the C-domain, from one subunit are packed against their counterparts from the other one in an anti-parallel fashion (Fig. 1B). In addition to the major contacts via four-helix bundle, the N-domain solvent-exposed loop and the overhanging segment are participating in the dimeric interactions (Fig. 1B). One of the strengthening contacts formed between the subunits is the salt bridge Glu-659 to Arg-804′. Importantly, Glu-659 corresponds to the proposed catalytic Glu-366 in the human enzyme suggesting that the role of the N-domain glutamate is rather to stabilize the folding of the hydratase 2 motif and to strengthen the dimeric interactions than to participate directly in the catalytic reaction. Despite the resemblance of the subunit structure of CtMfe2p(dha+bΔ) with the homodimeric bacterial counterparts, the dimerization of the two subunits of CtMfe2p(dha+bΔ) makes the quaternary fold of the eukaryotic hydratase 2 a novel feature.Substrate Binding Mode—The bound 3RHDC molecule locates between β-strands β2 and β8 of the extended β-sheet at the interface of the N- and the C-domains (Figs. 1A and 2A). The CoA molecule is in a bent conformation, a state often found in the CoA molecules bound to proteins (33Engel C. Wierenga R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 790-797Google Scholar). The tunnel formed in the domain interface engulfs part of 3RHDC but not the 3′-phosphate ADP and half of the pantetheine moiety. The adenine ring of the bound substrate lies in a pocket surrounded by the side chains of Arg-855 and Phe-758. The adenine amino group is hydrogen-bonded (H-bonded) to the backbone oxygen of Phe-856, and the 3′-phosphate group of the ribose is solvent-exposed and has a stabilizing salt bridge to the side chain of Lys-729. Noteworthy, all these residues interacting with the CoA moiety are highly conserved among the eukaryotic hydratase 2 proteins and in PhaJ2Pa (Fig. 1C).The remaining ten-carbon acyl chain of the substrate is buried in the hydrophobic cleft formed by the N-terminal β-strands β2 and β5 and by the N-terminal loop structure (residues 678-697). The loop contains hydrophobic resi"
https://openalex.org/W2139985114,"The sequential processing of the familial disease gene product amyloid β precursor protein (AβPP) by β- and γ-secretases generates amyloid β, which is considered to be the pathogenic factor of Alzheimer's disease, and the AID peptide (AβPP intracellular domain). The AID peptide acts as a positive regulator of apoptosis and modulates transcription and calcium release. To gain clues about the molecular mechanisms regulating the function of AβPP and AID, proteins interacting with the AID region of AβPP have been isolated using the yeast two-hybrid system. Recent evidence indicates that AβPP undergoes post-translational modification events in the AID region and that phosphorylation might regulate its affinity for interacting proteins. To test this possibility and to uncover AβPP-binding partners whose interaction depends on AβPP phosphorylation, we used a proteomic approach. Here we describe a protein, growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2), that specifically binds AβPP, phosphorylated in Tyr682. Furthermore, we show that this interaction is direct and that Grb2 binds to phospho-AβPP via its Src homology 2 region. Together with the evidence that Grb2 is in complex with AβPP in human brains and that these complexes are augmented in brains from Alzheimer's cases, our data indicate that Grb2 may mediate some biological and possibly pathological AβPP-AID function.

AD is genetically linked to a few molecules, one of which is the amyloid β precursor protein (AβPP), a type I transmembrane protein that undergoes processing by the secretases to produce various fragments. Processing by the β- and γ-secretases generates the Aβ fragment from the β to the γ sites and AβPP intracellular domain (AID) from the γ site to the C terminus (2Sisodia S.S. St George-Hyslop P.H.

The pathologic cascade, which leads to clinical manifestations of AD, has not been fully characterized although the “amyloid hypothesis” has been used to explain certain aspects of AD pathology. According to this hypothesis, the accumulation of Aβ is the primary event that leads to all subsequent events in the pathology of AD (8Hardy J. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 297: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (10782) Google Scholar).However, considering that Aβ and AID production is dependent on the γ-secretase, several groups have attempted to understand the biological effects of AID production. Indeed, it has been found that AID is able to trigger apoptosis or lower the threshold of the cell to other apoptotic stimuli (9Passer B. Pellegrini L. Russo C. Siegel R.M. Lenardo M.J. Schettini G.

To gain information about the mechanisms by which AID regulates these biological processes, the yeast two-hybrid screen has been used to identify proteins interacting with the cytoplasmic tail of AβPP. Using this method, several AβPP interactors have been identified.

The PTB domain of these proteins interacts in a phosphorylation-independent manner with the YENPTY sequence present in the intracellular domain of AβPP.Recent data have shown that the cytoplasmic tail of AβPP undergoes post-translational modification events such as Thr and Tyr phosphorylation (31da Cruz e Silva E.F. da Cruz e Silva O.A.

These phosphorylation events are detected in the brain of normal subjects as well as in patients with Alzheimer's disease. We have found that phosphorylation of Tyr682 affects the interaction of AβPP with some binding partners. ShcA and -C, members of a family of cytoplasmic adaptor proteins that also includes ShcB, contain a PTB region that binds to the YENPTY AβPP motif (42Tarr P.E. Roncarati R. Pelicci G. Pelicci P.G. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16798-16804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, unlike the other PTB-containing proteins that interact with AβPP, ShcA and -C associate with AβPP only when Tyr682 is phosphorylated. Interestingly, the expression level of ShcA protein is augmented in AD brains as compared with normal brain samples (43Russo C. Dolcini V. Salis S. Venezia V. Violani E. Carlo P. Zambrano N. Russo T. Schettini G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 973: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 44Russo C. Dolcini V. Salis S. Venezia V. Zambrano N. Russo T. Schettini G. J. Biol.

Moreover, Shc-AβPP complexes are found in human brains and are increased in AD samples.These data underscore the biological relevance of AβPP phosphorylation. Moreover, they suggest that these phosphorylation events may control AβPP functions by regulating the affinity of AβPP for distinct binding partners. Because the yeast two-hybrid system is not ideal to identify interactions that are regulated by post-translational modification events, we used a biochemical approach to isolate brain proteins in which the binding to AβPP is modulated by AβPP phosphorylation. In this study, we describe one of the interactors isolated using this strategy, growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2). We present data showing that Grb2 directly interacts with AβPP and that this interaction requires phosphorylation of Tyr682 in AβPP. Unlike the other interactors that bind the YENPTY AβPP motif via their PTB domain, Grb2 binds to YpENPTY via its Src homology (SH) 2 region. These data, together with the finding that a complex of Grb2-AβPP is formed in human brains and that these complexes are increased in AD brains, suggest that Grb2 may mediate some biological and perhaps pathological AβPP-AID function.MATERIALS AND METHODSStrep-tag Peptides Synthesis—Strep-tag peptides including the strep-tag alone (control), strep-tag AID, strep-tag AID phosphothreonine (AID-Thr(P)668), strep-tag AID phosphotyrosine (AID-Tyr(P)682), and strep-tag AID phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine (AID-Thr(P)668/Tyr(P)682) were synthesized and purified by Tufts University Core Facility (Boston, MA). The sequences of the peptides used are indicated in Fig. 1A.cDNA Constructs—The GST-Grb2 full-length (fl) and GST-Grb2 N- and C-terminal SH3 constructs were generously provided by Dr. Robert A. Weinberg. The GST-Grb2-SH2 construct was prepared by PCR amplification of the SH2 domain. The PCR primers used for the cloning (restriction sites are indicated in boldface) are the following: SH2 sense, 5′-AAAAGGATCCGCCATGTGGTTT-3′; SH2 antisense, 5′-AAA-ACTCGAGTTATTCTATGTC-3′. The amplified product was cloned into pGEX vector (Amersham Biosciences) and sequenced. The GST-AID constructs have been described previously (42Tarr P.E. Roncarati R. Pelicci G. Pelicci P.G. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16798-16804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). All of the YFP-Grb2 constructs were prepared by PCR amplification, cloned into YFP-N1 vector (Clontech), and sequenced.Cell Culture—Stock cultures of wild type and ShcA knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells (a gift from Dr. G. Pelicci) and human embryonic kidney 293 cells stably transfected with AβPP695 were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Biofluids, Rockville, MD) and penicillin/streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere containing 7% (v/v) CO2 at 37 °C.GST Fusion Proteins—Recombinant GST fusion proteins were constructed as described above and expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (Invitrogen) to make non-phosphorylated proteins and were expressed in strain TKB1 (Stratagene) to make tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (42Tarr P.E. Roncarati R. Pelicci G. Pelicci P.G. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16798-16804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Phosphorylation of fusion proteins was confirmed by immunoblotting.Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal Grb2 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and mouse monoclonal ShcA antibody was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Phosphotyrosine-100 mouse monoclonal antibody was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), and mouse monoclonal P2-1 antibody was a generous gift of W. E. Van Nostrand (45Van Nostrand W.E. Wagner S.L. Shankle W.R. Farrow J.S. Dick M. Rozemuller J.M. Kuiper M.A. Wolters E.C. Zimmerman J. Cotman C.W. Cunningham D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2551-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). 22C11 monoclonal antibody was purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA), and horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Southern Biotechnology Associates (Birmingham, AL).GST Pulldowns, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot Analysis— For GST pull-down experiments, cells were collected, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 70 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, pH 7.5) to which was added 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (42Tarr P.E. Roncarati R. Pelicci G. Pelicci P.G. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16798-16804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). 6 μg of each GST fusion protein was incubated with cell lysates for 2 h. Samples were washed four times with lysis buffer and then boiled with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For immunoprecipitation experiments cells were collected 48 h after transfection, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed with lysis buffer. After 30 min of precleaning with ImmunoPure Plus immobilized protein AG (Pierce), cell lysates were incubated overnight with the antibodies and then processed as described previously. The eluted proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with the primary antibodies for 1 h or overnight. Immunoblots were revealed using horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies followed by chemiluminescence (Supersignal West Pico, Pierce).In Vitro Protein Interaction Assays—Equivalent molar amounts (3 nmol) of strep-tag AID peptides were incubated with 30 μl of 50% Strep-Tactin matrix (IBA) in a total volume of 400 μl of NET-N buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris/HCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, pH 8.0) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed two times with 400 μl of NET-N buffer and then incubated with 6 μg of each GST fusion protein in 400 μl of NET-N buffer for 2–4 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed with 1 ml of NET-N four times. The bound proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling the samples at 95 °C in SDS-PAGE loading buffer for 4 min. Proteins were analyzed by NuPAGE® Novex Bis-Tris 4–12% gel (Invitrogen) electrophoresis, and then each gel was stained with Coomassie Blue.Strep Pulldown from Mice Brain and MEF Cells—The strep pull-down experiment from MEFs was performed as the GST pull-down procedure described above, except that 3 nmol of strep-tag peptide were used instead of 6 μg of GST proteins. To prepare the mice brain lysates, adult BALB/c mice (age 3 months) were euthanized, and brains were removed and homogenized in buffer containing 100 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, protease and phosphatase inhibitors. To preclean the lysate, it was passed through the column containing strep-tag beads, and then equal amounts of precleaned lysate were applied onto each column containing Strep-Tactin matrix incubated previously with the different strep-tag peptides. The beads were washed four times with lysis buffer and then eluted with 10 mm desthiobiotin. The pulled samples were analyzed in parallel by SDS-PAGE followed by ammoniacal silver staining or Western blotting.Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Protein bands from SDS-PAGE were excised from the gel, triturated, and washed with water. Samples were reduced in gel, S-alkylated, and digested with trypsin as reported previously (46Talamo F. D'Ambrosio C. Arena S. Del Vecchio P. Ledda L. Zehender G. Ferrara L. Scaloni A. Proteomics. 2003; 3: 440-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Digests were subjected to a desalting/concentration step on μZipTipC18 (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) before mass analysis. Peptide mixtures were loaded on the MALDI target together with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as matrix using the dried droplet technique. Samples were analyzed with a Voyager-DE PRO mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA) (47Gianni D. Zambrano N. Bimonte M. Minopoli G. Mercken L. Talamo F. Scaloni A. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9290-9297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar); spectra were acquired in reflectron mode and elaborated using the Data Explorer 4.1 software provided by the manufacturer. Internal mass calibration was performed with peptides derived from enzyme autoproteolysis. The PROWL software package was used to identify bands unambiguously from independent Swiss Protein and NCBI non-redundant sequence data bases.Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—The human amyloid β-(1–40) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit was purchased from Immuno-Biological Laboratories (Fujioka, Japan). 48 h after transient transfection of YFP and YFP-Grb2 fusion proteins, Aβ-(1–40) was assayed in triplicates from conditioned media of HEK 293 stably transfected with AβPP695. The assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.RESULTSIdentification of Growth Factor Receptor-bound Protein 2 as Binding Protein of Phosphorylated AβPP Tyrosine—With the goal of identifying new AβPP interacting proteins in which binding is regulated by phosphorylation events, a direct AID-proteomic approach was used. Five synthetic peptides, i.e. control peptide, AID, AID phosphothreonine (AID-Thr(P)668), AID phosphotyrosine (AID-Tyr(P)682), and AID phosphothreonine and tyrosine (AID-Thr(P)668/Tyr(P)682) were immobilized on different samples of Strep-Tactin resin (Fig. 1A). A mouse brain cell lysate was applied in parallel on separate columns packed with these differently coated solid supports, was washed, and then was eluted by SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Before binding experiments, lysate was passed twice on resin to remove aspecific ligands. The pulled samples were analyzed in parallel by SDS-PAGE and stained by ammoniacal silver (Fig. 1B). Several bands were detected that did not occur in control, thus demonstrating the suitability of this methodology to isolate AβPP AID interacting proteins. A species migrating with an apparent mass of ∼28 kDa seemed to occur depending on the nature of coated support. In fact, this protein specifically interacted with AID-Tyr(P)682 and AID-Thr(P)668/Tyr(P)682 but not with control, AID, and AID-Thr(P)668 peptides, indicating that this binding to AID requires specific AID phosphorylation on Tyr682. Different bands were excised from the gel, treated, and digested as described under “Materials and Methods” and analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS. Peptide mass fingerprint experiments and non-redundant sequence data base searching identified the 28-kDa protein as Grb2 (Fig. 1C). These findings were confirmed by analyzing the same samples by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using an anti-Grb2 antibody (WB: αGrb2) (Fig. 1D). The αGrb2 antibody detected a component migrating at 28 kDa only in the samples eluted from the columns coated with AID-Tyr(P)682 and AID-Thr(P)668/Tyr(P)682 peptide and not with control, AID, and AID-Thr(P)668 peptides.The Grb2-AβPP Interaction Is Not Mediated by ShcA—Grb2 is an adaptor protein containing an SH2 domain flanked on both sides by an Src homology domain 3 (SH3) called SH3 N and C termini. The SH2 region of Grb2 interacts with phosphorylated tyrosine residues present in several proteins. Well described Grb2 interactors are tyrosine kinase receptors (RTKs) (48Lowenstein E.J. Daly R.J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 8038-8046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Upon activation by specific ligands, RTKs undergo tyrosine autophosphorylation. These phosphotyrosines function as docking sites for the SH2 domain of Grb2 and other cytoplasmic adaptors, which include Shc. Receptor-bound Shc proteins can also be phosphorylated by active RTKs and function as docking sites for an indirect recruitment of Grb2 to RTKs. Therefore, Grb2 can bind RTKs either directly or indirectly through Shc. In view of the finding that Shc family members directly bind to tyrosine-phosphorylated AβPP, we first tested whether ShcA proteins bridge Grb2 to AβPP-Tyr(P)682. To this end, we used ShcA knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts (kindly provided by G. Pelicci). Protein lysates from ShcA knock-out cells, as well as from wild type MEFs used as a control, were purified by affinity chromatography with control, AID, and AID-Tyr(P)682synthetic peptides, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Pulled samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using either an anti-ShcA (αShcA) or an anti-Grb2 antibody. The lower part of the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue to verify that the same amount of peptides was used for each pulldown (Fig. 2A, lower panel). The three ShcA isoforms of 46, 52, and 66 kDa were identified in the total lysate of wild type but not ShcA knock-out MEFs (lane I). As shown in the top panel of Fig. 2A, the 52- and 46-kDa ShcA isoforms interacted with AID-Tyr(P)682 but not with control and AID peptides. Grb2 protein, which is highly expressed in both wild type and ShcA knock-out MEFs, also interacted specifically with AID-Tyr(P)682 peptide (Fig. 2A, WB αGrb2). Interestingly, AID-Tyr(P)682 was still able to recruit Grb2 from ShcA knock-out MEFs, suggesting that ShcA is not required for the formation of the Grb2-AID-Tyr(P)682 complex.Fig. 2Pull-down experiments from ShcA WT and knock-out MEFs. A, the same amount of total protein was precipitated from ShcA WT and knock-out (KO) MEFs using control, AID, and AID-Tyr(P)682 synthetic peptides. The samples were then analyzed by WB and revealed by αShcA (top panel) and αGrb2 (middle panel) antibodies. All ShcA isoforms, 46-, 52-, and 66-kDa, are detected in the ShcA WT total lysates only (I.). The p52 and p46 ShcA isoforms interact specifically with AID-Tyr(P)682 and not with control or AID peptides. The αGrb2 WB reveals that AID-Tyr(P)682 peptide precipitates Grb2 protein in both ShcA WT and knock-out cells suggesting that ShcA is not necessary for the formation of Grb2-AID-Tyr(P)682 complex. The Coomassie Blue staining in the lower panel shows the amount of peptides used for each pulldown. B, total lysate from ShcA WT and knock-out cells was pulled down using GST-AID and GST-AID-Tyr(P)682 proteins. The WB with the αTyr(P) antibody verifies the phosphorylation state of the GST-AID-Tyr(P)682 proteins (bottom panel). The αShcA WB reveals that all ShcA isoforms are precipitated specifically by GST-AID-Tyr(P)682 and not by GST-AID proteins (top panel). In accord with the strep-tag pull-down experiment Grb2 interaction with GST-AID-Tyr(P)682 proteins does not require ShcA as shown by the αGrb2 WB (second panel). The apparent size differences in the bands detected by the αShcA and αGrb2 antibodies are caused by the gel distortion during the electrophoresis. In t"

The presence of glucose (a preferred carbon source) in liquid and solid glucose minimal salts (GMS) growth media strongly stimulated aflatoxin accumulation. Peptone (a non-preferred carbon source) in peptone minimal salts (PMS) media stimulated only low levels of aflatoxin accumulation. Glucose stimulated transcription of the aflatoxin structural genes ver-1 and nor-1 to similar intermediate levels in liquid GMS, while on solid media, ver-1 transcription was stimulated to 20-fold higher levels than nor-1. PMS liquid and solid media stimulated very low or non-detectable levels of transcription of both genes. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis using a nor-1 promoter fragment (norR) and A. parasiticus cell protein extracts revealed specific DNA-protein complexes of different mobility on GMS and PMS solid and liquid media. An imperfect cAMP-response element, CRE1, was identified in norR that mediated formation of the specific DNA-protein complexes. Mutation in CRE1 or AflR1 (AflR cis-acting site) caused up to a 3-fold decrease in cAMP-mediated stimulation of nor-1 promoter activity on GMS agar. South-Western blot analysis identified a 32-kDa protein that specifically bound to norR. p32 could be co-immunoprecipitated by anti-AflR antibody and co-purified with an AflR-maltose-binding protein fusion demonstrating a physical interaction between AflR and p32 in vitro.

Aflatoxins are secondary metabolites produced by Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus nomius, and Aspergillus parasiticus on food and feed crops (1Cotty P.J. Powell K.A. Fenwick A. Peberdy J.F. The Genus Aspergillus. Plenum Press, New York1994: 1-27Google Scholar). Aflatoxins have a broad range of toxic effects on humans and animals including carcinogenicity, neurotoxicity, and reproductive and developmental toxicity (for a review, see Ref. 2Council for Agricultural Science and TechnologyMycotoxins: Risks in Plant, Animal and Human Systems, Bulletin No. 139.

Therefore, aflatoxin contamination raises serious concerns related to environmental safety, food quality, and human and animal health. Aflatoxin biosynthesis is a complex process involving up to 20 enzyme-catalyzed reactions (3Brown M.P. Brown-Jenco C.S. Payne G.A. Fungal Genet.

Microbiol. 1995; 61: 2365-2371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The early aflatoxin pathway intermediate, norsolorinic acid, is converted to averantin by Nor-1, a norsolorinic acid reductase (7Zhou R.

Microbiol. 1994; 60: 4078-4085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ver-1 participates together with other enzyme activities in converting the middle aflatoxin pathway intermediate, versicolorin A, to demethylsterigmatocystin (9Skory C.D. Chang P.K. Cary J. Linz J.E.

We have studied nor-1 and ver-1 as model aflatoxin genes to understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate aflatoxin synthesis (8Trail F. Chang P.K. Cary J. Linz J.E. Appl. Environ.

Internal cAMP levels play an important role in induction of aflatoxin gene expression (14Roze L. Keller N. Beaudry R. Linz J.E. Mycopathologia. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 16Tice G. Buchanan R.L. J. Food Sci. 1981; 47: 153-157Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that cAMP at physiological concentrations negatively regulated aflatoxin accumulation through activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity. However, addition of high levels of exogenous cAMP (5 mm) caused strong down-regulation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity and resulted in up to a 10-fold increase in aflatoxin accumulation that correlated with up-regulation of nor-1 and ver-1 transcription (14Roze L. Keller N. Beaudry R. Linz J.E. Mycopathologia. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). We subsequently observed that wortmannin treatment increases intracellular cAMP, inhibits aflatoxin accumulation, and decreases nor-1 and ver-1 promoter activity; wortmannin presumably blocks phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase that in turn prevents activation of phosphodiesterase. 2J.-W. Lee, L. V. Roze, and J. E. Linz, manuscript in preparation. Aflatoxin accumulation is regulated by a number of environmental and nutritional factors and a variety of volatile natural plant compounds (4Cary J. Linz J. Bhantnagar D. Cary J. Bhantnagar D. Linz J. Microbial Foodborne Disease: Mechanisms of Pathogenesis and Toxin Synthesis. Technomic Publishing, Lancaster, PA2000: 317-362Google Scholar) including ethylene (15Roze L. Calvo-Byrd A.

In fungi, glucose normally inhibits expression of specific fungal genes via carbon catabolite repression (for a review, see Ref. 18Ruijter G.J. Visser J. FEMS Microbiol.

However, glucose stimulates aflatoxin synthesis (25Buchanan R.L. Lewis D.F. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1984; 48: 306-310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Buchanan R.L. Jones S.B. Gerasimowicz W.V.

Microbiol. 1987; 33: 828-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) demonstrated that cAMP levels are highest during active growth when glucose levels are high; glucose and cAMP then decline prior to induction of aflatoxin gene expression. Stimulation of aflatoxin biosynthesis by glucose may in part be explained by increased levels of AflR, a positive acting transcription factor (28Payne G.A. Nystrom G.J. Bhatnagar D. Cleveland T.E. Woloshuk C.P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 156-162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Liu B.H. Chu F.S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 3718-3723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AflR binds specifically to consensus AflR binding sites in several aflatoxin promoters, and this interaction is necessary for maximal gene expression (30Cary J.W. Ehrlich K.C. Wright M. Chang P.K.

Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI2003Google Scholar) suggesting that glucose influences aflatoxin synthesis indirectly. Data generated in our laboratory showed that regulation of nor-1 via AflR was not the entire story (33Miller M. Transcriptional Regulation of the Aspergillus parasiticus Aflatoxin Biosynthetic Pathway Gene nor-1. Ph.D. thesis. Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI2003Google Scholar). The nor-1 promoter carries a single AflR binding site (AflR1) that was necessary for maximal expression of nor-1 in a glucose minimal salts (GMS) 3The abbreviations used are: GMS, glucose minimal salts; PMS, peptone minimal salts; NMS, nitrate minimal salts; CRE, cAMP-response element; CREB, CRE-binding protein; MBP, maltose-binding protein; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GUS, β-d-glucuronidase; YES, yeast extract sucrose medium; DcAMP, N6,2′-O-dibutyryladenosine 3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate; I4, Isolate 4; ATF, activating transcription factor; CREM-1, CRE modulator protein-1; IP, immunoprecipitation; CRE1bp, CRE1-binding protein; ORF, open reading frame. liquid medium (33Miller M. Transcriptional Regulation of the Aspergillus parasiticus Aflatoxin Biosynthetic Pathway Gene nor-1. Ph.D. thesis. Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI2003Google Scholar). However, neither recombinant AflR nor protein extracts of A. parasiticus grown in a GMS liquid medium formed specific complexes in vitro using nor-1 promoter fragments carrying AflR1. These data suggested that AflR requires additional protein(s) to assist in binding to AflR1. Miller1 performed a detailed deletion analysis of the nor-1 promoter region and identified several conserved cis-acting sites including a functional TATA box, AflR binding site (AflR1), and a novel cis-acting site called NorL that was also necessary for maximum nor-1 transcriptional activity.1 These analyses also suggested that at least one additional unknown transcriptional regulator bound to the nor-1 promoter at a site located between -117 and +55. The objective of the current study was to identify this cis-acting site(s) in the nor-1 promoter and initiate analysis of its function. Using nor-1 promoter fragments in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs, in vitro) and functional mutation analysis (in vivo), we identified the location of a novel cis-acting cAMP-response element, CRE1; tentatively identified one protein or protein complex (CRE1bp) that specifically binds this site; and showed that CRE1, at least in part, is required for the cAMP-stimulated (exogenously supplied) up-regulation of nor-1 transcription. South-Western blot analysis identified a protein, p32, that bound specifically to norR. Based on observed in vitro interaction between p32 and AflR, we hypothesize that p32 assists AflR in binding to AflR1 in the nor-1 promoter. Strains, Growth Media, and Growth Conditions—Escherichia coli DH5α F′e [F′/endA1 hsdR17 (rk- mk-) supE44 thi-1 recA1 gyrA (Nalr)) relA1 (lacZYA argF) u169:(m80)lacZ M15) (Invitrogen) was used to amplify plasmid DNA using standard procedures (34Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York2003Google Scholar). A. parasiticus SU-1 (ATCC 56775) is a wild type aflatoxin producer and was the parent for all isogenic strains used in this study. NR-1, a spontaneous mutant (niaD) derived from SU-1 (35Liang S.H. Skory C.D. Linz J.E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 4568-4575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was transformed with plasmid pAPGUSNNB to generate strain D8D3 that contains a nor-1 promoter-GUS reporter fusion (uidA; encodes β-d-glucuronidase) integrated into the nor-1 locus (12Chiou C.H. Miller M. Wilson D.L. Trail F. Linz J.E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 306-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The presence of pAPGUSNNB at the 3′ end of nor-1 in the A. parasiticus SU-1 genome did not affect aflatoxin accumulation, conidiation levels, or nor-1 expression (transcript or protein accumulation) during growth on YES liquid medium (14Roze L. Keller N. Beaudry R. Linz J.E. Mycopathologia. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In preliminary studies (data not shown) we demonstrated that SU-1 and D8D3 have similar growth rates and similar levels of conidiation and aflatoxin accumulation on the GMS agar medium used in this study. Growth rate, aflatoxin synthesis, and conidiation in SU-1 and D8D3 were shown to respond similarly to treatment with exogenous DcAMP or cAMP (14Roze L. Keller N. Beaudry R. Linz J.E. Mycopathologia. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). A. parasiticus Isolate 4 (I4) contains the ver-1-GUS translational fusion integrated into the 3′ region of ver-1 (10Liang S.H. Wu T.S. Lee R. Chu F.S. Linz J.E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 1058-1065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another A. parasiticus SU-1-derived strain used was strain B62 (niaD nor-1 br-1; a norsolorinic acid-accumulating strain) derived from ATCC 24690 (nor-1 br-1) (36Chang P.K. Skory C.D. Linz J.E. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 231-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Strain TJYP1-22 was derived from B62 by transformation with fadAG42R, a dominant activating allele from Aspergillus nidulans (37Hicks J.K. Yu J.H. Keller N.P. Adams T.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4916-4923Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). TJYP1-22 has a fluffy autolytic phenotype, does not produce conidiospores, and does not produce detectable norsolorinic acid. AFS10 (ΔaflR) (a gift from Dr. J. Cary) resulted from inactivation of the aflatoxin cluster copy of aflR in A. parasiticus NR-1 via gene replacement by transformation with a vector containing aflR disrupted by niaD (38Cary J.W. Dyer J.M. Ehrlich K.C. Wright M.S. Liang S.H. Linz J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1576: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). AFS10 produces no aflatoxin or detectable transcripts from the aflatoxin structural genes nor-1, ver-1, or omtA. Chemically defined GMS and peptone minimal salts (PMS) media were prepared as described by Buchanan (16Tice G. Buchanan R.L. J. Food Sci. 1981; 47: 153-157Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar) except for the modifications described in Table I. For growth in liquid culture, 100 ml of medium in a 250-ml flask with five 6-mm glass beads were inoculated with 2 × 106 spores and incubated at 29 °C in the dark with shaking at 150 rpm.Table IComponents of liquid media used in this studyMediumaBase medium was the same for all as described previously (16)Carbon sourceNitrogen sourceZinc concentrationPMSPeptoneAmmonium (+peptone)10 μmNMSGlucoseNitrate10 μmGMSGlucoseAmmonium10 μma Base medium was the same for all as described previously (16Tice G. Buchanan R.L. J. Food Sci. 1981; 47: 153-157Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar) Open table in a new tab GMS agar medium supplemented with 5 μm Zn2+ was used as the base growth medium (16Tice G. Buchanan R.L. J. Food Sci. 1981; 47: 153-157Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar) for experiments conducted on solid culture. 104 conidiospores (in 30 μlofH2O) of D8D3 or I4 were center inoculated onto GMS agar plates (60 × 15 mm) in the presence or absence of 5 mm cAMP or 5 mm DcAMP and grown at 29 °C in the dark. Colonies on GMS did not grow to the edges of dish in the duration (6–7 days) of the experiments. GUS Activity Assays—Liquid culture GUS activity assays were performed with 1 mg of fresh protein extract as described by Miller (33Miller M. Transcriptional Regulation of the Aspergillus parasiticus Aflatoxin Biosynthetic Pathway Gene nor-1. Ph.D. thesis. Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI2003Google Scholar). Solid culture GUS activity assays were performed essentially as described in Roze et al. (14Roze L. Keller N. Beaudry R. Linz J.E. Mycopathologia. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). RNA and Protein Extraction for Northern and Western Blot Analyses—Liquid cultures of A. parasiticus D8D3 and I4 were filtered at the indicated time points through miracloth (Calbiochem). The mycelia were then frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. For RNA extraction, ∼200 mg of frozen mycelia were macerated with a mortar and pestle. TRIzol (Invitrogen) was used to extract total RNA from the ground mycelia following the manufacturer's instructions. For protein extraction, ∼200 mg of frozen mycelia were macerated with a mortar and pestle. The ground mycelia were suspended in 0.5 ml of GUS lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0), vortexed for 15 s, and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g at room temperature. Northern Hybridization Analysis—Northern analysis was performed as described in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (34Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York2003Google Scholar); total RNA (15 μg) was loaded and resolved by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel with 0.4 m formaldehyde. RNA was transferred by capillary action to a Nytran nylon membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) and immobilized by UV cross-linking in a Stratalinker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). nor-1 and ver-1 DNA probes were generated by PCR using plasmid pQE31 carrying the nor-1 cDNA (7Zhou R. Linz J.E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 5639-5641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the cosmid norA (39Trail F. Mahanti N. Rarick M. Mehigh R. Liang S.H. Zhou R. Linz J.E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 2665-2673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. The primer pairs for each reaction were: nor-1, 5′-GCGACACGAACCCAG-3′ and 3′-CGTCCCAAAACGACC-5′; ver-1, 5′-AGCGCGGAGCCAAAG-3′ and 3′-CGGGCGACATCCACAG-5′. The PCR products were gel-purified using the QiaexII gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA). Approximately 120 ng of each DNA fragment were radiolabeled by the random priming method (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) using 50 μCi of [32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The probes were hybridized to the immobilized RNA for 16 h at 65 °C. The membranes were washed twice at room temperature for 15 min under low stringency (2× SSC, 0.1% SDS) followed by a high stringency wash at 65 °C (0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS). Signals were detected using an FX phosphorimaging system (Bio-Rad). Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analyses were performed by standard procedures (34Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York2003Google Scholar). 30 μg of total protein were resolved by electrophoresis through a 12% acrylamide gel using a Miniprotean II electrophoresis cell (Bio-Rad). The proteins were electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) and probed with anti-Nor-1 (this study) or anti-Ver-1 (10Liang S.H. Wu T.S. Lee R. Chu F.S. Linz J.E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 1058-1065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as primary antibody. Alkaline phosphatase-labeled rabbit anti-IgG (Sigma) was used as a secondary antibody. Colorimetric detection of the enzyme-linked secondary antibody was carried out using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium tablets (Amresco, Solon, OH). Duplicate gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 to evaluate the composition and condition of the protein extracts and to verify equal loading. nor-1 and ver-1 Promoter Fragments—The 5′ boundary of the ver-1 promoter region (used in ver-1-GUS reported constructs) was delineated by the poly(A) site of the norA gene immediately upstream. The 3′ boundary was delineated 25 base pairs downstream of the translational start site. Similarly the 5′ boundary of the nor-1 promoter region (used in nor-1-GUS reporter constructs and EMSA) was delineated by the poly(A) site of the gene immediately upstream, ORF3 (33Miller M. Transcriptional Regulation of the Aspergillus parasiticus Aflatoxin Biosynthetic Pathway Gene nor-1. Ph.D. thesis. Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI2003Google Scholar). The 3′ boundary was delineated 34 base pairs downstream from the transcriptional start site. The nor-1 promoter region was further divided into three subfragments designated norR (right; -117 to +55 relative to the start site of transcription, +1), norM (middle), and norL (left). The 172-bp norR fragment was amplified using pAPGUSNNB as a template (33Miller M. Transcriptional Regulation of the Aspergillus parasiticus Aflatoxin Biosynthetic Pathway Gene nor-1. Ph.D. thesis. Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI2003Google Scholar) and a pair of primers: forward, 5′-TGGCATACCATCAAATGC-3′; and reverse, 5′-ATCGGTCGTGCTAGTTCTCT-3′. The fragment was gel-purified using a QIAEX II gel extraction kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA) and used for EMSA. norR subfragments R1 and R2 were synthesized using a similar protocol. PCR fragments used as probes in EMSA were cut with BamHI, gel-purified (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA), and either labeled using [32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a fill-in reaction (34Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York2003Google Scholar) or end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using Ready-to-Go Kinase (Amersham Biosciences). Preparation of Protein Extracts for EMSA—Cellular protein was extracted from A. parasiticus cultures using our modifications (31Ehrlich K.C. Montalbano B.G. Cary J.W. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 230: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) of the method of Peters and Perez-Esteban (40Peters D.G. Caddick M.X. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5164-5172Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 41Perez-Esteban B. Orejas M. Gomez-Pardo E. Penalva M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 881-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly 1-liter flasks containing 10 6-mm glass beads and 500 ml of medium (GMS or PMS) were inoculated with 1 × 108 spores. The cultures were incubated for 48 h at 29 °C in the dark with shaking at 150 rpm. The mycelia were filtered through miracloth (Calbiochem), washed with cold sterile water, frozen with liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. Frozen mycelia were ground using a mortar and pestle with liquid nitrogen. 5 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and 50 μl of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) were added per gram of ground mycelia. After stirring on ice for 15 min, saturated ammonium sulfate was slowly introduced to a final concentration of 10%. The suspension was stirred on ice for 15 min, left for 15 min on ice, and then pelleted at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Solid ammonium sulfate was added slowly to the supernatant over 1.5 h to raise the concentration to 70% while stirring on ice. The supernatant was then left for 30 min on ice without stirring. The protein was pelleted at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in dialysis buffer (15% glycerol, 15 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture, 1 ml/1 liter) and dialyzed twice in 2 liters of dialysis buffer using a 10,000 molecular weight cut-off Slide-A-Lyzer (Pierce). The dialyzed solution was aliquoted and stored at -80 °C. Using liquid culture, the results obtained with the cell protein extracts and nuclear protein extracts were similar. Because preparation of nuclear extracts from mycelia grown in solid culture did not generate satisfactory data we used cellular protein extracts throughout these studies. EMSA—Double-stranded DNA fragments were 5′ end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using Ready-To-Go T4 polynucleotide kinase (Amersham Biosciences). EMSA and competition EMSA were performed essentially as described in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (34Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York2003Google Scholar). 5% acrylamide (80:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) non-denaturing gels were used to separate DNA-protein complexes; the gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. 20 fmol of nor-1 promoter probes were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C with 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 7.5 μg bovine serum albumin, and competitor (if desired) with 32 mg of cell protein extract (added last) in a final binding reaction volume of 25 μl. Supershift EMSA—Two alternative protocols were used. For Protocol 1, fractionated cell protein extract prepared from the FadA mutant TJYP1-22 (37Hicks J.K. Yu J.H. Keller N.P. Adams T.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4916-4923Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) grown for 43 h on GMS agar was incubated in a DNA binding buffer for 1 h on ice with 2 μl of antibodies against CREB1 (C-21), CREB2 (C-20), ATF2 (N-96), and ATF3 (C-19) (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Then the 32P-labeled norR fragment was added, and incubation continued for an additional 15 min at 30 °C. Finally DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis in a 4.5% native polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film. For Protocol 2, fractionated cell protein extract prepared from FadA mutant TJYP1-22 grown for 43 h on GMS agar was incubated for 15 min at 30 °C with 32P-labeled norR. Next 2 μl of antibodies against CREB1, CREB2, ATF2, and ATF3 were added, and samples were incubated for an additional 15 min at 30 °C. The rest of the procedure was as described for Protocol 1. EMSA Using CREM-1—The DNA binding reaction contained the same components as described above except that instead of fractionated cell protein extract 20 ng, 100 ng, or 1 μg of CREM-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added last. South-Western Blot Analysis of norR-binding Proteins—The procedure was performed using a protocol previously described (42Jackson S.P. Hames B.D. Higgins S.J. Gene Transcription.

https://openalex.org/W2150111853,"Menin, the product of the tumor suppressor gene MEN1, is widely expressed in mammalian endocrine and non-endocrine tissues, including intestine. Its known abundant expression in several types of cells with high proliferative capacity led us to investigate the physiological function of the protein menin in intestinal epithelium, one of the most rapidly growing epithelia. Here we showed that the Men1 gene is mainly expressed in the crypt compartment of the proximal small intestine and that its expression was increased during fasting in vivo, both suggesting a role of menin in the control of cell growth. Indeed, specific reduction of menin expression by transfected antisense cDNA in the rat duodenal crypt-like cell line, IEC-17, increased cell proliferation. The latter is correlated to a loss of cell-cycle arrest in G1 phase by resting cells and an overexpression of cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)-4. Furthermore, these cells lost the inhibition of proliferation induced by transforming growth factor-β1, associated with a decrease of transforming growth factor-β type II receptor expression. As a result of deregulated proliferation, antisense menin transfected IEC-17 cells became tumorigenic as shown in vitro as well as in vivo in immunosuppressed animals. These results indicate that menin contributes to proliferation control in intestinal epithelial cells. The present study reveals an unknown physiological function for menin in intestine that may be important in the regulation of epithelial homeostasis.

Menin has been shown to interact directly with an ever increasing list of molecular partners such as JunD, Smad3, nm23, NF-κB (for a review, see Ref. 7Poisson A. Zablewska B. Gaudray P.

Despite the endocrine specificity of the MEN1 syndrome tumors, menin RNA and protein are widely expressed in endocrine and non-endocrine rodent and human tissues (6Maruyama K. Tsukada T. Hosono T.

In the intestinal tract of mouse and rat, menin RNA was detected by Northern blotting in small and large intestine (6Maruyama K. Tsukada T. Hosono T. Ohkura N. Kishi M. Honda M. Nara-Ashizawa N. Nagasaki K. Yamaguchi K. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 156: 25-33Google Scholar, 8Forsberg L. Zablewska B. Piehl F. Weber G. Lagercrantz S. Gaudray P. Hoog C. Larsson C. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2001; 8: 681-689Google Scholar). Interestingly, in adult human tissues, the expression of the MEN1 gene detected by in situ hybridization was predominant in actively proliferating cells such as the proliferative phase of endometrium and parabasal cells of the esophageal mucosa, but faint in the secretory phase of the endometrium (10Ikeo Y. Sakurai A. Suzuki R. Zhang M.X. Koizumi S. Takeuchi Y. Yumita W. Nakayama J. Hashizume K. Lab. Invest. 2000; 80: 797-804Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to investigate the physiological function of menin in the intestinal epithelium, which is among the most rapidly renewing tissues of the mammalian organism. First, we provide direct evidence that the Men1 gene is mainly expressed in the crypt compartment of the small intestine. We then demonstrate that menin inactivation increases cell proliferation and promotes tumorigenesis both in vitro and in vivo in intestinal epithelial cells. In Situ Hybridization—Deparaffinized mouse proximal small intestine sections were treated for 10 min with pepsin (0.4%) in 0.2 N HCl, followed by ethanol treatment and air drying. Hybridization with digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes was done at 65 °C overnight in 50% formamide, 1× salt, 1× Denhardt's solution, 10% dextran sulfate, and 250 μg/ml yeast RNA. The unhybridized probe was removed in 2× SSC twice for 5 min each at room temperature, 2× SSC and 50% formamide at 65 °C for 30 min, followed by rinses with decreasing concentrations of SSC. Nonspecific sites were blocked with 2% blocking reagent (Roche Applied Science) in 0.1 mol/liter maleic acid, 0.15 mol/liter NaCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Tween 20, and 2% goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were incubated overnight at room temperature with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated polyclonal sheep anti-digoxigenin antibody (Roche Applied Science). The reaction product was visualized using nitroblue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate (Roche Applied Science). Sense and antisense digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes were generated from linearized templates by in vitro transcription with T3 or T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of digoxigenin-UTP (Roche Applied Science). A plasmid (IMAGE clone ID.402210, Research Genetics) containing the 900-bp 3′-end of the Men1 cDNA was used as a template. The plasmid was linearized either with EcoRI and transcribed with T3 RNA polymerase, or with NotI and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase, respectively, for antisense and sense probe. The sections, first used for in situ hybridization as described above, were subjected next to fluorescent indirect immunohistochemistry with an anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen antibody (1:150, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cell Culture and Stable Transfection—The rat duodenal cell line IEC-17 (11Quaroni A. Isselbacher K.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1981; 67: 1353-1362Google Scholar) was routinely maintained in DMEM, 10% FCS, 25 units/ml insulin, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 50 mm streptomycin. The expression plasmid encoding the human menin cDNA cloned in an antisense orientation into the EcoRI site of pcDNA3.1(+) was a gift from Dr. Hendy (McGill University, Montreal, Canada) (12Kaji H. Canaff L. Lebrun J.J. Goltzman D. Hendy G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3837-3842Google Scholar). The empty pcDNA3.1 vector (V) and the pcDNA3.1/AS menin plasmid (AS) were stably transfected into IEC-17 cells using the Exgen reagent as described by the supplier (Euromedex). To select for stable expression, the transfected cells were grown in standard culture medium containing G418 (700 μg/ml) starting 2 days after transfection. Except during experiments, G418 was maintained in culture medium. Proliferation Assays—Cells were plated at 10,000 cells per well in 24-well plates. The cell number was estimated at 24-h intervals by counting with a hemacytometer the number of cells detached after trypsin treatment. DNA synthesis was determined through [3H]thymidine incorporation (1 mCi/ml) during a 4-h period as described previously (13Dumortier J. Ratineau C. Scoazec J.Y. Pourreyron C. Anderson W. Jacquier M.F. Blanc M. Bernard C. Bellaton C. Remy L. Chayvialle J.A. Roche C. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 671-683Google Scholar). Cell-cycle Analysis—Cells in growth phase were synchronized by exposing the culture to FCS-deprived DMEM supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 48 h. Quiescent cells were stimulated by the addition of 10% FCS for 24 h. Cells were harvested, fixed, and stained with propidium iodide using the BD Cycle TEST™PLUS Reagent Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences). Flow cytometry was then performed by using a Galaxy apparatus (DAKO). Luciferase Assay—Cells were seeded at 60,000 cells per well in 12-well plates. Twenty-four hours later, cells were transfected with 2 μg of the reporter plasmid (p3TP-lux or TOPFlash) and the pRL-TK plasmid expressing Renilla (0.1 μg) using Exgen reagent. The reporter system p3TP-Lux contained the TGFβ-responsive PAI-1 promoter driving luciferase expression (14Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Google Scholar). The reporter construct TOPFlash contained three copies of a mutant T cell factor-4 binding site cloned into the luciferase pGL3-basic plasmid (15Shih I.M. Yu J. He T.C. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1671-1676Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 48 h later. Luciferase and Renilla activities were measured by using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Luciferase activity was normalized to the relative Renilla activity in each experiment. RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—RNA from cells or tumor samples was prepared with TRIzol reagent (Euromedex, France). 2 μm RNA samples were reverse-transcribed for 1 h at 42 °C by avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Finnzymes) using a specific antisense primer. The PCR was carried out on 3 μl of the cDNA generated from the RT reaction, 50 pmol of each oligonucleotide pair, 0.4 mm each of 2′-deoxynucleoside 5′-triphosphate and 1.5 units of TaqDNA polymerase in 10× buffer as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen) with the following conditions: 94 °C for 30s; 55 °C for 45s; 72 °C for 45s; for 30 cycles (menin) or 20 cycles (TGFβ type II receptor (TβRII) and cyclophilin A). Primers used were as follows: pcDNA3.1 polyclonal site primer, sense, 5′-GAA CCC ACT GCT TAC TGG CTT ATC GAA-3′; human menin, antisense, 5′-GGC AGC GCA AAG GCC TCT GAA CTA CTG-3′;TβRII, sense, 5′-TCA CTA GGC ACG TCA TCA GC5–3′; TβRII, antisense, 5′-AGG ACA ACC CGA AGT CAC AC-3′; cyclophilin A, sense, 5′-CTT GTC CAT GGC AAA TGC TG-3′; cyclophilin A, antisense, 5′-GTG ATC TTC TTG CTG GTC TTG-3′. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels. Protein Preparation and Western Analysis—Cells were lysed in cold solubilization buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm Na3VO4, 100 mm NaF, 100 units/ml aprotinin, 20 μm leupeptin, and 0.2 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride. Cell extracts were clarified (14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C). Cytosolic and membrane fractions were prepared as described (16Gevrey J.C. Laurent S. Saurin J.C. Nemoz-Gaillard E. Regazzi R. Chevrier A.M. Chayvialle J.A. Abello J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 503: 19-24Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for menin expression). Western blotting was performed as described previously (13Dumortier J. Ratineau C. Scoazec J.Y. Pourreyron C. Anderson W. Jacquier M.F. Blanc M. Bernard C. Bellaton C. Remy L. Chayvialle J.A. Roche C. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 671-683Google Scholar). The polyclonal antibodies used were menin (1:1500), cyclin D1 (1:200), cyclin D3 (1: 1000), Cdk4 (1:200), TβRII (1:500) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and cyclophilin A (Upstate Biotechnology, 1:3000). The mouse monoclonal antibodies used were β-catenin (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), α-tubulin (1:25,000, Sigma), and actin (1:5000, ICN). Soft Agar Assays—IEC-17/AS and IEC-17/V cells were plated at 50,000 cells/well in 0.4 ml of DMEM supplemented with 5% FCS and 0.3% low-melting-temperature agarose (Sigma) in 12-well plates coated with a 0.75-ml layer of DMEM supplemented with 5% FCS and 0.6% low-melting-temperature agarose. Dishes were kept at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and monitored after 2 weeks for colony formation. As a positive control, we used the colonic adenocarcinoma HT-29 cell line (12.5 × 103/well) in the same conditions. Cells were photographed after 2 weeks. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Animal Studies—Tumorigenicity was assayed by subcutaneous injection of 1 × 106 IEC-17/V or IEC-17/AS cells resuspended in 50 μl of cold phosphate-buffered saline mixed with 50 μl of matrigel (BD Biosciences) in the abdominal region of Wistar newborn rats. Rats were subsequently immunodepressed as described previously (13Dumortier J. Ratineau C. Scoazec J.Y. Pourreyron C. Anderson W. Jacquier M.F. Blanc M. Bernard C. Bellaton C. Remy L. Chayvialle J.A. Roche C. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 671-683Google Scholar). Animals were sacrificed 3 weeks after cell inoculation and tumors were removed, fixed in 10% formalin, and then embedded in paraffin for histological analysis or frozen directly in liquid nitrogen for RNA analysis. Tumor volumes were calculated by the formula π/3 × length × width × thickness. Furthermore, subcutaneous dorsal injections of IEC-17/V or IEC-17/AS cells (3 × 106 cells with matrigel) were also given to 4–6 week-old athymic (Balb/c nu/nu) female mice. They were sacrificed at 6 or 12 weeks after injection. The fasting and refeeding study comprised three groups of male Swiss CD1 mice (Charles River Laboratories) as described by Nian et al. (17Nian M. Gu J. Irwin D.M. Drucker D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: R173-R183Google Scholar). Briefly, the first group of animals was fed ad libitum, the second group was deprived of food for 48 h, the third group was fasted for 48 h, followed by unrestricted access to food for 24 h. A 10-cm segment from duodeno-jejunum was harvested in the euthanized animals and rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline. Duodeno-jejunal mucosa was scraped from the underlying seromuscular layers and homogenized in buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, NaF 100 mm, EDTA 10 mm, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 1% Nonidet P-40, and complete, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Protein extracts were submitted to Western blot analysis as described above. To analyze cell proliferation in vivo, wild type and Men1 heterozygous mice (4Bertolino P. Tong W.M. Galendo D. Wang Z.Q. Zhang C.X. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1880-1892Google Scholar) were injected intraperitoneally with 1.5 mg of 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd, Roche Applied Science). Tissues were collected on the next day, fixed, and paraffin embedded. BrdUrd incorporation was evaluated by immunocytochemistry. Histochemistry and Immunostaining—Sections of the paraffin-embedded tissue samples were subjected to standard hematoxylin and eosin-staining. Detection of cytokeratin was performed by using a mouse monoclonal antibody (DAKO). Antigen-antibody complexes were revealed by the streptavidin-biotin technique (DAKO), using diaminobenzidine as chromogen. For immunocytochemical study, cells were grown in 8-well chamber slides, fixed with cold methanol, incubated for 1 h with the anti-β-catenin antibody (1:100), and followed by the appropriate fluorescent secondary antibody. Men1 Transcript Is Expressed in Intestinal Crypts and Its Expression Increased During Fasting—The expression of the Men1 transcript was examined by in situ hybridization in proximal small intestine (duodeno-jejunal segment) of mice using a riboprobe containing an antisense Men1 cDNA sequence. As depicted in Fig. 1A, Men1 transcript was strongly expressed in the crypts, whereas weak expression was seen in dispersed cells of the villi. No hybridization was detected in the muscular layers or when the sense probe was used (Fig. 1B). After hybridization, immunostaining of the sections with an anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen antibody revealed that expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, a marker of proliferative activity, correlated with the strongest Men1 expression in crypts (Fig. 1C). To connect the in vitro results to the physiological state, we used the fasting-refeeding model which decreases cell crypt proliferation (17Nian M. Gu J. Irwin D.M. Drucker D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: R173-R183Google Scholar, 18Ko T.C. Pan F. Sheng H. Brown D.B. Thompson E.A. Beauchamp R.D. World J. Surg. 2002; 26: 812-818Google Scholar). In the Western blot analysis, menin expression was stronger in the mucosa of fasted and fasted-refed animals compared with that in ad libitum-fed mice (Fig. 2), suggesting an adaptive role of menin facing altered epithelial growth. The expression of menin was also compared between Men1 heterozygous and wild-type mice of about 5 months by using Western blotting and in situ hybridization. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, no clear difference in the expression of the protein or the Men1 transcript was evidenced. Furthermore, the BrdUrd incorporation was not increased in intestinal epithelium of heterozygous mice (Fig. 3C). Use of Antisense Menin in IEC-17 Reduces Menin Expression—To study the biological effects of menin inactivation in intestinal cells, IEC-17 cells were subjected to transfection with different constructs. Twelve and seven clones were obtained after transfection of the empty vector (IEC-17/V) and the pcDNA3.1/AS menin plasmid (IEC-17/AS), respectively. One empty vector (V403) and two antisense menin (AS303 and AS313) transfectants were used throughout the study. Specific RT-PCR was performed to control the expression of human menin antisense transcripts: a strong signal was detected in the AS303 and AS313 clones but not in the control V403 clone (Fig. 4A). Western blot analysis showed a strong reduction of the rat (endogenous) menin protein expression in antisense menintransfected AS303 and AS313 clones, as compared with menin expression in empty vector-transfected cells (V403) (Fig. 4B). Antisense Menin Expression Stimulates Proliferation and Prevents G1 Arrest of Quiescent Cells—Cell proliferation was studied by performing a growth curve on a 5-day period. As shown in Fig. 5A, antisense menin-transfected cells grew faster than empty vector-transfected control cells. DNA synthesis was also assessed after [3H]thymidine incorporation. As shown in Fig. 5B, [3H]thymidine incorporation was increased 2.4- and 4-fold in AS303 and AS313 clones, respectively, as compared with the V403 clone. After a 48-h exposure to serum-deprived medium to achieve quiescence, 92% of V403 cells were arrested in G1 phase, whereas 48 and 51%, respectively, of AS303 and AS313 cells were in G1 phase, and about 22% of cells of each antisense clone entered S phase (Fig. 6A). A 24-h serum stimulation allowed V403 cells to progress in S phase (22%), whereas the percentage of AS303 and AS313 cells in S phase increased only slightly (Fig. 6B). The data evidenced disruption of the cell-cycle control in antisense menin-transfected cells. Increased Proliferation Is Associated with Increased Expression of Proteins Involved in G1 to S Progression—d-type cyclins are major positive regulators expressed during the G1 phase of the cell cycle and form complexes with their catalytic partner cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (Cdk4). As D1- and D3-type cyclin expression has been shown in cells within the crypt compartment (19Chandrasekaran C. Coopersmith C.M. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28414-28421Google Scholar) and in a rat intestinal cell line (20Ko T.C. Sheng H.M. Reisman D. Thompson E.A. Beauchamp R.D. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 177-184Google Scholar), their expression, as well as that of Cdk4, was investigated in the three clones. For this purpose, cells were grown in complete culture medium for 24 h and then serum-deprived for 24 h. The immunoblotting data in Fig. 7 showed that cyclin D1, cyclin D3, and Cdk4 expression in serum-starved, quiescent IEC-17 clones was up-regulated in antisense menin-transfected clones. Overexpression of Cyclin D1 Does Not Involve the β-Catenin Pathway—Because cyclin D1 expression is regulated by β-catenin through transcriptional activation of the cyclin D1 gene (21Shtutman M. Zhurinsky J. Simcha I. Albanese C. D'Amico M. Pestell R. Ben-Ze'ev A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5522-5527Google Scholar), we investigated whether an increase in the cytoplasmic level of β-catenin in the antisense menin-transfected clones could be responsible for the abnormally high cyclin D1 expression. Protein extracts were prepared from cytoplasmic and membrane fractions and analyzed by Western blotting. The comparative level of β-catenin in the cytoplasmic versus the membrane compartment was similar in antisense menin-transfected clones and in the empty vector-transfected clone (Fig. 8A). Furthermore, a strong membranous expression of β-catenin was seen in V403, AS 303, and AS 313 cells by immunostaining (Fig. 8B). Finally, the TOPFlash reporter gene activity was compared in the three clones as well as in the colorectal cancer cell line Isreco-1 used as control (because of its mutation in the APC gene; Ref. 22Gayet J. Zhou X.P. Duval A. Rolland S. Hoang J.M. Cottu P. Hamelin R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5025-5032Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 8C, TOPFlash activity was very low in V403, AS303, and AS 313 cells, whereas in Isreco-1 cells, TOPFlash activity was more than 300-fold higher. These data suggest that the overexpression of cyclin D1 was not induced by a deregulation of the β-catenin pathway. Menin Inactivation Antagonizes TGFβ1-mediated Inhibition of Cell Proliferation and Down-regulates the Expression of TβRII—Because the proliferation of IEC-17-expressing antisense menin cDNA was increased, sensibility to TGFβ1, a growth factor known to inhibit intestinal epithelial cell proliferation (23Barnard J.A. Beauchamp R.D. Coffey R.J. Moses H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1578-1582Google Scholar), was assessed. As expected, [3H]thymidine incorporation in V403 cells was inhibited by ∼55% when exposed to 10 ng/ml of TGFβ1. Conversely, AS303 and AS313 cells showed only a small, non-significant decrease of [3H]thymidine incorporation (6 and 13%, respectively) (Fig. 9A). The expression of TβRII was studied by Western analysis using a specific antiserum. A decrease of TβRII expression was observed in the two antisense menin-expressing clones (Fig. 9B). Furthermore, RT-PCR demonstrated a decrease of the TβRII transcript (Fig. 9C). Finally, we examined whether the TGFβ1 signaling pathway was also affected. To address this question, we selected the validated TGFβ1-responsive PAI-1 promoter (14Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Google Scholar). V403, AS303, and AS313 cells were transiently transfected with the 3TP-Lux construct. As expected, the transcriptional activity of the PAI-1 promoter was increased by TGFβ1 in V403 cells. This effect was maintained in AS303 and only slightly reduced in clone AS313 (Fig. 9D). Reduced Menin Expression Is Associated with Tumorigenic Transformation of IEC-17 Cells—V403, AS303, and AS313 clones were tested for their anchorage-independent growth in a colony-forming soft agar assay. The colon carcinoma HT-29 cell line was used as positive control, forming large colonies under the given experimental conditions. V403 cells did not form any colonies in soft agar, whereas AS303 and AS313 cells grew numerous small colonies (Fig. 10A). To test the ability of these cells to form tumors in vivo, cells were injected subcutaneously into immuno-suppressed newborn rats using matrigel as adjuvant. Matrigel was previously described as providing strong mitogenic support for the rapid growth of non-aggressive cells (24Soubeyran P. Haglund K. Garcia S. Barth B.U. Iovanna J. Dikic I. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4180-4187Google Scholar). At sacrifice 21 days after injection, the V403 clone did not induce any tumors in the 23 rats used for the study. On the contrary, injections of AS303 and AS313 clones promoted the formation of small tumors in 30/30 rats and 27/29 rats, respectively. Injections without the addition of matrigel were also performed with the V403 and AS303 clones. Only the later cell line gave tiny tumors (data not shown). To confirm that the tumors obtained did indeed result from the growth of antisense menin-transfected cells, the presence of antisense menin transcripts (derived from the antisense cDNA) was checked by specific RT-PCR performed with total RNA prepared from tumor samples. The two tumors used in this experiment expressed the same antisense menin transcript as the parental AS303 clone grown in culture (Fig. 10B). V403 clone in culture was used as a negative control. Tumors obtained after subcutaneous injection of IEC-17/AS clones in immuno-suppressed newborn rats ranged from 47 to 293 mm3 (mean ± S.D. = 141 ± 21 mm3) for AS303 clone and 17 to 167 mm3 (59 ± 12 mm3) for AS313 clone. They were formed by large lobules of medium-sized, monomorphic cells, characterized by a high nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio, a large, often nucleolated nucleus, and scarce or limited cytoplasm (Fig. 2C, left panel). The epithelial nature of IEC-17 cells was demonstrated by their constant expression of cytokeratins, as detected using a pan-cytokeratin antibody (Fig. 10C, right panel). The tumors did not express chromogranin A, a specific marker of endocrine cells (data not shown). Tumor lobules were associated with an abundant fibrous stroma. They were located mainly in the subcutaneous tissue, but sheets of tumor cells constantly invaded the adjacent dermis and muscle layers (Fig. 10C, left panel). Similar tumors were obtained after subcutaneous injection of V403, AS303, and AS313 clones into nude mice (data not shown). The development of endocrine tumors in patients carrying germline mutations of the MEN1 gene and the frequently observed LOH in MEN1 tumor led to the assumption that menin is a tumor-suppressor (2Crabtree J.S. Scacheri P.C. Ward J.M. Garrett-Beal L. Emmert-Buck M.R. Edgemon K.A. Lorang D. Libutti S.K. Chandrasekharappa S.C. Marx S.J. Spiegel A.M. Collins F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The broad expression of menin, however, does not fit an exclusive role in endocrine structures. In fact, menin mRNA is especially abundant in proliferative cell types, such as endometrium or parabasal cells of the esophagus (10Ikeo Y. Sakurai A. Suzuki R. Zhang M.X. Koizumi S. Takeuchi Y.

UTE-1 is a regulatory DNA motif essential for TIMP1 promoter activity in a variety of cell types including hepatic stellate cells (HSC), the key profibrogenic cells of the liver. In this study we identify RUNX1 and RUNX2 as UTE-1-binding proteins that are induced at the post-transcriptional level during activation of HSC. RUNX1 is expressed in at least two major isoforms, RUNX1B and RUNX1A. Overexpression of full-length RUNX1B isoform in HSC repressed TIMP1 promoter activity, whereas the truncated RUNX1A isoform and RUNX2 functioned as stimulators. To gain further understanding of the way in which RUNX1 isoforms differentially regulate TIMP1 transcription, we investigated the relationship between the UTE-1 site and its adjacent upstream serum-response element (SRE) in the promoter. The UTE-1 and SRE sites cooperate in a synergistic fashion to stimulate transcription of a heterologous minimal active promoter providing that they are in close proximity. The key regulatory sequence within the SRE is an AP-1 site that in HSC directs high level transcription via its interaction with JunD. RUNX1A was shown to interact directly with JunD, and by contrast RUNX1B failed to interact with JunD. Co-expression studies showed that RUNX1B can repress JunD-stimulated TIMP1 promoter activity. From these observations we propose that JunD and RUNX factors assemble at the adjacent SRE and UTE-1 sites in the TIMP1 promoter and form functional interactions that stimulate transcription. However, RUNX1B is unable to interact with JunD, and as such its occupancy at the UTE-1 site disrupts the optimal assembly of transcriptional activators required for directing high level TIMP1 promoter function.

The maintenance of normal tissue structure is in part dependent on the balance between the expression and activity of the ECM-degrading matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and the expression of their naturally occurring tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) (1Cawston T. Mol. Med. Today. 1998; 4: 130-137Google Scholar). Disruption of this finely tuned balance may result in uncontrolled restructuring of the ECM and as a consequence to the disruption of normal tissue architecture and function. Diseases associated with changes in the ratio of the expression/activity of TIMPs and MMPs include arthritis (1Cawston T. Mol. Med. Today. 1998; 4: 130-137Google Scholar), fibrosis (2Friedman S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2247-2250Google Scholar), tissue ulceration (3Visse R. Nagase H. Circ. Res. 2003; 8: 827-839Google Scholar), cancer (4Lukashev M.E. Werb Z. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 437-441Google Scholar, 5Sternlicht M.D. Lochter A. Sympson C.J. Huey B. Rougier J.P. Gray J.W. Pinkel D. Bissell M.J. Werb Z. Cell. 1999; 98: 137-1463Google Scholar), cardiovascular diseases (6Batchelor W.B. Robinson R. Strauss B.H. Prog. Cardiovasc. Dis. 1998; 41: 35-49Google Scholar), neurological disorders (7Bever Jr., C.T. Rosenberg G.A. Neurology. 1999; 53: 1380-1381Google Scholar), and asthma (8Ohbayashi H. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2002; 4: 409-421Google Scholar). The mammalian TIMPs are a family of four (TIMP1, TIMP2, TIMP3, and TIMP4) proteinase inhibitors that suppress ECM degradation by forming an inhibitory 1:1 complex with the MMPs (9Murphy G. Docherty A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1992; 7: 120-125Google Scholar). TIMP1 is the prototypic and original ancestral member of the mammalian TIMP family. In addition to acting as an inhibitor of the activity of most of the known MMPs, TIMP1 has several other important biological functions. The ability of TIMP1 to promote cell proliferation has been described for a wide range of cell types, and it is a property that is independent of its MMP-inhibitory activity but may instead result from interaction of TIMP1 with an as yet uncharacterized cell-surface receptor (10Hayakawa T. Yamashita K. Tanzawa K. Uchijima E. Iwata K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 298: 29-32Google Scholar). Additionally, studies in a number of cell types including B-cells, human breast epithelial cells, rat kidney mesangial cells, and human and rat hepatic stellate cells (HSC) have revealed an anti-apoptotic function for TIMP1 (11Guedez L. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Wolff L. Wang J. Fukushima P. Mansoor A. Stetler-Stevenson M. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 2002-2010Google Scholar, 12Li G.Y. Fridman R. Kim H.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6267-6275Google Scholar, 13Lin H. Chen X. Wang J. Yu Z. Kidney Int. 2002; 62: 60-69Google Scholar, 14Murphy F.R. Issa R. Zhou X. Ratnarajah S. Nagase H. Arthur M.J. Benyon C. Iredale J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11069-11076Google Scholar). TIMP1 is a key regulator of fibrogenic events in the liver. This is supported by the finding that the extent of carbon tetrachloride-induced liver fibrosis is elevated in mice that overexpress TIMP1 from a liver-specific TIMP1 transgene (15Yoshiji H. Kuriyama S. Miyamoto Y. Thorgeirsson U.P. Gomez D.E. Kawata M. Yoshii J. Ikenaka Y. Noguchi R. Tsujinoue H. Nakatani T. Thorgeirsson S.S. Fukui H. Hepatology. 2000; 32: 1248-1254Google Scholar). The major cellular source of TIMP1 in the injured liver is the activated HSC (aHSC) (16Arthur M.J. Iredale J.P. Mann D.A. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1999; 23: 940-943Google Scholar). HSC are found in the normal liver in a quiescent state in which their major function appears to be the storage of vitamin A. After injury the HSC activates or trans-differentiates into a proliferating myofibroblast-like cell that produces abundant levels of fibrillar collagen (principally collagen I and III) and TIMP1 (16Arthur M.J. Iredale J.P. Mann D.A. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1999; 23: 940-943Google Scholar). Secretion of abundant levels of TIMP1 by aHSC leads to decreased hepatic collagenase activity and thereby promotes the accumulation of cross-linked collagen. A second way in which TIMP1 regulates the fibrogenic process is to inhibit apoptosis of aHSC enabling the collagen-secreting cells to persist in the injured liver (14Murphy F.R. Issa R. Zhou X. Ratnarajah S. Nagase H. Arthur M.J. Benyon C. Iredale J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11069-11076Google Scholar). Manipulating the expression of TIMP1 by aHSC may therefore offer a therapeutic strategy, and as such it is of importance to learn more about the molecular events that regulate TIMP1 gene transcription. We have reported previously (17Bahr M.J. Vincent K.J. Arthur M.J. Fowler A.V. Smart D.E. Wright M.C. Clark I.M. Benyon R.C. Iredale J.P. Mann D.A. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 839-848Google Scholar) that TIMP1 promoter activity is induced during the culture-induced activation of freshly isolated HSC. The TIMP1 promoter is structurally conserved between rodents and humans and contains functional binding sites for AP-1 (Fos/Jun), Pea3 (Ets), and STATs located within a 22-bp serum-response element (SRE) and motifs for SP-1 and LBP-1 transcription factors (17Bahr M.J. Vincent K.J. Arthur M.J. Fowler A.V. Smart D.E. Wright M.C. Clark I.M. Benyon R.C. Iredale J.P. Mann D.A. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 839-848Google Scholar). A non-canonical AP-1 site (5′-TGAGTAA-3′) located at the 5′ end of the minimal active TIMP1 promoter (-102 to +60) is essential for high level transcriptional activity in aHSC and operates by binding JunD which is the predominant Jun family protein in these cells (17Bahr M.J. Vincent K.J. Arthur M.J. Fowler A.V. Smart D.E. Wright M.C. Clark I.M. Benyon R.C. Iredale J.P. Mann D.A. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 839-848Google Scholar, 18Smart D.E. Vincent K.J. Arthur M.J. Eickelberg O. Castellazzi M. Mann J. Mann D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24414-24421Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies on the human TIMP1 promoter have also functionally implicated a second, but so far poorly defined, regulatory motif called the upstream TIMP1 element 1 (UTE-1) (19Trim J.E. Samra S.K. Arthur M.J. Wright M.C. McAulay M. Beri R. Mann D.A J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6657-6663Google Scholar). The UTE-1 motif (5′-TGTGGTTTCCG-3′) is located at -62 to -52, which is 10 bp downstream of the SRE. The UTE-1 element is required for high level promoter activity in a wide variety of cell types, including aHSC, and was shown to bind a 30-kDa nuclear protein. The main goal of the present study was to identify transcription factors that regulate TIMP1 promoter activity via the UTE-1 site. By using a yeast one-hybrid approach, we have identified members of the RUNX transcription factor family as UTE-1-binding proteins and for the first time as regulators of TIMP1 gene transcription. The regulation and role of RUNX1 and -2 as controllers of TIMP1 expression in HSC is described. Cell Isolation and Culture—COS1, HeLa, and the human LX2 hepatic stellate cell line (20Taimr P. Higuchi H. Kocova E. Rippe R.A. Friedman S. Gores G.J. Hepatology. 2003; 37: 87-95Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Primary HSC were isolated from normal liver of 6-month-old, 500-g male Sprague-Dawley rats by sequential perfusion with collagenase and Pronase, followed by purification by discontinuous density centrifugation in 11.5% (v/v) OptiPREP (Invitrogen). Human HSC were isolated from the liver of adult males following partial hepatectomy and were isolated and purified essentially as described for rat HSC. Isolated HSC were cultured on plastic or Matrigel (BD Biosciences)-coated culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 16% (v/v) fetal calf serum and were maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% (v/v) CO2. HSC were routinely detached from plastic or coated dishes by a non-enzymatic method that involved incubation of cells with Matrisperse (BD Biosciences) for 5–10 min at 37 °C. Detached cells were then recovered by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min prior to resuspension in media and seeding onto either plastic or coated dishes. For coating culture dishes with Matrigel (BD Biosciences), 1.5 ml of growth factor-reduced Matrigel (in a 2:1 mixture with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) was evenly spread across a 90-mm plastic dish to generate a thin layer (∼0.5 mm) of matrix. All cells were maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% (v/v) CO2. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed using a ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Formaldehyde cross-linking was performed for 5 min in LX2 cells, and sonication of chromatin was carried out in a sonication water bath twice for 3 min. 4 μl of anti-RUNX1 (active motif) or 4 μl of anti-Notch2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used in the immunoprecipitation. PCR primers used to amplify the minimal promoter region (-102 to +60) of the human TIMP1 promoter are as follows: forward 5′-GTAGGTCTCGAGGGTGGGTGGATGAGTAATGCA-3′ and reverse 5′-CAAGAAGCTTCCCAGCTCCGGTCCCTGCTG-3′. PCR conditions were 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s and a final extension step at 72 °C for 7 min. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—UTE-1 DNA binding activities were determined as described previously (19Trim J.E. Samra S.K. Arthur M.J. Wright M.C. McAulay M. Beri R. Mann D.A J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6657-6663Google Scholar). Briefly, standard EMSA reactions consisted of an initial incubation (at 4 °C) of nuclear extract (5 μg) with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) in a total volume of 18 μl for 10 min. Annealed double-stranded 5′ end-labeled oligonucleotide probes (2 μl; 0.1 ng μl-1) were then added to the EMSA reaction and incubated for a further 20 min at 4 °C. The UTE-1 probe was generated by annealing a sense strand oligonucleotide with its antisense oligonucleotide (Table I). Following incubation, the EMSA reaction mixtures were then resolved by electrophoresis on 8% (v/v) non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels (37:5:1). For determination of specificity of DNA binding, competitive EMSAs were used in which binding of proteins to the UTE-1 probe were challenged by a 10-min pre-incubation (prior to addition of the probe) with 200 ng (100-fold excess) of unlabeled doublestranded specific (UTE-1) or nonspecific (C/EBP) oligonucleotides. To generate the double-stranded C/EBP competitor, a sense strand oligonucleotide was annealed with its antisense strand (Table I). For detection of specific transcription factors as components of retardation complexes, EMSA reactions were incubated in the presence of 4 μg of anti-RUNX1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-RUNX2 (active motif), or anti-JunD (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).Table IOligonucleotides used for construction of promotor constructsUTE-1 probe Upper5′ - AGGCCTGTGGTTTCCGCACC - 3′ Lower5′ - GGTGCGGAAACCACAGGCCT - 3′C/EBP probe Upper5′ - TCCCTTTGTAGTGTTTCCCAACTCA - 3′ Lower5′ - TGAGTTGGGAAACACTACAAAGGGA - 3′pSU Upper5′ - CTAGAGATGAGTAATGCTCCAGGAGCCTGGAGGCCTGTGGTTTCCGCACCCG - 3′ Lower5′ - GATCCGGGTGCGGAAACCACAGGCCTCCAGGCTCCTGGAGCATTACTCATCT - 3′pSmU Upper5′ - CTAGAGATGAGTAATGCTCCAGGAGCCTGGAGGCCTGTTAGTTCCGCACCCG - 3′ Lower5′ - GATCCGGGTGCGGAACTAACAGGCCTCCAGGCTCCTGGAGCATTACTCATCT - 3′pUS Upper5′ - CTAGAAGGCCTGTGGTTTCCGCACCCGATGAGTAATGCTCCAGGAGCCTGG - 3′ Lower5′ - GATCCCCAGGCTCCTGGAGCATTACTCATCGGGTGCGGAAACCACAGGCCTTT - 3′pSrU Upper5′ - CTAGAGATGAGTAATGCTCCAGGAGCCTGGAGGCCGCTTTGGTGTCACCC - 3′ Lower5′ - GGGTGACACCAAAGCGGCCTCCAGGCTCCTGGAGCATTACTCATCTC - 3′1xUTE-1-CAT Upper5′ - CTAGATGTGGTTTCCGG - 3′ Lower5′ - GATCCCGGAAACCACAT - 3′pSdU Upper5′ - GGGTGTGGTTTCG - 3′ Lower5′ - GAGCTCAAACCACACCC - 3′ Open table in a new tab Immunoprecipitation—FLAG immunoprecipitation was carried out by using FLAG® immunoprecipitation kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 1 × 10 (5Sternlicht M.D. Lochter A. Sympson C.J. Huey B. Rougier J.P. Gray J.W. Pinkel D. Bissell M.J. Werb Z. Cell. 1999; 98: 137-1463Google Scholar) COS-1 cells were transfected with 3 μg of pLNCX-FLAG-RUNX1A or pLNCX-FLAG-RUNX1B (both gift from I. Kitabayashi, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Japan) and 1 μg of PCMV2-JunD or PCMV2. 48 h later, cells were lysed, and the lysate was incubated overnight with 30 μl of prewashed FLAG-agarose beads with shaking at 4 °C. Beads were then washed four times in 1× wash buffer (Sigma), resuspended in 1 volume of Western loading buffer (Invitrogen), and boiled for 10 min at 90 °C. The presence of immunoprecipitated proteins was detected by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting by using anti-FLAG (Sigma) or anti-JunD (Sigma) antibodies. Northern Blotting—Total cellular RNA was isolated from rat HSCs subcultured on either plastic or Matrigel-coated plates using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). 5 μg of each sample RNA was then resolved on a MOPS/formaldehyde 1.2% (w/v) agarose gel and transferred under negative pressure to Hybond XL (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were then subjected to Northern analysis by using a human TIMP1 partial (0.6 kb) cDNA probe labeled with [32P]dCTP using an oligonucleotide labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). Following hybridization, membranes were first washed in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS (w/v) at room temperature (two washes) and at 52 °C (two washes). Membranes were then washed at 52 °C in 1× SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS followed by one final rinse in 0.5× SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS also at 52 °C. Membranes were then subjected to autoradiography using Kodak MXB autoradiography film (GRI) for 72 h at -80 °C. Plasmid DNAs, Transfections, and Reporter Gene Assay—Heterologous synthetic promoter constructs were generated by T4 DNA ligase (Promega)-mediated recombination of phosphorylated and annealed oligonucleotides carrying XbaI and BamHI overhangs into XbaI/BamHI-digested pBLCAT2. SRE-UTE-1-CAT (pSU), SRE-mutUTE-1-CAT (pSmU), UTE-1-SRE-CAT (pUS), SRE-revUTE-1-CAT (pSrU), and SRE-distalUTE-1-CAT (pSdU) were generated by using sense and antisense oligonucleotides listed Table I. 1×, 2×, and 4× UTE-1-CAT vectors were generated by insertion of double-stranded oligonucleotides (Table I) carrying 1, 2, or 4 tandem UTE-1 sites into XbaI/BamHI-digested pBLCAT2. pSdU was generated by insertion of double-stranded oligonucleotides into the SmaI/SacI site located at position 2239 downstream of the t intron and polyadenylation signals from SV40 in pBLCAT2. Four tandem UTE-1 sites were also cloned into SmaI/SacI-digested pGL2 promoter vector (Promega). Verification of all synthetic promoter constructs was made by DNA sequence analysis. Determination of TIMP1 promoter activity was carried out by using a previously described minimal active 162-bp human TIMP1 promoter upstream of a CAT gene (17Bahr M.J. Vincent K.J. Arthur M.J. Fowler A.V. Smart D.E. Wright M.C. Clark I.M. Benyon R.C. Iredale J.P. Mann D.A. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 839-848Google Scholar). Expression of RUNX and transcriptional co-activator proteins in cells was achieved by transfection of expression vectors for pCMV5-RUNX1B (gift from S. Hiebert, Vanderbilt Cancer Center), pLNCX-FLAG-RUNX1A (gift from I. Kitabayashi, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Japan), pCMV5-RUNX2 (gift from P.

Cells were transfected using Effectene (Qiagen) and were harvested 48 h later, and CAT assays were determined as described previously (17Bahr M.J. Vincent K.J. Arthur M.J. Fowler A.V. Smart D.E. Wright M.C. Clark I.M. Benyon R.C. Iredale J.P. Mann D.A. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 839-848Google Scholar). Luciferase assays were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—DNase I-treated whole cell RNA was used for synthesis of by using Moloney murine leukemia virusreverse transcriptase (Promega) and random hexamer primers (Promega). PCR amplification of RUNX1, RUNX2, RUNX3, and β-actin cDNA species was carried out by using oligonucleotide primers selected within the coding regions of the genes and are listed in Table II. PCR products were resolved by electrophoresis through a 1% (w/v) agarose gel, detected by ethidium bromide staining, and verified as being amplified from the predicted cDNA species by DNA sequencing.Table IIPrimers used for amplification of RUNX transcriptsPrimersATAmplicon size°CbpRat geneRUNX1 Upper5′ - AGGCAAGATGAGCGAGGCGTTG - 3′58.9657 Lower5′ - TGAGGGTTAAAGGCAGTGGAGT - 3′RUNX2 Upper5′ - GCTCCGGAATGCCTCTGCTGTTAT - 3′59.2590,420 Lower5′ - CACCTGCCTGGCTCTTCTTACTGA - 3′RUNX3 Upper5′ - CAGCCAGGCCCAGACCCCAATCCA - 3′66.6535 Lower5′ - GTCCATGCGGCCCGGTGTGCTCAG - 3′β-Actin Upper5′ - AGAGGGAAATCGTGCGTGACA - 3′57453 Lower5′ - ACATCTGCTGGAAGGTGGACA - 3′Human geneRUNX1A Upper5′ - CACTGGCGCTGCAACAAGACC - 3′60.1687 Lower5′ - GGGGGAGAAGGGACACGGAGGAAT - 3′RUNX1B Upper5′ - AGATGTAGGGCTAGAGGGGTGAGG - 3′59.7674 Lower5′ - TTGCGGTGGGTTTGTGAAGA - 3′RUNX2 Upper5′ - GCTCCGGAATGCCTCTGCTGTTAT - 3′59.2590,420 Lower5′ - CACCTGCCTGGCTCTTCTTACTGA - 3′RUNX3 Upper5′ - TCCCAGGCCCAGAGAAGATGAGTC - 3′58.2563 Lower5′ - AGAGGGGGCGGGGATGTTGCTTAT - 3′ Open table in a new tab SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Whole cell protein extracts were prepared, processed, and fractionated by electrophoresis through a 9% (v/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subsequently subjected to immunoblotting as described previously (17Bahr M.J.

Detection of specific proteins by immunoblotting was achieved by using antibodies specifically recognizing RUNX1 (active motif), RUNX2 (active motif), or FLAG (Sigma) tag. Yeast One-hybrid System—Screening for cDNA clones that express UTE-1-binding proteins was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol (Matchmaker One-hybrid System, Clontech). Briefly, four tandem copies of the 11-bp UTE-1 motif (5′-TGTGGTTTCCG-3′) were inserted upstream of the HIS3 or lacZ reporter gene by designing two antiparallel 4xUTE-1 oligonucleotides with appropriate restriction sites at the ends. Annealed oligonucleotides were cloned into pHISi and pLacZi reporter plasmids (Clontech). Both UTE-1 reporter constructs were integrated into the genome of YM4271 strain to generate UTE-1 reporter strains. Background HIS3 activity was ablated using 45 mm 3-aminotrizole (Sigma). Screening UTE-1 reporter strains with HeLa pACT2 cDNA library (Clontech) identified genes encoding UTE-1-binding proteins. Plasmids were isolated from yeast clones capable of growing in the presence of 45 mm 3-aminotrizole in YPDA media (Clontech) lacking histidine and showing a positive signal in the β-galactosidase assay. Plasmids from the positive clones were transformed into competent HB101 bacteria (Promega) and purified using Maxiprep kit (Qiagen). They were transformed into three different yeast reporter strains that contained within their genome the lacZ gene under control of either four copies of UTE-1 or mutated UTE-1 (5′-TGTTAGTTCCG-3′) or three copies of the p53-binding sequence. The activation of the lacZ gene was determined using the β-galactosidase assay. Briefly, after 3 days of growth at 30 °C, the transformed colonies were lifted up by rubbing on a sterile Whatman paper No. 5 filter (Fisher) and transferred to a pool of liquid nitrogen for a freeze-thaw cycle. Another filter was presoaked in buffer Z (Na2HPO4·7H2O60mm, NaH2PO4·H2O40mm, KCl 10 mm, MgSO4·7H2O 0.1 mm, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) 33 mg/ml, β-mercaptoethanol 0.27% (v/v)) and placed beneath the previous filter. The filters were incubated at room temperature until the colonies turned blue because of the activity of β-galactosidase. UTE-1 DNA Binding Activity Is Associated with the Activated Phenotype of HSC and TIMP1 Gene Transcription—Freshly isolated HSC can be effectively maintained in a quiescent state for several days when they are cultured on Matrigel (21Friedman S.L. Roll F.J. Boyles J. Arenson D.M. Bissell D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10756-10762Google Scholar). Moreover, when culture-activated HSC are detached from plastic and seeded onto Matrigel, several classic morphological and biochemical markers of HSC activation are repressed indicative of a reversal to the quiescent phenotype (22Gaca M.D. Zhou X. Issa R. Kiriella K. Iredale J.P. Benyon R.C. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 229-239Google Scholar). We reasoned that if UTE-1 DNA binding activity is a phenotypic feature of aHSC, then we should observe suppression of the induction of UTE-1 DNA binding in freshly isolated HSC cultured on Matrigel and inhibition of UTE-1 DNA binding in aHSC seeded onto Matrigel. As reported previously, Fig. 1a shows that culture activation of rat HSC is associated with induction of TIMP1 mRNA expression at day 5 of culture which correlates with the time at which HSC begins to adopt an activated phenotype (16Arthur M.J. Iredale J.P. Mann D.A. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1999; 23: 940-943Google Scholar). Culture of freshly isolated rat HSC on Matrigel suppressed induction of UTE-1 DNA binding activity, whereas Fig. 1b confirms that this effect was accompanied by suppression of the induction of TIMP1 mRNA expression. The eventual appearance of UTE-1 DNA binding activity in cells cultured for 8 days is most probably because of the fact that the HSC in these long term cultures migrated beneath the gel and contacted plastic. aHSC seeded onto Matrigel under-went a rapid diminution of both UTE-1 binding activity (Fig. 1c) and TIMP1 mRNA expression (Fig. 1d). These data suggest that there is a close association between the activated phenotype of HSC and UTE-1 activity. The UTE-1 Site Functions Cooperatively with the SRE of the TIMP1 Promoter—To characterize further the function of the UTE-1 site, a series of synthetic heterologous reporter constructs were designed in which the UTE-1 site was located either singly or in multiple tandem copies immediately upstream of the minimal thymidine kinase promoter. Transfection experiments in either 3T3 fibroblasts or rat aHSC showed that the UTE-1 site is unable to stimulate transcription either alone or when present as two tandem copies (Fig. 2a). However, a construct containing four tandem copies of the UTE-1 site was substantially more active than the control minimal thymidine kinase promoter construct. These data suggest that the UTE-1 site is unable to function in isolation, and in the context of the TIMP1 promoter probably operates in cooperation with multiple cis-acting regulatory elements. As the UTE-1 motif is located just 10 bp downstream from the SRE in the TIMP1 promoter, a series of constructs were designed to test whether the UTE-1 and SRE sites are functionally associated. Transfections in 3T3 fibroblasts and aHSC showed that combination of the TIMP1 SRE with a single UTE-1 site resulted in a synergistic enhancement of transcription (Fig. 2b). In the case of aHSC, a significant increase in transcription over that detected from the thymidine kinase promoter alone was only observed when both the SRE and UTE-1 elements were present. To determine whether there is a positional requirement for these effects, the UTE-1 site was relocated either 10 bp upstream of the SRE site (pUS) or at a more distal site from the SRE (pSdU) (Fig. 2c). A construct was also designed in which the UTE-1 site was located in its wild type position relative to the SRE only in reverse orientation (pSrU). UTE-1 operated synergistically with the SRE site when located upstream or in reverse orientation. However, synergism was lost when the UTE-1 site was distal to the SRE (pSdU). Taken together these data indicate that factors binding to the UTE-1 site may functionally interact with members of the AP-1 and Ets family of transcription factors at the SRE to regulate TIMP1 promoter activity. Identification of UTE-1 factors was therefore a priority for understanding how TIMP1 transcription is controlled. The UTE-1 Site Binds RUNX Family Transcription Factors—The yeast one-hybrid system was employed to isolate cDNAs encoding human UTE-1 DNA-binding proteins utilizing four UTE-1 sites upstream of the His and LacZ yeast one-hybrid selection vectors. By using a HeLa cDNA library we selected three clones that survived in media lacking histidine and were able to transactivate a 4X-UTE-1-LacZ vector but were unable to transactivate control 4×-mutated UTE-1- and p53-LacZ vectors (Fig. 3a). Nuclear extract from clone B, which displayed the strongest LacZ expression, generated a sequencespecific UTE-1 protein-DNA complex (Fig. 3b). By contrast the remaining two clones which only generated weak LacZ expression lacked sequence-specific UTE-1 DNA binding activity. Sequence analysis of clone B revealed perfect identity with the published cDNA sequence for human RUNX1 (GenBank™ accession number NM_001754). To determine whether RUNX factors are stimulators of UTE-1-dependent gene transcription, 4X-UTE-1-Luc was co-transfected with expression vectors for RUNX1 (1B) and RUNX2. Western blotting of transfected COS1 cells confirmed protein expression from the vectors, and promoter studies showed that both RUNX factors stimulate 4X-UTE-1-Luc activity (Fig. 3c). To confirm that RUNX factors are UTE-1-binding proteins in aHSC, we initially used EMSAs"

Glucose, an essential substrate for brain oxidative metabolism, is transported across the blood-brain barrier and into neurons and glia by a family of structurally related membrane-spanning glycoproteins termed the facilitative glucose transporters (1Bell G.I.

Whereas GLUT 1 is expressed by endothelial cells lining the microvasculature and glial cells, which are components of the blood-brain barrier (10Devaskar S.U. Zahm D.S. Holtzclaw L. Chundu K.

We and others have reported previously that although the spatial distribution of GLUT 3 in brain is not age-dependent (12Fields H.M. Rinaman L. Devaskar S.U. Brain Res. 1999; 846: 260-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), a temporal distribution exists with low amounts noted during the embryonic/fetal and early postnatal stages and peak amounts at day 14-21 (13Khan J.Y. Rajakumar R.A. McKnight R.A. Devaskar U.P. Devaskar S.U. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 45: R892-R900Google Scholar), which coincides with the timing of synaptogenesis (14Sachs G.M. Jacobson M.

Neuron. 2001; 31: 305-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In addition, GLUT 3 localization to the synaptic region and its vesicular trafficking, which involves SNAP-25 and syntaxin-1, proteins of the SNARE complex present in synaptic vesicles, supports a role for GLUT 3 in neurotransmission (17Greenlee M.H.W. Uemura E. Carpenter S.L. Doyle R.T. Buss J.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 73: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Brain 2-deoxyglucose uptake serves as a surrogate marker for neuronal activity (18Chugani H.T. Phelps M.E. Science. 1986; 231: 840-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar); thus GLUT 3, which mediates this glucose uptake, must play a major role in fueling neurotransmission (19Maher F. Davies-Hill T.M. Simpson I.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 827-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Depolarization of neurons in vitro by the presence of extracellular K+ ions or N-methyl-D-aspartate led to an increase in GLUT 3 concentrations, providing credence to this concept (20Maher F. Simpson I.A. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1994; 5: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).Both the processes of neuro-development and depolarization of cultured neurons cause a pre-translational increase in neuronal GLUT 3 expression (13Khan J.Y.

Cell Neurosci. 1994; 5: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Furthermore, conditions of substrate deficiency such as chronic hypoglycemia or hypoxic ischemia, which depolarize neurons, also pre-translationally increase neuronal GLUT 3 concentrations (21Lee D.E.

By determining transcriptional mechanism(s) underlying the pre-translational increase in neuronal GLUT 3 expression, we had previously characterized the murine Glut 3 promoter. We demonstrated that the murine Glut 3 promoter activity resides in the -203- to +237-bp region of the gene, with reference to the transcriptional start site (23Rajakumar R.A. Thamotharan S. Menon R.K. Devaskar S.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27474-27483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Additionally, we demonstrated nuclear factors Sp1 to repress and Sp3 to activate Glut 3 gene transcription in cultured murine neuroblasts (23Rajakumar R.A. Thamotharan S. Menon R.K. Devaskar S.U. J.

In the present study, we extended these observations by determining whether Sp1 and Sp3 present in postnatal murine brain nuclear extracts could bind to the identified Glut 3 promoter cis-elements. We have also confirmed that by in vivo Sp3, and we established that in vitro and in vivo phosphorylated cyclic AMP-regulatory element-binding (pCREB) 1The abbreviations used are: pCREB, phosphorylated cAMP-regulatory element-binding protein; ChiP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; Si, small interference RNA; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; EMSA, electromobility shift assay; oligo, oligonucleotide; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; CBP, CREB-binding protein; AP-1, activator protein-1.1The abbreviations used are: pCREB, phosphorylated cAMP-regulatory element-binding protein; ChiP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; Si, small interference RNA; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; EMSA, electromobility shift assay; oligo, oligonucleotide; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; CBP, CREB-binding protein; AP-1, activator protein-1. protein and the mouse Y box-binding protein-1 (MSY-1) bind the Glut 3 promoter region and activate GLUT 3 expression in neurons. We speculate that although Sp1/Sp3 along with MSY-1 may regulate the transcriptional activation of GLUT 3 during neuro-development, trans-activation of GLUT 3 expression by pCREB may mediate the processes of neuronal synaptic activity and neuro-protection under conditions of substrate deficiency.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESOligonucleotides—Synthetic oligonucleotides (Invitrogen) were used in these experiments (nucleotides altered in mutant oligonucleotides are indicated by boldface type). Double-stranded oligonucleotides were generated by annealing the synthetic oligonucleotides with respective complementary sequences.Animals—Balb/c mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and housed in cages. The protocol for the care and use of animals was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Magee Womens Research Institute in accordance with the guidelines set by the National Institutes of Health. Mice were allowed access to laboratory chow and water ad libitum and were maintained in 12-h light-dark cycles.Cells—N2A murine neuroblastoma cells (American Tissue Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown at 37 °C with 95% air, 5% CO2 in poly-l-lysine-coated culture flasks and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 units/ml), and 10% fetal bovine serum (23Rajakumar R.A.

The extracted RNA was subjected to Northern blot analysis as described previously (23Rajakumar R.A. Thamotharan S. Menon R.K. Devaskar S.U. J. Biol.

Devaskar S.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27474-27483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The primary antibody consisted of an affinity-purified rabbit anti-mouse GLUT 3 IgG that was generated against a keyhole limpet-linked terminal 17 amino acids of the mouse GLUT 3 protein and the isoform specificity previously characterized by us (23Rajakumar R.A.

The primary anti-mouse GLUT 3 antibody was used at a 1:500 dilution, and the incubation with filters containing the transferred proteins was carried out at room temperature for 16 h. To detect nuclear proteins, the rabbit anti-synthetic human Sp1 peptide (436-454 amino acid region), anti-synthetic human Sp3 peptide (676-695 amino acids at the C-terminal region) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-rat CREB (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), and anti-mouse c-Jun (247-263 amino acids) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) antibodies were employed. Antibodies raised in rabbit against the MSY-1 peptide sequence NH2-DPPAENSSAPEAEQGGAECOOH (28Schwartzbauer G. Yu J.H. Cheng H. Menon R.K. J. Biol.

In certain instances 125I-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (50,000 cpm/sample, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used to detect the primary antigen-antibody complex. Autoradiography of the filters was carried out for optimal lengths of time to maintain linearity of the signal. Detection of protein bands for MSY-1 was carried out by subjecting the immunoblots to the chemiluminescent method (Amersham Biosciences) of detection.Primer Extension Assay—Primer extension was carried out as described previously (23Rajakumar R.A. Thamotharan S. Menon R.K. Devaskar S.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27474-27483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, an antisense oligonucleotide (Cruachem Inc., Dulles, VA) complementary to the +299 to +320 bp of the murine GLUT 3 mRNA (CTTCGTTGTCCCCATGGTCCCA) was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (DuPont). ∼5 × 106 cpm (50 fmol) of the labeled oligonucleotide and 5 μg of poly(A+) mRNA were mixed in 1 μl of the hybridization buffer (80% formamide, 0.4 m NaCl, 40 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, and 1 mm EDTA) and incubated for 10 min at 95 °C. Hybridization between the mRNA and labeled oligonucleotide was accomplished for 16 h at 42 °C. Reverse transcription was initiated by adding 30 units of avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI) to the mRNA/oligonucleotide mixture in 20 μl of a mixture consisting of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 6 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 10 units of RNasin, 0.625 mm dNTPs, and the reaction was carried out at 42 °C for 1 h. The primer-extended products were purified using Jetsorb (Genomed Inc., Research Triangle Park, NC) and separated on 8% polyacrylamide gels.RNase Protection Assay—A 341-bp fragment spanning -203 to +237 bp of the mouse Glut 3 gene was amplified by PCR and cloned into pGEM3z(f). 32P-Labeled antisense RNA probe was synthesized by the Sp6 polymerase using a riboprobe kit (Promega, Madison, WI). About 50,000 cpm (∼0.5 fmol) of gel-purified riboprobe was hybridized overnight at 45 °C with 5 μg of mRNA from the 21-day-old mouse brain in a hybridization buffer containing 80% formamide, 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.4, 300 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.4, and 1 mm EDTA. The hybrid was digested with 200 μl of a 1:50 dilution of RNase A (250 units/ml) and RNase T1 (10,000 units/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C prior to analysis on a 5% polyacrylamide gel.Transient Transfection and Reporter Expression Assays—A ∼1.8-kb fragment of the mouse GLUT 3 spanning the -1553- to +237-bp region was amplified by PCR and cloned into an enhancerless and promoterless firefly luciferase reporter gene containing vector (pGL2-basic: Promega, Madison, WI). Subsequently, serial 5′-deletional mouse GLUT 3-Luc fusion gene constructs were created by using a PCR-based strategy employing primers listed in Table I. The sequence and orientation of the individual clones were confirmed by direct DNA sequencing.

Briefly, 5 μg of the pGL2 fusion constructs were incubated at room temperature for 30 min with Lipofectin (25 μl) and 200 μl of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After thorough washing with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, the cells were exposed to this preincubated DNA-Lipofectin complex. pRL-Tk plasmid DNA (thymidine kinase promoter-driven Renilla luciferase, 0.5 μg (Promega, Madison, WI)) was cotransfected with each individual transfectant to standardize the results for transfection efficiency.The luciferase reporter activity was assessed by the dual luciferase assay (Promega, Madison, WI). Briefly, 36-48 h of post-transfection the cells were washed with PBS and lysed using 0.5 ml of passive lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). The supernatant on centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min was stored at -70 °C until analysis. Twenty μl of this cellular extract was mixed with 100 μl of the luciferase assay buffer, and the firefly luciferase activity was measured as light output (15 s) in a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence, San Diego, CA) (23Rajakumar R.A. Thamotharan S. Menon R.K. Devaskar S.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27474-27483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Subsequently the Renilla luciferase activity was estimated after the addition of 100 μl of the Stop and Glo reagent, and the light output (15 s) was measured separately. The Renilla-driven luciferase activity was used to standardize the Glut 3 promoter-driven firefly luciferase activity for transfection efficiency. The corrected Glut 3 promoter-driven luciferase activity was expressed as a percentage of the SV40 promoter-driven luciferase activity that served as the positive control in every transfection experiment.Small Interference (Si) RNA Transfection Experiments—SiRNA was constructed to target the mouse CREB (Dharmacom Inc., Dallas, TX) sequence between the +810- to +830-bp coding region by using the following oligonucleotides: sense, 5′-GAGAGAGGUCCGUCUAAUGUU-3′, and antisense, 5′-CAUUAGACGGACCUCUCUCUU-3′ (29Yang E.J. Yoon J.H. Chung K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1827-1837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Complementary oligonucleotides were converted to a 2′-hydroxyl annealed and desalted duplex strands with a 9-base spacer, thereby creating a short hairpin RNA that was driven by the RNA polymerase III promoter followed by a (T)5 RNA poly III transcriptional stop signal. Co-transfections into N2A cells were performed by using the -203-bp GLUT3-luciferase DNA construct (2 μg) and the constructed SiRNA targeted at CREB (100 nm) in 6-well plates using Trans-It-LTI and Trans-IT-TKO (Mirus Corp., Madison, WI) as transfection reagents, respectively (29Yang E.J.

Metab. 2003; 80: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). PGL2 basic consisting of the firefly luciferase as the reporter in the absence of a promoter region was used as a negative control. To assess the transfection efficiency, 0.25 μg of pRL-TK plasmid DNA (thymidine kinase promoter-driven Renilla luciferase; Promega, Madison, WI) was co-transfected as well. Luciferase activity was measured in 10 μl of the N2A cellular extract (Zylux FB 15 tube luminometer, Fisher) at 48 h post-transfection by the dual luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). In addition, 30 μg of protein from SiRNA-transfected N2A cell lysates was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the separated proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Each nitrocellulose membrane was washed twice for 10 min in distilled water. The membranes were then blocked by incubating with freshly prepared 5% bovine milk solution in PBS for 1 h at room temperature under constant agitation. The membranes were then washed with distilled H2O and incubated with 1:1000 dilution of the anti-CREB (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) antibody that was diluted in PBS containing 1% bovine milk solution. The incubation with primary antibody was conducted overnight with constant agitation at 4 °C, washed twice with distilled H2O, and incubated with the secondary antibody that was the anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG (Sigma) diluted in a PBS, 1% milk solution for 1.5 h at room temperature with agitation. The nitrocellulose membranes were washed twice with diluted H2O, followed by a wash in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 for 5 min, and rinsed twice in distilled H2O. Detection of protein bands for CREB was carried out by subjecting the immunoblots to the chemiluminescent method (Amersham Biosciences) of detection and then exposing them to x-ray film. Autoradiography of the filters was carried out for optimal lengths of time to maintain linearity of the signal (31Zovein A. Flowers-Ziegler J. Thamotharan S. Shin D. Sankar R. Nguyen K. Gambhir S.

Briefly, brain tissue was obtained, or 5 × 108 cells were retrieved by a rubber policeman and suspended in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 25% glycerol to extract the nuclear proteins. The extracted nuclear proteins were collected as the supernatant after centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 30 min and precipitated with solid (NH4)2SO4 by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min, and the supernatant was stored in aliquots at -70 °C. The concentration of the solubilized nuclear protein was measured by the method of Bradford (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar), and the concentration was adjusted to 1 mg/ml.Synthesized double-stranded oligonucleotides using the primers listed in Table II were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Approximately 6 fmol of the labeled DNA oligoprobe was added to 5 μg of nuclear extract in a final volume of 20 μl containing 1 μg of poly(dl-dC), 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 4% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the DNA-protein complexes were separated from the unbound DNA by electrophoresis through a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in a 90 mm Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA buffer (23Rajakumar R.A. Thamotharan S. Menon R.K. Devaskar S.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27474-27483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography in the presence of intensifying screens (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at -80 °C. Competition experiments included the addition of 10-1000-fold excess of unlabeled DNA oligonucleotides, whereas supershift analysis included the addition of 2 μg of the respective antibody to the reaction mix for 15 min.Table IIPrimers for gel-shift analysisPrimers used for gel-shift analysis− 195 to − 1735′ -AGCAGCACTGACTCTACTCTGCG-sense− 173 to − 1955′ -CGCAGAGTAGAGTCAGTGCTGCT-antisense− 144 to − 1195′ -CAAATTTGCCCGCCCTCCAAACTTG-sense− 119 to − 1445′ -CAAGTTTGGAGGGCGGGCAAATTTG-antisenseMutated primers used for gel-shift analysis− 195 to − 1735′ -AGCAGCACTGAAAAAACTCTGCG-sense− 173 to − 1955′ -CGCAGAGTTTTTTCAGTGCTGCT-antisense− 149 to − 1235′ -GCCTTCAAATTTGCTTGCTTTCCAAAC-sense− 123 to − 1495′ -GTTTGGAAAGCAAGCAAATTTGAAGGC-antisense Open table in a new tab Oligo-affinity Purification of MSY-1—In order to determine more precisely where MSY-1 binds within the -89 to -66 region on the Glut 3 promoter, MSY-1 was isolated from N2A nuclear extracts by using biotinylated oligonucleotides linked to streptavidin paramagnetic beads (32Kelm Jr., R.J.

Oligonucleotides corresponding to portions of the mouse GLUT 3 sense and antisense sequence between -90 and -61 bp were biotinylated at either the 5′ or 3′ ends. Oligo 177, 5′-GAAAAGGGGAAGGAA-biotin-3′, corresponded to the sense strand from -75 to -61 bp. Oligo 178, 5′-biotin-TTCCTTCCCCTTTTC-3′ corresponded to the antisense strand between -61 and -75 bp. Oligo 179, 5′-biotin-AGGCTGTCGGCTCTT-3′, corresponded to the sense strand between -90 and -76 bp, and oligo 180, 5′-AAGAGCCGACAGCCT-biotin-3′, corresponded to the antisense strand between -76 and -90 bp. In separate 500-μl reactions, 100 μg of N2A nuclear protein was mixed with 100 pmol of biotinylated oligonucleotide plus 50 μg of poly(dA) in EMSA binding buffer and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The protein bound to the biotinylated oligo was then purified by using streptavidin-conjugated paramagnetic beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Dynal Inc., Lake Success, NY). The bound protein was eluted by resuspending the beads in 40 μl of Laemmli buffer, incubating for 3 min at 65 °C, then adding 2 μl of 14.3 m β-mercaptoethanol, and heating for 5 min at 90 °C. The eluted protein was then analyzed by Western blot analysis by probing with antibodies against MSY-1.Identification of MSY-1 as a Glut 3 Promoter Binding Protein by Shift-Western Analysis—Because the MSY-1 antibody available for the current studies did not supershift MSY-1 protein when complexed with single-stranded DNA (data not shown), the presence of MSY-1 in the protein-DNA complex was ascertained by the shift-Western technique (28Schwartzbauer G.

Briefly, following a preparative electromobility shift analysis, the location of the DNA-protein complex was determined by using a PhosphorImager. The portion of the gel containing the shifted band was excised and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) and subjected to Western blot analysis using the antibody raised against MSY-1 (28Schwartzbauer G.

https://openalex.org/W2089442446,"Gating modifiers constitute a large group of polypeptide toxins that interact with the voltage-sensing module of ion channels. Among them, scorpion beta-toxins induce a negative shift in the voltage dependence of sodium channel activation. To explain their effect, a ""voltage sensor trapping"" model has been proposed in which the voltage sensor of domain-II (DIIS4) is trapped in an outward, activated position by a prebound beta-toxin upon membrane depolarization. Whereas toxin effect on channel activation was enhanced upon neutralization of the two outermost arginines in DIIS4, toxin residues involved in sensor trapping have not been identified. Using the scorpion excitatory beta-toxin, Bj-xtrIT, we found two conserved acidic residues, Glu15 and Glu30, mandatory for toxin action. Whereas mutagenesis of Glu30 affected both toxicity and binding affinity, substitutions E15A/F abolished activity but had minor effects on binding. Complete uncoupling of activity from binding was obtained with mutant E15R, acting as an efficient antagonist of Bj-xtrIT. On the basis of the voltage sensor trapping model and our results, we propose that Glu15 interacts with the emerging gating charges of DIIS4 upon membrane depolarization. Conserved acidic residues found in a variety of gating modifiers from scorpions and spiders may interact similarly with the voltage sensor."

Comparison of the structure with that obtained for OHRP from Pseudomonas aeruginosa reveals that the polypeptide chain of OHRPs can adopt two significantly different conformations (“in” and “out”) in the region of the active site disulfide moiety. It is postulated that the closed configuration is consistent with efficient catalysis of the reduction of organic hydroperoxides, whereas the open form is required for enzyme recycling.

The peculiar characteristics of DEIRA have made it the subject of intensive investigation, with DEIRA strain R1 being among the first organisms for which the complete genome sequence was made available (4White O. Eisen J.A. Heidelberg J.F. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Dodson R.J. Haft D.H. Gwinn M.L. Nelson W.C. Richardson D.L. Moffat K.S. Qin H. Jiang L. Pamphile W. Crosby M. Shen M. Vamathevan J.J. Lam P.

The extraordinary capability of DEIRA to repair double-stranded DNA breaks, which is perhaps linked to a unique packaging of DNA in cells of DEIRA, most likely lies at the heart of the bacterium's ability to recover from exposure to very high doses of radiation (1Minton K.W.

However, its genome also contains myriad genes that code for proteins that defend cells against the reactive oxygen species that occur under conditions of oxidative stress, and it may be possible that this prevention of DNA damage caused by reactive oxygen species may also play a role in the extremophile nature of the bacterium. Reactive oxygen species include the hydroxyl radical (OH·), the superoxide radical (O2⋅¯), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and organic hydroperoxides (OHPs). Peroxiredoxins (Prxs) are thiol-dependent peroxidases, widespread in nature, that carry out the cellular detoxification of the latter two species (7Wood Z.A. Schröder E. Harris R.J. Poole L.B.

This family of enzymes includes the alkyl hydroperoxide reductase C22 (AhpC), recently shown to be the primary scavenger of endogenous H2O2 in Escherichia coli. These enzymes accomplish detoxification by catalyzing the reduction of hydroperoxides to their corresponding alcohols using redox-active cysteines. In the mechanism for this reaction, one redox-active cysteine, called the peroxidatic cysteine (CP), attacks the substrate and is converted to a cysteine-sulfenic acid. This acid is then attacked by the so-called resolving cysteine (CR), resulting in the formation of a disulfide bond that must be re-reduced to reproduce the active enzyme Recently, a gene family that complements the Prx system has been discovered (14Mongkolsuk S. Praituan W. Loprasert S. Fuangthong M. Chamnongpol S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2636-2643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This gene has been named the organic hydroperoxide resistance gene (Ohr), because its deletion in Xanthomonas campestris pv. phaseoli sensitizes this organism to organic hydroperoxides (mainly t-butylhydroperoxide and cumene hydroperoxide) but not to hydrogen peroxide or super-oxides. The organic hydroperoxide resistance proteins (OHRPs) encoded by Ohr genes are generally 140 amino acids in length. They have high sequence homology with other members of the family (Fig. 1), are biologically active as homodimers (15Lesniak J. Barton W.A. Nikolov D.B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6649-6659Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 16Rosa Cussiol J.R. Alves S.V. de Oliveira M.A. Netto L.E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11570-11578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and contain two absolutely conserved cysteines in the polypeptide chain. The conserved cysteine occurring at around position 60 in the amino acid sequence is found in a very strictly conserved ACF motif at the end of a highly conserved stretch of ∼16 amino acids. The conserved cysteine near amino acid position 121 is usually found in a VCPY motif embedded in a highly conserved chain of 12 residues (see Fig. 1). The environments of the two strictly conserved cysteine residues suggests that OHRPs function as a new type of 2Cys-Prx protein, and strong evidence, both biochemical (15Lesniak J. Barton W.A. Nikolov D.B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6649-6659Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 16Rosa Cussiol J.R. Alves S.V. de Oliveira M.A. Netto L.E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11570-11578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and structural (15Lesniak J. Barton W.A. Nikolov D.B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6649-6659Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), has emerged to support this hypothesis. From the available evidence, it is also clear that the two conserved cysteines form an intramolecular redox-active disulfide, with CP found toward the beginning of the amino acid sequence, and that the reaction catalyzed by OHRPs is 2RSH + ROOH → RSSR + ROH +H2O. The amino acid sequences of OHRPs also contain two absolutely conserved arginine residues near positions 15 and 128, and both biochemical and structural evidence (15Lesniak J. Barton W.A. Nikolov D.B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6649-6659Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) suggests that the former of these plays a crucial role in the enzymatic mechanism of OHRPs. The exact nature of the reducing equivalent required for recycling of the disulfide is not yet clear. However, the peroxidase activity of OHRP from X. fastidiosa appears to be supported only in the presence of dithiol-containing reducing agents such as dithiothreitol (DTT) or dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA). Indeed, biochemical evidence suggests that OHRPs may actually be DHLA peroxidases (16Rosa Cussiol J.R. Alves S.V. de Oliveira M.A. Netto L.E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11570-11578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Ohr genes are related to those of the OsmC family, with sequence identities of ∼30% (17Atichartpongkul S. Loprasert S. Vattanaviboon P. Whangsuk W. Helmann J.D. Mongkolsuk S. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 1775-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). OsmC family proteins also contain two absolutely conserved cysteines (near positions 55 and 120 in the polypeptide chain), and the environments of these cysteines (particularly the N-terminal one) (Fig. 1) are very similar to those found in OHRPs. It might thus be expected that OHRPs and OsmCs have similar structures and functions. However, it is unclear as to whether this really is the case, given the results of two recent contradictory reports. The first of these notes the increased sensitivity of OsmC mutants of E. coli to t-butylhydroperoxide, suggesting that there are similar structures and functions for the two proteins (18Conter A. Gangneux C. Suzanne M. Gutierrez C. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The second (17Atichartpongkul S. Loprasert S. Vattanaviboon P. Whangsuk W. Helmann J.D. Mongkolsuk S. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 1775-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) reports that similar mutants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa show increased sensitivity only to osmotic stress (high salt concentration) and ethanol, and it suggests different functions for OHRPs and OsmCs. The gene DR1857 encodes a 14.5-KDa (139 amino acids) protein (OHRPDr) that has been annotated as a member of the OHRP family (Fig. 1) and predicted to be highly expressed by DEIRA (19Karlin S. Mrázek J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5240-5245Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). As part of a structural genomics project focusing on gene products that may be important in contributing to the extremophile nature of DEIRA strain R1, we now report the three-dimensional structure of OHRPDr as determined using single-crystal x-ray diffraction techniques. The structure, when compared with that recently obtained for OHRP from P. aeruginosa (OHRPPa), allows a description of conformational differences between the OHRPs in their redox-active site reduced and oxidized forms. This provides an explanation of how the enzyme might be recycled once neutralization of organic hydroperoxides is achieved. We also compare the structure of OHRPDr to that recently reported for OsmC from Mycoplasma pneumoniae (OSMCMp) and comment on the structural and possible functional similarities of the two protein families. Cloning, expression, and purification of wild-type OHRPDr modified by the addition of an N-terminal hexahistidine tag was accomplished as described elsewhere (20Meunier-Jamin C. Kapp U. Leonard G.A. McSweeney S.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 920-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The selenomethionine (SeMet)-substituted protein, the structure of which is described here, was then produced using established protocols (21Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar) and purified in a similar manner, with the exception that 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol was added to the buffers used in the procedure. The pure protein fraction used for crystallization was then dialyzed against a storage buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 200 mm NaCl, and 5 mm DTT and then concentrated to 10 mg/ml and stored at -20 °C. Electrospray mass spectrometry confirmed the complete substitution of Met by SeMet Crystals of the SeMet-substituted protein appeared after several days from hanging drops containing 2 μl of the protein stock solution and 2 μl of a reservoir solution comprising 31-35% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 0.2 m MgCl2, and 0 or 2% (v/v) glycerol. The drops were equilibrated at 20 °C against 1 ml of the reservoir solution. Structure solution was carried out using the single-wave-length anomalous diffraction (SAD) technique (22Dauter Z. Dauter M. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 494-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). X-ray diffraction data from a single crystal of the SeMet protein (Table I) were collected at 100 K, and λ = 0.933 Å on the beamline ID14-EH2 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The same contiguous 180° segment of data was measured twice using 0.5° oscillation images and, initially, integrated to the limit of the inscribed circle on the ADSC Q4 detector (dmin = 2.3 Å) using the program MOSFLM. The data were then scaled and merged using SCALA, and the structure factors and anomalous differences were obtained by using the program TRUNCATE. This data set was used for both selenium atom substructure determination and initial phase calculations. A second data set was then derived, this time integrating diffraction spots over the entire area of the detector only for the first 180° of data collected. This data set includes reflections to a resolution of 1.9 Å and was used in both the automatic model building and refinement procedures outlined below. The data scaling and merging procedure clearly showed the crystals to be monoclinic, with cell dimensions of a = 45.41, b = 56.60, c = 49.46 Å, and β = 90.27°, and an examination of systematic absences in the intensity data indicated the space group to be P21.

Open table in a new tab Initial determination of the positions of the selenium atoms in the crystal was then carried out with anomalous difference data using direct methods as implemented in the program SHELXD (23Sheldrick G.M. SHELXS 86: Program for Crystal Structure Solution. University of Gottingen, Germany1986Google Scholar, 24Sheldrick G.M. Fortier S. Direct Methods for Solving Macromolecular Structures. Kluwer Academic Press, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1998: 401-411Crossref Google Scholar). The best solution resulted in a (Eobs, Ecalc) correlation coefficient of 27.1 for all of the reflections used in the search procedure and clearly indicated that the asymmetric unit contains the four selenium sites expected for the presence of a dimer in the asymmetric unit. Once it was clear that the selenium atom substructure could be found readily, the programs SHARP/AutoSharp (25de la Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar) were used for phase determination to dmin = 2.3 Å. These initial phases were then extended to the 1.9-Å resolution of the second data set described above by using solvent flattening, histogram matching, and non-crystallographic symmetry averaging in the program DM. In the first round of the averaging procedure, the initial averaging matrices were found using the program GETAX as implemented in AutoSharp, and an averaging mask was determined automatically. The phases resulting from this procedure allowed the building of a substantial part of the structure automatically using Arp/Warp (26Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar), and this structure was used as a basis for improving the non-crystallographic symmetry matrix and building a more suitable averaging mask. Using these, the phase extension procedure was repeated, and the subsequent run of Arp/Warp allowed the building of the main chain of 244 residues in nine separate chains, giving a connectivity index of 0.93. A more complete model was then built using the program O (27Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar), and this model provided the basis for a refinement protocol using the program REFMAC5 interspersed with rounds of manual rebuilding, during which further residues were added to the model, and water and glycerol moieties were included. Statistics showing the results of this refinement protocol are presented in Table I. Unless referenced specifically, all of the programs that were used during the data collection, structure determination, and refinement procedures are from the CCP4 package (28Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Structure of OHRPDr—The structure of OHRPDr, as presented in our crystal form (Fig. 2), is very similar to that reported recently for OHRPPa (15Lesniak J. Barton W.A. Nikolov D.B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6649-6659Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), with which OHRPDr shares 51% amino acid sequence identity. As is the case with the structure of OHRPDr, the asymmetric unit of OHRPPa contains the biologically active homodimer. A superposition of the structures of OHRPDr and OHRPPa aligns them with a 1.14-Å root mean square deviation for 267 common Cα atoms in the dimer (Fig. 3). The structure of each OHRPDr monomer comprises two distinct subdomains. The N-terminal domain is small (residues 1-35) and consists of β-strands β1-β3 (see Fig. 1 for secondary structure assignment) folded into a β-sheet. In the larger (residues 47-139) C-terminal domain, helices α1 and α2 (the latter severely kinked) are stacked on a β-sheet formed by strands β4-β6. To form the functionally active homodimer, α1 from one monomer is inserted between the N- and C-terminal domains of the second subunit and vice versa. This results in an elliptically shaped β-α-α-β sandwich structure in which the N termini of both α1 helices and the C termini of the α2 helices are stacked between a pair of six-stranded, concave β-sheets. In both monomers, the sulfur atoms of the conserved cysteine residues are found adjacent to each other, with CP situated near the midpoint of α1 and the resolving cysteine at the kinking point of α2.Fig. 3Comparison of the structures of OHRPDr and OHRPPa. A stereo pair showing the superposition of the structures of OHRPDr (red) and OHRPPa (blue) is shown. Also shown as green sticks is the side chain of Arg-18 in the structure of OHRPPa. Note how this side chain approaches close to the redox active disulfide, where it plays an important role in the catalysis of the reduction of organic peroxides. The modified conformation of the polypeptide backbone in this region in the structure of OHRPDr means that this conserved arginine can no longer point in the same direction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Comparison of the Structures of OHRPDr and OHRPPa—Despite the global similarities of the structures of OHRPDr and OHRPPa, they differ in two noteworthy respects. The first of these differences concerns the conformation of the disulfides in the active sites. In both OHRPDr and OHRPPa, CP and the resolving cysteine (Cys57 and Cys121, OHRPDr numbering) are found in the same polypeptide chain, and the two redox-active disulfides are located on opposite sides of the dimer close to monomer-monomer interfaces. In the structure of OHRPPa, the disulfide groups are clearly in the reduced (SγH-HγS) state. In OHRPDr, the Sγ57-Sγ121 distance is 2.8 Å in both active sites in the dimer. These distances are thus intermediate between the 2.2 Å that is expected for a fully oxidized disulfide bond and the 3.7 Å that one might expect for a fully reduced disulfide. Although a reducing agent (DTT) was added to the buffer in which the SeMet protein was stored, it is well documented that its efficacy drops off over time (see Refs. 29Weichsel A. Gasdaska J.R. Powis G. Montfort W.R. Structure. 1996; 4: 735-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar and 30Hofmann B. Budde H. Bruns K. Guerrero S.A. Kalisz H.M. Menge U. Montemartini M. Nogoceke E. Steinert P. Wissing J.B. Flohé L. Hecht H.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar for examples of this). Thus, because DTT was not present in the reservoir solution used in the crystallization procedure, it is very likely that the crystal used here for data collection originally contained, in the large majority, molecules of OHRPDr in its oxidized (Sγ-Sγ) form. One explanation of the intermediate S-S distances observed is that they are the time- and space-averaged results of a mixture of oxidized and reduced disulfides. However, the electron density in the crystal (Fig. 4) suggests that there is only a single major conformation for the disulfides. Thus, a more plausible reason for S-S distances observed in the structure of OHRPDr is that they are the result of the photoreduction of the S-S bond due to x-ray irradiation during data collection. This phenomenon is more commonly known as radiation damage (31Burmeister W.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 328-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 32Ravelli R.G.B. McSweeney S.M.

Synchrotron Rad. 2002; 9 (2003): 342-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The S-S distances that we observed in the structure of OHRPDr are almost exactly that calculated theoretically for disulfide radical anions (RS-SR.) (35Bergès J. Fuster F. Jacquot J-P. Silvi B. Houée-Levin C. Nucleonika. 2000; 45: 23-30Google Scholar), and the disulfide bonds, although weakened, are not broken. The structure of OHRPDr that we report here is thus representative of that for an OHRP in its oxidized (i.e. disulfide bond-containing) form. It should be noted, however, that the difference electron density (mFobs - DFcalc, αcalc) maps (Fig. 4), which were calculated at the end of the refinement procedure, show features close to the disulfide groups that suggest the presence of an additional low occupancy conformation for the disulfides. A positive peak in the difference density clearly shows this conformation to be a more open configuration of the redox disulfide and suggests that the crystal also contains a small percentage of molecules with an open disulfide bond. The second major difference between the crystal structures of OHRPPa and OHRPDr is the fact that the loop containing an arginine residue (Arg-18 in the sequence of OHRPPa and Arg-15 in that of OHRPDr) conserved in the sequences of all bacterial OHRPs adopts quite different conformations. In the crystal structure of OHRPPa (blue in Fig. 3), the loop from subunit B is closed in and points toward the subunit A active site disulfide and vice versa. The side chain of the arginine forms an inter-subunit salt bridge with a glutamic acid residue conserved in the sequences of both OHRPs and OsmCs (Glu-50 in OHRPPa) and approaches to within 3.4 Å of the Sγ of CP. Lesniak and colleagues (15Lesniak J. Barton W.A. Nikolov D.B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6649-6659Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) have reported that an R18Q mutant of OHRPPa possesses a substantially compromised ability to metabolize hydroperoxides. The mechanism that they therefore propose for peroxide reduction by OHRPs (15Lesniak J. Barton W.A. Nikolov D.B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6649-6659Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) is essentially that of other 2Cys-peroxiredoxins (7Wood Z.A. Schröder E. Harris R.J. Poole L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2136) Google Scholar), as the conformation of the arginine-containing loop in the structure of OHRPPa places this conserved residue in an ideal position to stabilize the ionized peroxidatic cysteine that attacks the peroxide. This mechanism also neatly explains why OHRPs are biologically active as homodimers. Based on sequence alignments (Fig. 1), it is highly probable that Arg-15 in OHRPDr plays the same crucial role in the stabilization of CP as does Arg-18 in OHRPPa. However, in both subunits in the crystal structure of OHRPDr, the loop containing Arg-15 has flipped away from the catalytic disulfide (Fig. 3). Additionally, because the electron density for the side chain of the arginine residue is no longer visible (this residue has been truncated at the Cβ atom in both monomers of OHRPDr), it must therefore be directed toward the solvent region in the crystals. It is thus clear that, in OHRPs, this loop can adopt two significantly different conformations (“in” and “out”). In contrast to the structure of OHRPPa, our crystal contains molecules of OHRP that are not fully reduced. It thus seems reasonable to suggest that the in conformation of the loop occurs when the active site disulfide is open (i.e. reduced) and that the out conformation occurs when it is closed (i.e. oxidized). Wood and colleagues noted (36Wood Z.A. Poole L.B. Karplus A.P. Science. 2003; 300: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar) that the 2Cys-Prxs they investigated also have two stable conformations that appear to be correlated with the catalytic cycle. Those conformations that contain a reduced disulfide are found with what is termed a “fully folded” conformation, whereas for those conformations in which a disulfide bond formation is observed, there is a local unfolding of the protein molecule close to the active site. The in and out conformations observed for OHRPs would appear to be analogous to these conformations, and it is probable that, in vivo, the arginine-containing loop in OHRPs acts a lid that closes when the redox disulfide is in its reduced, active form and opens when the disulfide is oxidized. In the fully folded (i.e. reduce"

To identify VSMC proteins that interact with PKGI, the N-terminal protein interaction domain of PKGIα was used to screen a yeast two-hybrid human aortic cDNA library. The formin homology (FH) domain-containing protein, FHOD1, was found to interact with PKGIα in this screen. FH domain-containing proteins bind Rho-family GTPases and regulate actin cytoskeletal dynamics, cell migration, and gene expression. Antisera to FHOD1 were raised and used to characterize FHOD1 expression and distribution in vascular cells. FHOD1 is highly expressed in human coronary artery, aortic smooth muscle cells, and in human arterial and venous endothelial cells. In glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments, the FHOD1 C terminus (amino acids 964–1165) binds full-length PKGI. Both in vitro and intact cell studies demonstrate that the interaction between FHOD1 and PKGI is decreased 3- to 5-fold in the presence of the PKG activator, 8Br-cGMP. Immunofluorescence studies of human VSMC show that FHOD1 is cytoplasmic and is concentrated in the perinuclear region. PKGI also directly phosphorylates FHOD1, and studies with wild-type and mutant FHOD1-derived peptides identify Ser-1131 in the FHOD1 C terminus as the unique PKGI phosphorylation site in FHOD1. These studies demonstrate that FHOD1 is a PKGI-interacting protein and substrate in VSMCs and show that cyclic GMP negatively regulates the FHOD1-PKGI interaction. Based on the known functions of FHOD1, the data are consistent with a role for FHOD1 in cyclic GMP-dependent inhibition of VSMC stress fiber formation and/or migration.

Protein ubiquitination is the type of post-translational modification in which a highly conserved 76-amino acid polypeptide, ubiquitin, is attached to proteins. A cascade of three enzymes mediates this process, the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and the E3 ubiquitin ligase. E1 activates ubiquitin by generating a high energy E1-thiol ester-ubquitin intermediate. E2s transfer the activated ubiquitin to the cysteine residue on E3 before conjugating ubiquitin to the target proteins (20Hartmann-Petersen R. Seeger M. Gordon C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 26-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin E3 ligase plays a vital role in substrate recognition specificity and subsequent protein degradation by the 26 S proteasome, which is a large multisubunit proteolytic complex. There are three major types of E3 ligase: homology to E6-AP carboxyl-terminal (HECT) domain E3s, RING finger motif-containing E3s, and E4/U box-containing proteins. HEF1 was found to be involved in the TGF-β signaling pathway. It was isolated as a Smad3-specific interactor in a yeast two-hybrid screen using Smad3 as bait (7Liu X. Elia A.E. Law S.F. Golemis E.A. Farley J. Wang T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6759-6769Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Further studies indicate that Smad3 interaction with HEF1 enhances HEF1 degradation in a proteasome-dependent fashion and that the activation of TGF-β signaling further enhances HEF1 degradation (7Liu X. Elia A.E. Law S.F. Golemis E.A. Farley J. Wang T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6759-6769Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In epithelial cell lines and a T lymphoid cell line (H9), HEF1 protein level was demonstrated to undergo rapid reduction in responding to TGF-β stimulation followed by a negative feedback-type increase of HEF1 mRNA (7Liu X. Elia A.E. Law S.F. Golemis E.A. Farley J. Wang T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6759-6769Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Zheng and McKeown-Longo (21Zheng M. McKeown-Longo P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39599-39608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) also reported that TGF-β and cell adhesion regulate HEF1 expression and phosphorylation in dermal fibroblasts, adding more evidence to the functional link between TGF-β signaling pathways and HEF1 protein expression. Such a link provides a new molecular mechanistic explanation for the ability of TGF-β to regulate myriad biological functions through cross-talk to many of the HEF1-involved signaling pathways. However, the exact nature of the TGF-β signaling events associated with HEF1 degradation is still not fully understood, and the detailed molecular mechanisms of HEF1 degradation also need to be uncovered. Here we report the biochemical studies of the physical and functional interaction between HEF1 and atrophin-1-interacting protein 4 (AIP4), which is the human homolog of the mice Itch protein (hItch) (22Perry W.L.

Lack of the Itch protein in non-agouti mice contributes to the autoimmune phenotypes of the Itch mice (22Perry W.L. Hustad C.M. Swing D.A. O'Sullivan T.N. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). AIP4 was originally cloned as an interactor of atrophin-1, the protein implicated in the neurodegenerative disease dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy (25Margolis R.L. Li S.H. Young W.S.

Its protein sequence suggests that it belongs to the C2-WW subfamily within the HECT domain-containing E3 ligase family. The C2-WW subfamily is characterized with a calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding domain (or C2 domain) at the NH2 terminus followed by 2-4 WW domains and then the COOH-terminal HECT domain. The HECT domain is a ∼350-residue region that harbors a strictly conserved cysteine residue that forms an essential thiol ester intermediate during catalysis at the COOH terminus. Two known C2-WW subfamily members are Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor 1 (Smurf1) and Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor 2 (Smurf2), both of which function as constitutive E3 ligases for the bone morphogenetic protein pathway-restricted Smads (Smad1 and Smad5) and TGF-β pathway-restricted Smads (Smad2 and Smad3), respectively (27Zhu H. Kavsak P. Abdollah S. Wrana J.L. Thomsen G.H. Nature. 1999; 400: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 28Bonni S. Wang H.R. Causing C.G. Kavsak P. Stroschein S.L. Luo K. Wrana J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In addition, Smurf2, when bound to Smad7, is recruited to the activated TGF-β receptors to form a complex in which Smurf2 ubiquitinates Smad7 (29Kavsak P. Rasmussen R.K. Causing C.G. Bonni S. Zhu H. Thomsen G.H. Wrana J.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1365-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). In response to TGF-β stimulation, Smurf2 can be recruited by Smad2/Smad3 to form a complex with and ubiquitinate SnoN (28Bonni S. Wang H.R. Causing C.G. Kavsak P. Stroschein S.L. Luo K. Wrana J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The later observation suggests that E3 ligases not only mediate the ubiquitination of Smads but also can be recruited by Smads to mediate the ubiquitination of Smad-interacting proteins. AIP4 was first isolated as an interactor of Smad3 but does not mediate the ubiquitination of Smad3. 2S. Guedes, J. Farley, X. Liu, and T. Wang, manuscript in preparation. Recently, it has been demonstrated that AIP4 does mediate the ubiquitination of atrophin-1 as well as the two scaffold proteins MAGI-1 and GAGI-2 that were previously shown to bind atrophin-1. 3J. D. Wood, Z. A. Keminsky, Y. Kim, S. Guedes, T. Wang, and C. A. Ross, submitted for publication. Since Smad3 interacts with HEF1 and regulates HEF1 degradation, we tested the possibility of AIP4 to be recruited by Smad3 to mediate the ubiquitination of HEF1. Our results show that AIP4 is an E3 ligase for HEF1 and, together with Smad3, regulates proteasomal degradation of HEF1. Antibodies and Reagents—Anti-Myc (9E10) and anti-HEF1 (N-17) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-p130cas monoclonal antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-T7 (69522-4) was purchased from Novagen. Anti-FLAG was obtained from Sigma, and anti-HA was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Nα-Benzyloxycarbonyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-leucinal (MG132) (c2211), N- acetyl-l-leucinyl-l-leucinal-l-norleucinal (LLnL) (A6185), phosphatase inhibitor (P5726), protease inhibitor mixture (P8340), and ubiquitin (U6253) were all purchased from Sigma. Cycloheximide (100183) was purchased from ICN Biomedicals Inc. MG132 and LLnL were dissolved in Me2SO and added directly into cell culture medium to a final concentration of 50 μm for 5 h before harvest. Constructs—The construction of full-length Myc-AIP4 has been described previously. 3J. D. Wood, Z. A. Keminsky, Y. Kim, S. Guedes, T. Wang, and C. A. Ross, submitted for publication. The pCMV-HEF1 expression vector has been described previously (8Law S.F. Zhang Y.Z. Klein-Szanto A.J.P. Golemis E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3540-3551Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). All of the other mammalian expression constructs for HEF1 were constructed in our laboratory previously (7Liu X. Elia A.E. Law S.F. Golemis E.A. Farley J. Wang T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6759-6769Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Smad3 and HEF1 were subcloned into EcoRI/XhoI sites, and AIP4 was suncloned with BamHI and NotI sites in pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Biosciences) using standard procedures (30.Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (1994) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, pp. 3.16, 9.1, and 10.8, New York, NYGoogle Scholar). Smad3 and HEF1 were subcloned into EcoRI/XhoI sites, and AIP4WT/CA were subcloned into SalI/NotI in pCS2+ vector containing a SP6 promoter for in vitro translation. Myc-Smurf1 and Myc-Smurf2 constructs were obtained from the laboratory of J. Wrana. The HA-Ub construct was a kind gift from Dr. M. Treier. Mammalian Cell Line—293 cells (human kidney cells transformed with adenovirus 5 DNA) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 25,000 units of penicillin, 25 mg of streptomycin, and 5 ml of 200 mm l-glutamine at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. Mink lung epithelial cells (Mv1Lu or ML) were cultured in the same medium and under the same conditions as description above except using active fetal bovine serum. Transfection—293 cells were transfected using the standard CaPO4 procedure (30.Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (1994) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, pp. 3.16, 9.1, and 10.8, New York, NYGoogle Scholar), and cells were harvested 24 h after transfection. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Cells were incubated 30 min on ice with Hepes-buffered saline-lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors just prior to use). Cell debris was pelleted by spinning in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, and supernatant was saved for immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were incubated with 2 μg of primary antibody for 2 h at 4 °C followed by an additional 2-h incubation with 40 μl of a 50% slurry of protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences). Beads were then washed once using lysis buffer and three times with modified lysis buffer (lysis buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100). The precipitated proteins were eluted in 2× SDS loading buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, and 20% glycerol) plus 10% β-mercaptoethanol, loaded on SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.). Membranes were analyzed by Western blot (30.Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (1994) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, pp. 3.16, 9.1, and 10.8, New York, NYGoogle Scholar). Antibodies were diluted as follows: α-HEF1 (1:1000), α-p130cas (1:1000), α-FLAG (1:4000), α-T7 (1:10,000), α-Myc (1:1000), α-HA (1:2000). GST Pull-down Assay—GST-AIP4 and GST-HEF1 were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli strain BL-21. Briefly, the culture was induced at OD ∼0.6 with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2-3 h. Cell were collected by spinning at 5,000 rpm at 4 °C for ∼15 min. The pellet was then resuspended in Prep buffer (100 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm EDTA, 2% Triton X-100) supplemented with 2 mm dithiothreitol and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysis occurred using 10 mg/ml lysozyme (catalog no. BP 535-1; Fisher) in Prep buffer for 30 min on ice, and debris was spun down by spinning 30 min at 4,000 × g at 4 °C. Cell lysates were then incubated with a 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C and washed three times with ice-cold PBS. About 4 μg of GST fusion proteins that were immobilized on beads were incubated with extracts in lysis buffer, washed three times with modified lysis buffer, and resuspended in SDS loading buffer. To test a direct protein-protein interaction, proteins were translated in vitro and 35S-labeled by using the TNT reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). The in vitro translated product (8 μl) was incubated with the GST beads in 200 μl of modified lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors and washed as previously described. Yeast Two-hybrid Tests—Protein-protein interaction tests using the yeast two-hybrid system were carried out as described before (7Liu X. Elia A.E. Law S.F. Golemis E.A. Farley J. Wang T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6759-6769Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, full-length HEF1 was subcloned into the bait construct pEG202 and fused in frame with the DNA binding domain LexA. AIP4 and its deletions were subcloned into the prey construct pJG4-5 and fused in frame with the transcriptional activation domain B42. Yeast strain EGY48 was transformed with the bait construct first and then transformed with the prey construct. The interaction was monitored on glucose plate and galactose plate supplemented with X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside). Protein Degradation Assays—Mink lung epithelial cell (Mv1 Lu or ML) extracts were made as described before (5Wan Y. Liu X. Kirschner M.W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1027-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Briefly, mink lung epithelial cells were cultured for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in 5% CO2. To stimulate cells with TGF-β, they were treated with 100 pm TGF-β (a gift from Anita Roberts). After 1 h, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by scraping. Approximately 1 × 108 harvested cells were resuspended in 500 μl of hypotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol), 1× protease mixture (Roche Applied Science), and an energy regeneration mixture (31Murray A.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 581-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar) for 30 min to allow cells to swell. Cells were frozen by liquid nitrogen, thawed in a 37 °C water bath, and homogenized with 10 strokes using a Dounce homogenizer. Cell lysates were spun in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 1 h. The clear supernatant was collected using a syringe needle and used directly for protein degradation assays. For protein degradation assays, ∼10 ng of 35S-labeled HEF1 synthesized in the TNT expression system and 8 ng of unlabeled in vitro translated Smad3 or AIP4CA or AIP4 were added to 20 μl of fresh Mv1Lu extracts supplemented with the degradation mixture (1.25 mg/ml ubiquitin, 1× energy regeneration, and 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide). Aliquots were removed at different times and resolved by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. AIP4 Interacts Directly with HEF1—Our previous studies have suggested that the Cas family multidomain docking protein HEF1 was subjected to rapid proteasomal degradation upon its interaction with the key signal transducer of the TGF-β pathway, Smad3. It was shown that the interaction between Smad3 and HEF1 via their amino-terminal domains is important for HEF1 degradation (7Liu X. Elia A.E. Law S.F. Golemis E.A. Farley J. Wang T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6759-6769Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear how Smad3 interaction with HEF1 can lead to HEF1 degradation by proteasome. The HECT family E3 ligase AIP4 was isolated together with HEF1 from the yeast two-hybrid system as a strong and specific interactor of Smad3 (7Liu X. Elia A.E. Law S.F. Golemis E.A. Farley J. Wang T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6759-6769Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Initially, we tested whether AIP4 is an E3 ligase for Smad3. However, unlike Smurf1 or Smurf2, AIP4 does not ubiquitinate Smad3. 2S. Guedes, J. Farley, X. Liu, and T. Wang, manuscript in preparation. Thus, we tested whether AIP4 mediates HEF1 ubiquitination by interacting with Smad3 and HEF1. The interaction between AIP4 and HEF1 was first tested in the yeast two-hybrid system. The full-length HEF1 was cloned into pEG202 to generate a LexA fusion protein. A truncated version of AIP4, AIP4Δ65, fused with the transcription activation domain B42, was obtained directly from the screen using Smad3 as bait. AIP4Δ65 contains four WW domains and part of HECT domain. After both constructs were made and transformed into the yeast, the transformants were selected on a glucose U-H-W- plate. The transformants were then spotted onto a galactose/raffinose-X-gal plate, which allows the tested clone to turn blue within 24 h if an interaction occurs between the two fusion proteins. The same transformants were also spotted onto a control plate of glucose/X-gal, which allows the tested clone to remain white due to the repression of the expression of the B42 fusion protein by glucose. As shown in Fig. 1A, the yeast clone containing LexA-HEF1 and B42-AIP4Δ65 turned strong blue on the galactose/raffinose X-gal plate but remained white on glucose X-gal plate, suggesting strong and specific interaction between these two proteins. To further confirm the interaction observed in the yeast two-hybrid system, we carried out the GST pull-down assays to test the interaction between HEF1 and AIP4 in vitro. FLAG-tagged Smad3 and Myc-tagged AIP4 were transiently expressed in the 293 cells respectively or together. Cell lysates were made and tested for the expression of both proteins (Fig. 1B, lanes 1-3) and incubated with GST bead-bound GST-HEF1 expressed and purified from E. coli BL21. After eluting the bound proteins from the beads, Western blot was performed to detect Myc-AIP4 and FLAG-Smad3 using anti-Myc antibody and anti-FLAG antibody, respectively (Fig. 1B, lanes 4-6). Both Myc-AIP4 and FLAG-Smad3, respectively, were found to bind HEF1 (Fig. 1B, lanes 4 and 5). When both Myc-AIP4 and FLAG-Smad3 were co-expressed, both proteins were detected to bind GST-HEF1 (Fig. 1B, lane 6). The FLAG-Smad3 band was even more intense than that detected when FLAG-Smad3 alone was incubated with GST-HEF1 (Fig. 1B, lane 6 compared with lane 5), suggesting that there is no competition between Smad3 and AIP4 to bind HEF1, but instead the interaction appears to be simultaneous or even cooperative. The specificity of such interactions was further tested by including HEF1 itself in the lysates (Fig. 1C). Excess of HEF1 expression together with FLAG-Smad3 and Myc-AIP4 totally blocked both of these proteins from binding to GST-HEF1 (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 5 and 6 with lanes 7 and 8). The above in vitro pull-down assay demonstrates that both AIP4 and Smad3 can form a complex, possibly a ternary complex with HEF1. We then tested via in vitro binding assay whether the interaction between AIP4 and HEF1 or between AIP4 and Smad3 is direct. 35S-labeled in vitro translated HEF1 or Smad3 proteins (Fig. 1D, lanes 1 and 2) were incubated with GST-AIP4 (Fig. 1D, lanes 3 and 4). GST alone was use as a negative control (lanes 5 and 6). 35S-Labeled Smad3 and HEF1 were found to bind GST-AIP4 (Fig. 1D, lanes 3 and 4). A separate study has shown that HEF1 interacts with Smad3 directly. 4Nourry, C., Maksumova, L., Liu, X., and Wang, T. (2004) BMC Cell Biol. 5, 20. These data pointed out that HEF1, AIP4, and Smad3 perform mutual direct interaction. Next we tested whether AIP4 and HEF1 interact in mammalian cells. Myc-tagged full-length AIP4 protein was transiently co-expressed with HEF1 protein in the 293 cells. HEF1 protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-p130cas antibody, and the co-precipitated Myc-tagged AIP4 was detected by Western blot using anti-Myc antibody. Myc-AIP4 was detected to co-precipitate with HEF1 (Fig. 1E, lane 4). A conserved cysteine residue in the HECT domain of AIP4 (C830) is considered to form an essential thiol ester intermediate during catalysis. To determine whether the ligase activity of AIP4 regulates the interaction, as shown to be the case for the Smurfs (27Zhu H. Kavsak P. Abdollah S. Wrana J.L. Thomsen G.H. Nature. 1999; 400: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar), we mutated this conserved cysteine and created the ligase-dead mutant AIP4 (C830A) and tested its interaction with HEF1. No change was detected; thus, the ligase activity of AIP4 does not affect AIP4 binding to HEF1 (Fig. 1E, lane 5). The very weak band of AIP4 detected in lane 3 most likely represents the small amount of Myc-AIP4 co-precipitated with the endogenous HEF1.

Genome sequencing of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster revealed the presence of three additional porin-like genes. No functional information was available for the different gene products. In this work we have studied the function of the gene product closest to the known Porin gene (CG17137 coding for DmPorin2). Its coding sequence was expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant DmPorin2 protein is able to form channels similar to those formed by DmPorin1 reconstituted in artificial membranes. Furthermore, DmPorin2 is clearly voltage-independent and cation-selective, whereas its counterpart isoform 1 is voltage-dependent and anion-selective. Sequence comparison of the two porin isoforms indicates the exchange of four lysines in DmPorin1 for four glutamic acids in DmPorin2. We have mutated two of them (Glu-66 and Glu-163) to lysines to investigate their role in the functional features of the pore. The mutants E163K and E66K/E163K are endowed with an almost full inversion of the ion selectivity. Both single mutations partially restore the voltage dependence of the pore. We found that an additional effect with the double mutant E66K/E163K was the restoration of voltage dependence. Protein structure predictions highlight a 16 β-strand pattern, typical for porins. In a three-dimensional model of DmPorin2, Glu-66 and Glu-163 are close to the rim of the channel, on two opposite sides. DmPorin2 is expressed in all the fly tissues and in all the developmental stages tested.

Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28006-28008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 10Benz R. Kottke M. Brdiczka D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1022: 313-318Google Scholar). It is the receptor where kinases bind to the mitochondrial surface, which is also important for the metabolic energy channeling in the cell (11Fiek C. Benz R. Roos N. Brdzicka D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 688: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The role of mitochondrial porin isoform 1 or VDAC1 in apoptosis was also thoroughly investigated in the last few years (12Desagher S. Martinou J.C.

Science. 2003; 301: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar) focused on the VDAC2 isoform as an important player in the cell death pathway. In the last years it has been demonstrated that the chromosomes of eukaryotic cells contain several genes coding for porins. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae the deletion of the porin gene is not lethal for the cells unless they were forced to live under strictly mitochondrially driven, aerobic conditions (21Dihanic M. Suda K. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 723-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This observation led to the discovery of a second gene, coding for a porin analogue and termed VDAC2 by sequence homology (22Blachly-Dyson E. Song J. Wolfgang W.J. Colombini M. Forte M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5727-5738Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Although the yeast VDAC2 is unable to form channels in vitro, its overexpression complements the inability to grow on non-fermentable carbon sources, the cellular defect induced by the VDAC1 deletion (23Blachly-Dyson E. Zambronicz E.B. Yu W.H. Adams V. McCabe E.R.B. Adelman J. Colombini M. Forte M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1835-1841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The genomes of humans, rats, and mice contain three different porin genes coding for distinctly expressed isoforms (23Blachly-Dyson E. Zambronicz E.B. Yu W.H. Adams V. McCabe E.R.B. Adelman J.

Biol. 1999; 170: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Human and mouse VDAC1 and VDAC2 isoforms show channel forming activity in vitro and can complement the yeast VDAC1 deficiency, whereas VDAC3 can only partially complement this defect (25Xu X. Decker W. Sampson M.J. Craigen W.J. Colombini M. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 170: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). An interesting picture of the porin genes in a higher eukaryotic organism has been revealed in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The porin gene, which codes for DmPorin1, was cloned, sequenced, and mapped at 32B3-4 on the second chromosome. It has an identity of about 60% compared with those of the porin isoforms in mammals (26Messina A. Neri M. Perosa F. Caggese C. Marino M. Caizzi R. De Pinto V. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 27Oliva M. Messina A. Ragone G. Caggese C. De Pinto V. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The organization of the region adjacent to the porin locus was elucidated after completion of the fruit fly genome. Most surprising, it revealed the close proximity of three additional genes with significant homology to the porin gene called CG17137, CG17139, and CG17140 (28Oliva M. De Pinto V. Barsanti P. Caggese C. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2002; 267: 746-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These three genes were predicted in silico by alignment of the genomic sequences with the EST sequences in the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project collection. They are on the same strand as the porin gene, and they have a similar organization with two introns interrupting the coding sequence (28Oliva M. De Pinto V. Barsanti P. Caggese C. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2002; 267: 746-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The 5′-untranslated region is present only in the porin gene. The nucleotide distances separating the four porin-like genes are extremely reduced. EST sequences have been reported for CG17137 and for CG17139 and CG17140, albeit considerably less frequent than for the porin gene. In a most recent update of the Flybase Data Bank (FLYBASE, FBgn0051722; LocusID, 34497), the putative genes CG17139 and CG17140 have been considered as a single transcription unit termed CG31722, since no 3′-EST is available for the gene CG17139. The expression of CG17137 and CG31722 is established at the transcriptional level, since the corresponding ESTs have been identified. Alignment of the deduced protein sequences shows sequence conservation in pairs. The protein sequence deduced from CG17137 is 42% identical to D. melanogaster porin isoform 1, but it is only 26% identical to the deduced amino acid sequence of CG17140 or CG31722 (28Oliva M. De Pinto V. Barsanti P. Caggese C. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2002; 267: 746-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In this paper we have cloned the coding sequence corresponding to CG17137 and expressed it in Escherichia coli. The expressed protein was purified and refolded. It showed pore forming activity with features resembling but not overlapping those of the isoform 1. In addition, the functional characterization revealed new features that could be of general interest to the understanding of the function of this protein. Site-directed mutagenesis of amino acids that are different in both porin sequences allowed interesting insights into the role of these amino acids in voltage dependence of eukaryotic porin. PCR Amplification of D. melanogaster Porin-coding Sequences—The CG17137 (FLYBASE, FBgn0032308; LocusID, 34499) coding sequence was amplified from a D. melanogaster male adult cDNA library in λgt10 using the primers DmPorin2for and DmPorin2rev (Table I). The primer DmPorin2for introduces a BamHI restriction site and the ATG start codon into the PCR product, whereas the primer DmPorin2rev introduces a HindIII restriction site and the TAA stop codon. 1.5 μl of phage lysate from the library were added to 28.5 μl of H2O, warmed at 70 °C for 5 min, and incubated on ice. The PCR was performed according to standard protocol in a volume of 50 μl, and the final concentration of dNTPs was 0.2 mm each; the MgCl2 final concentration was 1.5 mm, and the final concentration of the primers was 0.5 μm each. The PCR product was cloned into the linear TOPO-TA vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced (GenBank™ accession number AJ580916).Table IPrimers used for amplification of DmPorins and mutants The mutagenized nucleotides are in boldface type.

Neri M. Perosa F. Caggese C. Marino M. Caizzi R. De Pinto V. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The upstream primer DmPorin1for introduced the BamHI restriction site and the ATG start codon into the PCR product; similarly, the downstream primer DmPorin1rev introduced a HindIII site together with the TAA stop codon. 10 ng of plasmid were used as template, and the reaction was performed in a volume of 50 μl. All the other conditions were the same as described above. Cloning was in the TOPO-TA vector (Invitrogen). PCR Amplification of CG17137 from D. melanogaster Developmental Stage cDNA Libraries—The same PCR was performed to check whether the CG17137 gene was transcribed in other developmental stages of the fly. Eight different cDNA libraries were used as templates: embryo 0–3 h; embryo 12–24 h; embryo I–II instar larval stages; early III instar larval stage; late III instar larval stage; pupal instar stage; and late pupal instar stage. The protocol for PCR and the amplification parameters were the same as described above. PCR was also designed on Rp49, a ribosomal protein, and was used to amplify the underlying sequence in the various libraries to standardize the template amount (not shown). Cloning in the pQE30 Vector—The fragments released from the TOPO TA vector after digestion with BamHI and HindIII were ligated in the expression vector pQE30 (Qiagen) to obtain the plasmid pQE30DmPorin2. pQE30DmPorin2 also codes for an additional six histidines (His tag) upstream of the polyclonal site containing the cDNA coding for DmPorin2. XL10 gold ultracompetent cells (Stratagene) were transformed using 110 ng of pQE30DmPorin2, following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The cells were spread on an ampicillin- and kanamycin-containing agar plate. Positive clones were picked, and the plasmid DNA was extracted from a single colony, digested, and checked on a 1% agarose gel for the right fragment size and was finally sequenced. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The QuickChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to change two glutamic acids (Glu-66 and Glu-163) into two lysines in the DmPorin2 sequence by PCR. The mutant plasmid pQE30DmPorin2e66k was obtained by using the DmPorin2 cDNA cloned in the plasmid pQE30 as template and the primers E66Kfor and E66Krev (Table I). Similarly, the mutant plasmid pQE30DmPorin2e163k was obtained by mutagenesis of pQE30DmPorin2 with the primers E163Kfor and E163Krev (Table I). A double mutant, harboring both the E66K and E163K mutations, has been created using pQE30DmPorin2e66k as template in a further PCR with the primers E163Kfor and E163Krev. The PCR was performed according to the protocol of the manufacturer with Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (2.5 units) and 125 ng of the primers. The amount of template used was 10 ng. The PCR product was digested using DpnI (10 units) at 37 °C for 1h.1 μl of the digested DNA was transformed in competent E. coli M15 cells. The DNA purified from single colonies was sequenced to check the products. Heterologous Expression of DmPorin Genes—The expression of the different genes was performed in E. coli strains devoid of the major porin genes (genotype: BL21(DE3), ΔlamB ompF::Tn5 ΔompA ΔompC) to avoid possible contamination by bacterial pore-forming proteins. An overnight culture in LB medium of modified E. coli BL21 cells containing one of the different plasmids, pQE30DmPorin2, pQE30DmPorin2e66k, pQE30DmPorin2e163k, pQE30DmPorin2e66/163k, and pQE30DmPorin1, was diluted 1:20 in 50 ml of fresh medium and grown to an absorbance of 0.6 at 600 nm. 1 ml of culture was removed for control purposes, and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to the culture in a final concentration of 1 mm to induce expression of DmPorin2 and its mutants. The cells were harvested by centrifugation after growth for another 5 h. The pellet was suspended in 8 m urea, 100 mm NaH2PO4, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) and incubated for 1 h to allow the lysis of the inclusion bodies containing the recombinant proteins. The suspension in urea was centrifuged for 20 min at 10,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge, and the supernatant was collected and loaded on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid spin column already equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with a buffer containing 8 m urea, 100 mm NaH2PO4, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.3) to remove all the endogenous proteins bound to the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. The recombinant proteins were eluted from the column with a solution containing 8 m urea, 100 mm NaH2PO4, and 10 mm Tris (pH 4.5). All the samples were loaded onto a 12% SDS-PAGE to check induction and purification of the proteins. Renaturation of the Protein—The proteins purified under denaturing conditions (8 m) have lost their structure under these conditions and needed to be refolded to get channel-forming activity in lipid bilayer experiments (29Popp B. Court D.A. Benz R. Neupert W. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13593-13599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The eluted proteins were dialyzed at 4 °C overnight against a solution containing 1% Genapol X-080 (Fluka) supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) cholesterol. The proteins were kept at 4 °C before use in the black lipid bilayer measurements. Lipid Bilayer Experiments—The method used for the black lipid bilayer experiments has been described previously (30Benz R. Janko K. Boos W. Lauger P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 511: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Membranes were formed from a 1% (w/v) solution of diphytanoylphosphatidylcholine (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster AL) in n-decane by painting onto a circular hole (surface area about 0.4 mm2) separating the two compartments of a Teflon cell. For standard single channel conductance experiments, the Teflon chamber was filled with an unbuffered salt solution. The voltage across the membrane was applied through silver/silver chloride electrodes (with salt bridges) inserted into the aqueous compartments on both sides of the membrane. The membrane current was measured with a current amplifier (Keithley 427 current amplifier). The amplified signal was monitored with a storage oscilloscope and recorded on a strip chart recorder. Zero current potential measurements were performed using a high impedance electrometer (Keithley 617 current amplifier) as described previously (31Benz R. Janko K. Lauger P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 551: 238-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Voltage Dependence Studies—The refolded recombinant protein was added at a concentration of 500 ng/ml to both sides of a black diphytanoylphosphatidylcholine/n-decane membrane. After about 20 min, the reconstitution of porin channels into the membrane reached equilibrium. Then different potentials were applied to both sides of the membrane starting with ±10 mV (data not shown). These experiments were repeated with ±20 to ±80 mV in steps of ±10 mV. The experiments were analyzed in the following way. The membrane conductance (G) as a function of voltage, Vm, was measured when the opening and closing of channels reached an equilibrium, i.e. after the exponential decay of the membrane current following the voltage step Vm. G was divided by the initial value of the conductance (G0, which was a linear function of the voltage) obtained immediately after the onset of the voltage. Ion Selectivity Determination—Diphytanoylphosphatidylcholine membranes were formed in 50 mm KCl, and concentrated porin solutions were added to the aqueous phase when the membranes were in the black state. After incorporation of 10–100 channels into a membrane, salt gradients were established by addition of small amounts of concentrated KCl solution to one side of the membrane. Analysis of the zero current membrane potential was performed using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation (31Benz R. Janko K. Lauger P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 551: 238-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional Modeling of the DmPorin2 Amino Acid Sequence—The three-dimensional model of DmPorin2 was computed by using a procedure similar to that adopted previously for porin (isoform 1 or VDAC1) (7Casadio R. Jacoboni I. Messina A. De Pinto V. FEBS Lett. 2002; 520: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In summary, the protein topography starting from the sequence was predicted with a neural network-based method and a hidden Markov model-based method (32Jacoboni I. Martelli P.L. Fariselli P. De Pinto V. Casadio R. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 33Martelli P.L. Fariselli P. Krogh A. Casadio R. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: S46-S53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both predictors suggested 16 transmembrane strands along the protein sequence, with the same reliability index. An α-helix predictor detected a putative α-helical segment in the N-terminal portion of the chain (residues 7–20, data not shown), similar to what was reported previously (7Casadio R. Jacoboni I. Messina A. De Pinto V. FEBS Lett. 2002; 520: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) for VDAC1. The target was then modeled on templates taken from the Protein Data Bank (codes 2OMF, 1PRN, and 2POR) with the same number of strands in the barrel. MODELLER 6.2 (34Eswar N. John B. Mirkovic N. Fiser A. Ilyin V.A. Pieper U. Stuart A.C. Marti-Renom M.A. Madhusudhan M.S. Yerkovich B. Sali A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3375-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) was used to perform essentially a building by homology procedure. The N-terminal portion was not considered, since the expert-driven alignment between the target and the templates is strictly based on the transmembrane regions, constraining gaps in the loop regions, external to the membrane phase. Small differences in the alignment led to slightly different models; the model with the best PROCHECK (35Laskowki R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) score (minimum percentage of residues in disallowed conformation) was considered as the most reliable model. Expression and Purification of DmPorin1 and DmPorin2— Fig. 1A shows an agarose gel of the PCR amplification from the D. melanogaster male adult cDNA library using the primers DmPorin2for and reverse specific for CG17137 (DmPorin2) and the primers DmPorin1for and reverse specific for porin (DmPorin1). Both cDNAs were cloned in a TA vector and then in the pQE30 expression vector to yield the plasmids pQE30DmPorin1 and pQE30DmPorin2. Both plasmids were transferred into an E. coli BL21 strain, which lacks all major outer membrane proteins. The expressed proteins were purified from inclusion bodies. They had the expected apparent molecular masses (Fig. 1B). The expression level in bacteria was around 30 μg of protein/ml of bacterial culture for both proteins, and the purified protein was free of bacterial contaminants as judged by SDS-PAGE. PCR Amplification of the Gene for DmPorin2 in Different RNA-derived cDNA Libraries—A similar PCR amplification was performed on a set of D. melanogaster libraries derived by poly(A)+ RNA purified at different developmental stages of the fly (Fig. 2). The coding sequence delimited by the PCR primers (DmPorin2for and rev) was specifically amplified in all the libraries tested and had a similar level. This result demonstrates that the gene of DmPorin2 was transcribed in all developmental stages of D. melanogaster. Channel Forming Activity and Voltage Dependence of the Recombinant Porins—The electrophysiological properties of the purified and refolded DmPorin1 were studied in black lipid bilayer membranes and compared with those of the native porin purified from D. melanogaster mitochondria, which have been reported previously (36De Pinto V. Benz R. Caggese C. Palmieri F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 987: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Single channel experiments performed with small amounts of refolded recombinant protein (1–10 ng/ml) in 1 m KCl showed current increases in discrete steps with a predominant single channel conductance of about 4.5 nS (Fig. 3), similar to native porin isolated from D. melanogaster mitochondria. This result also indicated that the His tag attached to the recombinant protein did not interfere with the channel conductance. In the next step the voltage dependence of DmPorin1 was analyzed. Voltage dependence is a typical feature of mitochondrial porins (3Benz R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Starting with application of about 20–30 mV, the membrane current decreased in an exponential fashion for both positive and negative potentials. This result indicated symmetrical response to the applied voltage. The data of Fig. 3D show the plot of the relative conductance G/G0 as a function of the applied voltage, i.e. it corresponds to the voltage dependence of DmPorin1. It is noteworthy that the voltage dependence of the recombinant porin was identical to that measured previously with the native mitochondrial porin of D. melanogaster (36De Pinto V. Benz R. Caggese C. Palmieri F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 987: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These results indicate that recombinant DmPorin1 was successfully re-natured and that its properties were undistinguishable from those of native porin. Similar experiments were performed with the refolded recombinant DmPorin2. It also formed channels in lipid bilayer membranes with a long lifetime at low voltage. DmPorin2 also formed preferentially channels with a single channel conductance of 4.5 nS in 1 m KCl (Fig. 3A). However, the channel forming activity was much smaller than that of DmPorin1 under otherwise identical conditions. At least a 10 times higher concentration of DmPorin2 was needed to obtain the same number of reconstituted channels as compared with DmPorin1. It is unknown whether this is a normal feature of DmPorin2 or is because of an incomplete refolding process. The results of single channel experiments suggest that both porins form channels with very similar properties (Fig. 3). The voltage dependence of DmPorin2 was also investigated and compared with that of DmPorin1. Most surprising, DmPorin2 did not display any voltage dependence as clearly evidenced by Fig. 3, B and D. The single channel conductance of DmPorin1 and DmPorin2 in different salt solutions was also studied. The recombinant DmPorin1 and DmPorin2 proteins formed channels that had the same conductance only in 1 m KCl. However, in other salt solutions with different mobility of the ions the conductance differed. When the salt was composed of the highly mobile Cl- anion and the less mobile Li+ cation, the conductance of DmPorin1 was about twice that recorded with DmPorin2. The opposite was the case when a less mobile anion (CH3COO-) was combined with a mobile cation (K+). This influence on the conductance could be explained by the effect of charges influencing ion transport through the channel, i.e. DmPorin1 and DmPorin2 could exhibit different ion selectivity (Fig. 3C). This possibility was studied by zero current membrane potential measurements, which allow the calculation of the permeability ratio Pcation divided by Panion (Pc/Pa) for channels in multichannel experiments. In all experiments with DmPorin1, the more diluted side of the membrane became neg"

PS is subjected to an endoproteolytic cleavage, generating a stable heterodimer composed of an N-terminal and a C-terminal fragment. Here we aimed at further understanding the role of PS in endoproteolysis, in proteolytic processing of APP and Notch, and in assembly of the γ-secretase complex. By using a truncation protocol and alanine scanning, we identified Tyr-288 in the PS1 N-terminal fragment as critical for PS-dependent intramembrane proteolysis. Further mutagenesis of the 288 site identified mutants differentially affecting endoproteolysis and γ-secretase activity. The Y288F mutant was endoproteolyzed to the same extent as wild type PS but increased the amyloid β-protein 42/40 ratio by ∼75%. In contrast, the Y288N mutant was also endoproteolytically processed but was inactive in reconstituting γ-secretase in PS null cells. The Y288D mutant was deficient in both endoproteolysis and γ-secretase activity. All three mutant PS1 molecules were incorporated into γ-secretase complexes and stabilized Pen-2 in PS null cells. Thus, mutations at Tyr-288 do not affect γ-secretase complex assembly but can differentially control endoproteolysis and γ-secretase activity.

In parallel with γ-secretase-mediated Aβ generation, a cytosolic fragment, the APP intracellular domain (AICD), is formed. The N terminus of AICD is located 8–10 residues C-terminal to the site predicted by the γ-secretase cleavages generating Aβ40 and Aβ42 (2Sastre M. Steiner H. Fuchs K. Capell A. Multhaup G.

Competition studies in vitro suggest that cleavage at the ϵ site is intimately related to γ-secretase cleavage (3Kimberly W.T. Esler W.P. Ye W. Ostaszewski B. Gao J. Diehl T. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 137-144Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence suggests that the PS proteins are required in order for γ-secretase cleavage to occur (4De Strooper B. Annaert W. Cupers P.

Endogenously expressed PS protein is endoproteolytically cleaved in the large cytosolic loop, thus generating a 25-kDa N-terminal fragment (NTF) and an 18-kDa C-terminal fragment (CTF).

Many substrates in addition to APP have been identified as targets for PS-dependent processing, among them the family of Notch cell surface receptors (4De Strooper B. Annaert W. Cupers P. Saftig P.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9026-9031Google Scholar). Here we used a recently developed luciferase-based reporter system (21Karlström H. Bergman A. Lendahl U. Näslund J. Lundkvist J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6763-6766Google Scholar, 22Struhl G. Adachi A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 625-636Google Scholar) to define structural elements in PS1 that are critical for mediating endoproteolysis and γ-secretase complex assembly and activity. We have previously shown that PS1 NTF and CTF restore γ-secretase cleavage of the two best-known PS-controlled regulated intramembrane proteolysis substrates, APP and Notch, when co-expressed in PS-deficient cells (23Laudon H. Mathews P.M. Karlström H. Bergman A. Farmery M.R. Nixon R.A. Winblad B. Gandy S.E. Lendahl U. Lundkvist J. Näslund J. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 44-53Google Scholar). By using progressively truncated NTFs and alanine-scanning mutagenesis, we defined a short motif in the cytoplasmic loop juxtaposed to the endoproteolytic site that is required for γ-secretase activation. The major activity determinant of the motif was the Tyr-288 residue. Extensive mutagenesis revealed the basic biochemical characteristics of the amino acid occupying position 288 critical for restoring PS1 endoproteolysis and PS1-mediated γ-secretase activity. An analysis of the Y288F, Y288N, and Y288D mutants revealed that the capacity for endoproteolysis and γ-secretase activity can be separated, whereas the incorporation into the mature γ-secretase complex was retained. Expression Constructs—The reporter constructs that were used in the luciferase-based reporter system to monitor AICD and notch intra-cellular domain generation have been described previously (21Karlström H. Bergman A. Lendahl U. Näslund J. Lundkvist J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6763-6766Google Scholar, 24Taniguchi Y. Karlström H. Lundkvist J. Mizutani T. Otaka A. Vestling M. Bernstein A. Donoviel D. Lendahl U. Honjo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4014-4019Google Scholar). Full-length PS1 and PS1 NTFs were in the pcDNA3 backbone, and the CTF was in pcDNA3.1. The NTF constructs illustrated in Fig. 1A encode PS1 molecules truncated after amino acids Met-298 (NTF), Gly-266 (HD6stop), Glu-243 (HD5stop), Lys-216 (HD4stop), and Arg-157 (HD2stop), respectively. Mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis according to the QuikChange™ protocol (Stratagene). The DNA sequence of each construct was verified using the DYEnamic ET Terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences) and the ABI Prism 377 sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). PS1 constructs used for generating stable cell lines were cloned into the pCAG-IRES-Puro vector using conventional cloning procedures. Cell Culture and Transfection—Blastocyst-derived embryonic stem cells lacking PS1 and PS2 (BD8 cells) previously had been generated by immortalizing cells from PS1/PS2 double-null mice on embryonic day 3.5 (24Taniguchi Y. Karlström H. Lundkvist J. Mizutani T. Otaka A. Vestling M. Bernstein A. Donoviel D. Lendahl U. Honjo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4014-4019Google Scholar, 25Donoviel D.B. Hadjantonakis A.-K. Ikeda M. Zheng H. St George-Hyslop P. Bernstein A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2801-2810Google Scholar). The BD8 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2.4 mm l-glutamine, 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and nonessential amino acids. Stably transfected BD8 cells were maintained in medium supplemented with 1 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). All of the transfections were carried out using LipofectAMINE Plus according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Luciferase-based Reporter Assays and Immunoblotting—Transfections for the luciferase-based reporter assays were carried out in 24-well tissue culture plates essentially as described previously (23Laudon H. Mathews P.M. Karlström H. Bergman A. Farmery M.R. Nixon R.A. Winblad B. Gandy S.E. Lendahl U. Lundkvist J. Näslund J. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 44-53Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer/well (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.65% Nonidet P-40), and luciferase activity was monitored luminometrically after the addition of luciferin and ATP (BioThema). The β-galactosidase activities of the cell lysates were determined to equalize for differences in transfection efficiencies. Arbitrary β-galactosidase-normalized luminescence units are presented as percent activity compared with wild type PS1 response. For immunoblotting, cell lysates were briefly sonicated and resolved on 10–20% Tricine gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes that were subsequently probed with appropriate antibodies. The immunoblots were developed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL substrate (Pierce). Antibodies—The antibodies used for co-immunoprecipitations of PS1 were polyclonal antibody Ab14 raised against the N terminus of PS1 (18Seeger M. Nordstedt C. Petanceska S. Kovacs D.M. Gouras G.K. Hahne S. Fraser P. Levesque L. Czernik A.J. St George-Hyslop P. Sisodia S.S. Thinakaran G. Tanzi R.E. Greengard P. Gandy S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For immunoblotting of PS1, monoclonal antibody NT1 directed toward the N terminus (26Mathews P.M. Cataldo A.M. Kao B.H. Rudnicki A.G. Qin X. Yang J.L. Jiang Y. Picciano M. Hulette C. Lippa C.F.

Nicastrin was immunoprecipitated using polyclonal antibody N1660 (Sigma), and Aph-1 was immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibody H2D (Calbiochem). Polyclonal antibody 369 (27Buxbaum J.D. Gandy S.E. Cicchetti P. Ehrlich M.E. Czernik A.J. Fracasso R.P. Ramabhadran T.V. Unterbeck A.J. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Polyclonal antibody UD1 was used for immunoblotting of Pen-2 (29Bergman A. Hansson E. Pursglove S.E. Farmery M.R. Lannfelt L. Lendahl U. Lundkvist J. Näslund J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16744-16753Google Scholar). Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Transient transfections were performed in 6-well plates in triplicates. Per well, cells were transiently transfected with 500 ng of C99-encoding vector. Cells were cultured for 48 h in 0.75 ml of Opti-MEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. Cell media were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and subjected to sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay measurements essentially as described previously (28Mathews P.M. Jiang Y. Schmidt S.D. Grbovic O.M. Mercken M. Nixon R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36415-36424Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitations—Co-immunoprecipitations were performed on lysates from stably transfected cells. Cells were cultured to confluency in a 6-well format. Per well, cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of coimmunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and 1% CHAPSO) and briefly sonicated. Lysates were subjected to ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 20 min). The CHAPSO-soluble supernatant was incubated with primary antibody (dilution 1:300) overnight, and proteins were pulled down with a mixture of proteins A- and G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Pre-immune serum was used as negative control. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved on 10–20% Tricine gels (Invitrogen), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and detected by immunoblotting as described above. Subcellular Fractionation—PS-deficient BD8 cells and BD8 cells stably expressing wild type or mutant PS1 were cultured in 10-cm plates to near confluency. Per cell line, the cells from two plates were harvested and homogenized in ice-cold homogenization buffer (130 mm KCl, 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were overlaid onto the top of a step gradient consisting of 1 ml each of 30, 25, 20, 15, 12.5, 10, 7.5, and 5% iodixanol (OptiPrep reagent, Axis-Shield PoC AS) diluted in homogenization buffer. After 90 min of centrifugation at 126,000 × g (Beckman), fractions were collected from the top of the gradient. After dilution, membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min. Proteins were resolved on 4–20% Tris-glycine gels (Criterion, Bio-Rad), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and detected by immunoblotting as described above. Co-expression of C-terminally Truncated NTF and Native CTF—We have recently shown that co-expression of the PS1 NTF and CTF can functionally substitute for the expression of the full-length molecule in mammalian PS null cells (23Laudon H. Mathews P.M. Karlström H. Bergman A. Farmery M.R. Nixon R.A. Winblad B. Gandy S.E. Lendahl U. Lundkvist J. Näslund J. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 44-53Google Scholar). Based on this knowledge, we designed an experimental protocol where truncated NTFs were co-expressed with wild type CTF in a PS-deficient cellular background. We used blastocyst-derived mouse embryonic stem cells lacking PS1 and PS2 (25Donoviel D.B. Hadjantonakis A.-K. Ikeda M. Zheng H. St George-Hyslop P. Bernstein A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2801-2810Google Scholar) and a luciferase-based reporter system that quantifies intramembrane processing (21Karlström H. Bergman A. Lendahl U. Näslund J. Lundkvist J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6763-6766Google Scholar) to study γ-secretase cleavage of APP and Notch. To this end, we used truncated versions of APP and Notch, which mimic β-secretase-processed APP (C99) and ligand-activated and ectodomain-shedded Notch1 (ΔEN1) (30Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Google Scholar). C99 and ΔEN1 both represent direct substrates for PS-dependent intramembrane processing. An array of successively truncated NTFs (Fig. 1A) was transfected into PS null cells together with wild type CTF (Fig. 1B). Of the fragments tested, only the native NTF was able to mediate γ-secretase processing of C99 and ΔEN1. Expression of the NTFs was confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 1B, lower panel). Thus, residues 267–298 in the cytoplasmic loop of the NTF are critical for rescuing γ-secretase activity in PS-deficient cells. To demarcate the γ-secretase-activating domain in the 32-residue sequence defined above, an additional array of truncated NTF variants was generated (Fig. 1C). These NTFs were co-transfected with native CTF, and γ-secretase cleavage of C99 and ΔEN1 was measured (Fig. 1D). PS1-controlled γ-secretase activity was dramatically decreased when PS1 residues 284–288 were deleted, indicating that a key sequence is located in hydrophobic domain 7 between residues Pro-284 and Tyr-288. This PALIY motif is situated just N-terminal to the physiological endoproteolysis site (Fig. 1A), which is mapped to a region positioned between residues Thr-291 and Ala-299 (31Podlisny M.B. Citron M. Amarante P. Sherrington R. Xia W. Zhang J. Diehl T. Levesque G. Fraser P. Haass C. Koo E.H.M. Seubert P. St George-Hyslop P. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. Neurobiol. Dis. 1997; 3: 325-337Google Scholar). Steady-state levels of the expressed NTF variants were corroborated by immunoblotting (Fig. 1D, lower panel). It is worth noting that this region is important for PS-mediated γ-secretase processing of both C99 and ΔEN1, implying that this motif may be critical not only for APP and Notch but possibly also for most or all of the other PS-controlled regulated intramembrane proteolysis substrates. To more precisely assess the residues in the PALIY motif critical for mediating the γ-secretase-activating effect, alanine mutants were generated in the PS1 full-length protein. Mutant PS1 proteins were transfected into the PS-deficient cells, and γ-secretase cleavage of C99 and ΔEN1 was recorded. The Y288A mutant exhibited a pronounced reduction in γ-secretase, rescuing activity for both C99 and ΔEN1 (73 and 58% reduction, respectively) (Fig. 1E). The effect of exchanging the other residues in the activating element for alanine was less apparent on C99 (16, 26, and 22% reduction for P284A, L286A, and I287A, respectively) (Fig. 1E). The results for ΔEN1 were somewhat different compared with C99, and here in fact, there was a small increase for P284A and I287A (10 and 8%, respectively) (Fig. 1E). Importantly, the Ala mutations did not impair endoproteolysis of the mutant PS1 holoprotein (Fig. 1E, lower panel). However, to exclude the possibility that changes in endoproteolysis too small to be detected by immunoblotting account for the Y288A effect observed above, Ala mutations were also introduced into the NTF. When expressed together with wild type CTF, these NTF mutants showed a pattern similar to the mutant full-length proteins on rescue of γ-secretase processing (Fig. 1F). In contrast to the decreased C99 processing for full-length PS1 mutants P284A, L286A, and I287A, when introduced into the NTF, these mutations increased γ-secretase cleavage of C99 with 12, 4, and 38%, respectively. Importantly, the Y288A substitution reduced the γ-secretase-rescuing effect with ∼50–60%. Taken together, these data suggest that Tyr-288 is the main determinant of the PALIY motif for sustaining γ-secretase. Apparently, an Ala mutation in position 288 of the activating element disrupts γ-secretase activity by some mechanism other than inhibition of PS1 endoproteolysis. Moreover, an NTF ending at residue 287, thereby lacking Tyr-288, did not rescue γ-secretase activity when co-expressed with CTF (data not shown). Thus, Tyr-288 in PS1 is crucial for restoring γ-secretase activity in PS null cells. Site-directed Mutagenesis of Tyr-288 —To obtain a more detailed view on the characteristics of the residue occupying position 288, we subjected this residue to mutagenesis in PS1 full-length protein and in the NTF. We used the luciferase assay to study C99 processing when these mutants were transiently expressed in PS-deficient cells. Using this qualitative approach, we could show that hydrophobic and bulky residues in position 288 of the full-length protein or NTF restored γ-secretase processing of C99 (Fig. 2, A and B). For some mutants, intramembrane proteolysis of C99 was considerably enhanced, in particular when the mutation was introduced in the NTF. For example, the Y288M and Y288W mutations increased γ-secretase activity with 70 and 28%, respectively (Fig. 2B). Polar and charged residues were less well tolerated in the 288 position. C99 processing was in some cases dramatically reduced when these mutants (e.g. Y288D, Y288N) were expressed (Fig. 2, A and B). The PALIY motif and the Tyr-288 residue are located close to the PS endoproteolysis site, and because the functional significance of PS endoproteolysis with regard to γ-secretase activity remains unclear, we assayed the Tyr-288 mutants for endoproteolysis. Some of the mutants tested, Y288D, Y288E, and Y288K, also had a profound negative effect on endoproteolysis of PS1 (Fig. 2C). Expression of PS1 Tyr-288 Mutants on a Null Background—We selected three mutants, Y288F, Y288N, and Y288D, for stable expression in the PS-deficient BD8 cells. The Y288F mutant restored C99 processing to the same extent as the PS1 wild type molecule (Fig. 3A). In contrast, neither the Y288N nor the Y288D mutant mediated γ-secretase cleavage of the C99 reporter molecule (Fig. 3A). Because the reporter assay used here does not differentiate between the γ- and ϵ-cleavage of the substrates, we wanted to directly analyze γ-secretase cleavage of C99 by measuring Aβ40 and Aβ42 secreted into medium. Consistent with the findings for AICD formation, expression of the Y288N and Y288D mutants did not result in any detectable Aβ40 or Aβ42 secretion (data not shown). Interestingly, expression of the intramembrane proteolysis-active Y288F mutant resulted in an ∼75% increase in the Aβ42/40 ratio compared with the wild type PS1 molecule (Fig. 3B). Tyr-288 Mutants and γ-Secretase Complex Assembly—The failure of the Y288N and Y288D mutants to restore PS-mediated intramembrane proteolysis in PS null cells could possibly be related to misincorporation of the mutants into fully assembled and mature γ-secretase complexes. Therefore, we performed immunoblotting experiments of CHAPSO lysates prepared from the stable cell lines (Fig. 4). In lysates, NTF and CTF can be clearly visualized from BD8 cells stably expressing wild type PS1 (panel I, lane 2). In addition, the expression of PS1 in PS-deficient cells leads to stabilization of Pen-2 as shown previously (29Bergman A. Hansson E. Pursglove S.E. Farmery M.R. Lannfelt L. Lendahl U. Lundkvist J. Näslund J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16744-16753Google Scholar, 32Steiner H. Winkler E. Edbauer D. Prokop S. Basset G. Yamasaki A. Kostka M. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39062-39065Google Scholar). As suggested from the luciferase experiments, the biochemical phenotype of the Y288F mutant resembled that of the wild type molecule (panel I, lane 3). As shown above using transient transfections, endoproteolysis of the Y288D mutant is severely impaired also in stably transfected cells (panel I, lane 4). Interestingly, the Y288N mutant, which cannot restore γ-secretase processing of C99, is endoproteolytically processed to a level almost comparable with wild type PS1. Expression of both Y288D and Y288N leads to the stabilization of Pen-2, indirectly implying that the mutants were incorporated into mature, albeit non-functional, γ-secretase complexes. Correct complex incorporation of the mutants was further corroborated using co-immunoprecipitations. The CTF was coprecipitated with the NTF for all of the stably expressed PS1 variants, albeit very little for the endoproteolysis-defective Y288D mutant (panel III, lanes 2–5). It is worth noting that Pen-2 associates and apparently co-precipitates with full-length Y288D (panel III, lane 4), in agreement with a previous report showing association between Pen-2 and the D257A and D385A PS1 mutants (33Nyabi O. Bentahir M. Horré K. Herreman A. Gottardi-Litell N. Van Broeckhoven C. Merchiers P. Spittaels K. Annaert W. De Strooper B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43430-43436Google Scholar). The NTF was associated with the CTF in reciprocal immunoprecipitations (panel IV, lanes 2–5). Immunoprecipitations against nicastrin and Aph-1 showed very similar immunostaining patterns when probing for the NTF and CTF (panels V and VI, lanes 2–5). The cleavage-compromised Y288D mutant associated with both nicastrin (panel V, lane 4) and Aph-1 (panel VI, lane 4) under these conditions. Complex assembly of the mutants was further investigated by subjecting membranes from the stable cell lines to iodixanol gradient fractionation (Fig. 5). This method allows separation of ER-rich vesicles from Golgi- and post-Golgi-rich vesicles (34Campbell W.A. Iskandar M.-K. Reed M.L.O. Xia W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3372-3379Google Scholar). We corroborated the separation between ER and Golgi by using the ER marker KDEL and medial-Golgi marker GM130, respectively. As previously shown by many groups (35Edbauer D. Winkler E. Haass C.

Moreover, as reported previously (29Bergman A. Hansson E. Pursglove S.E. Farmery M.R. Lannfelt L. Lendahl U. Lundkvist J. Näslund J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16744-16753Google Scholar), Pen-2 is sequestered in the ER and destined for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation in the absence of PS (panel A). In BD8 cells stably expressing wild type PS1, ER retention of Pen-2 was released and fully glycosylated nicastrin could be found in Golgi-rich fractions (panel B). Stable expression of the Y288N and Y288D mutants in BD8 cells resulted in almost identical subcellular distributions of Pen-2 and mature nicastrin for the mutants and wild type PS1 (panels B–D). It is notable that the full-length Y288D and Y288N mutants are distributed to Golgi-like fractions that overlap with fractions containing only NTF from the wild type molecule (compare panels C and D with B). In contrast to the wild type PS protein, which is mainly found in its cleaved form in Golgi-like fractions, the mutant full-length molecules are apparently distributed to post-ER compartments. This suggests that blocked endoproteolysis does not prevent the mutant molecules from being trafficked normally. In summary, exchanging Tyr-288 for Asn or Asp, thus rendering the PS1 molecul"

By using quantitative deuterium NMR, the redistribution of deuterium at natural abundance in lactic acid produced by the bacterial fermentation of glucose has been determined for each non-labile hydrogen atom of glucose or water and the hydrogen atoms of lactic acid. Distinct differences are observed in the lactic acid isolated from Lactococcus lactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides that can be interpreted in terms of the different fermentative pathways used. Specifically, the affiliations observed between the H1, H3, and H4 positions of glucose with methyl and hydroxymethylene of lactic acid can give quantitative information on whether the glycolytic or the reductive pentose-phosphate pathway was involved in glucose catabolism. For any given metabolic pathway, isotope redistribution coefficients (aij) that characterize the specific derivation of each hydrogen atom can be defined.

An intriguing aspect of the chemistry of living organisms is that numerous examples exist where different reaction schemes have evolved to perform essentially the same chemical operation. A well known example in microorganisms is the existence of several routes by which fermentable substrates are catabolized in anaerobic environments. Two principal routes exploited are glycolysis and the reductive pentose-phosphate (RPP) 1The abbreviations used are: RPP, reductive pentose-phosphate; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; G3P, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; KIE, kinetic isotope effect; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; Cf, conversion factor; nRH, number of totally protiated molecules; nRD, monodenterated number of molecules. pathway. Essentially, each pathway aims to extract energy as ATP and carbon skeletons for synthesis. Redox balance and reductant power, namely as NAD+/NADH or NADP+/NADPH, requires oxidant activity early in the pathway, and this needs to be regenerated to maintain energy balance and catabolize further substrate. This is achieved via a series of terminal reductase reactions, the precise nature of which varies with the organism. Both the glycolytic and RPP pathways occur in members of the industrially important group of bacteria that ferment sugars to lactic acid, the lactic acid bacteria. These bacteria exploit the reduction of pyruvate to lactate for NAD+ regeneration, with lactic acid accumulating in the medium. This acidification has an important role in many food preparation processes (1Vedamuthu E. J. Dairy Sci. 1994; 77: 2725-2737Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Growing anaerobically, lactic acid bacteria may be homofermentative, producing essentially 2 mol of lactate/mol of glucose by glycolysis, as is the case for Lactococcus (Lc.) lactis (2Cocaign-Bousquet M. Garrigues C. Loubière P. Lindley N. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1996; 70: 253-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Alternatively, as with Leuconostoc (Ln.) mesenteroides, the bacterium is heterofermentative, producing 1 mol of lactate/mol of glucose, with the remainder of the glucose skeleton being catabolized to various other products, including carbon dioxide, ethanol, and acetate (3Schmitt P. Diviès C. Cardona R. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1992; 36: 679-683Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Under certain genetic and/or environmental conditions, some lactic acid bacteria can also accumulate formate and the important flavor compounds diacetyl and acetoin (4Monnet C. Aymes F. Corrieu G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 5518-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 5Schmitt P. Diviès C. J. Ferm. Bioeng. 1991; 71: 72-74Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). During fermentation, the hydrogen in the products is derived either from the sugar substrate or from the medium. The use of 3H or highly enriched 2H tracers has largely established these origins. However, it has been shown that the isotopic redistribution in 2H (D) at natural abundance in products of fermentation can be quantitatively described using quantitative 2H NMR (6Pionnier S. Zhang B.-L. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 307: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 7Pionnier S. Robins R. Zhang B.-L. J. Agric. Food.

Rev. 2003; 2: 87-102Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, a transfer matrix can be defined that links the different isotopic contents (D/H)i at the various positions i of the product to the isotopic content (D/H)j at each position j of the fermented substrate and to (D/H)m, the isotopic content of the fermentation medium (7Pionnier S. Robins R. Zhang B.-L. J. Agric. Food. Chem. 2003; 51: 2076-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 9Zhang B.-L. Yunianta Martin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16023-16029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) as shown in Equation 1, [D/H]i=[A][D/H]k(Eq. 1) where [(D/H)]i and [D/H]k are the column vectors of the site-specific natural isotopic ratios of the product and the substrate and [A] the matrix composed of the redistribution coefficients. The matrix can be expanded as shown in Equation 2, (D/H)i=aim(D/H)m+∑jaij(D/H)j=∑kaik(D/H)k(Eq. 2) where (D/H)i is the isotopic ratio at position i of the product, (D/H)m is the isotopic ratio of the medium, and (D/H)j is the isotopic ratio at site j of the substrate. The terms aim and aij are isotope redistribution coefficients, m,j ϵ{k}. By defining the set of values for the matrix [A], the isotopic connection between the substrate and product molecule is defined, giving a quantitative description of the derivation of the deuterium atoms. Intrinsic to this description is the summated effect of the biochemical reactions involved and their kinetic isotope effects (KIEs). Each individual aij will reflect the mechanism of the individual reactions acting on each position j in the substrate linked to different positions i in the product. Thus, the KIEs will reflect the extent to which selection against (or for, in rarer cases) a heavy isotope has occurred at individual sites in the product, leading to a non-statistical distribution of 2H in the population of monodeuterated isotopomers within the final product (8Robins R. Billault I. Duan J.-R. Guiet S. Pionnier S. Zhang B.-L. Phytochem. Rev. 2003; 2: 87-102Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Because Lc. lactis and Ln. mesenteroides exploit different pathways for the catabolism of glucose, it can be anticipated that the redistribution coefficients aim and aij ought to differ for the methyl (CH3) and hydroxymethylene (CH(OH)) of lactic acid, depending on the catabolic route by which it was produced. Essentially, these two pathways differ in three key respects (Fig. 1): 1) in the metabolism of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P). Glycolysis provides two equivalent units of triose, derived from C1-C2-C3 and C4-C5-C6 of glucose, whereas RPP provides a single unit derived from C4-C5-C6; 2) in glycolysis the reductant is exclusively NADH, whereas in Ln. mesenteroides the RPP pathway can produce both NADH and NADPH; and 3) although the pathways converge at the triose unit, each producing glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), which follows a common metabolism to pyruvate, NAD+ is regenerated by the reduction of pyruvate to l-lactate in Lc. lactis and to d-lactate in Ln. mesenteroides. l-lactate dehydrogenase (EC1.1.1.27) and d-lactate dehydrogenase (EC1.1.1.28) both exclusively use NADH as cofactor (10Dennis D. Kaplan N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 810-818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but are mechanistically dissimilar (11Taguchi H. Ohta T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12588-12594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, it is shown that the isotopic redistribution in 2H between glucose and lactic acid isolated from distinct biological origins differs markedly and that these differences can be correlated to the fermentation pathway used. Materials—d-Glucose was obtained from Prolabo. Specifically labeled glucose (all at 98 atom %) was obtained from the following sources: [1-2H]glucose, [6,6′-2H2]glucose (Euriso-Top, Gif-sur-Yvette, France); [2-2H]glucose (Cambridge Isotope Labs., Andover, MA); [3-2H]glucose, [4-2H]glucose (OMICRON Biochemicals Inc., South Bend, IN). D2O (99.98 atom %) was obtained from Euriso-Top. Components of the culture medium were obtained as follows: tryptone, yeast extract (autolytic) (Biokar Diagnostics); casein-meat peptone (Labogros); soya-flour peptone (prepared using papain), sodium glycerophosphate (Merck); ascorbic acid, MgSO4 (Sigma). The same supply of each component was used for all fermentations. Bacterial Cultures—Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis biovar diacetylactis strain B7/2147 was obtained from the Collection of Lactic Acid Bacteria (Institute of Food Research, Norwich, UK: collection B7/2147). Leuconostoc mesenteroides mesenteroides strain 19D was obtained from the collection of the Laboratoire de Microbiologie Alimentaire Industrielle (ENITIAA, Nantes, France). Both strains were stored at –80 °C in M17 medium (12Terzaghi B. Sandine W. Appl. Microbiol. 1975; 29: 807-813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with 15% (v/v) glycerol. Culture Conditions—Routine culture was carried out in 600 ml of M17 medium (12Terzaghi B. Sandine W. Appl. Microbiol. 1975; 29: 807-813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in a 1-liter-capacity autoclavable vessel (Celstir) fitted with a pH probe, a peristaltic pump for pH regulation, and a sample port. M17 medium (490 ml of a 1.2-fold concentration) adjusted to pH 6.3 (2 m HCl) was sterilized in situ (30 min; 121 °C; 1 bar). A filter-sterilized solution of glucose (30 g, 167 mmol, in 100 ml H2O) was added as well as 10 ml of bacterial starter culture (M17 medium). Fermentation was anaerobic, stirred (120 rpm) at 30 °C. Acidity was maintained constant at pH 6.0 ± 0.1 by the pH electrode-regulated addition of aliquots of NaOH (2 m). In initial experiments, lactate accumulation was followed by HPLC. Subsequently, it was monitored by gravimetric determination of NaOH consumption. Fermentation was terminated when constant weight was attained and the complete consumption of glucose was verified by HPLC and/or 1H NMR (13Silvestre V. Goupry S. Trierweiler M. Robins R. Akoka S. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 1862-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Typically, Lc. lactis took about 48 h and Ln. mesenteroides about 72 h. Supernatant was recovered by centrifugation (5445 g; 10 min; 4 °C) and kept at –20 °C. To follow the affiliation between each position in the substrate, glucose, and each position in the product, lactic acid, a trace quantity of specifically enriched glucose was added to the fermentation medium. Typically, 8–15 mg (±0.1 mg) was added to 30.0 g (±0.1 g) d-glucose, giving ∼3–5-fold natural abundance (∼0.06%). At this level, the NMR properties of the molecule remain unaltered. The resulting enrichment was obtained by calculation and is given in Tables I and III.Table I(D/H)i of lactic acid produced in fermentation with Lactococcus lactis using labeled water or glucoseMediumGlucoseLactic acid(D/H)mLabeled site j(D/H)j of the reference(D/H)j of the labeled site(D/H)CH3(D/H)CHppmppmaRef = commercial corn glucose, for which the (D/H)i values (16) are given in column 3.ppmbThe (D/H)j values of the enriched glucose at site j, by calculation.ppmcMean values and S.D.

Following acidification to pH 2.2 (18 m H2SO4) and filtration, the volume was reduced by rotary evaporation to about half (in vacuo, <50 °C). Activated carbon (4 g) was added and rotation continued (atmospheric pressure, 40 °C, 2 h), after which the solution was filtered and further evaporated to about 100 ml. NaCl (2 g) was then added and dissolved. Lactic acid was recovered by exhaustive extraction with butan-2-one/diisopropyl ether (80/20) presaturated with water (14Zhang B.-L. Fallourd V. Role C. Martin G. Bioorg. Chem. 2003; 31: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Following agitation with an equal volume, the mixture was left at least 90 min to achieve full phase separation. Extraction was repeated five times and the organic phases pooled. Solvent was evaporated (in vacuo, 50 °C) to leave a viscous honey-colored solution of lactic acid in water. The lactic acid recovered, determined by HPLC or 1H NMR, was between 85 and 95% maximum theoretical yield. Purity was confirmed by 1H NMR. Residual water content was determined by HPLC on suitably diluted samples. In some samples, water content was determined by Karl-Fischer titration. Quantification of Lactic Acid—Lactic acid was quantified by HPLC using a Supelcogel C-610H column (30 cm × 7.8 mm; Supelco) eluted at 30 °C with H3PO4 (0.1%) at 0.5 ml·min–1 (Agilent 1100 pump). Samples were diluted between 100–1000-fold, and 20 μl was injected per analysis. Double detection was used in series, UV (Agilent 1050) at 210 nm for lactic acid and RI (Iota 2) for glucose. 2H NMR Spectroscopy—The 2H NMR spectra were recorded with a Brucker DPX 400 spectrometer operating at 61.4 MHz and fitted with a 19F field frequency locking device. The T1 values were measured by using an inversion recovery sequence with 12 inversion time values ranging from 5 ms to 6 s and calculated using the T1 calculation software provided. The repetition time (1.25 s, = 5 × longest T1) was set accordingly. Acquisition parameters: number of scans, 6000; sweep width, 1197 Hz; acquisition time, 0.6 s; delay, 0.6 s; pulse (90°), 21 μs; T = 323 K and broadband 1H decoupling. Sample preparation: ∼2.0gof extract (containing ∼1.6–1.9 g lactic acid in water) and 1.0 g of internal reference were mixed in a sample vial with C6F6 (50 μl, lock). Exact quantities were recorded. The sample was filtered and introduced into a 10-mm NMR tube. Three to five spectra were recorded for each sample and an exponential multiplication associated with a line broadening of 2 Hz was used. The quantitative calculation of the areas under the peaks was performed using a curve-fitting algorithm (PERCH Solutions Ltd., FIN-70211, Kuopio, Finland). The (D/H)i ratios for each spectrum were calculated from Equation 3, (DH)i=(PrefPi)(mrefms×Fs)(MsMref)(SiSref)(DH)ref(Eq. 3) where Pi and Pref are the stoichiometric numbers of hydrogens in site i and in the reference. Si and Sref are the surface areas of the signal. MS, mS, and Mref are respectively the molecular weight and mass of the sample and the reference used, and Fs is the correction factor for the water content of the sample. The internal reference (ref) was N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylurea for which the isotopic ratio, (D/H)ref, was calibrated on the V.SMOW scale (15Gonfiantini R. Stichler W. Rozanski K. International Atomic Energy Agency, Standards and Intercomparison Materials for Stable Isotopes of Light Elements. International Atomic Energy Agency, Vienna1995: 13-29Google Scholar). Lactic acid has two non-equivalent hydrogen positions: the methyl, with three non-exchangeable hydrogens, and the hydroxymethylene, with one non-exchangeable hydrogen. Glucose, monodeuterated at site 1, 2, 3, or 4 or bideuterated at 6-pro-R and 6-pro-S (6,6′ will be used to designate the mean of these two positions), was used to analyze the isotopic transfer coefficients. [5-2H]Glucose was not used because H5 is lost to the medium during the action of phosphopyruvate hydratase (EC4.2.1.11) and will not be transferred to lactic acid by either organism (Figs. 2 and 3). Glucose from corn (Zea mays) was used as reference, and the natural abundance (D/H)i was determined for each hydrogen position (16Zhang B.-L. Billault I. Li X.-B. Mabon F. Remaud G. Martin M. J. Agric. Food. Chem. 2002; 50: 1574-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Because (D/H)i is a linear function of (D/H)j or (D/H)m (Equation 1), isotope redistribution coefficients aij can be established using only two (D/H)i values and their corresponding (D/H)j or (D/H)m values. Thus, the affiliation was measured at natural abundance and ata3–5-fold site-specific enrichment. In all fermentations conducted with either Lc. lactis or Ln. mesenteroides, it was confirmed by HPLC that all glucose was consumed and that the yield of lactic acid was ≥95% of the theoretical yield for the pertinent pathway.Fig. 3Pathway of reductive pentose-phosphate fermentation of glucose in Ln. mesenteroides showing the hydrogen affiliations.

These data show that the transfer of deuterium from the glucose to l-lactic acid is site-specific and varies with the position j of the substrate. From the data in Table I, a set of linear equations is obtained as shown in Equations 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Isotope transfer coefficients for (D/H)CH3 from (D/H)3 and (D/H)4, and for (D/H)CH from (D/H)1, (D/H)2, (D/H)3, and (D/H)6,6′ are not significant. (Values are taken as non-significant if the (D/H)i differs by <2 S.D. from the natural abundance value: i.e. aij ≤ 0.02.) From Equations 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, the conversion factor (Cf) of each hydrogen to the CH3 or CH(OH) of lactic acid can be estimated (6Pionnier S. Zhang B.-L. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 307: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Because during glycolysis nRHfully proteated glucose molecules are converted to 2 nRH molecules of lactic acid Glucose(H)nRH → 2 Lactic acid(H)2 nRHReaction I then nRD site-j monodeuterated glucose molecules are converted to CfnRD site-i monodeuterated lactic acid molecules, where Cf is the conversion factor of site-j deuterated glucose (0 ≤ Cf ≤1).

Open table in a new tab Considerable redistribution of hydrogen has occurred in the catabolism of glucose to lactic acid. Thus, the affiliations of the CH3 with the positions 1, 2, and 6,6′ are all strong, whereas negligible transfer from 3 or 4 occurs. In terms of the formation of the intermediate common to these two end products, pyruvic acid (Fig. 2), the values of aij and the Cf values for (D/H)i,CH3 are markedly consistent with those previously reported for the glycolytic catabolism of glucose to ethanol and glycerol (6Pionnier S.

This indicates that the affiliation pattern and isotopic effects in glycolysis are relatively similar between the bacterium Lc. lactis and the mixed yeast culture (Saccharomyces crevasse and Saccharomyces bayanus) used by Pionnier et al. (7Pionnier S. Robins R. Zhang B.-L. J. Agric. Food. Chem. 2003; 51: 2076-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). There are, however, a number of quantitative differences. Theoretically, deuterium at the H1 or H6,6′ positions of glucose should be transferred to the CH3 of ethanol, glycerol, and lactic acid without loss. Whereas some loss of the H1 and effectively 100% incorporation of the H6,6′ was observed in Saccharomyces metabolism (7Pionnier S. Robins R. Zhang B.-L. J. Agric. Food.

These differences probably reflect differences in glucose utilization for other metabolic processes. In both cases, however, the degree of transfer for H2 is lower than for H1 (65–75%), reflecting some loss from this position during the intramolecular rearrangement of G6P to fructose-6-phosphate (Fig. 2, step 2). This is in good agreement with the known leakiness of the intramolecular transfer during isomerization (9Zhang B.-L. Yunianta Martin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16023-16029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 18Liemans V. Malaisse-Lagae F. Willem R. Malaisse W. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochem. 1990; 93: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The role of the medium in supplying hydrogen is also similar for all three products, although the am,CH3 values for lactic acid (0.33) and glycerol (0.52, 0.44) are higher than that for ethanol (0.18). A value of 0.33 for lactic acid is compatible with the overall introduction of at least one mol of hydrogen from the medium into the CH3 per mol of product. This can originate from the activity of pyruvate kinase (EC2.7.1.40) or during hexose-P isomerization (Fig. 2). The hydrogen at the CH(OH) of l-lactic acid is introduced at the terminal step of biosynthesis by the NADH-dependent enzyme l-lactate dehydrogenase (EC1.1.1.27), which is directly comparable with the last step in the formation of ethanol, acetaldehyde reduction, and the reduction of dihydroxyacetone phosphate to glycerol-1-P. Only the hydrogen at the glucose-H4 position is linked to CH(OH), with a transfer coefficient of 0.12. This, as previously demonstrated, indicates the transfer of the glucose-H4 to NAD+ by the action of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (phosphorylating) (EC1.2.1.12) (Fig. 2) and the reinsertion of this hydrogen because of the reductase activities. The extent of this transfer is extremely comparable in the biosynthesis of lactate (0.12), ethanol (0.18), and glycerol (0.20) (7Pionnier S. Robins R. Zhang B.-L. J. Agric. Food. Chem. 2003; 51: 2076-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 17Zhang B.-L. Buddrus S. Martin M. Bioorg. Chem. 2000; 28: 1-15Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The other major source of the hydrogen introduced at CH(OH) during the reductase step is water, for which a large transfer coefficient is found (0.66), as reported for ethanol (0.78) and for glycerol (0.54) (7Pionnier S. Robins R. Zhang B.-L. J. Agric. Food. Chem. 2003; 51: 2076-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A value of Cf <1 can arise either by a dilution effect, as occurs for the glucose-H2 position, or because of a sensitivity to 2H at a key step in lactic acid biosynthesis. The latter will lead to positive discrimination against 2H (i.e. KIE >1). KIEs for l-lactate dehydrogenase have been described both for the binding (20LaReau R. Wan W. Anderson V. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3619-3624Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and the catalytic (21Thomson J. Darling J. Bordner L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 85: 177-185PubMed Google Scholar) steps of pyruvate reduction. Hence, selectivity against 2H is probable, leading to the observed diminished transfer. In contrast, for the CH3 no apparent selectivity against 2H has occurred. Two of the three hydrogens in this position are derived directly from the 6,6′-Hs of glucose without any reaction. Alternatively, these positions are derived from the H1 position without reaction and the H2 position with intramolecular transfer by glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (EC5.3.1.9). It would appear that this enzyme shows little sensitivity to 2H. The third hydrogen in the CH3 is derived from water, without any apparent KIE. Ln. mesenteroides—The deuterium content of lactic acid isolated from the fermentation of glucose with Ln. mesenteroides is summarized in Table III. These data show that the transfer of deuterium from the glucose to the lactic acid is site-specific, varies with the position j of the substrate, and the affiliations do not have the same relationship as obtained with Lc. lactis. From the data in Table III, the Equations 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 are obtained. (D/H)CH3=0.25(D/H)m+78.9(Eq. 11) (D/H)CH=0.36(D/H)m+88.8(Eq. 12) (D/H)CH3=0.07(D/H)1+103.0(Eq. 13) (D/H)CH3=0.32(D/H)6,6′+68.7(Eq. 14) (D/H)CH=0.18(D/H)1+111.0(Eq. 15) (D/H)CH=0.38(D/H)3+86.9(Eq. 16) Isotope transfer coefficients for both positions with (D/H)2 and (D/H)4, for (D/H)CH3 with (D/H)3, and for (D/H)CH with (D/H)6,6′ are all non-significant. From Equations 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, the Cf values of each hydrogen to the CH3 or CH(OH) of d-lactic acid produced by Ln. mesenteroides can be estimated. Because during RPP metabolism, in contrast to glycolysis, nRH totally proteated glucose molecules are converted to only nRH molecules of lactic acid, Glucose(H)nRH→1lactic acid(H)+ 1 nRHacetyl−P+1CO2Reaction II then nRD site-j monodeuterated glucose molecules are converted to CfnRD site-i monodeuterated lactic acid molecules. Values calculated for Cf are given in Table II. Major differences and some similarities are observed when comparing these transfer coefficients to those obtained with Lc. lactis. According to the fermentation pathway in Ln. mesenteroides, the C5-C6 portion of glucose follows an affiliation pathway that should differ little from that of glycolysis, because their metabolism takes place post-G3P formation (Fig. 3). This is confirmed by the data for the H6,6′, with a Cf = 0.95, indicating that these hydrogens remain attached to the C6 throughout. Although the glucose C4 might also be seen to follow the same pathway, the data show no affiliation between H4 and d-lactic acid (Tables II, III), suggesting that the glucose-H4 is not transferred to NAD+ during the action of G3P dehydrogenase (EC1.2.1.12). This is explained by the isomerization of ribulose-5-P to xylulose-5-P by the reversible enzyme, ribulose-5-P 3-epimerase (EC5.1.3.1) (Fig. 3, step 4). It has been shown by isotopic labeling that the inversion of configuration at the 3 position of the pentose involves a two-base mechanism, because the hydrogen at position 3 of the product, xylulose-5-P, is derived from water (22McDonough M.W. Wood W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1220-1224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Davis L. Lee N. Glaser L. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 5862-5866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C1-C2-C3 moiety of glucose is metabolized quite differently by the two pathways. In the RPP route, H1 and H3 are both transferred to NAD(P)+, whereas the H2 remains attached to the C2 and, consequently, does not participate in lactic acid formation. This is confirmed because aCH3,2 and aCH,2 are both zero. Rather, H2 should be recovered in the metabolites derived from acetyl-P, ethanol, and acetate (Figs. 1 and 3). Theoretically, the reduction of pyruvate to lactate could introduce hydrogen from H1 and H3 of glucose into the CH(OH). This is confirmed because both aCH,1 and aCH,3 are high, showing Cf values somewhat higher than that for aCH,4 in Lc. lactis (Table II) or for aCH,4 in ethanol and glycerol biosynthesis (7Pionnier S. Robins R. Zhang B.-L. J. Agric. Food. Chem. 2003; 51: 2076-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Because d-lactate dehydrogenase (EC1.1.1.28), at least from Lactobacillus plantarum (10Dennis D. Kaplan N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 810-818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is inactive with NADPH, all reoxidation of any NADPH produced by G6P 1-dehydrogenase (EC1.1.1.49) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (EC3.1.1.31) requires conversion to NADH by transhydrogenase activity. Thus, the 2-fold difference between aCH,1 (0.18) and aCH,3 (0.38) could be explained by different affinities of these two dehydrogenases for NAD+ and NADP+. It has been demonstrated that, for the enzymes of Ln. mesenteroides, the cofactor selectivity of G6P dehydrogenase for NAD+/NADP+ = 0.67, whereas the selectivity of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase is 25-fold in favor of NAD+ (24DeMoss R. Methods Enzymol. 1955; 1: 328-334Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Hence, the differences in H1-Cf and H3-Cf can readily be explained by differential loss of 2H to the medium during transhydrogenation. The observed significant Cf for glucose-H1 and the CH3 of lactate is, in contrast, intriguing. For the RPP pathway, no such affiliation should occur, suggesting that this could arise because of low activity of another metabolic route. One possibility is that limited glycolysis occurs at a level sufficient to observe the small a1,CH3 but insufficient to observe the even smaller a2,CH3 that should be associated with it. Because a3,CH3 is zero, it is improbable that the H1 transfer is through NAD(P)H. The manipulation of flux to enhance or diminish the accumulation of particular target products is a major goal of biotechnology when applied to microbial fermentations. Lactic acid bacteria are no exception (25Hoefnagel M. Starrenburg M. Martens D. Hugenholtz J. Kleerebezem M. Van Swam I. Bongers R. Westerhoff H. Snoep J. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 1003-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), but it is evident that the exact manipulation required to optimize the desired effect is not always easily defined. In part, this is because of the difficulty of predicting the influence of metabolic regulation. Metabolic flux control studies have made some progress toward fully describing how glucose metabolism in Lc. lactis is controlled (26Koebmann B. Andersen H. Solem C. Jensen P. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 2002; 82: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 27Neves A. Ventura R. Mansour N. Shearman C. Gasson M. Maycock C. Ramos A. Santos H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28088-28098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In particular, it is apparent that down-regulation of one route, such as lactate dehydrogenation for NAD+ regeneration, is likely to elicit several alternative metabolic strategies (4Monnet C. Aymes F. Corrieu G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 5518-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), not all of which are desirable. Furthermore, different routes can lead to the same end product; for example, acetate and lactate can both be produced by the glycolytic and RPP pathways (Fig. 1). Quantifying the relative contribution of each route under conditions in which both alternatives are active can be problematic."

IntroductionCirculating neutrophils are activated by a variety of stimuli that induce chemotaxis, chemokinesis, phagocytosis, release of proteases, and production of superoxide anions (1Snyderman R. Uhing R.J. Gallin J.I. Goldstein I.M. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. Raven Press, New York, NY1992: 421-439Google Scholar, 2Stossel T.P. Gallin J.I. Goldstein I.M. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. Raven Press, New York, NY1992: 459-475Google Scholar). G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein coupled receptor; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases; PK, protein kinase; fMLP, formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine; BAPTA-AM, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; PtdIns(3,4)P2, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate; PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; PH, pleckstrin homology; GM-CSF; granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. play a major role in the regulation of these cellular functions by recognizing chemoattractants released by invading bacteria and cytokines released by tissue cells and various cells of the immune system (1Snyderman R. Uhing R.J. Gallin J.I. Goldstein I.M. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. Raven Press, New York, NY1992: 421-439Google Scholar, 3Luster A.D. New Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 436-445Google Scholar). The signaling pathways initiated by ligated GPCRs are divided into two major groups: one group controls cellular chemotaxis and is dependent upon kinase activity of the class IA phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K) (4Li Z. Jiang H. Xie W. Zhang Z. Smrcka A.V. Wu D. Science. 2000; 287: 1046-1049Google Scholar), whereas the other controls the release of proteases and production of superoxide anions (5Haribabu B. Zhelev D.V. Pridgen B.C. Richardson R.M. Ali H. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37087-37092Google Scholar) and is dependent upon the activity of phospholipase Cβ2 (4Li Z. Jiang H. Xie W. Zhang Z. Smrcka A.V. Wu D. Science. 2000; 287: 1046-1049Google Scholar). PI3Ks and their products play key roles in the signaling of chemotaxis (6Weiner O.D. Servant G. Welch M.D. Mitchison T.J. Sedat J.W. Bourne H.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 75-81Google Scholar, 7Wang F. Herzmark P. Weiner O.D. Srinivasan S. Servant G. Bourne H.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 513-518Google Scholar); however, there are alternative pathways of chemotaxis that do not require PI3K activation (8Chodniewicz D. Zhelev D.V.

Cell. 2002; 108: 809-821Google Scholar). Both PI3K-dependent and -independent signaling of chemotaxis are dependent upon tyrosine kinase activation, which modulates the GPCR-mediated activation by means of receptor tyrosine kinases (9Chodniewicz D. Zhelev D.V. Blood. 2003; 102: 2251-2258Google Scholar), intracellular tyrosine kinases (12Xu J. Wang F. Keymeulen A.V. Herzmark P. Straight A. Kelly K. Takuwa Y. Sugimoto N. Mitchison T. Bourne H.R. Cell. 2003; 114: 201-214Google Scholar), or both (13Rane M.J. Coxon P.Y. Powell D.W. Webster R. Klein J.B. Pierce W. Ping P. McLeish K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3517-3523Google Scholar, 14Heit B. Tavener S. Raharjo E. Kubes P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 91-102Google Scholar). The complexity of the signaling of neutrophil chemotaxis is essential for the functioning of the cells during innate immune responses, and its further elucidation will allow for better control over the immune responses in pathology and disease.It is widely accepted that chemotaxis is intimately related to signaling of F-actin polymerization in the lamellae region (15Pollard T.D. Blanchoin L. Mullins R.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 545-576Google Scholar, 16Katanaev V.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 66: 351-368Google Scholar, 17Zhelev D.V. Alteraifi A. Annals Biomed. Eng. 2002; 30: 356-370Google Scholar) and generation of a protrusive force by newly formed cytoskeleton structures (18Herant M. Marganski W.A. Dembo M. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 3389-3413Google Scholar, 19Cameron L.A. Svitkina T.M. Vignjevic D. Theriot J.A. Borisy G.G. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 130-135Google Scholar, 20Mogilner A. Oster G. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 3030-3045Google Scholar, 21Mogilner A. Oster G. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 1591-1605Google Scholar). Although the origin of the protrusive force is still being debated (18Herant M. Marganski W.A. Dembo M. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 3389-3413Google Scholar, 22Upadhyaya A. Oudenaarden A.V. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: R734-R744Google Scholar), it is recognized that signaling of F-actin dynamics plays a critical role in chemotaxis (23Borisy G.G. Svitkina T.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 104-112Google Scholar). The dynamics of a rearranging cytoskeleton is dependent upon the spatial and temporal localization of a variety of signaling molecules, some of which localize to the leading lamellae and others to the uropod (24Caroni P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4332-4336Google Scholar, 25Laux T. Fukami K. Thelen M. Golub T. Frey D. Caroni P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1455-1472Google Scholar, 26Pierini L.M. Eddy R.J. Fuortes M. Seveau S. Casulo C. Maxfield F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10831-10841Google Scholar). The role of spatial and temporal signaling in chemotaxis is not yet completely understood; however, the molecules that localize to the leading lamella seem to control actin polymerization to form a highly branched cytoskeleton network (the “dendritic” model for F-actin polymerization) (15Pollard T.D. Blanchoin L. Mullins R.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 545-576Google Scholar, 23Borisy G.G. Svitkina T.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 104-112Google Scholar). The involvement of localized molecules in the signaling of F-actin polymerization induces the formation of almost cylindrical pseudopods when chemoattractant is delivered to a small surface region of a non-adherent cell with micropipets (27Zhelev D.V. Alteraifi A.M. Hochmuth R.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1996; 35: 331-344Google Scholar). The addition of new filaments to the F-actin network at the tip of the pseudopod results in the extension of pseudopod length without a significant change in pseudopod thickness. Thus, the measurement of the rate of pseudopod extension in different experimental conditions is expected to provide valuable information for the dynamics of chemoattractant-induced F-actin polymerization (8Chodniewicz D. Zhelev D.V. Blood. 2003; 101: 1181-1184Google Scholar, 9Chodniewicz D. Zhelev D.V. Blood. 2003; 102: 2251-2258Google Scholar, 27Zhelev D.V. Alteraifi A.M. Hochmuth R.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1996; 35: 331-344Google Scholar).The key role of cellular kinases, such as the class IA PI3Ks (4Li Z. Jiang H. Xie W. Zhang Z. Smrcka A.V. Wu D. Science. 2000; 287: 1046-1049Google Scholar), Akt/PKB, or PKC (28Laudanna C. Mochly-Rosen D. Liron T. Constantin G. Butcher E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30306-30315Google Scholar), in chemotaxis suggests that the polymerization of F-actin induced with chemoattractant may be limited by the rates of involved enzymatic reactions. Here, we explore this possibility by characterizing the temperature dependence of the rate of pseudopod extension in the presence of pharmacological inhibitors that either affect key components of the reaction of F-actin polymerization or modulate PI3K activity and downstream PI3K-dependent signaling events.The overall rate of enzymatic chain reactions is often determined by a rate-limiting or bottleneck reaction, which simplifies the analysis of reaction kinetics (29Meyer E.L. Gahring L.C. Rogers S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10869-10875Google Scholar, 30Truhlar D.G. Kohen A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 848-851Google Scholar). In many cases, the overall reaction rate has a simple temperature dependence that is described by the van Hoff-Arrhenius (or Arrhenius) relationship (30Truhlar D.G. Kohen A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 848-851Google Scholar), k=Ae−EaRT(Eq. 1) where k is the rate of the enzymatic process, A is pre-exponential factor, Ea is barrier energy, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature.Many of the individual processes involved in cytoskeleton rearrangement have been described in terms of Arrhenius relations (30Truhlar D.G. Kohen A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 848-851Google Scholar, 31Alteraifi A.M. Zhelev D.V. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1967-1977Google Scholar, 32Xu C. Watras J. Loew L.M. J.

Chua N.-H. Carlier M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12302-12309Google Scholar), which suggest the possibility for a simple temperature dependence of the overall process of pseudopod extension. Here we use a phenomenological approach, in which the temperature dependencies of two recently identified pathways of pseudopod extension, the PI3K-dependent and PI3K-independent pathways (8Chodniewicz D. Zhelev D.V. Blood. 2003; 101: 1181-1184Google Scholar, 9Chodniewicz D. Zhelev D.V. Blood. 2003; 102: 2251-2258Google Scholar), are assumed to obey the Arrhenius law, and the PI3K-independent pathway is assumed to have a negligible contribution to the overall process of F-actin polymerization. These conditions are met for pseudopod extension stimulated with fMLP, where 80% of the rate of pseudopod extension at 37 °C is PI3K-dependent (8Chodniewicz D. Zhelev D.V. Blood. 2003; 101: 1181-1184Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Preparation—Human neutrophils were freshly isolated as described elsewhere (9Chodniewicz D. Zhelev D.V. Blood. 2003; 102: 2251-2258Google Scholar). Briefly, whole blood was obtained by venipuncture from consenting, healthy adult volunteers (mean age 29 ± 9.5 years) into Vacutainers anticoagulated with K2EDTA. Neutrophils were isolated by a one-step density gradient (Polymorphoprep, Nycomed, Oslo, Norway) centrifugation at 500 × g for 35 min at 23 °C. The neutrophil fraction was collected and washed once with Ca2+/Mg2+-containing Hanks' balanced salt solution (Sigma). The cells were resuspended in an autologous plasma/Hanks' balanced salt solution (1:3, v/v) and added to the manipulation chamber filled with the same solution. Microscopic evaluation of isolated cells indicated that 95% of the cells were neutrophils and >98% viable, as measured by trypan blue dye exclusion. Approval for these studies was obtained from the Institutional Review Board at Duke University.Incubation with Inhibitors—The used inhibitors were initially diluted in either ethanol or dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) at a maximum final concentration of 0.8% or 0.2% respectively. The presence of ethanol or Me2SO had no measurable effect on the rates of pseudopod extension (data not shown). Cells were incubated with or without inhibitors at room temperature (23 °C) using the following concentrations and times of incubation: latrunculin A (1 nm for 30 min; Biomol Research Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA), cytochalasin D (1 μm for 45 min; Biomol Research Laboratories), PIP-binding peptide (Ac-Lys(Dansyl)-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gln-Arg-Leu-Phe-Gln-Val-Lys-Gly-Arg-Arg; 10 μm for 30 min), 2The peptide was synthesized in the University of North Carolina Microprotein Sequencing and Peptide Synthesis Facility, Chapel Hill, NC. Its molecular weight and purity were confirmed with mass spectrometry. 1L-6-hydroxymethyl-chiro-inositol 2-(R)-2-O-methyl-3-O-octadecylcarbonate (Akt-inhibitor; 10 μm for 60 min; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), wortmannin (100–1000 nm for 15 min; Sigma), chelerythrine chloride (2.5 μm for 30 min; Biomol Research Laboratories), and 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA-AM; 75 μm for 45 min; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR).Micromanipulation—Micromanipulation was performed in a temperature-controlled 2-mm thick chamber, which allowed for cell micromanipulation from two axially inserted micropipets. Micropipets were made from capillary glass tubing (A-M Systems Inc., Everett, WA) pulled with a vertical pipette puller (David Kopf Instruments Model 730, Tujunga, CA). The tip of the pipettes were cut using a microforge and connected to a manometer system, which allowed for precise delivery of chemoattractant by controlling the pipette-chamber pressure difference. The temperature of the experimental chamber was varied by a flow of thermostated water at the top of the chamber. The temperature in the viewing area was measured with a thermocouple.In the experiments of pseudopod extension, a single, passive neutrophil with a smooth membrane surface and uniform optical density was chosen. The cell was held in a supporting pipette with a 5-μm internal diameter. Another pipette with an internal diameter of 1 μm was filled with a solution of N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (Sigma) and positioned 1 μm from the cell surface. The chemoattractant solution was blown over the cell, which initiated the extension of a single pseudopod (27Zhelev D.V. Alteraifi A.M. Hochmuth R.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1996; 35: 331-344Google Scholar). In the experiments of F-actin polymerization along membrane tethers, tethers were pulled from single, passive neutrophils using latex beads with conjugated CD18 mAb (BD Biosciences) (31Alteraifi A.M. Zhelev D.V. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1967-1977Google Scholar). Pseudopod extension or advancement of a pseudopod-like structure along tethers was observed by using an inverted Nikon microscope equipped with a 60× oil-immersion objective. The microscope images were recorded using a charge-coupled device camera (Cohu, San Diego, CA). A real-time counter and the chamber temperature were multiplexed onto the recorded images using a multiplexer (Vista Electronics, La Mesa, CA). The recorded images were analyzed with Metamorph Imaging software (Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA), and the rate of pseudopod extension was calculated from the measured pseudopod lengths and time lapses. Approximately 90% of the neutrophils tested produced pseudopods. The non-responding fraction of cells is not reported in the averages of the rates of pseudopod extension.RESULTSPseudopod Extension Induced by Chemoattractant Delivered from a Micropipet—The micropipet assay for pseudopod extension from non-adherent cells used a steep chemoattractant gradient to stimulate F-actin polymerization at a local region of the cell and to induce a single pseudopod growth. 3Zhelev, D. V., Alteraifi, A. M., and Chodniewicz, D. (2004) Biophys. J., in press. This results in several distinct characteristics of formation of these pseudopods including: (i) the existence of a time of delay between the beginning of chemoattractant delivery and initial pseudopod growth (Fig. 1); (ii) the stimulation of shape change only in the pseudopod region, which was observed as an increase in pseudopod length (Fig. 1); (iii) the continuous increase of pseudopod length until a maximum length was reached, after which the growth of the pseudopod stopped abruptly and its length started to decrease; (iv) the repetitive pseudopod extension and retraction until the delivery of chemoattractant was continued. We have shown that the extension and the retraction of the pseudopod in the presence of chemoattractant is actively regulated and is dependent upon the activity of the small GTPase RhoA and its downstream effector kinase ROCK. 3Zhelev, D. V., Alteraifi, A. M., and Chodniewicz, D. (2004) Biophys. J., in press. These observations show that the overall process of pseudopod growth over an extended period of time is an actively regulated multiphase process. Therefore, we focused our measurements on the initial pseudopod extension, which was linear in time (Fig. 1) and, therefore, was most probably dependent upon a single rate-limiting process. The linear increase of the pseudopod growth was independent of the treatment with pharmacological inhibitors (Fig. 1), which showed that the rate of pseudopod extension induced with the micropipet assay provides information for the dynamics of cytoskeleton rearrangement in the presence of inhibitors. In the following sections, we examine the dependence of the rate of pseudopod extension upon temperature in the presence of different inhibitors.Changing Substrate ConcentrationSequestering G-actin with Latrunculin A and Capping F-actin Filaments with Cytochalasin D—Actin in human neutrophils is subject to continuous turnover, where actin monomers are shuttled between G-actin and F-actin. G-actin in the neutrophil is sequestered by either profilin (33Southwick F. Young C. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1965-1973Google Scholar) or thymosin-β4 (34Cassimeris L. Safer D. Nachmias V. Zigmond S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1261-1270Google Scholar). Profilin, a nucleotide exchange factor (35Wolven A.K. Belmont L.D. Mahoney N.M. Almo S.C. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 895-904Google Scholar, 36Perelroizen I. Didry D. Christensen H. Chua N.-H. Carlier M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12302-12309Google Scholar), recovers the ADP-bound actin after its release during cofilin-assisted severing of F-actin filaments (37Maciver S.K. Pope B.J. Whytock S. Weeds A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 388-397Google Scholar). Profilin mediates the formation of ATP-actin, which is then added to free F-actin barbed ends (38Carlier M.-F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.-X. Hong Y. Chua N.-H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Google Scholar). The overall rate of F-actin polymerization is dependent upon both the availability of actin for polymerization and the availability of free filament ends where the ATP-actin is polymerized (15Pollard T.D. Blanchoin L. Mullins R.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 545-576Google Scholar).Latrunculin A binds actin with high affinity, thereby inhibiting the binding of thymosin-β4 (39Yarmola E.G. Somasundaram T. Boring T.A. Spector I. Bubb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28120-28127Google Scholar). The identification of the binding site of latrunculin A to actin revealed that it is also near the binding site for nucleotide (40Morton W.M. Ayscough K.R. McLaughlin P.J. Nat. Cell. Bio. 2000; 2: 376-378Google Scholar). Therefore, latrunculin A blocks nucleotide binding to actin while simultaneously blocking profilin-mediated nucleotide exchange (41Ayscough K.R. Stryker J. Pokala N. Sanders M. Crews P. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 399-416Google Scholar). The ability of latrunculin A to prevent both sequestering of actin by thymosin-β4 and binding of nucleotide to actin makes it a good sequestering agent for G-actin. The incubation of neutrophils with 10 nm latrunculin A decreased the rate of pseudopod extension without significantly affecting the apparent barrier energy for pseudopod formation (Fig. 2A). Cytochalasin D, which blocks free barbed ends of F-actin (42Cooper J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1473-1478Google Scholar), was also expected to decrease the overall rate of F-actin polymerization. Similar to latrunculin A, the incubation of the cells with 1 μm cytochalasin D decreased the rate of pseudopod extension without significantly affecting the barrier energy of pseudopod extension (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2Effect of changing substrate concentration on the rate of pseudopod extension. A, sequestering of cellular G-actin with 10 nm latrunculin A (•), blocking of free actin filament ends with 1 μm cytochalasin D (▪), or sequestering PtdIns lipids with 10 μm PIP-binding peptide (▴) decreased the rate of pseudopod extension without significantly affecting the slope of the Arrhenius plot of the experimental data. B, the rate of pseudopod extension increased with increasing chemoattractant concentration until a concentration of saturation was reached. The increase of the rate of pseudopod extension occurred without changes of the slopes of the Arrhenius plots.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Sequestering Phosphatidylinositide Lipids with PIP-binding Peptide—Phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) are two main downstream messengers of PI3K-dependent signaling (7Wang F. Herzmark P. Weiner O.D. Srinivasan S. Servant G. Bourne H.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 513-518Google Scholar, 43Bokoch G.M. Blood. 1995; 86: 1649-1660Google Scholar). PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is synthesized from PtdIns(4,5)P2 (44Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Google Scholar) and is a pivotal downstream regulator of cellular chemotaxis (45Weiner O.D. Neilsen P.O. Prestwich G.D. Kirschner M.W. Cantley L.C. Bourne H.R. Nat. Cell. Bio. 2002; 4: 509-513Google Scholar). The cell-permeable peptide Ac-Gln-Arg-Leu-Phe-Gln-Val-Lys-Gly-Arg-Arg (PIP-binding peptide), synthesized after the binding domain for PtdIns(4,5)P2 of gelsolin (46Xian W. Vegners R. Janmey P. Braunlin W. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 2695-2702Google Scholar), has been used successfully to inhibit F-actin polymerization and arrest cell migration (47Cunningham C.C. Vegners R. Bucki R. Funaki M. Korde N. Hartwig J.H. Stossel T.P. Janmey P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43390-43399Google Scholar). The specificity of this peptide for binding different phosphatidylinositides has not been characterized; however, it sequesters PtdIns(4,5)P2 with high efficiency (47Cunningham C.C. Vegners R. Bucki R. Funaki M. Korde N. Hartwig J.H. Stossel T.P. Janmey P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43390-43399Google Scholar). The incubation of neutrophils with 10 μm PIP-binding peptide decreased the rate of pseudopod extension at 37 °C more than two times compared with control, without affecting the slopes of the Arrhenius plots, which are a measure of the apparent barrier energy for pseudopod extension (Fig. 2A).Effect of Chemoattractant Concentration—We have shown that the rate of pseudopod extension is dependent upon chemoattractant concentration at room temperature and at 37 °C (9Chodniewicz D. Zhelev D.V. Blood. 2003; 102: 2251-2258Google Scholar, 31Alteraifi A.M. Zhelev D.V. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1967-1977Google Scholar). The increase of chemoattractant concentration increases the number of ligand-bound GPCRs and was expected to increase the apparent concentration of downstream substrates synthesized after receptor activation. The measurement of the rate of pseudopod extension for increasing concentrations of chemoattractant showed that the rate of pseudopod extension increased without a change in the barrier energy for pseudopod extension (Fig. 2B).Reducing the Apparent Concentration of Activated Enzyme with Competitively Binding Substrates—Downstream effectors of PI3K activation include pleckstrin homology (PH) domain proteins, which bind 3′-phosphorylated lipids. Akt/protein kinase B (Akt/PKB) is a major downstream regulator of PI3K-dependent chemotaxis (7Wang F. Herzmark P. Weiner O.D. Srinivasan S. Servant G. Bourne H.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 513-518Google Scholar, 8Chodniewicz D. Zhelev D.V. Blood. 2003; 101: 1181-1184Google Scholar, 48Servant G. Weiner O.D. Herzmark P. Balla T. Sedat J.W. Bourne H.R. Science. 2000; 287: 1037-1040Google Scholar, 49Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Google Scholar). Akt/PKB binds both PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2, resulting in its recruitment to the plasma membrane and its phosphorylation at specific residues, Thr308 and Ser473 (50Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 1-13Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at Ser473 is an indicator of Akt/PKB activation, and phosphorylation of this amino acid is a prerequisite for Akt/PKB activity (51Hill M.M. Feng J. Hemmings B.A. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1251-1255Google Scholar). We used the phosphatidylinositol ether analog 1L-6-hydroxymethylchiro-inositol 2-(R)-2-O-methyl-3-O-octadecylcarbonate (Akt-inhibitor) to competitively bind and reduce the total available Akt/PKB for activation by 3′-phosphorylated lipids (52Hu Y. Qiao L. Wang S. Rong S. Meuillet E.J. Berggren M. Gakeros A. Powis G. Kozikowski A.P. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 3045-3051Google Scholar). The specificity of the Akt-inhibitor has not been tested thoroughly; however, it has been shown that in the human myelocytic leukemic cell line, HL-60, 40 μm Akt-inhibitor blocked Ser473-Akt phosphorylation without affecting the phosphorylation and activity of PKC-ζ and had a minimum effect upon the production of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (53Martelli A.M. Tazzari P.L. Tabelini G. Bortul R. Billi A.M. Manzoli L. Ruggeri A. Conte R. Cocco L. Leukemia. 2003; 17: 1794-1805Google Scholar). PKC together with Akt/PKB have been identified as downstream effectors of PI3K activity in the signaling of pseudopod extension (8Chodniewicz D. Zhelev D.V. Blood. 2003; 101: 1181-1184Google Scholar) and chemotaxis (28Laudanna C. Mochly-Rosen D. Liron T. Constantin G. Butcher E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30306-30315Google Scholar). Therefore, at least for the signaling of pseudopod extension, the effect of Akt-inhibitor is considered to be blocking Akt/PKB activation. We tested the effect of Akt-inhibitor on the rate of pseudopod extension, Akt/PKB phosphorylation, and on PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 production (see supplemental material). The effect of Akt-inhibitor on the rate of pseudopod extension was similar to the effect of wortmannin. 40 μm Akt-inhibitor was sufficient to block PI3K-dependent pseudopod extension and almost completely block Ser473-Akt phosphorylation, while having only a minor effect upon PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 production (see supplemental material). These findings suggest that the Akt-inhibitor has a similar effect upon neutrophil activation as upon the activation of HL-60 cells. The incubation of neutrophils with 10 μm Akt-inhibitor decreased the rate of pseudopod extension, without affecting the barrier energy for pseudopod growth (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Effect of blocking enzyme activation on the rate of pseudopod extension. The binding of PtdIns lipids to Akt/PKB and the activation of the enzyme were blocked with the competitively binding inhibitor 1L-6-hydroxymethyl-chiro-inositol 2-(R)-2-O-methyl-3-O-octadecylcarbonate (Akt-inhibitor). The blocking of enzymatic activity decreased the rate of pseudopod extension without affecting the slope of the Arrhenius plots.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Reducing Enzyme ActivityReducing PI3K Activity with Wortm"
https://openalex.org/W2142004058,"We have investigated peptides corresponding to the complete transmembrane region of both proto-oncogenic (Val664) and mutant (Glu664) forms of the receptor Neu in detergent micelles by NMR and CD spectroscopy. Both forms of the peptide appear to adopt similar levels of helicity and dimeric interactions based on the analysis of CD spectra and nuclear Overhauser effect connectivity profiles. There are considerable differences in the chemical shifts of amide and, to a lesser extent, CHα resonances between the two forms of the peptides, and these differences are most pronounced in residues upstream of the mutation site and close to the N terminus of the transmembrane domain. Similarly, there are substantial differences in the amide hydrogen-deuterium exchange rates for residues close to and upstream of the mutation site; amide protons in this region of the protooncogenic peptide are much more resistant to exchange than those in the mutant form. In both molecules, residues downstream of the mutation site exhibit slow exchange. We therefore demonstrate that, although transmembrane Neu peptides exhibit similar levels of secondary structure when dispersed in detergent, there are detectable differences in their adopted micellar states that may provide insight into the dimer-promoting ability of the polar transforming mutation.

The catalytic activation of members of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) 1The abbreviations used are: RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; TM, transmembrane; TFE, trifluoroethanol; DPC, dodecylphosphocholine; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; CSD, chemical shift deviation from random coil value. family is generally initiated by ligand binding to the extracellular domain of a monovalent receptor that promotes dimerization, a process mediated by residues in both the extracellular and transmembrane (TM) domains. Receptor dimerization enables the trans-phosphorylation of the intracellular domain of the partner receptor and the recruitment of signaling proteins, leading to the appropriate downstream cellular response. In Neu, the rat homologue of ErbB2 (a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor subfamily), a single oncogenic mutation (Val664 → Glu) within the TM domain enhances receptor dimerization, leading to constitutive activation (1Bargmann C.I. Hung M.C. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1986; 45: 649-657Google Scholar, 2Bargmann C.I. Weinberg R.A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2043-2052Google Scholar, 3Weiner D.B. Liu J. Cohen J.A. Williams W.V. Greene M.I. Nature. 1989; 339: 230-231Google Scholar). Substitution of the mutant TM domain from Neu into other RTKs increases catalytic activity and promotes cellular transformation (4Cheatham B. Shoelson S.E. Yamada K. Goncalves E. Kahn C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7336-7340Google Scholar, 5Petti L.M. Irusta P.M. DiMaio D. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 843-851Google Scholar, 6Wides R.J. Zak N.B. Shilo B.Z. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 189: 637-645Google Scholar), demonstrating that there is a common role played by this segment in the activation process. The TM domain of Neu, along with its associated transforming mutation, has become a useful paradigm with which to clarify the role played by the single helical domain in the activation of RTKs. Recent studies have demonstrated that the presence of polar residues within TM domains can, in principle, promote helix-helix association by providing an additional interhelical stabilizing force acting as both an H-bond donor and acceptor (7Choma C. Gratkowski H. Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 161-166Google Scholar, 8Zhou F.X. Cocco M.J. Russ W.P. Brunger A.T. Engelman D.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 154-160Google Scholar, 9Zhou F.X. Merianos H.J. Brunger A.T. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2250-2255Google Scholar). The transforming mutation in the receptor Neu occurs within a five-residue dimerization motif that has been identified in the majority of RTKs (10Sternberg M.J. Gullick W.J. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 245-248Google Scholar). The local structure, dictated by the primary sequence in the motif, is critical for proper receptor dimerization and activation; replacing residues adjacent to the transforming mutation site with glutamate does not elicit the same behavior (2Bargmann C.I. Weinberg R.A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2043-2052Google Scholar, 11Cao H. Bangalore L. Bormann B.J. Stern D.F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 923-932Google Scholar). Furthermore, upon activation there appears to be important coupling between the kinase domain in the intracellular region of the receptor and the contact point of the helices within the dimer structure (12Bell C.A. Tynan J.A. Hart K.C. Meyer A.N. Robertson S.C. Donoghue D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3589-3599Google Scholar, 13Chen L.I. Webster M.K. Meyer A.N. Donoghue D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 619-631Google Scholar). Thus, the harmful transforming property of the mutation arises not only because it promotes helix-helix association but because it occurs within the context of a dimerization motif. Using peptides corresponding to the TM region of mutant Neu reconstituted in lipid bilayers, Smith and colleagues (14Smith S.O. Smith C.S. Bormann B.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 252-258Google Scholar) have characterized the dimeric structure at residues close to the mutation site. They determined that the side chain carboxyl group of Glu664 is likely protonated and is a participant in an interhelical hydrogen bond (14Smith S.O. Smith C.S. Bormann B.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 252-258Google Scholar). Solid state NMR measurements indicated that there is close association between the side chain carboxyl group of Glu664 and the α-carbon atom of Gly665 of the partner helix (15Smith S.O. Smith C. Shekar S. Peersen O. Ziliox M. Aimoto S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9321-9332Google Scholar). These measurements led to a proposed dimer model that was symmetric and possessed a right-handed crossing angle. The elucidation of the structure of membrane proteins is a significant challenge because of the technical difficulties associated with their study using techniques such as NMR spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography. It is for this reason that a complete structural picture of the TM domain of Neu in a lipid environment remains elusive. Several lines of evidence suggest that structural details not necessarily confined to the mutation site in the TM domain may offer insight into the process of receptor activation. Molecular dynamics studies of ErbB2/Neu TM peptides, performed in vacuo, have suggested the possibility that portions of this domain may readily adopt π-helix turns capable of reorienting residues found at the dimer interface (16Duneau J.P. Garnier N. Genest M. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1997; 15: 555-572Google Scholar, 17Sajot N. Genest M. Eur. Biophys. J. 2000; 28: 648-662Google Scholar, 18Sajot N. Genest M. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 2001; 19: 15-31Google Scholar). Solvent structures of both proto-oncogenic and mutant forms of the TM domain have displayed helical distortions downstream of the mutation site (19Goetz M. Carlotti C. Bontems F. Dufourc E.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6534-6540Google Scholar, 20Houliston R.S. Hodges R.S. Sharom F.J. Davis J.H. FEBS Lett. 2003; 535: 39-43Google Scholar). Therefore, dimer models constructed using canonical α-helices may be overly simplistic. Wide line 2H-NMR spectral differences downstream of the mutation site have been observed between monomeric forms of proto-oncogenic and mutant Neu/ErbB2 peptides dispersed in bilayers (21Jones D.H. Ball E.H. Sharpe S. Barber K.R. Grant C.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1870-1878Google Scholar, 22Sharpe S. Barber K.R. Grant C.W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2341-2352Google Scholar). Also, a recent theoretical study has raised the possibility that the TM domain of the ErbB2 receptor may be capable of adopting two stable dimeric conformations that are interchangeable through a 120° rotation of the individual helices (23Fleishman S.J. Schlessinger J. Ben Tal N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15937-15940Google Scholar). Finally, it is still unclear whether the dimer-promoting ability of the transforming polar mutation in this large 185-kDa receptor is solely a function of the added H-bonding capability resulting from the presence of a glutamate side chain within the TM domain or whether there are additional structural or thermodynamic consequences resulting from its presence that contribute to enhanced receptor oligomerization. As an alternative to studying membrane proteins in their natural bilayer environment, detergent micelles are routinely employed to solubilize and characterize membrane-anchored proteins. Because of their relatively small size range, protein micellar complexes are amenable to investigation using standard solution state NMR techniques. In this report, we present a structural study of both proto-oncogenic and mutant peptides corresponding to the complete TM domain of Neu dispersed in detergent micelles. We have characterized the micelle-adopted states of the peptides using CD and NMR spectroscopy, and we present the banding pattern observed upon running them on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. We demonstrate that both forms of the peptide appear to form helical structures throughout the length of the putative TM region and that they adopt similar levels of interhelical interaction within the micelle environment. However, the transforming mutation causes an appreciable difference in the amide proton exchange rates in residues close to the mutation site and near the N-terminal juxtamembrane region. Synthesis of Peptides—A hydrophobicity profile of Neu suggests that its TM domain comprises 26 amino acids. The membrane flanking regions contain a proline residue at the N terminus and several basic residues at the C terminus. 36-residue peptides incorporating the entire putative TM domain and several residues from the flanking juxtamembrane regions of both proto-oncogenic and mutant Neu were synthesized using the tBOC strategy and purified by reversed-phase chromatography. The purity of the peptides, judged to be >90%, was confirmed by mass spectrometry. The sequence of the proto-oncogenic peptide, corresponding to the position of the amino acids within the Neu receptor, is Q651RASPVTFIIATVV664GVLLFLILVVVVGILIKRRRQK686. The mutant peptide has an identical sequence, except at position 664, where valine is replaced with glutamic acid. Within our peptides, the mutation site corresponds to residue 14. Heteronuclear NMR experiments were performed with 15N incorporated at six sites within the peptide backbone of both peptides, namely Val6, Ala11, Gly15, Phe19, Leu22, and Gly27. CD Spectroscopy—Spectra were acquired on an AVIV Model 215 instrument (AVIV Associates, Lakewood, NJ), using a 1-mm path length quartz cell at 25 °C in trifluoroethanol (TFE) and in SDS and dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles. The peptide concentration was ∼ 25 μm under all conditions. For samples in which peptides were dispersed in micelles, the detergent concentration was 100 mm. Helical content was estimated using either a deconvolution algorithm with the aid of the program CDNN (24Bohm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Google Scholar) or a method based on the molar ellipticity value at 222 nm ([Θ]222) as described by Chang et al. (25Chang C.T. Wu C.S. Yang J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 91: 13-31Google Scholar). NMR Spectroscopy—Approximately 3 mg (∼1.5 mm) of purified peptide was solubilized in 100 mm d38-DPC (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) at a solution pH of 4. To make the 1H assignments in this detergent, standard two-dimensional homonuclear correlation spectra were acquired at 50 °C on a Bruker Avance spectrometer operating at 600 MHz. Proton chemical shifts were referenced to the internal standard tetramethylsilane. Nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOESY) spectra with mixing times of 200, 250, and 300 ms were acquired using a presaturation pulse during the relaxation delay to suppress the H2O peak and a time-proportional phase increment (TPPI) for quadrature detection. We attempted to make the assignment of as many scalar coupled networks as possible with TOCSY spectra acquired using a DIPSI-2 pulse scheme (26Shaka A.J. Lee C.J. Pines A. J. Magn. Reson. 1988; 77: 274-293Google Scholar), isotropic mixing times of 30, 50, and 75 ms, solvent suppression using WATERGATE (27Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Google Scholar), and an echo-antiecho phase cycle for quadrature detection. All two-dimensional homonuclear spectra were acquired with 2048 points in the direct dimension, 256–512 points in the indirect dimension, and 128–256 scans per increment. The resolution obtained from the homonuclear spectra in detergent was not sufficient to enable the assignment of all of the backbone 1H resonances in either form of the peptide. To help resolve some of the ambiguities, we synthesized these molecules with 15N labels incorporated at six positions (see above). To assign the 1H and 15N resonances at these six sites, we performed standard 1H–15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra (28Kay L.E. Keifer P. Saarinen T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10663-10665Google Scholar), 15N-filtered NOESY spectra with mixing times of 250 and 300 ms (29Otting G. Senn H. Wagner G. Wuthrich K. J. Magn. Reson. 2004; 70: 500-505Google Scholar), and 1H–15N TOCSY-HSQC spectra with a mixing time of 75 ms. Solvent suppression was achieved using a presaturation pulse for the 15N-filtered NOESY spectra and water flip-back pulses for the 1H–15N HSQC and TOCSY-HSQC spectra. Once the 1H assignments at the labeled sites were made, we reanalyzed the two-dimensional homonuclear spectra and were able to assign the majority of the backbone and CHβ resonances within the helical portions of both peptides. All NMR data were processed using software Felix97 (Biosym) on an O2 work station (Silicon Graphics, Inc.). One final procedural note should be added regarding sample preparation for NMR experiments, i.e. when solubilizing these peptides in detergent, the sample was not subjected to a vortex but was gently resuspended using a pipette. We noticed that subjecting the samples to a vortex led to the loss of NMR signal, possibly because this promoted the aggregation of the peptides. Amide Exchange Experiments—Hexa-(15N)-labeled proto-oncogenic and mutant peptides (∼1.5 mm) were dispersed in 100 mm DPC at pH 4. The peptide/micelle solution was lyophilized and redissolved in D2O. Amide exchange rates were determined from the rate of decay in successive 1H–15N HSQC spectra acquired continuously over a 24-h time period at 40 °C. Roughly 20 min elapsed between redissolution in D2O and the acquisition of the first spectrum. Each time point took ∼ 60 and ∼ 75 min for the proto-oncogenic and mutant peptides, respectively. The decay constants were determined by integrating cross-peak volumes and fitting the data to a single exponential decay. The curve fitting was performed using the program Origin (version 6.1, Origin Lab Corporation). Gel Electrophoresis—Neu peptides were dissolved and incubated in standard loading buffer (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) at 42 °C for 30 min and run on a 16.5% Tris-tricine gel (31Schägger H. Schägger H. Von Jagow G. A Practical Guide to Membrane Protein Purification. Academic Press, San Diego1994Google Scholar). The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. There have been three reported NMR studies on peptides corresponding to the TM domain of Neu in solution, all in TFE (19Goetz M. Carlotti C. Bontems F. Dufourc E.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6534-6540Google Scholar, 20Houliston R.S. Hodges R.S. Sharom F.J. Davis J.H. FEBS Lett. 2003; 535: 39-43Google Scholar, 32Gullick W.J. Bottomley A.C. Lofts F.J. Doak D.G. Mulvey D. Newman R. Crumpton M.J. Sternberg M.J. Campbell I.D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 43-48Google Scholar). This is a popular membrane mimetic solvent used to characterize the secondary structure of TM protein fragments; however, because tertiary interactions are generally disrupted, this solvent could not be used to investigate, for instance, the dimeric structure of the peptides. The 1H-NMR-derived monomeric structures of proto-oncogenic and mutant forms of the Neu peptides were found to be very similar in TFE (20Houliston R.S. Hodges R.S. Sharom F.J. Davis J.H. FEBS Lett. 2003; 535: 39-43Google Scholar, 32Gullick W.J. Bottomley A.C. Lofts F.J. Doak D.G. Mulvey D. Newman R. Crumpton M.J. Sternberg M.J. Campbell I.D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 43-48Google Scholar). This contradicts an early theoretical investigation, which predicted that the favored conformation of the monomeric form of the proto-oncogenic receptor would be kinked at the mutation site, whereas the mutant form would adopt a canonical α-helix structure (33Brandt-Rauf P.W. Pincus M.R. Chen J.M. J. Protein Chem. 1989; 8: 749-756Google Scholar, 34Brandt-Rauf P.W. Rackovsky S. Pincus M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8660-8664Google Scholar). Solid-state NMR studies of Neu peptides in bilayers have also demonstrated that both forms of the receptor are likely helical at the mutation site, although these measurements were made on what were presumed to be dimeric forms of the peptides (15Smith S.O. Smith C. Shekar S. Peersen O. Ziliox M. Aimoto S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9321-9332Google Scholar). The heterogeneous nature of a micellar system reflects that of a lipid bilayer more accurately than do organic solvents and, consequently, is generally viewed as a more suitable membrane mimetic environment. Stable tertiary interactions can form in micelles, which enables the potential characterization of interhelical interactions between separate TM domains (35MacKenzie K.R. Prestegard J.H. Engelman D.M. Science. 1997; 276: 131-133Google Scholar), and, in cases where the protein/micelle complex remains relatively small, standard solution state NMR techniques can be applied to investigate both protein structure and dynamics. Several investigations of small membrane-associated proteins and TM fragments from larger proteins have been reported in micelles (reviewed in Ref. 36Damberg P. Jarvet J. Graslund A. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 271-285Google Scholar). The effectiveness of micellar systems for NMR studies of membrane proteins is often hindered, however, by poor resolution, spectra that are not generally reproducible, and peptide aggregation (reviewed in Ref. 37Opella S.J. Ma C. Marassi F.M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 285-313Google Scholar). CD Spectroscopy—The CD spectra of proto-oncogenic and mutant Neu peptides dispersed in SDS and DPC micelles are presented in Fig. 1; for comparative purposes, spectra obtained in the solvent TFE are included in the figure as well. In all three solution conditions, both forms of the peptide are predominantly α-helical, as was predicted by using both a deconvolution algorithm (24Bohm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Google Scholar) and the value of [Θ]222 (25Chang C.T. Wu C.S. Yang J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 91: 13-31Google Scholar). The predicted α-helical percentages are higher when a deconvolution algorithm was used than when the predictions were based on [Θ]222; helical estimates for the different solution conditions studied range from 75 to 85% when obtained using the former method versus 60 to 65% when using the latter. The NMR spectral resolution of both peptides in micelles was significantly improved at pH values close to 4, so we obtained CD profiles in micelles at both neutral and acidic pH. Within the error associated with the technique, the α-helical content of the peptides does not appear to change between pH 4 and 7. The degree of interaction between two helical peptides can be estimated by using CD spectroscopy based on the [Θ]222:[Θ]208 ratio; a value of 1 is expected for helices that are completely associated, whereas monomeric helices exhibit a ratio of 0.8 (38Lau S.Y. Taneja A.K. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13253-13261Google Scholar). An examination of the CD profiles reveals that there is a lower molar ellipticity at 208 nm in TFE than in micelles, which produces a different [Θ]222: [Θ]208 ratio in the two environments. The ratio is very close to 0.8 for both peptides in TFE, which is consistent with the notion that they exist predominantly as monomers in this solvent. In micelles, the [Θ]222: [Θ]208 ratio ranges between 0.85 and 0.9 for both forms of the peptide. This finding indicates that, within this environment, there is some level of association between the peptides. A comparison of the ratios obtained in micelles for the two peptides does not indicate that one form of the TM domain is more predisposed to dimeric interactions than the other. NMR Spectroscopy—Our analysis of the CD profiles suggests that both Neu peptides display similar levels of helicity and dimeric interactions in SDS and DPC micelles. We initially attempted to assign resonances to the Neu peptides dispersed in SDS micelles and, for this purpose, acquired spectra over a range of temperatures and solution pHs. Unfortunately, we were unable to make many assignments in this detergent, in particular, for residues close to the N terminus of the peptides where, in some samples, there appeared to be a lack of detectable signals for several resonances. For this reason, we attempted to characterize the peptides in DPC micelles. In this detergent we were able to obtain better spectral resolution with no apparent loss of signal from residues in the N-terminal region of the molecules. Spectra with the best resolution were acquired at relatively high temperatures and at low solution pHs. This has also been the case for studies of other membrane-bound proteins in detergent micelles (37Opella S.J. Ma C. Marassi F.M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 285-313Google Scholar). Even with the improved spectra obtained in DPC, there was significant overlap of peaks in the crucial amide fingerprint region, and we were not able to fully assign all of the backbone 1H resonances in either form of the peptide using standard two-dimensional homonuclear correlation spectra. To help in this process, we synthesized peptides with 15N amide labels at Val-6, Ala-11, Gly-15, Phe-19, Leu-22, and Gly-27 and used the proton assignments obtained from 15N-resolved spectra as points of departure from which to proceed with the sequential assignment of the other resonances in the peptide. In the final analysis, we were not able to unambiguously assign several resonances at the ends of the peptides. However, these residues are not believed to be found within the helical portion of the TM domain in the native protein. In general, the spectra acquired in DPC were fairly reproducible, although there was some variability in the chemical shift of amide resonances (up to 0.1 ppm), even when an effort was made to prepare samples in a consistent manner. Once dispersed in DPC, the peptides were fairly stable, with little loss of signal detected in samples that were up to a month old. With respect to the chemical shift of amide resonances, spectra obtained for the proto-oncogenic form of the peptide in DPC were noticeably different from those obtained with the mutant form. This is illustrated in 1H–15N HSQC spectra of the hexa-(15N)-labeled peptides presented in Fig. 2. Once again, for comparative purposes we have presented spectra acquired in the solvent TFE as well, where the peptides adopt very similar structures and display similar chemical shifts in this homogenous environment (20Houliston R.S. Hodges R.S. Sharom F.J. Davis J.H. FEBS Lett. 2003; 535: 39-43Google Scholar). This trend is also observed in comparing the HSQC spectra of the peptides in TFE, where there are only small differences in the position of the cross-peaks in either the proton or the nitrogen dimension (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, there is a significant variation in the position of the cross-peaks in the HSQC spectra for the two peptides dispersed in DPC micelles (Fig. 2, C and D). This difference is most pronounced for residues close to the N-terminal region of the peptide. In Fig. 3, the NH-CHα region from NOESY spectra of Neu peptides is presented, with arrows drawn to show the sequential connectivities between the NH and CHα resonances in the peptides. As noted above, there is considerable overlap of cross-peaks in these spectra, which led to difficulty in making several resonance assignments. Although there are differences in the chemical shifts of amide protons throughout the entire length of the molecules, a noticeable trend is observed in comparing the spectra of proto-oncogenic and mutant Neu peptides in DPC; the amide peak dispersion pattern is similar for residues between Phe-19 and Ile-30 but is significantly different between Val-6 and Thr-12. Because of the change in primary sequence, the position of amide resonances close to the mutation site would be expected to exhibit variability. The chemical shift of an amide proton is very sensitive to its chemical environment (39Williamson M.P. Biopolymers. 1990; 29: 1423-1431Google Scholar) and is dictated by both the structural element it is found in and its relative solvent exposure. Our spectra clearly demonstrate that the structural environment of peptides within the micelle is different, and this difference is most pronounced in the N-terminal region of the peptide.Fig. 3NOESY spectra corresponding to the NH-CHα region of Neu peptides. Spectra are of proto-oncogenic (A) and mutant (B) peptides in DPC at 50 °C. The NH-CHα cross-peaks are labeled for residues between Val-6 (V6) and Ile-30 (I30), inclusive. Arrows are drawn to show the sequential NHi–CHαi–NHi+1 connections. Single-letter amino acid abbreviations are used with position numbers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The optical CD data not only indicate that the two forms of TM Neu peptides adopt similar levels of helicity in detergent micelles, but that these levels are similar to those observed in TFE, where it was determined previously that the adopted α-helical structure incorporates residues from Val-6 through to Ile-30 (20Houliston R.S. Hodges R.S. Sharom F.J. Davis J.H. FEBS Lett. 2003; 535: 39-43Google Scholar). Even though there are significant differences in the chemical shifts of amide protons in DPC, the NMR data are consistent with the formation of a helical structure in residues 6 though 30 in both forms of the peptide. An examination of the CHα chemical shifts for these residues indicates they are uniformly upfield of random coil values, which is a strong indication of α-helix formation (39Williamson M.P. Biopolymers. 1990; 29: 1423-1431Google Scholar). The CHα chemical shift deviations from random coil values (CSDs) for residues 6 through 30 are presented as a histogram in Fig. 4A for both peptides. Once again, it can be seen in this figure that, for the residues in the C-terminal region of the peptide, the CHα CSDs are almost identical. There are observable differences in the histogram, however, for residues close to the N terminus (e.g. Thr-9, Ala-11, and Thr-12), and, where differences exist, the CHα CSDs are more negative for residues found in the proto-oncogenic peptide. This is potentially indicative of a more rigid helical structure in this region for this form of the molecule. It should be noted that, among the residues that we were able to assign at the ends of the peptides, the CHα shifts are very close to random coil values (data not shown). The NOE connectivity profile is presented for both peptides in Fig. 4B. Even in light of the considerable overlap of peaks in the NOESY spectra, which prevented the assignment of several peaks, the pattern for both peptides is typical of an α-helix, with several Hαi-NHi+3, Hαi-NHi+4, and Hβi-NHi+1 contacts for residues between 6 and 30. Curiously, we observed no NHi-NHi+1 contacts in the mutant form of the peptide in the N-terminal region, whereas several were observed in the protooncogenic peptide. As was noted earlier concerning differences in the CHα CSDs for residues in this region, this provides evidence that, although both the mutant and proto-oncogenic peptides are helical, the structure formed by the mutant pepti"
