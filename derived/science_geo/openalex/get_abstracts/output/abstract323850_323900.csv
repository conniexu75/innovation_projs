https://openalex.org/W2154150003,"Over 40 years of records from Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, show that the 18.6-year tidal component strongly regulates the frequencies of eruption of Grand and Steamboat geysers. The frequency of Grand Geyser increases with increasing tidal force and that of Steamboat Geyser decreases, which suggests that tidal dilatation is one factor affecting heat flow to a geyser."

https://openalex.org/W2006490722,"Ten-meter radar observations of the sea have been used to study second-order interactions between waves in electromagnetic scattering from the sea. Techniques of coherent, pulsed radar provide echo frequency spectra from several range intervals. The echo spectra are resolved with an analysis window of a few millihertz. These spectra show a clear second-order echo continuum which appears as sidebands about the first-order Bragg scattering lines. Up to one-half of the total echo power has been observed in these sidebands. The principal characteristics of these sidebands vary with time, apparently in response to the sea state. The form of the echo spectra is consistent with the results of perturbation theory computations based on Rice's method."

These periods correspond to two fairly coherent large-scale climatic regimes with different air-sea coupling, which were previously identified. The rise was mainly due to a change in the thermohaline structure of the water as a result of changes in prevailing winds."

https://openalex.org/W1968644897,"Spongy mesophyll tissue has been discovered preserved in fossil leaf compressions. The fossils occur in an outcrop at Genesee, Alberta, Canada. The fossiliferous beds belong to the Edmonton formation of Upper Cretaceous-lower Tertiary age. The mesophyll characteristic, when taken in conjunction with other characteristics, was found useful in the identification of some fossil leaves. Numerous detailed observations as well as comparisons of both living and fossil leaves show that the remains represent neither the epidermal nor the palisade tissue."
