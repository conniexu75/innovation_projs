https://openalex.org/W4238873921,"Suspensions of polarizable particles in nonpolarizable solvents form fibrillated structures in strong electric fields. The resulting increase in viscosity of these ""electrorheological"" fluids can couple electrical to hydraulic components in a servomechanism. The physical properties of these fluids are unusual owing to the long-range, anisotropic nature of the interparticle forces. Immediately after the electric field is applied, elongated chains or columns of particles form parallel to the field. This structure then coarsens as a result of thermal forces between the columns. In shear flows, fluids show yielding behavior at low stresses followed by shear-thinning behavior at higher stresses."
https://openalex.org/W2034555460,The fabrication and characterization of a glass containing a regular parallel array of submicrometer channels or capillaries are described. The capillaries are arranged in a two-dimensional hexagonal close packing configuration with channel diameters as small as 33 nanometers and packing densities as high as 3 x 10(10) channels per square centimeter. The high-temperature stability of the nanochannel glass array is well suited as a host or template for the formation of quantum confined semiconductor structures or as a mask for massively parallel patterned lithographic applications.

Axenic cultures of Gloeocapsa sp., adapted to nitrate-free medium, form ethylene at rates comparable to those of species known to fix nitrogen."
https://openalex.org/W1992182541,"The microscopic pathway along which ions or molecules in a crystal move during a structural phase transition can often be described in terms of a collective vibrational mode of the lattice. In many cases, this mode, called a ""soft"" phonon mode because of its characteristically low frequency near the phase transition temperature, is difficult to characterize through conventional frequency-domain spectroscopies such as light or neutron scattering. A femtosecond time-domain analog of light-scattering spectroscopy called impulsive stimulated Raman scattering (ISRS) has been used to examine the soft modes of two perovskite ferroelectric crystals. The low-frequency lattice dynamics of KNbO(3) and BaTiO(3) are clarified in a manner that permits critical evaluation of microscopic models for their ferroelectric transitions. The results illustrate the advantages of ISRS over conventional Raman spectroscopy of low-frequency, heavily damped soft modes."
https://openalex.org/W2066291720,"Although most recent hypotheses of pigeon homing have assigned an essential role to the sun, there has been some evidence suggesting that the sun is not essential. Two series of releases were designed to examine the question more carefully. Birds whose internal clocks had been shifted 6 hours were used in the critical tests. Under sun, the vanishing bearings of the clock-shifted birds were deflected in the direction predicted by a hypothesis of use of the sun as a simple compass. By contrast, under total overcast the bearings of both the clock-shifted and the control birds were homeward oriented and there was no difference between them, even at a release site the birds could never have seen previously. Therefore it is concluded that the sun is used as a compass when it is available, but that the pigeon navigation system contains sufficient redundancy to make accurate orientation possible in the absence of both the sun and familiar landmarks; the orientational cues used under such conditions do not require time compensation. This conclusion is in complete disagreement with the Matthews sun-arc hypothesis of pigeon navigation, and it makes necessary a major reformulation (at the very least) of the other principal hypothesis, that of Kramer."
https://openalex.org/W2029107412,"An improved quantum Monte Carlo method has been used to calculate the classical barrier height for the hydrogen exchange reaction H + H(2) --> H(2) + H with accuracies greater than previously attained. The method is exact in that, except for the easily estimated Monte Carlo statistical or sampling error, it requires no mathematical approximations or physical approximations beyond those of the Schrödinger equation. The minimum in the barrier, occurring for the collinear nuclear configuration with the protons separated by 1.757 bohrs, was found to be 9.61 +/- 0.01 kilocalories per mole above H + H(2)."
https://openalex.org/W1963490108,"Ultrasonic composite oscillator measurements of the mechanical relaxation in RBa(2)Cu(3)O(7-8) arising from oxygen hopping in the basal chain layer show enhancements in oxygen mobility of 20, 50, and 100 times for R = gadolinium, neodymium, and lanthanum, respectively, above that for R = yttrium. The use of the larger rare earths offers a practical solution to the major problem of slow oxygen diffusion in single crystals and bulk, dense material for wires and melt-textured monolithic bodies."
https://openalex.org/W2081700012,"The structure of model silica-supported copper catalysts has been investigated with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy (IRAS). The IRAS studies of CO on the model silica-supported copper catalysts indicate that there are several types of copper clusters with surface structures similar to (111), (110), and other high-index planes of single-crystal copper. The STM studies show several types of copper clusters on silica and reveal images of metal clusters on an amorphous oxide support with atomic resolution."
https://openalex.org/W1986341922,Two components of the sex attractant of a female dermestid beetle Trogoderma inclusum Le Conte were identified. They are (—)-14-methyl-cis-8-hexadecen-1-ol and (—)-methyl-14-methyl-cis-8-hexadecenoate. Other Trogoderma species also respond to the compounds.
https://openalex.org/W1991524250,"Individual plants of hummingbird-pollinated Besleria triflora display two flower morphs: staminate flowers, which have shortened styles and do not produce fruit, and hermaphrodite flowers. Experiments with B. triflora indicate that pollinator attraction can drive the evolution of a dimorphic plant sexual system. In field-manipulated plants, visitation increased at large floral displays; however, pollen receipt increased only when staminate flowers were used to enlarge the display. Laboratory experiments showed that staminate flowers do not remove pollen from visiting pollinators, effectively concentrating outcross pollen onto stigmas of fertile flowers. A dimorphic sexual system is favored because the morphology of staminate flowers enhances their role in pollinator attraction."

https://openalex.org/W1999072427,"Bimodal volcanism in the Santa Maria Province of west-central California occurred when segments of the East Pacific Rise interacted with a subduction zone along the California margin during the Early Miocene (about 17 million years ago). Isotopic compositions of neodymium and strontium as well as trace-element data indicate that these volcanic rocks were derived from a depleted-mantle (mid-ocean ridge basalt) source. After ridge-trench interactions, the depleted-mantle reservoir was juxtaposed beneath the continental margin and was erupted to form basalts. It also assimilated and partially melted local Jurassic-Cretaceous sedimentary and metasedimentary basement rocks to form rhyolites and dacites."

https://openalex.org/W1983516970,"A pulsed ruby laser (wavelength, 694.3 nanometers) was used to measure the dependence on light intensity of light-induced electron paramagnetic resonance (ERR) signal 1 for short flashes of uniform duration (400 microseconds). Approximately 1018 photons per square centimeter per flash from the unattenuated beam were available to the sample of subchloroplast ""system 1"" particles from spinach. The experimental dependence of the EPR signal height plotted as a function of the total number of incident photons per flash was exponential. From measurement of the slope at a very low relative photon flux and the saturated EPR signal amplitude, the value for the cross section or ""effective size"" of the light-induced paramagnetic unit, σEPR, was found to be 300 × 10-17 square centimeter. This result is compared with a measured optical absorption cross section, σ694nm, of 2.5 × 10-17 square centimeter, for the identical sample at the laser wavelength. The hundredfold difference in size supports the thesis that the paramagnetic state is a property of an aggregate of chlorophyll molecules of the same general size as the photosynthetic unit."
https://openalex.org/W2073802065,"The contribution of oceanic gabbros, representative rocks for layer 3 of the oceanic crust, to sea-floor spreading magnetic anomalies has been controversial because of the large variation in magnetic properties. Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 118 contains a continuous 500.7-meter section of oceanic gabbro that allows the relations between magnetization and petrologic characteristics, such as the degree of metamorphism and the magmatic evolution, to be clarified. The data suggest that oceanic gabbros, together with the effects of metamorphism and of magmatic evolution, account for a significant part of the marine magnetic anomalies."
https://openalex.org/W2014191792,"Basalts from many ocean islands define elongate arrays in Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic space; these likely reflect the dominance of binary mixing of mantle sources in intraplate volcanism. S. R. Hart et al. (1) observe that when these arrays are projected onto a ternary diagram bounded by mantle end-members DMM [depleted mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) mantle], HIMU (high U/Pb mantle), and EMI (enriched mantle 1), they are subparallel and point toward a composition on the DMM-HIMU join. Hart et al. suggest this composition is associated with a high ^3He/^4He ratio (>30 R_A) and therefore cannot be a ubiquitous upper-mantle mixture of DMM and HIMU (both of which have ^3He/^4He < 9 R_A). They instead argue in favor of a new isotopic component, resident in a deep mantle Focus Zone (FOZO), which is characterized by a high ^3He/^4He ratio or which acquires helium with a high ^3He/^4He signature from the core."
https://openalex.org/W2035145418,"Earthquakes instrumentally recorded from 1966 to 1968 have occurred in the same regions of western Colorado, the Arkansas and Platte river valleys, as those felt back to 1870 (from newspaper reports), despite the increasing cultural effects of mining, highway construction, reservoir building, and loading. Thus it appears unnecessary to explain the Denver earthquakes in terms of pressure induced by the introduction of waste fluid. However, the assumption of preexistent tectonic strains in the area of the Rocky Mountain Arsenal seems to be confirmed."
https://openalex.org/W2066124083,"Leaves indistinguishable from those of the late Paleozoic genus Glossopteris occur in Middle Jurassic beds in the State of Oaxaca, Mexico. If they are biologically related to the Permo-Carboniferous Glossopteris, the occurrence in Mexico is the latest report of the genus. Alternatively, these leaves may have belonged to another group of plants with foliage similar to that of Glossopteris, but with a different reproductive structure."
https://openalex.org/W1973778986,"On 24 January 1968, a transient deep-circulation event was recorded by a triangular array of autonomous current recorders installed 3 meters above the bottom at two of the three positions and at intervals of 3 to 1000 meters above the bottom at the third position in a depth of 3950 meters above the relatively smooth floor of the eastern North Pacific. The event interrupted a 24-hour record of relatively steady but peculiar conditions, lasted for about 1(1/2) hours, and was followed by current directions and speeds that greatly differed from those of the initial period. The event occurred over a volume of the sea of at least 2 kilometers in horizontal dimensions and 1 kilometer thick. Associated with the event were many small clockwise-rotating features extending from 3 to at least 1000 meters above the bottom and a rapidly increasing current velocity at 1000 meters. The event was probably local and may have involved convective motion, internal waves, and the passage of front. Some of the changes in horizontal velocity may have resulted from the combined effects of upwelling and the earth's rotation."

https://openalex.org/W2049170168,"The average hourly precipitation amounts, on 96 experimental days without cloud seeding in the Whitetop experiment, show a marked maximum between 4 and 7 o'clock in the afternoon, presumably reflecting the convection activity caused by heating of the ground occurring during an earlier period. No such maximum is observed on the 102 days with seeding. The hypothetical explanation presupposes that seeding with silver iodide creates early general cloudiness, which prevents ground temperatures from rising to levels usually attained on days without seeding. This hypothesis may explain not only the mechanism of the loss in rain in the Whitetop experiment, apparently induced by seeding, but also may explain certain phenomena noticed in the Grossversuch III experiment."
