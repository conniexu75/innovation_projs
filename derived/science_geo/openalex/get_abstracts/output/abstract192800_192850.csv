https://openalex.org/W1516654642,"It was shown recently that the poky strain of Neurospora accumulates large amounts of cytochrome c, but is deficient in cytochromes a and b and thus in cytochrome oxidase and succinic acid oxidase activities (1). These findings, which suggest that respiration in poky does not utilize the cytochrome system, led to a study of the respiratory system of poky compared with that of wild type. The experiments reported here are concerned with the effects of the inhibitors cyanide and azide on the respiration of intact mycelium of poky and wild type, the oxygen uptake of cell-free extracts in the oxidation of their endogenous substrates, the cofactor requirement for this oxidation, and the effects of azide and of oxygen tension. Evidence presented confirms that, in poky, respiration does not depend upon the cytochromes, but upon another terminal oxidase system in which flavin-adenine dinucleotide (FAD) enzymes appear to be concerned."

This reaction was anaphylactoid in type, being characterized by jactitating convulsions followed by acute circulatory collapse. Although superficially resembling true anaphylaxis, it differed from the latter in that (a) it occurred in animals which had not been exposed previously to dextran sulphate ; (b) it was not accompanied by severe respiratory embarrassment. No coughing, wheezing or sneezing occurred, and animals killed during attacks showed no evidence of bronchiolar constriction or pulmonary emphysema ; (c) the reaction could not be prevented or inhibited by large doses of the antihistamine compounds which inhibit anaphylaxis2. Equivalent doses of the compounds producing this effect in the guinea pig did not produce similar reactions in the mouse, rat, rabbit, dog or baboon."

Since this acid, believed to be homogeneous, was found (3) to induce the cellular response originally reported by Sabin (4) for certain acidic components of the tubercle bacillus, its structure was investigated. In a second paper (5), there was proposed for C&-phthienoic acid the partial structural formula, I, which specified all structural features"
