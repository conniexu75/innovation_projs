https://openalex.org/W1581414347,"The purification of homogeneous glutathione S-transferases B and C from rat liver is described. Kinetic and physical properties of these enzymes are compared with those of homogeneous transferases A and E. The letter designations for the transferases are based on the reverse order of elution from carboxymethylcellulose, the purification step in which the transferases are separated from each other. Transferase B was purified on the basis of its ability to conjugate iodomethane with glutathione, whereas transferase C was purified on the basis of conjugation with 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene. Although each of the four enzymes can be identified by its reactivity with specific substrates, all of the enzymes are active to differing degrees in the conjugation of glutathione with p-nitrobenzyl chloride. Assay conditions for a variety of substrates are included. All four glutathione transferases have a molecular weight of 45,000 and are dissociable into subunits of approximately 25,000 daltons. Despite the similar physical properties and overlapping substrate specificities of these enzymes, only transferases A and C are immunologically related."

In utero the decrease in dihydrotestosterone results in incomplete masculinization of the external genitalia. Inheritance is autosomal recessive."
https://openalex.org/W1574122095,"Of 47 steroid compounds tested for their ability to suppress 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity in cultured human fibroblasts, 11 were more potent than cholesterol. The only consistent structural requirement for suppression of enzyme activity was the presence of an unesterified oxygen function at position 3 of the sterol nucleus. The presence of a ketone or hydroxyl group at positions 6, 7, or 25 markedly enhanced inhibitory activity. In fibroblasts from a homozygote with familial hypercholesterolemia, which are genetically resistant to physiological enzyme suppression by cholesterol contained in low density lipoproteins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity was suppressed by nonlipoprotein steroids to the same degree as in normal cells. 7-Ketocholesterol, which was 100 times more potent than cholesterol on a weight basis, suppressed enzyme activity in normal cells by more than 90% in 2 hours. This inhibition was reflected in a similarly marked decrease in the rate of incorporation of acetate, but not mevalonate into digitonin-precipitable sterols. When normal cells were cultured in the presence of 7-ketocholesterol but in the absence of lipoproteins, the suppression of endogenous cholesterol synthesis by 7-ketocholesterol resulted in a marked inhibition of cell growth. This inhibition of growth was prevented by the presence in the culture medium of either cholesterol or mevalonate, but not acetate. Thus, the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase became the rate-limiting factor both for cholesterogenesis and for growth of fibroblasts under conditions where exogenous cholesterol was not available to the cells. It is concluded that 7-ketocholesterol may provide a powerful tool for delineation of the mechanism by which cholesterol and other steroids promote the growth of human cells in culture."

https://openalex.org/W1550250208,"Glutathione transferase A has been purified from rat liver. The enzyme catalyzes the conjugation of glutathione with compounds bearing an electrophilic site, especially those in which the electrophilic site is on, or α to, an aromatic ring. The enzyme has a molecular weight of 45,000 and is composed of two similar subunits. Initial velocity, product inhibition, and binding studies indicate a biphasic kinetic mechanism in which the reaction pathway depends on the concentration of the substrates. At high concentrations of GSH, an ordered sequential pathway predominates in which GSH binds first. At low concentrations of GSH, a ping-pong pathway predominates in which the electrophilic substrate adds first. In accordance with a prediction of the general rate equation for the over-all mechanism, the breakpoint in the biphasic double reciprocal plot for GSH saturation was found to shift to lower GSH concentrations as the concentration of the electrophilic substrate was lowered. A numerical rate equation was developed which describes initial velocities over the entire range of substrate concentrations. An appendix presents a method for distinguishing among several formal kinetic mechanisms which yield nonlinear double reciprocal initial velocity plots as a result of multiple reaction pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1528669392,"Abstract The carbohydrate composition of an IgA (α1 subtype) myeloma protein has been determined. The carbohydrate, present only on the heavy chain, was found to consist of 3 moles of sialic acid, 9 mole of galactose, 5.4 moles of mannose, 0.8 moles of fucose, 8.8 moles of N-acetylglucosamine, and 5 moles of N-acetylgalactosamine per mole of heavy chain. Four major glycopeptide-containing fractions were isolated following pronase degradation of the protein. Glycopeptide I consisted of galactose, N-acetylgalactosamine, threonine, serine, and proline in the molar ratio 4:5:4:5:9. Each of the N-acetylgalactosamine residues was found to be involved in an O-glycosidic linkage, demonstrating that there are five O-glycosidically linked oligosaccharide units per heavy chain. The structure of this glycopeptide is presented in the following paper (Baenziger, J., and Kornfeld, S. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 7270–7281. The three other glycopeptide fractions contained 1 to 2 residues of sialic acid, 0 to 0.7 residue of fucose, 2 residues of galactose, 3 residues of mannose, 4 to 5 residues of N-acetylglucosamine, and 1 residue of asparagine. Glycopeptide IIA was a homogeneous glycopeptide with the following structure: Glycopeptide fractions IIB and IIC did not appear to be homogeneous, but instead each contained 2 glycopeptides. In both cases, one of the glycopeptides was probably the disialyl form of IIA containing a residue of sialic acid linked α2,6 to the terminal galactose. The other glycopeptide had 2 rather than 3 nonreducing termini arising from the core mannose. Both of these terminated in sialic acid and had the same sequence as that found for the sialic acid-containing terminus of IIA. These termini arose from positions 3 and 6 of the core mannose. The core of this glycopeptide differed from that of IIA in having a residue of fucose which was most likely linked α1,6 to the N-acetylglucosamine involved in the N-glycosidic linkage to the peptide."
https://openalex.org/W2005457664,"Abstract Seventeen clones resistant to the cytotoxic action of ouabain were isolated in culture by direct selection from 5 independent strains of diploid human fibroblasts. Resistant clones were recovered at frequencies on the order of 10 −7 per wild type cell selected from populations treated with the mutagen EMS, but no resistant cells were detected among 10 8 unmutagenized cells. Most selected clones remained ouabain-resistant following further propagation in the absence of drug. The growth of wild type cells was inhibited by 50% at ouabain concentrations of 2–5 × 10 −8 M, while resistant clones required 15–180 fold higher drug concentrations to cause equivalent inhibition. Ouabain-resistant clones showed increased resistance of K+ transport function to ouabain inhibition that paralleled their increased resistance to growth inhibition. Initial experiments suggest that under selective conditions the resistant diploid fibroblasts differ significantly from wild type in binding of 3 H-ouabain per unit surface area. The ouabain-resistant cells were similar to wild type in transport properties unrelated to ouabain inhibition. Resistant cells had normal karyotypes and senesced with a lifespan similar to control clones. The ouabain-resistant phenotypes of these diploid human fibroblast isolates apparently reflect point mutations that specifically affect the Na+/K+ transport ATPase with respect to ouabain-binding and/or response to bound ouabain."

https://openalex.org/W1603517852,"Abstract A model compound was prepared having the same optical properties in the Soret and visible regions as the CO-adduct of ferrous cytochrome P-450. Obligate for the formation of this spectral species absorbing at 450 nm (emm = 93) and 555 nm (emm = 23) in a dimethylsulfoxide-ethanol solvent system was the presence of ferrous heme, CO, thiol, and a strong base. Decreasing the dielectric constant of the solvent, which would be equivalent to increasing the hydrophobicity of the heme environment in the protein, causes a small shift in the Soret absorption to the blue with no change in emm. The absence of thiol or strong base resulted in the formation of typical heme·CO absorptions at 413 nm (emm = 150), 535 nm (emm = 25), and 566 nm (emm = 30). It is concluded that the sulfur-containing axial ligand in the model compound and also in ferrous cytochromes P-450·CO is a mercaptide anion."
https://openalex.org/W1523787450,"The subunit assembly of bovine erythrocyte superoxide dismutase has been studied, through analysis of the effects of heat, removal of metal ion cofactors, and disulfide bond reduction, upon the dissociation of the subunits. Investigations utilizing sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gel electrophoresis and sedimentation equilibrium analysis demonstrate that the 2 polypeptide subunits of the protein are not covalently joined, but are associated through unusually strong noncovalent interactions. This absence of intersubunit disulfide bonds, in conjunction with the titration of a single free sulfhydryl group per subunit polypeptide chain, necessitates that the 3 half-cystine residues per subunit exist as 1 residue of cystine, forming an intrasubunit disulfide bond, and 1 residue of cysteine. The specific half-cystine residues participating in the disulfide linkage and contributing the free thiol function were identified. Analysis of the products of cyanogen bromide cleavage, with acrylamide gel electrophoresis, demonstrates that the intrasubunit disulfide links 1 half-cystine residue in the sequence NH2-terminal to Met-115, to another half-cystine residue in the sequence COOH-terminal to Met-115. Through conventional procedures of enzymatic digestion, peptide isolation, and peptide characterization, Cys-55 and Cys-144 are shown to participate in the intrasubunit disulfide linkage, and Cys-6 to exist as free cysteine."
https://openalex.org/W1493996129,"Abstract Several lines of evidence are presented for the involvement of spermidine in milk protein synthesis during hormone-dependent differentiation of mouse mammary epithelium in vitro. (a) When mammary explants from midpregnant mice are cultured in the presence of insulin, hydrocortisone, and prolactin, synthesis of casein and α-lactalbumin increases markedly during the initial 48 hours. The requirement for hydrocortisone, but not for insulin or prolactin, can be met by spermidine at a concentration as low as 10-4 m. Thus the combination of insulin, spermidine, and prolactin results in an increase in synthesis of the milk proteins similar to that produced by the triple hormone combination. The related polyamines, spermine and putrescine, and divalent cations such as Mg2+ are ineffective. (b) The concentration of spermidine in mammary epithelium increases by about 3-fold when mammary explants are incubated for 48 hours in the presence of insulin, hydrocortisone, and prolactin, the same combination of hormones which causes marked stimulation of milk protein synthesis. Significant increases in the spermidine concentration occur prior to the accelerated synthesis of milk proteins. The combination of insulin and prolactin, which results in a slight stimulation of milk protein synthesis, correspondingly effects a smaller increase in the intracellular concentration of spermidine. (c) Methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone), a potent inhibitor of spermidine synthesis, at a concentration of 2 µm, prevents increases in both the cellular spermidine concentration and the milk protein synthesis that occur in the presence of the three hormones. The simultaneous presence of spermidine, but not spermine or putrescine, however, overcomes the inhibitory effect of methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) on milk protein synthesis. The mechanism whereby glucocorticoid, together with insulin and prolactin, causes the large increase in the concentration of spermidine in cultured mammary cells appears to be mediated through stimulation of the activity of S-adenosyl-l-methionine decarboxylase, which plays a key role in the biosynthesis of spermidine. In mammary epithelium, glucocorticoid, in combination with insulin, markedly increases the enzyme activity in concert with the increase in spermidine concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1545816668,"Abstract Duck erythroid cells were fractionated by centrifugation in bovine serum albumin density gradients. Differences in cell density were correlated with the stage of maturation as determined by biochemical and morphological parameters. Avian erythroid cells increase in density as they mature. Cell populations corresponding to known stages in differentiation were compared with regard to histone composition and degree of acetylation, nature and amount of the non-histone nuclear proteins, and DNA and RNA synthetic capacities. Although the total histone to DNA ratio of the chromatin does not vary appreciably during maturation, the relative proportion of the erythroid cell-specific histone F2c increases at least 2-fold with the increasing age of the cell, whereas the other histones, except F2a2, decrease. The degree of acetylation of histones F2a1 and F3 decreases with the increasing age of the cell. The non-histone protein complement of the erythroid cell nucleus decreases 6-fold during maturation. Analysis of the non-histone proteins in polyacrylamide gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate shows a limited heterogeneity and a remarkable similarity in their electrophoretic patterns at different stages in maturation. Quantitative rather than qualitative changes predominate as maturation proceeds. The decline in non-histone protein content with age is striking particularly in the lower molecular weight components. However, a protein band of molecular weight 55,000 is conserved selectively during maturation and it represents the predominant component of the non-histone nuclear proteins of the mature erythrocyte. The nucleoprotein changes occurring during erythrocyte maturation parallel a decrease in the amount of chromatin-associated RNA and the rate of RNA synthesis. The average RNA synthetic capacity of the isolated erythroblasts and early polychromatic erythrocytes is about 8 times higher than that of the mature erythrocyte fraction."
https://openalex.org/W2109389789,"Abstract 5'-Guanylyl-imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p), an analog of GTP, augments isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase causing greater activation of the enzyme than with 7 mm sodium fluoride. The effect occurs with a Km for Gpp(NH)p of 10-7 m. A similar Km was observed for the slight stimulation of the enzyme by the nucleotide in the absence of added hormone. The greatly enhanced stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity by isoproterenol in the presence of Gpp(NH)p is blocked completely by propranolol. The latter does not, however, abolish the stimulation of basal activity produced by the nucleotide. The Km for isoproterenol activation of adenylate cyclase is decreased one order of magnitude by Gpp(NH)p. Gpp(NH)p binds to the cell membranes with a Km equivalent to that found for effects on adenylate cyclase activity. Propranolol does not inhibit binding of the nucleotide, but unlabeled Gpp(NH)p and other nucleotides competitively displace labeled Gpp(NH)p from its binding sites with apparent affinities comparable to the order of potencies for augmenting catecholamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase. Displacement of Gpp(NH)p from the binding site by GTP or ITP (GTP was 100 times as effective as ITP) decreases enzyme activity activated by isoproterenol in the presence of Gpp(NH)p. Thus, a high affinity purine nucleotide site is involved in regulating the catalytic function of the adenylate cyclase complex. The apparent affinity of the site for ATP is much lower than for GTP or Gpp(NH)p. This finding indicates that, although ATP is clearly the substrate for the enzyme, it is GTP and not ATP that interacts at the regulatory site (identified as a Gpp(NH)p binding site)."

https://openalex.org/W2088957494,"Two pathways for addition of poly(A) to hnRNA can be identified by using very brief periods of exposure to radioactive nucleosides to label hnRNA. Poly(A)-containing molecules of various size classes have been analyzed from cells exposed for 2.5 min or less to 3H-adenosine [which labels both the transcribed region of hnRNA and the poly(A) added after transcription] or to 3H-uridine (which labels only the transcribed region). After labeling for 30 sec or 2.5 min with 3H-U, more than 80% of the radioactivity that enters poly(A)-containing hnRNA is located in molecules sedimenting faster than 32S. Since incorporation of 3H-U identifies newly synthesized molecules, poly(A) must be added to some large “new” transcripts within 30 sec of exposure to 3H-U. Although only 10–15% of the poly(A)-containing molecules labeled with 3H-U sediment at less than 32S, about 35% of the molecules labeled with 3H-A for 30 sec are smaller than 32S. Most (up to 80%) of the label incorporated into small poly(A)-containing hnRNA molecules during a 1 min exposure to 3H-A is located in the poly(A) region. Since few of the small molecules are labeled with 3H-U, they must represent “old” transcripts not yet modified or fragments of originally larger transcripts to which poly(A) is added. Treatment with DMSO of hnRNA molecules sedimenting at less than 32S does not alter their properties. But DMSO treatment of hnRNA sedimenting faster than 45S appears to release small poly(A)-containing molecules. This suggests that some of the large hnRNA molecules may be partially processed, presumably maintained by secondary structure, so that on denaturation they release smaller molecules. There seems therefore to be no single program for hnRNA synthesis and processing; some (mostly large) molecules have poly(A) added immediately after synthesis, whereas other (mostly small) molecules undergo addition at a later time. It is likely also that some molecules are processed prior to addition of poly(A), whereas others are processed after addition of poly(A)."
https://openalex.org/W1608275961,"Abstract The arrangement of proteins in the normal human erythrocyte membrane was studied using lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination. The outer membrane surface of both intact erythrocytes and resealed ghosts was labeled with externally added lactoperoxidase. The cytoplasmic membrane surface was probed by sealing lactoperoxidase inside the resealed ghosts. Following iodination, the membrane components were separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate acrylamide gels, and the distribution of radioactive iodide into the various molecular weight classes was determined. The same components appear to be labeled on the external surface of resealed ghosts as are labeled in intact erythrocytes: a 90,000 molecular weight component (Protein 3), the major glycoprotein (periodate fuchsin sulfite (PAS)I), and two minor glycoproteins with apparent molecular weights of 40,000 (PAS II) and 27,000 (PAS III). However, PAS II is more extensively labeled in resealed ghosts than in intact erythrocytes, suggesting that alteration of the membrane has occurred during the course of the preparation of membranes and their resealing. Iodination of the internal surface of resealed ghosts reveals that all of the components labeled on the exterior surface also appear to be labeled at the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane. In addition, spectrin also is labeled at the inner surface of resealed ghosts. Separation of the partially purified glycoproteins by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis indicates that the region of PAS II is actually composed of at least two components, designated PAS II' and PAS II. The slower moving component, PAS II', appears to be labeled at both surfaces of the membrane, whereas the faster moving component, PAS II, which also stains more intensely with periodate fuchsin sulfite, is labeled only at the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane. Treatment of intact erythrocytes with pronase hydrolyzes PAS II, indicating that this component also spans the membrane. The differences in labeling between the major glycoprotein, PAS I, and PAS II indicate that these components are not identical, as has been suggested by others. Thus all five components detectable on the external surface of the normal human erythrocyte span the membrane and can be labeled on the interior surface."
https://openalex.org/W1566747358,"Abstract The protein mixture discharged by guinea pig pancreatic lobules incubated in vitro has been analyzed by two complementary techniques: isoelectric focusing (which separates proteins according to charge), and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (which separates proteins according to size). Isoelectric focusing columns spanning a set of pH ranges were used to fractionate secretory proteins biosynthetically labeled with 3H- or 14C-amino acids. Effluent fractions were used to determine radioactivity distribution and to locate (by specific enzyme assays) ribonuclease, amylase, chymotrypsinogen, trypsinogen, procarboxypeptidase A and procarboxypeptidase B either directly or after trypsin activation. There are single species of the first four proteins all of which are isoelectric above pH 9.2, and two forms of each procarboxypeptidase isoelectric near pH 5 (procarboxypeptidase A) and pH 7 (procarboxypeptidase B). The average isoelectric point of secretion mass-labeled with a mixture of 15 14C-amino acids is at pH 9.2. The most acidic species isoelectric near pH 3.4 can be labeled with both 35SO42- and amino acids. Its charge complementarity with the bulk of the secretory proteins is discussed with reference to the concentration and packaging of secretory proteins in the condensing vacuoles of the acinar cells. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels resolve eight major proteins from the secretion. Six of these have been identified by cross-referencing aliquots from the isoelectric focusing columns onto the gels. No enzyme activities or potential activities have been assigned to two of the major proteins: the first has a molecular weight of 68,000 and the second appears to be slightly smaller than chymotrypsinogen. The results indicate that the guinea pig pancreas produces essentially the same complement of enzymes and zymogens as found in other species; they also demonstrate that the zymogen granules of the acinar cells contain the same proteins as the secretion discharged by pancreatic lobules upon carbamylcholine stimulation. The procedures described can be used to analyze on a protein-specific basis a variety of events in the secretory process."
https://openalex.org/W1510340182,"Abstract [3H]Prostaglandin (PG) E1 bound to the cell membrane fraction of bovine corpus luteum with high affinity and specificity. Unlabeled PGE1 and E2 inhibited [3H]PGE1 binding to the membranes in a dose-dependent manner with complete inhibition occurring at 1.4 x 10-7 m. Other PGs (PGF1α, F2α, B1, A1, and A2) inhibited 80 to 100% of [3H]PGE1 binding only at 100-fold greater concentrations than that of PGEs. Membrane-bound and free [3H]PGE1 were found to be essentially unchanged under the present incubation conditions. The Scatchard plot analysis of the equilibrium binding data suggested the presence of high and low affinity binding sites having apparent dissociation constants (Kd) of 1.3 x 10-9 m and 1.0 x 10-8 m, respectively. Free energy changes of +12.6 and +11.4 Cal per mole were calculated for the dissociation of [3H]PGE1 from high and low affinity binding sites, respectively. The rate constants for association and dissociation, 1.9 x 105 m-1 s-1 and 2.8 x 10-3 s-1, were measured at 38°. The apparent Kd calculated from the ratio of rate constants at 22° and 38° (2.8 x 10-8 m versus 1.5 x 10-8 m) agreed very well with each other. Maximum specific binding of [3H]PGE1 occurred at pH 6.2 from 30 to 38°. For concentrations of various cations, up to 1 x 10-1 m, only Ca2+ and Mg2+ moderately increased [3H]PGE1 binding. When the concentrations were increased above 1 x 10-1 m, both mono- and divalent cations significantly decreased [3H]PGE1 binding. Incubation of membranes with various enzymes revealed that PGE receptor molecules are protein in nature which require lipids and specific phospholipids, but not sialic acid residues, of membranes and/or receptor in binding of [3H]-PGE1. Treatment of membranes with several protein-modifying reagents suggested that tyrosyl residues but not sulfhydryl groups were involved in the binding interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1576306137,"Abstract S-Formylglutathione hydrolase, a new glutathione thiol esterase from human liver, has been purified into homogeneity according to disc electrophoretic and ultracentrifugal criteria. The final preparation catalyzes the hydrolysis of 4100 µmoles of S-formylglutathione per min per mg of protein at 25° and represents 2,350-fold purification over 23,000 x g supernatant of liver homogenate. In addition to S-formylglutathione, the enzyme can catalyze the hydrolysis of S-acetylglutathione at a 200-fold slower velocity but has no activity with S-lactylglutathione. The elution volume of the enzyme in a gel filtration column gives an apparent molecular weight of 52,500 and a diffusion coefficient of 6.57 x 10-7 cm2 s-1. The enzyme has a sedimentation coefficient of 4.24 S as judged from sedimentation velocity in analytical ultracentrifuge. From a sedimentation equilibrium experiment, the molecular weight of the enzyme is 55,500. Dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis indicates a subunit molecular weight of 30,000. Thus, the enzyme probably consists of 2 subunits. The isoelectric point of the enzyme obtained from electrofocusing experiments is 5.41. The enzyme apparently contains a reactive —SH group and purification is possible only in the presence of thiols. Activity is rapidly lost when the thiols are removed, but dithiothreitol can regenerate part of the activity. Several types of —SH reagents are inhibitory. Dithiothreitol can reverse completely the effect of mercaptide-forming and oxidizing agents. Amino group reagents also rapidly inactivate the enzyme. In addition, ascorbate and folate are inhibitory. Chelating agents and organophosphates do not inhibit the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1559638007,"Abstract Human adenylosuccinate synthetase (IMP:aspartate ligase (GDP) EC 6.3.4.4) has been purified 110-fold from placenta. The partially purified preparation was stable and free of nucleotidase activity, permitting study of substrate kinetics and regulatory properties. The Michaelis constants for the substrates, IMP, GTP, and aspartate were 37 µm, 31 µm, and 0.95 mm, respectively. Based on studies of initial velocity and product or end product inhibition, the enzyme kinetic mechanism was compatible with a sequential rapid equilibrium fully random mechanism. Human adenylosuccinate synthetase was inhibited by a variety of purine nucleotides; the corresponding nucleosides and bases were ineffective. Inhibitory effectiveness decreased with the series mono g di g triphosphates. The mechanism of inhibition by specific purine nucleotides revealed that adenylosuccinate, AMP, and XMP were competitive inhibitors with respect to IMP with Ki values of 57 µm, 170 µm, and 140 µm, respectively. GMP and GDP were competitive with respect to GTP with Ki values of 10 µm and 45 µm, respectively. These findings suggest that human adenylosuccinate synthetase activity, despite its importance in a branched pathway, is not regulated by a highly specific molecular control mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1496546820,"Abstract Functional studies have been performed on hemoglobin Kempsey (α2β299 asp→asn), a variant associated with familial erythrocytosis. In most experiments, the properties of hemoglobin Kempsey were compared to those of hemoglobin A, isolated from the same chromatography column. Hemoglobin Kempsey had high oxygen affinity (p50 at pH 7.2 was 10% that of hemoglobin A) and nearly absent subunit cooperativity. Its alkaline Bohr effect was less than one-half normal. The addition of organic phosphates (2, 3-diphosphoglycerate and inositol hexaphosphate) resulted in a lowering of oxygen affinity and an increase in subunit cooperativity. The dissociation of oxygen from partially saturated intermediates of hemoglobin Kempsey was slow and monophasic with no wavelength dependency indicative of subunit heterogeneity. The combination of carbon monoxide with deoxyhemoglobin Kempsey in a solution of low ionic strength was explained best by the presence of three hemoglobin species in equilibrium: one slowly reacting form which was probably hemoglobin in the T state and comprised 10% of the total; and two rapidly reacting forms, hemoglobin dimer and tetrameric hemoglobin in the R state. The dimer-tetramer equilibrium is shifted to favor the tetramer by inositol hexaphosphate which also converts the rapidly reacting deoxytetramer to a slowly reacting form. The existence of a substantial proportion of deoxyhemoglobin Kempsey in the form of a dimer was supported by the following experiments. (a) The change in absorbance (430 nm) following the addition of inositol hexaphosphate to deoxyhemoglobin Kempsey was dependent upon hemoglobin concentration, and indicated a tetramer to dimer dissociation constant (K4, 2) of about 5 µm. (b) Haptoglobin bound to deoxyhemoglobin Kempsey about as rapidly as to oxyhemoglobin A. The former reaction was inhibited strongly by inositol hexaphosphate. (c) The rapid component in the reaction of deoxyhemoglobin Kempsey with carbon monoxide and inositol hexaphosphate (in the same syringe) was increased at low hemoglobin concentration. (d) The hybrid hemoglobin α2βaβKempsey was relatively less stable than α2βaβs. Deoxyhemoglobin Kempsey resembled oxyhemoglobin A in reacting rapidly with p-mercuribenzoate. However after the addition of inositol hexaphosphate, this reaction was slowed 30-fold, indicating a partial transition to the T state. These results support the general conclusion that p-mercuribenzoate reactivity is a probe of over-all quaternary conformation. The interaction of hemoglobin Kempsey with ligands is consistent with a two-state allosteric model. Its functional abnormalities can be explained by a shift in the conformational equilibrium toward the R state. In contrast to hemoglobin A, the transition between conformers occurs at an earlier stage in ligand binding and is relatively slow in solutions of low ionic strength."

https://openalex.org/W2076253984,"Hb first appears in first generation erythroblasts of the chicken embryo at about 32 hr of incubation. These cells are the daughters of hematocytoblasts which themselves do not synthesize Hb. Employing a 3H-DNA complementary to purified adult chicken globin mRNA, we have assayed the transcription of the globin genes in cells in different compartments of the erythrogenic lineage. In addition, we have attempted to determine whether the globin genes are transcribed in cells not committed to Hb synthesis. Our results indicate that if the hematocytoblast contains any globin RNA, it would contain such molecules at a concentration less than 10−5 times that of the erythroblast. Embryonic fibroblast and muscle cells lack globin RNA molecules to the same extent as the hematocytoblast. Comparison of nuclear RNA globin sequence content reveals that fibroblasts and muscle cells do not contain primary transcripts of the globin genes, and that primitive erythroblasts do not transcribe all the adult globin sequences in detectable quantities."

https://openalex.org/W1976179392,"Abstract The results presented in this report show that during early development of Xenopus laevis the synthesis of 5S RNA occurs in blastula embryos, whereas the synthesis of 18S and 28S RNA cannot be detected until gastrulation. Thus the initiation of synthesis of the three ribosomal RNAs is not coordinate during early development. Blastula embryos are similar to anucleolate mutants of Xenopus laevis, in that they both synthesize 5S RNA, but are unable to assemble new ribosomes because they do not synthesize 18S and 28S RNA or ribosomal proteins. The blastula and anucleolate embryos thus provide a unique opportunity to determine if newly synthesized soluble 5S RNA can exchange with the 5S RNA present in existing ribosomes. The results show that newly synthesized 5S RNA is not incorporated into the ribosomes of blastula or anucleolate embryos. Furthermore, the 5S RNA synthesized by anucleolate mutants has a shorter half-life than the 5S RNA made by normal embryos. The synthesis of excess 5S RNA and its subsequent degradation in the absence of ribosome production appears to be another example of the phenomenon of wastage of newly synthesized ribosomal RNA."

https://openalex.org/W1500907897,"Abstract The low molecular weight DNA polymerases isolated from the chromatin and from the cytoplasmic fraction of human, rabbit, bovine, and rat tissues were tested for their ability to use r(pA)n·d(pT)11 as template. The enzyme from all of these tissues can utilize r(pA)n·d(pT)11 as template with almost the same efficiency as d(pA)n·d(pT)11. The polyriboadenylate activity co-purified with the low molecular weight DNA polymerase throughout purification, and showed some relative increase with purification. Replication of r(pA)n· d(pT)11 by the low molecular weight DNA polymerase was extensive, and the product of the replication was a double-stranded hybrid polymer. Analysis of the product of r(pA)n·d(pT)11 replication in the presence of noncomplementary deoxynucleoside triphosphate indicated that the replication is highly accurate, with a misincorporation of deoxycytidylate in polyriboadenylate replication occurring less than 1 in 3 x 105 thymidylates. In the presence of oligothymidylate, the low molecular weight DNA polymerase cannot replicate the heteropolymeric regions of natural RNAs such as chick hemoglobin mRNA or yeast tRNA with polyriboadenylates added at the 3' terminus."

https://openalex.org/W1487248435,"Abstract Rabbit liver UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase has been crystallized and further purified to a specific activity of 200 by using preparative centrifugation with sucrose density gradients. The pyrophosphorylase requires a divalent cation. Magnesium is preferred, although manganese, cobalt, and calcium can serve as less effective alternate cation activators. Maximum activity requires a reducing agent, and the enzyme has a broad pH range from 7.0 to 10.5. The molecular weight of the enzyme is approximately 400,000, with eight identical subunits. While the enzyme shows no tendency to form multimolecular aggregates as do other liver pyrophosphorylases, the eight subunits are arranged in a stacked tetrameric configuration. Amino acid analysis, peptide mapping, gel electrophoresis, and sedimentation showed the enzyme to be homogeneous with a single NH2-terminal amino acid being serine. The subunits of the rabbit liver enzyme are chemically identical as confirmed by the foregoing analyses. Although UDP-glucose is the most active substrate, the enzyme will catalyze the pyrophosphorylation of a variety of nucleoside diphosphate hexoses. Rates as high as 14% of that for UDP-glucose were obtained using UDP-galactose as a substrate. The ratio of glucose to galactose activity remained constant throughout purification and no evidence was found for a separate enzyme for UDP-galactose. The equilibrium constant in the direction of UDP-glucose formation was 0.16. The apparent Michaelis constants for UDP-glucose, UTP, and glucose 1-phosphate were 6.6 x 10-5, 3.8 x 10-5, and 4.6 x 10-5, respectively, and that for UDP-galactose was 4.2 x 10-4. UDP-galactose and galactose 1-phosphate are competitive inhibitors of UDP-glucose and glucose l-phosphate with apparent constants of 2.2 x 10-4 and 7.3 x 10-3, respectively. Either 8 moles of UDPglucose or UDP-galactose were bound per mole of enzyme, and the bound UDP-galactose could be replaced stoichiometrically by equivalent quantities of UDP-glucose. The measured chemical and physical properties of the enzyme from calf, rabbit, and human livers are compared."
https://openalex.org/W1529807207,"Abstract Glycopeptides derived from bovine nasal septum keratan sulfate by acid hydrolysis and gel chromatography are shown to be enriched in the carbohydrate-protein linkage region. The effects of alkali on these glycopeptides are compared to the effects on the starting material. It is shown that the β elimination caused by alkali is consistent with an O-glycosidic linkage between threonine or serine in the peptide and N-acetylgalactosamine in the carbohydrate chain. The glycopeptides were subjected to β elimination and reduction. The galactosamine destroyed by this treatment was converted to its reduced analog and the expected reduction products derived from serine and threonine were also formed. The carbohydrate fragments liberated were partially fractionated, and the disaccharide galactosyl-(1 →3)-N-acetylgalactosaminitol from the linkage region was isolated and characterized."

https://openalex.org/W1522622091,"Abstract Anti-hemoglobin chain antibodies, purified by immunoadsorption to Sepharose-linked antigen and thereby made both RNase-free and immunologically specific for either β or α chain, are readily bound by nascent hemoglobin chains attached to rabbit reticulocyte polysomes. Antibodies to other antigens, e.g. anti-immunoglobulin G, are not bound. Use of chain-specific antibodies enabled us to determine quantitatively the mean number of ribosomes associated with rabbit hemoglobin β- and α-messenger RNA. Such mean sizes of β- and α-polysomes could be calculated, for example, from density gradient profiles of polysomes previously coated with either 125I-labeled anti-β chain or 125I-labeled anti-α chain. Complementary estimates were obtained, pre- and postimmunoprecipitation, from (a) the A260 density gradient profiles of polysomes and (b) the profiles of β and α polysomes differentially labeled with [3H]isoleucine and [14C]valine. All estimates were similar; viz. the β:α ratio for mean number of ribosomes per mRNA ranged from 1.5 to 1.86. Among unaltered polysomes from the same rabbits, the β:α ratio for total relative numbers of synthetically active β and α ribosomes was calculated from y intercepts of Dintzis-Naughton plots to be ∼1.04 to 1.17. With these two kinds of β:α ratios as a basis, the relative numbers of active α-mRNA and β-mRNA were found to be somewhat greater than previously described by Lodish and Jacobsen ((1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 3622). For individual animals, the α-mRNA:β-mRNA ratio ranged from 1.28 to 1.78. The addition of the further 25% of α-mRNA which is unattached to polysomes (Jacobs-Lorena, M., and Baglioni, C. (1972) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 69, 1425) suggests that total α-mRNA is 2-fold more abundant than β-mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1989708029,"Abstract Boundary layer theory is applied to experimental results on the growth of monolayer cells in stirred culture. The minimal assumptions are that the cells consume a growth-promoting substance from the medium, and that diffusion to the monolayer is like that from a turbulent stream to a flat sheet. From numerical values of stirring rate and diffusion coefficient it is calculated that the growth factor: 1.(a) Is present in very low concentration; 2.(b) Is in serum; 3.(c) has a narrow range of consumption between threshold and saturation; 4.(d) Is limiting over a diffusion gradient of cellular dimensions. It is concluded that wound effects in the monolayer are explicable in terms of edgewise diffusion at limiting concentration. The mathematical similarity is pointed out between stirring and concentration: hence edge-effects due to purified growth factor in static culture are theoretically equivalent to those due to stirring. The implications of quantitative treatment of the diffusion of growth factors in vitro and in vivo are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2140204150,"Abstract A qualitative assay for detection of histone mRNA sequences in nuclear RNA was developed using actinomycin D-CsCl gradients to separate histone DNA from bulk DNA by differences in buoyant density. A significant amount of RNA synthesized in vitro in isolated nuclei from early blastula stage sea urchin embryos hybridized coincident with the histone DNA satellite, and this hybridization was competed out by unlabeled 9S polysomal RNA purified from embryos at the same stage of development. The biogenesis of these histone mRNA sequences appeared similar as observed during in vivo and in vitro synthesis. Nuclear RNA from embryos pulse labeled in vivo was found to lack histone sequences, suggesting a rapid exit time for these sequences from the nucleus. Attempts to study the exit of histone sequences from isolated nuclei labeled in vitro also suggested a rapid exit time for histone sequences. The histone sequences were synthesized to a much lesser extent in isolated nuclei from late blastula stage embryos, as anticipated from the much reduced amount of histone mRNA labeled on polysomes at this stage."
