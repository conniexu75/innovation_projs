https://openalex.org/W2039276157,"Mutations in the gene encoding the transcriptional repressor methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) cause the neurodevelopmental disorder Rett syndrome. Loss of function as well as increased dosage of the MECP2 gene cause a host of neuropsychiatric disorders. To explore the molecular mechanism(s) underlying these disorders, we examined gene expression patterns in the hypothalamus of mice that either lack or overexpress MeCP2. In both models, MeCP2 dysfunction induced changes in the expression levels of thousands of genes, but unexpectedly the majority of genes (∼85%) appeared to be activated by MeCP2. We selected six genes and confirmed that MeCP2 binds to their promoters. Furthermore, we showed that MeCP2 associates with the transcriptional activator CREB1 at the promoter of an activated target but not a repressed target. These studies suggest that MeCP2 regulates the expression of a wide range of genes in the hypothalamus and that it can function as both an activator and a repressor of transcription."

https://openalex.org/W2154697573,"Fujisawa and colleagues report that during a working memory task, firing patterns in ensembles of rat medial prefrontal cortex neurons reflect behavioral outcomes on coarser time scales and short-term synaptic plasticity on finer time scales. These results suggest that short-term plasticity plays a role in the neural computations guiding behavior. Although short-term plasticity is believed to play a fundamental role in cortical computation, empirical evidence bearing on its role during behavior is scarce. Here we looked for the signature of short-term plasticity in the fine-timescale spiking relationships of a simultaneously recorded population of physiologically identified pyramidal cells and interneurons, in the medial prefrontal cortex of the rat, in a working memory task. On broader timescales, sequentially organized and transiently active neurons reliably differentiated between different trajectories of the rat in the maze. On finer timescales, putative monosynaptic interactions reflected short-term plasticity in their dynamic and predictable modulation across various aspects of the task, beyond a statistical accounting for the effect of the neurons' co-varying firing rates. Seeking potential mechanisms for such effects, we found evidence for both firing pattern–dependent facilitation and depression, as well as for a supralinear effect of presynaptic coincidence on the firing of postsynaptic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2086711900,"Close relatedness has long been considered crucial to the evolution of eusociality. However, it has recently been suggested that close relatedness may be a consequence, rather than a cause, of eusociality. We tested this idea with a comparative analysis of female mating frequencies in 267 species of eusocial bees, wasps, and ants. We found that mating with a single male, which maximizes relatedness, is ancestral for all eight independent eusocial lineages that we investigated. Mating with multiple males is always derived. Furthermore, we found that high polyandry (&gt;2 effective mates) occurs only in lineages whose workers have lost reproductive totipotency. These results provide the first evidence that monogamy was critical in the evolution of eusociality, strongly supporting the prediction of inclusive fitness theory."
https://openalex.org/W2163199882,"The mapping of numbers onto space is fundamental to measurement and to mathematics. Is this mapping a cultural invention or a universal intuition shared by all humans regardless of culture and education? We probed number-space mappings in the Mundurucu, an Amazonian indigene group with a reduced numerical lexicon and little or no formal education. At all ages, the Mundurucu mapped symbolic and nonsymbolic numbers onto a logarithmic scale, whereas Western adults used linear mapping with small or symbolic numbers and logarithmic mapping when numbers were presented nonsymbolically under conditions that discouraged counting. This indicates that the mapping of numbers onto space is a universal intuition and that this initial intuition of number is logarithmic. The concept of a linear number line appears to be a cultural invention that fails to develop in the absence of formal education."
https://openalex.org/W2117882329,"Horizontal gene transfer in metazoans has been documented in only a few species and is usually associated with endosymbiosis or parasitism. By contrast, in bdelloid rotifers we found many genes that appear to have originated in bacteria, fungi, and plants, concentrated in telomeric regions along with diverse mobile genetic elements. Bdelloid proximal gene-rich regions, however, appeared to lack foreign genes, thereby resembling those of model metazoan organisms. Some of the foreign genes were defective, whereas others were intact and transcribed; some of the latter contained functional spliceosomal introns. One such gene, apparently of bacterial origin, was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and yielded an active enzyme. The capture and functional assimilation of exogenous genes may represent an important force in bdelloid evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2163609588,"Ferritins are the main iron storage proteins found in animals, plants, and bacteria. The capacity to store iron in ferritin is essential for life in mammals, but the mechanism by which cytosolic iron is delivered to ferritin is unknown. Human ferritins expressed in yeast contain little iron. Human poly (rC)–binding protein 1 (PCBP1) increased the amount of iron loaded into ferritin when expressed in yeast. PCBP1 bound to ferritin in vivo and bound iron and facilitated iron loading into ferritin in vitro. Depletion of PCBP1 in human cells inhibited ferritin iron loading and increased cytosolic iron pools. Thus, PCBP1 can function as a cytosolic iron chaperone in the delivery of iron to ferritin."
https://openalex.org/W1595078459,"Alzheimer's disease is the most common dementia and is pathologically characterized by deposition of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) into beta-amyloid plaques, neuronal injury and low-level, chronic activation of brain immunity. Transforming growth factor-betas (TGF-betas) are pleiotropic cytokines that have key roles in immune cell activation, inflammation and repair after injury. We genetically interrupted TGF-beta and downstream Smad2/3 signaling (TGF-beta-Smad2/3) in innate immune cells by inducing expression of CD11c promoter-driven dominant-negative TGF-beta receptor type II in C57BL/6 mice (CD11c-DNR), crossed these mice with mice overexpressing mutant human amyloid precursor protein, the Tg2576 Alzheimer's disease mouse model, and evaluated Alzheimer's disease-like pathology. Aged double-transgenic mice showed complete mitigation of Tg2576-associated hyperactivity and partial mitigation of defective spatial working memory. Brain parenchymal and cerebrovascular beta-amyloid deposits and Abeta abundance were markedly (up to 90%) attenuated in Tg2576-CD11c-DNR mice. This was associated with increased infiltration of Abeta-containing peripheral macrophages around cerebral vessels and beta-amyloid plaques. In vitro, cultures of peripheral macrophages, but not microglia, from CD11c-DNR mice showed blockade of classical TGF-beta-activated Smad2/3 but also showed hyperactivation of alternative bone morphogenic protein-activated Smad1/5/8 signaling and increased Abeta phagocytosis. Similar effects were noted after pharmacological inhibition of activin-like kinase-5, a type I TGF-beta receptor. Taken together, our results suggest that blockade of TGF-beta-Smad2/3 signaling in peripheral macrophages represents a new therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease."

https://openalex.org/W2136681379,"The protons and neutrons in a nucleus can form strongly correlated nucleon pairs. Scattering experiments, in which a proton is knocked out of the nucleus with high-momentum transfer and high missing momentum, show that in carbon-12 the neutron-proton pairs are nearly 20 times as prevalent as proton-proton pairs and, by inference, neutron-neutron pairs. This difference between the types of pairs is due to the nature of the strong force and has implications for understanding cold dense nuclear systems such as neutron stars."
https://openalex.org/W1982763980,"Expression of p16(Ink4a) and p19(Arf) increases with age in both rodent and human tissues. However, whether these tumour suppressors are effectors of ageing remains unclear, mainly because knockout mice lacking p16(Ink4a) or p19(Arf) die early of tumours. Here, we show that skeletal muscle and fat, two tissues that develop early ageing-associated phenotypes in response to BubR1 insufficiency, have high levels of p16(Ink4a) and p19(Arf). Inactivation of p16(Ink4a) in BubR1-insufficient mice attenuates both cellular senescence and premature ageing in these tissues. Conversely, p19(Arf) inactivation exacerbates senescence and ageing in BubR1 mutant mice. Thus, we identify BubR1 insufficiency as a trigger for activation of the Cdkn2a locus in certain mouse tissues, and demonstrate that p16(Ink4a) is an effector and p19(Arf) an attenuator of senescence and ageing in these tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1964904380,"Leptin (encoded by Lep) controls body weight by regulating food intake and fuel partitioning. Obesity is characterized by leptin resistance and increased endocannabinoid tone. Here we show that leptin infused into the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) of rats inhibits white adipose tissue (WAT) lipogenesis, which occurs independently of signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) signaling. Correspondingly, transgenic inactivation of STAT3 signaling by mutation of the leptin receptor (s/s mice) leads to reduced adipose mass compared to db/db mice (complete abrogation of leptin receptor signaling). Conversely, the ability of hypothalamic leptin to suppress WAT lipogenesis in rats is lost when hypothalamic phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling is prevented or when sympathetic denervation of adipose tissue is performed. MBH leptin suppresses the endocannabinoid anandamide in WAT, and, when this suppression of endocannabinoid tone is prevented by systemic CB1 receptor activation, MBH leptin fails to suppress WAT lipogenesis. These data suggest that the increased endocannabinoid tone observed in obesity is linked to a failure of central leptin signaling to restrain peripheral endocannabinoids."

We present an optical spectrum of the Cassiopeia A supernova near maximum brightness, obtained from observations of a scattered light echo more than three centuries after the direct light of the explosion swept past Earth. The spectrum shows that Cassiopeia A was a type IIb supernova and originated from the collapse of the helium core of a red supergiant that had lost most of its hydrogen envelope before exploding. Our finding concludes a long-standing debate on the Cassiopeia A progenitor and provides new insight into supernova physics by linking the properties of the explosion to the wealth of knowledge about its remnant."

https://openalex.org/W1978367598,"More than 500 million people worldwide are persistently infected with hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus1. Although both viruses are poorly cytopathic, persistence of either virus carries a risk of chronic liver inflammation, potentially resulting in liver steatosis, liver cirrhosis, end-stage liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma. Virus-specific T cells are a major determinant of the outcome of hepatitis, as they contribute to the early control of chronic hepatitis viruses, but they also mediate immunopathology during persistent virus infection1,2,3,4. We have analyzed the role of platelet-derived vasoactive serotonin during virus-induced CD8+ T cell–dependent immunopathological hepatitis in mice infected with the noncytopathic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. After virus infection, platelets were recruited to the liver, and their activation correlated with severely reduced sinusoidal microcirculation, delayed virus elimination and increased immunopathological liver cell damage. Lack of platelet-derived serotonin in serotonin-deficient mice normalized hepatic microcirculatory dysfunction, accelerated virus clearance in the liver and reduced CD8+ T cell–dependent liver cell damage. In keeping with these observations, serotonin treatment of infected mice delayed entry of activated CD8+ T cells into the liver, delayed virus control and aggravated immunopathological hepatitis. Thus, vasoactive serotonin supports virus persistence in the liver and aggravates virus-induced immunopathology."
https://openalex.org/W2074987160,"Here we describe a novel role for the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway in mediating induction of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in response to IL-1. Pharmacological inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibited IL-6 mRNA and protein production. Overexpression of either dominant-negative AKT or IkappaB kinase alpha mutant, IKKalphaT23A, containing a mutation in a functional AKT phosphorylation site, shown previously to be important for NFkappaB activation, completely abrogated IL-6 promoter activation in response to IL-1. However, mutation of the consensus NFkappaB site on the IL-6 promoter did not abrogate promoter activation by IL-1 in contrast to the AP-1 site mutation. IL-1 induces phosphorylation of IKKalpha on the NFkappaB inducing kinase (NIK) phosphorylation sites Ser(176)/Ser(180) and on the Thr(23) site, and although phosphorylation of IKKalphaT23 is inhibited both by LY294002 and wortmannin, phosphorylation of Ser(176)/Ser(180) is not. Neither inhibition of PI 3-kinase/AKT nor IKKalphaT23A overexpression affected IkappaBalpha degradation in response to IL-1. Only partial inhibition by dominant-negative AKT and no inhibitory effect of IKKalphaT23A was observed on an IL-6 promoter-specific NFkappaB site in contrast to significant inhibitory effects on the AP-1 site. Taken together, we have discovered a novel PI 3-kinase/AKT-dependent pathway in response to IL-1, encompassing PI 3-kinase/AKT/IKKalphaT23 upstream of AP-1. This novel pathway is a parallel pathway to the PI 3-kinase/AKT upstream of NFkappaB and both are involved in IL-6 gene transcription in response to IL-1."

https://openalex.org/W2059536899,"Biological feedback mechanisms regulate fundamental ecosystem processes and potentially regulate ecosystem productivity. To date, no studies have documented the down-regulation of terrestrial nitrogen (N) fixation via an ecosystem-level feedback mechanism. Herein, we demonstrate such a feedback in boreal forests. Rapid cycling of N in early secondary succession forests yielded greater throughfall N deposition, which in turn decreased N fixation by cyanobacterial associates in feather moss carpets that reside on the forest floor. The forest canopy exerts a tight control on biotic N input at a period of high productivity."
https://openalex.org/W2154631064,"Transport across cellular membranes is an essential process that is catalyzed by diverse membrane transport proteins. The turnover rates of certain transporters are inhibited by their substrates in a process termed trans-inhibition, whose structural basis is poorly understood. We present the crystal structure of a molybdate/tungstate ABC transporter (ModBC) from Methanosarcina acetivorans in a trans-inhibited state. The regulatory domains of the nucleotide-binding subunits are in close contact and provide two oxyanion binding pockets at the shared interface. By specifically binding to these pockets, molybdate or tungstate prevent adenosine triphosphatase activity and lock the transporter in an inward-facing conformation, with the catalytic motifs of the nucleotide-binding domains separated. This allosteric effect prevents the transporter from switching between the inward-facing and the outward-facing states, thus interfering with the alternating access and release mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2070845549,"The coupling of hemoglobin sensing of physiological oxygen gradients to stimulation of nitric oxide (NO) bioactivity is an established principle of hypoxic blood flow. One mechanism proposed to explain this oxygen-sensing-NO bioactivity linkage postulates an essential role for the conserved Cys93 residue of the hemoglobin beta-chain (betaCys93) and, specifically, for S-nitrosation of betaCys93 to form S-nitrosohemoglobin (SNO-Hb). The SNO-Hb hypothesis, which conceptually links hemoglobin and NO biology, has been debated intensely in recent years. This debate has precluded a consensus on physiological mechanisms and on assessment of the potential role of SNO-Hb in pathology. Here we describe new mouse models that exclusively express either human wild-type hemoglobin or human hemoglobin in which the betaCys93 residue is replaced with alanine to assess the role of SNO-Hb in red blood cell-mediated hypoxic vasodilation. Substitution of this residue, precluding hemoglobin S-nitrosation, did not change total red blood cell S-nitrosothiol abundance but did shift S-nitrosothiol distribution to lower molecular weight species, consistent with the loss of SNO-Hb. Loss of betaCys93 resulted in no deficits in systemic or pulmonary hemodynamics under basal conditions and, notably, did not affect isolated red blood cell-dependent hypoxic vasodilation. These results demonstrate that SNO-Hb is not essential for the physiologic coupling of erythrocyte deoxygenation with increased NO bioactivity in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2169200799,"Defective axonal transport has been proposed as an underlying mechanism that may give rise to neurodegeneration. We investigated the effect of phosphorylation on the axonal transport of tau, a neuronal protein that stabilizes microtubules and is hyperphosphorylated and mislocalized in Alzheimer's disease. We report here that specific inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) reduces tau phosphorylation and significantly decreases the overall rate of axonal transport of tau in rat cortical neurons. Tau mutants, with serine/threonine targets of GSK-3 mutated to glutamate to mimic a permanent state of phosphorylation, were transported at a significantly increased rate compared to wild-type tau. Conversely, tau mutants, in which alanine replaced serine/threonine to mimic permanent dephosphorylation, were transported at a decreased rate compared to wild-type tau. We also found that tau interacts with the light chain of kinesin-1 and that this is dependent on the phosphorylation state of tau. Tau phosphorylation by GSK-3 increased binding, and dephosphorylated tau exhibited a reduced association with kinesin-1. We conclude that GSK-3 phosphorylation of tau modulates its axonal transport by regulating binding to kinesin-1. Hyperphosphorylated tau in Alzheimer's disease appearing first in distal portions of axons may result from aberrant axonal transport of phosphorylated tau reported here."

We quantified the effects of temperature and accumulation variability on firn layer thickness by simulating the 1980–2004 Antarctic firn depth variability. For most of Antarctica, the magnitudes of firn depth changes were comparable to those of observed ice sheet elevation changes. The current satellite observational period (∼15 years) is too short to neglect these fluctuations in firn depth when computing recent ice sheet mass changes. The amount of surface lowering in the Amundsen Sea Embayment revealed by satellite radar altimetry (1995–2003) was increased by including firn depth fluctuations, while a large area of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet slowly grew as a result of increased accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W2020844013,"Exosomes are vesicles secreted by most hematopoietic cells on fusion of multivesicular endosomes with the plasma membrane. Many studies have reported that exosomes may also be released by tumor cells. Exosomes are believed to play an antitumor role through immune cells. We asked whether tumor exosomes have biological activities on tumor cells. We report that human pancreatic tumor nanoparticles, exosome-like as characterized by proteomic analyses and rich in lipid rafts, decreased tumor cell proliferation. Nanoparticles increased Bax and decreased Bcl-2 expressions. Caspase-3 and -9 but not caspase-8 inhibitors impaired apoptosis, which implicates the mitochondria apoptotic pathway. The ceramide-sphingomyelin apoptotic pathway was inoperative. Moreover, nanoparticles induced phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) -3beta activation and decreased pyruvate dehydrogenase activity. In nanoparticle-treated cells, PTEN formed complexes with actin, beta-catenin, and GSK-3beta. Thus, beta-catenin may no longer be available to activate the survival pathway. Nanoparticles triggered the down-regulation of cyclin D1 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Hence, nanoparticles counteracted the constitutively activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt survival pathway to drive tumor cells toward apoptosis. Our study provides the first evidence of an apoptotic function of tumor-derived nanoparticles on tumor cells. We propose a new role for nanoparticles, i.e., as signal carriers for interaction between cells, which may have implications in physiopathological situations."
https://openalex.org/W2005682519,"Micrometer-sized bubbles are unstable and therefore difficult to make and store for substantial lengths of time. Short-term stabilization is achieved by the addition of amphiphilic molecules, which reduce the driving force for dissolution. When these molecules crystallize on the air/liquid interface, the lifetime of individual bubbles may extend over a few months. We demonstrated low gas-fraction dispersions with mean bubble radii of less than 1 micrometer and stability lasting more than a year. An insoluble, self-assembled surfactant layer covers the surface of the microbubbles, which can result in nanometer-scale hexagonal patterning that we explain with thermodynamic and molecular models. The elastic response of the interface arrests the shrinkage of the bubbles. Our study identifies a route to fabricate highly stable dispersions of microbubbles."

Here we have used directed protein evolution to generate hyperthermostable variants of a thermophilic GH11 xylanase, EvXyn11. The Gene Site Saturation Mutagenesis™ (GSSM) methodology employed assesses the influence on thermostability of all possible amino acid substitutions at each position in the primary structure of the target protein. The 15 most thermostable mutants, which generally clustered in the N-terminal region of the enzyme, had melting temperatures (Tm) 1–8°C higher than the parent protein. Screening of a combinatorial library of the single mutants identified a hyperthermostable variant, EvXyn11TS, containing seven mutations. EvXyn11TS had a Tm ∼ 25 °C higher than the parent enzyme while displaying catalytic properties that were similar to EvXyn11. The crystal structures of EvXyn11 and EvXyn11TS revealed an absence of substantial changes to identifiable intramolecular interactions.

The mechanisms by which enzymes display resistance to environmental extremes such as temperature, pH, and protease attack is of considerable biological and industrial importance. Thermostability is a particularly important feature of industrial enzymes as it can extend their effective residence times under process conditions and thereby decrease the cost of these biocatalysts. Indeed, enzymes are used in several biotechnological processes, exemplified by the paper pulp and animal feed sectors, which operate at elevated temperatures. It is not surprising, therefore, that there have been extensive studies on the structural features of thermostable enzymes that confer resistance to inactivation at elevated temperatures (see Refs. 1Adams M.W. Kelly R.M. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 329-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 2Eisenthal R. Peterson M.E. Daniel R.M. Danson M.J.

Trends Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 515-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar for review). Sequence comparisons of thermostable enzymes and their mesophilic counterparts have been useful in identifying “thermostabilizing” residues or motifs that suggest evolutionary adaptations to heat challenge (4Mueller U. Perl D. Schmid F.X. Heinemann U. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 975-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 5Perl D. Mueller U. Heinemann U. Schmid F.X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 380-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Such approaches, however, are limited as only a minority of the sequence differences will impart increased stability, whereas the majority of primary structure variation reflects genetic drift. Comparisons of the three-dimensional structure of thermophilic and mesophilic enzymes have been used in efforts to develop general rules that can be applied to improving the stability of industrially useful biocatalysts. These data have, not surprisingly, shown that thermostable enzymes tend to have a more compact structure in which the loops are shorter, the hydrophobic cores are more densely packed, and there are more extensive polar interactions (6Razvi A. Scholtz J.M. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 1569-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Despite this wealth of information the use of rational design to improve thermostability continues to be challenging. Most site-directed mutagenesis approaches designed to increase non-covalent interactions have resulted in only modest improvements in stability (7Zhang W. Mullaney E.J. Lei X.G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2007; 73: 3069-3076Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), although the introduction of disulfide bridges can sometimes have dramatic effects (8Xiong H. Fenel F. Leisola M. Turunen O. Extremophiles. 2004; 8: 393-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 9Yang H.M. Yao B. Meng K. Wang Y.R. Bai Y.G. Wu N.F. J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2007; 34: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To date, general rules for increasing stability by rational design that can be applied to any enzyme without compromising activity, remain elusive. The use of random mutagenesis to explore the mechanism of thermostability is an attractive approach as this methodology introduces a small number of amino acid changes, which can be directly linked to increased stability. The structures of thermostable enzyme variants generated by error prone PCR have largely confirmed that an increase in hydrophobic packing and direct hydrogen bonds confers enhanced protein stability (10Andrews S.R.

The observed increases in stability, however, are again relatively modest (3–8 °C), and this methodology only examines a small proportion of the amino acid sequence space as single base changes to the codons limits the number of possible changes at each position in the primary sequence. Furthermore, these studies mainly focus on the conversion of mesophilic enzymes, with temperature stabilities ranging from 40 to 60 °C, into thermophilic biocatalysts that are stable between 60 and 70 °C. The amino acid changes required to generate hyperthermophilic enzymes that retain activity close to 100 °C have not been explored by error prone PCR. A more systematic approach to random mutagenesis is gene site saturation mutagenesis (GSSM), 4The abbreviations used are:GSSMgene site saturation mutagenesisGHglycoside hydrolaser.m.s.root mean squareTStemperature sensitive. which completely randomizes successive codons in a gene to evaluate the influence of all possible amino acid substitutions, at each position in the primary sequence, on the properties of the protein (12Garrett J.B.

Consequently, the structural analysis of variants generated by GSSM will be invaluable in dissecting the mechanisms by which proteins can be effectively stabilized with minimal amino acid substitution. In this report we have utilized GSSM technology to generate a hyperthermophilic variant of the catalytic module of a glycoside hydrolase family (GH) 11 (15Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2651) Google Scholar) xylanase (the full-length enzyme is defined as EvXyn11fl and the catalytic module as EvXyn11). This target was chosen because xylanases are widely used in industrial processes that operate at high temperatures, or require a heating cycle exemplified by the paper pulp and animal feed sectors, respectively (16Beg Q.K.

Comparison of the crystal structure of EvXyn11 and EvXyn11TS showed that only one of the seven amino acid changes significantly increased direct interactions within the protein, whereas the other mutations mediated substantial improvements in stability through very subtle changes to the structure of the enzyme. These data demonstrate the power of comprehensive molecular forced evolution, compared with rational design, in converting a thermostable enzyme into a hyperthermophilic variant and point to the requirement for new tools to interrogate protein folding at nonambient temperatures. gene site saturation mutagenesis glycoside hydrolase root mean square temperature sensitive. GSSM Library Construction and Screening—DNA encoding the catalytic module of EvXyn11 (nucleotides 64–646) was amplified by PCR using primers that introduced a stop codon after nucleotide 646. The amplified fragment was cloned into the pSE420-CHis vector (Invitrogen Corp.) and the GSSM procedure was performed as previously described (19Gray K.A. Richardson T.H. Kretz K. Short J.M.

Patent 6, 280, 926,Google Scholar) using 64-fold degenerate oligonucleotides to effect full randomization of each codon. The products of each individually randomized codon were transformed into Escherichia coli strain XL1-Blue MR, to generate sublibraries for each trinucleotide sequence in the gene. Sequencing of 20 clones each from 14 libraries recovered at least the expected stochastic number of unique amino acids for a fully degenerate codon library, and indicated that no codon biases were present. To ensure complete coverage of the introduced sequence diversity, 360 colonies (∼6-fold coverage) from each codon library were assayed for catalytic activity and thermostability, giving a total number of ∼70,000 colonies screened (360 × 194 codons). This level of oversampling translates to a 99.3% probability of obtaining all 20 amino acids, where a 50% probability of complete coverage is reached at 110 colonies (Fig. 1). Screening for clones expressing thermostable xylanase variants is described below. High-throughput Thermotolerance Screen—Given the large size of the library, a robust high-throughput screen was required to identify the best thermotolerant mutants. A colorimetric xylanase assay using 2% birchwood azo-xylan (Megazyme) at pH 8.5 was adapted for 384-well microtiter plates and optimized in an automated robotic screening format. Individual clones were arrayed into 384-well microtiter plates (Corning) containing 40 μl of Luria-Bertani (LB) medium with carbenicillin at 100 μg/ml using a colony picking robot (Auto-Gen), such that a collection of clones representing one randomized residue was placed into 360 wells of a microtiter plate. The remaining 24 wells were inoculated with positive and negative control clones. The positive control comprised the E. coli strain expressing the wild-type enzyme and the negative control was the pSE420-CHis vector in E. coli XL1-Blue MR. The plates were incubated in a humidified incubator at 37 °C until saturated cultures of uniform density appeared. These plates were then replicated using a hand-held 384-well pintool into fresh LB medium with antibiotic and incubated at 37 °C overnight. The bacterial cultures were lysed by addition of 10 μl/well of CellLytic B-II cell lysis reagent (Sigma) and incubated at ambient temperature for 30 min. The plates were then incubated on custom-designed benchtop heaters (Verenium Corp.) at 76 °C for 20 min. Following the thermal challenge step, 30 μl/well of 2% azo-xylan (Birchwood, Megazyme) solution was added using a robotically controlled arm, microplate dispenser, and incubator (Verenium Corp technology). The plates were incubated at 60 °C for 2 h, after which, 20 μl/well of the reaction mixture were transferred (Apricot Designs liquid handler) to a chilled 384-well plate containing 70 μl/well of ethanol and mixed. The 384-well plates were centrifuged at ∼1800 × g for 5 min. The supernatant (30 μl/well) was transferred to a clear 384-well plate (Corning) and absorbance was measured at 590 nm to determine residual activity of the mutants relative to the control samples. In the primary screen the temperature of the heat challenge was 76 °C. Under those conditions the parent enzyme still retains about 10% of its activity. Those clones displaying at least 50% greater residual activity than the wild-type enzyme were tagged as putative hits. After screening the library, 1340 putative hits were identified and retrieved from archival plates. These were arrayed in new 384-well plates in quadruplicate, and screened again under the same assay conditions as the primary screen. Clones for which 3 of 4 replicates exceeded the minimum activity threshold (50% improvement over wild type) were identified as hits in the secondary screen stage and were retained for further screening. DNA sequencing identified 69 genetically unique variants with greater thermal tolerance than the parent enzyme EvXyn11. These mutants were assayed under the same conditions as the secondary screen but with progressively more stringent thermochallenge temperatures of 76, 80, 84, and 88 °C. All of the mutants had at least 50% greater residual activity over wild-type enzyme after the heat challenge of 76 °C, whereas at 80 and 84 °C, the mutants displayed varying levels of residual activity, permitting ranking of the hits in order of their observed thermostability. None of the mutants displayed activity after the 88 °C challenge. GeneReassembly Library Construction—The GeneReassembly library was constructed (22Short, J. M. (March 25, 2003) U. S. Patent 6, 537, 776Google Scholar) from 15 combinatorial segments that blended individual codon changes that conferred enhanced thermostability on the encoded enzyme. The library of xylanase genes were cloned into the pSE420-CH vector and transformed into E. coli XL1-Blue MR cells. The resultant combinatorial library contained 12,288 possible unique variants (210 × 3 × 4 = 12,288). This derives from the fact that at each of 10 positions there are two possible codons to combine (wild type or mutant codon), whereas at position 13, there are three possible codons (wild type (Thr) and two mutants (Phe and Tyr)), and at position 34, there are four possible codons (wild-type (Gln) and the mutants Cys, His, and Leu). Sequencing of a portion of the library confirmed that the distribution of variants closely matched the theoretical distribution (Fig. 2). Approximately 40,000 clones from the library were robotically picked, arrayed into archival 384-well plates, replicated into assay plates, and screened for increased thermotolerance. After a primary screen at 76 °C, similar to the GSSM screen, 1000 hits were selected. This number was reduced to 190 after a secondary screen at 86 °C. All of these 190 hits were screened at progressively higher heat-challenge temperatures and longer heat challenge times to assess the performance limits of the top variants. Protein Purification—EvXyn11, single amino acid variants, EvXyn11TS, and the full-length protein EvXyn11fl were purified by cation exchange chromatography and size exclusion chromatography using a Hi Load™ Superdex™ 200 that was run in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl. For crystallographic studies the eluted protein was exchanged into ddH2O using a 10-kDa cut off VIVA-spin concentrator. Enzyme Assays—The xylanase activity of EvXyn11 and EvXyn11TS was determined at 37 °C as described by Charnock et al. (23Charnock S.J. Lakey J.H. Virden R. Hughes N. Sinnott M.L. Hazlewood G.P.

Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals of EvXyn11TS (21 g/liter in ddH20) were grown at 20 °C for 2 to 3 days in 55% (w/v) PEG 400, 0.15 m lithium sulfate, 0.1 m trisodium acetate, pH 5.1, and were cryo-protected in the mother liquor. Crystals of EvXyn11 were grown at 20 °C in 12% (w/v) PEG 8000, 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 9, over 2 to 3 days and were cryo-cooled in the mother liquor containing 30% (v/v) glycerol. A total of 250° of diffraction data were each recorded from single crystals of EvXyn11 and EvXyn11TS to a maximum resolution of 1.8 and 1.9 Å, respectively, at 100 K using a RAXIS-IV image plate detector mounted on a MicroMax 007 (copper 1.5418 Å) rotating anode x-ray source. Structure Solution—The diffraction data were integrated in MOSFLM (25Leslie A.G.W. Newsletter Protein Crystallography. Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1992Google Scholar) and scaled in SCALA (26Evans P. CCP4 Daresbury Study Weekend 29–30 January 1993.

Crystals of EvXyn11TS belonged to space group C2, with unit cell dimensions of a = 64.7 Å, b = 33.6 Å, c = 83.1 Å, α = 90.0°, β = 101.9°, γ = 90.0°, and with one molecule occupying the crystallographic asymmetric unit. The structure of EvXyn11TS was solved by molecular replacement in MOLREP using a previously determined structure of the Bacillus circulans XynA (PDB accession number 1xnb), as the search model.

The enzyme comprises 346 amino acids and features an N-terminal signal peptide followed by a 194-residue GH11 catalytic module, which is appended, via a short serine-rich linker, to a ∼100-amino acid C-terminal module of unknown function. The enzyme displays greatest sequence similarity with the Saccharophagus degradans xylanase-xylan esterase Xyn11B-Axe4A (GenBank accession number CP000282) with the respective GH11 catalytic modules displaying 74% identity. A recombinant form of the catalytic module of EvXyn11fl (EvXyn11), which was purified to >95% electrophoretic purity, displays catalytic activities typical of GH11 xylanases. It rapidly hydrolyzes oat-spelled xylan with a kcat of 155,000 ± 2,700 min-1 and Km of 2.6 ± 1.4 mg/ml (Table 2), and has a pH optimum of 8.0 using oat-spelled xylan and 7.2 when 4-nitrophenyl-β-d-xylotrioside was the substrate. The native enzyme is thermostable exhibiting a temperature optimum of 65 °C and, in its apo form, is not subject to thermal inactivation up to 60 °C. Differential scanning calorimetry showed that the native xylanase had melting temperatures of 76.2 °C. The stability of the full-length xylanase, EvXyn11fl, was similar to EvXyn11 displaying a Tm of 74.5 °C and a 50% loss of activity after incubation for 15 min at 64 °C, compared with 66 °C for the catalytic module (see below). The thermodynamics of thermal unfolding could not be investigated further as precipitation rendered the process irreversible. Attempts to measure the ΔG between the folded and unfolded form of the xylanase were also unsuccessful as circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that the protein could not be denatured even when incubated for 3 months in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride at 37 °C (data not shown).TABLE 2Catalytic activity and wild type EvXyn11 and its derivatives The substrate used to measure xylanase activity was oat spelt xylan.EvXyn11 derivativeProtein concentrationkcatKmkcat/Kmnmmin–1mg ml–1min–1 mg–1 mlWild type1.25155,000 ± 27,0002.6 ± 1.459,615EvXyn11TS1.25139,000 ± 16,0002.4 ± 1.057,916S71T1.25155,000 ± 16,0003.5 ± 0.944,295 Open table in a new tab Isolation of EvXyn11 Variants That Display Increased Thermostability—GSSM was used to explore how amino acid substitutions influenced the thermostability of EvXyn11. Using the GSSM methodology, variants of the enzyme, each containing a single amino acid substitution, were generated in which all 20 possible amino acids were introduced at each position in the primary sequence. Quality assessment sequencing of 20 clones each from 14 libraries recovered the expected stochastic number of unique amino acids for a fully degenerate codon library, and indicated that no codon biases were present (Fig. 1). To ensure complete coverage of the introduced sequence diversity, 360 colonies (∼6-fold coverage) from each codon library were assayed for catalytic activity and thermostability. The screen identified 69 genetically unique variants (0.5% of the total number of variants) with greater thermal tolerance than the parent EvXyn11. All of these mutants had at least 50% greater residual activity over wild type after a heat challenge of 76 °C, whereas none of the mutants displayed residual activity after incubation at 88 °C. The 15 most thermostabilizing mutations (T4L, S9P, Q10S, T13F, T13Y, N14H, Y18F, S25E, N30V, Q34C, Q34H, Q34L, S35E, S71T, and S194H) were combined in all possible combinations using GeneReassembly technology. The resultant combinatorial library contained 12,288 possible unique variants. Sequencing of a portion of the library confirmed that the distribution of variants closely matched the theoretical distribution (Fig. 2). Screening 4 × 104 clones from this library for enhanced thermostability revealed 200 clones, the majority of which contained 7–9 mutations (Fig. 2), which retained significant xylanase activity after a heat challenge at 86 °C. Screening at progressively higher challenge temperatures identified a hyperthermostable variant (EvXyn11TS; GenBank accession number EU591743) that retained full activity after incubation at 90 °C for 60 min when screening lysed bacteria. It should be noted, however, that the xylanase within the concentrated viscous cellular contents of the lysed bacteria is more stable than the purified form of the enzyme (see below). EvXyn11TS contains the 7 mutations, S9P, T13F, N14H, Y18F, Q34L, S35E, and S71T. Detailed Characterization of the Thermostable EvXyn11 Variants—The catalytic activities of the single amino acid variants S9P, N14H, T13F, Y18F, Q34L, S35E, and S71T and EvXyn11TS, purified to electrophoretic homogeneity, were broadly similar to the wild-type enzyme (data not shown). Differential scanning calorimetry of each EvXyn11 thermostable variant revealed an elevated Tm ranging from 1 to 8 °C above that of the wild-type enzyme. The combined mutant, EvXyn11TS, had a Tm of 101 °C, which is 25 °C higher than the parent xylanase (Table 3). As with the wild-type enzyme the thermal unfolding of each mutant was irreversible. EvXyn11 and EvXyn11TS lost 50% of their catalytic activity after incubation for 15 min at 66 and 91 °C, respectively (Fig. 3), whereas the pseudo-first order rate constants for thermal inactivation at 73 °C were 0.573 ± 0.054 min-1 for EvXyn11 and 0.0026 ± 0.00029 min-1 for EvXyn11TS (Fig. 3). Collectively, the thermal inactivation studies are consistent with the Tm data in demonstrating that the seven mutations introduced"

Interact. 1998; 111: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In some patients, the generation and urinary excretion of 5-oxoproline has been reported to be up to 50 g/day. This extraordinary production of 5-oxoproline and associated acidosis has been considered to be a significant factor in the pathology associated with this deficiency. The inhibition of GGCT in cases of glutathione synthetase deficiency would block the degradation of γ-glutamylcysteine and allow its accumulation to a level where it may partially substitute for glutathione in redox and detoxification reactions. Thus, there is potential therapeutic value in designing specific inhibitors of GGCT. Deficiency of 5-oxoprolinase, the enzyme that catalyzes the ATP-dependent decyclization of 5-oxoproline to glutamate, has been reported in several patients and also leads to 5-oxoprolinuria (4–10 g/day) (7Ristoff E. Larsson A. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1998; 111: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This indicates that there is a significant turnover of glutathione and γ-glutamyl-amino acid dipeptides via GGCT and the γ-glutamyl cycle under normal metabolic conditions. The position of GGCT in the γ-glutamyl cycle suggests that it could play a significant role in regulating the synthesis of glutathione by limiting the availability of γ-glutamylcysteine; however, this possibility has not been critically investigated.

Hered. 1980; 30: 248-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), and multiple isoforms have been detected in rat and human tissues. An early study using starch gel electrophoresis identified a genetic polymorphism in mouse GGCT and mapped the locus by linkage to Lyt-2 on mouse chromosome 6 (13Tulchin N. Taylor B.A. Genetics. 1981; 99: 109-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite these previous studies and the significant role this enzyme plays in the γ-glutamyl cycle, a cDNA encoding a GGCT has never been cloned, and nothing is known of its sequence, structure, or genomic organization. In this study, we have cloned a cDNA encoding human GGCT and determined its primary amino acid sequence and gene structure. Bioinformatics analysis has identified related sequences in many animal species but has not identified sequence similarity with any other protein of known function. We have also expressed functional recombinant enzyme and determined its crystal structure. GGCT has a novel fold that contains an unusual overlapping β strand motif and is a member of a small family of proteins of unknown function that have been identified by structural genomics projects. Thus, we have identified the first function attributed to this new protein family. GGCT was partially purified from expired human red blood cells that were generously provided by the Australian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service. The purification procedure followed the DEAE-cellulose and ammonium sulfate steps that were previously described (11Board P.G. Moore K.A. Smith J.E. Biochem. J. 1978; 173: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and the presence of the enzyme was detected in chromatographic fractions by a spectrophotometric assay that used γ-glutamyl-l-alanine as a substrate (14Board P.G. Smith J.E. Moore K. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1978; 91: 127-131PubMed Google Scholar). The active fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining, and the GGCT band was specifically identified by Western blotting with a rabbit antiserum raised against previously purified human erythrocyte GGCT (11Board P.G. Moore K.A. Smith J.E. Biochem. J. 1978; 173: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The band corresponding to the GGCT was excised from the Coomassie Blue-stained gel and subjected to trypsin digestion and mass spectrometry analysis by the Australian Proteome Analysis Facility. An IMAGE consortium kidney cDNA clone (BC019243) was used as a template with the primers hGCTSF 5′-GTACCGCGGTGGCATGGCCAACTCGGGCTG and hGCTNR 5′-AATGCGGCCGCGCACATAGAATACCCTTAG to amplify the GGCT coding sequence by PCR. The amplified product (629 bp) was cloned into pGEM-T (Promega) and sequenced to confirm the absence of amplification errors. All DNA sequencing was on an ABI 3730 sequencer (Australian Cancer Research Foundation Biomolecular Resource Facility, John Curtin School of Medical Research, Australian National University) following the manufacturer's protocol (Applied Biosystems). The cloned cDNA was excised from the pGEM-T vector with KspI and NotI ligated into the same sites in the pHUE vector (15Catanzariti A.M. Soboleva T.A. Jans D.A. Board P.G. Baker R.T. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1331-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and transfected into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). Expression of recombinant enzymes in pHUE allows the rapid purification of the expressed protein by Ni2+-agarose chromatography and the subsequent removal of all additional NH2-terminal residues by cleavage with the catalytic domain of mouse ubiquitin-specific protease 2, as previously described in detail (15Catanzariti A.M. Soboleva T.A. Jans D.A. Board P.G. Baker R.T. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1331-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Some minor contaminating proteins remained, so the enzyme was subjected to an additional step of ion exchange chromatography. The protein was dialyzed into 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, fractionated on a 1 × 12-cm column of DEAE-Sepharose with a linear gradient to 0.2 m potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, containing 1 m NaCl. The eluted fractions containing GGCT activity were pooled, and if not used immediately, the enzyme was stored frozen at -20 °C. Selenomethionine-labeled GGCT was expressed using the same vector but grown under modified conditions, as described by Van Duyne et al. (16Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). The labeled GGCT was purified as described above and transferred into 20 mm Tris/HCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.0, while being concentrated after the DEAE ion exchange chromatography step. A continuous spectrophotometric method that links the production of free alanine to the oxidation of NADH via the action of added glutamate-pyruvate transaminase and lactate dehydrogenase was used, as previously described (14Board P.G. Smith J.E. Moore K. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1978; 91: 127-131PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetic constants were determined by varying the γ-glutamyl-l-alanine concentration between 0.5 and 30 mm over seven steps in triplicate. The rate data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation by the MacCurveFit version 1.5 program (Kevin Raner Software). Western blots were performed as described by Towbin et al. (17Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar). The antiserum against GGCT was raised in rabbits against purified human erythrocyte GGCT or recombinant human GGCT expressed in E. coli. The antibodies were diluted (1:1000) in PBS with 1% skim milk. After a 1-h incubation with the primary antibody and washing, the membrane was incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (1:8000; DAKO) for 1 h and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. Bound antibodies were visualized by using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Amersham Biosciences). Wild Type Structure—A 2-μl sample of selenomethionine containing GGCT (15 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris/HCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.0) was mixed with equal volumes of γ-Glu-Glu dipeptide (40 mm) and well solution. The well contained 1 ml of a solution comprising PEG 4000 (22.5% w/v), 100 mm sodium formate buffer, pH 3.9, 200 mm ammonium acetate. Crystals appeared as flat rods within 7 days and reached maximum size (longest edge 200 μm) after 20 days. For cryoprotection, crystals were transferred to artificial mother liquor containing 32.5% PEG 4000 prior to placement in a cryostream at 100 K. After collection and integration of peak and inflection anomalous data (Table 1), the structure was solved automatically with HKL3000 (18Minor W. Cymborowski M. Otwinowski Z. Chruszcz M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar) as follows. Eight selenium sites were found by SHELXD (19Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar). (This is consistent with a dimer in the asymmetric unit, since GGCT contains four methionine residues not including the NH2-terminal methionine.) RESOLVE (20Terwilliger T. J. Synchrot. Radiat. 2004; 11: 49-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) detected noncrystallographic 2-fold symmetry based on the selenium sites. The heavy atom search was followed by 10 cycles of solvent flattening in SHELXE (19Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar) using map contrast and connectivity to assign the correct enantiomorph. Data between 50 and 3.0 Å resolution was used for obtaining initial MAD phases. After heavy atom refinement and phase calculation in MLPHARE (21Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the mean figure of merit for phases in this resolution range was 0.27. The program DM (22Cowtan K.D. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) was used to improve phases through solvent flattening, histogram mapping, noncrystallographic symmetry averaging, and phase extension. The resulting electron density maps were sufficient for RESOLVE to automatically build 80% of the protein structure. The “peak” x-ray data were used for these rounds of structure refinement. All reflection data were used for electron density map generation, model building, and structure refinement.TABLE 1X-ray and structure dataParameterValuePeakInflectionNative structure Protein Data Bank code2PN7 Space GroupP212121 Unit cell (Å,degrees)a = 35.2, b = 98.7, c = 100.7 Wavelength (Å)0.979340.97948 Resolution (Å)50.0-2.40 (2.49-2.40)aValues in parentheses refer to highest resolution bin50-2.4 (2.49-2.40) 〈I/σI〉11.14 (2.09)10.8 (1.65) R-merge (%)bR-merge = ΣhΣi|Ihi – 〈Ih〉|/ΣhΣiIh13.3 (48.6)14.8 (44.1) Completeness (%)98.3 (90.2)97.2 (85.6) Unique reflections13,898 (1257)13,931 (1208) sAverage redundancy6.1 (3.3)4.9 (2.5) AtomsProtein2681Water34 R-factor, R-free (%)cR-factor = Σh||Fo| – |Fc||/Σ|Fo|, where Fo and Fc are the observed and calculated structure factors, respectively.

A 2-μl sample of protein (15 mg/ml) was mixed with equal volumes of 20 mm γ-Glu dipeptides (either γ-Glu-Phe, γ-Glu-Glu, γ-Glu-Cys, γ-Glu-Gly, or γ-Glu-Ala) and well solution before being suspended over the well in a hanging drop configuration. The well solution was composed of 0.1 m potassium acetate buffer, pH 4.25, 20% PEG 4000, and 0.2 m ammonium acetate. The largest crystals grew from solutions containing γ-Glu-Phe (longest edge 200 μm) and appeared after 3 days and grew to maximum dimensions after 1 week. For x-ray data collection, crystals were cryoprotected by transfer to artificial mother liquor with PEG 4000 concentration increased to 30%. Crystals were snap-frozen using an Oxford cryostream at 100 K. Data were collected using a Mar345 Dtb image plate system mounted on a Rigaku RU200 rotating anode x-ray generator with mirrors. Data were processed with the HKL package. Structure refinement started with the previously determined wild type structure. Gln98 Mutant Structure—Crystals were grown at 4 °C. A 4-μl sample of protein (160 mg/ml) was mixed with 2 μl of 100 mm γ-Glu peptides (as for Ala98) and 2 μl of well solution prior to suspension over the well in a hanging drop configuration. The largest crystals grew in the presence of γ-Glu-Cys (longest edge 300 μm). The well solution was composed of 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, 30% PEG 4000, and 0.2 m ammonium acetate. Crystals appeared after 3 days and grew to maximum dimensions after 1 week. Prior to x-ray data collection, crystals were cryoprotected by transfer to artificial mother liquor with PEG 4000 concentration increased to 35%. Crystals were snap-frozen using an Oxford cryostream at 100 K. Data were collected using a Mar 165-mm CCD at the Australian Synchrotron. Data were processed with Mosflm (23Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1696-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) and scaled with Scala (24Evans P.R. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

For all three models, model building and refinement was conducted using REFMAC5 (25Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Statistics for the final models are given in Table 1. Identification of a GGCT cDNA Clone—Human GGCT was partially purified from human erythrocytes by ion exchange chromatography and ammonium sulfate precipitation. The presence of the enzyme was confirmed by a specific spectrophotometric assay and detection on Western blots with an antiserum raised against highly purified human erythrocyte GGCT in an earlier study (11Board P.G. Moore K.A. Smith J.E. Biochem. J. 1978; 173: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Although the partially purified preparation contained several components, a relatively strong ∼21-kDa Coomassie Blue-stained band that corresponded to the most prominent band detected on Western blots was selected for further investigation. Trypsin digest and mass spectrum analysis revealed five peptides that gave 46% coverage of a previously undescribed protein known as C7orf24 (chromosome 7 open reading frame 24) (accession number Hs.530024). The C7orf24 protein appeared to be a good candidate, since its predicted molecular mass is around 21-kDa, and its position on chromosome 7 is syntenic with the previously mapped location of the mouse Ggct gene on chromosome 6 (13Tulchin N. Taylor B.A. Genetics. 1981; 99: 109-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the EST data base revealed many C7orf24 cDNA clones, and we selected one (BC019243) from human kidney for further study. The longest open reading frame within the selected EST clone was amplified and cloned in the pHUE expression vector. Characterization of Recombinant Human GGCT—Subsequent expression and purification of recombinant protein from the C7orf24 cDNA generated a protein with a molecular size on SDS-PAGE of ∼21 kDa, and a Western blot revealed that the expressed protein cross-reacted strongly with the original antiserum raised against purified human erythrocyte GGCT (Fig. 2). To further confirm that this protein was GGCT, we measured its activity with γ-glutamyl-l-alanine as a substrate. The recombinant enzyme was very active and had a specific activity of 50.3 μmol/min/mg. Some kinetic properties of the recombinant enzyme are shown in Table 2. Thus, as a result of the immunological cross-reactivity and the enzymatic activity, we conclude that the EST clone identified in this study encodes a functional GGCT enzyme.TABLE 2Specific activity and kinetic parameters for recombinant human GGCT with γ-glutamyl-l-alanine as a substrate The results for the recombinant protein are the mean and S.D.

The sequences were aligned by the program ClustalW (29Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J.

Although we found related sequences in a range of species from Caenorhabditis elegans to mammals, the best matches were in higher species, and further studies will be needed to determine if the diverged proteins identified in species such as Drosophila melanogaster, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (echinoderm), and Caenorhabditis elegans encode proteins with GGCT activity. The BLAST search did not identify any similar proteins in plants, although a protein with GGCT activity has been detected in tobacco (30Steinkamp R. Schweinhofen B. Rennenberg H. Physiol. Plant. 1987; 69: 499-503Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It was particularly notable that the GGCT sequence showed no similarity to other previously described proteins of known function, including glutaminyl cyclases that catalyze the formation of pyroglutamate at the amino termini of peptides (31Huang K.F.

The crystals were orthorhombic and belonged to the space group P212121. The unit cell parameters and space group (Table 1) were consistent with a dimer in the asymmetric unit with a Matthews coefficient of 2.08 Å3/dalton. The structure comprises a dimer with continuous electron density observable for residues 14–182 in monomer A and residues 15–183 in monomer B as well as 34 water molecules. No electron density is apparent for the NH2-terminal 13 (monomer A) or 14 (monomer B) residues. Similarly, the COOH-terminal regions are disordered, with no density observed for the last 6 (monomer A) or 5 (monomer B) residues in the sequence. Nevertheless, the electron density maps corresponding to the final model are of high quality (Fig. 4), and the model statistics are satisfactory (Table 1). The enzyme adopts a mixed α/β topology with six β-strands, five α-helices, and four short 310 helices (Fig. 5). Strands 1–5 form a barrel structure. Strands 2 and 3 extend beyond this barrel and twist around each other, forming a 120° elbow and reversing their topological order. The helices are loosely clustered around strands β1, β2, β3, and β6. Dimerization interactions occur across strand β4, which lies adjacent to the noncrystallographic 2-fold axis, forming a continuous β-sheet with its noncrystallographic symmetry-related partner (Fig. 5). Other dimerization interactions lie between strand β3 and 310-helix 4. Because of the moderate resolution of the x-ray data, water molecules were built into electron density in a conservative manner, resulting in lower average B-factor for water compared with protein (Table 1).FIGURE 5The structure and topology of GGCT.

There is electron density within this site that cannot be explained by the presence of a water molecule but cannot easily be interpreted as substrate or reaction product.

https://openalex.org/W2022386942,"Reversible topoisomerase I (Top1)-DNA cleavage complexes are the key DNA lesion induced by anticancer camptothecins (e.g. topotecan and irinotecan) as well as structurally perturbed DNAs (e.g. oxidatively damaged DNA, UV-irradiated DNA, alkylated DNA, uracil-substituted DNA, mismatched DNA, gapped and nicked DNA, and DNA with abasic sites). Top1 cleavage complexes arrest transcription and trigger transcription-dependent degradation of Top1, a phenomenon termed Top1 down-regulation. In the current study, we have investigated the role of Top1 down-regulation in the repair of Top1 cleavage complexes. Using quiescent (serum-starved) human WI-38 cells, camptothecin (CPT) was shown to induce Top1 down-regulation, which paralleled the induction of DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) (assayed by comet assays) and ATM autophosphorylation (at Ser-1981). Interestingly, Top1 down-regulation, induction of DNA SSBs and ATM autophosphorylation were all abolished by the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Furthermore, studies using immunoprecipitation and dominant-negative ubiquitin mutants have suggested a specific requirement for the assembly of Lys-48-linked polyubiquitin chains for CPT-induced Top1 down-regulation. In contrast to the effect of proteasome inhibition, inactivation of PARP1 was shown to increase the amount of CPT-induced SSBs and the level of ATM autophosphorylation. Together, these results support a model in which Top1 cleavage complexes arrest transcription and activate a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway leading to the degradation of Top1 cleavage complexes. Degradation of Top1 cleavage complexes results in the exposure of Top1-concealed SSBs for repair through a PARP1-dependent process."
https://openalex.org/W2113183580,"Leucascandrolide A and neopeltolide are structurally homologous marine natural products that elicit potent antiproliferative profiles in mammalian cells and yeast. The scarcity of naturally available material has been a significant barrier to their biochemical and pharmacological evaluation. We developed practical synthetic access to this class of natural products that enabled the determination of their mechanism of action. We demonstrated effective cellular growth inhibition in yeast, which was substantially enhanced by substituting glucose with galactose or glycerol. These results, along with genetic analysis of determinants of drug sensitivity, suggested that leucascandrolide A and neopeltolide may inhibit mitochondrial ATP synthesis. Evaluation of the activity of the four mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes in yeast and mammalian cells revealed cytochrome bc(1) complex as the principal cellular target. This result provided the molecular basis for the potent antiproliferative activity of this class of marine macrolides, thus identifying them as new biochemical tools for investigation of eukaryotic energy metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1963576357,"Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is a water-selective transport protein expressed in glial cells throughout the central nervous system. AQP4 deletion in mice produces alterations in several neuroexcitation phenomena, including hearing, vision, epilepsy, and cortical spreading depression. Here, we report defective olfaction and electroolfactogram responses in AQP4-null mice. Immunofluorescence indicated strong AQP4 expression in supportive cells of the nasal olfactory epithelium. The olfactory epithelium in AQP4-null mice had identical appearance, but did not express AQP4, and had approximately 12-fold reduced osmotic water permeability. Behavioral analysis showed greatly impaired olfaction in AQP4-null mice, with latency times of 17 +/- 0.7 vs. 55 +/- 5 s in wild-type vs. AQP4-null mice in a buried food pellet test, which was confirmed using an olfactory maze test. Electroolfactogram voltage responses to multiple odorants were reduced in AQP4-null mice, with maximal responses to triethylamine of 0.80 +/- 0.07 vs. 0.28 +/- 0.03 mV. Similar olfaction and electroolfactogram defects were found in outbred (CD1) and inbred (C57/bl6) mouse genetic backgrounds. Our results establish AQP4 as a novel determinant of olfaction, the deficiency of which probably impairs extracellular space K(+) buffering in the olfactory epithelium."

Sulfanylalkanols, 3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol in particular, form one key class of the odoriferous compounds. A conjugate with the dipeptide Cys-Gly has been reported as the secreted precursor for 3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol. Here, we confirm the Cys-Gly-(S) conjugate as the major precursor of this odorant, with lower levels of the Cys-(S) conjugate being present in axilla secretions. The enzymatic release of 3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol from the Cys-Gly-(S) conjugate by the axilla isolate Corynebacterium Ax20 was thus investigated. Cellular extracts of Ax20 released 3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol from the Cys-Gly-(S) conjugate and from the Cys-(S) conjugate, whereas the previously isolated C-S lyase of this bacterial strain was only able to cleave the Cys-(S) conjugate. o-Phenanthroline blocked the release from the Cys-Gly-(S) conjugate but did not affect cleavage of the Cys-(S) conjugate, indicating that in a first step, a metal-dependent dipeptidase hydrolyzes the Cys-Gly bond. This enzyme was purified by four chromatographic steps and gel electrophoresis, and the partial amino acid sequence was determined. The corresponding gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. It codes for a novel dipeptidase with a high affinity toward the Cys-Gly-(S) conjugate of 3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol. Co-incubating either the synthetic Cys-Gly-(S) conjugate or fresh axilla secretions with both the C-S lyase and the novel dipeptidase did release 3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol, proving that the sequential action of these two enzymes from the skin bacterium Corynebacterium Ax20 does release the odorant from the key secreted precursor."
https://openalex.org/W2047614561,"An important consequence of protein misfolding related to neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is the formation of proteinaceous inclusions or aggregates within the central nervous system. We have previously shown that several familial ALS-linked copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) mutants (A4V, G85R, and G93A) interact and co-localize with the dynein-dynactin complex in cultured cells and affected tissues of ALS mice. In this study, we report that the interaction between mutant SOD1 and the dynein motor plays a critical role in the formation of large inclusions containing mutant SOD1. Disruption of the motor by overexpression of the p50 subunit of dynactin in neuronal and non-neuronal cell cultures abolished the association between aggregation-prone SOD1 mutants and the dynein-dynactin complex. The p50 overexpression also prevented mutant SOD1 inclusion formation and improved the survival of cells expressing A4V SOD1. Furthermore, we observed that two ALS-linked SOD1 mutants, H46R and H48Q, which showed a lower propensity to interact with the dynein motor, also produced less aggregation and fewer large inclusions. Overall, these data suggest that formation of large inclusions depends upon association of the abnormal SOD1s with the dynein motor. Whether the misfolded SOD1s directly perturb axonal transport or impair other functional properties of the dynein motor, this interaction could propagate a toxic effect that ultimately causes motor neuron death in ALS."
https://openalex.org/W1968203524,"The actin filament is quite dynamic in the cell. To determine the relationship between the structure and the dynamic properties of the actin filament, experiments using actin mutants are indispensable. We focused on Gln(137) to understand the relationships between two activities: the conformational changes relevant to the G- to F-actin transition and the activation of actin ATPase upon actin polymerization. To elucidate the function of Gln(137) in these activities, we characterized Gln(137) mutants of human cardiac muscle alpha-actin. Although all of the single mutants, Q137E, Q137K, Q137P, and Q137A, as well as the wild type were expressed by a baculovirus-based system, only Q137A and the wild type were purified to high homogeneity. The CD spectrum of Q137A was similar to that of the wild type, and Q137A showed the typical morphology of negatively stained Q137A F-actin images. However, Q137A had an extremely low critical concentration for polymerization. Furthermore, we found that Q137A polymerized 4-fold faster, cleaved the gamma-phosphate group of bound ATP 4-fold slower, and depolymerized 5-fold slower, as compared with the wild-type rates. These results suggest that Gln(137) plays dual roles in actin polymerization, in both the conformational transition of the actin molecule and the mechanism of ATP hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1985562398,"Destabilization of activator-DNA complexes by the proteasomal ATPases can inhibit transcription by limiting activator interaction with DNA. Modification of the activator by monoubiquitylation protects the activator from this destabilization activity. In this study, we probe the mechanism of this protective effect of monoubiquitylation. Using novel label transfer and chemical cross-linking techniques, we show that ubiquitin contacts the ATPase complex directly, apparently via Rpn1 and Rpt1. This interaction results in the dissociation of the activation domain-ATPase complex via an allosteric process. A model is proposed in which activator monoubiquitylation serves to limit the lifetime of the activator-ATPase complex interaction and thus the ability of the ATPases to unfold the activator and dissociate the protein-DNA complex.

The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is responsible for most of the non-lysosomal proteolysis in eukaryotic cells (1Baumeister W. Walz J. Zuhl F. Seemuller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). The 26 S proteasome is comprised of a 20 S core particle (CP) 3The abbreviations used are: CP, core particle; RP, regulatory particle; Ub, ubiquitin; mono-Ub, monoubiquitin; poly-Ub, polyubiquitin; AD, activation domain; DBF, DOPA-biotin-FlAsH; DOPA, dihydroxyphenylalanine; SUMO, small ubiquitin-like modifier; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; DBD, DNA-binding domain; DMP, 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanol; Suc, N-succinyl; AMC, 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin. 3The abbreviations used are: CP, core particle; RP, regulatory particle; Ub, ubiquitin; mono-Ub, monoubiquitin; poly-Ub, polyubiquitin; AD, activation domain; DBF, DOPA-biotin-FlAsH; DOPA, dihydroxyphenylalanine; SUMO, small ubiquitin-like modifier; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; DBD, DNA-binding domain; DMP, 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanol; Suc, N-succinyl; AMC, 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin. that contains the three active sites inside of a barrel-like enclosure. The 20 S CP is capped on either end with the 19 S regulatory particle (RP). The 19 S RP is comprised of ∼20 proteins including a ring of six ATPases (Rpt1-6) that sit atop the 20 S CP and are thought to unfold substrate proteins and feed them into the interior of the barrel. Several lines of evidence published over the last few years have revealed that the proteasome and its subcomplexes are intimately involved in RNA polymerase II transcription, as well as other nuclear processes. Recent studies in yeast using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-on-chip) have shown that a large fraction of active genes are occupied either by the 26 S proteasome or by independent 19 S RP or 20 S CP complexes (2Sikder D. Johnston S.A. Kodadek T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27346-27355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 3Auld K.L. Brown C.R. Casolari J.M. Komilli S. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 861-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Genetic links between proteasomal proteins and polymerase II transcription have long been known. For example, specific alleles of SUG1 and SUG2 (sug1-1 and sug2-1), genes that encode two of the proteasomal ATPases (Rpt 4 and Rpt6), could rescue the activity of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae Gal4 transactivator derivative lacking about two-thirds of the C-terminal activation domain (Gal4D) (4Swaffield J.C. Bromberg J. Johnston S.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 698-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) by a mechanism that could not be explained by altered proteolysis of Gal4D (5Russell S.J. Johnston S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9825-9831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). What was the biochemical basis of this genetic link between GAL transcription in yeast and the proteasomal ATPases? Investigation into this question demonstrated that the activation domain (AD) of Gal4 binds directly to Sug1/Rpt6 and Sug2/Rpt4 and extracts from the proteasome a complex that includes the six ATPases, Rpn1, Rpn2, and perhaps other associated proteins but not the 20 S core proteasome or the “lid” subunit of the 19 S RP (6Gonzalez F. Delahodde A. Kodadek T. Johnston S.A. Science. 2002; 296: 548-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). This proteasomal subcomplex, which has been called APIS or the 19 S base (we will use the latter term here), is recruited to GAL promoters by Gal4 and is important for efficient promoter escape and elongation (7Ferdous A. Gonzalez F. Sun L. Kodadek T. Johnston S.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 981-991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 8Ferdous A. Kodadek T. Johnston S.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12798-12805Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The proteasomal ATPases are also important for efficient promoter escape in other systems (9Lassot I. Latreille D. Rousset E. Sourisseau M. Linares L.K. Chable-Bessia C. Coux O. Benkirane M. Kiernan R.E. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 369-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although the precise mechanistic basis of this effect has yet to be determined, a plausible model is that the protein unfolding activity of the ATPases, when uncoupled from proteolysis, acts to somehow remodel the preinitiation complex into an elongation complex, a process that is known to require many alterations in protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions (10Saunders A. Core L.J. Lis J.T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Others later demonstrated that Rpt6, presumably acting in concert with the other proteins in the 19 S base, is also important in mediating histone modifications and in recruiting the SAGA complex to promoters. Neither of these activities require proteolysis (11Ezhkova E. Tansey W.P. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 435-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 12Lee D.H. Ezhkova E. Li B. Pattenden S.G. Tansey W.P. Workman J.L. Cell. 2005; 123: 423-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Until recently, one confusing aspect of the published data on the interaction of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway with GAL gene transcription was the fact that the sug1-1 and sug2-1 mutations were clearly recessive. This is difficult to reconcile with the requirement of Rpt6 protein activity for elongation. Instead, it seems more likely that the sug1-1 and sug2-1 mutations eliminated some repressive activity of the wild-type complex to which Gal4D is hypersensitive. We recently discovered the molecular basis of this putative repressive activity. Specifically, the transactivator-DNA complex is rapidly and reversibly dissociated in an ATP-dependent manner by the proteasomal ATPases in a non-proteolytic fashion (13Ferdous A. Sikder D. Gillette T.G. Nalley K. Kodadek T. Johnston S.A. Genes Dev. 2007; 20: 112-123Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The direct interaction of the ATPases and the AD of the transactivator are essential for this reaction to occur. How do wild-type activators resist this potent activity of the proteasomal ATPases and remain associated with the promoter long enough to drive high level transcription? Although it is true that some activators are thought to undergo rapid exchange with their DNA-binding sites in vivo (14McNally J.G. Müller W.G. Walker D. Wolford R. Hager G.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar), others, including heat shock factor (HSF) (15Yao J. Munson K.M. Webb W.W. Lis J.T. Nature. 2006; 442: 1050-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), do not. We found that the answer lies in the post-translational modification of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (DBD). When exposed to a HeLa nuclear extract, all of the DNA-bound activator is phosphorylated 4A. Ferdous, M. O'Neal, K. Nalley, D. Sikder, S. A. Johnston, and T. Kodadek, submitted for publication. 4A. Ferdous, M. O'Neal, K. Nalley, D. Sikder, S. A. Johnston, and T. Kodadek, submitted for publication. and monoubiquitylated (Ub) (13Ferdous A. Sikder D. Gillette T.G. Nalley K. Kodadek T. Johnston S.A. Genes Dev. 2007; 20: 112-123Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and this form of the protein is insensitive to the destabilization activity of the 19 S base. Inefficient monoubiquitylation was found to be the defect of Gal4D (16Archer C.T. Delahodde A. Gonzalez F. Johnston S.A. Kodadek T. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12614-12623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and it was shown that this results in an inability of the activator to bind stably to promoters in vivo in the face of the “stripping” activity of the proteasomal ATPases. Consistent with this view, Gal4D function can be rescued by massive overexpression, which drives GAL promoter occupancy even in the absence of activator monoubiquitylation (17Matsumoto K. Adachi Y. Toh-e A. Oshima Y. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 508-527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This defect can also be partially overcome by genetic fusion of monoubiquitin to Gal4D, indicating that the stereochemical positioning of the monoubiquitin moiety on the protein is not critical. As mentioned above, Gal4D function in vivo is also rescued by the suppressing mutations sug1-1 or sug2-1. We showed that proteasome subcomplexes isolated from these strains have reduced destabilization activity in vitro relative to the wild-type ATPase complex (16Archer C.T. Delahodde A. Gonzalez F. Johnston S.A. Kodadek T. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12614-12623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In summary, these studies have demonstrated a novel aspect of the regulation of Gal4 promoter occupancy in vivo. Gal4 binding to DNA is directly antagonized by the stripping activity of the proteasomal ATPases, but the activator is immunized against this repressive activity by monoubiquitylation of the DNA-binding domain. However, the mechanism by which ubiquitin protects activators from destabilization remains obscure. In this report, we employ a variety of methods, including novel label transfer chemistry, to address this question. First, we confirm that activator monoubiquitylation, and not some other potential modification, is indeed the key to stabilizing the activator-promoter complex. Second, we demonstrate that although mono-Ub does not bind directly to the intact 26 S proteasome, it does engage directly with the 19 S base after it has been extracted from the proteasome by the activator. Evidence is presented that this interaction is the result of direct contact of Ub with Rpt1 and Rpn1. We show that these Ub-19 S base interactions result in the dissociation of the AD-Rpt4/Rpt6 contacts, apparently via an allosteric mechanism. The end result is that the lifetime of the activator-ATPase complex is reduced by Ub, resulting in inhibition of the stripping activity. A model that attempts to integrate these findings with the requirement for the ATPases in promoter escape and elongation is proposed. Materials—CCPGCC-Ub was constructed by including CCPGCC into the 5′ primer of a pair of PCR primers (FLAG FlAsH Ub F, 5′-GCGGAAGCTTTGCTGCCCGGGTTGCTGCGCGGGAATTTTTGTCAAGACAC-3′; FLAG FlAsH Ub R, 5′-GGGGTACCCCCACCCCTCAACCTCAAGACAAGGTG-3′) designed for an Ub expression plasmid. The PCR product was digested with HindIII and KpnI and inserted into the pT7-FLAG-1 vector (Sigma P 1118). This fusion protein was expressed and purified according to manufacturer's directions (Sigma). 26 S and 19 S proteasomes were purified using a FLAG affinity tag as described (18Verma R. Chen S. Feldman R. Schieltz D. Yates J. Dohmen J. Deshaies R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3425-3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) with modifications (7Ferdous A. Gonzalez F. Sun L. Kodadek T. Johnston S.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 981-991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). GST-Gal4-(1-147)-VP16, GST-Gal4-(1-147), GST-Gal4 AD, GST-UBL, His6-SUMO, His6-Gal80, and His6-Ub were purified from Escherichia coli BL21 cells as described (7Ferdous A. Gonzalez F. Sun L. Kodadek T. Johnston S.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 981-991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Lys-48-linked tetra-Ub chains were from Boston Biochem. Antibodies against PentaHis (Qiagen), ubiquitin (Dako Cytomation), GST (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), NeutrAvidin-HRP (Pierce), and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad) were used according to instructions. The α-Rpt6, α-Rpt4, α-Rpt1, α-Gal4 N terminus, α-Gal6, and α-20 S antibodies were produced in rabbit. α-Rpn1 and α-Rpn2 were produced in mouse. The DOPA-biotin-FlAsH chimera (DBF) cross-linking reagent (19Liu B. Archer C.T. Burdine L. Gillette T.G. Kodadek T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 12348-12349Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and the DOPA-Gal4 AD peptide have been described (20Archer C.T. Burdine L. Kodadek T. Mol. BioSystems. 2005; 1: 366-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Destabilization of Activator-DNA Complexes by the Proteasome—The destabilization assay has been described previously (13Ferdous A. Sikder D. Gillette T.G. Nalley K. Kodadek T. Johnston S.A. Genes Dev. 2007; 20: 112-123Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar) with the following changes. The activator-DNA complex was added at a 60 nm final concentration of activator-DNA complex to the reaction mix containing 25 nm 26 S proteasome, 3 mm ATP, and 1 μm non-biotinylated DNA containing Gal4-binding sites in TR reaction buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 50 mm KCl, 6.25 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2% glucose (v/v)). The reaction was treated with 3 units of hexokinase without ATP or 100 nm MG132 for Fig. 1B. Antibody inhibition was done by the addition of 0.8 μg of the purified antibody indicated. Destabilization in the presence of mono-Ub, tetra-Ub, or small Ub-like modifier (SUMO) was done by adding the indicated amount of protein to the reaction mix immediately before the addition of the activator-DNA complex. Ubiquitylation Reaction—The monoubiquitylation of GST-Gal4-VP16 has been described (13Ferdous A. Sikder D. Gillette T.G. Nalley K. Kodadek T. Johnston S.A. Genes Dev. 2007; 20: 112-123Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The non-ubiquitylated controls were done exactly as stated, but 3 units of hexokinase were used, and the ATP was omitted. Pulldowns—The GST-protein/proteasome pulldowns were performed by mixing 1 μm GST containing protein with 50 nm 26 S proteasome in TR reaction buffer. After a 30-min incubation at 4 °C, glutathione agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added for 30 min. The beads were washed with TR reaction buffer and resuspended in SDS loading buffer for Western blot analysis. The GST-protein/His6-Ub experiments were performed as above but contained 10 μm His6-Ub or His6-Gal80. Pulldowns to detect ubiquitylated GST-Gal4-VP16/proteasome interactions were done by incubating the activator-DNA complex after the ubiquitylation reaction with 110 nm 26 S proteasome in 30 μl of TR buffer containing 3 units of hexokinase. After 30 min at room temperature, the pellets were washed extensively with TR buffer. The pellets were resuspended with SDS loading buffer and run on SDS-PAGE for Western blot analysis. Cross-linking/Label Transfer Reactions—Cross-linking followed by label transfer to detect DOPA-Gal4 AD/proteasome interactions have been described (20Archer C.T. Burdine L. Kodadek T. Mol. BioSystems. 2005; 1: 366-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 21Burdine L. Gillette T.G. Lin H.-J. Kodadek T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 11442-11443Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The proteins indicated in the figure were added to the reaction mix at the same time as peptide addition. Cross-linking to detect mono-Ub/proteasome interaction was done as described (19Liu B. Archer C.T. Burdine L. Gillette T.G. Kodadek T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 12348-12349Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) with the following changes. 110 nm 26 S or 19 S proteasome was mixed with 10 μm CCPGCC-Ub in TR reaction buffer. After 10 min, 10 μm DBF was added and incubated for 10 min in the dark. The reaction was triggered with 5 mm IO4−, and after 2 min, SDS loading buffer containing 100 mm 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanol (DMP or British Anti-Lewisite BAL) was added to quench the reaction and transfer the DBF label to the cross-linked partner. Experiments that included GST-Gal4-VP16 to dissociate 26 S proteasome were done as above, but 100 nm GST-Gal4-VP16 was added to the proteasome for 15 min at room temperature before adding mono-Ub and completing the reaction. The experiment conducted to identify the targets of Ub in the proteasome was scaled up 5-fold relative to that described above (20Archer C.T. Burdine L. Kodadek T. Mol. BioSystems. 2005; 1: 366-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 21Burdine L. Gillette T.G. Lin H.-J. Kodadek T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 11442-11443Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For the reactions employing recombinant Rpt proteins, six different E. coli strains expressing one ATPase in the pET-28a vector (Novagen) (kindly provided by G. DeMartino, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center) were grown in individual 1-liter LB cultures to mid-log phase, and expression of the ATPase was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 2 h of induction, cells were pelleted at 4000 rpm for 15 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, 6.25 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol with a protease inhibitor tab (Roche Applied Science)) and lysed by sonication. After centrifugation at 17,000 rpm for 20 min, the protein concentration of the lysate was measured. For cross-linking reactions, 1 mg of total lysate was mixed with 10 mm CCPGCC-Ub and 1 mm of the DBF reagent in a 100-ml reaction. The protein mix was allowed to incubate for 10 min at room temperature, and the reaction was triggered and quenched as above. The reaction was run on SDS-PAGE, and the cross-linked product was detected by blotting with NeutrAvidin-HRP. The total amount of His-tagged ATPase was probed with the pentaHis antibody. Peptidolysis and ATPase Assays—The peptidolysis activity of the 26 S was tested using the fluorescent substrate Suc-LLVY-AMC (Bachem). 50 nm substrate was mixed with 7 nm 26 S proteasome and 3 mm ATP in peptidolysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 20 μm mm β-mercaptoethanol). The change in fluorescence (excitation, 360 nm; emission, 465 nm) was monitored for 30 min at room temperature. The indicated proteins were added at 10 μm, and MG132 was added a 100 nm. The graph shows the average change in fluorescence over 30 min from three measurements with one standard deviation of the mean as error. Experiments done in the presence of NaIO4 were done as above with the addition of 5 mm NaIO4. The measurement of ATP hydrolysis by coupling the production of ADP to the oxidation of NADH has been described (22Kreuzer K.N. Jongeneel C.V. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 100: 144-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The absorbance at 340 nm of 5 nm proteasome in the reaction mix was monitored. GST or mono-Ub was included at 10 μm in the indicated lanes. The change in absorbance was converted to nmol of ATP hydrolyzed per minute for three measurements and graphed with one standard deviation of the mean as error. Inhibition of Destabilization Activity of the Proteasome—The destabilization assay was done as stated in the text. 10 μm DOPA-Gal4 AD peptide or the control DOPA-containing peptide (20Archer C.T. Burdine L. Kodadek T. Mol. BioSystems. 2005; 1: 366-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) were added to the proteasome prior to the addition of the activator-DNA complex. The graph in Fig. 1A shows the mean and standard error of the mean for three experiments. Ub Antagonizes Proteasome-mediated Destabilization in Trans—To begin to probe the mechanistic basis of this phenomenon, we first addressed whether it is indeed monoubiquitin that is responsible for the protective effect. The ability of a monoubiquitin fusion to rescue Gal4D (16Archer C.T. Delahodde A. Gonzalez F. Johnston S.A. Kodadek T. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12614-12623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) suggests that this is true, but it was difficult to exclude other modifications in the in vivo system. If monomeric ubiquitin were solely responsible for the protection, it might be possible to observe the inhibition of destabilization by adding ubiquitin to a reaction containing non-ubiquitylated activator-DNA complex. We previously reported a simple in vitro assay to monitor the ability of the proteasomal ATPases to destabilize activator-DNA complexes (13Ferdous A. Sikder D. Gillette T.G. Nalley K. Kodadek T. Johnston S.A. Genes Dev. 2007; 20: 112-123Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar), which is shown schematically in supplemental Fig. S1A. We first validated that the 26 S proteasome responded the same as the 19 S proteasome preparation used previously (supplemental Fig. S1, B and C) before turning to the effect of ubiquitin. As shown in Fig. 1A, the destabilization activity of the purified proteasome (lane 2) was inhibited strongly by adding mono-Ub in trans to a concentration of 10 μm (lane 3). Titration experiments revealed that mono-Ub inhibited destabilization with an IC50 of ∼0.7 μm (supplemental Fig. S1D and Fig. 1B), which was a ∼30-fold molar excess of mono-Ub to 26 S proteasome. Note that this experiment did not involve the use of HeLa nuclear extract and thus cannot be due to attachment of the Ub to the Gal4 DBD, which was confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-Ub (not shown). This result argues that it is indeed the Ub moiety that is key to blocking proteasome-mediated destabilization. Remarkably, the addition of Lys-48-linked tetra-Ub chains (Fig. 1A, lane 4, pUb) did not result in stabilization of the activator-DNA complex, demonstrating a striking difference between the properties of these different forms of the same protein. In addition, when the highly homologous SUMO protein (lane 5) was added in trans at 10 μm, it had little effect on the destabilization activity of the proteasome. We conclude that interaction of monomeric Ub with either the proteasome or the activator is responsible for stabilization of the activator-DNA complex in the presence of the proteasome. Ub Binds Directly to the 19 S RP—To distinguish whether the activator or the proteasome is the target of free Ub, we turned to a novel type of cross-linking/label transfer chemistry developed recently in our laboratory (19Liu B. Archer C.T. Burdine L. Gillette T.G. Kodadek T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 12348-12349Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this method (Fig. 2A), the protein of interest, in this case Ub, is tagged with a short peptide sequence (CCPGCC) that binds tightly and specifically to a biarsenical fluorescein derivative called FlAsH (23Griffin B.A. Adams S.R. Tsien R.Y. Science. 1998; 281: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar, 24Adams S.R. Campbell R.E. Gross L.A. Martin B.R. Walkup G.K. Yao Y. Llopis J. Tsien R.Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 60636-66076Google Scholar). We synthesized a derivative of FlAsH tethered to a biotin moiety and a dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) unit via ethylene glycol linker arms. The catechol ring of the DOPA subunit can be oxidized to an ortho-quinone selectively with sodium periodate under conditions that do not affect proteasome function (supplemental Fig. S2). The quinone is a reactive electrophile that will couple covalently with nearby nucleophilic residues on a receptor protein (Fig. 2A). Extensive control experiments have revealed that cross-linking occurs only when the DOPA-containing molecule and the receptor are closely associated (21Burdine L. Gillette T.G. Lin H.-J. Kodadek T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 11442-11443Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 25Liu B. Burdine L. Kodadek T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 15228-15235Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). When the cross-linked products are boiled in a dithiol-containing buffer prior to electrophoresis, the FlAsH-CCPGCC association is disrupted, resulting in transfer of the biotinylated FlAsH-DOPA reagent to the receptor protein (Fig. 2A). We employed this affinity label transfer method to determine whether Ub binds directly to the proteasome or Gal4-VP16. As shown in Fig. 2B, when 10 μm CCPGCC-Ub and the DBF reagent were incubated with the 26 S proteasome and sodium periodate, no significant labeling of any of the 26 S proteins was detected by SDS-PAGE analysis followed by Western blotting with a NeutrAvidin-HRP conjugate. However, CCPGCC-Ub inhibited destabilization in trans equally as well as His6-Ub (supplemental Fig. S1D, compare lanes 8 and 9), demonstrating that this Ub derivative is active. Significant cross-linking and label transfer was observed when the same experiment was carried out with the 19 S RP rather than the full 26 S proteasome (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 1 and 2). At least two major biotinylated bands were observable, one of ∼55 kDa and a larger species that migrated slightly above the 110-kDa marker. The ability of CCPGCC-Ub to affinity label the 19 S RP but not the 26 S proteasome suggests that the Ub interaction site is obscured in the full 26 S proteasome. As mentioned in the Introduction, the Gal4 and VP16 ADs can extract the 19 S base from intact proteasome via contacts with Rpt4 and Rpt6 (6Gonzalez F. Delahodde A. Kodadek T. Johnston S.A. Science. 2002; 296: 548-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). We wondered whether this activator-19 S base complex would interact with Ub. Adding Gal4-VP16 to the label transfer reaction containing CCPGCC-Ub and the 26 S proteasome indeed resulted in affinity biotinylation of the same bands that were labeled in the 19 S RP-containing experiment (Fig. 2C, compare lane 1 and 2). When CCPGCC-Ub, DBF, and periodate were mixed with GST-Gal4-VP16 in the absence of any proteasomal proteins, no labeled bands were observed (Fig. 2C, lane 3). Thus, the cross-linking/label transfer data indicate an Ub-19 S RP (or 19 S base) interaction but provide no evidence for direct interaction with the activator. Identification of the Ub-proximal Proteins in the 19 S RP—We next turned to identification of the proteins that acquired biotin in the label transfer reaction (Fig. 2C, lane 2). The high molecular weight region of a gel run for a longer period of time to achieve maximal separation of the larger products showed an intense band running just above the 110-kDa marker and a less intense band just below the marker (Fig. 3A, left panel). These bands are approximately the size expected for Rpn1 (upper band) and Rpn2 (lower band), respectively. These assignments were confirmed by aligning the NeutrAvidin-HRP blots with Western blots using antibodies raised against the Rpn1 and Rpn2 subunits. The other major band(s) displayed an apparent mass of slightly above 50 kDa (Fig. 2B). Several proteins in the 19 S RP, including all six ATPases, have similar gel mobilities in this region. Therefore, the label transfer products were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis using isoelectric focusing in the first dimension and SDS-PAGE in the second (Fig. 3B). The major biotin-labeled protein has an isoelectric point of 5.3 and a mass of ∼55 kDa, suggesting that it is the Rpt1 subunit (26Denison C. Kodadek T. J. Proteome Res. 2004; 3: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To confirm this assignment, the membrane was stripped and reprobed with antibodies raised against Rpt1 and Rpt4, the latter being the 19 S protein closest in molecular mass and isoelectric point to Rpt1. The false-colored overlays of the NeutrAvidin-HRP blot with the Western blots against the proteasomal subunits are shown in Fig. 3B, in the lower panels. Note that Rpt1, but not Rpt4, showed an overlap with NeutrAvidin-HRP signal. Because of the nature of the label transfer process, there is always the possibility that labeling of both the Ub-binding protein itself and its nearest neighbors could occur given the length of the chain connecting the DOPA and FlAsH moieties (Fig. 2A). Therefore, to further probe whether Rpt1 is indeed the ATPase targeted by mono-Ub, we repeated the label transfer experiment with crude extracts derived from six different E. coli strains expressing the His6-tagged version of each ATPase (Fig. 3C). The only ATPase to acquire the biotin tag in these experiments was Rpt1 (Fig. 3C, upper panel), although all six ATPases were present at similar levels (lower panel). This argues that Rpt1 is indeed the direct binding partner of mono-Ub. Note that none of the many bacterial proteins present in the extract are labeled, arguing that the Ub-Rpt1 interaction is quite specific. Unfortunately, we do not have recombinant Rpn1 in hand, so we cannot absolutely confirm that this interaction is also direct"

We have expressed heterodimeric full-length and N-terminal fragments of Manduca sexta sGC in Escherichia coli, the first time this has been accomplished for any sGC, and have performed the first functional analyses of an insect sGC. Manduca sGC behaves much like its mammalian counterparts, displaying a 170-fold stimulation by NO and sensitivity to compound YC-1. YC-1 reduces the NO and CO off-rates for the ∼100-kDa N-terminal heterodimeric fragment and increases the CO affinity by ∼50-fold to 1.7 μm. Binding of NO leads to a transient six-coordinate intermediate, followed by release of the proximal histidine to yield a five-coordinate nitrosyl complex (k6-5 = 12.8 s-1). The conversion rate is insensitive to nucleotides, YC-1, and changes in NO concentration up to ∼30 μm. NO release is biphasic in the absence of YC-1 (koff1 = 0.10 s-1 and koff2 = 0.0015 s-1); binding of YC-1 eliminates the fast phase but has little effect on the slower phase. Our data are consistent with a model for allosteric activation in which sGC undergoes a simple switch between two conformations, with an open or a closed heme pocket, integrating the influence of numerous effectors to give the final catalytic rate. Importantly, YC-1 binding occurs in the N-terminal two-thirds of the protein.

The primary NO receptor is soluble guanylyl/guanylate cyclase (sGC), a heterodimeric protein of ∼150 kDa that binds NO through a ferrous heme. NO binding stimulates cyclase activity, the production of cGMP from substrate GTP, and the subsequent amplification of NO-dependent signaling cascades (2Pyriochou A. Papapetropoulos A. Cell.

The primary form of sGC is an α1/β1 heterodimer composed of two evolutionarily related subunits that display several recognizable domains (Fig. 1A) (18Iyer L.M. Anantharaman V. Aravind L. BMC Genomics. 2003; 4: 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Heme is bound to the protein through proximal β1 His-105. NO binding to the heme leads to proximal histidine release and stimulation of cyclase activity, presumably through a change in protein conformation (reviewed in Ref. 19Poulos T.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2006; 16: 736-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The heme-binding domain has evolved from a widespread family of bacterial proteins called H-NOX (Heme-Nitric oxide/OXygen) domain proteins, of which the structures of three are known (20Ma X.

In the 1990s, the anti-platelet activity of YC-1, a benzylindazole derivative (Fig. 1B), was found to derive from its ability to bind to and stimulate sGC (26Friebe A. Schultz G. Koesling D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6863-6868Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 27Ko F.N. Wu C.C. Kuo S.C. Lee F.Y. Teng C.M. Blood. 1994; 84: 4226-4233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), leading to a search for related compounds that might serve as sGC-targeted drugs for human health (28Evgenov O.V. Pacher P. Schmidt P.M. Hasko G. Schmidt H.H. Stasch J.P. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 755-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). The YC-1 mechanism of action remains unclear, as does the location of its binding site in the sGC protein. The nucleotide-like structure of YC-1, in conjunction with mutagenesis studies, has led to the suggestion that YC-1 binds to the cyclase domain (29Lamothe M. Chang F.J. Balashova N. Shirokov R. Beuve A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3039-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), whereas cross-linking studies with YC-1-related compounds have indicated that they bind to the N-terminal domain of the α1 subunit (30Stasch J.-P. Becker E.M. Alonso-Alija C. Apeler H. Gerzer R. Minuth T. Perzborn E. Pleiss U. Schröder H. Schroeder W. Stahl E. Steinke W. Straub A. Schramm M.

Studies of insect sGC have lagged behind studies of the mammalian enzyme, but, as in mammals, insect sGC plays an important physiological role. In the Manduca sexta larva (tobacco hornworm), sGC is implicated in antennal lobe morphogenesis (31Gibson N.J. Rossler W. Nighorn A.J. Oland L.A. Hildebrand J.G. Tolbert L.P. Dev.

The development of insect cell expression systems for mammalian sGC proteins has facilitated mechanistic studies (38Friebe A. Wedel B. Harteneck C. Foerster J. Schultz G. Koesling D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 39Brandish P.E. Buechler W.

A. 2000; 97: 10763-10768Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), but obtaining functional material in sufficient quantity remains a major difficulty in the field. Here we have developed Escherichia coli expression systems for both the full-length Manduca sGC heterodimer (msGC) and for two heterodimeric, N-terminal truncations (msGC-NT1 and msGC-NT2). Our analysis provides the first mechanistic results for an insect-derived sGC. We demonstrate that Manduca sGC behaves much like its mammalian counterparts and that binding of YC-1 occurs within the N-terminal portion of the protein. Materials—Plasmid pCR®2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) was used for cloning PCR products into the expression vector pETDuet1 (Novagen, Milwaukee, WI). PCR primers were obtained from Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX). E. coli strain DH5α was the cloning host and E. coli strains BL21(DE3) pLysS and Rosetta(DE3) pLysS (Novagen) the expression hosts. 2-(N,N-Diethylamino)-diazenolate-2-oxide (DEA/NO) was the kind gift of Dr. Katrina Miranda. YC-1 was obtained from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise described. Expression of Recombinant Manduca sGC in E. coli—Constructs for expression of full-length and truncated msGC α1/β1 (msGC-NT) in E. coli were prepared using the previously described clones obtained from a cDNA library of the Manduca prepupal abdominal nervous system (35Nighorn A. Gibson N.J. Rivers D.M. Hildebrand J.G. Morton D.B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7244-7255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the truncated constructs, DNA fragments corresponding to msGC α1 residues 1–471 (for msGC-NT1) or 49–471 (for msGC-NT2) and msGC β1 residues 1–400 (for both msGC-NT1 and -NT2) were cloned into vector pETDuet1, allowing for expression of both subunits from a single plasmid. The appropriate msGC α1 fragments were obtained from vector pET-28b-Mana1 by PCR amplification using primers 5′-ggatccgatgacgtgtccattcc-3′ (for msGC-NT1) or 5′-ggatccgctcactcttaagcatatgagtg-3′ (for msGC-NT2) and 5′-tcactcgcctagccaaagcctttt-3′. For msGC β1, the appropriate fragment was amplified from pET-17b-Manb1 with primers 5′-catatgtacgggtttgtg-3′ and 5′-tcactcgcctagccaaagcctttt-3′. For the full-length co-expression construct, primers 5′-ggatccgatgacgtgtccattcc-3′ and 5′-actagtcagtcatcatcctgctttg-3′ were used for α1 amplification, and the β1 gene was cut from pET-17b-Manb1 and ligated into pETDuet-1 using the NdeI and EcoRV restriction sites. The final constructs have a His6 tag fused onto the N terminus of the α1 subunit. All pETDuet-1-derived plasmids were verified by sequencing and transformed into BL21 (DE3) pLysS or Rosetta(DE3) pLysS competent cells for expression. Mutations in the H-NOX domain were introduced by PCR using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), with the msGC-NT2 plasmid as the template. The primers used to generate the α1 L211A mutant were 5′-gaaccagtggcgtacgctttagtaggcagtctgaaag-3′ and 5′-ctttcagactgcctactaaagcgtacgccactggttc-3′. For the α1 T223A mutant, primers were 5′-gccatagcgaaacgactggctgatacacagacagac-3′ and 5′-gtctgtctgtgtatcagccagtcgtttcgctatggc-3′. Mutations were confirmed by complete sequencing of the genes. Expression of soluble msGC-NT1 or -NT2 was carried out in the presence of 25 μm δ-aminolevulinate, a heme synthesis precursor. Cells were grown at 30 °C, induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and harvested 6 h later. Purification of Recombinant Manduca sGC from E. coli—All purification steps were performed at 4 °C. Cell pellets were suspended in lysis buffer (50 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl, 25 mg/ml DNase I, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm benzamidine) and disrupted using a French press (1000 p.s.i.). Cell debris was pelleted by low speed centrifugation (GSA rotor, 12,000 rpm for 30 min) and ultracentrifugation (45Ti rotor, 40,000 rpm for 30 min). The clear supernatant was then loaded onto metal affinity resin (Clontech Talon cobalt or Qiagen Ni-NTA (Valencia, CA)) pre-equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline (50 mm NaPO4, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.0). The column was washed with 20 bed volumes of low concentration imidazole in phosphate-buffered saline or EDTA, and the protein was eluted with 150 mm imidazole in phosphate-buffered saline (cobalt) or 100 mm EDTA (Ni-NTA). Brown-colored fractions were pooled, concentrated, and loaded onto a Sephacryl S-200 size-exclusion column (GE Healthcare). Both msGC-NT1 and -NT2 proteins eluted as a major peak at ∼115 ml and were concentrated and buffer-exchanged into protein buffer (50 mm KPO4, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, and 5% glycerol) using a Vivaspin 6 concentrator (Sartorius Corp., Edgewood, NY). Protein concentration was estimated by absorption of the Soret band (see below). The procedure yielded 1–2 mg of highly pure protein per liter of cell culture. The proteins were stored at -80 °C. Full-length msGC was expressed at a lower temperature (17 °C) in Rosetta(DE3) pLysS cells and purified in a similar manner as msGC-NT1 and -NT2, except that only a single metal-affinity column purification step was used because of difficulty with stability. The procedure yielded 0.5–1 mg of partially pure protein per liter of cell culture. UV-visible Spectroscopy—Spectra were recorded on a Cary Bio50 spectrophotometer at room temperature at a scan rate of up to 600 nm/min. In a typical NO binding experiment, a 1-ml sGC sample was deoxygenated in a septum-capped cuvette with an argon stream (30 min), while stirring with a stir bar, before DEA/NO was added using a gas-tight syringe. A DEA/NO stock solution was prepared fresh in 10 mm NaOH and quantified by its absorbance at 250 nm using the extinction coefficient ϵ250 cm-1 = 8000 m-1, a value adjusted to account for incomplete release of NO (41Maragos C.M. Morley D. Wink D.A. Dunams T.M. Saavedra J.E. Hoffman A. Bove A.A. Isaac L. Hrabie J.A. Keefer L.K. J. Med. Chem. 1991; 34: 3242-3247Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Complete degradation of DEA/NO was assumed to release two molecules of NO after 10 min. For CO binding, the sGC sample was purged with CO gas for 15–20 min before the spectrum was recorded. Heme Soret Extinction Coefficient—Molar extinction coefficients were measured using the pyridine hemochromogen assay as described previously (42Maes E.M. Roberts S.A. Weichsel A. Montfort W.R. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12690-12699Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The protein solution (700 μl) was mixed with 100% pyridine (300 μl), 5 n KOH (20 μl), and crystals of dithionite. The peak absorbance at 556 nm minus that at 700 nm was used to determine the hemin concentration, assuming an extinction coefficient of 32 mm-1 cm-1. NO and CO complex Soret band and all Q-band extinction coefficients were estimated by their ratio to the unliganded Soret band. CO Dissociation Constants—The msGC-NT samples were placed in a septum-capped cuvette with minimal head space at room temperature (22 °C). Aliquots from CO-saturated protein buffer (50 mm KPO4, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, and 5% glycerol), assumed to be 1 mm in CO, were added to the cuvette and stirred for 10 min, and the spectrum was measured. When present, nucleotide (0.5–1 mm) or YC-1 compound (50 μm) was added before addition of CO. CO binding was measured by the shift in Soret band after accounting for dilution because of the addition of CO. This shift was estimated as A424–A437 times the dilution factor, except in the presence of YC-1, where A422 was used rather than A424. Data were fitted to a single-site saturation ligand binding model using SigmaPlot (SPSS, Inc., Chicago). For the wild-type protein in the presence of YC-1, titration was also undertaken in a cuvette with a 10-cm path length, using an RSM-1000 spectrophotometer (Olis, Inc., Bogart, GA), which yielded a value indistinguishable from that measured with the 1-cm cuvette. Kinetics for Proximal Histidine Release—The rates for release of β1 His-105 upon NO binding to msGC-NT were measured at 10 °C by mixing msGC-NT and NO in an RSM-1000 stopped-flow spectrophotometer (OLIS, Inc.). Samples of msGC-NT (0.7–2 μm) were prepared by first deoxygenating protein buffer through bubbling of argon gas for 10 min, followed by addition of protein and additional deoxygenation with an argon stream placed above the solution for ∼30 min. The protein solution was then transferred to the instrument in a gas-tight syringe. NO solutions were prepared by addition of DEA/NO from a stock solution to argon-purged protein buffer in a gas-tight syringe and then connected to the stopped-flow device. Decomposition was allowed to proceed for 20 min at room temperature before transfer to the instrument, where the solution was allowed to equilibrate to the desired temperature (5 min). Absorbance changes (A420) were fitted to single or double exponential equations using SigmaPlot; values reported are the average and standard deviation of 5–7 consecutive measurements. For experiments with nucleotides or YC-1, the compounds were pre-mixed with the protein sample. Kinetics of NO Release—Rates for denitrosylation of msGC-NT-NO were estimated using a dithionite/CO trap, as described (7Cary S.P. Winger J.A. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13064-13069Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 43Kharitonov V.G. Sharma V.S. Magde D. Koesling D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6814-6818Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). A slight excess of NO (from DEA/NO) was added to an anaerobic msGC-NT sample prepared as described above, and a spectrum was measured to ensure saturation. Nucleotide or YC-1 was pre-mixed with the protein sample before NO addition. The trapping solution was prepared by bubbling CO gas (10 min) into a freshly prepared dithionite solution (Na2S2O4, 60 mm in protein buffer). Denitrosylation was initiated by mixing the trapping and protein solutions either in a stopped-flow device at 20 °C, or in a cuvette at room temperature (22 °C), and monitoring the change in absorbance (A424–A413 or A424–A412). Rate constants were obtained by fitting the relevant time interval to a single or double exponential equation, as appropriate. For the cuvette data, the first 100 s were discarded to remove the fast phase, which was better estimated in the stopped-flow experiment. Kinetics of CO Binding and Release—CO binding rates were measured for a series of CO concentrations (0.05–0.5 mm) in a stopped-flow spectrophotometer by monitoring absorbance change (A424–A412) and fitting kobs versus [CO], which displayed the expected linear dependence for a monophasic process. Protein- and CO-containing solutions were prepared as described above. The second-order rate constants reported are for the slope and error from the linear fit. CO release rates from msGC-NT-CO were measured by replacing released CO with excess NO upon rapid mixing in the stopped-flow device. One syringe contained msGC-NT-CO, and the second contained protein buffer saturated with NO from DEA/NO (∼2 mm). All reactions were performed at 20 °C, and YC-1, where included, was pre-mixed with the protein sample. Guanylyl Cyclase Enzymatic Assay—The cGMP producing activity of msGC in cell lysates and metal-affinity column elution fractions was measured using an enzyme immunoassay kit (Cayman Chemical Co.), following the manufacturer's instructions. In a typical assay, 10 μl of reaction buffer (0.5 m HEPES, pH 7.5, 30 mm GTP, 60 mm MgCl2, 20 mm dithiothreitol) was added to protein sample for a total reaction volume of 100 μl. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 min and then quenched with 200 μl of 250 mm zinc acetate and 200 μl of 250 mm sodium carbonate. For experiments measuring NO-activated enzyme activity, protein samples were pre-mixed with DEA/NO before initiating catalysis by addition of reaction buffer. Molecular Modeling of N-terminal msGC—Sequences of the α1 and β1 subunits of msGC were submitted to the Robetta structure prediction server for domain analysis using Ginzu (44Kim D.E. Chivian D. Malmstrom L. Baker D. Proteins. 2005; 61: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Three domains were predicted for each subunit as follows: an N-terminal domain predicted to be an H-NOX domain (20Ma X. Sayed N. Beuve A. van den Akker F.

A 25-residue sequence between the second and third domains in each subunit was identified as a possible coiled-coil region. The 50 N-terminal residues of the α1 subunit, which have no counterpart in the β1 subunit, were predicted to be disordered. Ginzu did not predict the PAS domains. After domain analysis, the sequence of the α1 N-terminal domain (minus the 50 N-terminal residues predicted to be disordered) was submitted to the 3D-Jury Meta Server for structure prediction and initial model building (45Ginalski K. Elofsson A. Fischer D. Rychlewski L. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2003; 19: 1015-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). A template structure file was not specified. C-α models and alignments of α1 H-NOX with known H-NOX structures (Protein Data Bank entries 1XBN (21Nioche P. Berka V. Vipond J. Minton N. Tsai A.L. Raman C.S. Science. 2004; 306: 1550-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and 2O09 (20Ma X. Sayed N. Beuve A. van den Akker F. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 578-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar)) were returned from several severs. All had very significant 3D-Jury scores (100–108). Full-atom models were built from these alignments using Modeler (46Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar). The resulting models were nearly identical, varying only in the placement of a short insertion near the vacant heme cavity. The final model was minimized using NAMD (47Phillips J.C. Braun R. Wang W. Gumbart J. Tajkhorshid E. Villa E. Chipot C. Skeel R.D. Kale L. Schulten K. J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26: 1781-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (13350) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of Heterodimeric N-terminal Fragments of Manduca sGC—Studies on NO signaling have been limited by difficulties in obtaining sufficient quantities of intact sGC. To overcome this shortcoming, we pursued functional domains of sGC from M. sexta. Sequence analyses and homology modeling (described below) suggested boundaries for the C-terminal cyclase domains and N-terminal H-NOX domains of both subunits. Two constructs were prepared, msGC-NT1 (α1–471/β1–400), which lacks the cyclase domains and is expressed from a single plasmid, and msGC-NT2 (α49–471/β1–400), which is identical to msGC-NT1 except that it also lacks the putatively disordered N-terminal region of the α1 subunit (Fig. 1A). Both constructs produced soluble heterodimeric protein in an E. coli expression system, and both displayed identical functional behaviors, suggesting the α1 subunit N-terminal His tag did not affect activity; however, msGC-NT2 was the more stable of the two. Co-expression of both subunits and addition of heme precursor δ-aminolevulinate was required to produce soluble recombinant protein; expression of individual subunits or expression without δ-aminolevulinate led only to insoluble inclusion bodies. Purification using the α1 subunit N-terminal His tag was complicated by a tendency of the protein to lose heme. This tendency was exacerbated by the imidazole in the elution buffer, because imidazole can coordinate to heme and facilitate its removal. Heme loss has long been known to occur in sGC during isolation. To circumvent this difficulty, we developed a purification procedure where sGC was released from the nickel-affinity column by the addition of EDTA, which chelates the nickel and releases the protein from the column. Rapid purification over nickel-affinity and gel filtration columns yielded ∼1 mg of >90% pure protein/liter of cell culture (Fig. 2A). The protein behaved as a heterodimer by size-exclusion chromatography and typically displayed an A433/A280 ratio of 1.2. Best stability for the protein was achieved under anaerobic conditions and bound to CO, where little change was observed over several days. Soret band degradation is seen with time in the presence of the reductant dithiothreitol but not in the presence of tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. Truncated Manduca sGC Displays Typical Electronic Spectra— Truncated Manduca sGC heterodimers display Soret and Q-band absorption maxima that are typical for sGC proteins (Fig. 2B). The isolated protein has a broad Soret maximum centered at 433 nm, consistent with a high spin ferrous heme center. Binding of CO, which requires ferrous heme, shifts the Soret maximum to 425 nm and sharpens both the Soret and Q-bands, consistent with a low spin six-coordinate heme. The high purity of the protein allowed us to determine molar extinction coefficients for these bands, using the pyridine hemochromogen assay (Table 1). The resulting values were in good agreement with those reported for globins, nitrophorins, and full-length and β1 truncated mammalian sGC proteins (42Maes E.M. Roberts S.A. Weichsel A. Montfort W.R. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12690-12699Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 48Karow D.S. Pan D. Davis J.H. Behrends S. Mathies R.A.

S-layer glycan biosynthesis is encoded by a polycistronic slg (surface layer glycosylation) gene cluster. Four assigned glycosyltransferases named WsaC-WsaF, were investigated by a combined biochemical and NMR approach, starting from synthetic octyl-linked saccharide precursors. We demonstrate that three of the enzymes are rhamnosyltransferases that are responsible for the transfer of L-rhamnose from a dTDP-beta-L-Rha precursor to the nascent S-layer glycan, catalyzing the formation of the alpha1,3- (WsaC and WsaD) and beta1,2-linkages (WsaF) present in the adaptor saccharide and in the repeating units of the mature S-layer glycan, respectively. These enzymes work in concert with a multifunctional methylrhamnosyltransferase (WsaE). The N-terminal portion of WsaE is responsible for the S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methylation reaction of the terminal alpha1,3-linked L-rhamnose residue, and the central and C-terminal portions are involved in the transfer of L-rhamnose from dTDP-beta-L-rhamnose to the adaptor saccharide to form the alpha1,2- and alpha1,3-linkages during S-layer glycan chain elongation, with the methylation and the glycosylation reactions occurring independently. Characterization of these enzymes thus reveals the complete molecular basis for S-layer glycan biosynthesis."

Notably, genetic ablation of Capn4 results in early embryonic lethality, which demonstrates an essential role of the calpain small subunit during development (5Arthur J.S. Elce J.S. Hegadorn C.

Taken together, these findings suggest that the calpain small subunit could play a critical but yet unknown role in osteoblast biology in vivo. To test this hypothesis, we have conditionally ablated Capn4 in cells of the osteoblast lineage in vivo by using the Cre-LoxP system. Lack of the calpain small subunit in osteoblasts caused a significant decrease of both trabecular and cortical bone, which was associated with a severe impairment of osteoblast proliferation and differentiation. These findings are the first in vivo evidence that the calpain small subunit plays a crucial role in osteoblast function and bone homeostasis. Generation of Osx-Cre+/- Capn4flox/flox Mice—Mice homozygous for floxed Capn4 alleles (Capn4flox/flox) were crossed with those expressing Cre under the control of osterix promoter (Osx-Cre+/-) to generate Osx-Cre+/-Capn4flox/+ mice (15Tan Y.

These mice were then crossed with either Capn4flox/flox or Capn4flox/+ mice to generate Osx-Cre+/-Capn4flox/flox mutant mice. All experiments were performed in compliance with the guiding principles of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the subcommittee on Research Animal Care of the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). Genotype Analysis—Genomic DNA was isolated from tail biopsies as described previously (18Shimada M. Shimano H. Gotoda T. Yamamoto K. Kawamura M. Inaba T. Yazaki Y. Yamada N. J. Biol.

The Cre transgene was detected by PCR using the primers P1 (5′-CGCGGTCTGGCAGTAAAAACTATC-3′) and P2 (5′-CCCACCGTCAGTACGTGAGAT ATC-3′) to generate an internal sequence of Cre. Taking an advantage of a floxed construct, in which an intron 9 was shortened by 1.6 kilobase pairs (kbp), the Capn4 floxed and wild-type alleles were determined using two sets of PCR reactions (15Tan Y.

The floxed and wild-type alleles were determined as 0-bp (no amplified product) and 1.0-kbp PCR products, respectively, using primers P3 (5′-GTCAGGCTAGATGCCATGTTCC-3′) in exon 9 and P4 (5′-CGACTATCCGAGCGCTGCC-3′) within a sequence deleted in floxed allele in intron 9 and as 0.4-kbp and 2.0-kbp PCR products, respectively, using primers P3 (5′-GTCAGGCTAGATGCCATGTTCC-3′) and P5 (5′-GTTCACTTGGATCTGTCCGGTGCC-3′) corresponding to sequences in exons E9 and E10. Serology—Ionized calcium was measured with the Ciba-Corning 634 Ca2+/pH analyzer (Ciba-Corning Diagnostics Corp., Medfield, MA). Serum levels of osteocalcin (Biomedical Technologies Inc., Stoughton, MA) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP) 5b (Immunodiagnostic Systems, Tyne and Wear, UK) were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays as described by the manufacturers' instructions. Whole Mount Skeletal Staining—The whole mount skeletal staining was performed as described previously (20McLeod M.J. Teratology. 1980; 22: 299-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Briefly, newborn mice were fixed in ethanol for 5 days and then in acetone for 2 days. Staining with Alizarin red S and Alcian blue was performed for 3 days at 37 °C. After washing with distilled water, the skeleton was cleared in 1% KOH and taken through graded steps into 100% glycerol. Sample Preparation and Histological Analysis—For histological analysis, Osx-Cre+/-Capn4flox/flox and sex-matched control littermates (Osx-Cre+/-Capn4flox/+ and Capn4flox/flox) were sacrificed at birth and at 2, 4, 9, and 12 weeks of age. Tissues from Osx-Cre+/-Capn4flox/flox, and control littermates were fixed and stored as described previously (21Calvi L.M. Sims N.A. Hunzelman J.L. Knight M.C. Giovannetti A. Saxton J.M. Kronenberg H.M. Baron R. Schipani E. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In selected cases, hind limbs were decalcified, and paraffin blocks were prepared by standard histological procedures. To detect osteoclast-like cells, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining was performed using an acid phosphatase detection kit (Sigma-Aldrich) for some selected samples. In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridization analysis was performed as described previously (22Lee K. Lanske B. Karaplis A.C. Deeds J.D. Kohno H. Nissenson R.A. Kronenberg H.M. Segre G.V.

Complementary 35S-labeled riboprobes were transcribed from the plasmids encoding mouse type I collagen (Col.1), mouse matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)13, mouse osteocalcin (OC), mouse osteopontin (OP), and rat TRAP using Riboprobe systems from Promega (Madison, WI). Histomorphometry—For dynamic histomorphometry, animals were injected intraperitoneally with fluorochromes, calcein, and demeclocycline (20 μg/g of body weight, Sigma-Aldrich), 3 and 10 days before sacrifice, respectively. Bones were fixed and embedded in methyl methacrylate resin as described previously (21Calvi L.M. Sims N.A. Hunzelman J.L. Knight M.C. Giovannetti A. Saxton J.M. Kronenberg H.M. Baron R. Schipani E.

Five-micrometer sections were stained with Masson Trichrome or coverslipped unstained, and histomorphometric analysis was performed with the Osteomeasure system (Osteometrics Inc., Atlanta, GA) using standard procedures. Tibial sections were measured in the proximal metaphysis beginning 340 μm below the chondro-osseous junction. Microcomputed Tomography (μCT)—High resolution images of the femur and lumber vertebra were acquired by using a desktop microtomographic imaging system (MicroCT40: Scanco Medical, Basserdorf, Switzerland) as described previously (23Bouxsein M.L.

We assessed trabecular bone morphology in the distal femoral metaphysis and the fifth lumbar vertebral body and cortical bone morphology at the femoral mid-shaft (voxel size = 12 μm). For trabecular bone, we measured bone volume fraction (BV/TV, %), trabecular number (Tb.N, 1/mm), and trabecular separation (Tb.Sp, μm) (see Fig. 3). For cortical bone, we assess the total cross-sectional area (TA, mm2), cortical bone area (BA, mm2), cortical thickness (μm), and the polar moment of inertia (MOIpolar, mm4) (see Fig. 3). Analysis of Bromodeoxyuridine Incorporation—Two-week-old mice were injected intraperitoneally with 100 μg of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) and 12 μg of fluorodeoxyuridine per g of body weight 2 h before sacrifice (Sigma-Aldrich). After sacrifice, hind limbs were dissected, fixed, decalcified, and embedded in paraffin, and longitudinal sections across the tibia and femur were obtained. To identify actively proliferating cells, nuclei that had incorporated BrdUrd were detected using a Zymed BrdUrd immunostaining kit (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). For each section, high power field images of the primary spongiosa and the proliferating chondrocyte layer were photographed. All BrdUrd-positive (black) and BrdUrd-negative (light blue) nuclei in these zones were counted separately. Four or five nonconsecutive sections were counted for each of two or three Capn4flox/flox, Osx-Cre+/- Capn4flox/+, and Osx-Cre+/-Capn4flox/flox littermate specimens at each time point. Determination of Apoptotic Osteoblasts in Vivo—Apoptotic osteoblasts were detected in sections of decalcified tibias of 2-week-old Capn4flox/flox, Osx-Cre+/-Capn4flox/+ mice, and Osx-Cre+/-Capn4flox/flox littermates by a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick-end labeling reaction using reagents from the in situ cell death detection kit, POD (Roche Diagnostics). The sections were counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Osteoblast Isolation and Culture—Osteoblasts were isolated from calvariae of newborn mice by serial digestion in α-minimum essential medium (αMEM) (Invitrogen) containing 0.25 mg/ml type I and 0.75 mg/ml type II collagenases (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ). Calvariae were digested for 15 min at 37 °C with constant agitation. The digestion solution was collected, washed with fresh medium, and digested five additional times. Digestions 3–6 were collected, washed with αMEM, and cultured in αMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen Corp.) for 48 h. Medium was changed every other day. Adenovirus Infection—Monolayer Capn4flox/flox osteoblasts were infected with either control (adeno-lacZ) or Cre-recombinase adenovirus (adeno-Cre) at a multiplicity of infection of 100 for most experiments (26Pfander D. Kobayashi T. Knight M.C. Zelzer E. Chan D.A. Olsen B.R. Giaccia A.J. Johnson R.S. Haase V.H. Schipani E. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 2497-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Osteoblasts were harvested after 48 h. Genomic DNA and total RNA were extracted from osteoblasts for determination of efficiency of Cre-recombinase. Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) Activity—ALP activity was measured in cell layers using a p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate (Sigma-Aldrich) as described previously (27Gori F. Divieti P. Demay M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46515-46522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in αMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin for 7, 14, and 21 days, respectively. Bone Nodule Assay—Cells were cultured in αMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin supplemented with 50 μg/ml l-ascorbic acid and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate (Sigma-Aldrich) (differentiation medium) for 21 and 28 days, respectively. Cells were then fixed with 70% ethanol, and mineralized calcium-phosphate deposits were stained with either Alizarin red S or von Kossa. Bone nodules were counted using a dissecting microscope. In some experiments, Alizarin red S dye was eluted and quantified as described elsewhere (27Gori F. Divieti P. Demay M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46515-46522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Real-time Quantitative PCR (qPCR)—The efficiency of Cre-recombinase driven by the osterix promoter or adeno-Cre was assessed using real-time qPCR on genomic DNA isolated from tibiae of Osx-Cre+/-Capn4flox/flox and Capn4flox/flox mice and from primary osteoblasts harvested from Capn4flox/flox mice infected with either adeno-lacZ or adeno-Cre. In brief, tibial diaphyses of Osx-Cre+/-Capn4flox/flox and Capn4flox/flox mice were isolated, extensively flushed in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated in αMEM containing collagenases I and II at 37 °C for 45 min to remove hematopoietic cells and soft tissues. The diaphyses were then crushed and further digested with collagenase in αMEM medium. Genomic DNA was isolated using standard protocols. Real-time qPCR was then performed at 60 °C for 40 cycles in the Opticon continuous fluorescence detector by using a SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen) and primers P3 and P5. To determine RNA expression of various genes, total RNA was extracted from cells by using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). First-strand cDNA was synthesized using the First Strand cDNA synthesis kit for reverse transcription-PCR (Roche Diagnostics) followed by real-time qPCR. Samples were run in duplicate, and the results were normalized to GAPDH expression (26Pfander D. Kobayashi T. Knight M.C. Zelzer E. Chan D.A. Olsen B.R. Giaccia A.J. Johnson R.S. Haase V.H.

Osteoblast Apoptosis Assay in Vitro—Forty-eight h after adenoviral infection, osteoblasts were replated in 24-well plates at a density of 2.5 × 104 cells/cm2. Cells were stained with annexin V-PE and 7-aminoactinomycin D using Guava PCA Nexin kit and analyzed by Guava personal cytometer (Guava Technology Inc., Hayward, CA). Gene Silencing by siRNA—UMR106-01 (UMR) rat osteosarcoma cells were plated at a density of 5 × 104 cells/cm2 in 24-well plates. Capn4 and control nonfunctional siRNA were transfected into UMR cells using Oligofectamine as recommended by the manufacture (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Commercially available Capn4 siRNA sequences are as follows: siRNA/Capn4-1, P26/P27 (5′-ACUGACCGACAGACCAUUGGUA-3′ and 5′-UACCAAUGGUCGAUCGGUCAGU-3′); siRNA/Capn4-2, P28/P29 (5′-GGAUCCGACUCUGCUGCAAACAUGU-3′ and 5′-ACAUGUUUGCAGCAGAGUCGGUC-3′) (Invitrogen). Efficiency of Capn4 siRNA was assessed by calpain activity as described previously (2Shimada M. Mahon M.J. Greer P.A. Segre G.V. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 2336-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Statistics—Data were calculated from 3 to 5 independent experiments and expressed as the mean ± S.E. of either duplicate or triplicate determinations. Statistical analysis was performed using the analysis of variance or the unpaired Student's t test. Statistical significance was determined using Fisher's projected least significant difference, and p values less than 0.05 were accepted as significant. Generation of Mice Lacking Capn4 in Cells of the Osteoblast Lineage and Characterization of Their Gross Phenotype—Mice expressing Cre under the control of the osterix promoter (Osx-Cre+/-) were crossed with floxed Capn4 mice (Capn4flox/flox) to produce Osx-Cre+/-Capn4flox/+ mice, which were then mated with either Capn4flox/flox or Capn4flox/+ to generate osteoblast-specific Capn4 knock-out mice, Osx-Cre+/-Capn4flox/flox. Osx-Cre+/-Capn4flox/+, Osx-Cre+/-Capn4+/+ and Capn4flox/flox were also used in the study as control littermates. Efficiency of Cre activity assessed by real-time qPCR of either genomic DNA or RNA isolated from 4-week-old mutant tibiae was ∼85% (genomic DNA, 86.5 ± 2.5%; RNA, 88.7 ± 0.8%). Osx-Cre+/-Capn4flox/flox (mutant) mice were born at the expected Mendelian frequency and were viable into adulthood and fertile. Their mean body weight in both sexes was reduced starting from 4–5 weeks of age in comparison with Osx-Cre+/-Capn4flox/+, Capn4flox/flox, and Osx-Cre+/-Capn4+/+ control littermates. Surprisingly, at 10 weeks of age, body weight of Osx-Cre+/-Capn4flox/+ male mice was also significantly lower than that of the other controls, Capn4flox/flox and Osx-Cre+/-Capn4+/+ (Fig. 1C). Ionized calcium levels of 8-week-old mice were similar between mutant and control littermates. The newborn skeleton of Osx-Cre+/-Capn4flox/flox mice was definitively smaller than that of Capn4flox/flox and Osx-Cre+/- Capn4flox/+ littermates but did not exhibit any obvious patterning defect (Fig. 1A). Notably, mineralization of the skull was strikingly impaired in Osx-Cre+/-Capn4flox/flox mice (Fig. 1B). Osx-Cre+/-Capn4flox/flox Mice Have Decreased Trabecular Bone and Reduced Expression of Osteoblast-specific Markers— Detailed histological and in situ hybridization analyses were then performed on hind limbs isolated from 2-, 4-, and 9-week-old male mice, respectively, to investigate a putative role of Capn4 in bone modeling and remodeling. Tibiae of 2-week-old Osx-Cre+/- Capn4flox/flox mice had markedly reduced trabecular bone when compared with both Osx-Cre+/-Capn4flox/+ and Capn4flox/flox control littermates (Fig. 2A). Moreover, expression of osteoblast markers such as MMP13, Col.1, and OC was severely impaired in mutant bones (Fig. 2A and data not shown). A similar phenotype was also detectable in 4- and 9-week-old mutant mice of either sex (Fig. 2, B and C, and data not shown). Surprisingly, at these ages, Osx-Cre+/- Capn4flox/flox/+ mice displayed a loss of trabecular bone, which was virtually indistinguishable from that of Osx-Cre+/- Capn4flox/flox mutants, as shown by routine histology and detection of Col.1 mRNA by in situ hybridization analysis (Fig. 2, B and C). Conversely, Osx-Cre+/-Capn4+/+ mice did not present any detectable bone abnormality at any prenatal or postnatal age. μCT analysis showed no significant differences in 12-week-old male and female Osx-Cre+/-Capn4+/+ versus Capn4flox/flox when compared with parameters such as bone volume per total volume (16.4 ± 2.0 versus 15.3 ± 4.0%), trabecular number (5.1 ± 0.2 versus 4.6 ± 0.8/mm), and trabecular spacing (187.3 ± 10.2 versus 216.85 ± 44.5 μm) (data for female not shown). These results, thus, exclude any adverse effect of the Cre transgene per se on bone homeostasis. It is, therefore, likely that lack of a single Capn4 allele in cells of the osteoblast lineage is sufficient to cause bone loss, which, however, is detectable exclusively in adult mice. Histomorphometric and μCT analyses were performed on bone specimens of Capn4flox/flox and Osx-Cre+/-Capn4flox/flox mice and confirmed a significant decrease of bone volume and trabecular number with concomitant increase of trabecular spacing in Osx-Cre+/-Capn4flox/flox when compared with Capn4flox/flox control male mice at 12 weeks of age (Fig. 3A and data not shown). Moreover, bone formation rate, osteoblast number, and mineral apposition rate were all significantly reduced in Osx-Cre+/- Capn4flox/flox (Fig. 3A). Osteoclast number was also significantly decreased in mutants versus controls as indicated by both histomorphometry and TRAP staining (Fig. 3A and data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that bone loss observed in Osx-Cre+/- Capn4flox/flox mice is likely the consequence of decreased osteoblast number and activity. Consistent with the findings described above, serum levels of both osteocalcin and TRACP 5b, markers of osteoblast and osteoclast activities, respectively, were markedly reduced in mutant mice (osteocalcin; Capn4flox/flox (n = 7), 60.0 ± 5.3 ng/ml; Osx-Cre+/-Capn4flox/flox (n = 9), 39.7 ± 2.6* ng/ml. TRACP5b; Capn4flox/flox (n = 6), 3.9 ± 0.6 units/liter; Osx-Cre+/– Capn4flox/flox (n = 10), 2.7 ± 0.3* units/liter. *, p < 0.05). Lack of Capn4 in Cells of the Osteoblast Lineage Reduces Bone Cortical Thickness and Bone Architecture—Cortical bone morphology was examined by μCT analysis at the mid-femoral diaphysis. Total and cortical bone areas and cortical thickness were significantly reduced in Osx-Cre+/-Capn4flox/flox mice versus controls, suggesting that the bone is smaller and that periosteal apposition is inhibited in Osx-Cre+/-Capn4flox/flox mice (Fig. 3B). In addition, the polar moment of inertia, an index of torsional strength, was significantly lower in mutants than controls (Fig. 3B). Thus, deletion of Capn4 in cells of the osteoblast lineage causes bone loss in both trabecular and cortical compartments and severely affects parameters that predict bone strength. Lack of Capn4 Impairs Proliferation of Cells of the Osteoblast Lineage—The reduced osteoblast number observed in Osx-Cre+/-Capn4flox/flox mice could be a consequence of either decreased proliferation or increased apoptosis. To distinguish between these two possibilities, proliferation of cells of the osteoblast lineage was examined by BrdUrd incorporation in 1- and 2-week-old mice. The number of BrdUrd-positive cells detected in the primary spongiosa was significantly reduced in Osx-Cre+/-Capn4flox/flox when compared with Osx-Cre+/- Capn4flox/+ and Capn4flox/flox littermates (Fig. 4B, panel 1), whereas chondrocyte proliferation, which served as an internal control for proper BrdUrd uptake and distribution, was not affected (Fig. 4B, panel 2). No significant difference in the number of apoptotic cells determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick-end labeling staining was detected in 2-week-old mutant bones versus controls (data not shown). Collectively, these data indicate that the reduced osteoblast number observed in Osx-Cre+/-Capn4flox/flox is likely due to reduced proliferation of cells of the osteoblast lineage. Lack of Capn4 Impairs Osteoblast Differentiation and Mineralization in Vitro—Osteoblast functions were next investigated in vitro. For this purpose, primary calvarial osteoblasts were harvested from Osx-Cre+/-Capn4flox/+ and Osx-Cre+/- Capn4flox/flox newborn mice and seeded at a density of 5.0 × 103 cells/cm2. Levels of Capn4 mRNA expression were reduced by ∼90% in Osx-Cre+/-Capn4flox/flox osteoblasts in comparison with Osx-Cre+/-Capn4flox/+. Cell growth was indistinguishable between Osx-Cre+/-Capn4flox/flox and Osx-Cre+/- Capn4flox/+ calvarial cells until day 10 and became significantly lower in Osx-Cre+/-Capn4flox/flox cells than Osx-Cre+/-Capn4flox/+ cells on day 14. Osteoblast differentiation and mineralization, assessed by ALP activity and mRNA expression of various osteoblast markers, and number of bone nodules, normalized by cell number at the time of assay, respectively, were all significantly lower in Osx-Cre+/-Capn4flox/flox than in Osx-Cre+/-Capn4flox/+ calva"
https://openalex.org/W2033585878,"Cathepsin B is a papain-like cysteine protease showing both endo- and exopeptidase activity, the latter due to a unique occluding loop that restricts access to the active site cleft. To clarify the mode by which natural protein inhibitors manage to overcome this obstacle, we have analyzed the structure and function of cathepsin B in complexes with the Trypanosoma cruzi inhibitor, chagasin. Kinetic analysis revealed that substitution of His-110e, which anchors the loop in occluding position, results in 3-fold increased chagasin affinity (Ki for H110A cathepsin B, 0.35 nm) due to an improved association rate (kon, 5 × 105 m-1s-1). The structure of chagasin in complex with cathepsin B was solved in two crystal forms (1.8 and 2.67Å resolution), demonstrating that the occluding loop is displaced to allow chagasin binding with its three loops, L4, L2, and L6, spanning the entire active site cleft. The occluding loop is differently displaced in the two structures, indicating a large range of movement and adoption of conformations forced by the inhibitor. The area of contact is slightly larger than in chagasin complexes with the endopeptidase, cathepsin L. However, residues important for high affinity to both enzymes are mainly found in the outer loops L4 and L6 of chagasin. The chagasin-cathepsin B complex provides a structural framework for modeling and design of inhibitors for cruzipain, the parasite cysteine protease and a virulence factor in Chagas disease.

Cysteine proteases that belong to the papain family (MEROPS family C1) (1Rawlings N.D. Morton F.R. Kok C.Y. Kong J. Barrett A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) are essential for the normal body functions and are also implicated in many disease processes, making them candidate therapeutic targets (1Rawlings N.D. Morton F.R. Kok C.Y. Kong J. Barrett A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 2Yasuda Y. Kaleta J. Brömme D. Adv.

In addition to their action as endopeptidases, several family C1 enzymes also act as exopeptidases. This specialization is achieved in several ways by incorporation of additional structural elements that restrict access to specific regions of their active site cleft. For instance, aminopeptidases retain fragments of the propeptide that block part of the unprimed side of the active site (S4, S3, S2, and S1), whereas access to the primed sites (S1′, S2′, and S3′) in carboxypeptidases is controlled by an extra sequence that is inserted into the main chain of the mature enzyme and loops back into the active site cleft. In the case of the aminopeptidase cathepsin H, an eight-residue portion of the propeptide, the mini-chain, is held in the unprimed side of the active site (4Guncar G. Podobnik M. Pungercar J. Strukelj B. Turk V. Turk D. Structure. 1998; 6: 51-61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In cathepsin C, a large segment of the proregion, termed the exclusion domain, remains associated with the mature peptidase and blocks the active site cleft beyond the S2 site, rendering cathepsin C an aminodipeptidase (5Molgaard A. Arnau J. Lauritzen C. Larsen S. Petersen G. Pedersen J. Biochem. J. 2007; 401: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In both enzymes, the additional elements provide a strategically positioned negative charge to accept the substrate N terminus. In cathepsins X and B, an occluding loop is present that blocks the primed side of the active site, restricting access to one (cathepsin X) (6Sivaraman J. Nägler D.K. Zhang R. Ménard R. Cygler M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 939-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) or two (cathepsin B) (7Musil D. Zucic D. Engh R.A. Mayr I. Huber R. Popovic T. Turk V. Towatari T. Katunuma N. Bode W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2321-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar) residues. In cathepsin B, a histidine residue (His-111e) 4The residues of the inhibitor are labeled without a chain designator. The residues of the enzyme are marked e, except for the residues belonging to the prosegment sequence, which are marked p. provides a positive charge to accept the C-terminal carboxylate of a substrate. At low pH, the occluding loop is held in place by a salt bridge between His-110e in the middle of the loop and Asp-22e in the main body of the protease (8Illy C. Quraishi O. Wang J. Purisima E. Vernet T. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1197-1202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The uniqueness of this arrangement has been exploited in the design of specific cathepsin B inhibitors, such as CA-074 (9Murata M. Miyashita S. Yokoo C. Tamai M. Hanada K. Hatayama K. Towatari T. Nikawa T. Katunuma N. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), which are based on the epoxysuccinyl reactive center first recognized in the Aspergillus japonicus product, E-64 (10Hanada K. Tamai M. Yamagishi M. Ohmura S. Sawada J. Tanaka I. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1978; 42: 523-528Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The occluding loop is not, however, fixed in one conformation. As the pH is raised, His-110e becomes deprotonated, and the loop is free to move, allowing cathepsin B to act as endopeptidase (11Nägler D.K. Storer A.C. Portaro F.C.V. Carmona E. Juliano L. Ménard R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12608-12615Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The ability of the occluding loop to adopt multiple conformations is apparent in the structure of the proenzyme. Here, the proregion passes through the active site cleft, its peptide chain adopting the opposite direction relative to that required for substrate cleavage (12Cygler M. Sivaraman J. Grochulski P. Coulombe R. Storer A.C. Mort J.S. Structure. 1996; 4: 405-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The occluding loop is deflected by the propeptide, as a part of it occupies the catalytic crevice together with the occluding loop. Naturally occurring inhibitors of cysteine proteases, such as the cystatins, bind to most of the papain family members with extremely high affinity (13Abrahamson M. Alvarez-Fernandez M. Nathanson C.M. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2003; 70: 179-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Much lower affinity is seen for cathepsin B due to obstruction of the binding site by the occluding loop (14Pavlova A. Krupa J.C. Mort J.S. Abrahamson M. Björk I. FEBS Lett. 2000; 487: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, inhibition of cathepsin B by natural protein inhibitors does occur; hence, the structure of such complexes can provide interesting information on the mechanism of occlusion. In this work we have determined two crystal structures of a complex between human cathepsin B and chagasin, a cysteine protease inhibitor from the protozoan pathogen Trypanosoma cruzi. The properties of chagasin are similar to those of cystatins, but its structure is very different (15Monteiro A.C.S. Abrahamson M. Lima A.P.C.A. Vannier-Santos M.A. Scharfstein J. J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) and its mode of binding to the cysteine endopeptidases, cathepsin L and falcipain, has been recently elucidated (16Ljunggren A.

The present structures of the cathepsin B inhibitor complex provide a detailed atomic view of how the parasite protein inhibits a cysteine exopeptidase that may be in the first line of the host defense. The high level of structural and functional similarity of cathepsins B and L with cruzipain also offers clues on how the cysteine protease activity of the parasite enzyme could be regulated. This may be of biomedical relevance since cruzipain is a potent virulence factor in T. cruzi infections and, hence, a possible therapeutic target in patients with Chagas disease.

The protein was expressed in a glutathione S-transferase fusion system (Amersham Biosciences) and purified by affinity and ion exchange chromatography as described earlier (16Ljunggren A. Redzynia I. Alvarez-Fernandez M. Abrahamson M. Mort J.S. Krupa J.C. Jaskolski M. Bujacz G. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 371: 137-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The chagasin-containing fractions eluted in the final purification step were pooled, dialyzed against 100 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.0, and concentrated to ∼5 mg/ml using a Vivaspin column with a cut-off limit of 5 kDa (Vivascience, Lincoln, UK). Human cathepsin B variants were produced by Pichia pastoris expression (Invitrogen). All recombinant variants were derived from a full-length pro-cathepsin B cDNA insert in which the codon for Ser-115e in an Asn-Xaa-Ser glycosylation consensus sequence had been changed by site-directed mutagenesis to an Ala-115e codon (21Mach L. Mort J.S. Glössl J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13030-13035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By further mutagenesis, the variant (H110A,S115A)-cathepsin B was produced, with removal of the His-110e side chain that is believed to be critical for the conformation of the occluding loop (22Krupa J.C. Hasnain S. Nägler D.K. Ménard R. Mort J.S. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The mutant protein was originally designed to facilitate purification of the enzyme to homogeneity to avoid different glycoforms of the recombinant protein when produced in yeast cells. The S115A substitution has no effect on the enzymatic properties of cathepsin B; recombinant S115A-mutated cathepsin B has highly similar activity as the wild type protein purified from liver (23Hasnain S. Hirama T. Tam A. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4713-4721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The S115A- and (H110A,S115A)-cathepsin B variants were expressed as inactive pro-proteins. Autocatalytic activation was accomplished by incubation of the purified proenzyme in 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 1 mm EDTA, for 5 days, after which the active enzyme was purified by CM-Sepharose FastFlow column chromatography (22Krupa J.C. Hasnain S. Nägler D.K. Ménard R. Mort J.S. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For crystallization, inactive protein with the catalytic Cys-29e residue mutated to Ala was generated. Maturation of the resulting (C29A,H110A,S115A)-cathepsin B was achieved as described previously (14Pavlova A. Krupa J.C. Mort J.S. Abrahamson M. Björk I. FEBS Lett. 2000; 487: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Highly purified (C29A,H110A,S115A)-cathepsin B was dialyzed against 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and concentrated to ∼3 mg/ml for crystallization trials. Active papain was prepared from the commercial papaya latex enzyme (Sigma-Aldrich) through affinity purification on Sepharose 4B-coupled Gly-Gly-Tyr-Arg column, as detailed previously (24Blumberg S. Schechter I. Berger A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 15: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 25Hall A. Håkansson K. Mason R.W. Grubb A. Abrahamson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5115-5121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Purified this way, the enzyme could be activated to at least 65% even after storage at −80 °C for up to 3 months. Enzyme Inhibition Assays—Active-site titration of papain for the determination of the molar enzyme inhibitory concentrations of chagasin preparations was accomplished as described (26Abrahamson M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 685-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), demonstrating that the recombinant chagasin used was properly folded and essentially fully active as a protease inhibitor (16Ljunggren A. Redzynia I. Alvarez-Fernandez M. Abrahamson M. Mort J.S. Krupa J.C. Jaskolski M. Bujacz G. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 371: 137-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The equilibrium dissociation constants (Ki) of chagasin complexes were determined for non-glycosylated S115A- and (H110A,S115A)-cathepsin B. The continuous-rate method used previously for studies of cystatin interactions with target proteases was followed (26Abrahamson M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 685-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The fluorogenic substrate used was 10 μm Z-Phe-Arg-NHMec 5The abbreviation used is: Z-Phe-Arg-NHMec, carbobenzoxy-phenylalanyl-arginine-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin. (Bachem Feinchemikalien, Bubendorf, Switzerland), and the assay buffer contained 133 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 1.3 mm EDTA, and 2.8 mm dithiothreitol. Steady-state velocities were measured, and apparent Ki values (Ki (app)) were calculated according to Henderson (27Henderson P.J. Biochem. J. 1972; 127: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) using [I] values from active-site titrations. Corrections for substrate competition were made using a Km value of 55 μm for cathepsin B hydrolysis of Z-Phe-Arg-NHMec. To calculate the association rate constants for chagasin interaction with S115A- and (H110A,S115A)-cathepsin B, the pseudo-first-order rate constants (kobs) in continuous-rate assays with different concentrations of chagasin were determined from the pre-steady-state phase of the velocity curve by non-linear regression using FLUSYS (obtained from Dr. Neil Rawlings, The Babraham Institute). The association rate constant (kon) was then calculated from the slope of a plot of the kobs values versus inhibitor concentration (Fig. 1). Protein Analyses—Protein concentration in preparations used for crystallization trials was estimated by A280 measurement using theoretical extinction coefficients calculated in PROTPARAM (28Gasteiger E. Hoogland C. Gattiker A. Duvaud S. Wilkins M.R. Appel R.D. Bairoch A. ProtParam. Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, NJ2005Google Scholar). N-terminal sequencing was carried out after electrophoresis in SDS-PAGE gels, blotting to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and staining with 0.05% Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Edman degradation was carried out by an Applied Biosystems Procise system (Sheldon Biotechnology Centre, McGill University). Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Reflex III, Bruker) analysis was used to verify the correct mass of recombinant chagasin and cathepsin B variants. Complex formation after mixing of purified chagasin and cathepsin B was studied using agarose gel electrophoresis (29Jeppsson J.O. Laurell C.B. Franzén B. Clin. Chem. 1979; 25: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The fate of chagasin in such complexes after prolonged incubation was studied by SDS-PAGE using 4-12% gradient gels (Novex; Invitrogen) and the buffer system recommended by the gel supplier. Crystallization—All crystals used in this study were grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 18 °C. Initial screening for crystallization conditions was done using Peg/Ion Screen and Crystal Screen (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA). Crystals of the chagasin-cathepsin B complex could be grown under three different conditions, and those used for diffraction experiments were obtained in the following crystallization trials. Crystal form I was obtained when the chagasin-cathepsin B complex was prepared by direct mixing in the drops of the following solutions: 1 μl of chagasin (5 mg/ml), 2 μl of cathepsin B (3 mg/ml), 2 μl of precipitant (0.2 m NH4H2PO4, 20% polyethylene glycol 3350, pH 4.6). After 2 weeks clusters of rod-shaped crystals appeared that were tightly associated and very hard to separate. To prevent crystal cracking and degradation due to drop evaporation, the separation was performed under oil. A single crystal with the dimensions of 0.15 × 0.05 × 0.02 mm was used for data collection. Mineral oil was also used for cryoprotection. Crystal form II was obtained when the chagasin-cathepsin B complex was prepared by mixing chagasin at 5 mg/ml concentration with cathepsin B solution at 3 mg/ml concentration in a 1:3 volume ratio. Drops were mixed from 1.5 μl of protein solution and 1 μl of precipitant solution containing 0.14 m NH4F and 14% polyethylene glycol 3350, pH 6.2. The crystals, in the form of thin square plates, reached maximum dimensions of 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.01 mm within 1 week. A mixture of the well solution with 50% polyethylene glycol 400 (v/v) in a 1:1 ratio was used as cryoprotectant. Data Collection and Processing—X-ray diffraction data were collected for crystal forms I and II. The measurements were performed using synchrotron radiation generated at the MAX-lab (Lund, Sweden) beamlines I-911-2 and I-911-5. Crystals of form I are monoclinic, space group C2, and diffract X-rays to 1.80 Å resolution. Crystals of form II are tetragonal, space group P42212, and diffract X-rays to 2.67 Å resolution. In both cases the diffraction data were indexed, integrated, and scaled with Denzo and Scalepack from the HKL program package (30Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38702) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—A partial solution of the structure of the chagasin-cathepsin B complex in crystal form I was obtained by molecular replacement using MolRep (31Vagin A.A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4196) Google Scholar). The structure of human liver cathepsin B (PDB code 1HUC) (7Musil D. Zucic D. Engh R.A. Mayr I. Huber R. Popovic T. Turk V. Towatari T. Katunuma N. Bode W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2321-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar) provided the initial search model. The complete model of the complex was obtained by superposition of the chagasin-cathepsin L model (PDB code 2NQD) (16Ljunggren A. Redzynia I. Alvarez-Fernandez M. Abrahamson M. Mort J.S. Krupa J.C. Jaskolski M. Bujacz G. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 371: 137-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) on the oriented cathepsin B portion as the target. The chagasin molecule derived from the cathepsin L complex fit the electron density map very well. The resulting model of the chagasin-cathepsin B complex was refined using a rigid body procedure, with the enzyme and the inhibitor chains treated as separate rigid blocks. The structure of the tetragonal crystal (form II) was solved by molecular replacement using MolRep and the form I model of the chagasin-cathepsin B complex. In both cases, structure refinement was carried out in Refmac5 (32Murshudov G.N. Vagin A. Dodson E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Model rebuilding was carried out in Coot (35Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23864) Google Scholar) with water molecules introduced manually. Progress of the refinement was monitored, and the models were validated using Rfree testing (36Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (3875) Google Scholar). The quality of the final structures was assessed with Procheck (37Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The final refinement statistics are shown in Table 1. The refined atomic coordinates and structure factors for the monoclinic and tetragonal structures have been deposited in the PDB under accession codes 3CBJ and 3CBK, respectively. Chagasin Is an Efficient Inhibitor of Cathepsin B—Chagasin is a small protein of 110 amino acid residues (Mr 12,440 for the recombinant protein used in the present study), showing tight, reversible binding and inhibition of human cathepsin L in 1:1 molar ratio in competition with substrates but without being cleaved by the protease (16Ljunggren A. Redzynia I. Alvarez-Fernandez M. Abrahamson M. Mort J.S. Krupa J.C. Jaskolski M. Bujacz G. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 371: 137-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It also inhibits other papain-like cysteine proteases, such as cruzipain from the T. cruzi parasite itself or cathepsin B from the human host (15Monteiro A.C.S. Abrahamson M. Lima A.P.C.A. Vannier-Santos M.A. Scharfstein J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3933-3942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ljunggren A. Redzynia I. Alvarez-Fernandez M. Abrahamson M. Mort J.S. Krupa J.C. Jaskolski M. Bujacz G. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 371: 137-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The function of chagasin as a cathepsin B inhibitor was analyzed in detail using two recombinant forms of the human enzyme. One was mature, non-glycosylated cathepsin B (S115A-cathepsin B), and the other contained an additional H110Ae substitution in the occluding loop (H110A,S115A-cathepsin B). The occluding loop is a unique structural feature of cathepsin B that partly covers the active site cleft and is responsible for the carboxydipeptidase activity of the enzyme under certain pH conditions (7Musil D. Zucic D. Engh R.A. Mayr I. Huber R. Popovic T. Turk V. Towatari T. Katunuma N. Bode W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2321-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Logically, the occluding loop could also affect binding of a protein inhibitor to the active site cleft of the enzyme. Dilute cathepsin B assays with the substrate Z-Phe-Arg-NHMec at pH 6.5 allowed the determination of the equilibrium between free and chagasin-bound enzyme at steady state when varying concentrations of chagasin were added. Compensated for substrate competition, the calculated Ki values for chagasin inhibition of wild type and H110Ae cathepsin B were 0.93 and 0.35 nm, respectively. Thus, removal of the His-110e side chain from the occluding loop results in noticeable improvement of inhibitor binding. However, the affinity for the mutated cathepsin B is still lower than that measured for chagasin binding to cysteine endopeptidases, papain, cruzipain, and cathepsin L (15Monteiro A.C.S. Abrahamson M. Lima A.P.C.A. Vannier-Santos M.A. Scharfstein J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3933-3942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ljunggren A. Redzynia I. Alvarez-Fernandez M. Abrahamson M. Mort J.S. Krupa J.C. Jaskolski M. Bujacz G. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 371: 137-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The rate constants for association (kon) of chagasin with the two cathepsin B forms were determined under pseudo-first-order conditions from the rates of inactivation of the enzyme (Fig. 1). The calculated kon value for wild type human cathepsin B was 8 × 104 m-1s-1. The association rate for H110Ae cathepsin B was clearly faster with a kon value 5 × 105 m-1s-1, estimated from a linear relation between the rate and inhibitor concentration in the assay (Fig. 1), approaching the fast association rate observed for cathepsin L (2.5 × 106 m-1s-1) (16Ljunggren A. Redzynia I. Alvarez-Fernandez M. Abrahamson M. Mort J.S. Krupa J.C. Jaskolski M. Bujacz G. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 371: 137-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Structural Determinants of the Chagasin-Cathepsin B Interaction—The crystal structure of the chagasin complex with cathepsin B was determined for an inactive recombinant enzyme variant. Its primary structure corresponds to the native human cathepsin B sequence with the occluding loop substitutions H110Ae and S115Ae and with an additional C29Ae mutation of the catalytic cysteine residue introduced to prevent potential autocatalytic degradation under the extended incubation time required for crystallization. The chagasin-cathepsin B complex was crystallized in two forms, monoclinic (I) and tetragonal (II). Form I crystals were obtained from complex made by placing drops of the two proteins on the coverslip and allowing them to mix, whereas form II crystals were obtained from a complex prepared by preincubating both proteins before crystallization trials. Because the crystal structure of form I (Fig. 2) was determined to a significantly higher resolution, it will be used in the discussion unless stated otherwise.

The absence of dystrophin in models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) has been connected to altered ion channel properties e.g. impaired L-type Ca2+ currents. In regenerating mdx muscle, 'revertant' fibres restore dystrophin expression. Their functionality involving DHPR-Ca2+-channels is elusive.We developed a novel 'in-situ' confocal immuno-fluorescence and imaging technique that allows, for the first time, quantitative subcellular dystrophin-DHPR colocalization in individual, non-fixed, muscle fibres. Tubular DHPR signals alternated with second harmonic generation signals originating from myosin. Dystrophin-DHPR colocalization was substantial in wt fibres, but diminished in most mdx fibres. Mini-dystrophin (MinD) expressing fibres successfully restored colocalization. Interestingly, in some aged mdx fibres, colocalization was similar to wt fibres. Most mdx fibres showed very weak membrane dystrophin staining and were classified 'mdx-like'. Some mdx fibres, however, had strong 'wt-like' dystrophin signals and were identified as 'revertants'. Split mdx fibres were mostly 'mdx-like' and are not generally 'revertants'. Correlations between membrane dystrophin and DHPR colocalization suggest a restored putative link in 'revertants'. Using the two-micro-electrode-voltage clamp technique, Ca2+-current amplitudes (i(max)) showed very similar behaviours: reduced amplitudes in most aged mdx fibres (as seen exclusively in young mdx mice) and a few mdx fibres, most likely 'revertants', with amplitudes similar to wt or MinD fibres. Ca2+ current activation curves were similar in 'wt-like' and 'mdx-like' aged mdx fibres and are not the cause for the differences in current amplitudes. i(max) amplitudes were fully restored in MinD fibres.We present evidence for a direct/indirect DHPR-dystrophin interaction present in wt, MinD and 'revertant' mdx fibres but absent in remaining mdx fibres. Our imaging technique reliably detects single isolated 'revertant' fibres that could be used for subsequent physiological experiments to study mechanisms and therapy concepts in DMD."
https://openalex.org/W1972487186,"Replication protein A (RPA) is the major single-stranded DNA-binding protein in eukaryotes. RPA is composed of three subunits of 70, 32, and 14 kDa. The N-terminal domain of the 70-kDa subunit (RPA70) has weak DNA binding activity, interacts with proteins, and is involved in cellular DNA damage response. To define the mechanism by which this domain regulates RPA function, we analyzed the function of RPA forms containing a deletion of the N terminus of RPA70 and mutations in the phosphorylation domain of RPA (N-terminal 40 amino acids of the 32-kDa subunit). Although each individual mutation has only modest effects on RPA activity, a form combining both phosphorylation mimetic mutations and a deletion of the N-terminal domain of RPA70 was found to have dramatically altered activity. This combined mutant was defective in binding to short single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides and had altered interactions with proteins that bind to the DNA-binding core of RPA70. These results indicate that in the absence of the N-terminal domain of RPA70, a negatively charged phosphorylation domain disrupts the activity of the core DNA-binding domain of RPA. We conclude that the N-terminal domain of RPA70 functions by interacting with the phosphorylation domain of the 32-kDa subunit and blocking undesirable interactions with the core DNA-binding domain of RPA.

Mice that are heterozygous for a point mutation in the gene for the large subunit of RPA (RPA70) have increased chromosomal instability, elevated cancer rates, and a shortened life span (11Wang Y.

In humans, loss of the chromosomal region containing RPA70 has been associated with a number of cancer types (12Baker S.J. Fearon E.R. Nigro J.M. Hamilton S.R. Preisinger A.C.

RPA is a heterotrimeric (70-, 32-, and 14-kDa subunits) protein composed of multiple structural domains that contain oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide binding folds (OB-fold). OB-folds are found in many ssDNA-binding proteins (16Murzin A.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar, 17Bochkarev A. Bochkareva E. Curr. Opin. Struct.

A schematic of RPA is shown in Fig. 1. The 70-kDa subunit (RPA70) has four OB-fold domains (F, A, B, and C) connected by flexible, unstructured linkers. The OB-fold at the N terminus of RPA70, DBD F, contains a basic cleft that interacts with both ssDNA and proteins involved in DNA metabolism (20Daughdrill G.W. Ackerman J. Isern N.G. Botuyan M.V.

Analyses of DBD F in yeast have suggested that this domain has a role in DNA repair and the cellular response to DNA damage (10Kim H.S. Brill S.J. Mol. Cell.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3533-3537Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, the molecular functions of DBD F remain poorly understood. DBD F is connected to the high affinity DNA-binding core of RPA (DBD A and DBD B) by a long, ∼67-residue flexible linker (26Olson K.E. Narayanaswami P. Vise P.D. Lowry D.F. Wold M.S. Daughdrill G.W.

DBD C, at the C terminus of RPA70, is required for heterotrimeric complex formation and has also been shown to interact weakly with DNA (30Lao Y. Gomes X.V. Ren Y.J. Taylor J.S. Wold M.S.

The 32-kDa (RPA32) and 14-kDa (RPA14) subunits each have one OB-fold domain called DBD D and DBD E, respectively, and are required for RPA complex formation. DBD D interacts weakly with DNA and although DBD E of RPA14 was originally defined solely on structural similarity (1Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar, 2Iftode C. Daniely Y. Borowiec J.A. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 34: 141-180Crossref Scopus (395) Google Scholar), it has recently been shown to interact with single-stranded telomeric DNA sequences (34Gao H. Cervantes R.B. Mandell E.K. Otero J.H. Lundblad V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2007; 14: 208-214Crossref Scopus (229) Google Scholar). RPA32 also contains an N-terminal phosphorylation domain and a C-terminal winged helix domain (35Mer G.

The phosphorylation domain is flexible in solution as indicated by proteolytic and NMR analyses (35Mer G. Bochkarev A. Gupta R. Bochkareva E. Frappier L. Ingles C.J. Edwards A.M. Chazin W.J.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5586-5595Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). RPA is phosphorylated during the cell cycle and in response to cellular DNA damage. Low levels of phosphorylation by the Cdk2 family of kinases occur in S phase and G2/M phase of cells undergoing normal growth (37Fang F. Newport J.W. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 983-994Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hyperphosphorylation of RPA by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase family of kinases (including DNA-PK, ATM, and ATR) is observed after cellular DNA damage (reviewed in Refs. 4Fanning E. Klimovich V. Nager A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4126-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 19Binz S.K. Sheehan A.M. Wold M.S.

Phosphorylation primarily occurs on the N-terminal domain of RPA32 (the phosphorylation domain) (35Mer G. Bochkarev A. Gupta R. Bochkareva E. Frappier L. Ingles C.J. Edwards A.M. Chazin W.J.

Phosphopeptide mapping and residue-specific antibodies have identified at least 9 sites of phosphorylation in the N-terminal domain of RPA32 (39Zernik-Kobak M. Vasunia K. Connelly M. Anderson C.W.

It has also been reported that multiple phosphorylation events are needed for changes in RPA localization (44Vassin V.M. Wold M.S. Borowiec J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1930-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar); however, the subset of sites phosphorylated in the N-terminal phosphorylation domain in the cellular response seem to vary depending upon the type of DNA damage (41Cruet-Hennequart S. Glynn M.T. Murillo L.S. Coyne S. Carty M.P. DNA Repair. 2008; 7: 582-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 42Olson E. Nievera C.J. Klimovich V. Fanning E. Wu X. J. Biol.

In yeast, a site in DBD D of RPA32 is phosphorylated in vivo during meiosis and a site in RPA70 is phosphorylated after DNA damage (45Treuner K. Findeisen M. Strausfeld U. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15556-15561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 46Kim H.S. Brill S.J. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 1321-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Neither site appears to affect resistance to DNA damaging agents but phosphorylation of the DBD D site is required for efficient recombination (46Kim H.S. Brill S.J. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 1321-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 47Mallory J.C. Bashkirov V.I. Trujillo K.M. Solinger J.A. Dominska M. Sung P. Heyer W.D. Petes T.D.

Neither of these phosphorylation sites is conserved in human RPA. Phosphorylation of human RPA70 and individual domains has been demonstrated in vitro (45Treuner K. Findeisen M. Strausfeld U. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15556-15561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 49Nuss J.E. Patrick S.M. Oakley G.G. Alter G.M. Robison J.G. Dixon K. Turchi J.J.

One phosphorylation site identified in a fragment of RPA70 containing DBDs AB causes decreased DNA binding when phosphorylated by Chk1 in vitro (50Liu J.S. Kuo S.R. Melendy T. DNA Repair. 2006; 5: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). There are suggestions that human RPA may be phosphorylated at sites other than the N-terminal phosphorylation domain of RPA32 (42Olson E. Nievera C.J. Klimovich V. Fanning E. Wu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39517-39533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar); however, specific phosphorylation sites within human RPA70 and RPA32 have not been confirmed. Although RPA phosphorylation has been studied extensively, its role in the cell remains poorly understood (reviewed in Refs. 4Fanning E. Klimovich V. Nager A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4126-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 19Binz S.K. Sheehan A.M. Wold M.S.

Nevertheless, some general characteristics of RPA phosphorylation have been observed. RPA binding to DNA causes a conformational change that promotes efficient phosphorylation (51Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 52Blackwell L.J. Borowiec J.A. Mastrangelo I.A. Mol. Cell.

RPA is localized to sites of DNA damage and co-localizes with a number of proteins required for checkpoint activation and DNA repair (Refs. 38Zou Y. Liu Y. Wu X. Shell S.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 208: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 42Olson E. Nievera C.J. Klimovich V. Fanning E. Wu X. J. Biol.

Biochem. 2006; 99: 1452-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar and references therein). There have been several studies that suggest a role for RPA phosphorylation in cellular DNA replication and DNA repair. Extracts made from cells subjected to DNA damage are inactive for in vitro SV40 replication. These extracts contained high levels of phosphorylated RPA and activity can be restored with the addition of unphosphorylated RPA (55Carty M.P. Zernik-Kobak M. McGrath S. Dixon K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2114-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 56Wang Y. Zhou X.Y. Wang H. Wang H.Y. Huq M.S. Iliakis G. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 1391-1397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In vivo analysis of phosphorylation-mimetic forms of RPA showed that they do not localize well to sites of DNA replication suggesting a potential role of RPA phosphorylation in the regulation of DNA replication (42Olson E. Nievera C.J. Klimovich V. Fanning E. Wu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39517-39533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 44Vassin V.M. Wold M.S. Borowiec J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1930-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation does not have any effect on nucleotide excision repair in vitro (58Pan Z.-Q. Park C.-H. Amin A.A. Hurwitz J. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4636-4640Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 59Ariza R.R. Keyse S.M. Moggs J.G. Wood R.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 433-440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a role for RPA phosphorylation was observed in an in vitro mismatch repair assay: wild-type and a phosphorylation mimetic form of RPA had different activities in the steps of excision and synthesis steps of mismatch repair (60Guo S. Zhang Y. Yuan F. Gao Y. Gu L. Wong I. Li G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21607-21616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cuvier and co-workers (61Cuvier O. Lutzmann M. Mechali M. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 516-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) showed that in a Xenopus egg extract replication system the cdk2 phosphorylation sites in the phosphorylation domain of RPA32 are essential for chromatin disassembly in interphase. Although the cellular role of RPA phosphorylation remains incomplete, together these studies suggest that RPA phosphorylation is important for regulating cellular DNA metabolism in response to DNA damage and may have a role in cell cycle progression. Phosphorylation causes several changes in the biochemical properties of the RPA complex. Phosphorylated RPA or RPA with phosphorylation mimetic mutations shows altered interactions with double-stranded DNA (62Binz S.K. Lao Y. Lowry D.F. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35584-35591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 63Oakley G.G. Patrick S.M. Yao J. Carty M.P. Turchi J.J. Dixon K. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3255-3264Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The domains of RPA essential for double-stranded DNA binding are the DNA-binding core (DBD A and B) and DBD F (64Lao Y. Lee C.G. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3974-3984Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In addition, multiple RPA-protein interactions are altered after phosphorylation (63Oakley G.G. Patrick S.M. Yao J. Carty M.P. Turchi J.J. Dixon K. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3255-3264Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 65Robison J.G. Elliott J. Dixon K. Oakley G.G. J. Biol.

The proteins affected by RPA phosphorylation also primarily interact with the N terminus of RPA70 (DBD F or DBD A). These findings suggest that phosphorylation induces a conformational change(s) in RPA involving both N-terminal domains of RPA32 and RPA70. Supporting this model is the finding that a phosphomimetic peptide has been shown to directly interact with DBD F (62Binz S.K. Lao Y. Lowry D.F. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35584-35591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This type of interaction may be a general mechanism of RPA regulation as DBD F has also been shown to interact with peptides from the transactivation domains of p53 and ATRIP (23Bochkareva E. Kaustov L. Ayed A. Yi G.S. Lu Y. Pineda-Lucena A. Liao J.C. Okorokov A.L. Milner J. Arrowsmith C.H. Bochkarev A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2007; 27: 3367-3377Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation domain of RPA32 has similar characteristics to these transactivation domains as they all are unstructured and negatively charged (when RPA32 is phosphorylated). Furthermore, RPA has partial sequence homology with the transactivation domain of p53 (RPA32, 28GSPAPSQA35, versus p53, 32LSPLPSQA39) (23Bochkareva E. Kaustov L. Ayed A. Yi G.S. Lu Y. Pineda-Lucena A. Liao J.C. Okorokov A.L. Milner J. Arrowsmith C.H. Bochkarev A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15412-15417Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that phosphorylation may induce conformational changes within the binding core of RPA (DBD A and DBD B) after phosphorylation (69Liu Y. Kvaratskhelia M. Hess S. Qu Y. Zou Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32775-32783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To obtain a better understanding of the role of DBD F and the structural and functional changes that occur after phosphorylation, we have carried out functional analysis of multiple RPA mutant forms of RPA. These RPA mutants combine a deletion of DBD F from RPA70 with mutations in the phosphorylation domain of RPA32. We show that combining a deletion of DBD F with a phosphorylation mimetic form of RPA32 resulted in a RPA complex that had dramatically altered interactions with both DNA and Rad51. These data support the model that phosphorylation induces changes in RPA conformation. These findings also suggest that DBD F has two regulatory functions: (i) it interacts with protein, DNA, and the negatively charged phosphorylation domain of RPA32 to modulate RPA function and (ii) it prevents the negatively charged phosphorylation domain from forming an dysfunctional RPA conformation. Our results show that the latter conformation causes dramatic changes in the activity of the RPA complex. Materials—[γ-32P]ATP (6000μCi/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Rad51 and the Rad51 primary rabbit antibody were gifts from the Radding laboratory (70Gupta R.C. Golub E.I. Wold M.S. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The phosphate-citrate buffer with sodium perborate capsules (0.05 m phosphate citrate and 0.03% perborate at pH 5.0 in 100 ml of water) and o-phenylenediamine tablets (200 μmol/tablet) were also purchased from Sigma. The three oligonucleotides used in binding assays (dT30, dT20, and dT15) were purchased from Sigma Genosys. Buffers—HI buffer contained 30 mm Hepes (diluted from 1 m stock at pH 7.8), 1 mm dithiolthreitol, 0.25 mm EDTA, 0.5% (w/v) inositol, and 0.01% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. 1× Tris borate/EDTA (1× TBE) gel buffer contained 89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA. DNA Templates and Manipulation—A 40-bp dsDNA fragment derived from the early palindrome region of the SV40 origin was made for helix destabilizing studies by labeling an oligonucleotide (SV40 top, 5′-CTCCAAAAAAGCCTCCTCACTACTTCTGGAATAGCTCA-GA-3′) with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biosystems) following the manufacturer's recommendations. The labeled DNA was separated from free ATP with a P30 Tris chromatography column (Bio-Rad) following the manufacturer's specifications and annealed to equal molar concentrations of the complementary sequence (SV40 bottom: 5′-TCTGAGCTATTCCAGAAGTAGTGAGGAGGCTTTTTTGGAG-3′) to make a 40-nt double-stranded DNA substrate for helix destabilization assays. A double-stranded 40-nt substrate containing an 8-nt bubble was made by annealing SV40 top to SV40 bottom B (5′-TCTGAGCTATTCCAGAGACGACAGGGAGGCTTTTTTGGAG-3′). The underlined bases indicate the region of non-complementary bases. Annealing reactions (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm NaCl) were incubated in a Midwest Scientific PCR Sprint machine at 95 °C for 3 min followed by a transition to 22 °C by a rate of 0.01 °C/s with a final hold temperature of 4 °C. Annealing was monitored by 15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (1×TBE). In all experiments, greater than 95% of labeled DNA was in the double-stranded form.

https://openalex.org/W2004284339,"X-prolyl aminopeptidases catalyze the removal of a penultimate prolyl residue from the N termini of peptides. Mammalian X-prolyl aminopeptidases are shown to be responsible for the degradation of bradykinin, a blood pressure regulator peptide, and have been linked to myocardial infarction. The x-ray crystal structure of human cytosolic X-prolyl aminopeptidase (XPN-PEP1) was solved at a resolution of 1.6Å. The structure reveals a dimer with a unique three-domain organization in each subunit, rather than the two domains common to all other known structures of X-prolyl aminopeptidase and prolidases. The C-terminal catalytic domain of XPNPEP1 coordinates two metal ions and shares a similar fold with other prolyl aminopeptidases. Metal content analysis and activity assays confirm that the enzyme is double Mn(II) dependent for its activity, which contrasts with the previous notion that each XPNPEP1 subunit contains only one Mn(II) ion. Activity assays on an E41A mutant demonstrate that the acidic residue, which was considered as a stabilizing factor in the protonation of catalytic residue His498, plays only a marginal role in catalysis. Further mutagenesis reveals the significance of the N-terminal domain and dimerization for the activity of XPNPEP1, and we provide putative structural explanations for their functional roles. Structural comparisons further suggest mechanisms for substrate selectivity in different X-prolyl peptidases.

X-prolyl aminopeptidases (aminopeptidase P or AP-P; E.C. 3.4.11.9) are found in a variety of organisms including mammals, yeasts, and bacteria. There are two forms of mammalian AP-P in terms of their cellular locations: a cytosolic form (XPNPEP1) and a membrane-bound form (XPNPEP2). Both forms can degrade bradykinin, a blood pressure-regulating peptide, and are inhibited by the specific peptide inhibitor apstatin (1Prechel M.M. Orawski A.T. Maggiora L.L. Simmons W.H. J.

The cytosolic form of AP-P has been identified in human leukocytes (4Rusu I. Yaron A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), platelets (5Vanhoof G. De Meester I. Goossens F. Hendriks D. Scharpe S. Yaron A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 44: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and rat and guinea pig brains (6Harbeck H.T. Mentlein R.

J. 1990; 267: 509-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A previous study has shown that injection of apstatin into mice can reduce myocardial infarction severity (11Wolfrum S. Richardt G. Dominiak P. Katus H.A. Dendorfer A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 134: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), suggesting a pathological role of X-prolyl aminopeptidases in mammals. Human XPNPEP1 consists of 623 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 69,886 Da. The enzyme purified from human leukocytes exists as a dimer of 140 kDa (4Rusu I. Yaron A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The catalytic activity of the enzyme is enhanced in the presence of Mn2+ (3Cottrell G.S. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15121-15128Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Each 70-kDa subunit of the enzyme was thought to contain only one Mn2+ ion in a previous study (3Cottrell G.S. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15121-15128Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). A Blast search against the NCBI sequence data base revealed similarity in the C-terminal catalytic domains among X-prolyl peptidases of known structures. In contrast, the overall sequence homology between human XPNPEP1 and other X-prolyl peptidases is low. In particular, XPNPEP1 is significantly larger in size than other members of the X-prolyl peptidases (about 40-50 kDa). Here we report the crystal structure of human XPNPEP1 at 1.6-Å resolution. Whereas other X-prolyl peptidases with known structures all contain two domains, the XPNPEP1 structure possesses a novel three-domain organization with a conserved C-terminal catalytic domain. In contrast to previous reports, we identified the presence of a double Mn2+ binding site in the catalytic domain, both in the crystal structure and in solution. Cloning and Expression—The cDNA of wild type (WT) XPN-PEP1 and that of a domain I-truncated mutant (residues 162-623) were cloned into the pET28a vector (Novagen) between SalI and HindIII sites. E41A (i.e. Glu41 to Ala substitution) and W477E point mutants were produced from the constructed pET28a-wild type XPNPEP1 plasmid with a one-step overlap extension PCR method by using the Easy Mutagenesis System kit (Transgen). All XPNPEP1 variants were expressed as an N-terminal His6-tagged protein in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) in LB medium supplemented with 1 mm MnCl2 (manganese-rich LB).

For expression, E. coli cells cultured overnight were diluted 100-fold in fresh medium and cultured at 37 °C to an optical density of about 0.8 at 600 nm. The cell culture was then cooled down to 16 °C and induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. It was grown for another 20 h at 16 °C with shaking at 220 rpm, and then the cells were harvested by centrifugation. Protein Purification—The harvested cells were resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 500 mm NaCl, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) and lysed by sonication. The released His6-tagged protein was purified following standard protocols of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen). It was eluted from the resin with buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 500 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 300 mm imidazole) and dialyzed against a salt-free buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)). Further purification was performed with a Hitrap Q HP affinity column (Amersham Biosciences) and the final protein sample was dialyzed against a buffer of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 20 mm NaCl. Crystallization—Crystals of native or selenomethionyl-labeled protein were grown by the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method. The reservoir contained 20% (v/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 400, 0.15 m CaCl2, and 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.5). A typical hanging drop consisted of 2 μl of protein solution (20 mg/ml) mixed with 2 μl of the reservoir solution. Large (over 0.5 mm) colorless block-shaped crystals suitable for diffraction were grown within a week at 16 °C. Data Collection, Phasing, and Model Refinement—Crystallographic data from the crystals of native and selenomethionyllabeled protein were collected on beamlines BL5A and BL17A of the Photon Factory synchrotron facility (KEK, Tsukuba, Japan). The diffraction images were integrated and scaled using HKL2000 (12Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). A 3.5-Å resolution structure of selenomethionyl-labeled XPNPEP1 was solved by the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction phasing method at the selenium absorption edge using SOLVE/RESOLVE (13Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). The 3.5-Å resolution phases were extended to 1.6 Å using the native data set and the program ARP/WARP (14Blanc E. Roversi P. Vonrhein C. Flensburg C. Lea S.M. Bricogne G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2210-2221Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). The program automatically built about 80% of residues, and the remainder were built manually with COOT (15Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar). The structure was refined with REFMAC5 (16Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Figures were drawn with the program PYMOL (DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA). Enzyme Activity Assays—The enzyme activity was assayed with bradykinin (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) or the Arg-Pro-Pro tripeptide (synthesized by SBS Genetech, Beijing, China) as the substrate in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 100 mm NaCl at 37 °C for 5 min (100 μl final volume). The free amino acid released by the enzyme was detected with the o-phthalaldehyde, 5-mercaptoethanol reagent as previously described (9Simmons W.H. Orawski A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4897-4903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence of the o-phthalaldehyde derivate was measured with a microplate reader (Type 374, Thermo Electron Corporation). For kinetic analysis, assays were prepared with a range of concentrations of bradykinin (0.01-0.10 mm) or Arg-Pro-Pro (0.02-0.20 mm) and 1 μg of the purified WT enzyme. To examine the effects of different factors on the enzyme activity, 0.09 mm Arg-Pro-Pro and 1 μg of purified enzyme variant were used in a 100-μl assay. To verify the effect of EDTA, purified WT enzyme was incubated in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 100 mm NaCl with 50 mm EDTA for 10 min, and dialyzed against 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 100 mm NaCl prior to measuring its relative activity. Other Assays—Analysis of the total metal content was carried out using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, Thermo) at the Tsinghua University Analysis Center (Beijing, China). Purified protein samples without crystallization trial were extensively dialyzed against 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 100 mm NaCl before ICP-MS analysis. Analytical ultracentrifugations (AUC) were performed with the sedimentation velocity method at 58,000 rpm at the Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Beijing, China). The protein samples for AUC were prepared at a concentration of about 0.5 mg/ml in a buffer of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 100 mm NaCl. The AUC data were processed as a c(M) distribution model (17Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar). Structure Determination and Refinement—The structure of human XPNPEP1 was solved at 1.6-Å resolution using the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction method. Refinement of the XPNPEP1 structure resulted in a final model with a crystallographic R-factor (Rcryst) of 0.154 and a free R-factor (Rfree) of 0.195. One asymmetric unit of this C2221 crystal form contained a single protein molecule composed of 623 amino acid residues. The polypeptide chain was complete with the exception of the N-terminal His6 tag, the N-terminal residues 1-2, and the C-terminal residues 620-623, which were not included in the final model because of poor electron density. For the same reason, Asn553, Arg554, and the side chain of Phe509 were assigned zero occupancy. All other residues had excellent electron density, and the final average temperature factor (B) was 27.2 Å2. An asymmetric unit also contained 1,055 ordered water molecules, one partial PEG molecule containing six ethylene glycol residues, and four metal ions. Of the four metal ions, two major ones localized at the active site were refined as full occupancy Mn2+ with temperature factors of 14.8 Å2 (Mn1 in Fig. 1A) and 17.7 Å2 (Mn2), respectively. The two minor ions were refined as full occupancy Ca2+ and Na+, respectively. Although crystals were grown in 0.15 m CaCl2, native XPNPEP1 treated with EDTA (followed by dialysis before crystallization) yielded no crystal but thick precipitation under the same condition, suggesting that the two active-site metal ions observed in the native crystal protein were unlikely to be calcium ions replacing Mn2+ during crystallization. Besides the mobile Asn553, only Glu434, affected by the inter-molecule Ca2+, localizes in the Ramachandran unfavorable region. Experimental structure factors and the coordinates of the refined model have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with access code 3CTZ.

Open table in a new tab Monomer Structure—The crystal structure unveiled a novel three-domain subunit for XPNPEP1. It includes an N-terminal domain (domain I, residues 1-161), a middle domain (domain II, residues 162-322), and a C-terminal domain (domain III, residues 323-623) (Fig. 1A). Secondary structure elements in each domain were defined by the DSSP program (18Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12421) Google Scholar) (supplemental materials Table S1). Domain I is composed of a six-stranded (strands β1-β6) mixed β-sheet flanked by six α-helices (helices α1-α6). The topological order of the β-sheet is β4-β3-β2-β1-β5-β6, where strand β2 points in the opposite direction from the rest. Four helices (α1, α2, α3, and α6) are localized on one side of the sheet, and the remaining two (α4 and α5) on the other. The structure of domain II is similar to that of domain I. The core of domain II is also made up of a six-stranded (strands β8 and β10-β14) mixed β-sheet flanked by six α-helices (helices α8-α13). In addition, domain II contains a small antiparallel β-sheet (β7 and β9) and a short helix (α7) outside the core. Fig. 2A shows the result of secondary-structure matching superposition (19Krissinel E. Henrick K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2256-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3189) Google Scholar) between domains I and II, with 118 residues aligned to give a root mean square deviation of 2.6 Å. The two domains are related by a pure rotation of 150°. Domain III contains one strongly curved five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (sheet I, β16-β17-β20-β26-β25), and two additional antiparallel β-sheets (sheet II, β15-β18-β19, and sheet III, β23-β22-β24-β27-β28-β21). On the outer face of the three sheets lie six α-helices (α14-α19). Of these, helices α14-α17 are oriented roughly parallel to the strands in sheet I, and α18 and α19 are near-perpendicular to the former helices. Strands β27 and β28 form a short hairpin structure that protrudes from the core. Domains I and II are primarily held together by hydrophobic interactions. Domains II and III are linked by the residues between helix α13 and helix α14 (residues 321-323). Homodimer—Our solution studies, including gel filtration and AUC, revealed that XPNPEP1 proteins primarily exist as 140-kDa dimers (Fig. 3), which is consistent with previous reports (3Cottrell G.S. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15121-15128Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 4Rusu I. Yaron A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure, two symmetry-related XPNPEP1 molecules (named as subunits A and B) are related by a dyad to form a homodimer (Fig. 1B). The two subunits are mainly held together by hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 1C). The side chains of Tyr439, Leu481, Leu484, and Tyr526 in subunit A and Tyr549, Phe551 in the β27-β28 hairpin of subunit B form one hydrophobic core. The symmetry equivalent hydrophobic residues form the second hydrophobic core of the dimer interface. Residue Pro460 and the side chains of Phe459, Leu468, Phe471, and Trp477 in subunit A, together with their symmetry equivalents, form a third hydrophobic core. In addition to these hydrophobic interactions, a salt bridge between Glu442A (i.e. Glu442 of subunit A) and Lys548B and their symmetric counterparts, together with two pairs of hydrogen bonds between Glu442A/B and Tyr549B/A, and between Leu467A/B and Ser470B/A, also help to stabilize the interaction between the two subunits. Approximately 1,600 Å2 (6%) of the solvent accessible surface area from each subunit is buried upon dimer formation. Among the above discussed residues, Trp477 plays a vital role for dimerization. Mutating this Trp to Glu abolished the capability of the enzyme to form a native dimer in our AUC studies (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, a small peak appeared at the position of 120 kDa in the AUC studies on the W477E mutant. We speculate that it represents a fraction of monomer or dimer with abnormal molecule shapes. Active Site—The putative active site is located in the inner (concave) surface of the curved β-sheets of domain III (Fig. 1A) on the basis of comparison with homologous structures, such as the structure of E. coli AP-P (20Wilce M.C. Bond C.S. Dixon N.E. Freeman H.C. Guss J.M. Lilley P.E. Wilce J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3472-3477Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 21Graham S.C. Maher M.J.

Kralicek A.V. Dixon N.E. Guss J.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 964-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Two well coordinated metal ions were observed in this active site (Fig. 4). ICP-MS data consistently indicated that the molar ratio between Mn2+ and the 70-kDa XPNPEP1 subunit was 1.79:1, whereas the content of other common metals was negligible (Table 2). Although our crystallized XPNPEP1 protein sample was expressed with manganese-rich LB media and appeared clear, we carried out similar expression of the protein in plain LB media (i.e. without manganese supplementation) and interestingly obtained some “red protein.” ICP-MS analysis on this red protein sample indicated that the protein contains mainly iron (0.73:1), manganese (0.70:1), and magnesium (0.41:1) ions (Table 2).

Open table in a new tab In our crystal structures, both Mn2+ ions are well coordinated. One of the Mn2+ ions (termed Mn1, see Fig. 4) is coordinated by the Oδ-1 atoms of Asp415 (2.15 Å) and Asp426 (2.14 Å), the Oϵ-1 atom of Glu537 (2.19 Å), and two water molecules (termed W1 and W2) with Mn2+-ligand distances of 2.23 and 2.27 Å, respectively. These Mn2+-ligands form an approximate trigonal-bipyramidal coordination geometry, with the Oδ-1 atoms of the two aspartate residues and W1 in the equatorial plane, and the Oϵ-1 atom of the glutamate residue and W2 on the axis. The coordination sphere of the second Mn2+ ion (termed Mn2) is comprised of the Oδ-2 atom of Asp426 (2.37 Å), the Oϵ-2 atoms of Glu523 (2.27 Å) and Glu537 (2.26 Å), Nϵ-2 atom of residue His489 (2.27 Å), and two water molecules (W1, 2.31 Å and W3, 2.17 Å), which complete a distorted octahedral coordination. Furthermore, W1 and the carboxylate groups of Asp426 and Glu537 act as bridges between the two Mn2+ ions. The side chains of His395, His485, His498, and Glu41 surrounding the two Mn2+ ions are likely to play roles in recognition and catalysis during the substrate hydrolysis, according to studies on the equivalent residues in the active site of E. coli AP-P (22Graham S.C.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 964-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), which shares an almost identical active site with XPNPEP1. Activity Assay—Activity assays on the same enzyme protein sample used for the crystallization were performed with the tripeptide Arg-Pro-Pro and bradykinin as substrates. The assays were performed in Mn2+-free buffer and gave a Km value of 308 (±8) μm and a kcat of 7.7 s-1 on Arg-Pro-Pro, whereas Km was measured as 78 (±9) μm and kcat as 3.8 s-1 for bradykinin. Our Km and kcat values on bradykinin were comparable with previous reports (3Cottrell G.S. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15121-15128Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 5Vanhoof G. De Meester I. Goossens F. Hendriks D. Scharpe S. Yaron A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 44: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, the red enzyme (enzyme expressed from plain LB) showed 44% activity of the Mn2+-bound enzyme, and the activity of the enzyme dropped to 10% after treatment with 50 mm EDTA. Although not directly involved in metal binding, Glu41 is the only residue located outside of the catalytic domain but close to the active site in the three-dimensional structure (Fig. 4). To test its function in catalysis, we made a mutant substituting Glu41 with Ala. This mutant maintained 91% of the WT activity, suggesting that it only marginally affects the activity of the enzyme. In contrast, another mutant, W477E, designed to block dimer formation and a domain I truncation mutant showed only 6 and 2% of the WT activity, respectively (Fig. 5). XPNPEP1 Contains Two Mn2+ Ions in the Active Site—Prior to our structural study, Cottrell and colleagues (3Cottrell G.S. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15121-15128Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) had reported some significant work on the characterization of recombinant XPNPEP1. In particular, they assayed the effects of different metal ions and chelating agents on the activity of XPNPEP1, and identified the enzyme as Mn2+ dependent for its activity. It was based on this observation that we chose manganese-rich LB in our experiments to avoid Mn2+ depletion during protein expression. Nevertheless, their conclusion that each 70-kDa XPNPEP1 subunit contains only one metal ion was markedly different from the observation in our XPNPEP1 structure. The XPNPEP1 crystal structure displays two well coordinated metal ions with very strong electron density in each active site. The electron density map for the two metal ions can be observed even when contoured at the level of +20 standard deviations. To further investigate the metal content of the enzyme, an ICP-MS analysis on the XPNPEP1 recombinant protein expressed from manganese-rich LB was performed and revealed that the enzyme contains 1.79 Mn2+ ions per 70-kDa subunit and much lower levels of other metals. This result indicates the molar ratio between Mn2+ and the enzyme is nearly 2:1, which is entirely consistent with our structural observation. To study the effects of Mn2+ from the cell culture medium on the metal content of recombinant XPNPEP1, we expressed the enzyme in plain LB medium following the method of Cottrell and colleagues (3Cottrell G.S. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15121-15128Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). ICP-MS analysis of this sample revealed three major metal contents, i.e. magnesium, manganese, and iron ions in the enzyme with the molar ratio 0.41, 0.70, and 0.73 per 70-kDa subunit. Although the molar ratio between Mn2+ and protein dropped to a level comparable with the previous report (0.99:1), the molar ratio between the total metal content and protein remains nearly 2:1, which is consistent with our structural observation. The detailed differences in metal content between our study and that of Cottrell et al. (3Cottrell G.S. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15121-15128Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) may be due to different expression conditions, including temperature and induction time. For example, we used a “slow” expression method at 16 °C for 20 h. In contrast, their method was a quick one at 40 °C for 3 h. We believe that slow cell growth allows the recombinant protein to fold properly and to obtain the optimum metal ion content. Moreover, in our case, the difference in metal composition between XPNPEP1 samples expressed from plain and manganese-enriched LB medium was probably caused by the depletion of Mn2+ in the former, because the protein yields from both media were as high as 30 mg/liter of E. coli culture. The Mn2+ content of XPNPEP1 expressed from plain LB was 39% (0.70:1.79) of that from manganese-rich LB and is fairly close to their activity ratio (44%). This suggests that only the portion of XPNPEP1 in which two Mn2+ ions are coordinated possesses catalytic activity, whereas the remaining portion, which coordinates either two magnesium or iron ions, presents little or no catalytic activity. Here, we made an assumption that XPNPEP1 preferentially binds the same type of ions in the two metal-binding sites, based on avai"

Notably, c-Fos target genes include members of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) gene family and c-fos is overexpressed in a number of metastatic cancers, suggesting its direct involvement in this process. Here, we reveal that c-Fos-mediated transcriptional activation is regulated by the protein arginine methyltransferase CARM1 and by all three members of the p160 protein family of coactivators. Carm1-deficient cells showed a dramatic reduction in the expression level of c-Fos target genes MMP-1b, -3, and -13, indicating a major role for CARM1 in regulating the expression of these genes. RNA interference combined with quantitative polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that CARM1 and p160 proteins synergize to activate expression of MMP-1b, -3, and -13 in vivo. Furthermore, we show that CARM1 also regulates MMP expression at the post-transcriptional level, either positively or negatively. Our data indicate that CARM1 can play a dual role in the expression of AP-1 target genes involved in cancer or other diseases by acting at the transcriptional as well as at the post-transcriptional levels."
https://openalex.org/W2038632434,"NAD+-dependent DNA ligases (LigAs) are ubiquitous in bacteria and essential for growth. LigA enzymes have a modular structure in which a central catalytic core composed of nucleotidyltransferase and oligonucleotide-binding (OB) domains is linked via a tetracysteine zinc finger to distal helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) and BRCT (BRCA1-like C-terminal) domains. The OB and HhH domains contribute prominently to the protein clamp formed by LigA around nicked duplex DNA. Here we conducted a structure-function analysis of the OB and HhH domains of Escherichia coli LigA by alanine scanning and conservative substitutions, entailing 43 mutations at 22 amino acids. We thereby identified essential functional groups in the OB domain that engage the DNA phosphodiester backbone flanking the nick (Arg333); penetrate the minor grove and distort the nick (Val383 and Ile384); or stabilize the OB fold (Arg379). The essential constituents of the HhH domain include: four glycines (Gly455, Gly489, Gly521, Gly553), which bind the phosphate backbone across the minor groove at the outer margins of the LigA-DNA interface; Arg487, which penetrates the minor groove at the outer margin on the 3 ®-OH side of the nick; and Arg446, which promotes protein clamp formation via contacts to the nucleotidyltransferase domain. We find that the BRCT domain is required in its entirety for effective nick sealing and AMP-dependent supercoil relaxation.

Domain Ia is unique to NAD+-dependent ligases and is the determinant of NAD+ specificity (9Sriskanda V. Moyer R.W. Shuman S. J. Biol.

During the ligase adenylylation reaction, the Ia domain closes over the NAD+ nucleotide bound by the NTase domain, grabs the NMN moiety of NAD+ via multiple contacts to essential amino acids in domain Ia, and thereby orients the NMN leaving group apical to the attacking lysine nucleophile (Lys115 in E. coli LigA) (6Gajiwala K.S.

Cell. 2007; 26: 257-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) revealed that LigA encircles the DNA helix as a C-shaped protein clamp (Fig. 1). The protein-DNA interface entails extensive DNA contacts by the NTase, OB, and HhH domains over a 19-bp segment of duplex DNA centered about the nick (Fig. 1). The NTase domain binds to the broken DNA strands at and flanking the nick, the OB domain contacts the continuous template strand surrounding the nick, and the HhH domain binds both strands across the minor groove at the periphery of the footprint. The zinc finger module bridges the OB and HhH domains, and it contributes only a single main-chain amide contact to the DNA backbone (8Nandakumar J. Nair P.A. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 257-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Domain Ia makes no contacts to the DNA duplex, consistent with its dispensability for catalysis of strand closure on an AppDNA substrate (10Sriskanda V. Shuman S. J. Biol.

We thereby defined a suite of amino acid functional groups, distant from the LigA active site, that are essential for nick sealing. We also conducted a deletion analysis and alanine scan of the BRCT domain of E. coli LigA guided by an NMR structure of the BRCT domain of Thermus thermophilus LigA. 3G. Sahota, B. L. Dixon, Y. P.

Ligase Mutants—Missense and nonsense mutations were introduced by PCR into the pET-EcoLigA expression plasmid as described previously (12Sriskanda V. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3953-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The entire ligA gene was sequenced in every case to confirm the desired mutation and exclude the acquisition of unwanted changes during PCR amplification and cloning. The expression plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). Mutant and wild-type ligases were purified from the soluble lysates of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced BL21(DE3) cells by nickel-agarose chromatography as described (12Sriskanda V. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3953-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad dye reagent with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Nick Ligation—Reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 μm NAD+, 1 pmol of 5′ 32P-labeled nicked duplex DNA substrate, and aliquots of serial 2-fold dilutions of wild-type or mutant ligases were incubated at 22 °C for 20 min. The products were resolved by electrophoresis through a 15-cm 18% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris borate, 1.25 mm EDTA). The extents of ligation were determined by scanning the gel with a Fujix BAS2500 imager. The specific activities of wild-type and mutant ligases were determined from the slopes of the titration curves in the linear range of enzyme dependence. The activities of the mutant ligases were normalized to the specific activity of wild-type LigA protein purified in parallel with that mutant and assayed in a parallel with the same preparation of radiolabeled DNA substrate. On average, the wild-type LigA sealed 26 ± 4.9 fmol of nicks per fmol of input enzyme (average value for 10 different titration experiments with three different preparations of recombinant wild-type LigA).

The template strand interface of the OB domain spans six consecutive phosphates centered about the nick (Figs. 1 and 2A). The OB domain makes additional contacts with the DNA in the minor groove opposite the adenylylated nick (Fig. 2B). Val383 and Ile384 project into the minor groove and make van der Waals interactions with the terminal cytosine bases on either side of the nick and the penultimate pentose sugar on the 5′ side of the nick. Arg379 makes water-mediated contacts in the minor groove to the base and sugar of the two template strand nucleosides flanking the 3′-OH at the nick. Gln386 makes a water-mediated contact to the 5′-PO4 strand (Fig. 2B). To probe whether any of the aforementioned side chain contacts to DNA are functionally relevant, we introduced single-alanine substitutions for Gln330, Arg342, Asn355, Arg379, and Gln386. Double-alanine changes were introduced at vicinal residues Arg333-Thr334 and Val383-Ile384. The wild-type and mutated E. coli LigA proteins were produced as N-terminal His10 fusions and purified in parallel from soluble bacterial extracts by nickel-agarose chromatography (Fig. 3A, left panel). The extent of ligation of singly nicked 3′-OH/5′PO4 DNA by wild-type LigA and each mutant was gauged as a function of input enzyme, and the specific activities were normalized to the wild-type value (defined as 100%). Our operational definition of an important amino acid (or dipeptide) was one at which alanine substitution reduced nick sealing activity to ≤10% of the wild-type level. By this criterion, the Arg333-Thr334 dipeptide, Arg379, and the Val383-Ile384 dipeptide were deemed essential for ligation (Fig. 3B, left panel). An alignment of the primary structures of the OB domains of LigA enzymes from various bacterial genera (including Haemophilus, Mycobacterium, Bacillus, Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, and Thermus) and eukaryal DNA viruses (mimivirus and entomopoxvirus) reveals that the Arg333, Arg379, Val383, and Ile384 side chains are conserved in all of the LigA proteins (Fig. 2C). Thr334 is conserved in the LigA enzymes from bacteria, with the exception of Thermus filiformis (Fig. 2C). By contrast, the alanine mutation at Gln330 (which is not conserved in the LigA family; Fig. 2C) had no apparent effect on nick sealing, signifying that the bifurcated direct and water-mediated contacts of the Gln330 amide group to two of the phosphates of the template DNA strand (Fig. 2A) are not important for activity. The Q386A mutant had one-third the activity of wild-type LigA (Fig. 3B); thus, the water-mediated contact from Gln Nϵ to the phosphodiester backbone (Fig. 2B) might contribute modestly, although not enough to meet our criterion of significance. In addition to this DNA contact, the Gln386 Oϵ engages in a hydrogen bond with the Arg379 side chain emanating from the neighboring β strand (not shown); loss of this contact might contribute to the activity decrement of the Q386A mutant. Gln386 is conserved as glutamine or glutamate in all of the bacterial LigA proteins but is replaced by tyrosine or isoleucine in the viral LigA clade (Fig. 2C). Eliminating Asn355 and its amide hydrogen bond to a phosphate on the template strand (Fig. 2A) reduced nick sealing to one-third the wild-type level (Fig. 3B). It is conceivable that the effects of the N355A change are modest because the same phosphate receives functionally redundant hydrogen bonds from the main-chain amides of Asn355 and its neighbor Ser354 (Fig. 2A). It is also possible that the 3-fold activity decrement of the N355A mutant reflects the loss of the hydrogen bond interaction with Arg342 in the neighboring strand of the β sheet (Fig. 2A), rather than loss of phosphate contacts. Arg342 itself participates in the same water-mediated phosphate contact as Gln330 Oϵ (Fig. 2A). The 5-fold decrement in nick sealing caused by the R342A change (Fig. 3B) better mimics the effects of N355A than Q330A, which implies that the role of Arg342 might be to stabilize the OB β sheet (via its contacts to Asn355 on one side and Glu328 on the other; Fig. 2A). The Arg342-Asn355 pair is confined to E. coli LigA (Fig. 2C); a similar Lys-Asn pair is present in Haemophilus influenzae LigA, but all other aligned LigA enzymes have diverse substitutions at the equivalent positions. Structure-Activity Relationships at Key Residues of the OB Domain—To refine the structure-function map of the OB domain, we introduced single-alanine changes at the essential Arg333-Thr334 dipeptide (Fig. 4A). The specific activities of R333A and T334A were 0.8 and 21% of wild-type LigA, respectively (Fig. 4B). Thus, Arg333 is essential by our criterion, but Thr334 is not. The Thr334Oγdonates a hydrogen bond to a nonbridging phosphate oxygen atom of the same phosphodiester coordinated by Arg333 (which engages the other nonbridging oxygen). The substantial residual activity of T334A could reflect functional redundancy of the missing Oγ hydrogen bond with the hydrogen bond donated to the same phosphate oxygen by the Thr334 main-chain amide (Fig. 2A). The essential Arg333 side chain was substituted conservatively by lysine and glutamine (Fig. 4A). The finding that lysine resulted in significant gain of activity (to 22% of wild type), whereas glutamine did not (0.8%), attests to the importance of positive charge and the ionic interactions with the phosphate backbone seen in the crystal structure (Fig. 2). The eukaryal viral LigA proteins naturally have lysine in place of the Arg333 side chain conserved among bacterial LigA proteins (Fig. 2C). The OB fold Arg379 residue defined as essential by the initial alanine scan was also replaced conservatively by lysine and glutamine (Fig. 4A). Although lysine afforded some recovery of function when compared with the R379A mutant (6.3% versus 0.7% of wild type, respectively), the R379K protein still satisfied our criterion for a significant mutational impairment. Glutamine (1.2% activity) had no salutary effect. We surmise that positive charge at position 379 does not suffice for nick sealing activity, which depends specifically on arginine, a residue that can form multidentate hydrogen bond contacts. Indeed, the crystal structure shows that Arg379 not only makes a water-mediated contact to adjacent nucleosides of the template strand (Figs. 1 and 2B), it donates hydrogen bonds from its terminal guanidinium nitrogens to main-chain carbonyls of Ala349 and Val383 (Fig. 2B). Ala349 is located at the tip of the hairpin turn linking two of the flanking β strands of the OB barrel that pack tightly against the DNA (Fig. 2B). We infer that Arg379 is needed to stabilize the OB fold in a proper conformation for productive DNA binding. Arg379 is conserved in bacterial LigA proteins but is replaced by lysine in the viral homologs (Fig. 2C). The essentiality of the Val383-Ile384 dipeptide was especially interesting given their location in the DNA minor groove (Fig. 2B). Val383 and Ile384 engage in an extensive network of van der Waals contacts with the nucleosides flanking the nick (illustrated in supplemental Fig. S1). Val383 abuts the C:G base pair at the 3′-OH nick terminus, making van der Waals contacts from Cγ1 to cytosine O2 (3.49 Å) and guanine N2 (3.61 Å) (supplemental Fig. S1). Ile384 stacks on the same guanine base so that the IleCδcontacts guanine N2 (3.67 Å) and C4 (3.67 Å). Ile384 also nestles against the 5′-terminal C:G base pair of the nick such that cytosine O2 is 3.28 Å from Ile384Cδand guanine N2 is proximal to Ile384Cδ(3.73 Å), Cγ1(3.8 Å), and Cγ2(3.92 Å). In addition, Ile384 packs against the penultimate nucleoside sugar of the 5′-PO4 nick strand, with van der Waals contacts from Ile384 Cγ1 to the deoxyribose O4 (3.06 Å) and C5 (3.94 Å) and from Ile384 Cβto the deoxyribose O4 (3.32 Å) and C4 (3.95 Å) (supplemental Fig. S1). The single-alanine mutants V383A and I384A (Fig. 4A) were both defective for nick sealing, with 4% of wild-type activity (Fig. 4B). The mutational effects at Val383 and Ile384 support their imputed role in deforming the local structure of the DNA duplex surrounding the nick (8Nandakumar J. Nair P.A. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 257-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The two base pairs flanking the nick on the 3′ side and the base pair at the nick 5′ terminus adopt an RNA-like A helical conformation. Also, the inclination and twist angles between adjacent base pairs exhibit an abrupt distortion at the nick termini, which results in bending and unwinding of the double helix and widening of the major groove surrounding the nick. The contacts of Val383 and Ile384 with the nucleosides in the minor groove at the nick were proposed to be a principal factor in splaying apart the bases (8Nandakumar J. Nair P.A. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 257-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The present mutational data suggest that this OB-induced distortion is a necessary component of the ligation pathway and are in accord with findings that Thermus LigA is sensitive to perturbations of the nick 3′-OH base pair in the minor groove (24Liu P. Burdzy A. Sowers L.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 4503-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Effects of Mutations at DNA-binding Residues of the LigA HhH Domain—The HhH domain of E. coli LigA anchors the phosphodiester backbone at four points that are arrayed symmetrically with respect to the nick (Fig. 5A). The LigA HhH domain consists of two tandem (HhH)2 modules, each composed of five α helices, arranged with pseudo two-fold symmetry in the LigA structure. The four-point binding of the HhH domain at the periphery of the LigA-DNA footprint stabilizes a 10° DNA bend centered at the nick. The functional DNA binding units of the E. coli LigA HhH domain are the four “loop-helix” motifs: 452DGMGDKI458, 487RMGPKS492, 519EVGEAT524, and 551DVGIVV556. Each binds to a NpNpN trinucleotide via a network of hydrogen bonds from backbone amide nitrogens to the phosphate oxygens of the NpNpN element. The proximal phosphate (5′-NpNpN) fits into an oxyanion hole formed by the amino acids at the N terminus of the α helix, which lacks a helix-capping side chain because each helix initiates with a conserved glycine (Gly455, Gly489, Gly521, or Gly553) that contributes to the oxyanion hole (Fig. 1). The adjacent phosphate (5′-NpNpN) receives a hydrogen bond from the backbone amide of a hydrophilic amino acid in the loop located two or three residues upstream of the conserved glycine. In E. coli LigA, these polar side chains (Asp452, Arg487, Glu519, or Asp551) straddle or penetrate into the DNA minor groove. In particular, Arg487 projects deeply into the minor groove, where it makes multiple direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonding contacts to the bases and the sugar atoms of both DNA strands (Fig. 1). To assess whether the oxyanion holes are functionally important, we introduced the aliphatic chains Ala and Val in lieu of Gly455, Gly489, Gly521, and Gly553. We also replaced the glycines with aspartates, thereby creating the potential for electrostatic repulsion between each of the HhH loop-helix motifs and the DNA phosphodiester backbone. The 12 Gly-to-Ala/Val/Asp mutants of LigA were purified (Fig. 3A) and then tested for nick sealing in parallel with wild-type LigA (Fig. 3B). In the 452DGMGDKI458 loop-helix motif that contacts the 3′-OH DNA strand (Fig. 1), changing Gly455 to alanine was well tolerated (44% activity), but nick sealing was suppressed 100-fold by valine or aspartate. Modeling a valine or aspartate side chain into the LigA-DNA crystal structure (without modifying the position of the polypeptide main chain) reveals a severe steric clash between the valine or aspartate side chain and the phosphate in the oxyanion hole (not shown). Although alanine would also impinge on the phosphate when modeled into the crystal structure (albeit less so than valine or aspartate), the biochemical data show that one extra methyl group can be accommodated without much effect on sealing, perhaps by a compensatory local adjustment in the main chain of the loop in the loop-helix motif. The 487RMGPKS492 motif contacts the template strand on the 3′-OH side of the nick (Fig. 1). We found that the G489A protein retained one-fourth of wild-type activity, whereas G489V and G489D had 3.2 and 0.8% of wild-type activity, respectively (Fig. 3B). The 551DVGIVV556 motif binds to the 5′-PO4 DNA strand (Fig. 1). Although G553A had 38% activity, G553V and G553D were reduced to 0.9 and 2.6% activity, respectively (Fig. 3B). The loop-helix motif 519EVGEAT524, which binds to the template DNA strand on the 5′-PO4 side of the nick (Fig. 1), was uniquely sensitive to alanine substitution at the glycine of the oxyanion hole. The G521A mutant was 50-fold less active than wild-type LigA, and the G521V and G521D proteins had <0.1% of wild-type function (Fig. 3B). Modeling the mutations into the LigA-DNA crystal structure indicated that the valine and aspartates clashed with the bound DNA in each of the oxyanion holes, as d"
