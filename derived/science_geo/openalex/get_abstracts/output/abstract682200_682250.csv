https://openalex.org/W3206303627,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations in major neutralizing antibody-binding sites can affect humoral immunity induced by infection or vaccination1–6. Here we analysed the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody and T cell responses in individuals who were previously infected (recovered) or uninfected (naive) and received mRNA vaccines to SARS-CoV-2. While individuals who were previously infected sustained higher antibody titres than individuals who were uninfected post-vaccination, the latter reached comparable levels of neutralization responses to the ancestral strain after the second vaccine dose. T cell activation markers measured upon spike or nucleocapsid peptide in vitro stimulation showed a progressive increase after vaccination. Comprehensive analysis of plasma neutralization using 16 authentic isolates of distinct locally circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants revealed a range of reduction in the neutralization capacity associated with specific mutations in the spike gene: lineages with E484K and N501Y/T (for example, B.1.351 and P.1) had the greatest reduction, followed by lineages with L452R (for example, B.1.617.2). While both groups retained neutralization capacity against all variants, plasma from individuals who were previously infected and vaccinated displayed overall better neutralization capacity than plasma from individuals who were uninfected and also received two vaccine doses, pointing to vaccine boosters as a relevant future strategy to alleviate the effect of emerging variants on antibody neutralizing activity. Immune analyses against circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants show that mRNA vaccination induces robust neutralizing antibodies and boosts cross-variant neutralizing antibodies elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection."

https://openalex.org/W3207880742,"Abstract Single-cell Hi-C (scHi-C) can identify cell-to-cell variability of three-dimensional (3D) chromatin organization, but the sparseness of measured interactions poses an analysis challenge. Here we report Higashi, an algorithm based on hypergraph representation learning that can incorporate the latent correlations among single cells to enhance overall imputation of contact maps. Higashi outperforms existing methods for embedding and imputation of scHi-C data and is able to identify multiscale 3D genome features in single cells, such as compartmentalization and TAD-like domain boundaries, allowing refined delineation of their cell-to-cell variability. Moreover, Higashi can incorporate epigenomic signals jointly profiled in the same cell into the hypergraph representation learning framework, as compared to separate analysis of two modalities, leading to improved embeddings for single-nucleus methyl-3C data. In an scHi-C dataset from human prefrontal cortex, Higashi identifies connections between 3D genome features and cell-type-specific gene regulation. Higashi can also potentially be extended to analyze single-cell multiway chromatin interactions and other multimodal single-cell omics data."
https://openalex.org/W3206184033,"Recent efforts have succeeded in surveying open chromatin at the single-cell level, but high-throughput, single-cell assessment of heterochromatin and its underlying genomic determinants remains challenging. We engineered a hybrid transposase including the chromodomain (CD) of the heterochromatin protein-1α (HP-1α), which is involved in heterochromatin assembly and maintenance through its binding to trimethylation of the lysine 9 on histone 3 (H3K9me3), and developed a single-cell method, single-cell genome and epigenome by transposases sequencing (scGET-seq), that, unlike single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (scATAC-seq), comprehensively probes both open and closed chromatin and concomitantly records the underlying genomic sequences. We tested scGET-seq in cancer-derived organoids and human-derived xenograft (PDX) models and identified genetic events and plasticity-driven mechanisms contributing to cancer drug resistance. Next, building upon the differential enrichment of closed and open chromatin, we devised a method, Chromatin Velocity, that identifies the trajectories of epigenetic modifications at the single-cell level. Chromatin Velocity uncovered paths of epigenetic reorganization during stem cell reprogramming and identified key transcription factors driving these developmental processes. scGET-seq reveals the dynamics of genomic and epigenetic landscapes underlying any cellular processes."
https://openalex.org/W3205609245,"Initiation of cyst formation in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) occurs when kidney tubule cells are rendered null for either PKD1 or PKD2 by somatic ‘second hit’ mutations. Subsequent cyst progression remodels the organ through changes in tubule cell shape, proliferation and secretion. The kidney develops inflammation and fibrosis. We constructed a mouse model in which adult inactivation of either Pkd gene can be followed by reactivation of the gene at a later time. Using this model, we show that re-expression of Pkd genes in cystic kidneys results in rapid reversal of ADPKD. Cyst cell proliferation is reduced, autophagy is activated and cystic tubules with expanded lumina lined by squamoid cells revert to normal lumina lined by cuboidal cells. Increases in inflammation, extracellular matrix deposition and myofibroblast activation are reversed, and the kidneys become smaller. We conclude that phenotypic features of ADPKD are reversible and that the kidney has an unexpected capacity for plasticity controlled at least in part by ADPKD gene function. Re-expression of Pkd genes in cystic kidneys results in rapid reversal of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease phenotypes in mice, revealing an unexpected capacity for renal plasticity under the control of Pkd gene function."
https://openalex.org/W3204990993,"In the absence of widespread vaccination for COVID-19, governments and public health officials have advocated for the public to wear masks during the pandemic. The decision to wear a mask in public is likely affected by both beliefs about its efficacy and the prevalence of the behavior. Greater mask use in the community may encourage others to follow this norm, but it also creates an incentive for individuals to free ride on the protection afforded to them by others. We report the results of two vignette-based experiments conducted in the United States (n = 3,100) and Italy (n = 2,659) to examine the causal relationship between beliefs, social norms, and reported intentions to engage in mask promoting behavior. In both countries, survey respondents were quota sampled to be representative of the country's population on key demographics. We find that providing information about how masks protect others increases the likelihood that someone would wear a mask or encourage others to do so in the United States, but not in Italy. There is no effect of providing information about how masks protect the wearer in either country. Additionally, greater mask use increases intentions to wear a mask and encourage someone else to wear theirs properly in both the United States and Italy. Thus, community mask use may be self-reinforcing."
https://openalex.org/W3205917831,"Since their emergence, SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 have spread worldwide. We estimated the risk of hospitalisation and admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) for infections with B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 in Norway, compared to infections with non-VOC.Using linked individual-level data from national registries, we conducted a cohort study on laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Norway diagnosed between 28 December 2020 and 2 May 2021. Variants were identified based on whole genome sequencing, partial sequencing by Sanger sequencing or PCR screening for selected targets. The outcome was hospitalisation or ICU admission. We calculated adjusted risk ratios (aRR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using multivariable binomial regression to examine the association between SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 with i) hospital admission and ii) ICU admission compared to non-VOC.We included 23,169 cases of B.1.1.7, 548 B.1.351 and 4,584 non-VOC. Overall, 1,017 cases were hospitalised (3.6%) and 206 admitted to ICU (0.7%). B.1.1.7 was associated with a 1.9-fold increased risk of hospitalisation (aRR 95%CI 1.6-2.3) and a 1.8-fold increased risk of ICU admission (aRR 95%CI 1.2-2.8) compared to non-VOC. Among hospitalised cases, no difference was found in the risk of ICU admission between B.1.1.7 and non-VOC. B.1.351 was associated with a 2.4-fold increased risk of hospitalisation (aRR 95%CI 1.7-3.3) and a 2.7-fold increased risk of ICU admission (aRR 95%CI 1.2-6.5) compared to non-VOC.Our findings add to the growing evidence of a higher risk of severe disease among persons infected with B.1.1.7 or B.1.351. This highlights the importance of prevention and control measures to reduce transmission of these VOC in society, particularly ongoing vaccination programmes, and preparedness plans for hospital surge capacity."

https://openalex.org/W3207470445,"In recent years, advancements in Internet and cloud technologies have led to a significant increase in electronic trading in which consumers make online purchases and transactions. This growth leads to unauthorized access to users' sensitive information and damages the resources of an enterprise. Phishing is one of the familiar attacks that trick users to access malicious content and gain their information. In terms of website interface and uniform resource locator (URL), most phishing webpages look identical to the actual webpages. Various strategies for detecting phishing websites, such as blacklist, heuristic, Etc., have been suggested. However, due to inefficient security technologies, there is an exponential increase in the number of victims. The anonymous and uncontrollable framework of the Internet is more vulnerable to phishing attacks. Existing research works show that the performance of the phishing detection system is limited. There is a demand for an intelligent technique to protect users from the cyber-attacks. In this study, the author proposed a URL detection technique based on machine learning approaches. A recurrent neural network method is employed to detect phishing URL. Researcher evaluated the proposed method with 7900 malicious and 5800 legitimate sites, respectively. The experiments' outcome shows that the proposed method's performance is better than the recent approaches in malicious URL detection."
https://openalex.org/W3207409006,"In France, social distancing measures have been adopted to contain the spread of COVID-19, culminating in national Lockdowns. The use of hand washing, hydro-alcoholic rubs and mask-wearing also increased over time. As these measures are likely to impact the transmission of many communicable diseases, we studied the changes in common infectious diseases incidence in France during the first year of COVID-19 circulation. We examined the weekly incidence of acute gastroenteritis, chickenpox, acute respiratory infections and bronchiolitis reported in general practitioner networks since January 2016. We obtained search engine query volume for French terms related to these diseases and sales data for relevant drugs over the same period. A periodic regression model was fit to disease incidence, drug sales and search query volume before the COVID-19 period and extrapolated afterwards. We compared the expected values with observations made in 2020. During the first lockdown period, incidence dropped by 67% for gastroenteritis, by 79% for bronchiolitis, by 49% for acute respiratory infection and 90% for chickenpox compared to the past years. Reductions with respect to the expected incidence reflected the strength of implemented measures. Incidence in children was impacted the most. Reduction in primary care consultations dropped during a short period at the beginning of the first lockdown period but remained more than 95% of the expected value afterwards. In primary care, the large decrease in reported gastroenteritis, chickenpox or bronchiolitis observed during the period where many barrier measures were implemented imply that the circulation of common viruses was reduced and informs on the overall effect of these measures."
https://openalex.org/W3206710376,"Emergence of acquired resistance to osimertinib (AZD9291), the first-approved third-generation EGFR inhibitor that selectively and irreversibly inhibits the activating EGFR mutations and the resistant T790M mutation, is a giant and urgent clinical challenge. Fully understanding the biology underlying the response of EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to osimertinib is the foundation for development of mechanism-driven strategies to overcome acquired resistance to osimertinib or other third-generation EGFR inhibitors. This study focused on tackling this important issue by elucidating the critical role of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) degradation in conferring the response of EGFR mutant NSCLC cells to osimertinib and by validating the strategy via directly targeting SREBP1 for overcoming osimertinib acquired resistance. Osimertinib facilitated degradation of the mature form of SREBP1 (mSREBP1) in a GSK3/FBXW7-dependent manner and reduced protein levels of its regulated genes in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells/tumors accompanied with suppression of lipogenesis. Once resistant, EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell lines possessed elevated levels of mSREBP1, which were resistant to osimertinib modulation. Both genetic and pharmacological inhibition of SREBP1 sensitized osimertinib-resistant cells and tumors to osimertinib primarily through enhancing Bim-dependent induction of apoptosis, whereas enforced expression of ectopic SREBP1 in sensitive EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells compromised osimertinib's cell-killing effects. Collectively, we have demonstrated a novel connection between osimertinib and SREBP1 degradation and its impact on the response of EGFR mutant NSCLC cells to osimertinib and suggested an effective strategy for overcoming acquired resistance to osimertinib, and possibly other EGFR inhibitors, via targeting SREBP1."
https://openalex.org/W3206830784,"Live cell imaging with high spatiotemporal resolution and high detection sensitivity facilitates the study of the dynamics of cellular structure and function. However, extracting high-resolution 4D (3D space plus time) information from live cells remains challenging, because current methods are slow, require high peak excitation intensities or suffer from high out-of-focus background. Here we present 3D interferometric lattice light-sheet (3D-iLLS) imaging, a technique that requires low excitation light levels and provides high background suppression and substantially improved volumetric resolution by combining 4Pi interferometry with selective plane illumination. We demonstrate that 3D-iLLS has an axial resolution and single-particle localization precision of 100 nm (FWHM) and <10 nm (1σ), respectively. We illustrate the performance of 3D-iLLS in a range of systems: single messenger RNA molecules, nanoscale assemblies of transcription regulators in the nucleus, the microtubule cytoskeleton and mitochondria organelles. The enhanced 4D resolution and increased signal-to-noise ratio of 3D-iLLS will facilitate the analysis of biological processes at the sub-cellular level. New lattice light-sheet microscopy approach improves live cell imaging."
https://openalex.org/W3206921567,"An. funestus is a major Afrotropical vector of human malaria. This study sought to investigate the larval ecology, sporozoite infection rates and blood meal sources of An. funestus in western Kenya.Larval surveys were carried out in Bungoma (Highland) and Kombewa (lowland) of western Kenya. Aquatic habitats were identified, characterized, georeferenced and carefully examined for mosquito larvae and predators. Indoor resting mosquitoes were sampled using pyrethrum spray catches. Adults and larvae were morphologically and molecularly identified to species. Sporozoite infections and blood meal sources were detected using real-time PCR and ELISA respectively.Of the 151 aquatic habitats assessed, 62/80 (78%) in Bungoma and 58/71(82%) in Kombewa were positive for mosquito larvae. Of the 3,193 larvae sampled, An. funestus larvae constitute 38% (1224/3193). Bungoma recorded a higher number of An. funestus larvae (85%, 95%, CI, 8.722-17.15) than Kombewa (15%, 95%, CI, 1.33-3.91). Molecular identification of larvae showed that 89% (n = 80) were An. funestus. Approximately 59%, 35% and 5% of An. funestus larvae co-existed with An. gambiae s.l, Culex spp and An. coustani in the same habitats respectively. Of 1,221 An. funestus s.l adults sampled, molecular identifications revealed that An. funestus constituted 87% (n = 201) and 88% (n = 179) in Bungoma and Kombewa, respectively. The Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite rate of An. funestus in Bungoma and Kombewa was 2% (3/174) and 1% (2/157), respectively, and the human blood index of An. funestus was 84% (48/57) and 89% (39/44) and for Bungoma and Kombewa, respectively.Man-made ponds had the highest abundance of An. funestus larvae. Multiple regression and principal component analyses identified the distance to the nearest house as the key environmental factor associated with the abundance of An. funestus larvae in aquatic habitats. This study serves as a guide for the control of An. funestus and other mosquito species to complement existing vector control strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3204283060,"Scribble, a member of the LAP protein family, contributes to the apicobasal polarity (ABP) of epithelial cells. The LAP-unique region of these proteins, which is essential and sufficient for ABP, includes a conserved Leucine-Rich Repeat (LRR) domain. The major binding partners of this region that could regulate ABP remain unknown. Here, using proteomics, native gel electrophoresis, and site-directed mutagenesis, we show that the concave surface of LRR domain in Scribble participates in three types of mutually exclusive interactions-(i) homodimerization, serving as an auto-inhibitory mechanism; (ii) interactions with a diverse set of polarity proteins, such as Llgl1, Llgl2, EPB41L2, and EPB41L5, which produce distinct multiprotein complexes; and (iii) a direct interaction with the protein phosphatase, PP1. Analogy with the complex between PP1 and LRR domain of SDS22, a well-studied PP1 regulator, suggests that the Scibble-PP1 complex stores a latent form of PP1 in the basolateral cell cortex. Such organization may generate a dynamic signaling network wherein PP1 could be dispatched from the complex with Scribble to particular protein ligands, achieving fast dephosphorylation kinetics."
https://openalex.org/W3207173961,"In this paper, a new mathematical model is formulated that describes the interaction between uninfected cells, infected cells, viruses, intracellular viral RNA, Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs), and antibodies. Hence, the model contains certain biological relations that are thought to be key factors driving this interaction which allow us to obtain precise logical conclusions. Therefore, it improves our perception, that would otherwise not be possible, to comprehend the pathogenesis, to interpret clinical data, to control treatment, and to suggest new relations. This model can be used to study viral dynamics in patients for a wide range of infectious diseases like HIV, HPV, HBV, HCV, and Covid-19. Though, analysis of a new multiscale HCV model incorporating the immune system response is considered in detail, the analysis and results can be applied for all other viruses. The model utilizes a transformed multiscale model in the form of ordinary differential equations (ODE) and incorporates into it the interaction of the immune system. The role of CTLs and the role of antibody responses are investigated. The positivity of the solutions is proven, the basic reproduction number is obtained, and the equilibrium points are specified. The stability at the equilibrium points is analyzed based on the Lyapunov invariance principle. By using appropriate Lyapunov functions, the uninfected equilibrium point is proven to be globally asymptotically stable when the reproduction number is less than one and unstable otherwise. Global stability of the infected equilibrium points is considered, and it has been found that each equilibrium point has a specific domain of stability. Stability regions could be overlapped and a bistable equilibria could be found, which means the coexistence of two stable equilibrium points. Hence, the solution converges to one of them depending on the initial conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3207924166,"Medical treatment using non-thermal atmospheric pressure plasma (NTAPP) is rapidly gaining recognition. NTAPP is thought to be a new therapeutic method because it could generate highly reactive species in an ambient atmosphere which could be exposed to biological targets (e.g., cells and tissues). If plasma-generated reactive species could stimulate bone regeneration, NTAPP can provide a new treatment opportunity in regenerative medicine. Here, we investigated the impact of NTAPP on bone regeneration using a large bone defect in New Zealand White rabbits and a simple atmospheric pressure plasma (helium microplasma jet). We observed the recovery progress of the large bone defects by X-ray imaging over eight weeks after surgery. The X-ray results showed a clear difference in the occupancy of the new bone of the large bone defect among groups with different plasma treatment times, whereas the new bone occupancy was not substantial in the untreated control group. According to the results of micro-computed tomography analysis at eight weeks, the most successful bone regeneration was achieved using a plasma treatment time of 10 min, wherein the new bone volume was 1.51 times larger than that in the plasma untreated control group. Using H&E and Masson trichrome stains, nucleated cells were uniformly observed, and no inclusion was confirmed, respectively, in the groups of plasma treatment. We concluded the critical large bone defect were filled with new bone. Overall, these results suggest that NTAPP is promising for fracture treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3205146997,"Many wearables allow physiological data acquisition in sleep and enable clinicians to assess sleep outside of sleep labs. Belun Sleep Platform (BSP) is a novel neural network-based home sleep apnea testing system utilizing a wearable ring device to detect obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The objective of the study is to assess the performance of BSP for the evaluation of OSA. Subjects who take heart rate-affecting medications and those with non-arrhythmic comorbidities were included in this cohort. Polysomnography (PSG) studies were performed simultaneously with the Belun Ring in individuals who were referred to the sleep lab for an overnight sleep study. The sleep studies were manually scored using the American Academy of Sleep Medicine Scoring Manual (version 2.4) with 4% desaturation hypopnea criteria. A total of 78 subjects were recruited. Of these, 45% had AHI &lt; 5; 18% had AHI 5–15; 19% had AHI 15–30; 18% had AHI ≥ 30. The Belun apnea-hypopnea index (bAHI) correlated well with the PSG-AHI ( r = 0.888, P &lt; 0.001). The Belun total sleep time (bTST) and PSG-TST had a high correlation coefficient ( r = 0.967, P &lt; 0.001). The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity in categorizing AHI ≥ 15 were 0.808 [95% CI, 0.703–0.888], 0.931 [95% CI, 0.772–0.992], and 0.735 [95% CI, 0.589–0.850], respectively. The use of beta-blocker/calcium-receptor antagonist and the presence of comorbidities did not negatively affect the sensitivity and specificity of BSP in predicting OSA. A diagnostic algorithm combining STOP-Bang cutoff of 5 and bAHI cutoff of 15 events/h demonstrated an accuracy, sensitivity, specificity of 0.938 [95% CI, 0.828–0.987], 0.944 [95% CI, 0.727–0.999], and 0.933 [95% CI, 0.779–0.992], respectively, for the diagnosis of moderate to severe OSA.

https://openalex.org/W3206454950,"Data on the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in Enterobacteriaceae in African wildlife are still relatively limited. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of phenotypic intrinsic and acquired antimicrobial resistance of enterobacteria from several species of terrestrial wild mammals in national parks of Gabon. Colony culture and isolation were done using MacConkey agar. Isolates were identified using the VITEK 2 and MALDI-TOF methods. Antibiotic susceptibility was analysed and interpreted according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing guidelines. The preliminary test for ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae was performed by replicating enterobacterial colonies on MacConkey agar supplemented with 2 mg/L cefotaxime (MCA+CTX). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production was confirmed with the double-disc synergy test (DDST). The inhibition zone diameters were read with SirScan. Among the 130 bacterial colonies isolated from 125 fecal samples, 90 enterobacterial isolates were identified. Escherichia coli (61%) was the most prevalent, followed by Enterobacter cloacae (8%), Proteus mirabilis (8%), Klebsiella variicola (7%), Klebsiella aerogenes (7%), Klebsiella oxytoca (4%), Citrobacter freundii (3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1%) and Serratia marcescens (1%). Acquired resistance was carried by E. coli (11% of all E. coli isolates) and E. cloacae (3% of all E. cloacae) isolates, while intrinsic resistance was detected in all the other resistant isolates (n = 31); K. variicola, K. oxytoca, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, K. aerogenes, S. marcescens and P. mirabilis). Our data show that most strains isolated in protected areas in Gabon are wild type isolates and carry intrinsic resistance rather than acquired resistance."

In this study, de novo annotation carried out using REPET pipeline showed that TEs occupy approximately 16% of the genome and are represented by 1038 lineages. Class II elements were the most frequent and most TEs were inactive due to the deletions they have accumulated. The analyses of TEs ages revealed a first burst at 20% of divergence from present that mobilized many TE families including mostly Tc1/mariner and Gypsy superfamilies and a second burst at 2% of divergence, which involved mainly the class II elements suggesting new TEs invasions. Additionally, 86 TEs insertions involving recently transposed elements were identified. Among them, several MITEs and Gypsy retrotransposons were inserted in the vicinity of SSGP and chemosensory genes. The findings represent a valuable resource for more in-depth investigation of the TE impact onto M. destructor genome and their possible influence on the expression of the virulence and chemosensory genes and consequently the behavior of this pest towards its host plants."
https://openalex.org/W3201885634,"Golgi-resident bisphosphate nucleotidase 2 (BPNT2) is a member of a family of magnesium-dependent, lithium-inhibited phosphatases that share a three-dimensional structural motif that directly coordinates metal binding to effect phosphate hydrolysis. BPNT2 catalyzes the breakdown of 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphate, a by-product of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) sulfation. KO of BPNT2 in mice leads to skeletal abnormalities because of impaired GAG sulfation, especially chondroitin-4-sulfation, which is critical for proper extracellular matrix development. Mutations in BPNT2 have also been found to underlie a chondrodysplastic disorder in humans. The precise mechanism by which the loss of BPNT2 impairs sulfation remains unclear. Here, we used mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to test the hypothesis that the catalytic activity of BPNT2 is required for GAG sulfation in vitro. We show that a catalytic-dead Bpnt2 construct (D108A) does not rescue impairments in intracellular or secreted sulfated GAGs, including decreased chondroitin-4-sulfate, present in Bpnt2-KO MEFs. We also demonstrate that missense mutations in Bpnt2 adjacent to the catalytic site, which are known to cause chondrodysplasia in humans, recapitulate defects in overall GAG sulfation and chondroitin-4-sulfation in MEF cultures. We further show that treatment of MEFs with lithium (a common psychotropic medication) inhibits GAG sulfation and that this effect depends on the presence of BPNT2. Taken together, this work demonstrates that the catalytic activity of an enzyme potently inhibited by lithium can modulate GAG sulfation and therefore extracellular matrix composition, revealing new insights into lithium pharmacology."
https://openalex.org/W3204208974,"Metabolic dysfunction is a major driver of tumorigenesis. The serine/threonine kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) constitutes a key central regulator of metabolic pathways promoting cancer cell proliferation and survival. mTOR activity is regulated by metabolic sensors as well as by numerous factors comprising the phosphatase and tensin homolog/PI3K/AKT canonical pathway, which are often mutated in cancer. However, some cancers displaying constitutively active mTOR do not carry alterations within this canonical pathway, suggesting alternative modes of mTOR regulation. Since DEPTOR, an endogenous inhibitor of mTOR, was previously found to modulate both mTOR complexes 1 and 2, we investigated the different post-translational modification that could affect its inhibitory function. We found that tyrosine (Tyr) 289 phosphorylation of DEPTOR impairs its interaction with mTOR, leading to increased mTOR activation. Using proximity biotinylation assays, we identified SYK (spleen tyrosine kinase) as a kinase involved in DEPTOR Tyr 289 phosphorylation in an ephrin (erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular carcinoma) receptor–dependent manner.

These exclusive components confer each complex with specific activities, such as cell proliferation and autophagy for mTORC1, and cell survival and cytoskeletal rearrangement for mTORC2 (13Laplante M. Sabatini D.M. mTOR signaling in growth control and disease.Cell. 2012; 149: 274-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5873) Google Scholar). mTOR functions as a central metabolic regulator involved in the modulation of cellular processes, such as autophagy, macromolecule biosynthesis, lysosome biogenesis, cell mobility, cell survival, and cytoskeletal rearrangement (14Liu G.Y. Sabatini D.M. mTOR at the nexus of nutrition, growth, ageing and disease.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2020; 21: 183-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). The involvement of mTOR in these diverse cellular processes is regulated by a vast array of cellular contexts, including hypoxia, inflammation, energetic variation, growth factor stimulation, and nutrient availability. Because of its biological versatility, it is not surprising to observe altered mTOR activation in many cellular dysfunctions and diseases (13Laplante M. Sabatini D.M. mTOR signaling in growth control and disease.Cell. 2012; 149: 274-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5873) Google Scholar). Thus, mTOR has to be tightly regulated to maintain cellular homeostasis, a function performed by the DEP domain–containing mTOR-interacting protein (DEPTOR), an endogenous mTORC1 and mTORC2 inhibitor (12Peterson T.R.

However, some cancers are not carrying mutations within this pathway but still harbor constitutive activation of mTOR (17Xie X. Hu H. Tong X. Li L. Liu X. Chen M. Yuan H. Xie X. Li Q. Zhang Y.

This is the case with approximately 85% of low-grade glioma that are associated with isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 or 2 mutations (19Yan H. Parsons D.W. Jin G. McLendon R. Rasheed B.A. Yuan W. Kos I.

Because of their molecular similarity, R-2HG can inhibit the catalytic activities of numerous α-ketoglutarate-dependent enzymes (22M.Gagne L. Boulay K. Topisirovic I. Huot M.E. Mallette F.A.

R-2HG-induced DEPTOR degradation leads to constitutive mTORC1 and mTORC2 activation in a PTEN/PI3K/AKT-independent manner (23Carbonneau M. L M.G. Lalonde M.E. Germain M.A. Motorina A. Guiot M.C.

Commun. 2016; 7: 12700Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Moreover, many post-translational modifications (PTMs) were identified to affect DEPTOR inhibitory activity on mTOR. For example, DEPTOR was shown to be serine phosphorylated (Ser286/287/291/293/299) by mTOR and CK1α under growth factor stimulation, leading to its degradation by the ubiquitin/proteasome system (24Duan S.

While it is clear that DEPTOR degradation can affect mTOR-associated biological processes and pathology, the precise mechanisms underlying DEPTOR endogenous modulation allowing the fine-tuning of mTOR activity remained unexplored. Erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular carcinoma (EPH) receptors are the largest family of receptor protein tyrosine kinase. They are involved in a vast variety of cellular processes, such as proliferation, differentiation, cell shape, and mobility (27Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Cell signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases.Cell. 2010; 141: 1117-1134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2944) Google Scholar). Their dysregulation is often associated with cancers and developmental disorders (28Pasquale E.B. Eph receptors and ephrins in cancer: Bidirectional signalling and beyond.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2010; 10: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). The EPH receptors are divided in either type A subgroup that contains receptors EPHA1–A8 and EPHA10, or the type B subgroup, comprising receptors EPHB1–B4 and EPHB6. Aside from the pseudokinases EPHA10 and EPHB6, all EPH receptors display catalytic activity (29Dai D. Huang Q. Nussinov R. Ma B. Promiscuous and specific recognition among ephrins and Eph receptors.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1844: 1729-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 30Lisabeth E.M. Falivelli G. Pasquale E.B. Eph receptor signaling and ephrins.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5a009159Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Their ligands are ephrins, which are also divided into subclasses A and B, based on their membrane attachment. Ephrins A are anchored by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage, whereas ephrins B have a transmembrane domain and a C-terminal PDZ domain (31Nikolov D.B. Xu K. Himanen J.P. Eph/ephrin recognition and the role of Eph/ephrin clusters in signaling initiation.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1834: 2160-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). While some degree of crosstalk is documented, EPHA receptors bind preferentially to ephrins A and EPHB receptors to ephrins B (32Pasquale E.B. Eph-ephrin promiscuity is now crystal clear.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 417-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). EPH receptor activation is mainly triggered by cell–cell contact or by an extracellular signaling from neighboring cells. The complexity of EPH receptor–ephrin signaling results in a vast variety of functions and regulation. For this reason, dysregulation of the expression of EPH receptors is often associated with cancer (33Murai K.K. Pasquale E.B. 'Eph'ective signaling: Forward, reverse and crosstalk.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2823-2832Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 34Bruckner K. Pasquale E.B. Klein R. Tyrosine phosphorylation of transmembrane ligands for Eph receptors.Science. 1997; 275: 1640-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). We identified a novel phosphorylation event targeting DEPTOR tyrosine (Tyr) 289, which rapidly affects its inhibitory function on both mTORC1 and mTORC2. Phosphorylation of DEPTOR on Tyr 289 weakens its association with mTOR, thus allowing a rapid and sustained activation of both mTORC1 and mTORC2. Proximity biotinylation experiments identified SYK (spleen tyrosine kinase) as a kinase implicated on DEPTOR Tyr phosphorylation. Using combinatory methods, we found that the EPHB2 receptor signaling pathway also promotes DEPTOR Tyr 289 phosphorylation through SYK activation. Taken together, our findings identified a novel molecular mechanism involved in modulating mTOR activity and a previously unidentified potential pathway contributing to PTEN/PI3K/AKT-independent increase of mTOR activity observed in a subset of cancers. Increasing evidence is pointing toward multiple PTMs playing a disruptive role on DEPTOR function as an endogenous inhibitor of mTOR. While serine phosphorylation was shown to trigger DEPTOR proteasomal degradation (12Peterson T.R. Laplante M. Thoreen C.C. Sancak Y. Kang S.A. Kuehl W.M. Gray N.S. Sabatini D.M.

Cell. 2011; 44: 290-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), no PTM has been identified as a reversible molecular switch to modulate DEPTOR functions and in turn rapidly activate/inhibit mTORC1 and mTORC2. We hypothesized that DEPTOR is Tyr phosphorylated following growth factor stimulation and that this regulates DEPTOR stability and/or activity. We first used a phospho-Tyr-specific antibody (4G10) on denatured DEPTOR immunoprecipitate extract and were able to detect a Tyr phosphorylation event on DEPTOR (Fig. 1A). Since Tyr phosphorylation is known to modulate protein interactions and activity in a rapid and reversible manner (35Ardito F. Giuliani M. Perrone D. Troiano G. Lo Muzio L. The crucial role of protein phosphorylation in cell signaling and its use as targeted therapy (review).Int. J. Mol. Med. 2017; 40: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), we sought to map DEPTOR residue(s) undergoing Tyr phosphorylation. To do this, we assessed if Tyr phosphorylation was restricted to a specific portion of DEPTOR. Using different fragments of DEPTOR (Fig. 1B), we found Tyr phosphorylation on the C-terminal half of the protein (amino acids 214–409) (Fig. 1C). We further divided the C-terminal fragment in two smaller fragments (D3 and D4 fragments) and found that Tyr phosphorylation was restricted to the D4 fragment (amino acids 276–409) (Fig. 1D). We observed multiple bands above the major band for DEPTOR C-terminal and DEPTOR D4 fragment (Fig. 1, C and D). For both of them, the upper band seems to be the one harboring most of the Tyr phosphorylation. We then investigated the nature of this bands pattern by using a DEPTOR D4 fragment tagged on both its N terminus (FLAG) and C terminus (hemagglutinin [HA]). Detection of both bands of DEPTOR fragment D4 using FLAG and HA antibodies suggested that these forms of DEPTOR are not resulting from proteolytic cleavage but rather resulting of PTMs (Fig. S1A). Only the higher molecular weight band of DEPTOR fragment D4 was Tyr phosphorylated and recognized using 4G10 antibody (Fig. S1B). In addition, we validated that the ∼18 kDa band was not solely the result of DEPTOR Tyr phosphorylation, since it was still observable using anti-FLAG in Tyr phosphatase-treated immunoprecipitates (Fig. S1B). Sequence alignment revealed that three tyrosines are present within D4 fragment and that only two are evolutionarily conserved, namely Tyr 289 and Tyr 326 (Fig. S1C). By generating point mutation of each conserved tyrosine within the D4 fragment into nonphosphorylatable phenylalanine (Y to F), we determined that only Tyr 289 can be phosphorylated (Fig. 1E). DEPTOR association to mTOR is mediated by their respective PDZ (DEPTOR) and FAT (mTOR) domain (12Peterson T.R. Laplante M. Thoreen C.C. Sancak Y. Kang S.A. Kuehl W.M. Gray N.S. Sabatini D.M. DEPTOR is an mTOR inhibitor frequently overexpressed in multiple myeloma cells and required for their survival.Cell. 2009; 137: 873-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). We investigated whether phosphorylation on Tyr 289, which is within the PDZ domain, could be involved in modulating DEPTOR ability to bind mTOR. The dynamics of the DEPTOR–mTOR association are regulated through energy levels within the cell, as a low energy level favors tight binding between DEPTOR and mTOR, while high nutrient availability promotes their dissociation (24Duan S. Skaar J.R. Kuchay S. Toschi A. Kanarek N. Ben-Neriah Y. Pagano M. mTOR generates an auto-amplification loop by triggering the betaTrCP- and CK1alpha-dependent degradation of DEPTOR.Mol.

Cell. 2011; 44: 290-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). To assess the impact of Tyr 289 phosphorylation on DEPTOR binding to mTOR, we starved cells prior to serum stimulation and then performed DEPTOR immunoprecipitation (IP). Endogenous DEPTOR was first depleted from HeLa cells using validated DEPTOR shRNAs targeting the 3′UTR of DEPTOR (Fig. S2A). We then infected these cells with shRNA-resistant WT DEPTOR or mutants harboring Tyr 289 phosphomimetic Y to E substitution (DEPTORY289E) or a nonphosphorylatable Y to F substitution (DEPTORY289F). In starved cells, nonphosphorylatable DEPTORY289F showed increased association to mTOR when compared with DEPTORWT, whereas the phosphomimetic version of DEPTOR (DEPTORY289E) showed a slight decreased binding when compared with DEPTORWT (Fig. 2). This difference in association of DEPTORY289E was even more noticeable following growth factor stimulation, while both DEPTORWT and DEPTORY289F showed similar association to mTOR (Fig. 2). These results suggest that Tyr 289 phosphorylation negatively modulates DEPTOR ability to bind mTOR in serum-starved and serum-stimulated conditions. Thus, by modulating DEPTOR–mTOR association, DEPTOR phosphorylation on Y289 might then promote mTOR activation. Growth factor–induced DEPTOR dissociation from mTOR was shown to positively modulate mTOR activity (24Duan S. Skaar J.R. Kuchay S. Toschi A. Kanarek N. Ben-Neriah Y.

Cell. 2011; 44: 290-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). To determine whether DEPTOR Tyr phosphorylation impacts mTOR activity, we investigated the repressive function of DEPTOR phosphorylation mutant on mTORC1 (phospho-S6S240/244) and mTORC2 (phospho-AKTS473) activation. To monitor the regulation of mTOR activity, cells were first serum starved for 16 h, then stimulated with complete media for 30 min, and then replaced with starving media for 12 h in order to follow kinetics of the regulation of mTOR activity. We observed a faster decrease in phosphorylation of S6 in DEPTORY289F-expressing cells, compared with cells expressing DEPTORWT, whereas those expressing DEPTORY289E showed a sustained mTORC1 activation until 4 h poststimulation (Fig. 3A), suggesting that phosphorylation on Tyr 289 impairs DEPTOR ability to suppress mTORC1 activity. All DEPTOR mutants showed similar behavior regarding phospho-AKTS473, a readout for mTORC2 activation, after serum stimulation, followed by rapid decrease of phosphorylated AKT within the first hour (Fig. 3A). Because of the faster regulation of mTORC2 following stimulation, phospho-AKTS473 levels in mutant DEPTOR-expressing cells was rather determined within the first hour after serum stimulation. Like mTORC1 activity, cells expressing DEPTORY289F mutant showed a faster decrease of phospho-AKTS473 compared with cells expressing DEPTORWT, whereas DEPTORY289E-expressing cells displayed sustained mTORC2 activation following serum removal (Fig. 3B). These results confirmed that DEPTOR phosphorylation on Tyr 289 decreases its inhibitory functions on mTOR activity. To further investigate the cellular impact of DEPTOR Tyr 289 phosphorylation on mTOR-dependent mechanisms, we assessed its effect on cytoskeletal reorganization by measuring cell size area upon stimulation. We measured cell size area of HeLa cells depleted of endogenous DEPTOR expressing DEPTORWT, DEPTORY289F, or DEPTORY289E at different time points for 18 h after growth factor stimulation (Fig. 4A). Cell area rapidly increased 1 to 3 h following stimulation and reached maximum size at 12 h poststimulation. The increase in cell area was even more noticeable in cells expressing DEPTORY289E comparatively to cells expressing either DEPTORWT or nonphosphorylatable DEPTORY289F (Fig. 4A). These results are consistent with our assessment of mTORC1 and mTORC2 activation (Fig. 3). Moreover, DEPTORY289F was found to be more potent than DEPTORWT to repress mTOR activity, suggesting that the phosphorylation status of Tyr 289 could directly affect the ability of DEPTOR to bind and repress activated mTOR. To confirm the specific involvement of mTORC2 in this process, we compared the effect of rapamycin (inhibitor of mTORC1) and Torin 1 (inhibitor of both mTOR complexes) on growth factor–induced cytoskeletal modulation of cells expressing DEPTORY289E. We observed a significant decrease in cell area upon treatment with Torin 1. When only mTORC1 was inhibited, the decrease in cell area was less marked, confirming the impact of mTORC2 on cell area (Fig. 4B). These results confirm that DEPTOR phosphorylation on Tyr 289 sustained mTORC2 activity leading to increased cytoskeletal reorganization. Ubiquitin-mediated degradation of DEPTOR is an important molecular process allowing the release of mTOR from DEPTOR-mediated inhibition (24Duan S. Skaar J.R. Kuchay S. Toschi A. Kanarek N.

Interrupted time-series analysis showed sudden increase and up-trending improvement in interpreter use, and a corresponding decrease in self-discharge rates, during a 12-month intervention period (April 2018-March 2019) compared with a 24-month baseline period (April 2016 -March 2018). This paper aims to investigate reasons for these outcomes and explore a potential causal association between study activities and outcomes.The study was implemented at the tertiary referral hospital in northern Australia. We used the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) as a framework to describe intervention components according to what, how, where, when, how much, tailoring, modifications and reach. Components of the study intervention were: employment of an Aboriginal Interpreter Coordinator, 'Working with Interpreters' training for healthcare providers, and championing of interpreter use by doctors. We evaluated the relative importance of intervention components according to TIDieR descriptors in relation to outcomes. Activities independent of the study that may have affected study findings were reviewed. The relationship between proportion of hospital separations among Aboriginal people ending in self-discharge and numbers of Aboriginal interpreter bookings made during April 2016-March 2019 was tested using linear regression. 'Working with Interpreters' training sessions were undertaken at a regional hospital as well as the tertiary hospital. Training evaluation comprised an anonymous online survey before the training, immediately after and then at six to eight months. Survey data from the sites were pooled for analysis.Employment of the Aboriginal Interpreter Coordinator was deemed the most important component of the intervention, based on reach compared to the other components, and timing of the changes in outcomes in relation to the employment period of the coordinator. There was an inverse association between interpreter bookings and self-discharge rate among Aboriginal inpatients throughout the baseline and intervention period (p = 0.02). This association, the timing of changes and assessment of intercurrent activities at the hospital indicated that the study intervention was likely to be casually related to the measured outcomes.Communication in healthcare can be improved through targeted strategies, with associated improvements in patient outcomes. Health services with high interpreter needs would benefit from employing an interpreter coordinator."

However, full-length genotypes, their frequencies and fitnesses are difficult to measure for evolving gene-length biomolecules using most high-throughput DNA sequencing methods, as short read lengths can lose mutation linkages in haplotypes. Here we present Evoracle, a machine learning method that accurately reconstructs full-length genotypes (R2 = 0.94) and fitness using short-read data from directed evolution experiments, with substantial improvements over related methods. We validate Evoracle on phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE) and phage-assisted non-continuous evolution (PANCE) of adenine base editors and OrthoRep evolution of drug-resistant enzymes. Evoracle retains strong performance (R2 = 0.86) on data with complete linkage loss between neighboring nucleotides and large measurement noise, such as pooled Sanger sequencing data (~US$10 per timepoint), and broadens the accessibility of training machine learning models on gene variant fitnesses. Evoracle can also identify high-fitness variants, including low-frequency 'rising stars', well before they are identifiable from consensus mutations."

This study aimed to assess the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers (HCWs) and the effectiveness of infection control measures.This study had a cross-sectional component and a prospective cohort component. The cross-sectional component comprised an anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody survey among HCWs at a medical center in Saitama City, Japan. In the prospective cohort component, HCWs at the same medical center were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies monthly over a 3-month period (May to July 2020) to assess the effectiveness of infection prevention measures, including personal protective equipment use. All participants in the cohort study also participated in the antibody survey. The primary outcome was anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody (measured using Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2) positivity based on whether participants were engaged in COVID-19-related medical care. Other risk factors considered included occupational category, age, and sex.In total, 607 HCWs participated in the antibody survey and 116 doctors and nurses participated in the cohort study. Only one of the 607 participants in the survey tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. All participants in the cohort study were anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody negative at baseline and remained antibody negative. Engaging in the care of COVID-19 patients did not increase the risk of antibody positivity. During the study period, a total of 30 COVID-19 in-patients were treated in the hospital.The infection control measures in the hospital protected HCWs from nosocomially acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection; thus, HCWs should engage in COVID-19-related medical care with confidence provided that they adhere to infectious disease precautions."
https://openalex.org/W3207651052,"Nitrogen-functionalization is an effective means of improving the catalytic performances of nanozymes. In the present work, plasma-assisted nitrogen modification of nanocolumnar Ni GLAD films was performed using an ammonia plasma, resulting in an improvement in the peroxidase-like catalytic performance of the porous, nanostructured Ni films. The plasma-treated nanozymes were characterized by TEM, SEM, XRD, and XPS, revealing a nitrogen-rich surface composition. Increased surface wettability was observed after ammonia plasma treatment, and the resulting nitrogen-functionalized Ni GLAD films presented dramatically enhanced peroxidase-like catalytic activity. The optimal time for plasma treatment was determined to be 120 s; when used to catalyze the oxidation of the colorimetric substrate TMB in the presence of H2O2, Ni films subjected to 120 s of plasma treatment yielded a much higher maximum reaction velocity (3.7⊆10-8 M/s vs. 2.3⊆10-8 M/s) and lower Michaelis-Menten coefficient (0.17 mM vs. 0.23 mM) than pristine Ni films with the same morphology. Additionally, we demonstrate the application of the nanozyme in a gravity-driven, continuous catalytic reaction device. Such a controllable plasma treatment strategy may open a new door toward surface-functionalized nanozymes with improved catalytic performance and potential applications in flow-driven point-of-care devices."
https://openalex.org/W3203135516,"Cytochromes P450 are versatile enzymes that function in endobiotic and xenobiotic metabolism and undergo meaningful structural changes that relate to their function. However, the way in which conformational changes inform the specific recognition of the substrate is often unknown. Here, we demonstrate the utility of fluorine (19F)-NMR spectroscopy to monitor structural changes in CYP121A1, an essential enzyme from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. CYP121A1 forms functional dimers that catalyze the phenol-coupling reaction of the dipeptide dicyclotyrosine. The thiol-reactive compound 3-bromo-1,1,1-trifluoroacetone was used to label an S171C mutation of the enzyme FG loop, which is located adjacent to the homodimer interface. Substrate titrations and inhibitor-bound 19F-NMR spectra indicate that ligand binding reduces conformational heterogeneity at the FG loop in both the dimer and in an engineered monomer of CYP121A1. However, only the dimer was found to promote a substrate-bound conformation that was preexisting in the substrate-free spectra, thus confirming a role for the dimer interface in dicyclotyrosine recognition. Moreover, 19F-NMR spectra in the presence of substrate analogs indicate the hydrogen-bonding feature of the dipeptide aromatic side chain as a dicyclotyrosine specificity criterion. This study demonstrates the utility of 19F-NMR as applied to a multimeric cytochrome P450, while also revealing mechanistic insights for an essential M. tuberculosis enzyme."

We performed descriptive analyses and multivariable binary logistic regression analyses on weighted data.One out of four adults had oral pain and 4% reported oral health-related productivity loss occasionally or often within the last year of the survey. The odds of oral pain were higher among non-Hispanic black (OR = 1.35; 95%CI = 1.08-1.62) and non-Hispanic Asian individuals (OR = 1.38; 95%CI = 1.07-1.78) compared to non-Hispanic white individuals, and individuals with untreated dental caries (OR = 2.06; 95%CI = 1.72-2.47). The odds for oral health-related productivity loss were 13.85 times higher among individuals who reported oral pain (95%CI = 8.07-23.77), and 2.18 times higher among individuals with untreated dental caries (95%CI = 1.65-2.89). The odds of oral pain and reported oral health-related productivity loss decreased as family income increased.Factors including non-Hispanic black race/ethnicity, lower socio-economic status, and untreated dental caries are associated with oral pain experience, which increases the odds of oral health-related productivity losses. Identifying factors associated with oral pain and productivity loss will enable clinicians, policymakers, and employers to proactively target and prioritize the higher-risk groups in early interventions and policies."
https://openalex.org/W3207698309,"This paper offers a comparative evaluation of the scientific impact of a citizen science program in ecology, ''Vigie-Nature"", managed by the French National Museum of Natural History. Vigie-Nature consists of a national network of amateur observatories dedicated to a participative study of biodiversity in France that has been running for the last twenty years. We collected 123 articles published by Vigie-Nature in international peer-reviewed journals between 2007 and 2019, and computed the yearly amount of citations of these articles between 0-12 years post-publication. We then compared this body of citations with the number of yearly citations relative to the ensemble of the articles published in ecology and indexed in the ''Web of Science"" data-base. Using a longitudinal data analysis, we could observe that the yearly number of citations of the Vigie-Nature articles is significantly higher than that of the other publications in the same domain. Furthermore, this excess of citations tends to steadily grow over time: Vigie-Nature publications are about 1.5 times more cited 3 years after publication, and 3 times more cited 11 years post-publication. These results suggest that large-scale biodiversity citizen science projects are susceptible to reach a high epistemic impact, when managed in specific ways which need to be clarified through further investigations."
https://openalex.org/W3203998404,"Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is an accurate tool to assess modified ribonucleosides and their dynamics in mammalian cells. However, MS/MS quantification of lowly abundant modifications in non-ribosomal RNAs is unreliable, and the dynamic features of various modifications are poorly understood. Here, we developed a 13C labeling approach, called 13C-dynamods, to quantify the turnover of base modifications in newly transcribed RNA. This turnover-based approach helped to resolve mRNA from ncRNA modifications in purified RNA or free ribonucleoside samples and showed the distinct kinetics of the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) versus 7-methylguanosine (m7G) modification in polyA+-purified RNA. We uncovered that N6,N6-dimethyladenosine (m62A) exhibits distinct turnover in small RNAs and free ribonucleosides when compared to known m62A-modified large rRNAs. Finally, combined measurements of turnover and abundance of these modifications informed on the transcriptional versus posttranscriptional sensitivity of modified ncRNAs and mRNAs, respectively, to stress conditions. Thus, 13C-dynamods enables studies of the origin of modified RNAs at steady-state and subsequent dynamics under nonstationary conditions. These results open new directions to probe the presence and biological regulation of modifications in particular RNAs."
https://openalex.org/W3204273730,"The human general transcription factor TFIID is composed of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and 13 TBP-associated factors (TAFs). In eukaryotic cells, TFIID is thought to nucleate RNA polymerase II (Pol II) preinitiation complex formation on all protein coding gene promoters and thus, be crucial for Pol II transcription. TFIID is composed of three lobes, named A, B, and C. A 5TAF core complex can be assembled in vitro constituting a building block for the further assembly of either lobe A or B in TFIID. Structural studies showed that TAF8 forms a histone fold pair with TAF10 in lobe B and participates in connecting lobe B to lobe C. To better understand the role of TAF8 in TFIID, we have investigated the requirement of the different regions of TAF8 for the in vitro assembly of lobe B and C and the importance of certain TAF8 regions for mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) viability. We have identified a region of TAF8 distinct from the histone fold domain important for assembling with the 5TAF core complex in lobe B. We also delineated four more regions of TAF8 each individually required for interacting with TAF2 in lobe C. Moreover, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing indicated that the 5TAF core-interacting TAF8 domain and the proline-rich domain of TAF8 that interacts with TAF2 are both required for mouse embryonic stem cell survival. Thus, our study defines distinct TAF8 regions involved in connecting TFIID lobe B to lobe C that appear crucial for TFIID function and consequent ESC survival."

It is based on a tandem Van-de-Graaff accelerator providing a 16 MeV proton beam and a 3 GHz linac post-accelerator (designs: AVO-ADAM S.A, Geneva, Switzerland and ENEA, Frascati, Italy). To enhance the transmission of the tandem beam through the post-accelerator by a factor of 3, two drift tube buncher units were designed and constructed: A brazed 5-gap structure (adapted SCDTL tank of the TOP-IMPLART project (ENEA)) and a non-brazed low budget 4-gap structure. Both are made of copper. The performance of the two differently manufactured units was evaluated using a 16 MeV tandem accelerator beam and a Q3D magnetic spectrograph. Both buncher units achieve the required summed voltage amplitude of 42 kV and amplitude stability at a power feed of less than 800 W."
https://openalex.org/W3205148898,"The taxonomic compositions of marine prokaryotic communities are known to follow seasonal cycles, but functional metagenomic insights into this seasonality is still limited. We analyzed a total of 22 metagenomes collected at 11 time points over a 14-month period from two sites in Sendai Bay, Japan to obtain seasonal snapshots of predicted functional profiles of the non-cyanobacterial prokaryotic community. Along with taxonomic composition, functional gene composition varied seasonally and was related to chlorophyll a concentration, water temperature, and salinity. Spring phytoplankton bloom stimulated increased abundances of putative genes that encode enzymes in amino acid metabolism pathways. Several groups of functional genes, including those related to signal transduction and cellular communication, increased in abundance during the mid- to post-bloom period, which seemed to be associated with a particle-attached lifestyle. Alternatively, genes in carbon metabolism pathways were generally more abundant in the low chlorophyll a period than the bloom period. These results indicate that changes in trophic condition associated with seasonal phytoplankton succession altered the community function of prokaryotes. Our findings on seasonal changes of predicted function provide fundamental information for future research on the mechanisms that shape marine microbial communities."

However, the number of sub-dominant bacteria, including Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Enterobacteriaceae, positively correlated with age in the HIV(-) group, but not in the HIV(+) group. In the HIV(+) group, Clostridium coccoides group positively associated with the CD4+ cell count and its subsets. In the ART(+) group, Staphylococcus and C. perfringens positively correlated with CD4+ cells and their subsets and negatively with activated CD8+ cells.

https://openalex.org/W3206165839,"Individualised physiotherapy is an effective treatment for low back pain. We sought to determine how this treatment works by using randomised controlled trial data to develop a Bayesian Network model.300 randomised controlled trial participants (153 male, 147 female, mean age 44.1) with low back pain (of duration 6-26 weeks) received either individualised physiotherapy or advice. Variables with potential to explain how individualised physiotherapy works were included in a multivariate Bayesian Network model. Modelling incorporated the intervention period (0-10 weeks after study commencement-""early"" changes) and the follow-up period (10-52 weeks after study commencement-""late"" changes). Sequences of variables in the Bayesian Network showed the most common direct and indirect recovery pathways followed by participants with low back pain receiving individualised physiotherapy versus advice.Individualised physiotherapy directly reduced early disability in people with low back pain. Individualised physiotherapy exerted indirect effects on pain intensity, recovery expectations, sleep, fear, anxiety, and depression via its ability to facilitate early improvement in disability. Early improvement in disability, led to an early reduction in depression both directly and via more complex pathways involving fear, recovery expectations, anxiety, and pain intensity. Individualised physiotherapy had its greatest influence on early change variables (during the intervention period).Individualised physiotherapy for low back pain appears to work predominately by facilitating an early reduction in disability, which in turn leads to improvements in other biopsychosocial outcomes. The current study cannot rule out that unmeasured mechanisms (such as tissue healing or reduced inflammation) may mediate the relationship between individualised physiotherapy treatment and improvement in disability. Further data-driven analyses involving a broad range of plausible biopsychosocial variables are recommended to fully understand how treatments work for people with low back pain.ACTRN12609000834257."
https://openalex.org/W3206770086,"We aimed to determine the needs and opportunities of older lay people to obtain first aid skills. We determined the level of theoretical knowledge of performing first aid with a structured questionnaire, performed on the sample of 842 adult inhabitants of Slovenia. The method of sampling was balanced by using a system of sampling weights in order to correct deviations in the structure of the sample to the level of the population structure. We also checked their attitude regarding the renewal of first aid knowledge. The level of self-assessment of first aid knowledge and actual theoretical knowledge of proper first aid measures typically decreased with age. The percentage of those who had attended first aid courses at any time was statistically significantly lower among respondents over the age of 60; 38% of elderly respondents thought they needed to renew their first aid knowledge, and 44% would attend a suitable first aid course. None of the 29 European Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies member states that responded have a developed a formally adopted first aid program to train the elderly. A tailored first aid training program for the elderly could be one of the many steps that should be taken to ensure adequate health care for the elderly population."
https://openalex.org/W3207625243,"Motion can be perceived in static images, such as photos and figurative paintings, representing realistic subjects in motion, with or without directional information (e.g., motion blur or speed lines). Motion impression can be achieved even in non-realistic static images such as motion illusions and abstract paintings. It has been shown that visual motion processing affects the diameter of the pupil, responding differently to real, illusory, and implied motion in photographs (IM). It has been suggested that these different effects might be due to top-down modulations from different cortical areas underlying their processing. It is worthwhile to investigate pupillary response to figurative paintings, since they require an even higher level of interpretation than photos representing the same kind of subjects, given the complexity of cognitive processes involved in the aesthetic experience. Also, pupil responses to abstract paintings allows to study the effect of IM perception in representations devoid of real-life motion cues. We measured pupil responses to IM in figurative and abstract artworks depicting static and dynamic scenes, as rated by a large group of individuals not participating in the following experiment. Since the pupillary response is modulated by the subjective image interpretation, a motion rating test has been used to correct individual pupil data according to whether participants actually perceived the presence of motion in the paintings. Pupil responses to movies showing figurative and abstract subjects, and to motion illusions were also measured, to compare real and illusory motion with painted IM. Movies, both figurative and abstract, elicit the largest pupillary dilation of all static stimuli, whereas motion illusions cause the smallest pupil size, as previously shown. Interestingly, pupil responses to IM depend on the paintings' style. Figurative paintings depicting moving subjects cause more dilation than those representing static figures, and pupil size increases with the strength of IM, as already found with realistic photos. The opposite effect is obtained with abstract artworks. Abstract paintings depicting motion produce less dilation than those depicting stillness. In any case, these results reflect the individual subjective perception of dynamism, as the very same paintings can induce opposite responses in observer which interpreted it as static or dynamic. Overall, our data show that pupil size depends on high-level interpretation of motion in paintings, even when they do not represent real-world scenes. Our findings further suggest that the pupil is modulated by multiple top-down cortical mechanisms, involving the processing of motion, attention, memory, imagination, and other cognitive functions necessary for enjoying a complete aesthetic experience."

However, it intensifies a dilemma among the job seekers about determining their career goals, because career goals are often influenced by certain socio-demographic and cultural aspects. Hence, this cross-sectional study was designed to investigate the career choices of university students in Bangladesh and to identify its determinants. Administering a self-administered questionnaire (SAQ), data were collected from 422 students at a public university using the multistage stratified sampling. Data were analyzed by bivariate (chi-square) and multivariate (exploratory factor analysis and binary logistic regression) analyses. Findings suggest that the career choices of students vary regarding their gender, religion, and academic track. For example, female (AOR: 0.281; 95% CI: 0.144 to 0.547) and Muslim (AOR: 3.648; 95% CI: 1.765 to 7.542) students preferred public jobs, whereas students of commerce (AOR: 0.344; 95% CI: 0.144 to 0.820) went for private ones. Among socioeconomic issues, only the father's occupation had a substantial effect on career decisions (AOR: 0.347; 95% CI: 0.144 to 0.820). The career choice was also determined by the job prospects (AOR: 1.251; 95% CI: 1.161 to 1.347), preference of family (AOR: 1.238; 95% CI: 1.099 to 1.394), as well as job diversity (AOR: 0.879; 95% CI: 0.795 to 0.972).

Here, we use a recombinant spider silk protein (NT2RepCT) and a functionalized variant carrying a peptide derived from vitronectin (VN-NT2RepCT) as substrates for nerve growth support and neurite extension, using a dorsal root ganglion cell line, ND7/23. Two-dimensional coatings were benchmarked against poly-d-lysine and recombinant laminins. Both spider silk coatings performed as the control substrates with regards to proliferation, survival, and neurite growth. Furthermore, NT2RepCT and VN-NT2RepCT spun into continuous fibers in a biomimetic spinning set-up support cell survival, neurite growth, and guidance to an even larger extent than native spider silk.

https://openalex.org/W3205041646,"Predictive relations between language and literacy skills during the preschool years and children's future reading achievement are well-documented, leading to development and evaluation of preschool interventions targeting early skill development. Although educational researchers have developed and found some positive short- and mid-term effects of language and literacy intervention supplements implemented in early childhood education (ECE) settings, fade-out is a concern. Most studies have targeted children experiencing risk, rather than a more representative sample. Additionally, there are very few studies of long-term intervention effects, and heterogeneity of long-term effects has not been well described. In the present study, we build on initial reports of one of the largest studies of a language and literacy intervention supplement, the SPELL randomized controlled trial implemented as part of the universal ECE system in Denmark. SPELL was delivered to an unselected sample of children at 3-5 years of age (n = 7,076). Results of the base intervention (SPELL) and two enhanced versions featuring extended professional development for teachers (SPELL+PD) or an add-on home-based program for parents (SPELL+HOME) showed short-term effects for literacy outcomes for all children for all SPELL conditions compared to business as usual (BAU). In this follow-up study, we utilized follow-up assessments of 2,700 SPELL 4-5-year-old participants with national reading tests in second grade. The main analyses based on the whole sample showed no significant differences in reading scores in second grade for those in any of the three SPELL conditions relative to the BAU condition. However, moderation analyses demonstrated heterogeneity in intervention effects with children whose mothers had low-mid education showing sustained and mostly large-sized effects. Other risk factors, including income and immigrant background, and condition interacted with at least one outcome variables. These findings suggest that at-risk children in some cases derive long-term benefits from early language and literacy intervention enhancing learning opportunities in ECE settings."
https://openalex.org/W3206602367,"The human pelvic canal (true pelvis) functions to support the abdominopelvic organs and serves as a passageway for reproduction (females). Previous research suggests that these two functions work against each other with the expectation that the supportive role results in a narrower pelvic midplane, while fetal passage necessitates a larger opening. In this research, we examine how gut size relates to the size and shape of the true pelvis, which may have implications on how gut size can influence pelvic floor integrity. Pelves and in vivo gut volumes were measured from CT scans of 92 adults (48 female, 44 male). The true pelvis was measured at three obstetrical planes (inlet, midplane, outlet) using 11 3D landmarks. CT volumetry was used to obtain an individual's gut size. Gut volume was compared to the pelvic planes using multiple regression to evaluate the relationship between gut size and the true pelvis. We find that, in males, larger gut sizes are associated with increased mediolateral canal dimensions at the inlet and midplane. In females, we find that larger gut sizes are associated with more medially-projecting ischial spines and an anteroposteriorly longer outlet. We hypothesize that the association of larger guts with increased canal width in males and increased outlet length in females are adaptations to create adequate space for the gut, while more medially projecting ischial spines reduce the risk of pelvic floor disorders in females, despite its possible spatial consequences for fetal passage."

The study aimed to assess TBIC implementation and analyze case notification rate (CNR) of smear-positive pulmonary TB in the selected health facilities at Dale district, Sidama Zone, Southern Ethiopia.Seven health care facilities have been visited in the study area and smear-positive pulmonary TB notification rate was determined retrospectively during the years 2012 to 2014. Data on smear positive test results and demographic characteristics were collected from the TB unit registries. A structured questionnaire, facility survey, and observation checklists were used to assess the presence of TBIC plans at the health care facilities.The overall case notification rate of smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis was 5.3% among all 7696 TB suspected patients. The odds of being diagnosed with smear-positive TB were 24% more in males than in females (adj OR = 1.24, 95% CI: (1.22, 1.55). Moreover, in the study area, only 28% of the facilities have been practiced TB infection control and 71% of the facilities assigned a focal person for the TBIC plan. The implementation of environmental control measures in the facilities was ranged between 16-83%. N95 particulate respirators were found only in 14% of the facilities.TB CNR in Dale district was low. Moreover, implementations of TBIC in Dale district health facilities were poor when the survey was done. Hence, urgent measures should be taken to reverse the burden of TB."
https://openalex.org/W3205412781,"Steroid hormone effects have been reported for almost 140 years.1-3 In the past 50 years research has led to the discovery of steroid hormone receptors that act via both genomic and nongenomic (“rapid”) mechanisms. Steroids are involved in physiology and disease, mediating endocrine, cardiovascular, and reproductive functions and playing a role in cancer, neurological, metabolic, renal, and cardiovascular diseases.4-7 Over the past decades, both the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) and the International Committee on Rapid Responses to Steroid Hormones (RRSH) have held meetings presenting the newest science on steroid hormone biology and receptor signaling8-26 (Tables 1 and 2). Previously, both FASEB8-14 and RRSH15-26 organized their own conferences, usually in alternating years, and in 2018, decided to organize their first joint conference to be held in the United States. Initially, the organizers of this joint conference (the authors of this manuscript) had selected West Palm Beach, FL, as the venue for the conference, which was to be held July 12-17, 2020. However, when the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic hit earlier that year, plans were put on hold. Hoping for early control of the pandemic, the organizers prepared for a 4-day in-person meeting to be held in Puerto Rico, USA. However, as COVID-19 continued to be a global health concern, challenging societies, scientists, and science around the world, in late 2020, the organizers took the decision to hold the conference as a virtual meeting. The conference was ultimately held online as a 3-day meeting on May 25-27, 2021. It represented the 10th occurrence of the FASEB Science Research Conferences (SRCs) on Steroid Hormones with Daniel E. Frigo (University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA), Zeynep Madak-Erdogan (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA), and Franck Mauvais-Jarvis (Tulane University, New Orleans, LA, USA) as chairs, and the 12th International Meeting on Rapid Responses to Steroid Hormones (RRSH 2020) with Matthias Barton (University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland) and Eric R. Prossnitz (University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA) as chairs. The FASEB and RRSH conferences are usually well received by the scientific community since many presentations and discussion topics include unpublished, cutting-edge research. The combined conference brought together scientists and clinicians from all areas of biology and medicine, covering a broad range of topics related to steroid hormone and steroid hormone receptor function in physiology and human health. The program included one keynote speaker, 38 scheduled invited speakers, 18 short talks (“lightning presentations”) and 28 virtual poster presentations. The conference drew a record attendance of 110 participants, reflecting an increasing interest in steroid hormone signaling in the scientific community. In terms of diversity, women constituted over 55% of attendees and over 40% of all invited speakers. Early career scientists (defined as faculty with <10 years of experience, postdoctoral associates, and graduate students) were also well represented, comprising 55% of all conference attendees. The welcome address was given by Daniel E. Frigo on behalf of FASEB, and Eric R. Prossnitz on behalf of RRSH, who, together with other organizers, led the program. Keynote speaker Donald McDonnell (Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC, USA) set the stage of the conference with his intriguing lecture, “If we knew then what we know now, what would we have done differently to exploit nuclear receptors as drug targets?” Dr McDonnell, who discovered several mechanisms that led to drug treatments for hormone-responsive cancers, provided the audience with a lifetime view of his work, also looking back at the beginnings of field, which he and others pioneered. His lecture was followed by the first session of the day on nuclear steroid receptor regulation of metabolism, led by Sayeepriyadarshini Anakk (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign). A series of lectures by Adriana Maggi (University of Milan, Italy), Carolyn Cummins (University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada), Andrea Hevener (University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA), Sheng Wu (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA), Brian Feldman (University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA), Wen Xie (University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA), and Warren Thomas (Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin, Ireland) presented updates on metabolic functions of estrogen, androgen, and glucocorticoid receptors, as well as evidence for functional roles for estrogen sulfotransferase and steroid sulfatase in energy metabolism, and how aldosterone regulates renal Na+ reabsorption through novel protein kinase D isoforms. The lectures were followed by lively discussions moderated by the session chairs, even though the meeting was held online. Following the first session, Dr Yvette Seger, FASEB Director of Science Policy, introduced the science policy of FASEB and moderated a round table discussion on the subject. The second half of the first day of the conference was dedicated to clinical aspects of therapies targeting steroid hormone receptors. The session was chaired by Jay Gertz (University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA) and Martin Wehling (University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany). Lectures addressed many areas of clinical medicine and disease, including mineralocorticoid receptor function in the treatment of cardiovascular disorders, thyroid receptor signaling in cancer, and membrane progesterone receptor function in the uterus, as well as epigenetics and cistromics in cancer and clinical trials. Lectures were presented by Iris Jaffee (Tufts University, Boston, MA, USA), James Pru (University of Wyoming, Laramie, WY, USA), Paul Davis (Albany Medical College, Albany, NY, USA), Wilbert Zwart (Netherlands Cancer Institute. Amsterdam, The Netherlands), and Mathieu Lupien (University of Toronto). Following the clinical session, a number of young investigators (Florian Le Billan, University of Toronto; Alicia Arredondo Eve, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Ximena Calle Chalco, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile; Innocence Harvey, Pennington Biomedical Research Center, Baton Rouge, LA, USA; and Jia Xu Li, University of Toronto), presented 3-minute poster abstract summaries, which were part of the subsequent virtual poster session presented the same afternoon and well received by the online audience. The second day of the conference began with the morning session focusing on systems biology approaches to interrogate nuclear steroid receptor functions that was chaired by Andrea Cignarella (University of Padova, Padua, Italy) and Lindsey Trevino (City of Hope, Duarte, CA, USA). Topics presented in this session included glucocorticoid receptor-dependent transcription in single cells and individual genes (Trevor Archer, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Durham, NC, USA), imaging of nuclear receptor actions at the single cell level (Fabio Stossi, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA), subcellular localization of estrogen receptor (ER) and cardiometabolism (Pierre Gourdy, University of Toulouse, France), mechanisms of ER enhancer function (Lee Kraus, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA), and steroid G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR)-mediated renal fibrosis in Drosophila (Marc Tatar, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA). Lectures were again followed by talks given by young investigators (Eriko Katsuta, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY, USA; Ayca Mogol, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Qianying Zuo, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; and Kendall Langsten, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USA) and by a career development workshop, “Presenting your science to the public,” by Mila Becker, Chief Policy Officer of the Endocrine Society. The afternoon session was chaired by Martin Kelly (Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA) and included a number of presentations on different aspects of steroid functions in the brain. Gabriele Rune (University of Hamburg, Germany) presented insights into the sex-dependent effects of neurosteroids in the hippocampus; Charlotte Cornil (University of Liège, Belgium) discussed nuclear and membrane actions of neuroestrogens in the control of male sexual behavior, and Margaret Mohr (University of California, Los Angeles) provided an update on estradiol-induced hypothalamic progesterone synthesis during pubertal development. In the second half of the session, Kevin Sinchak (California State University, Long Beach, CA, USA) discussed how neuroprogesterone and progesterone receptor regulate the luteinizing hormone surge, John Meitzen (North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA) gave a talk on how estradiol rapidly modulates excitatory synapse properties in the nucleus accumbens, and Karyn Frick (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA) discussed ERβ activation as a potential treatment for alleviating menopausal symptoms, such as hot flashes. The second day ended with a third lightning round, with four short talks given by young investigators (Michael Saikali, University of Toronto; Dominik Awad, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center; Ashlie Santaliz Casiano, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; and Cameron Leyers, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, NC, USA), summarizing their poster presentations. The last day of the conference was dedicated to novel roles of steroids and steroid receptors in neoplastic and other diseases. The morning session, “Novel functions of steroid receptors in cancer,” was chaired and moderated by Christy Hagan (University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, USA) and Stephen Hammes (University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA). The session was opened by Rosamaria Lappano (University of Calabria, Rende, Italy), who spoke about the role of the membrane estrogen receptor G protein–coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) in breast cancer, followed by Carol Lange (University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA), who discussed the signaling properties of progesterone receptor and glucocorticoid receptors in stemness, and Marina Holz (New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY, USA), who presented new data on estrogen/mTOR cross talk in lymphangioleiomyomatosis and breast cancer. These lectures were followed by Matt Sikora (University of Colorado, Anschutz, CO, USA) who shared recent progress on the role of ERs in the therapy response and resistance in lobular carcinoma breast cancer and by Scott Tomlins (Strata Oncology, Ann Arbor, MI, USA), who gave a talk on high-throughput -omics to identify driver mutations and gene fusions in cancer. The session also featured short talks from five young investigators, with data from their virtual posters (Anasuya Das Gupta, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Sarah El Kharraz, KU Leuven, Belgium; Asmaa El-Kenawi, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL, USA; Wanting Han, University of Massachusetts Boston, Boston, MA, USA; and Thu Trung, University of Minnesota). In the first afternoon session of day 3 of the conference, Donald DeFranco (University of Pittsburgh) and Ellis Levin (University of California, Irvine, CA, USA) moderated a series of lectures on new mechanisms and approaches of how to target steroid receptors. Elahe Mostaghel (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Seattle, WA, USA) centered his discussion on prostate cancer and how adrenal androgens and androgen receptor (AR) axis inhibition may contribute to therapy resistance and serve as predictors of the therapeutic response. Douglas Kojetin (Scripps Research Florida, Jupiter, FL, USA) then presented evidence on how to use nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to visualize ligand-induced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) repression. Edward Filardo (University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA) discussed dual specificity proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) targeting GPER and ERs, and John Katzenellenbogen (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign) presented recent evidence from his laboratory demonstrating ERβ effects in response to very low-affinity ER ligands. All talks were followed by questions from the online audience, with lively and engaging discussions moderated by the chairs. The subsequent afternoon session, which concluded the conference, was chaired by Kristy Brown (Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA) and Subhamoy Dasgupta (Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center). The session focused on mechanisms of cross talk between nuclear steroid receptors and metabolic pathways. Ian Mills (Queens University Belfast, Belfast, UK) discussed how androgens regulate metabolism in prostate cancer, and Rebecca Riggins (Georgetown University, Washington, DC, USA) presented evidence for novel functions of ER-related receptor β (ERRβ) in the pathogenesis of glioblastoma. Giorgia Zadra (National Research Council of Italy, Rome, Italy) reported data on the modulation of intra-tumor lipid metabolism via AR. Erik Nelson (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign) then discussed how cholesterol, ER, and liver X receptors (LXRs) modulate the tumor microenvironment in breast cancer, and Philip Shaul (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center) closed the meeting presentations with data from his and other laboratories on endothelial ER signaling and its effects on cardiometabolic health and disease. Despite the challenges imposed by COVID-19 and the virtual character of the conference, all sessions saw lively discussions and participation from the online audience. Results from the feedback evaluation were very positive regarding the organization of the meeting and the selection of topics. More than 90% of attendees who provided feedback gave favorable comments regarding the general sessions, poster sessions, and the scientific content of the conference. However, there were a few who noted issues with how quickly attendees could access desired on-demand content. Regardless, essentially all respondents of the feedback evaluation indicated that they plan to attend the next meeting, which will be held in 2 years’ time, and that they recommend attending this meeting to other researchers in the field. Many of the speakers and presenters have agreed to write a contribution on the topic of their talks for the conference proceedings, which, as for the last 20 years,9-15, 18-27 will be published in the journal Steroids as a Virtual Special Issue in 2022. The organizers express their gratitude to FASEB and to the numerous sponsors of the meeting, which are listed in the Acknowledgments, especially the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) for providing funding to sponsor virtual travel awards. These awards helped to recognize the contributions of students and postdoctoral trainees in the difficult times of the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to increased attendance at the meeting by junior researchers. Indeed, with the support of the NIH/National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Diseases and the National Cancer Institute (NCI), virtual travel awards were awarded to every student or postdoc who expressed interest in attending the online conference. The next conference (in the form of the 13th International Meeting on Rapid Responses to Steroid Hormones, RRSH 2022) will be held in September 2022 in Paris, France, at the historic venue of the Sorbonne Université, which reaches back to the year 1257 and is one of the oldest and most prestigious universities in the world.28 The organizers are planning for the first in-person meeting after four years and hope to welcome scientists active in all fields of steroid hormone research and medicine in Paris next year. The authors extend special thanks to FASEB for their assistance throughout the organization of this conference, especially Andrea Bauerfeind for her support with organizing the online conference.

https://openalex.org/W3205843669,"Rhipidomys (Sigmodontinae, Thomasomyini) has 25 recognized species, with a wide distribution ranging from eastern Panama to northern Argentina. Cytogenetic data has been described for 13 species with 12 of them having 2n = 44 with a high level of autosomal fundamental number (FN) variation, ranging from 46 to 80, assigned to pericentric inversions. The species are grouped in groups with low FN (46-52) and high FN (72-80). In this work the karyotypes of Rhipidomys emiliae (2n = 44, FN = 50) and Rhipidomys mastacalis (2n = 44, FN = 74), were studied by classical cytogenetics and by fluorescence in situ hybridization using telomeric and whole chromosome probes (chromosome painting) of Hylaeamys megacephalus (HME). Chromosome painting revealed homology between 36 segments of REM and 37 of RMA. We tested the hypothesis that pericentric inversions are the predominant chromosomal rearrangements responsible for karyotypic divergence between these species, as proposed in literature. Our results show that the genomic diversification between the karyotypes of the two species resulted from translocations, centromeric repositioning and pericentric inversions. The chromosomal evolution in Rhipidomys was associated with karyotypical orthoselection. The HME probes revealed that seven syntenic probably ancestral blocks for Sigmodontinae are present in Rhipidomys. An additional syntenic block described here is suggested as part of the subfamily ancestral karyotype. We also define five synapomorphies that can be used as chromosomal signatures for Rhipidomys."
https://openalex.org/W3206001917,"Anthrax is a zoonotic disease caused by the gram-positive spore-forming bacterium Bacillus anthracis. Detecting naturally acquired antibodies against anthrax sublethal exposure in animals is essential for anthrax surveillance and effective control measures. Serological assays based on protective antigen (PA) of B. anthracis are mainly used for anthrax surveillance and vaccine evaluation. Although the assay is reliable, it is challenging to distinguish the naturally acquired antibodies from vaccine-induced immunity in animals because PA is cross-reactive to both antibodies. Although additional data on the vaccination history of animals could bypass this problem, such data are not readily accessible in many cases. In this study, we established a new enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) specific to antibodies against capsule biosynthesis protein CapA antigen of B. anthracis, which is non-cross-reactive to vaccine-induced antibodies in horses. Using in silico analyses, we screened coding sequences encoded on pXO2 plasmid, which is absent in the veterinary vaccine strain Sterne 34F2 but present in virulent strains of B. anthracis. Among the 8 selected antigen candidates, capsule biosynthesis protein CapA (GBAA_RS28240) and peptide ABC transporter substrate-binding protein (GBAA_RS28340) were detected by antibodies in infected horse sera. Of these, CapA has not yet been identified as immunoreactive in other studies to the best of our knowledge. Considering the protein solubility and specificity of B. anthracis, we prepared the C-terminus region of CapA, named CapA322, and developed CapA322-ELISA based on a horse model. Comparative analysis of the CapA322-ELISA and PAD1-ELISA (ELISA uses domain one of the PA) showed that CapA322-ELISA could detect anti-CapA antibodies in sera from infected horses but was non-reactive to sera from vaccinated horses. The CapA322-ELISA could contribute to the anthrax surveillance in endemic areas, and two immunoreactive proteins identified in this study could be additives to the improvement of current or future vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W3206176154,"Disuse-induced bone loss is seen following spinal cord injury, prolonged bed rest, and exposure to microgravity. We performed whole transcriptomic profiling of cortical bone using RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and RNA molecular barcoding (NanoString) on a hindlimb unloading (HLU) mouse model to identify genes whose mRNA transcript abundances change in response to disuse. Eleven-week old female C57BL/6 mice were exposed to ambulatory loading or HLU for 7 days (n = 8/group). Total RNA from marrow-flushed femoral cortical bone was analyzed on HiSeq and NanoString platforms. The expression of several previously reported genes associated with Wnt signaling and metabolism was altered by HLU. Furthermore, the increased abundance of transcripts, such as Pfkfb3 and Mss51, after HLU imply these genes also have roles in the cortical bone’s response to altered mechanical loading. Our study demonstrates that an unbiased approach to assess the whole transcriptomic profile of cortical bone can reveal previously unidentified mechanosensitive genes and may eventually lead to novel targets to prevent disuse-induced osteoporosis."
