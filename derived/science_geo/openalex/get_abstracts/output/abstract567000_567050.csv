Here, we combine genome-wide RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and ATAC-seq to compare the transcriptional and epigenetic identity of small intestinal ILCs, identifying thousands of distinct gene profiles and regulatory elements. Single-cell RNA-seq and flow and mass cytometry analyses reveal compartmentalization of cytokine expression and metabolic activity within the three classical ILC subtypes and highlight transcriptional states beyond the current canonical classification. In addition, using antibiotic intervention and germ-free mice, we characterize the effect of the microbiome on the ILC regulatory landscape and determine the response of ILCs to microbial colonization at the single-cell level. Together, our work characterizes the spectrum of transcriptional identities of small intestinal ILCs and describes how ILCs differentially integrate signals from the microbial microenvironment to generate phenotypic and functional plasticity.

Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are the most recently discovered arm of the innate immune system, consisting of cytotoxic cells (NK cells) and “helper-like” ILCs (Eberl et al., 2015aEberl G. Colonna M.

The latter are characterized by expression of the interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7Ra/CD127) and are enriched at mucosal sites, where they contribute to the maintenance of tissue homeostasis and host defense against infection (Artis and Spits, 2015Artis D.

Transcriptional profiling studies have assigned gene expression signatures to each of the known ILC subsets and suggested key molecules involved in the control of ILC activity (Robinette et al., 2015Robinette M.L.

Rev. Immunol. 2015; 15: 415-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). At the same time, heterogeneous transcript abundances within each subset point toward a higher complexity and plasticity that is not captured by the current classification scheme (Bjorklund et al., 2016Bjorklund A.K.

Immunol. 2016; 17: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The activity of ILCs is shaped by multiple tissue-specific signals, including nutrients and environmental xenobiotics (Kiss et al., 2011Kiss E.A. Vonarbourg C. Kopfmann S. Hobeika E. Finke D.

It has also been reported that the activity of type III ILCs is influenced by the intestinal microbiota (Sanos et al., 2009Sanos S.L. Bui V.L. Mortha A. Oberle K. Heners C. Johner C. Diefenbach A.

RORγt+ innate lymphoid cells regulate intestinal homeostasis by integrating negative signals from the symbiotic microbiota.Nat. Immunol. 2011; 12: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). However, the full scope by which the microbiota impacts the function of all three ILC subsets remains elusive. Similarly, it remains to be investigated how ILCs integrate changes in the local tissue environment, including alterations in microbial colonization, into the gene regulatory landscapes. Recent investigations into the chromatin landscape of human and mouse ILCs suggested a potential role for subset-specific regulomes in this process (Koues et al., 2016Koues O.I. Collins P.L. Cella M. Robinette M.L. Porter S.I. Pyfrom S.C. Payton J.E. Colonna M. Oltz E.M.

In this study, we used genome-wide chromatin and transcriptional profiling coupled to unbiased single-cell transcriptomic analysis to generate the first comprehensive map of the entirety of ILCs residing in the small intestinal lamina propria. We discover a strong degree of functional compartmentalization within all ILC subsets, manifesting as specialized expression of defined cytokines and metabolic pathways by distinct subpopulations. Beyond the known ILC subtypes, we also identify two additional transcriptional states that fail to fit within the current canonical classification. Using this high-resolution subset mapping, we profile the impact of commensal bacterial colonization on gene regulatory programs in ILCs on the single-cell level, identify epigenetic mechanisms of ILC specification, and determine influences of the microbiota on the chromatin landscapes of ILCs. To study the dynamics of gene regulation in ILCs, we first profiled the transcriptomes of the three canonical subsets of helper-like ILCs (Figure 1A). To this end, we purified CD127+ ILCs from the small intestine of RORγt-GFP reporter mice, and sorted RORγt–NKp46+ ILC1s, RORγt− KLRG-1+ ILC2s, and RORγt+ ILC3s for transcriptional profiling by RNA-seq (Figures 1A and S1A). We carefully ruled out contaminations from other cell types by comparing the obtained transcriptional profiles with those from purified intestinal myeloid populations (Figures S1B and S1C) (Lavin et al., 2014Lavin Y. Winter D. Blecher-Gonen R. David E. Keren-Shaul H. Merad M. Jung S. Amit I. Tissue-resident macrophage enhancer landscapes are shaped by the local microenvironment.Cell. 2014; 159: 1312-1326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). We then focused on the set of 1,821 genes that were most highly expressed and differential across the three types (see STAR★Methods and Table S1). In order to identify global patterns of gene expression, we performed k-means clustering (k = 6) that divided the data into genes that were uniquely expressed by each of the types (Figure 1B, clusters I–III) and those that are shared between two types of ILCs (Figure 1B, clusters IV–VI). Successful purification of ILC subsets was confirmed by the specific expression pattern of the lineage transcription factors Tbx21 encoding T-bet (ILC1), Gata3 (ILC2), and Rorc encoding RORγ (ILC3), as well as the signature cytokines Ifng (ILC1), Il4, Il5, Il13 (ILC2), and Il22 (ILC3) (Figures 1B and 1C). Interestingly, KEGG analysis of the 1,161 subset-specific genes identified pathways involved in intracellular metabolism, such as mTOR and Notch signaling in ILC1s, sphingolipid and amino acid metabolism in ILC2s, and carbohydrate metabolism as well as glycolysis in ILC3s (Figure S1D), suggesting a differential metabolic profile in each type of ILC that might be coupled to their unique activities. In line with this finding, several additional transcription factors, soluble mediators, and metabolic enzymes featured subset-specific expression patterns, including the hexokinases Hk2 and Hk3 as well as enolase-1 and phosphofructokinase that likely represent active glycolysis in ILC3s (Figures S1E–S1G).Figure S1Transcriptional Characteristics of ILC Subsets, Related for Figure 1Show full caption(A) FACS plots showing gating strategy for sorting of canonical ILCs subtypes.(B and C) Comparative analysis of gene expression in ILCs and myeloid cells.(D) KEGG pathway annotation for each of the 6 clusters in Figure 1B.(E–G) Heatmap showing gene expression in selected examples of regulatory factors (E), cytokines and chemokines (F), and metabolic enzymes (G) from each of the gene clusters in Figure 1B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) (A) FACS plots showing gating strategy for sorting of canonical ILCs subtypes.

We found 660 genes shared between two groups of ILCs. Of note, ILC1s and ILC3s shared the largest group of common transcripts (306), including the transcription factor Hopx and the cytokine Il16, supporting the notion these subsets share a functional relationship and flexibility in classification (Bernink et al., 2015Bernink J.H. Krabbendam L. Germar K. de Jong E. Gronke K. Kofoed-Nielsen M. Munneke J.M. Hazenberg M.D. Villaudy J.

A T-bet gradient controls the fate and function of CCR6-RORγt+ innate lymphoid cells.Nature. 2013; 494: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Among the genes expressed by more than one subset were the urea cycle enzymes Arg1 (ILC2/3) and Odc1 (ILC1/3), the chemokines Cxcl2 and Cxcl3 (ILC2/3), as well as the growth factor Vegfa (ILC2/3) (Figures 1C and S1E–S1G). Together, these data define rich transcriptional, immunologic, and metabolic programs unique to each subset of ILCs but also identify elements spanning across the defined subsets (Figures S1D–S1G). We next sought to characterize the chromatin landscape underlying the observed transcriptional programs in the three ILC subsets. Because the small intestine of a mouse typically harbors less than 50,000 ILCs in each subset, obtaining accurate epigenetic profiling with conventional technology presents a major challenge. To enable high-sensitivity in vivo chromatin analysis from such a low number of cells obtained from individual mice, we developed a modification of our previously described indexing-first chromatin immunoprecipitation approach (iChIP) (Lara-Astiaso et al., 2014Lara-Astiaso D. Weiner A. Lorenzo-Vivas E. Zaretsky I. Jaitin D.A. David E. Keren-Shaul H. Mildner A. Winter D. Jung S. et al.Immunogenetics. Chromatin state dynamics during blood formation.Science. 2014; 345: 943-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), which involves the integration of a linear amplification step using in vitro transcription (IVT) preceding DNA library preparation (Figures 2A and S2A). Since IVT amplification requires only a single ligation event to label and amplify the chromatin molecule, this iChIP-IVT protocol is 8-fold more sensitive and results in an increased ChIP library complexity from small cell numbers (Figure S2B). Indeed, highly reproducible H3K4me2 signals were achieved from as little as 100 cells (Figure S2C).Figure S2A Modified Protocol for High-Sensitivity In Vivo Chromatin Analysis, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Schematic view of important steps in the iChIP-IVT protocol.

We then applied iChIP-IVT on the three subsets of small intestinal ILCs. We assayed several histone modifications including trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3), H3K4me2, and H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) in order to profile the global landscape for a variety of regulatory elements. The obtained chromatin signatures were free of contamination by other cell types, as evidenced by the absence of signal from myeloid or T lymphocyte-specific regulatory regions (Figures S3A and S3B) (Lara-Astiaso et al., 2014Lara-Astiaso D. Weiner A. Lorenzo-Vivas E. Zaretsky I. Jaitin D.A. David E. Keren-Shaul H. Mildner A. Winter D. Jung S. et al.Immunogenetics. Chromatin state dynamics during blood formation.Science. 2014; 345: 943-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Promoters, characterized by the enrichment of H3K4me3, tended to be shared among all three ILC subsets (6,206 out of 8,770 H3K4me3 regions) (Figure S3C; see STAR★Methods) consistent with the early developmental acquisition of chromatin organization in ILCs (Shih et al., 2016Shih H.Y. Sciumè G. Mikami Y. Guo L. Sun H.W. Brooks S.R. Urban Jr., J.F. Davis F.P. Kanno Y. O’Shea J.J. Developmental acquisition of regulomes underlies innate lymphoid cell functionality.Cell. 2016; 165: 1120-1133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In contrast, a large set of enhancers, distal regions marked by H3K4me2, were unique to each subset (1,268 in ILC1s, 5,934 in ILC2s, and 4,998 in ILC3s), implicating the enhancer landscape in the regulation of subset-specific gene expression (Figures 2B–2D and S3C; Table S2). Indeed, the six gene expression clusters were differentially linked to enhancers from the three ILC subsets, particularly when the enhancers are active (H3K27ac enrichment) (Figures 2B and S3D). In order to more precisely analyze specific transcription factor binding sites, we performed an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq) (Buenrostro et al., 2013Buenrostro J.D. Giresi P.G. Zaba L.C. Chang H.Y. Greenleaf W.J. Transposition of native chromatin for fast and sensitive epigenomic profiling of open chromatin, DNA-binding proteins and nucleosome position.Nat. Methods. 2013; 10: 1213-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (3186) Google Scholar) on all ILC subsets and analyzed peaks of open chromatin within enhancer regions. At each of the loci encoding the three key transcription factors (Tbx21, Gata3, and Rorc), we observed differential chromatin landscape between the ILC subsets (Figure 2C). The same was true for the signature cytokines. For example, the locus of Ifng depicts at least one unique enhancer candidate upstream of the gene (Figure 2D), suggesting subset-specific transcription factor binding. In the case of Arg1, which is expressed in ILC2 and ILC3 (Figure 1C), both subsets appeared to be enriched for H3K4me2 at the transcription start site, while ILC2s featured an additional peak 25 kb upstream (Figure S3E), possibly associated with more complex regulation leading to higher expression in this subset (Figure 1C). In addition, we used a de novo motif-finding algorithm to search for enriched sequences in subset-specific regions compared to the full set of enhancers. We identified a unique motif signature for each ILC type, suggesting widespread binding of the relevant transcription factor: GATA3 in ILC2s (p = 10−36) and ROR response element (RORE) in ILC3s (p = 10−102) (Figure 2E; Table S3). Surprisingly, the top enriched motif signature for ILC1-specific enhancers was PU.1 (p = 10−50), which is not known to play a role in ILC1 regulation. We also analyzed each enhancer cluster for enrichment of known motifs (p < 10−5) against the genomic background (Figures 2F and S3F). This approach confirmed the presence of T-bet binding in ILC1-specific enhancers and revealed new candidate transcriptional regulators (Figures 2F and S3F). Collectively, these data describe the chromatin landscape and regulatory control regions of the three ILC subsets and highlight a network of transcription factors that uniquely control the transcriptional identity of each cell type. As the transcriptional and epigenetic profiles described above were obtained from populations sorted according to a small number of canonical markers of ILC subtypes, the observed gene expression signatures likely represent a composite picture of related and plastic subsets, such as NKp46+ and NKp46– ILC3s (Bernink et al., 2015Bernink J.H.

https://openalex.org/W2509291718,"In vertebrates, sterols are necessary for Hedgehog signaling, a pathway critical in embryogenesis and cancer. Sterols activate the membrane protein Smoothened by binding its extracellular, cysteine-rich domain (CRD). Major unanswered questions concern the nature of the endogenous, activating sterol and the mechanism by which it regulates Smoothened. We report crystal structures of CRD complexed with sterols and alone, revealing that sterols induce a dramatic conformational change of the binding site, which is sufficient for Smoothened activation and is unique among CRD-containing receptors. We demonstrate that Hedgehog signaling requires sterol binding to Smoothened and define key residues for sterol recognition and activity. We also show that cholesterol itself binds and activates Smoothened. Furthermore, the effect of oxysterols is abolished in Smoothened mutants that retain activation by cholesterol and Hedgehog. We propose that the endogenous Smoothened activator is cholesterol, not oxysterols, and that vertebrate Hedgehog signaling controls Smoothened by regulating its access to cholesterol."
https://openalex.org/W2517512733,"Neurons transmit information to distant brain regions via long-range axonal projections. In the mouse, area-to-area connections have only been systematically mapped using bulk labeling techniques, which obscure the diverse projections of intermingled single neurons. Here we describe MAPseq (Multiplexed Analysis of Projections by Sequencing), a technique that can map the projections of thousands or even millions of single neurons by labeling large sets of neurons with random RNA sequences (""barcodes""). Axons are filled with barcode mRNA, each putative projection area is dissected, and the barcode mRNA is extracted and sequenced. Applying MAPseq to the locus coeruleus (LC), we find that individual LC neurons have preferred cortical targets. By recasting neuroanatomy, which is traditionally viewed as a problem of microscopy, as a problem of sequencing, MAPseq harnesses advances in sequencing technology to permit high-throughput interrogation of brain circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2517926000,"Zika virus (ZIKV)-related neuropathology is an important global health concern. Several studies have shown that ZIKV can infect neural stem cells in the developing brain, but infection in the adult brain has not been examined. Two areas in the adult mouse brain contain neural stem cells: the subventricular zone of the anterior forebrain and the subgranular zone of the hippocampus. Here, using 6-week-old mice triply deficient in interferon regulatory factor (IRF) as a model, we show that blood-borne ZIKV administration can lead to pronounced evidence of ZIKV infection in these adult neural stem cells, leading to cell death and reduced proliferation. Our data therefore suggest that adult as well as fetal neural stem cells are vulnerable to ZIKV neuropathology. Thus, although ZIKV is considered a transient infection in adult humans without marked long-term effects, there may in fact be consequences of exposure in the adult brain."
https://openalex.org/W2509008602,"Hydrocarbon-stapled peptides are a class of bioactive alpha-helical ligands developed to dissect and target protein interactions. While there is consensus that stapled peptides can be effective chemical tools for investigating protein regulation, their broader utility for therapeutic modulation of intracellular interactions remains an active area of study. In particular, the design principles for generating cell-permeable stapled peptides are empiric, yet consistent intracellular access is essential to in vivo application. Here, we used an unbiased statistical approach to determine which biophysical parameters dictate the uptake of stapled-peptide libraries. We found that staple placement at the amphipathic boundary combined with optimal hydrophobic and helical content are the key drivers of cellular uptake, whereas excess hydrophobicity and positive charge at isolated amino acid positions can trigger membrane lysis at elevated peptide dosing. Our results provide a design roadmap for maximizing the potential to generate cell-permeable stapled peptides with on-mechanism cellular activity."

Here, we present a massively parallel system for assaying the effect of gene expression levels on fitness in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by systematically altering the expression level of ∼100 genes at ∼100 distinct levels spanning a 500-fold range at high resolution. We show that the relationship between expression levels and growth is gene and environment specific and provides information on the function, stoichiometry, and interactions of genes. Wild-type expression levels in some conditions are not optimal for growth, and genes whose fitness is greatly affected by small changes in expression level tend to exhibit lower cell-to-cell variability in expression. Our study addresses a fundamental gap in understanding the functional significance of gene expression regulation and offers a framework for evaluating the phenotypic effects of expression variation."
https://openalex.org/W2509205468,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by a high degree of inflammation and profound immune suppression. Here we identify Yes-associated protein (Yap) as a critical regulator of the immunosuppressive microenvironment in both mouse and human PDAC. Within Kras:p53 mutant pancreatic ductal cells, Yap drives the expression and secretion of multiple cytokines/chemokines, which in turn promote the differentiation and accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) both in vitro and in vivo. Pancreas-specific knockout of Yap or antibody-mediated depletion of MDSCs promoted macrophage reprogramming, reactivation of T cells, apoptosis of Kras mutant neoplastic ductal cells and pancreatic regeneration after acute pancreatitis. In primary human PDAC, YAP expression levels strongly correlate with an MDSC gene signature, and high expression of YAP or MDSC-related genes predicts decreased survival in PDAC patients. These results reveal multifaceted roles of YAP in PDAC pathogenesis and underscore its promise as a therapeutic target for this deadly disease."
https://openalex.org/W2513214720,"The authors show that hypothalamic neurons that synthesize tyrosine hydroxylase regulate food intake and body weight. By a combination of dopamine and GABA release, these neurons modulate the activity of both pro-opiomelanocortin neurons and paraventricular nucleus neurons that also contribute to energy homeostasis. Energy homeostasis, food intake, and body weight are regulated by specific brain circuits. Here we introduce an unexpected neuron, the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) neuron of the arcuate nucleus (ARC), that we show makes an orexigenic contribution. Optogenetic stimulation of mouse ARC TH neurons increased food intake; attenuating transmitter release reduced body weight. Optogenetic stimulation of ARC TH cells inhibited pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons through synaptic mechanisms. ARC TH cells project to the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus; optogenetic stimulation of ARC TH axons inhibited paraventricular nucleus neurons by dopamine and GABA co-release. Dopamine excited orexigenic neurons that synthesize agouti-related peptide and neuropeptide Y but inhibited anorexigenic neurons that synthesize POMC, as determined by whole cell recording. Food deprivation increased c-fos expression and spike frequency in ARC TH neurons. The gut peptide ghrelin evoked direct excitatory effects, suggesting these neurons monitor metabolic cues. Together these data support the view that ARC TH cells play an unrecognized and influential positive role in energy homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2508829585,"Understanding individual susceptibility to drug-induced cardiotoxicity is key to improving patient safety and preventing drug attrition. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) enable the study of pharmacological and toxicological responses in patient-specific cardiomyocytes (CMs) and may serve as preclinical platforms for precision medicine. Transcriptome profiling in hiPSC-CMs from seven individuals lacking known cardiovascular disease-associated mutations and in three isogenic human heart tissue and hiPSC-CM pairs showed greater inter-patient variation than intra-patient variation, verifying that reprogramming and differentiation preserve patient-specific gene expression, particularly in metabolic and stress-response genes. Transcriptome-based toxicology analysis predicted and risk-stratified patient-specific susceptibility to cardiotoxicity, and functional assays in hiPSC-CMs using tacrolimus and rosiglitazone, drugs targeting pathways predicted to produce cardiotoxicity, validated inter-patient differential responses. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated pathway correction prevented drug-induced cardiotoxicity. Our data suggest that hiPSC-CMs can be used in vitro to predict and validate patient-specific drug safety and efficacy, potentially enabling future clinical approaches to precision medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2507643563,"Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) is an emerging epigenetic enzyme that mainly represses transcription of target genes via symmetric dimethylation of arginine residues on histones H4R3, H3R8 and H2AR3. Accumulating evidence suggests that PRMT5 may function as an oncogene to drive cancer cell growth by epigenetic inactivation of several tumor suppressors. Here, we provide evidence that PRMT5 promotes prostate cancer cell growth by epigenetically activating transcription of the androgen receptor (AR) in prostate cancer cells. Knockdown of PRMT5 or inhibition of PRMT5 by a specific inhibitor reduces the expression of AR and suppresses the growth of multiple AR-positive, but not AR-negative, prostate cancer cells. Significantly, knockdown of PRMT5 in AR-positive LNCaP cells completely suppresses the growth of xenograft tumors in mice. Molecular analysis reveals that PRMT5 binds to the proximal promoter region of the AR gene and contributes mainly to the enriched symmetric dimethylation of H4R3 in the same region. Mechanistically, PRMT5 is recruited to the AR promoter by its interaction with Sp1, the major transcription factor responsible for AR transcription, and forms a complex with Brg1, an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler, on the proximal promoter region of the AR gene. Furthermore, PRMT5 expression in prostate cancer tissues is significantly higher than that in benign prostatic hyperplasia tissues, and PRMT5 expression correlates positively with AR expression at both the protein and mRNA levels. Taken together, our results identify PRMT5 as a novel epigenetic activator of AR in prostate cancer. Given that inhibiting AR transcriptional activity or androgen synthesis remains the major mechanism of action for most existing anti-androgen agents, our findings also raise an interesting possibility that targeting PRMT5 may represent a novel approach for prostate cancer treatment by eliminating AR expression."
https://openalex.org/W2511592035,"Cardiac dysfunction develops during sepsis in humans and rodents. In the model of polymicrobial sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), we investigated the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the heart. Mouse heart homogenates from sham-procedure mice contained high mRNA levels of NLRP3 and IL-1β. Using the inflammasome protocol, exposure of cardiomyocytes (CMs) to LPS followed by ATP or nigericin caused release of mature IL-1β. Immunostaining of left ventricular frozen sections before and 8 h after CLP revealed the presence of NLRP3 and IL-1β proteins in CMs. CLP caused substantial increases in mRNAs for IL-1β and NLRP3 in CMs which are reduced in the absence of either C5aR1 or C5aR2. After CLP, NLRP3-/- mice showed reduced plasma levels of IL-1β and IL-6. In vitro exposure of wild-type CMs to recombinant C5a (rC5a) caused elevations in both cytosolic and nuclear/mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), which were C5a-receptor dependent. Use of a selective NOX2 inhibitor prevented increased cytosolic and nuclear/mitochondrial ROS levels and release of IL-1β. Finally, NLRP3-/- mice had reduced defects in echo/Doppler parameters in heart after CLP. These studies establish that the NLRP3 inflammasome contributes to the cardiomyopathy of polymicrobial sepsis.-Kalbitz, M., Fattahi, F., Grailer, J. J., Jajou, L., Malan, E. A., Zetoune, F.

https://openalex.org/W2509961279,"Immunomodulatory Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) form a heterogeneous population consisting of subsets with different activation states, migratory properties and suppressive functions. Recently, expression of the IL-33 receptor ST2 was shown on Tregs in inflammatory settings. Here we report that ST2 expression identifies highly activated Tregs in mice even under homeostatic conditions. ST2+ Tregs preferentially accumulate at non-lymphoid sites, likely mediated by their high expression of several chemokine receptors facilitating tissue homing. ST2+ Tregs exhibit a Th2-biased character, expressing GATA-3 and producing the Th2 cytokines IL-5 and IL-13 -especially in response to IL-33. Yet, IL-33 is dispensable for the generation and maintenance of these cells in vivo. Furthermore, ST2+ Tregs are superior to ST2- Tregs in suppressing CD4+ T cell proliferation in vitro independent of IL-33. This higher suppressive capacity is partially mediated by enhanced production and activation of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and TGFβ. Thus, ST2 expression identifies a highly activated, strongly suppressive Treg subset preferentially located in non-lymphoid tissues. Here ST2+ Tregs may be well positioned to immediately react to IL-33 alarm signals. Their specific properties may render ST2+ Tregs useful targets for immunomodulatory therapies."

Somatic stem cells can generate progeny throughout life, but their fates are usually restricted, and they generate specific cell types in their respective tissue. Active adult neural stem cells (NSCs) are present in two regions of the brain: the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles and the subgranule zone of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) (Ihrie and Alvarez-Buylla, 2011Ihrie R.A.

During embryonic development, Drosha maintains embryonic NSCs in an undifferentiated, multipotent state by targeting and cleaving the mRNA of the proneural factor Ngn2 (Knuckles et al., 2012Knuckles P.

Neurosci. 2012; 15: 962-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This non-canonical function of Drosha does not require Dicer or miRNAs, and is a rapid mechanism for fate regulation. Here, we examined how Drosha is involved in the regulation of DG NSC fate. We found that Drosha controls DG NSC maintenance and cell fate acquisition through a non-canonical regulation of the transcription factor nuclear factor IB (NFIB). We show that NFIB is required for the oligodendrocytic commitment by DG NSCs and propose that Drosha promotes neurogenesis and inhibits oligodendrocyte fate acquisition in the hippocampus by repressing NFIB. NSCs in the DG of the adult mouse are Notch dependent and express the Notch target Hes5 (Lugert et al., 2010Lugert S. Basak O. Knuckles P. Haussler U. Fabel K. Götz M. Haas C.A. Kempermann G.

Commun. 2012; 3: 670Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Drosha is expressed by most cells in the DG, including GFAP+ and Hes5+ radial NSCs (Figures S1A and S1B). To address the functions of Drosha in neurogenic DG NSCs, we treated Hes5::CreERT2 mice carrying floxed Drosha (Drosha cKO) or wild-type (wt) Drosha (ctrl) alleles with tamoxifen (TAM) and followed cell fate by lineage tracing (Rosa26-CAG::EGFP) (Figures 1A and S1A) (Lugert et al., 2012Lugert S.

Commun. 2012; 3: 670Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Twenty-one days after TAM administration, Hes5+ NSCs and their progeny were Drosha deficient and generated fewer cells compared with controls (Figures S1B–S1D). Furthermore, the number of radial GFAP+, Sox2+, and mitotic (PCNA+) NSC/progenitors and neuroblasts (DCX+) was reduced in Drosha cKO animals (Figures 1B–1F and S1E). Decreased neurogenesis persisted in Drosha cKO animals at 100 days, and the reduction in newborn neurons (GFP+NeuN+) was accompanied by an increase in S100β+ parenchymal astrocytes compared with controls (Figures 1G–1I and S1F–S1J). In addition, GFAP+ putative radial NSCs were lost in Drosha cKO animals (Figures 1G, 1J, and 1K). Together these data suggest that Drosha is required for NSC maintenance and promotes neurogenesis in the DG at the expense of gliogenesis. Quiescent DG NSCs activate, proliferate, and produce neuroblasts in response to seizures (Hüttmann et al., 2003Hüttmann K. Sadgrove M. Wallraff A. Hinterkeuser S. Kirchhoff F. Steinhäuser C.

We addressed whether NSC-like progenitors remain in the Drosha cKO and can still respond to activating stimuli. We administered epileptogenic kainic acid (KA) to induce seizures in Hes5::CreERT2 Drosha cKO and control mice 21 days after TAM induction (Figure S1K). Whereas KA induced proliferation and an increase in neuroblasts in control animals (Figures S1L and S1M), neither proliferation (PCNA+) nor neuroblast (DCX+) production was increased following KA treatment of Drosha cKO mice (Figures S1L and S1N). This suggests that Drosha cKO diminishes the DG NSC pool and compromises progenitor reactivation. To examine whether Drosha controls neurogenesis by acting on quiescent NSCs, we ablated Drosha specifically in radial GFAP+ NSCs by stereotactic infection with adenoviruses expressing Cre-recombinase under the control of the gfap promoter (adeno-gfap::Cre) (Figure S2A) (Merkle et al., 2007Merkle F.T. Mirzadeh Z. Alvarez-Buylla A. Mosaic organization of neural stem cells in the adult brain.Science. 2007; 317: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Six days post-infection (dpi), most GFP-labeled, adeno-gfap::Cre-infected cells in the subgranular zone in control mice were GFAP+ putative radial NSCs (Figures S2B–S2D). Twenty-one days post-infection, adeno-gfap::Cre-infected NSCs had generated mitotic (PCNA+) progenitors and neuroblasts (DCX+) in control animals, but Sox2+ and PCNA+ progenitors were almost absent, and newly formed neuroblasts were reduced in Drosha cKO animals (Figures 2A–2E). Therefore, Drosha cKO DG NSCs lose stem cell potential, demonstrating that Drosha is essential for NSC maintenance and neurogenesis. DG NSCs normally generate glutamatergic granule neurons and astrocytes but not oligodendrocytes (Bonaguidi et al., 2011Bonaguidi M.A. Wheeler M.A. Shapiro J.S. Stadel R.P. Sun G.J. Ming G.L. Song H. In vivo clonal analysis reveals self-renewing and multipotent adult neural stem cell characteristics.Cell. 2011; 145: 1142-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Following adeno-gfap::Cre-mediated Drosha cKO, a significant number of the newborn cells expressed Olig2 and Sox10, markers of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) (Figures 2D–2G). Similarly, we observed newly generated Sox10+, Olig2+, and NG2+ OPCs in Hes5::CreERT2 Drosha cKO animals (Figures S2E–S2G). Thus, Drosha cKO induces a fate switch in DG NSCs to oligodendrocytes. We performed clonal analysis of Hes5::CreERT2 Drosha cKO NSC fate. Two days after low-dose TAM induction, labeled NSCs were sparse in the DG (mean distance between clones = 184.3 ± 17.2 μm; Figures S2H and S2I). Twenty-one days post-TAM, 6 of the 41 clones examined in Drosha cKO animals contained OPCs but none in the controls (Figures 2H, 2I, S2J, and S2K). Interestingly, 1 clone contained neuroblasts, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, indicating tri-lineage potential of Drosha cKO NSC in vivo (Figure 2H). We addressed whether Drosha controls oligodendrocyte production from mitotic GFAP− stem/progenitor cells. We infected dividing cells in the DG with a Cre-expressing retrovirus. We did not see oligodendrocyte formation in the Drosha cKO after retro-Cre virus infection, and active progenitors continued to generate neuroblasts (Figures S2L and S2M). These data suggest that Drosha deletion induces a fate shift in the quiescent NSC pool to oligodendrocyte production but not in active NSC/progenitors. Dicer regulates miRNA maturation downstream of Drosha. To investigate whether Drosha regulates oligodendrocyte commitment of NSCs via miRNAs, we deleted Dicer (Dicer cKO) from radial DG NSCs with the adeno-gfap::Cre virus (Figure S2A). Dicer cKO did not affect the number of Sox2+ progenitors (data not shown) and caused a minor decrease in neuroblasts, consistent with the role of Dicer in neuronal survival and maturation (Figures 2G, S2N, and S2O) (Davis et al., 2008Davis T.H. Cuellar T.L. Koch S.M. Barker A.J. Harfe B.D. McManus M.T. Ullian E.M. Conditional loss of Dicer disrupts cellular and tissue morphogenesis in the cortex and hippocampus.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 4322-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Unlike Drosha cKO, Dicer cKO did not induce oligodendrocytic differentiation of DG NSCs (ctrl versus Dicer cKO, p = 0.56; Figures 2F and 2G). Therefore, Drosha but not Dicer inhibits oligodendrocyte differentiation of adult DG NSCs in vivo, indicating that the mechanism of induced fate switching caused by the loss of Drosha does not primarily involve miRNAs. To investigate the mechanisms of Drosha-regulated NSC fate acquisition, we generated a self-renewing DG NSC culture system that recapitulates in vivo features of neurogenesis including expression of the progenitor markers Sox2 and BLBP (Figure S2P). Upon growth factor removal (−FGF2/−EGF), DG NSCs differentiated into neurons and astrocytes but not oligodendrocytes, indicating conserved intrinsic cell fate restriction (Figure S2Q; data not shown) (Bonaguidi et al., 2011Bonaguidi M.A. Wheeler M.A. Shapiro J.S. Stadel R.P. Sun G.J. Ming G.L. Song H.

We cultured DG NSCs from adult Droshafl/fl, Dicerfl/fl, and Droshawt/wtDicerwt/wt (control) animals that carried the Rosa26-CAG::EGFP Cre reporter. Following adeno-Cre viral transduction, we investigated the effects of Drosha and Dicer cKO (Figures S2R and S2S). Two days post-infection, BLBP+ progenitors were reduced in the Drosha cKO compared with control and Dicer cKO cultures, similar to the reduction in progenitors after Drosha ablation in vivo (Figures 2J–2M). Both differentiated Drosha cKO and Dicer cKO NSCs generated fewer neurons in vitro (Figures 2M and S2T–S2V). However, we observed an increase in apoptotic cells (cleaved Caspase3+) in the Dicer cKO cultures compared with Drosha cKO and control, confirming that Dicer is crucial for neuronal survival and providing an explanation for the reduction in neurons in its absence (Figure S2W). Drosha cKO induced an increase in NG2+ OPCs in the cultures and this at the expense of neuron and astrocyte production (Figures 2K, 2M, and S2X). Dicer cKO induced a slight but not significant increase in NG2+ OPCs in the cultures (ctrl versus Dicer cKO, p = 0.27; Figures 2L and 2M). Hence, DG NSCs retain a cell-intrinsic bias against oligodendrocyte differentiation in vitro, and Drosha controls this fate decision. We sorted Drosha cKO, Dicer cKO, and control DG NSCs 48 hr after adeno-Cre virus infection in vitro and determined the expression profiles of 381 miRNAs by microarray. Two hundred sixty miRNAs were detected in control DG NSCs (mean Ct values < 32), and their levels were not significantly changed 48 hr after Drosha cKO (R2 = 0.81; Figure S2Y), even though the phenotypes were well established by this time. Dicer cKO resulted in moderate changes in miRNA levels after 48 hr (R2 = 0.66; Figure S2Z), although Dicer cKO NSCs did not display an obvious phenotype at this time. Hence, Drosha cKO did not cause major global changes in miRNA levels, and any changes were less than in Dicer cKO DG NSCs. These data support that the mechanism of Drosha suppression of oligodendrocyte production by DG NSCs is independent of Dicer and miRNAs. Drosha can bind and cleave hairpin loops in mRNAs (Chong et al., 2010Chong M.M. Zhang G. Cheloufi S. Neubert T.A. Hannon G.J. Littman D.R.

To examine whether Drosha binds directly to NFIB mRNA in DG NSCs, we performed cross-linked immunoprecipitation (CLIP) for endogenous Drosha protein and examined the bound RNAs (Figures S3A and S3B). NFIB mRNA cross-linked immunoprecipitated with Drosha from DG NSCs, as did the known target DGCR8 mRNA (Figures 3B and S3B) (Han et al., 2009Han J. Pedersen J.S. Kwon S.C. Belair C.D. Kim Y.K.

Neurosci. 2012; 15: 962-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In order to address whether either of the two NFIB mRNA hairpins convey Drosha association, we placed the 5′ UTR HP and 3′ UTR HP into the SV40 3′ UTR downstream of the Renilla Luciferase (rLuc) coding region of the psiCheck reporter vector (Figure 3C). We expressed 5′ UTR HP and 3′ UTR HP containing rLuc mRNAs in N2a cells and performed CLIP to address binding by Drosha. Both the 5′ UTR HP and 3′ UTR HP of NFIB bound to Drosha more efficiently than the SV40 3′ UTR sequence alone (Figure 3D). These data suggest that both NFIB mRNA hairpins are bound by Drosha. We evaluated whether Drosha cleaves the NFIB hairpins by in vitro processing assays (Figure 3E) (Lee and Kim, 2007Lee Y. Kim V.N. In vitro and in vivo assays for the activity of Drosha complex.in: Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, 2007: 87-106Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Incubation of in vitro transcribed NFIB 3′ UTR RNA with purified Flag-tagged Drosha resulted in cleavage and generation of RNA fragments (Figure 3F). NFIB 5′ UTR HP was not cleaved in vitro, suggesting that, although bound, it is not processed by Drosha (Figure S3C). We assessed whether fragmented NFIB mRNAs were present in DG NSCs in vivo by 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′RACE). Multiple NFIB mRNAs fragmented in the vicinity of the 3′ UTR HP were detected in wt NSCs (Figure S3D). Fragmented NFIB transcripts were not detected in Drosha cKO NSCs, supporting that NFIB mRNA fragmentation at the 3′ UTR HP is dependent on Drosha (Figure S3D). Sequencing and mapping of 48 independent clones of the NFIB 5′RACE fragments supported the in vitro processing analysis (Figures 3F and S3D). The multiple fragmented RNA species suggest that either Drosha processing of the 3′ UTR HP is not as accurate as its processing of a pri-miRNA RNA or additional ribonucleases may be associated with the Drosha complex, and these cleave the RNAs further. We analyzed changes in NFIB RNA fragmentation in sorted NSCs following Drosha cKO compared with control by qRT-PCR over the 3′ UTR HP. Drosha cKO increased the relative levels of non-cleaved NFIB transcripts, confirming the Drosha-dependent destabilization of NFIB RNAs in vivo (Figure 3G). To evaluate whether Drosha affects translation of NFIB 3′ UTR HP mRNAs, we performed Luciferase assays in cultured adult DG NSCs (Figure S3E). Drosha cKO increased Luciferase activity of an NFIB 3′ UTR HP containing synthetic mRNA (Figure S3F). Surprisingly, Dicer cKO also increased translation of the NFIB 3′ UTR HP containing Luciferase mRNA by an unknown mechanism, indicating that under these experimental conditions, Dicer can also regulate NFIB 3′ UTR HP containing mRNAs. Drosha interaction with hairpins in mRNAs can result in destabilization of the transcripts (Han et al., 2009Han J. Pedersen J.S. Kwon S.C. Belair C.D. Kim Y.K. Yeom K.H. Yang W.Y. Haussler D.

Drosha mRNA levels were reduced in Drosha cKO cells compared with controls (Figure S3G). Interestingly, NFIB mRNA levels were increased in Drosha cKO NSCs, suggesting that Drosha suppresses NFIB mRNA expression in DG NSCs in vivo (Figure S3G). As cultured DG NSCs retain Drosha function and blockade of oligodendrocyte differentiation, we speculated that Drosha-dependent regulation of NFIB should also be present in vitro. We infected DG NSCs in vitro with adeno-Cre virus and isolated Drosha cKO and control NSCs by FACS 2 dpi (Figure S3H).

https://openalex.org/W2512497893,"The prototypical second messenger cAMP regulates a wide variety of physiological processes. It can simultaneously mediate diverse functions by acting locally in independently regulated microdomains. In mammalian cells, two types of adenylyl cyclase generate cAMP: G-protein-regulated transmembrane adenylyl cyclases and bicarbonate-, calcium- and ATP-regulated soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC). Because each type of cyclase regulates distinct microdomains, methods to distinguish between them are needed to understand cAMP signaling. We developed a mass-spectrometry-based adenylyl cyclase assay, which we used to identify a new sAC-specific inhibitor, LRE1. LRE1 bound to the bicarbonate activator binding site and inhibited sAC via a unique allosteric mechanism. LRE1 prevented sAC-dependent processes in cellular and physiological systems, and it will facilitate exploration of the therapeutic potential of sAC inhibition."

https://openalex.org/W2513498847,"Drug delivery into the brain is impeded by the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) that filters out the vast majority of drugs after systemic administration. In this work, we assessed the transport, uptake and cytotoxicity of promising drug nanocarriers, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs), in in vitro models of the BBB. RBE4 rat brain endothelial cells and Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells, strain II, were used as BBB models. We studied spherical and rod-shaped MSNs with the following modifications: bare MSNs and MSNs coated with a poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(ethylene imine) (PEG-PEI) block copolymer. In transport studies, MSNs showed low permeability, whereas the results of the cellular uptake studies suggest robust uptake of PEG-PEI-coated MSNs. None of the MSNs showed significant toxic effects in the cell viability studies. While the shape effect was detectable but small, especially in the real-time surface plasmon resonance measurements, coating with PEG-PEI copolymers clearly facilitated the uptake of MSNs. Finally, we evaluated the in vivo detectability of one of the best candidates, i.e. the copolymer-coated rod-shaped MSNs, by two-photon in vivo imaging in the brain vasculature. The particles were clearly detectable after intravenous injection and caused no damage to the BBB. Thus, when properly designed, the uptake of MSNs could potentially be utilized for the delivery of drugs into the brain via transcellular transport."
https://openalex.org/W2508660045,"CSN6, a critical subunit of the constitutive photomorphogenesis 9 (COP9) signalosome (CSN), has received attention as a regulator of the degradation of cancer-related proteins such as p53, c-myc and c-Jun, through the ubiquitin-proteasome system, suggesting its importance in cancerogenesis. However, the biological functions and molecular mechanisms of CSN6 in glioblastoma (GBM) remain poorly understood. Here, we report that GBM tumors overexpressed CSN6 compared with normal brain tissues and that CSN6 promoted GBM cell proliferation, migration, invasion and tumorigenesis. Erlotinib, a small-molecule epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was used to reveal that the proliferative and metastatic effects of CSN6 on GBM cells were EGFR dependent. We also found that CSN6 positively regulated EGFR stability via reduced levels of EGFR ubiquitination, thereby elevating steady expression of EGFR. In addition, this study is the first description of a novel role for the CSN6-interacting E3 ligase, CHIP (carboxyl terminus of heat-shock protein 70-interacting protein), regulating EGFR ubiquitination in cancer cells. We showed that CSN6 associated with CHIP and led to CHIP destabilization by increasing CHIP self-ubiquitination. Moreover, CSN6 decreased CHIP expression and increased EGFR expression in the tumor samples. Deregulation of this axis promoted GBM cell’s proliferation and metastasis. Thus, our study provides insights into the applicability of using the CSN6-CHIP-EGFR axis as a potential therapeutic target in cancer."

The IGF2 receptor, IGF1 R, was expressed at high levels in CSC-enriched populations in primary breast cancer cells. Moreover, IGF2-PI3K (IGF2-phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase) signaling induced expression of a stemness transcription factor, inhibitor of DNA-binding 1 (ID1), and IGF2 itself. ID1 knockdown greatly reduced IGF2 expression, and tumor sphere formation. Finally, treatment with anti-IGF1/2 antibodies blocked tumorigenesis derived from the IGF1Rhigh CSC-enriched population in a patient-derived xenograft model. Thus, NF-κB may trigger IGF2-ID1-IGF2-positive feedback circuits that allow cancer stem-like cells to appear. Then, they may become addicted to the circuits. As the circuits are the Achilles' heels of CSCs, it will be critical to break them for eradication of CSCs."
https://openalex.org/W2512919990,"Abstract The macrophage receptor mincle binds to trehalose dimycolate on the surface of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Signaling initiated by this interaction leads to cytokine production, which underlies the ability of mycobacteria to evade the immune system and also to function as adjuvants. In previous work the mechanism for binding of the sugar headgroup of trehalose dimycolate to mincle has been elucidated, but the basis for enhanced binding to glycolipid ligands, in which hydrophobic substituents are attached to the 6-hydroxyl groups, has been the subject of speculation. In the work reported here, the interaction of trehalose derivatives with bovine mincle has been probed with a series of synthetic mimics of trehalose dimycolate in binding assays, in structural studies by x-ray crystallography, and by site-directed mutagenesis. Binding studies reveal that, rather than reflecting specific structural preference, the apparent affinity of mincle for ligands with hydrophobic substituents correlates with their overall size. Structural and mutagenesis analysis provides evidence for interaction of the hydrophobic substituents with multiple different portions of the surface of mincle and confirms the presence of three Ca2+-binding sites. The structure of an extended portion of the extracellular domain of mincle, beyond the minimal C-type carbohydrate recognition domain, also constrains the way the binding domains may interact on the surface of macrophages."

Treatment with the clinically relevant Wnt agonists LiCl or CHIR99021 restored TRF2 expression and reversed gastrointestinal DC phenotypes, including organoid formation in vitro, and maturation of intestinal tissue and xenografted organoids in vivo.

Oxidation of methionine disrupts the structure and function of a range of proteins, but little is understood about the chemistry that underlies these perturbations. Using quantum mechanical calculations, we found that oxidation increased the strength of the methionine-aromatic interaction motif, a driving force for protein folding and protein-protein interaction, by 0.5–1.4 kcal/mol. We found that non-hydrogen-bonded interactions between dimethyl sulfoxide (a methionine analog) and aromatic groups were enriched in both the Protein Data Bank and Cambridge Structural Database. Thermal denaturation and NMR spectroscopy experiments on model peptides demonstrated that oxidation of methionine stabilized the interaction by 0.5–0.6 kcal/mol. We confirmed the biological relevance of these findings through a combination of cell biology, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations on (i) calmodulin structure and dynamics, and (ii) lymphotoxin-α binding toTNFR1. Thus, the methionine-aromatic motif was a determinant of protein structural and functional sensitivity to oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2514605726,"According to the prevailing view of neural development, sensory pathways develop sequentially in a feedforward manner, whereby each local microcircuit refines and stabilizes before directing the wiring of its downstream target. In the visual system, retinal circuits are thought to mature first and direct refinement in the thalamus, after which cortical circuits refine with experience-dependent plasticity. In contrast, we now show that feedback from cortex to thalamus critically regulates refinement of the retinogeniculate projection during a discrete window in development, beginning at postnatal day 20 in mice. Disrupting cortical activity during this window, pharmacologically or chemogenetically, increases the number of retinal ganglion cells innervating each thalamic relay neuron. These results suggest that primary sensory structures develop through the concurrent and interdependent remodeling of subcortical and cortical circuits in response to sensory experience, rather than through a simple feedforward process. Our findings also highlight an unexpected function for the corticothalamic projection."

The fact that two of these mutations, R665W and L845F, imparted upon PLCγ2 an ∼2–3-fold ibrutinib-insensitive increase in the concentration of cytosolic Ca2+ following ligation of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) led to the assumption that the two mutants exhibit constitutively enhanced intrinsic activity. Here, we show that the two PLCγ2 mutants are strikingly hypersensitive to activation by Rac2 such that even wild-type Rac2 suffices to activate the mutant enzymes upon its introduction into intact cells. Enhanced basal activity of PLCγ2 in intact cells is shown using the pharmacologic Rac inhibitor EHT 1864 and the PLCγ2F897Q mutation mediating Rac resistance to be caused by Rac-stimulated rather than by constitutively enhanced PLCγ2 activity. We suggest that R665W and L845F be referred to as allomorphic rather than hypermorphic mutations of PLCG2. Rerouting of the transmembrane signals emanating from BCR and converging on PLCγ2 through Rac in ibrutinib-resistant CLL cells may provide novel drug treatment strategies to overcome ibrutinib resistance mediated by PLCG2 mutations or to prevent its development in ibrutinib-treated CLL patients."

Previous work has defined individual ligands that regulate embryonic and adult NPCs, including neurotransmitters (Haydar et al., 2000Haydar T.F. Wang F. Schwartz M.L. Rakic P.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5012-5023PubMed Google Scholar). Nonetheless, we still lack an overview of the NPC growth factor microenvironment. How might we obtain such an overview? We have chosen to do so by combining transcriptomic and proteomic profiling to analyze the embryonic murine cortex during the period of neurogenesis. At this time, cortical radial precursors are maintained in a neuroepithelium, with their apical endfeet forming the interface with the lateral ventricles, and their basal processes extending to the cortical surface. These radial precursors generate neurons that delaminate from the apical epithelium and migrate basally in intimate contact with the radial precursor processes (Noctor et al., 2001Noctor S.C. Flint A.C. Weissman T.A. Dammerman R.S. Kriegstein A.R. Neurons derived from radial glial cells establish radial units in neocortex.Nature. 2001; 409: 714-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar). To understand the growth factors that are important during this process, we have focused upon these two cell types, radial precursors and their newborn neuronal progeny, and have used an iterative systems biology strategy. We show that cultured cortical precursors secrete factors that promote their own maintenance, while cortical neurons secrete factors that promote neurogenesis. To identify these secreted factors, we defined the transcriptome and cell-surface proteome of cultured cortical precursors and neurons and used these data to model the growth factor communication within and between these two populations. This model predicts a complex growth factor communication network that provides the basis for multiple potential autocrine and paracrine interactions. We tested this model by focusing on growth factors that might enhance neurogenesis, and in so doing, have identified three factors, IFNγ, Nrtn, and GDNF, that are necessary and sufficient for the neurogenic differentiation of radial precursor cells in vivo. During neurogenesis, the cortex is largely comprised of radial precursors and newborn neurons. To identify secreted ligands within this microenvironment, we studied embryonic day 13 (E13) cortical cultures that are comprised of proliferating Sox2 and Pax6-positive radial precursors, and a small number of intermediate progenitors, the neurogenic transit-amplifying cells in this system (Gauthier-Fisher et al., 2009Gauthier-Fisher A. Lin D.C. Greeve M. Kaplan D.R. Rottapel R. Miller F.D. Lfc and Tctex-1 regulate the genesis of neurons from cortical precursor cells.Nat.

These cultured precursors generate neurons for 4–5 days and then switch to making glia at 6–7 days. Immunostaining confirmed this cellular composition after 20 and 72 hr of culture (Figures 1A and 1B ). There were no CD31-positive blood vessel cells, Iba1-positive microglia, GFAP-positive astrocytes, or MBP-positive oligodendrocytes at either time point. Instead, at 20 hr about 75% and 25% of the cells were Pax6-positive radial precursors and βIII-tubulin-positive neurons, respectively. By 72 hr, radial precursors had decreased to about 55%, and neurons had increased. At both time points, 6%–9% of cells were Tbr2-positive intermediate progenitors. We asked whether these cultures were density dependent by plating E13 precursors for 3 days at 7,000 to 440,000 cells/cm2. Immunostaining (Figures 1C and 1D) showed that at low cell densities (7,000 to 28,000 cells/cm2), most precursors differentiated into neurons. As densities increased, the relative proportion of neurons decreased, until at densities ≥110,000 cells/cm2, only 20%–30% of cells were neurons, while 65%–75% were proliferating Ki67-positive precursors. Survival was also increased at higher cell densities (Figure 1D). To ask whether these density-dependent effects were due to secreted molecules, we collected medium conditioned by high-density cultures (110,000 cells/cm2) for 3 days. At the time we collected the medium, about 23% of cells were neurons and the rest were precursors. We applied this conditioned medium to E13 precursors cultured at low density (14,000 cells/cm2). Immunostaining after 3 days (Figures 1E and 1F) showed that in control medium, about 70% and 30% of cells were neurons and proliferating precursors, respectively. In contrast, conditioned medium from high-density cultures reduced this to about 40% neurons and 60% proliferating precursors, proportions similar to those in high-density cultures (Figure 1D). Survival, however, was only modestly reduced by high-density conditioned medium (Figure 1F). Since high-density cultures are mostly precursors, these data indicate that they secrete molecules to enhance their own expansion. We next asked whether newborn cortical neurons also secrete factors that influence cortical precursor biology. To do this, we transfected E13 precursors with plasmids encoding the piggybac (PB) transposase and a PB-EGFP reporter that indelibly marks a subset of precursors and all of their progeny (Gallagher et al., 2013Gallagher D. Norman A.A. Woodard C.L. Yang G. Gauthier-Fisher A. Fujitani M. Vessey J.P. Cancino G.I. Sachewsky N. Woltjen K. et al.Transient maternal IL-6 mediates long-lasting changes in neural stem cell pools by deregulating an endogenous self-renewal pathway.Cell Stem Cell. 2013; 13: 564-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We then isolated and cultured E16 cortical neurons for 4 days. Immunostaining (Figures 1G and 1H) confirmed that almost all cells were βIII-tubulin-positive neurons, with no Iba1-positive microglia, CD31-positive endothelial cells, Pax6-positive radial precursors, CC1- or MBP-positive oligodendrocytes, and only a very few cells expressing the astrocyte marker GFAP, the glial precursor marker Olig2, or Ki67. We mixed these unlabelled cortical neurons with the transfected, labeled precursors at a ratio of 6:1 precursors to neurons. Immunostaining 1 day later showed that adding unlabelled neurons increased the genesis of EGFP-positive neurons, and concomitantly decreased the EGFP-positive, proliferating Ki67-positive precursors (Figures 1I–1K). To ask whether this proneurogenic effect was due to factors secreted by the added neurons, we prepared conditioned medium from the purified cultured neurons and added it, with FGF2 (which is in the basal precursor medium), to freshly plated E13 precursors. Analysis 3 days later showed that, relative to control medium containing FGF2, neuron-conditioned medium increased newborn neurons and decreased proliferating precursors (Figure 1L). These data indicate that cortical neurons and precursors secrete factors that promote neurogenesis and proliferation, respectively. To identify the relevant ligands, we used a computational modeling method that makes use of microarray-based transcriptomic data to predict autocrine/paracrine interactions (Qiao et al., 2014Qiao W. Wang W. Laurenti E. Turinsky A.L. Wodak S.J. Bader G.D. Dick J.E. Zandstra P.W. Intercellular network structure and regulatory motifs in the human hematopoietic system.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2014; 10: 741Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Initially, we performed microarrays on cortical precursors and neurons. For the neurons, we used 5 day cultures, when they were almost a pure neuronal population (see Figures 1G and 1H). For the precursors, we grew E13 cultures at 100,000 cells/cm2 for 20 hr, at which point they were 75% radial precursors, 5%–10% intermediate progenitors, and 20% newborn neurons (called enriched precursors from hereon) (Figure S1A). We also analyzed a culture containing precursors mixed with purified cortical neurons at a 6:1 ratio. For each population, we isolated total RNA from three independent biological replicates and analyzed it on Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Arrays. This analysis showed that 1,479 genes were at least 2-fold differentially expressed when comparing neurons and enriched precursors (p < 0.05 FDR) (Figure 2A; Table S1). Unbiased hierarchical clustering using the complete-linkage method of an Euclidean distance matrix of log2 normalized expression data showed that the neuron and enriched precursor replicates each clustered closely and that the mixed population clustered closest to the enriched precursors, likely because the mixed cultures contained more precursors than neurons (20%–25% newborn neurons in the enriched precursors plus 16% added neurons) (Figure 2A). Gene ontology (GO) analysis showed that, as predicted, differentially expressed genes in neurons versus precursors were highly enriched for processes such as cell cycle, neurogenesis, generation of neurons, and neuron differentiation (Figure S1B). Thus, this approach readily distinguished neurons from enriched precursors. We next defined the growth factor and receptor mRNAs in these datasets using a curated database of secreted ligands and their cognate receptors (Qiao et al., 2014Qiao W. Wang W. Laurenti E. Turinsky A.L. Wodak S.J. Bader G.D. Dick J.E. Zandstra P.W. Intercellular network structure and regulatory motifs in the human hematopoietic system.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2014; 10: 741Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) (Table S2). Cortical neurons and enriched precursors expressed 338 ligand mRNAs (Table S3), of which 244 were expressed at similar levels in both populations. However, 59 and 35 ligand genes were expressed more highly in neurons and precursors, respectively (Figure 2B; Table S4), with expression differences from 2- to 17-fold (Figure 2C). The most highly enriched neuronal ligands included SPARCL1 (hevin), inhibin βA (as a homodimer, called activin A), growth arrest-specific 6 (Gas6), CCL17 (TARC), and neuregulin 3. The most highly enriched precursor ligands included interleukin 1α, interleukin 1β, midkine (mdk), the Notch ligand Jagged, and the Frizzled 4 ligand Norrin (ndp). Neurons and precursors also expressed 348 receptor mRNAs (Table S3), with 197 expressed at similar levels. 71 and 80 receptor mRNAs were enriched in neurons and precursors, respectively (Figure 2B; Table S4), with expression differences of 2- to 11-fold (Figure 2D). Receptor mRNAs most highly enriched in neurons included neuropeptide receptors for NPY, neurotensin, and hypocretin and neurotransmitter receptors such as the ionotropic glutamate receptors 2a and 2b. The most highly enriched precursor receptors included Notch 1 and 2, Frizzled 2, and FGF receptors 1 and 3. We used these transcriptome data to assemble a cortical precursor/cortical neuron communication model (see flow chart in Figure S1C). Initially, we used a perturbation statistical model (PERT) (Qiao et al., 2012Qiao W. Quon G. Csaszar E. Yu M. Morris Q. Zandstra P.W. PERT: a method for expression deconvolution of human blood samples from varied microenvironmental and developmental conditions.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2012; 8: e1002838Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) that analyzes gene expression measurements of individual cells alone and when mixed together to calculate how their profiles might change in a heterogeneous environment such as the embryonic cortex. For example, some cytokines upregulate expression of their receptors, so in a mixed population where one population expresses the cytokine and the other the receptor, paracrine cytokine exposure would increase receptor mRNA in the second population. A comparison with the purified populations allows the mixed profile to be deconvolved into its constituent parts and allows the expression profiles of each individual gene to be corrected for the more biologically relevant mixed population conditions. We used the corrected neuron and enriched precursor reference gene expression profiles together with the curated ligand and receptor database and our previously published methodology for assembling cell interaction networks (Qiao et al., 2014Qiao W. Wang W. Laurenti E. Turinsky A.L. Wodak S.J. Bader G.D. Dick J.E. Zandstra P.W. Intercellular network structure and regulatory motifs in the human hematopoietic system.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2014; 10: 741Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar; see the flow chart in Figure S1C) to construct an autocrine/paracrine communication network for the cortical precursor/neuron interactions (Figure 2F; Table S5). In the resultant model, each node is a secreted ligand and each line is a direction of communication from precursor to precursor, neuron to neuron, precursor to neuron, or neuron to precursor. Ligands predicted to be autocrine (acting within the same population of cells) for cortical precursors and cortical neurons are denoted CP and CN, respectively. Ligands denoted as autocrine for both populations (and there are many) could also potentially function in a paracrine fashion. Ligands that are predicted specifically as paracrine (from one cell type to another) are shown as nodes located between the neurons and precursors. This model supports a number of conclusions. First, it predicts a large number of potential ligand-receptor interactions between the two populations (Figure 2F; Table S5), many of which are known to be important for cortical precursors, including FGF2, EGF, Wnt ligands, neurotrophins, PDGFs, ligands of the gp130 family, BMPs, and Notch (Gauthier-Fisher and Miller, 2013Gauthier-Fisher A. Miller F.D. Environmental cues and signalling pathways that regulate neural precursor development.in: Rubenstein J.L. Rakic P. Patterning and Cell Type Specification in the Developing CNS and PNS: Comprehensive Developmental Neuroscience. Elsevier Press, 2013: 355-383Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). However, this model also predicts many potential ligand-receptor interactions not previously considered within a neural precursor context such as those involving Gastrin Releasing Peptide (GRP) and CCL3 (macrophage inflammatory protein-1α). Second, these data showed that most ligand and receptor mRNAs are expressed at statistically similar levels in neurons and enriched precursors (Figures 2B and 2F; Table S5). Third, because of the large overlap in precursor and neuron ligands and receptors, the model predicts that many interactions would be both autocrine and paracrine, with only 51 limited to a directional paracrine signal. Of these, 16 involved differentially expressed ligands with 11 enriched in neurons, including cholecystokinin (CCK), fractalkine (CX3CL1), and GRP, and five in precursors, including CCL3, Ephrin-B1, and bone-morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP1) (Figure 2E). Finally, we asked whether any of the receptors and ligands in this model were highly co-expressed, as might be predicted by their function in a cell-cell communication network, using weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA). WGCNA on the nine ligand/receptor datasets (three each from precursors, neurons, and the mixed cells) identified clusters of coexpressed receptors and ligands (Figure S1D; Table S5). By comparison, WGCNA on a similar number of randomly selected genes in the parent microarray datasets did not generate these coexpression modules (Figure S1E). These modules were relevant for both precursors and neurons, as shown by overlaying them on the communication network (Figure S1F), and included ligand/receptor groups known to be important in the embryonic cortex, including, in the cluster color-coded turquoise, the neurotrophins (NT3, BDNF, NGF, TrkB, TrkC), the insulin/IGF family (IGF1, IGF1R, IGF2R, insulin receptor), and PDGFs (PDGFA, PDGFB, PDGFC, PDGFRβ). Intriguingly, some unanticipated ligand/receptor families were also co-expressed in this cluster, including IFNγ (IFNγ, IFNγRα, IFNγRβ) and the GDNF family (GDNF, persephin, GFRα1, GFRα2, GFRα4, Ret). One disadvantage of a transcriptome-based model is that the correlation between mRNA abundance and protein expression levels is weaker for cell-surface proteins such as growth factor receptors than for proteins in other compartments (Lundberg et al., 2010Lundberg E. Fagerberg L. Klevebring D. Matic I. Geiger T. Cox J. Algenäs C. Lundeberg J. Mann M. Uhlen M. Defining the transcriptome and proteome in three functionally different human cell lines.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2010; 6: 450Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). We therefore characterized the cell-surface proteome of cortical neurons and enriched precursors. To do this, we performed periodate oxidation of cell-surface glycans on cultured cells using established methods to couple glycosylated proteins to a hydrazide resin (McDonald et al., 2009McDonald C.A. Yang J.Y. Marathe V. Yen T.Y. Macher B.A. Combining results from lectin affinity chromatography and glycocapture approaches substantially improves the coverage of the glycoproteome.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2009; 8: 287-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, Schiess et al., 2009Schiess R. Mueller L.N. Schmidt A. Mueller M. Wollscheid B. Aebersold R. Analysis of cell surface proteome changes via label-free, quantitative mass spectrometry.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2009; 8: 624-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The coupled, selectively modified glycosylated cell-surface proteins were then tryptically digested, glycopeptides released by PNGase F, and peptides identified by mass spectrometry. For each sample, we analyzed three independent biological replicates. This analysis identified 1,506 and 1,571 proteins on cortical neurons and precursors, respectively (Table S6). GO analysis of these proteins using PANTHER identified high enrichment for terms associated with the exterior of cells/vesicles as well as membrane-bound components as expected for cell-surface proteins (Figure S2A; Table S7). Further analysis using PANTHER classified, in both neurons and precursors, over 200 proteins as receptors, and about 100 as transporters (Figure 3A; Table S8). Other major categories included cell adhesion molecules, extracellular matrix proteins, and signaling proteins (Figure 3A; Table S8). PANTHER analysis also identified four major receptor categories with similar proportions in both cell populations: protein kinase receptors, cytokine receptors, ligand-gated ion channels, and G protein-coupled receptors (Figure 3B; Table S9). Transporters fell into three major subcategories that were equally represented in both populations: ion channels, cation transporters, and amino acid transporters (Figure 3C; Table S9). The similarities between neurons and precursors extended to other cell-surface proteins such as cell adhesion molecules and extracellular matrix proteins. However, some proteins were highly enriched in one or the other population. For example, many neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels, including multiple glutamate receptors, were enriched in neurons, while the insulin receptor, the netrin receptor DCC, and the tyrosine-protein kinase receptor ROR2 were enriched in precursors (Figure 3D). We integrated the cell-surface proteome data with our transcriptome-based communication model by identifying receptors for ligands in the transcriptome model and overlapping them with those from the proteomic data (Figure 3E; Figure S2B). This verified 32 receptors and 86 of 292 potential ligands in the transcriptome-based model. Most of these receptors were present on both populations, with the exception of Met and FGFR3, which were only detectable on neurons and enriched precursors, respectively. A comparison of the relative expression of the 32 validated receptors demonstrated a positive correlation between the log2 fold-changes computed from the proteome versus the transcriptome data (Figures 3F and 3G), supporting the quantitative nature of this combined approach. To validate our communication model in vivo, we first asked whether the predicted ligands were expressed in the embryonic cortex, comparing them to the ligand mRNAs expressed at levels greater than or equal to FGF2 mRNA in previously published E13/14 cortex microarray data (Kusek et al., 2012Kusek G. Campbell M. Doyle F. Tenenbaum S.A. Kiebler M. Temple S. Asymmetric segregation of the double-stranded RNA binding protein Staufen2 during mammalian neural stem cell divisions promotes lineage progression.Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 11: 505-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar; GEO: GSE38222). We chose this as our cut-off, since FGF2 is expressed in and functionally relevant for the E13/14 cortex (Raballo et al., 2000Raballo R. Rhee J. Lyn-Cook R. Leckman J.F. Schwartz M.L. Vaccarino F.M. Basic fibroblast growth factor (Fgf2) is necessary for cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the developing cerebral cortex.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5012-5023PubMed Google Scholar). 263 growth factor mRNAs were expressed in the cortex at this age (Table S10), and 86% (227 of 263) of these were predicted in the transcriptome model (Figure 4A). We also used Spearman rank correlation to compare relative ligand mRNA expression in E13/14 cortex, cortical neurons, and enriched precursors. This analysis (Figure 4B) showed high correlations between all three groups. In contrast, there were low correlations between these groups and microglia ligand mRNAs expressed at levels higher than or equal to FGF2 that were extracted from previously published microarrays (Nomaru et al., 2014Nomaru H. Sakumi K. Katogi A. Ohnishi Y.N. Kajitani K. Tsuchimoto D. Nestler E.J. Nakabeppu Y. Fosb gene products contribute to excitotoxic microglial activation by regulating the expression of complement C5a receptors in microglia.Glia. 2014; 62: 1284-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar; GEO: GSE40714). A statistical analysis by pairwise comparison demonstrated –log10-transformed and Bonferroni corrected p values between 33.8 and 35.6 for E13/14 cortex versus precursors and neurons, respectively, and of only 2.2 to 6.6 for microglia versus precursors and neurons (Figure S3A). As an additional control, we randomized the relative ligand orders. All of the Spearman rank correlations and their pairwise comparisons yielded values near zero (Figure S3B). We next overlaid the E13/14 cortex ligands on the communication models. This refinement removed 52 ligands from the transcriptome-based communication network, but the large majority of the predicted interactions were maintained (Figure 4C). In the transcriptome plus proteome-based network (Figure 4D), 67 of 75 potential ligands were validated. Thus, the cultured neurons and enriched precursors were predictive of the in vivo environment. One final potential caveat with this analysis is the relatively low percentage of intermediate progenitors in our precursor cultures versus the E13/14 cortex (5%–9% versus about 10%–20%, respectively). To ask whether this would impact our communication model, we extracted differentially expressed ligands and receptors from microarray data of the E14.5 cortex with or without intermediate progenitors due to conditional knockout of the Tbr2 gene (Nestin-Cre; EOMESfl/fl mice; Elsen et al., 2013Elsen G.E. Hodge R.D. Bedogni F. Daza R.A. Nelson B.R. Shiba N. Reiner S.L. Hevner R.F. The protomap is propagated to cortical plate neurons through an Eomes-dependent intermediate map.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 4081-4086Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar; GEO: GSE43387). Only three ligand and two receptor mRNAs were differentially expressed (p < 0.05 FDR) in the cortex without intermediate progenitors: Adcyap1 (2.8-fold increased), Angpt1 (4.2-fold increased), Fstl5 (1.6-fold increased), Sstr2 (0.5-fold decreased), and Nrp2 (1.8-fold increased). These ligands are included in our model, and these changes would have no impact on their inclusion. We tested our refined communication model, asking whether it could predict ligands that regulate neurogenesis by focusing on 15 ligands expressed in E13/14 cortex (Figures 4C and 4D; Table S10) but not previously characterized in this context. We examined eight ligands predicted by the integrated transcriptomic/proteomic model (Figure 5A) and seven predicted by the transcriptome model alone (Figure 5B). We plated E13 precursors in 96-well plates (50,000 cells/cm2) and added individual ligands at 100 ng/mL for 3 days. Immunostaining for βIII-tubulin and high-content image analysis (Figures 5C and 5D) showed that six ligands significantly increased newborn neurons: GDNF, Nrtn, macrophage inflammatory protein 1β (Mip1β, or CCL4), cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1 (CLCF1), IFNγ, and neuropeptide Y (NPY). We validated these results by adding these ligands individually or together in similar culture experiments and manually counting cells positive for βIII-tubulin and Ki67. All six individual factors enhanced neurogenesis (Figure 5E) and, with the exception of CLCF1, significantly decreased Ki67-positive proliferating precursors (Figure 5F). Moreover, the combined factors almost doubled βIII-tubulin-positive neurons, and decreased proliferating precursors by almost 3-fold, an effect greater than that with any individual factors (Figure 5G). Of the six validated ligands, four were from the combined transcriptome/proteome model. We"
https://openalex.org/W2508778749,"Shallow water provides important habitat for many species, but also exposes these organisms to daily fluctuations in dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH caused by cycles in the balance between photosynthesis and respiration that can contribute to repeated, brief periods of hypoxia and low pH (caused by elevated pCO2). The amplitude of these cycles, and the severity and duration of hypoxia and hypercapnia that result, can be increased by eutrophication, and are predicted to worsen with climate change. We conducted laboratory experiments to test the effects of both diel-cycling and constant low DO and pH (elevated pCO2) on growth of the juvenile eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica), an economically and ecologically important estuarine species. Severe diel-cycling hypoxia (to 0.5 mg O2 L-1) reduced shell growth in juvenile oysters, as did constant hypoxia (1.2 and 2.0 mg O2 L-1), although effects varied among experiments, oyster ages, and exposure durations. Diel-cycling pH reduced growth only in experiments in which calcite saturation state cycled to ≤0.10 and only during the initial weeks of these experiments. In other cases, cycling pH sometimes led to increased growth rates. Comparisons of treatment effects across multiple weeks of exposure, and during a longer post-experiment field deployment, indicated that juvenile oysters can acclimate to, and in some cases compensate for initial reductions in growth. As a result, some ecosystem services dependent on juvenile oyster growth rates may be preserved even under severe cycling hypoxia and pH."
https://openalex.org/W2510000649,"We present a computational model for trans-vascular oxygen transport in synthetic tumor and host tissue blood vessel networks, aiming at qualitatively explaining published data of optical mammography, which were obtained from 87 breast cancer patients. The data generally show average hemoglobin concentration to be higher in tumors versus host tissue whereas average oxy-to total hemoglobin concentration (vascular segment RBC-volume-weighted blood oxygenation) can be above or below normal. Starting from a synthetic arterio-venous initial network the tumor vasculature was generated by processes involving cooption, angiogenesis, and vessel regression. Calculations of spatially resolved blood flow, hematocrit, oxy- and total hemoglobin concentrations, blood and tissue oxygenation were carried out for ninety tumor and associated normal vessel networks starting from various assumed geometries of feeding arteries and draining veins. Spatial heterogeneity in the extra-vascular partial oxygen pressure distribution can be related to various tumor compartments characterized by varying capillary densities and blood flow characteristics. The reported higher average hemoglobin concentration of tumors is explained by growth and dilatation of tumor blood vessels. Even assuming sixfold metabolic rate of oxygen consumption in tumorous versus host tissue, the predicted oxygen hemoglobin concentrations are above normal. Such tumors are likely associated with high tumor blood flow caused by high-caliber blood vessels crossing the tumor volume and hence oxygen supply exceeding oxygen demand. Tumor oxy- to total hemoglobin concentration below normal could only be achieved by reducing tumor vessel radii during growth by a randomly selected factor, simulating compression caused by intra-tumoral solid stress due to proliferation of cells and extracellular matrix. Since compression of blood vessels will impede chemotherapy we conclude that tumors with oxy- to total hemoglobin concentration below normal are less likely to respond to chemotherapy. Such behavior was recently reported for neo-adjuvant chemotherapy of locally advanced breast tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2511308895,"A substantial proportion of the total infectious disease burden world-wide is due to person-to-person spread of pathogens within households. A questionnaire-based survey on the determinants of hand-washing with soap and cleaning of household surfaces was conducted in at least 1000 households in each of twelve countries across the world (N = 12,239). A structural equation model of hygiene behaviour and its consequences derived from theory was then estimated on this dataset for both behaviours, using a maximum likelihood procedure. The analysis showed that the frequency of handwashing with soap is significantly related to how automatically it is performed, and whether or not someone is busy, or tired. Surface cleaning was strongly linked to possessing a cleaning routine, the perception that one is living in a dirty environment and that others are doing the behaviour, whether one has a strong sense of contamination, as well as a felt need to keep one's surroundings tidy. Being concerned with good manners is also linked to the performance of both behaviours. This study is the first to identify the role of manners, orderliness and routine on hygiene behaviours globally. Such findings should prove helpful in designing programs to improve domestic hygiene practices."
https://openalex.org/W2514096019,"Proneural basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, Atoh1, plays a key role in the development of sensory hair cells. We show here that the level of Atoh1 must be accurately controlled by degradation of the protein in addition to the regulation of Atoh1 gene expression to achieve normal cellular patterning during development of the cochlear sensory epithelium. The stability of Atoh1 was regulated by the ubiquitin proteasome system through the action of Huwe1, a HECT-domain, E3 ubiquitin ligase. An interaction between Huwe1 and Atoh1 could be visualized by a proximity ligation assay and was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry. Transfer of a lysine 48-linked polyubiquitin chain to Atoh1 by Huwe1 could be demonstrated both in intact cells and in a cell-free system, and proteasome inhibition or Huwe1 silencing increased Atoh1 levels. The interaction with Huwe1 and polyubiquitylation were blocked by disruption of casein kinase 1 (CK1) activity, and mass spectrometry and mutational analysis identified serine 334 as an important phosphorylation site for Atoh1 ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation. Phosphorylation by CK1 thus targeted the protein for degradation. Development of an extra row of inner hair cells in the cochlea and an approximate doubling in the number of afferent synapses was observed after embryonic or early postnatal deletion of Huwe1 in cochlear-supporting cells, and hair cells died in the early postnatal period when Huwe1 was knocked out in the developing cochlea. These data indicate that the regulation of Atoh1 by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway is necessary for hair cell fate determination and survival."
https://openalex.org/W2509138701,"Neural circuits formed during postnatal development have to be maintained stably thereafter, but their mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here we report that the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 1 (mGluR1) is essential for the maintenance of mature synaptic connectivity in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). In mGluR1 knockout (mGluR1-KO) mice, strengthening and elimination at retinogeniculate synapses occurred normally until around postnatal day 20 (P20). However, during the subsequent visual-experience-dependent maintenance phase, weak retinogeniculate synapses were newly recruited. These changes were similar to those of wild-type (WT) mice that underwent visual deprivation or inactivation of mGluR1 in the dLGN from P21. Importantly, visual deprivation was ineffective in mGluR1-KO mice, and the changes induced by visual deprivation in WT mice were rescued by pharmacological activation of mGluR1 in the dLGN. These results demonstrate that mGluR1 is crucial for the visual-experience-dependent maintenance of mature synaptic connectivity in the dLGN."
https://openalex.org/W2517585410,"Glutamine-derived carbon becomes available for anabolic biosynthesis in cancer cells via the hydrolysis of glutamine to glutamate, as catalyzed by GAC, a splice variant of kidney-type glutaminase (GLS). Thus, there is significant interest in understanding the regulation of GAC activity, with the suggestion being that higher order oligomerization is required for its activation. We used x-ray crystallography, together with site-directed mutagenesis, to determine the minimal enzymatic unit capable of robust catalytic activity. Mutagenesis of the helical interface between the two pairs of dimers comprising a GAC tetramer yielded a non-active, GAC dimer whose x-ray structure displays a stationary loop (“activation loop”) essential for coupling the binding of allosteric activators like inorganic phosphate to catalytic activity. Further mutagenesis that removed constraints on the activation loop yielded a constitutively active dimer, providing clues regarding how the activation loop communicates with the active site, as well as with a peptide segment that serves as a “lid” to close off the active site following substrate binding. Our studies show that the formation of large GAC oligomers is not a pre-requisite for full enzymatic activity. They also offer a mechanism by which the binding of activators like inorganic phosphate enables the activation loop to communicate with the active site to ensure maximal rates of catalysis, and promotes the opening of the lid to achieve optimal product release. Moreover, these findings provide new insights into how other regulatory events might induce GAC activation within cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2514036669,"Tendinopathy is a big burden in clinics and it represents 45% of musculoskeletal lesions. Despite the relevant social impact, both pathogenesis and development of the tendinopathy are still under-investigated, thus limiting the therapeutic advancement in this field. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the dose-dependent and time-related tissue-level changes occurring in a collagenase-induced tendinopathy in rat Achilles tendons, in order to establish a standardized model for future pre-clinical studies. With this purpose, 40 Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into two groups, treated by injecting collagenase type I within the Achilles tendon at 1 mg/mL (low dose) or 3 mg/mL (high dose). Tendon explants were histologically evaluated at 3, 7, 15, 30 and 45 days. Our results revealed that both the collagenase doses induced a disorganization of collagen fibers and increased the number of rounded resident cells. In particular, the high dose treatment determined a greater neovascularization and fatty degeneration with respect to the lower dose. These changes were found to be time-dependent and to resemble the features of human tendinopathy. Indeed, in our series, the acute phase occurred from day 3 to day 15, and then progressed towards the proliferative phase from day 30 to day 45 displaying a degenerative appearance associated with a very precocious and mild remodeling process. The model represents a good balance between similarity with histological features of human tendinopathy and feasibility, in terms of tendon size to create lesions and costs when compared to other animal models. Moreover, this model could contribute to improve the knowledge in this field, and it could be useful to properly design further pre-clinical studies to test innovative treatments for tendinopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2516248496,"Although the organization of bone ultrastructure, i.e. the orientation and arrangement of the mineralized collagen fibrils, has been in the focus of research for many years for cortical bone, and many models on the osteonal arrangement have been proposed, limited attention has been paid to trabecular bone ultrastructure. This is surprising because trabeculae play a crucial role for the mechanical strength of several bone sites, including the vertebrae and the femoral head. On this account, we first validated a recently developed method (3D sSAXS or 3D scanning small-angle X-ray scattering) for investigating bone ultrastructure in a quantitative and spatially resolved way, using conventional linearly polarized light microscopy as a gold standard. While both methods are used to analyze thin tissue sections, in contrast to polarized light microscopy, 3D sSAXS has the important advantage that it provides 3D information on the orientation and arrangement of bone ultrastructure. In this first study of its kind, we used 3D sSAXS to investigate the ultrastructural organization of 22 vertebral trabeculae of different alignment, types and sizes, obtained from 4 subjects of different ages. Maps of ultrastructure orientation and arrangement of the trabeculae were retrieved by stacking information from consecutive 20-μm-thick bone sections. The organization of the ultrastructure was analyzed in relation to trabecular microarchitecture obtained from computed tomography and to relevant parameters such as distance to trabecular surface, local curvature or local bone mineralization. We found that (i) ultrastructure organization is similar for all investigated trabeculae independent of their particular characteristics, (ii) bone ultrastructure exhibiting a high degree of orientation was arranged in domains, (iii) highly oriented ultrastructural areas were located closer to the bone surface, (iv) the ultrastructure of the human trabecular bone specimens followed the microarchitecture, being oriented mostly parallel to bone surface, and (v) local surface curvature seems to have an effect on the ultrastructure organization. Further studies that investigate bone ultrastructure orientation and arrangement are needed in order to understand its organization and consequently its relation to bone biology and mechanics."
https://openalex.org/W2508377514,"Preterm birth represents a high risk of neurodevelopmental disabilities when associated with white-matter damage. Recent studies have reported cognitive deficits in children born preterm without brain injury on MRI at term-equivalent age. Understanding the microstructural and metabolic underpinnings of these deficits is essential for their early detection. Here, we used diffusion-weighted imaging and single-voxel 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to compare brain maturation at term-equivalent age in premature neonates with no evidence of white matter injury on conventional MRI except diffuse excessive high-signal intensity, and normal term neonates. Thirty-two infants, 16 term neonates (mean post-conceptional age at scan: 39.8±1 weeks) and 16 premature neonates (mean gestational age at birth: 29.1±2 weeks, mean post-conceptional age at scan: 39.2±1 weeks) were investigated. The MRI/MRS protocol performed at 1.5T involved diffusion-weighted MRI and localized 1H-MRS with the Point RESolved Spectroscopy (PRESS) sequence. Preterm neonates showed significantly higher ADC values in the temporal white matter (P<0.05), the occipital white matter (P<0.005) and the thalamus (P<0.05). The proton spectrum of the centrum semiovale was characterized by significantly lower taurine/H2O and macromolecules/H2O ratios (P<0.05) at a TE of 30 ms, and reduced (creatine+phosphocreatine)/H2O and (glutamine+glutamate)/H2O ratios (P<0.05) at a TE of 135 ms in the preterm neonates than in full-term neonates. Our findings indicate that premature neonates with normal conventional MRI present a delay in brain maturation affecting the white matter and the thalamus. Their brain metabolic profile is characterized by lower levels of creatine, glutamine plus glutamate, and macromolecules in the centrum semiovale, a finding suggesting altered energy metabolism and protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2510479884,"Purpose Neoadjuvant therapy is able to reduce local recurrence in rectal cancer. Immediate surgery after short course radiotherapy allows only for minimal downstaging. We investigated the effect of delayed surgery after short-course radiotherapy at different time intervals before surgery, in patients affected by rectal cancer. Methods From January 2003 to December 2013 sixty-seven patients with the following characteristics have been selected: clinical (c) stage T3N0 ≤ 12 cm from the anal verge and with circumferential resection margin > 5 mm (by magnetic resonance imaging); cT2, any N, < 5 cm from anal verge; and patients facing tumors with enlarged nodes and/or CRM+ve who resulted unfit for chemo-radiation, were also included. Patients underwent preoperative short-course radiotherapy with different interval to surgery were divided in three groups: A (within 6 weeks), B (between 6 and 8 weeks) and C (after more than 8 weeks). Hystopatolgical response to radiotherapy was measured by Mandard’s modified tumor regression grade (TRG). Results All patients completed the scheduled treatment. Sixty-six patients underwent surgery. Fifty-three of which (80.3%) received a sphincter saving procedure. Downstaging occurred in 41 cases (62.1%). The analysis of subgroups showed an increasing prevalence of TRG 1–2 prolonging the interval to surgery (group A—16.7%, group B—36.8% and 54.3% in group C; p value 0.023). Conclusions Preoperative short-course radiotherapy is able to downstage rectal cancer if surgery is delayed. A higher rate of TRG 1–2 can be obtained if interval to surgery is prolonged to more than 8 weeks."
https://openalex.org/W2516832875,"Moringa oleifera is a promising plant species for oil and forage, but its genetic improvement is limited. Our current breeding program in this species focuses on exploiting the functional genes associated with important agronomical traits. Here, we screened reliable reference genes for accurately quantifying the expression of target genes using the technique of real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in M. oleifera. Eighteen candidate reference genes were selected from a transcriptome database, and their expression stabilities were examined in 90 samples collected from the pods in different developmental stages, various tissues, and the roots and leaves under different conditions (low or high temperature, sodium chloride (NaCl)- or polyethyleneglycol (PEG)- simulated water stress). Analyses with geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper algorithms revealed that the reliable reference genes differed across sample designs and that ribosomal protein L1 (RPL1) and acyl carrier protein 2 (ACP2) were the most suitable reference genes in all tested samples. The experiment results demonstrated the significance of using the properly validated reference genes and suggested the use of more than one reference gene to achieve reliable expression profiles. In addition, we applied three isotypes of the superoxide dismutase (SOD) gene that are associated with plant adaptation to abiotic stress to confirm the efficacy of the validated reference genes under NaCl and PEG water stresses. Our results provide a valuable reference for future studies on identifying important functional genes from their transcriptional expressions via RT-qPCR technique in M. oleifera."
https://openalex.org/W2511820075,"The objective of this study was to describe prior negative screening history and symptoms around the time of diagnosis of incident cervical cancer (CC) cases diagnosed between 2000 and 2010 within the Asturias public health system.Records from 374 women diagnosed with CC between 2000 and 2010 from all public hospitals in Asturias were retrieved. Clinical information, FIGO stage and all previous cytological data were extracted from clinical and histopathological records. Proportional differences were assessed using chi-square tests. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Inter-observer agreement in cytology was checked by comparing concordance values using k-statistics.No prior screening history was recorded in 60.7% of CC cases and its absence increased with age and advanced stage. Advanced stage (e.g., ≥ II) at diagnosis was associated with age (>50 years) and adenocarcinoma (ADC) compared to younger women and those with a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). False negative smears were identified in 27.1% of women with CC (ADC 52.6% vs. SCC 16.2%, p<0.05).Absence of prior screening history was common among CC cases. Organized actions to reduce ""under screening"" and the use of highly sensitive HPV-based tests could be useful strategies in reducing the burden of CC in Asturias."
https://openalex.org/W2511987151,"Translational fidelity mediated by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases ensures the generation of the correct aminoacyl-tRNAs, which is critical for most species. Threonyl-tRNA synthetase (ThrRS) contains multiple domains, including an N2 editing domain. Of the ThrRS domains, N1 is the last to be assigned a function. Here, we found that ThrRSs from Mycoplasma species exhibit differences in their domain composition and editing active sites compared with the canonical ThrRSs. The Mycoplasma mobile ThrRS, the first example of a ThrRS naturally lacking the N1 domain, displays efficient post-transfer editing activity. In contrast, the Mycoplasma capricolum ThrRS, which harbors an N1 domain and a degenerate N2 domain, is editing-defective. Only editing-capable ThrRSs were able to support the growth of a yeast thrS deletion strain (ScΔthrS), thus suggesting that ScΔthrS is an excellent tool for studying the in vivo editing of introduced bacterial ThrRSs. On the basis of the presence or absence of an N1 domain, we further revealed the crucial importance of the only absolutely conserved residue within the N1 domain in regulating editing by mediating an N1-N2 domain interaction in Escherichia coli ThrRS. Our results reveal the translational quality control of various ThrRSs and the role of the N1 domain in translational fidelity."
https://openalex.org/W2512482307,"Increasing consumption of a high fat 'Western' diet has led to a growing number of pregnancies complicated by maternal obesity. Maternal overnutrition and obesity have health implications for offspring, yet little is known about their effects on offspring kidney development and renal function. Female C57Bl6 mice were fed a high fat diet (HFD, 21% fat) or matched normal fat diet (NFD, 6% fat) for 6 weeks prior to pregnancy and throughout gestation and lactation. HFD dams were overweight and glucose intolerant prior to mating but not in late gestation. Offspring of NFD and HFD dams had similar body weights at embryonic day (E)15.5, E18.5 and at postnatal day (PN)21. HFD offspring had normal ureteric tree development and nephron number at E15.5. However, using unbiased stereology, kidneys of HFD offspring were found to have 20-25% more nephrons than offspring of NFD dams at E18.5 and PN21. Offspring of HFD dams with body weight and glucose profiles similar to NFD dams prior to pregnancy also had an elevated nephron endowment. At 9 months of age, adult offspring of HFD dams displayed mild fasting hyperglycaemia but similar body weights to NFD offspring. Renal function and morphology, measured by transcutaneous clearance of FITC-sinistrin and stereology respectively, were normal. This study demonstrates that maternal fat feeding augments offspring nephron endowment with no long-term consequences for offspring renal health. Future studies assessing the effects of a chronic stressor on adult mice with augmented nephron number are warranted, as are studies investigating the molecular mechanisms that result in high nephron endowment."
https://openalex.org/W2515689100,"Both lower serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and elevated homocysteine concentrations are potential risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). A recent analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey reported an inverse association of serum 25(OH)D with homocysteine, however, the longitudinal relationship has yet to be investigated. We hypothesized and examined whether a temporal increase in 25(OH)D concentrations is paralleled by a reduction in the risk for elevated homocysteine. We analyzed data of 4475 participants with repeated assessments of serum 25(OH)D and homocysteine concentrations who enrolled in a preventive health program that encourages vitamin D supplementation and monitors serum 25(OH)D and homocysteine concentrations. We defined elevated homocysteine as concentrations greater than 13 micromoles per liter. Logistic regression was applied to assess the association of temporal changes in serum 25(OH)D with the risk of elevated homocysteine. We observed an inverse gradient whereby greater increases in 25(OH)D concentrations were associated with a lower prevalence of elevated homocysteine. Relative to those without temporal increases in 25(OH)D, participants who showed improvements in their serum 25(OH)D concentrations of ""<25"", ""25-50"", ""50-75"", and ""≥75"" nanomoles per liter at follow up were 0.92 (95% confidence interval: 0.62-1.37), 0.52 (0.33-0.80), 0.34 (0.20-0.58), and 0.32 (0.19-0.54) times as likely to have elevated homocysteine, respectively. These observations suggest that temporal improvements in vitamin D status reduce serum homocysteine concentrations, and therefore may potentially contribute to the primary prevention of CVD."
https://openalex.org/W2515708826,"Previous studies have demonstrated that β2-adrenergic receptors (β2ARs) can be phosphorylated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) and protein kinase A (PKA), affecting β2AR internalization and desensitization. However, the exact physiological function of β2ARs in cardiomyocytes is unknown. In this study, we showed that neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes had different contraction and internalization responses to sustained or repeated, transient agonist stimulation. Specifically, short-time stimulation (10 min) with epinephrine or norepinephrine increased the cardiomyocyte contraction rate, reaching a maximum at 5 min, followed by a slow decline. When the agonist was re-added after a 60-min wash-out period, the increase in the cardiomyocyte contraction rate was similar to the initial response. In contrast, when cardiomyocytes were exposed continuously to epinephrine or norepinephrine for 60 min, the second agonist stimulation did not increase the contraction response. These results indicated that continuous β2AR stimulation caused functional desensitization. Phosphorylation of β2ARs at serine (Ser)355/356 GRK phosphorylation sites, but not at Ser345/346 PKA phosphorylation sites increased with continuous epinephrine stimulation for 60 min. Accordingly, β2AR internalization increased. Interestingly, β2AR internalization was blocked by mutations at the GRK phosphorylation sites, but not by mutations at the PKA phosphorylation sites. Furthermore, inhibition of β2AR dephosphorylation by okadaic acid, a phosphatase 2A inhibitor, impaired the recovery of internalized β2ARs and reduced the cardiomyocyte contraction rate in response to epinephrine. Finally, epinephrine treatment induced the physical interaction of β-arrestin with internalized β2ARs in cardiomyocytes. Together, these data revealed the essential role of the Ser355/356 phosphorylation status of β2ARs in regulating receptor internalization and physiological resensitization in neonatal cardiomyocytes to contraction functions."
https://openalex.org/W2507789596,"A sequencing batch reactor fed mainly by acetate was operated to perform enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR). A short-term pH shock from 7.0 to 6.0 led to a complete loss of phosphate-removing capability and a drastic change of microbial communities. 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing showed that large proportions of glycogen accumulating organisms (GAOs) (accounted for 16% of bacteria) bloomed, including Candidatus Competibacter phosphatis and Defluviicoccus-related tetrad-forming organism, causing deteriorated EBPR performance. The EBPR performance recovered with time and the dominant Candidatus Accumulibacter (Accumulibacter) clades shifted from Clade IIC to IIA while GAOs populations shrank significantly. The Accumulibacter population variation provided a good opportunity for genome binning using a bi-dimensional coverage method, and a genome of Accumulibacter Clade IIC was well retrieved with over 90% completeness. Comparative genomic analysis demonstrated that Accumulibacter clades had different abilities in nitrogen metabolism and carbon fixation, which shed light on enriching different Accumulibacter populations selectively."
https://openalex.org/W2517006279,"Borealin, a member of the chromosomal passenger complex, plays a key regulatory role at centromeres and the central spindle during mitosis. Loss of Borealin leads to defective cell proliferation and early embryonic lethality. The in vivo functions of Borealin in mammalian postnatal development, tissue homeostasis, and tumorigenesis remain elusive. We specifically analyzed the role of Borealin in regulating postnatal liver development, damage-induced liver regeneration, and liver carcinogenesis using mice carrying conditional Borealin alleles. Perinatal loss of Borealin caused increased genome ploidy and enlarged cell size in hepatocytes, likely due to the impaired function of the chromosomal passenger complex in mitosis. Borealin deletion also showed attenuated expansion of Sox9+HNF4α+ progenitor-like cells in liver regeneration during 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine diet-induced liver injury. Moreover, ΔN90-β-Catenin and c-Met-induced hepatocarcinogenesis development was largely impeded by Borealin deletion. These findings indicate that Borealin plays a key role in liver development, regeneration, and tumorigenesis and suggests that Borealin could be a potential target for related liver diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2518280769,"Recent experimental evidence and theoretical models suggest that an integration of exteroceptive and interoceptive signals underlies several key aspects of the bodily self. While it has been shown that self-attribution of both the hand and the full-body are altered by conflicting extero-exteroceptive (e.g. visuo-tactile) and extero-interoceptive (e.g. visuo-cardiac) information, no study has thus far investigated whether self-attribution of the face might be altered by visuo-cardiac stimulation similarly to visuo-tactile stimulation. In three independent groups of participants we presented ambiguous (i.e. morphed with a stranger's face) self-faces flashing synchronously or asynchronously with the participants’ heartbeat. We then measured the subjective percentages of self-face attribution of morphed stimuli. To control for a potential effect of visuo-cardiac synchrony on familiarity, a task assessing the attribution of a familiar face was introduced. Moreover, different durations of visuo-cardiac flashing and different degrees of asynchronicity were used. Based on previous studies showing that synchronous visuo-cardiac stimulation generally increases self-attribution of the full-body and the hand, and that synchronous visuo-tactile stimulation increases self-face attribution, we predicted higher self-face attribution during the synchronous visuo-cardiac flashing of the morphed stimuli. In contrast to this hypothesis, the results showed no difference between synchronous and asynchronous stimulation on self-face attribution in any of the three studies. We thus conclude that visuo-cardiac synchrony does not boost self-attribution of the face as it does that of hand and full-body."
https://openalex.org/W2514334204,"Tobacco smoking by pregnant women has a negative effect on fetal development and increases pregnancy risk by changing the oxidative balance and microelements level. Smoking affects the concentration, structure and function of proteins, potentially leading to various negative effects on pregnancy outcomes.The influence of tobacco smoke on key protein fractions in smoking and non-smoking healthy pregnant women was determined by capillary electrophoresis (CE). Concentrations of the proteins α1-antitrypsin, α1-acid glycoprotein, α2-macroglobulin and transferrin were determined by ELISA tests. Total protein concentration was measured by the Biuret method. Smoking status was established by cotinine levels. Cadmium (Cd) and Zinc (Zn) concentrations were determined by flame atomic absorption spectrometry and the Zn/Cd ratio was calculated based on these numbers. Smoking women had a 3.7 times higher level of Cd than non-smoking women. Zn levels decreased during pregnancy for all women. The Zn/Cd ratio was three times lower in smoking women. The differences between the changes in the protein profile for smoking and non-smoking women were noted. Regarding proteins, α1-antitrypsin and α2-macroglobulin levels were lower in the non-smoking group than in the smoking group and correlated with Cd levels (r = -0.968, p = 0.032 for non-smokers; r = -0.835, p = 0.019 for smokers). Zn/Cd ratios correlated negatively with α1-, α2- and β-globulins.Exposure to tobacco smoke increases the concentration of Cd in the blood of pregnant women and may lead to an elevated risk of pregnancy disorders. During pregnancy alter concentrations of some proteins. The correlation of Cd with proteins suggests that it is one of the causes of protein aberrations."
https://openalex.org/W2512602317,"The secreted protein HbpS, the membrane-embedded sensor kinase SenS and the cytoplasmic response regulator SenR from streptomycetes have been shown to form a novel type of signaling pathway. Based on structural biology as well as different biochemical and biophysical approaches, redox stress-based post-translational modifications in the three proteins were shown to modulate the activity of this signaling pathway. In this study, we show that the homologous system, named here HbpSc-SenSc-SenRc, from the model species Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) provides this bacterium with an efficient defense mechanism under conditions of oxidative stress. Comparative analyses of the transcriptomes of the Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) wild-type and the generated hbpSc-senSc-senRc mutant under native and oxidative-stressing conditions allowed to identify differentially expressed genes, whose products may enhance the anti-oxidative defense of the bacterium. Amongst others, the results show an up-regulated transcription of genes for biosynthesis of cysteine and vitamin B12, transport of methionine and vitamin B12, and DNA synthesis and repair. Simultaneously, transcription of genes for degradation of an anti-oxidant compound is down-regulated in a HbpSc-SenSc-SenRc-dependent manner. It appears that HbpSc-SenSc-SenRc controls the non-enzymatic response of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) to counteract the hazardous effects of oxidative stress. Binding of the response regulator SenRc to regulatory regions of some of the studied genes indicates that the regulation is direct. The results additionally suggest that HbpSc-SenSc-SenRc may act in concert with other regulatory modules such as a transcriptional regulator, a two-component system and the Streptomyces B12 riboswitch. The transcriptomics data, together with our previous in vitro results, enable a profound characterization of the HbpS-SenS-SenR system from streptomycetes. Since homologues to HbpS-SenS-SenR are widespread in different actinobacteria with ecological and medical relevance, the data presented here will serve as a basis to elucidate the biological role of these homologues."
https://openalex.org/W2517415615,"In mammals, adenosine 3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) is known to play highly important roles in sperm motility and acrosomal exocytosis. It is known to act through protein phosphorylation via PRKA and through the activation of guanine nucleotide exchange factors like EPAC. Sperm intracellular cAMP levels depend on the activity of adenylyl cyclases, mostly SACY, though transmembrane-containing adenylyl cyclases are also present, and on the activity of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDE) whose role is to degrade cAMP into 5'-AMP. The PDE superfamily is subdivided into 11 families (PDE1 to 11), which act on either cAMP or cGMP, or on both cAMP and cGMP although with different enzymatic properties. PDE10, which is more effective on cAMP than cGMP, has been known for almost 15 years and is mostly studied in the brain where it is associated with neurological disorders. Although a high level of PDE10A gene expression is observed in the testis, information on the identity of the isoforms or on the cell type that express the PDE10 protein is lacking. The objective of this study was to identify the PDE10A isoforms expressed in the testis and germ cells, and to determine the presence and localization of PDE10A in mature spermatozoa. As a sub-objective, since PDE10A transcript variants were reported strictly through analyses of bovine genomic sequence, we also wanted to determine the nucleotide and amino acid sequences by experimental evidence. Using RT-PCR, 5'- and 3'-RACE approaches we clearly show that PDE10A transcript variants X3 and X5 are expressed in bovine testis as well as in primary spermatocytes and spermatids. We also reveal using a combination of immunological techniques and proteomics analytical tools that the PDE10A isoform X4 is present in the area of the developing acrosome of spermatids and of the acrosome of mature spermatozoa."

Here we describe non-proprietary 'RMCE-in' cell lines as an alternative to the 'Flp-in' system and cell lines. RMCE-in cell lines offer a number of advantages including increased efficiency of integration of the genetic element of interest (GEI) at a single docking site, lack of bacterial backbone at the docking site both before and after GEI integration, removal of selection and visual markers initially present at the docking site upon GEI integration and the possibility to validate GEI integration by loss of a red fluorescence reporter. Moreover, the RMCE-in cell lines are compatible with GEI donors used for the Flp-in system. We demonstrate a three-step procedure for generating RMCE-in cell lines, (I) RMCE-in transposon and SB10 transposase transfection, (II) clone isolation, and (III) selecting single integrated clones with highest RFP level, which could in principle be used to turn any cell line into an RMCE-in cell line. The RMCE-in system was used as a proof of concept to produce three new RMCE-in cell lines using HEK293, HeLa, and murine embryonic stem (mES) cells.
