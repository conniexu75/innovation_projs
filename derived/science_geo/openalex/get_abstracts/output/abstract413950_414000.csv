https://openalex.org/W2074948025,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is an age-dependent neurodegenerative disease characterized by the formation of β-amyloid (Aβ)-containing senile plaque. The disease could be induced by the administration of Aβ peptide, which was also known to upregulate inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and stimulate neuronal apoptosis. The present study is aimed to elucidate the cellular effect of resveratrol, a natural phytoestrogen with neuroprotective activities, on Aβ-induced hippocampal neuron loss and memory impairment. On adult Sprague-Dawley rats, we found the injection of Aβ could result in a significant impairment in spatial memory, a marked increase in the cellular level of iNOS and lipid peroxidation, and an apparent decrease in the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). By combining the treatment with Aβ, resveratrol was able to confer a significant improvement in spatial memory, and protect animals from Aβ-induced neurotoxicity. These neurological protection effects of resveratrol were associated with a reduction in the cellular levels of iNOS and lipid peroxidation and an increase in the production of HO-1. Moreover, the similar neurological and cellular response were also observed when Aβ treatment was combined with the administration of a NOS inhibitor, N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME). These findings strongly implicate that iNOS is involved in the Aβ-induced lipid peroxidation and HO-1 downregulation, and resveratrol protects animals from Aβ-induced neurotoxicity by suppressing iNOS production."
https://openalex.org/W2143868350,"Recent research has uncovered a remarkable ability to manipulate and control electromagnetic fields to produce effects such as perfect imaging and spatial cloaking. To achieve spatial cloaking, the index of refraction is manipulated to flow light from a probe around an object in such a way that a 'hole' in space is created, and the object remains hidden. Alternatively, it may be desirable to cloak the occurrence of an event over a finite time period, and the idea of temporal cloaking has been proposed in which the dispersion of the material is manipulated in time, producing a 'time hole' in the probe beam to hide the occurrence of the event from the observer. This approach is based on accelerating the front part of a probe light beam and slowing down its rear part to create a well controlled temporal gap--inside which an event occurs--such that the probe beam is not modified in any way by the event. The probe beam is then restored to its original form by the reverse manipulation of the dispersion. Here we present an experimental demonstration of temporal cloaking in an optical fibre-based system by applying concepts from the space-time duality between diffraction and dispersive broadening. We characterize the performance of our temporal cloak by detecting the spectral modification of a probe beam due to an optical interaction and show that the amplitude of the event (at the picosecond timescale) is reduced by more than an order of magnitude when the cloak is turned on. These results are a significant step towards the development of full spatio-temporal cloaking."

In the present study, the formation of these conserved structures in mammalian cells and functions linked to these structures were examined.Distinct cytoplasmic rods (∼3-10 µm in length) and rings (∼2-5 µm in diameter) in HEp-2 cells were initially observed in immunofluorescence using human autoantibodies. Co-localization studies revealed that, although RR had filament-like features, they were not enriched in actin, tubulin, or vimentin, and not associated with centrosomes or other known cytoplasmic structures. Further independent studies revealed that two key enzymes in the nucleotide synthetic pathway cytidine triphosphate synthase 1 (CTPS1) and inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2) were highly enriched in RR. CTPS1 enzyme inhibitors 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine and Acivicin as well as the IMPDH2 inhibitor Ribavirin exhibited dose-dependent induction of RR in >95% of cells in all cancer cell lines tested as well as mouse primary cells. RR formation by lower concentration of Ribavirin was enhanced in IMPDH2-knockdown HeLa cells whereas it was inhibited in GFP-IMPDH2 overexpressed HeLa cells. Interestingly, RR were detected readily in untreated mouse embryonic stem cells (>95%); upon retinoic acid differentiation, RR disassembled in these cells but reformed when treated with Acivicin.RR formation represented response to disturbances in the CTP or GTP synthetic pathways in cancer cell lines and mouse primary cells and RR are the convergence physical structures in these pathways. The availability of specific markers for these conserved structures and the ability to induce formation in vitro will allow further investigations in structure and function of RR in many biological systems in health and diseases."

The precise duplication of this organelle at each cell cycle ensures proper organization of the mitotic apparatus and chromosome segregation. However, centrosomes are dispensable for cell division during some stages of development in mouse and Drosophila . Bornens (p. 422 ) reviews the role of the centrosome in a variety of organisms and discusses how and why they can be dispensed with on occasion. In this vein, Azimzadeh et al. (p. 461 , published online 5 January) now demonstrate that centrosomes in Planarian flatworms, best known for their remarkable regeneration abilities, are completely dispensable for both cell division and development."

https://openalex.org/W2027975420,"In obesity and diabetes, adipocytes show significant endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which triggers a series of responses. This study aimed to investigate the lipolysis response to ER stress in rat adipocytes. Thapsigargin, tunicamycin, and brefeldin A, which induce ER stress through different pathways, efficiently activated a time-dependent lipolytic reaction. The lipolytic effect of ER stress occurred with elevated cAMP production and protein kinase A (PKA) activity. Inhibition of PKA reduced PKA phosphosubstrates and attenuated the lipolysis. Although both ERK1/2 and JNK are activated during ER stress, lipolysis is partially suppressed by inhibiting ERK1/2 but not JNK and p38 MAPK and PKC. Thus, ER stress induces lipolysis by activating cAMP/PKA and ERK1/2. In the downstream lipolytic cascade, phosphorylation of lipid droplet-associated protein perilipin was significantly promoted during ER stress but attenuated on PKA inhibition. Furthermore, ER stress stimuli did not alter the levels of hormone-sensitive lipase and adipose triglyceride lipase but caused Ser-563 and Ser-660 phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase and moderately elevated its translocation from the cytosol to lipid droplets. Accompanying these changes, total activity of cellular lipases was promoted to confer the lipolysis. These findings suggest a novel pathway of the lipolysis response to ER stress in adipocytes. This lipolytic activation may be an adaptive response that regulates energy homeostasis but with sustained ER stress challenge could contribute to lipotoxicity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance because of persistently accelerated free fatty acid efflux from adipocytes to the bloodstream and other tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2067168610,"An intensive recent effort to develop ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors has resulted in several potent and selective molecules such as Torin1, PP242, KU63794, and WYE354. These inhibitors are being widely used as pharmacological probes of mTOR-dependent biology. To determine the potency and specificity of these agents, we have undertaken a systematic kinome-wide effort to profile their selectivity and potency using chemical proteomics and assays for enzymatic activity, protein binding, and disruption of cellular signaling. Enzymatic and cellular assays revealed that all four compounds are potent inhibitors of mTORC1 and mTORC2, with Torin1 exhibiting ∼20-fold greater potency for inhibition of Thr-389 phosphorylation on S6 kinases (EC50 = 2 nm) relative to other inhibitors. In vitro biochemical profiling at 10 μm revealed binding of PP242 to numerous kinases, although WYE354 and KU63794 bound only to p38 kinases and PI3K isoforms and Torin1 to ataxia telangiectasia mutated, ATM and Rad3-related protein, and DNA-PK. Analysis of these protein targets in cellular assays did not reveal any off-target activities for Torin1, WYE354, and KU63794 at concentrations below 1 μm but did show that PP242 efficiently inhibited the RET receptor (EC50, 42 nm) and JAK1/2/3 kinases (EC50, 780 nm). In addition, Torin1 displayed unusually slow kinetics for inhibition of the mTORC1/2 complex, a property likely to contribute to the pharmacology of this inhibitor. Our results demonstrated that, with the exception of PP242, available ATP-competitive compounds are highly selective mTOR inhibitors when applied to cells at concentrations below 1 μm and that the compounds may represent a starting point for medicinal chemistry efforts aimed at developing inhibitors of other PI3K kinase-related kinases.

Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) 4The abbreviations used are: mTORmammalian target of rapamycinPIKKPI3K-like kinaseATMataxia telangiectasia mutatedATRATM and Rad3-related proteinS6KS6 kinase. is a serine/threonine kinase that is highly conserved across eukaryotic cells and controls several fundamental cellular functions (1Guertin D.A.

Two adenovirus mRNAs have a common 5′-terminal leader sequence encoded at least 10 kb upstream from their main coding regions.Cancer Cell. 2007; 12: 9-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar). mTOR is a master regulator of cellular growth and proliferation and functions as a component of the PI3K/Akt/TSC/mTOR/S6K (4EBP) signal transduction pathway. mTOR is found in at least two distinct multiprotein complexes, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). mTORC1 is composed of the mTOR kinase and four associated proteins, Raptor, mLST8, PRAS40, and DEPTOR. mTORC2 also contains mTOR, mLST8, and DEPTOR, but instead of Raptor and PRAS40, it contains Rictor, mSin1, and Protor. mTORC1 controls cell growth in part by phosphorylating S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and eIF-4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), key regulators of protein synthesis (2Hara K.

Deregulation of the PI3K/Akt/TSC/mTOR pathway is common in human tumors, and this has provided the impetus to develop mTOR inhibitors as a new class of anti-cancer drugs (5Liu P. Cheng H.

Rapamycin, originally discovered as an antifungal agent with immunosuppressant properties, is an allosteric inhibitor of mTORC1 that acts by recruiting an accessory protein named FKBP-12 to the FRB domain of mTOR; this down-regulates mTOR kinase activity through an as-yet unknown mechanism (6Sabers C.J.

Rapamycin has demonstrated clinical efficacy in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma and mantle cell lymphoma (7Lane H.A. Breuleux M. Optimal targeting of the mTORC1 kinase in human cancer.Curr.

This might reflect the fact that treatment of cells with rapamycin generally causes partial inhibition of mTORC1 (8Thoreen C.C. Kang S.A. Chang J.W. Liu Q. Zhang J. Gao Y. Reichling L.J. Sim T.

Several of these compounds have been advanced to phase I clinical investigation, including OSI027, AZD8055, WYE125132, and INK128. To better understand the pharmacological effects of treating cells with mTOR inhibitors, we selected four structurally diverse compounds (Torin1, PP242, KU63794, and WYE354) for kinome-wide selectivity profiling using three complementary approaches as follows: radio-enzymatic assays of 97 recombinant kinases (at the Medical Research Council Phosphorylation Unit), binding to 442 recombinant kinases (using DiscoveRx KinomeScanTM), and chemical proteomics in cellular lysate (involving assays for 121 kinases, using KiNativ methods developed by ActiveX BioSciences). Potential targets other than mTOR identified by these methods were further investigated using cellular assays. Torin1, WYE354, KU63794, and PP242 were prepared following published procedures.

Cells were pretreated for 10 min with 10-fold stock solutions of inhibitors and treated with 10-fold stock solutions of epidermal growth factor, heregulin, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, or interleukin 6 (all PeproTech) for 10 min. Cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and washed with PBS-T (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20). Cells were then permeabilized in methanol for 10 min at room temperature, washed with PBS-T, and blocked in Odyssey blocking buffer (LI-COR Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature. Next, cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit antibody specific for Ser(P)-473 AKT, Thr(P)-308 AKT, Thr(P)-202/Tyr(P)-204 ERK1/2, or Tyr(P)-701 STAT1 (Cell Signaling Technology) diluted 1:400 in Odyssey blocking buffer (Licor). Cells were then washed three times in PBS-T and incubated with rabbit-specific secondary antibody labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 (Invitrogen) diluted 1:2000 in Odyssey blocking buffer. Cells were washed once in PBS-T and once in PBS and incubated in 250 ng/ml Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen) and 1:1000 Whole Cell Stain (blue; Thermo Scientific) solution for 15 min. Cells were then washed two times with PBS and imaged in an imageWoRx high throughput microscope (Applied Precision). The average data and standard deviations of six experiments were plotted using DataPflex (24Hendriks B.S. Espelin C.W. DataPflex. A MATLAB-based tool for the manipulation and visualization of multidimensional datasets.Bioinformatics. 2010; 26: 432-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were seeded in 6-well plates (0.5 × 106/well) and grown overnight. After 1 h of pretreatment with appropriate compounds at 37 °C, the culture media were removed and saved. For the ATR assay, cells were treated with 50 mJ of UV radiation energy using a Stratalinker (10 gray ionizing radiation for the ATM and DNA-PK assays). The culture media were added back to cells, and they were incubated at 37 °C. After 1 h, cells rinsed once with ice-cold PBS were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (40 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm pyrophosphate, 10 mm glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 tablet of EDTA-free protease inhibitors per 25 ml). The soluble fractions of cellular lysates were then separated from cellular debris by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min in a microcentrifuge. After the lysates from all plates were collected, the concentration of the protein was normalized by using Bradford assays. 50 μl of sample buffer was added to the normalized lysates and boiled for 5 min. The samples were subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Ba/F3 derivatives expressing various oncogenic fusion kinases, namely TEL-JAK1, TEL-JAK2, TEL-JAK3, and TEL-ABL, were described previously (25Lacronique V. Boureux A. Monni R. Dumon S. Mauchauffé M.

The cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma). For cell viability assays, the cells were incubated (density of 5000 cells per well in 96-well plates) in the presence of graded doses of small molecule inhibitors for 72 h. The number of viable cells was determined with the CellTiter Glo assay (Promega, Madison, WI). The 50% growth inhibition (GI50) values with an inhibitor for each cell line were calculated by nonlinear regression using GraphPad Prism software (La Jolla, CA). Mouse liver half-life was evaluated at Scripps Research Institute, Jupiter, FL. Microsome stability was determined by incubating 1 μm test compound with 1 mg/ml mouse hepatic microsomes in 100 mm KPi at pH 7.4. The reaction was initiated by adding NADPH (1 mm final concentration). Aliquots were removed at 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 60 min and added to acetonitrile (5× v/v) to stop the reaction and precipitate proteins. The NADPH dependence of the reaction was evaluated using NADPH-free samples. At the end of the assay, the samples were centrifuged through a Millipore Multiscreen Solvinter 0.45-micron low binding PTFE hydrophilic filter plate and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. The data were log transformed, and regression analysis was used to calculate the half-life values. mTORC1 was incubated with inhibitors (0.5 μm, 1% DMSO) in 5 μl of 1× reaction buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, and 4 mm MnCl2) for 40 min at room temperature. Then drug-ATP competition was induced by the addition of 245 μl of 1× reaction buffer containing 500 μm ATP and 0.4 μm GFP-4EBP1 (Invitrogen). The reaction mixture was dispensed (10 μl, in triplicate) into a low volume black plate (Corning Glass), and the kinase reaction was stopped at various times with 5 μl of stop solution (Invitrogen) containing 30 mm EDTA. Stop solution (5 μl) containing 4 nm terbium-labeled p-4EBP1 (T46) antibody (Invitrogen) was added, and the FRET signal was read using Envision (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) after 30 min of incubation. HeLa or PC3-S473D cells were seeded in 6-well plates (0.25 × 106/well) and grown overnight. Cells were then treated with the appropriate compounds for 1 h. After 1 h, except for the 0-h plate, the plates were washed of inhibitors with 1 ml/well culture media. Cells were then lysed in regular time intervals of 1, 2, 4, 6, and 16 h. The cells were rinsed once with ice-cold PBS and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (40 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm pyrophosphate, 10 mm glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 tablet of EDTA-free protease inhibitors per 25 ml). The soluble fractions of cell lysates were isolated by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min in a microcentrifuge. After lysates from all of the plates were collected, the concentration of the protein was normalized using the Bradford assay. 50 μl of sample buffer was added to the normalized lysates, which were then boiled for 5 min. Samples were subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. To directly compare the relative potency of the four inhibitors, we determined biochemical IC50 values using both a recombinant mTOR kinase domain and an intact mTORC1 complex purified from mammalian cells. All four compounds exhibited highly potent and similar IC50 values against the recombinant mTOR kinase domain. However, using the purified mTORC1 complex 1, Torin1 was the most potent compound by a factor of ∼20–70-fold (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. 1). To establish relative cellular potency, we examined the EC50 values for inhibition of S6 kinase Thr-389 phosphorylation, a residue well established to be modified directly by mTORC1. In this assay, Torin1 exhibited an EC50 of 2 nm, ∼10–20-fold more potent than the other inhibitors. These results demonstrate that assays using purified mTORC1 complexes more accurately reflect the cellular potency of mTOR inhibitors as compared with assays using the recombinant mTOR kinase domain.TABLE 1In vitro characterization of mTOR inhibitorsEntrymTOR-recombinant, IC50mTORC1 complex, IC50mTOR (HeLa), EC50nmnmnmTorin14.312PP24213.724.740KU637948.5735.430WYE35415.877.120 Open table in a new tab Next we evaluated kinase selectivity against a panel of 97 recombinant protein kinases (Fig. 2A, Table 2, and supplemental Table 1). At a concentration of 10 μm, Torin1, KU63794, and WYE354 were not observed to inhibit any protein kinase in the panel (at using a threshold of 50% inhibition relative to a DMSO-only control), whereas 10 μm PP242 exhibited strong (90%) inhibition of a number of kinases in the tyrosine kinase family/TK (including BTK, Eph, FGF receptor, VEGF receptor, Src, LCK, and YES), calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase family/CAMK (BRSK2, CHK2, and MLCK), CMGC family (DYK2/3, HIPK2 CDK, MAPK, GSK3, CLK, and ERK8), casein kinase family (CK1δ), and AGC family (PKCα). The relative lack of selectivity of PP242 can be rationalized based on the fact that its binding mode and scaffold are most similar to ATP and its structural similarity to PP1, a relatively nonselective inhibitor of Src family kinases.TABLE 2mTOR inhibitors in the Medical Research Council protein kinase panelFamilyKinaseTorin1PP242KU63694WYE354TKBTK56 ± 05 ± 281 ± 2199 ± 6EPHA287 ± 03 ± 096 ± 2104 ± 2EPHB394 ± 65 ± 478 ± 4116 ± 11FGF-R179 ± 82 ± 087 ± 10109 ± 3LCK78 ± 44 ± 091 ± 291 ± 2Src52 ± 52 ± 186 ± 567 ± 2VEG-FR84 ± 62 ± 192 ± 888 ± 10YES178 ± 3−8 ± 1590 ± 1113 ± 3CAMKBRSK2104 ± 74 ± 272 ± 788 ± 8CHK283 ± 42 ± 096 ± 988 ± 3MLCKN.D.6 ± 1104 ± 1391 ± 2CMGCDYRK299 ± 167 ± 296 ± 1296 ± 8DYRK352 ± 32 ± 184 ± 177 ± 1HIPK288 ± 67 ± 189 ± 194 ± 6ERK846 ± 76 ± 092 ± 598 ± 1CK1CK1δ104 ± 09 ± 1109 ± 1292 ± 6AGCPKCα68 ± 39 ± 286 ± 1875 ± 1 Open table in a new tab The four mTOR inhibitors were also subjected to binding assays at a screening concentration of 10 μm using the KinomeScanTM approach, which tests for association with 442 distinct kinases (Fig. 2B, Table 3, and supplemental Table 2). The results were consistent with the biochemical profiling (Fig. 2A and Table 2). PP242 strongly inhibited a number of TK family kinases (ABL, FLT, JAK, KIT, LCK, PDGF receptor, and RET), TKL family kinases (ACVR1/2 and BMPR), CAMK family kinases (BRSK2, MLCK, and PIM2), CMGC family kinases (HIPKs), STE family kinases (LOK, GCK, MEK1/2/5, SLK, TAO1, and YSK4), AGC family kinases (DMPK, MRCKα, PKCϵ, MSK2, and RSK2), PI3K family kinases (PI3Kβ/δ/γ), and CK1 family kinases (CSNK1E). In contrast, Torin1, KU63794, and WYE354 were much more selective. Torin1 exhibited strong off-target binding to MRCKa in the AGC family and PI3Kα in the PIKK family. KU63794 had the most selective profile and did not appear to bind any protein kinases other than mTOR. The only strong off-target binding by KU63794 involved the I800L mutant form of PI3Kα. WYE354 also bound to PI3K-I800L as well as p38 β/γ. Off-target binding of mTOR inhibitors to members of the PI3K family was expected because the mTOR shares a high level of sequence identity to PI3K family members in the kinase catalytic domain. Off-target effects are most easily visualized with respect to a kinome dendrogram (Fig. 3). All four mTOR inhibitors exhibited greater potency against the PI3Kα-I800L as compared with wild-type PI3Kα (Table 4) by KinomeScan profiling, but follow-on determination of Kd values did not confirm this result. For example, cellular assays examining the inhibition of Akt phosphorylation by mTOR in human mammary endothelial cells (HMECs) expressing PI3Kα-I800L did not reveal significant activity against this target at 1 μm drug (data not shown).TABLE 3mTOR inhibitors in KinomeScanTM kinase panelFamilyKinaseTorin1PP242KU63794WYE354TKABL1(E255K)850.1100100ABL1(H396P)np68010091ABL1(H396P)p810.05100100ABL1(Q252H)np890.0583100ABL1(Q252H)p990.27194ABL1(T315I)p1000.95100100ABL1(Y253F)p830.110090ABL1np600.759884ABL1p770.0599100ERBB344085100FLT4740.310092JAK1760.210074JAK2650.957173JAK31000100100KIT590.887100KIT(L576P)480.893100KIT(V559D)500.39096LCK770.959888PDGFRB24095100RET4409193RET(M918T)51010087TKLACVR1280.1100100ACVR2A470.5100100BMPR1B1000.19978BMPR2850.19978CAMKBRSK2760.9598100MYLK870.95781PIM2620.6100100CMGCHIPK2580.95865HIPK3860.97672P38δ3997710P38γ71591000STELOK790.592100MAP4K235086100MEK11000.25100100MEK21000.492100MEK51000.35100100SLK940.29870TAOK1580.28383YSK438010075AGCDMPK770.5586100MRCKA0.657492100PRKCE8608294RPS6KA410009588RSK2380.359976PI3KmTOR0000PIK3CA(C420R)0.7302.33PIK3CA(E545K)0.62124.9PIK3CA(I800L)01.600.4PIK3CB6503042PIK3CD5100.9540PIK3CG1.20.552378CK1CSNK1E590.18772 Open table in a new tab TABLE 4Comparison of mTOR inhibitor sensitivity to PI3Kα versus PI3Kα (I800L)EntryPI3Kα (Ambit Score)PI3Kα (I800L) (Ambit score)PI3Kα (Kd, nm)PI3Kα (I800L) (Kd, nm)Torin11.302314PP242321.6200230KU637942.507157WYE3545.40.4140190 Open table in a new tab Given the structural similarities among PIKK family members, we subjected mTOR inhibitors to ActivX KiNativTM kinase target profiling, a method that has the most extensive coverage of PIKK family members (Fig. 2C, Table 5, and supplemental Table 3).

PP242 exhibited potent protection of all PIKK family members (ATM, ATR, PI3Ks, DNA-PK, and SMG1), lipid kinase (PIP5K3), as well as some protein kinases in the CMGC, AGC, and STE families, confirming earlier results with recombinant kinase assays. Torin1 strongly inhibited ATM, ATR, PI3Kα, and DNA-PK in the PIKK family.

SelectScreen® is a FRET-based technology using fluorescence signal change as readout to detect inhibition of small molecules against protein kinases. PP242 exhibited a low IC50 value against PI3K-C2β, PI3Kδ, and DNA-PK (IC50 <100 nm) and moderate IC50 values for PI3K-C2α, PI3Kα, PI3Kβ, and PI3Kγ (IC50 ∼100–1000 nm). Torin1 was a potent inhibitor of DNA-PK (IC50 ∼6.3 nm) and moderate inhibitor of PI3K-C2α, PI3K-C2β, hVPS34, PI3Kα, PI3Kδ, and PI3Kγ. Both KU63794 and WYE354 were very selective against the PIKKs, and exhibited no activity against PI4K, group II PI3K, and group III PI3K. They only weakly inhibited PI3Kα and PI3Kδ in the group I PI3K subfamily(IC50, 100–1000 nm), and neither of them had apparent activity against PI3Kβ, PI3Kγ, or DNA-PK.TABLE 6mTOR inhibitors"
https://openalex.org/W1963960661,"The structural basis for molecular chaperones to discern misfolded proteins has long been an enigma. As the endoplasmic reticulum paralogue of the cytosolic HSP90, gp96 (GRP94, HSP90b1) is an essential molecular chaperone for Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and integrins. However, little is known about its client-binding domain (CBD). Herein, we provide genetic and biochemical evidence to definitively demonstrate that a C-terminal loop structure, formed by residues 652-678, is the critical region of CBD for both TLRs and integrins. Deletion of this region affects neither the intrinsic ATPase activity nor the overall conformation of gp96. However, without it, the chaperoning function of gp96 collapses. We also find a critical Met pair (Met(658)-Met(662)) for the folding of integrins but not TLRs. Moreover, we find that the TLR binding to gp96 is also dependent on the C-terminal dimerization domain but not the N-terminal ATP-binding pocket of gp96. Our study has unveiled surprisingly the exquisite specificity of gp96 in substrate binding and suggests a manipulation of its CBD as an alternative strategy for targeted therapy of a variety of diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2061241822,"Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a highly pathogenic arthropod-borne virus infecting a wide range of vertebrate hosts. Of particular interest is the nonstructural NSs protein, which forms large filamentous fibril bundles in the nucleus. Past studies have shown NSs to be a multifaceted protein important for virulence through modulation of the interferon response as well acting as a general inhibitor of transcription. Here we investigated the regulation of the DNA damage signaling cascades by RVFV infection and found virally inducted phosphorylation of the classical DNA damage signaling proteins, ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) (Ser-1981), Chk.2 (Thr-68), H2A.X (Ser-139), and p53 (Ser-15). In contrast, ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related kinase (ATR) (Ser-428) phosphorylation was decreased following RVFV infection. Importantly, both the attenuated vaccine strain MP12 and the fully virulent strain ZH548 showed strong parallels in their up-regulation of the ATM arm of the DNA damage response and in the down-regulation of the ATR pathway. The increase in DNA damage signaling proteins did not result from gross DNA damage as no increase in DNA damage was observed following infection. Rather the DNA damage signaling was found to be dependent on the viral protein NSs, as an NSs mutant virus was not found to induce the equivalent signaling pathways. RVFV MP12-infected cells also displayed an S phase arrest that was found to be dependent on NSs expression. Use of ATM and Chk.2 inhibitors resulted in a marked decrease in S phase arrest as well as viral production.

Elliott R.M. Antigenic drift, antigenic shift and interferon antagonists: how bunyaviruses counteract the immune system.Virus Res. 2002; 88: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Recent outbreaks have resulted in significant human mortality rates and an increased geographic footprint, escaping continental Africa into Mozambique, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen, demonstrating its capacity to cross significant geographical barriers and emerge into new regions (2.Pepin M.

Res. 2010; 41: 61Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Because of its increasing spread, host susceptibility, vector plasticity, and ease of aerosolization, RVFV has been listed as an emerging infectious disease and a category A select agent by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There is very real concern of its possible spread into Europe and the United States (2.Pepin M. Bouloy M. Bird B.H. Kemp A. Paweska J.

Despite being recognized as an emerging threat, the development of efficacious therapeutics against RVFV is hampered in part by limited knowledge of the mechanisms underlying pathogenesis at the molecular level.

RVFV contains a tripartite single-stranded RNA genome composed of the L, M, and S segments encoding viral polymerase (L), two glycoproteins (M), and the viral nucleocapsid (S). Additionally, two nonstructural proteins, NSm1 and NSm2, are encoded by the (M) segment, and the nonstructural NSs protein is encoded on the (S) segment (3.Bouloy M. Weber F.

NSs is unique among bunyaviruses in its ability to form filamentous structures in the nucleus. Although NSs filaments appear to be mostly separate from cellular DNA, there is strong evidence showing heterochromatin satellite clusters intimately associated with NSs filaments, likely resulting in a high incidence of nuclear anomalies and known chromosome cohesion and segregation defects (14.Mansuroglu Z.

Interaction of virus-encoded proteins with host cells plays an important role in viral infection and consequential pathogenesis, often working to bypass traditional defenses such as the interferon response and apoptosis. More recent studies have shown that this antiviral arsenal also includes highly conserved cellular DNA damage response (DDR) mechanisms. Viruses have developed ways to inhibit or circumvent the host's responses as well as methods to hijack cellular DNA repair proteins to aid in their own replication (15.Li R. Hayward S.D.

Many DNA viruses and retroviruses induce DNA damage through tethering or integration of their genome into the host DNA (16.Lilley C.E. Schwartz R.A.

In addition, it has been suggested that cellular DNA repair mechanisms are able to recognize nuclear viral genetic material as damage (17.Nikitin P.A. Yan C.M. Forte E. Bocedi A. Tourigny J.P.

Interestingly, a small number of RNA viruses that replicate exclusively in the cytoplasm have been shown to induce a DDR, including hepatitis C virus (HCV) and La Crosse virus (18.Machida K.

HCV induces the DDR through the viral proteins E6 and E7, producing an environment conducive to viral genomic replication through cell cycle arrest by activation of the DDR (20.Munakata T. Liang Y. Kim S. McGivern D.R. Huibregtse J. Nomoto A. Lemon S.M. Hepatitis C virus induces E6AP-dependent degradation of the retinoblastoma protein.PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: 1335-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). HCV has also been shown to cause DNA double strand breaks through its two viral proteins E1 and NS3 through induction of reactive oxygen species (21.Machida K. Cheng K.T. Lai C.K. Jeng K.S. Sung V.M.

Virol. 2006; 80: 7199-7207Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The DNA damage response for La Crosse virus is less well understood. It involves the phosphorylation of histone H2A.X and the proteasomal degradation of RNA polymerase II, lending itself to a transcriptional stress response model (19.Verbruggen P. Ruf M. Blakqori G. Överby A.K. Heidemann M. Eick D. Weber F. Interferon antagonist NSs of La Crosse virus triggers a DNA damage response-like degradation of transcribing RNA polymerase II.J. Biol.

Interestingly, La Crosse virus is a bunyavirus similar to RVFV, and although its NSs protein is not filamentous in nature, it appears to be involved in the observed response. Elucidating the mechanism by which the DDR is activated for RVFV will allow us to gain greater insight into how DDR pathways are modulated following RNA viral infections. Our previous studies indicated that p53 was phosphorylated at Ser-15 and Ser-46 following infection with RVFV ZH501 (22.Popova T.G. Turell M.J. Espina V. Kehn-Hall K. Kidd J. Narayanan A. Liotta L. Petricoin 3rd, E.F. Kashanchi F. Bailey C. Popov S.G. Reverse-phase phosphoproteome analysis of signaling pathways induced by Rift Valley fever virus in human small airway epithelial cells.PLoS One. 2010; 5: e13805Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). p53 phosphorylation is important for many cellular processes, including apoptosis and DNA damage signaling. In addition, our recently published data indicate that RVFV infection induces oxidative stress (23.Narayanan A. Popova T. Turell M. Kidd J. Chertow J. Popov S.G. Bailey C. Kashanchi F. Kehn-Hall K. Alteration in superoxide dismutase 1 causes oxidative stress and p38 MAPK activation following RVFV infection.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e20354Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), which can also influence this signaling pathway (24.Barzilai A. Yamamoto K. DNA damage responses to oxidative stress.DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 1109-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Based on these data, we hypothesized that DNA damage signaling was being induced upon RVFV infection. Here we show that multiple DNA damage signaling checkpoint proteins are phosphorylated following RVFV infection, including ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), Chk.2, H2A.X, and p53 (Ser-15). In addition, S phase arrest was observed following RVFV infection. Both the DNA damage signaling and the concurrent S phase arrest were dependent on the expression of RVFV NSs. Use of specific checkpoint inhibitors (ATM and Chk.2 inhibitors) resulted in a marked decrease in S phase arrest as well viral production. These findings indicate that RVFV NSs induces the ATM signaling arm of the DDR and that this pathway is beneficial for viral replication. Human small airway lung epithelial cells (HSAECs) (Cambrex Inc., Walkersville, MD) from an anonymous donor were grown in Ham's F-12 medium according to the vendor's protocol. Ham's F-12 was supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% Glutamax, 1% nonessential amino acids, 1% sodium pyruvate, 0.001% β-mercaptoethanol (1000×), and 10% FBS. Vero cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. For experiments using RVFV MP12 strain, 106 HSAECs were cultured in 6-well plates. Cells were infected with MP12 or the MP12 NSs mutants (ΔNSs) at an m.o.i. of 3.0. For infection, the growth medium was removed, and cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS without calcium and magnesium), overlaid with a 400-μl suspension of virus in medium, and incubated for an hour at 37 °C at 5% CO2. Following 1-h incubation at 37 °C, infectious supernatant was removed, cells were washed with PBS, 2 ml of supplemented Ham's F-12 culture medium were added to each well, and the cells were maintained at 37 °C. Experiments involving Clone 13 and recombinant ZH548 (rZH548) virus were performed in Vero or A549 cells. Cells were grown in 6-well plates and seeded at 2.5 × 105. Lysis buffer used for Western blot collection and analysis consisted of a 1:1 mixture of T-PER reagent (Pierce) and 2× Tris-glycine SDS sample buffer (Novex, Invitrogen), 33 mm DTT, and protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (1× Halt mixture, Pierce). Cells were collected directly in lysis buffer and boiled for 10 min. HSAECs were seeded at 5 × 104 in a 96-well plate and pretreated for 2 h with DMSO, ATM, or Chk.2 kinase inhibitors (10 μm) in growth medium. ATM inhibitor 2-morpholin-4-yl-6-thianthren-1-yl-pyran-4-one and Chk.2 inhibitor 2-(4-(4-chlorophenoxy)phenyl)-1H-benzimidazole-5-carboxamide were purchased from EMD4Biosciences. Cultured cells were infected at an m.o.i. of 1 as previously described and then reintroduced to supplemented growth medium with 10 μm concentrations. Supernatants were collected at 24 h postinfection and analyzed by plaque assays. For plaque assays, Vero cells were plated in 6-well plates at 106 to achieve 90–100% confluence (two wells per sample). Samples were diluted in growth medium from 101 to 108, and infections were then carried for each dilution in duplicate as described. After a 1-h infection, an overlay of 3 ml of a 1:1 solution of 0.6% agarose in distilled H2O with 2× Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 2.5% FBS, 1% l-glutamine, 2% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% nonessential amino acids, and 1% sodium pyruvate was added to each well, allowed to solidify, and incubated at 37 °C at 5% CO2 for 72 h. After 72 h, cells were fixed using 10% formaldehyde for 1 h at room temperature, agar plugs were discarded, and fixed cellular monolayers were stained with a 1% crystal violet, 20% methanol solution for 30 min to allow visualization of plaques. Averages were taken from duplicates with dilutions containing fewer than five or more than 100 plaques being discounted. Twenty-five to 30 μl of cell lysates were separated on 10-well 4–12% Bis-Tris gels and transferred either to nitrocellulose membranes using an iBlot gel transfer apparatus (Invitrogen) or to PVDF by overnight wet transfer. The membranes were blocked with a boiled 3% dry milk solution in PBS-Tween 20 for an hour at room temperature. Membranes were probed with antibodies from a DNA Damage Antibody Sampler kit (catalog number 9947, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-RVFV nucleoprotein (N), anti-RVFV Gn, or HRP-conjugated actin (catalog number ab49900-100, Abcam) diluted in 3% milk solution at 1:1000 and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The blots were then washed three times with PBS-Tween 20 and incubated with secondary HRP-coupled goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies diluted 1:10,000 in 3% milk. The blots were visualized by chemiluminescence using a SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate kit (ThermoScientific) and the Molecular Imager ChemiDoc XRS system (Bio-Rad). HeLa cells were grown and treated on coverslips in a 6-well plate, fixed with 4% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS (without calcium and magnesium), blocked in 3% BSA, and incubated with primary antibody in blocking buffer for 1 h at 37 °C using antibodies as described above. After incubation, cells were washed three times in PBS plus 300 mm NaCl and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 3 min. Secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-rabbit 1:200 (Invitrogen) was incubated using as described above, then washed, and stained with DAPI to visualize nuclei. Comet assays were performed using a comet assay kit according to the manufacturer's directions (catalog number 4250-050-K, Trevigen). Fluorescence microscopy was carried out using a Nikon Eclipse 90i microscope. Cells were infected, prepared, and treated in 6- or 12-well plates. For collection, the cells were washed in 1× PBS (without calcium and magnesium) and trypsinized. The trypsin was neutralized by adding back cold medium, cells were collected, spun down, washed twice in 1× PBS (without calcium and magnesium), and resuspended in 70% ice-cold ethanol. The cells were then rehydrated using 1× PBS (without calcium and magnesium) for at least 15 min and spun down as described. The cells were stained with 1 ml of propidium iodide staining solution, and cell cycle analysis was performed on an Accuri C6 flow cytometer using CFlow Plus from Accuri Cytometers Inc. Data analysis was performed with Multicycle AV and FCS Express. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) staining was performed using a BD Pharmingen FITC BrdU Flow kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. In cell cycle experiments, A549 cells were serum-starved for 48 h, treated, and infected as described, released into full growth medium postinfection, and collected 24 h postinfection. Cells were stained as described. Experiments using A549 cells were analyzed using a Guava EasyCyte MINI flow cytometer. All quantifications are based on data obtained from triplicate samples unless indicated otherwise. Error bars in all figures indicate standard deviations (S.D.). p values were calculated using unpaired Student's t test. Many protein-protein interactions are regulated through phosphorylation events as phosphorylation plays a significant role in a wide range of cellular processes, including the antiviral response. Recently we conducted a high throughput proteomics study following RVFV infection using reverse phase protein microarrays (22.Popova T.G. Turell M.J. Espina V. Kehn-Hall K. Kidd J. Narayanan A. Liotta L. Petricoin 3rd, E.F. Kashanchi F. Bailey C. Popov S.G. Reverse-phase phosphoproteome analysis of signaling pathways induced by Rift Valley fever virus in human small airway epithelial cells.PLoS One. 2010; 5: e13805Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that p53 phosphorylation (both Ser-15 and Ser-46) is highly up-regulated following infection. p53-dependent transcriptional events are wide ranging and numerous in their role as cell regulators and have been implicated in numerous DNA damage signaling pathways (25.Yoshida K. Miki Y. The cell death machinery governed by the p53 tumor suppressor in response to DNA damage.Cancer Sci. 2010; 101: 831-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In addition, our recently published data indicate that RVFV infection induces oxidative stress (23.Narayanan A. Popova T. Turell M. Kidd J. Chertow J. Popov S.G. Bailey C. Kashanchi F. Kehn-Hall K. Alteration in superoxide dismutase 1 causes oxidative stress and p38 MAPK activation following RVFV infection.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e20354Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species are well known cellular messengers that play a key role in antimicrobial and antitumor defense and have also been shown to influence the DNA damage signaling pathways (24.Barzilai A. Yamamoto K. DNA damage responses to oxidative stress.DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 1109-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Based on these data along with the well established role NSs plays in nuclear filament formation, we hypothesized that DNA damage signaling was being induced upon RVFV infection. To further explore this hypothesis, we initially analyzed a number of classical DNA damage signaling components following RVFV infection through immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1, A and B). Beginning at 16 h postinfection, we observed phosphorylation of ATM, p53, Chk.2, and H2A.X. However, the phosphorylation was much more pronounced at 24 h postinfection. In contrast, ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related kinase (ATR) was not phosphorylated following RVFV infection; but rather its phosphorylation decreased in an antiparallel sense. These data suggest that the ATM pathway is activated as p53 (Ser-15), Chk.2 (Thr-68), and H2A.X (Ser-139) are all substrates of the ATM arm in the classical DNA damage signaling pathway. We further confirmed the phosphorylation of H2A.X following RVFV infection through confocal fluorescence microscopy. After phosphorylation, H2A.X is known to form distinct nuclear puncta (DNA damage foci), which we detected at 24 h postinfection (Fig. 1C). Collectively, these results indicate that DNA damage signaling, specifically the ATM pathway, is induced following RVFV infection. As activation of the DNA damage response was observed, we sought to determine whether DNA damage was occurring following RVFV infection. It is plausible that host DNA is not directly damaged but rather that the cell is under exogenous stress, which leads to the activation of the DDR pathway. Comet assays were performed to determine whether DNA damage occurred following RVFV infection. The comet assay is a sensitive technique that allows the detection of DNA damage induced by double strand breaks, single strand breaks, alkali-labile sites, oxidative base damage, and DNA cross-linking with DNA or protein. The “head” of the comet is intact DNA, whereas the “tail” is the damaged DNA. Cells were classified as being Type I (minimal/no damage, intact nucleoid) Type II (mild damage, diffuse borders, no tail distinction), or Type III (moderate damage, distinct tail and head) (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, RVFV-infected cells did not display an increase in DNA damage and actually appear to have less Type II damage than mock-infected cells (Fig. 2B). One potential explanation is that the DDR pathway is being specifically targeted and hijacked irrespective of actual DNA damage with activation actually helping to repair any minor DNA damage that is naturally occurring, whereas the mock-infected cells lacking viral DDR activation show typical and minor endogenous and exogenous damage. These results demonstrate that no gross alterations in chromosomal DNA damage were observed in RVFV-infected cells; however, it may be possible that small nicks/breaks on transcriptionally active sites are pr"

We tested the hypothesis that the measurement of the CA 19-9 antigen on individual proteins could improve performance over the standard CA 19-9 assay. We used antibody arrays to measure the levels of the CA 19-9 antigen on multiple proteins in serum or plasma samples from patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma or pancreatitis. Sample sets from three different institutions were examined, comprising 531 individual samples. The measurement of the CA 19-9 antigen on any individual protein did not improve upon the performance of the standard CA 19-9 assay (82% sensitivity at 75% specificity for early-stage cancer), owing to diversity among patients in their CA 19-9 protein carriers. However, a subset of cancer patients with no elevation in the standard CA 19-9 assay showed elevations of the CA 19-9 antigen specifically on the proteins MUC5AC or MUC16 in all sample sets. By combining measurements of the standard CA 19-9 assay with detection of CA 19-9 on MUC5AC and MUC16, the sensitivity of cancer detection was improved relative to CA 19-9 alone in each sample set, achieving 67–80% sensitivity at 98% specificity. This finding demonstrates the value of measuring glycans on specific proteins for improving biomarker performance. Diagnostic tests with improved sensitivity for detecting pancreatic cancer could have important applications for improving the treatment and management of patients suffering from this disease."
https://openalex.org/W1981885395,"Given a compound, how can we effectively predict its biological function? It is a fundamentally important problem because the information thus obtained may benefit the understanding of many basic biological processes and provide useful clues for drug design. In this study, based on the information of chemical-chemical interactions, a novel method was developed that can be used to identify which of the following eleven metabolic pathway classes a query compound may be involved with: (1) Carbohydrate Metabolism, (2) Energy Metabolism, (3) Lipid Metabolism, (4) Nucleotide Metabolism, (5) Amino Acid Metabolism, (6) Metabolism of Other Amino Acids, (7) Glycan Biosynthesis and Metabolism, (8) Metabolism of Cofactors and Vitamins, (9) Metabolism of Terpenoids and Polyketides, (10) Biosynthesis of Other Secondary Metabolites, (11) Xenobiotics Biodegradation and Metabolism. It was observed that the overall success rate obtained by the method via the 5-fold cross-validation test on a benchmark dataset consisting of 3,137 compounds was 77.97%, which is much higher than 10.45%, the corresponding success rate obtained by the random guesses. Besides, to deal with the situation that some compounds may be involved with more than one metabolic pathway class, the method presented here is featured by the capacity able to provide a series of potential metabolic pathway classes ranked according to the descending order of their likelihood for each of the query compounds concerned. Furthermore, our method was also applied to predict 5,549 compounds whose metabolic pathway classes are unknown. Interestingly, the results thus obtained are quite consistent with the deductions from the reports by other investigators. It is anticipated that, with the continuous increase of the chemical-chemical interaction data, the current method will be further enhanced in its power and accuracy, so as to become a useful complementary vehicle in annotating uncharacterized compounds for their biological functions."
https://openalex.org/W2065290731,"Morbidity, mortality and social cost of sepsis are high. Previous studies have suggested that individual cytokines levels could be used as sepsis markers. Therefore, we assessed whether the multiplex technology could identify useful cytokine profiles in Emergency Department (ED) patients.ED patients were included in a single tertiary-care center prospective study. Eligible patients were >18 years and met at least one of the following criteria: fever, suspected systemic infection, ≥ 2 systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, hypotension or shock. Multiplex cytokine measurements were performed on serum samples collected at inclusion. Associations between cytokine levels and sepsis were assessed using univariate and multivariate logistic regressions, principal component analysis (PCA) and agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC).Among the 126 patients (71 men, 55 women; median age: 54 years [19-96 years]) included, 102 had SIRS (81%), 55 (44%) had severe sepsis and 10 (8%) had septic shock. Univariate analysis revealed weak associations between cytokine levels and sepsis. Multivariate analysis revealed independent association between sIL-2R (p = 0.01) and severe sepsis, as well as between sIL-2R (p = 0.04), IL-1β (p = 0.046), IL-8 (p = 0.02) and septic shock. However, neither PCA nor AHC distinguished profiles characteristic of sepsis.Previous non-multiparametric studies might have reached inappropriate conclusions. Indeed, well-defined clinical conditions do not translate into particular cytokine profiles. Additional and larger trials are now required to validate the limited interest of expensive multiplex cytokine profiling for staging septic patients."
https://openalex.org/W1681050646,"The β-secretase enzyme BACE1 initiates production of the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide that comprises plaques in Alzheimer disease (AD) brain. BACE1 levels are increased in AD, potentially accelerating Aβ generation, but the mechanisms of BACE1 elevation are not fully understood. Cdk5/p25 has been implicated in neurodegeneration and BACE1 regulation, suggesting therapeutic Cdk5 inhibition for AD. In addition, caspase 3 has been implicated in BACE1 elevation. Here, we show that the Cdk5 level and p25:p35 ratio were elevated and correlated with BACE1 level in brains of AD patients and 5XFAD transgenic mice. Mouse primary cortical neurons treated with Aβ42 oligomers had increased BACE1 level and p25:p35 ratio. Surprisingly, the Aβ42-induced BACE1 elevation was not blocked by Cdk5 inhibitors CP68130 and roscovitine, and instead the BACE1 level was increased greater than with Aβ42 treatment alone. Moreover, Cdk5 inhibitors alone elevated BACE1 in a time- and dose-dependent manner that coincided with increased caspase 3 cleavage and decreased Cdk5 level. Caspase 3 inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD failed to prevent the Aβ42-induced BACE1 increase. Further experiments suggested that the Aβ42-induced BACE1 elevation was the result of a post-transcriptional mechanism. We conclude that Aβ42 may increase the BACE1 level independently of either Cdk5 or caspase 3 and that Cdk5 inhibition for AD may cause BACE1 elevation, a potentially negative therapeutic outcome."
https://openalex.org/W1985175184,"Chemokines and their receptors are involved in the development and cancer progression. The chemokine CXCL12 interacts with its receptor, CXCR4, to promote cellular adhesion, survival, proliferation and migration. The CXCR4 gene is upregulated in several types of cancers, including skin, lung, pancreas, brain and breast tumors. In pancreatic cancer and melanoma, CXCR4 expression is regulated by DNA methylation within its promoter region. In this study we examined the role of cytosine methylation in the regulation of CXCR4 expression in breast cancer cell lines and also correlated the methylation pattern with the clinicopathological aspects of sixty-nine primary breast tumors from a cohort of Brazilian women. RT-PCR showed that the PMC-42, MCF7 and MDA-MB-436 breast tumor cell lines expressed high levels of CXCR4. Conversely, the MDA-MB-435 cell line only expressed CXCR4 after treatment with 5-Aza-CdR, which suggests that CXCR4 expression is regulated by DNA methylation. To confirm this hypothesis, a 184 bp fragment of the CXCR4 gene promoter region was cloned after sodium bisulfite DNA treatment. Sequencing data showed that cell lines that expressed CXCR4 had only 15% of methylated CpG dinucleotides, while the cell line that not have CXCR4 expression, had a high density of methylation (91%). Loss of DNA methylation in the CXCR4 promoter was detected in 67% of the breast cancer analyzed. The absence of CXCR4 methylation was associated with the tumor stage, size, histological grade, lymph node status, ESR1 methylation and CXCL12 methylation, metastasis and patient death. Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrated that patients with an unmethylated CXCR4 promoter had a poorer overall survival and disease-free survival. Furthermore, patients with both CXCL12 methylation and unmethylated CXCR4 had a shorter overall survival and disease-free survival. These findings suggest that the DNA methylation status of both CXCR4 and CXCL12 genes could be used as a biomarker for prognosis in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1976575373,"Levetiracetam is an FDA-approved drug used to treat epilepsy and other disorders of the nervous system. Although it is known that levetiracetam binds the synaptic vesicle protein SV2A, how drug binding affects synaptic functioning remains unknown. Here we report that levetiracetam reverses the effects of excess SV2A in autaptic hippocampal neurons. Expression of an SV2A-EGFP fusion protein produced a ∼1.5-fold increase in synaptic levels of SV2, and resulted in reduced synaptic release probability. The overexpression phenotype parallels that seen in neurons from SV2 knockout mice, which experience severe seizures. Overexpression of SV2A also increased synaptic levels of the calcium-sensor protein synaptotagmin, an SV2-binding protein whose stability and trafficking are regulated by SV2. Treatment with levetiracetam rescued normal neurotransmission and restored normal levels of SV2 and synaptotagmin at the synapse. These results indicate that changes in SV2 expression in either direction impact neurotransmission, and suggest that levetiracetam may modulate SV2 protein interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2030890325,"Bovine tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium bovis is a serious and economically important disease of cattle. Badgers have been implicated in the transmission and maintenance of the disease in the UK since the 1970s. Recent studies have provided substantial evidence of widespread and frequent visits by badgers to farm buildings during which there is the potential for close direct contact with cattle and contamination of cattle feed.Here we evaluated the effectiveness of simple exclusion measures in improving farm biosecurity and preventing badger visits to farm buildings. In the first phase of the study, 32 farms were surveyed using motion-triggered infrared cameras on potential entrances to farm buildings to determine the background level of badger visits experienced by each farm. In the second phase, they were divided into four treatment groups; ""Control"", ""Feed Storage"", ""Cattle Housing"" and ""Both"", whereby no exclusion measures were installed, exclusion measures were installed on feed storage areas only, cattle housing only or both feed storage and cattle housing, respectively. Badger exclusion measures included sheet metal gates, adjustable metal panels for gates, sheet metal fencing, feed bins and electric fencing. Cameras were deployed for at least 365 nights in each phase on each farm.Badger visits to farm buildings occurred on 19 of the 32 farms in phase one. In phase two, the simple exclusion measures were 100% effective in preventing badger entry into farm buildings, as long as they were appropriately deployed. Furthermore, the installation of exclusion measures also reduced the level of badger visits to the rest of the farmyard. The findings of the present study clearly demonstrate how relatively simple practical measures can substantially reduce the likelihood of badger visits to buildings and reduce some of the potential for contact and disease transmission between badgers and cattle."
https://openalex.org/W2045419504,"Widespread resistance among circulating influenza A strains to at least one of the anti-influenza drugs is a major public health concern. A triple combination antiviral drug (TCAD) regimen comprised of amantadine, oseltamivir, and ribavirin has been shown to have synergistic and broad spectrum activity against influenza A strains, including drug resistant strains. Here, we used mathematical modeling along with three different experimental approaches to understand the effects of single agents, double combinations, and the TCAD regimen on resistance in influenza in vitro, including: 1) serial passage at constant drug concentrations, 2) serial passage at escalating drug concentrations, and 3) evaluation of the contribution of each component of the TCAD regimen to the suppression of resistance. Consistent with the modeling which demonstrated that three drugs were required to suppress the emergence of resistance in influenza A, treatment with the TCAD regimen resulted in the sustained suppression of drug resistant viruses, whereas treatment with amantadine alone or the amantadine-oseltamivir double combination led to the rapid selection of resistant variants which comprised ∼100% of the population. Furthermore, the TCAD regimen imposed a high genetic barrier to resistance, requiring multiple mutations in order to escape the effects of all the drugs in the regimen. Finally, we demonstrate that each drug in the TCAD regimen made a significant contribution to the suppression of virus breakthrough and resistance at clinically achievable concentrations. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the TCAD regimen was superior to double combinations and single agents at suppressing resistance, and that three drugs at a minimum were required to impede the selection of drug resistant variants in influenza A virus. The use of mathematical modeling with multiple experimental designs and molecular readouts to evaluate and optimize combination drug regimens for the suppression of resistance may be broadly applicable to other infectious diseases."

We performed multivariable linear regression to evaluate the association between right heart echocardiographic parameters and six minute walk distance adjusting for lung function, age, sex, race, and BMI.The mean six minute walk distance was 324±106 meters. All subjects had preserved left ventricular (LV) systolic function (LV ejection fraction 62.3%±6.1%). 54.1% had evidence of some degree of diastolic dysfunction. 17.6% of subjects had evidence of right ventricular enlargement and 36.5% had right atrial enlargement. In univariate analysis RV wall thickness (β = -68.6; p = 0.002), log right atrial area (β = -297.9; p = 0.004), LV mass index (β = -1.3; p = 0.03), E/E' ratio (β = -5.5; p = 0.02), and degree of diastolic dysfunction (β = -42.8; p = 0.006) were associated with six minute walk distance. After adjustment for co-variables, the associations between right atrial area (log right atrial area β = -349.8; p = 0.003) and right ventricular wall thickness (β = -43.8; p = 0.04) with lower six minute walk distance remained significant independent of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1). LV mass index, E/E' ratio, and degree of diastolic dysfunction were not independent predictors of six minute walk distance.In patients with non-severe COPD right sided cardiac structural changes are associated with lower six minute walk distance independent of lung function. These findings may indicate that echocardiographic evidence of pulmonary hypertension is present in patients with non-severe COPD and has important functional consequences."
https://openalex.org/W1997810327,"Using yeast-two hybrid screening followed by co-immunoprecipitation assay, we have found that the Lafora disease ubiquitin ligase malin interacts with dishevelled2, a key mediator of Wnt signaling pathway. Overexpression of malin enhances the degradation of dishevelled2 and inhibits Wnt signaling, which is evident from the down-regulation of β-catenin target genes and the decrease in β-catenin-mediated transcriptional activity. Partial knockdown of malin significantly increases the level of dishevelled2 and up-regulates Wnt signaling. Several malin mutants are found to be ineffective in degrading dishevelled2 and regulating the Wnt pathway. We have also found that malin enhances K48- and K63-linked ubiquitination of dishevelled2 that could lead to its degradation through both proteasome and autophagy. Altogether, our results indicate that malin regulates Wnt signaling pathway through the degradation of dishevelled2 and suggest possible deregulation of Wnt signaling in Lafora disease.

https://openalex.org/W2111726823,"Background Altered dosage of the transcription factor PAX6 causes multiple human eye pathophysiologies. PAX6+/− heterozygotes suffer from aniridia and aniridia-related keratopathy (ARK), a corneal deterioration that probably involves a limbal epithelial stem cell (LESC) deficiency. Heterozygous Pax6+/Sey-Neu (Pax6+/−) mice recapitulate the human disease and are a good model of ARK. Corneal pathologies also occur in other mouse Pax6 mutants and in PAX77Tg/− transgenics, which over-express Pax6 and model human PAX6 duplication. Methodology/Principal Findings We used electron microscopy to investigate ocular defects in Pax6+/− heterozygotes (low Pax6 levels) and PAX77Tg/− transgenics (high Pax6 levels). As well as the well-documented epithelial defects, aberrant Pax6 dosage had profound effects on the corneal stroma and endothelium in both genotypes, including cellular vacuolation, similar to that reported for human macular corneal dystrophy. We used mosaic expression of an X-linked LacZ transgene in X-inactivation mosaic female (XLacZTg/−) mice to investigate corneal epithelial maintenance by LESC clones in Pax6+/− and PAX77Tg/− mosaic mice. PAX77Tg/− mosaics, over-expressing Pax6, produced normal corneal epithelial radial striped patterns (despite other corneal defects), suggesting that centripetal cell movement was unaffected. Moderately disrupted patterns in Pax6+/− mosaics were corrected by introducing the PAX77 transgene (in Pax6+/−, PAX77Tg/− mosaics). Pax6Leca4/+, XLacZTg/− mosaic mice (heterozygous for the Pax6Leca4 missense mutation) showed more severely disrupted mosaic patterns. Corrected corneal epithelial stripe numbers (an indirect estimate of active LESC clone numbers) declined with age (between 15 and 30 weeks) in wild-type XLacZTg/− mosaics. In contrast, corrected stripe numbers were already low at 15 weeks in Pax6+/− and PAX77Tg/− mosaic corneas, suggesting Pax6 under- and over-expression both affect LESC clones. Conclusions/Significance Pax6+/− and PAX77Tg/− genotypes have only relatively minor effects on LESC clone numbers but cause more severe corneal endothelial and stromal defects. This should prompt further investigations of the pathophysiology underlying human aniridia and ARK."
https://openalex.org/W2090323287,"G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) are important regulators of G protein-coupled receptor function and mediate receptor desensitization, internalization, and signaling. While GRKs also interact with and/or phosphorylate many other proteins and modify their function, relatively little is known about the cellular localization of endogenous GRKs. Here we report that GRK5 co-localizes with γ-tubulin, centrin, and pericentrin in centrosomes. The centrosomal localization of GRK5 is observed predominantly at interphase and although its localization is not dependent on microtubules, it can mediate microtubule nucleation of centrosomes. Knockdown of GRK5 expression leads to G2/M arrest, characterized by a prolonged G2 phase, which can be rescued by expression of wild type but not catalytically inactive GRK5. This G2/M arrest appears to be due to increased expression of p53, reduced activity of aurora A kinase and a subsequent delay in the activation of polo-like kinase 1. Overall, these studies demonstrate that GRK5 is localized in the centrosome and regulates microtubule nucleation and normal cell cycle progression."
https://openalex.org/W2012433802,"Eph kinases constitute the largest receptor tyrosine kinase family, and their ligands, ephrins (Efns), are also cell surface molecules. Our study is the first to assess the role of Ephb6 in blood pressure (BP) regulation. We observed that EphB6 and all three of its Efnb ligands were expressed on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) in mice. We discovered that small arteries from castrated Ephb6 gene KO males showed increased contractility, RhoA activation, and constitutive myosin light chain phosphorylation ex vivo compared with their WT counterparts. Consistent with this finding, castrated Ephb6 KO mice presented heightened BP compared with castrated WT controls. In vitro experiments in VSMC revealed that cross-linking Efnbs but not Ephb6 resulted in reduced VSMC contractions, suggesting that reverse signaling through Efnbs was responsible for the observed BP phenotype. The reverse signaling was mediated by an adaptor protein Grip1. Additional experiments demonstrated decreased 24-h urine catecholamines in male Ephb6 KO mice, probably as a compensatory feedback mechanism to keep their BP in the normal range. After castration, however, such compensation was abolished in Ephb6 KO mice and was likely the reason why BP increased overtly in these animals. It suggests that Ephb6 has a target in the nervous/endocrine system in addition to VSMC, regulating a testosterone-dependent catecholamine compensatory mechanism. Our study discloses that Ephs and Efns, in concert with testosterone, play a critical role in regulating small artery contractility and BP."
https://openalex.org/W2025486248,"Investigation of the genetic diversity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in China has shown that Beijing genotype strains play a dominant role in the tuberculosis (TB) epidemic. In order to examine the strain diversity in the whole country, and to study the evolutionary development of Beijing strains, we sought to genotype a large collection of isolates using different methods.We applied a 15-loci VNTR typing analysis on 1,586 isolates from the Beijing municipality and 12 Chinese provinces or autonomous regions. The data was compared to that of 900 isolates from various other worldwide geographic regions outside of China. A total of 1,162/1,586 (73.2%) of the isolates, distributed into 472 VNTR types, were found to belong to the Beijing genotype family and this represented 56 to 94% of the isolates in each of the localizations. VNTR typing revealed that the majority of the non-Beijing isolates fall into two genotype families, which represented 17% of the total number of isolates, and seem largely restricted to China. A small number of East African Indian genotype strains was also observed in this collection. Ancient Beijing strains with an intact region of difference (RD) 181, as well as strains presumably resembling ancestors of the whole Beijing genotype family, were mainly found in the Guangxi autonomous region.This is the largest M. tuberculosis VNTR-based genotyping study performed in China to date. The high percentage of Beijing isolates in the whole country and the presence in the South of strains representing early branching points may be an indication that the Beijing lineage originated from China, probably in the Guangxi region. Two modern lineages are shown here to represent the majority of non-Beijing Chinese isolates. The observed geographic distribution of the different lineages within China suggests that natural frontiers are major factors in their diffusion."
https://openalex.org/W1969591490,"In Naja kaouthia cobra venom, we have earlier discovered a covalent dimeric form of α-cobratoxin (αCT-αCT) with two intermolecular disulfides, but we could not determine their positions. Here, we report the αCT-αCT crystal structure at 1.94 Å where intermolecular disulfides are identified between Cys(3) in one protomer and Cys(20) of the second, and vice versa. All remaining intramolecular disulfides, including the additional bridge between Cys(26) and Cys(30) in the central loops II, have the same positions as in monomeric α-cobratoxin. The three-finger fold is essentially preserved in each protomer, but the arrangement of the αCT-αCT dimer differs from those of noncovalent crystallographic dimers of three-finger toxins (TFT) or from the κ-bungarotoxin solution structure. Selective reduction of Cys(26)-Cys(30) in one protomer does not affect the activity against the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), whereas its reduction in both protomers almost prevents α7 nAChR recognition. On the contrary, reduction of one or both Cys(26)-Cys(30) disulfides in αCT-αCT considerably potentiates inhibition of the α3β2 nAChR by the toxin. The heteromeric dimer of α-cobratoxin and cytotoxin has an activity similar to that of αCT-αCT against the α7 nAChR and is more active against α3β2 nAChRs. Our results demonstrate that at least one Cys(26)-Cys(30) disulfide in covalent TFT dimers, similar to the monomeric TFTs, is essential for their recognition by α7 nAChR, although it is less important for interaction of covalent TFT dimers with the α3β2 nAChR."

The SMMA structure provides a molecular basis for the functional properties that are unique to hyperthermophile maltogenic amylases from archaea and that distinguish SMMA from moderate thermophilic or mesophilic bacterial enzymes. Many organisms live in physically or geochemically extreme conditions that are detrimental to most organisms. Most eukaryotic organisms cannot tolerate temperatures higher than 50 °C, due to the sensitivity of certain cellular components. The discovery of hyperthermophilic microorganisms living near, at, and above 100 °C has revolutionized scientific thought in this area, and many scientists have become interested in such systems because they have developed specific physicochemical characteristics. Due to these particular properties, enzymes from extremophiles offer great potential for basic research and for biotechnological applications. For example, most industrial starch processes require high temperatures for liquefaction and saccharification. Therefore, there is enthusiastic interest in finding new sources of thermostable amylolytic enzymes. Recently, we reported a novel maltogenic amylase from Staphylothermus marinus (1.Li D. Park J.T.

The cells were collected by centrifugation (8000 × g, 30 min), resuspended in 300 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole), and sonicated. The supernatant was collected by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) and heated at 70 °C for 20 min to remove the thermolabile E. coli proteins. The crude enzyme was further purified using a nickel-NTA Superflow® column, as described previously (14.Kim T.J. Kim M.J. Kim B.C. Kim J.C. Cheong T.K. Kim J.W. Park K.H.

For thin layer chromatography (TLC) analysis, the reaction products were spotted onto Whatman K5F silica gel plates (Whatman plc, Maidstone, UK) and developed using isopropyl alcohol/ethyl acetate/water (3:1:1, v/v/v) as the solvent system. Proximity to the end of a secondary structure element is defined as being within 4 amino acids for helix and within 1 amino acid for strand, where the termini are assigned from the Protein Data Bank (33.Greaves R.B. Warwicker J. Stability and solubility of proteins from extremophiles.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 380: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Structures used in the analysis are Protein Data Bank entries 1GVI (ThMA), 1J0H (NPase), 1JI2 (TVAII), and 1EA9 (CDase). Residues in the exposed surfaces were identified using the Areaimol program (34.Lee B. Richards F.M. The interpretation of protein structures. Estimation of static accessibility.J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (5341) Google Scholar). The crystal structure revealed that SMMA comprises four domains: the N, catalytic, and C domains, which are observed in most CD-hydrolyzing enzymes, and an additional novel N-terminal domain, the N′ domain, which was first observed in this study (Fig. 1a). Initially, the structure was determined and refined to a 2.28 Å resolution using molecular replacement, with the catalytic and C domains of neopullulanase from B. stearothermophilus (Protein Data Bank entry 1J0H) as the template structure. An attempt at molecular replacement with the entire three-domain region failed, which may have been due to the significantly altered orientation and geometry of the SMMA N domain (r.m.s. deviation of 2.3 Å for 463 Cα atoms). During manual model building for the N-terminal region, the electron density of the region showed two vague, separate “blobs,” which allowed the detection of the N (aa 116–219) and N′ (aa 1–115) domains of SMMA. The SMMA catalytic domain displays a conserved (β/α) 8-barrel fold with a distinct loop (aa 342–397) protruding from the barrel. Most CD-hydrolyzing enzymes have a protruding loop located near the active site, which is called the B domain and forms a portion of the substrate binding groove for subsites −2, −3, or −4. However, SMMA has a much longer insertion of aa 342–397 in this region, creating a larger domain at the entrance of the groove (Fig. 1b). In this groove, Tyr-389, which is in the middle of a helix in aa 385–391, forms an entrance gate with Tyr-257. Because SMMA and other CD-hydrolyzing enzymes from archaea have this insertion, the protruding region might serve as a signature that is unique to maltogenic amylases from archaea. Another sequence-structural feature is the presence of a glycine in the i + 4 position after the catalytic nucleophile Asp-442 (Fig. 2) because typical maltogenic amylases (i.e. members of the neopullulanase subfamily) have a glutamate in that position as a part of the four-residue signature VANE (10.Oslancová A. Janecek S. Oligo-1,6-glucosidase and neopullulanase enzyme subfamilies from the alpha-amylase family defined by the fifth conserved sequence region.Cell Mol.

Searching protein structure databases with DaliLite version 3.Bioinformatics. 2008; 24: 2780-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar) using the SMMA structure identified the neopullulanase from B. stearothermophilus (29% identity) as its closest structural homologue, with a 2.6 Å r.m.s. deviation (536 Cα atoms). The α amylase II (TVAII) from T. vulgaris R-47 (30% identity) was identified as the second closest homologue with a 2.6 Å r.m.s. deviation (537 Cα atoms). The loop regions comprising aa 236–264 and 653–689 had high B-factors (61.3 average) at the surface, and the electron density map for the loop of aa 671–677 in the C domain was too weak to build a model, which suggests that it may be flexible. SMMA forms a homodimer via an interaction between the adjacent, novel N′ domains, which have a 2-fold axis perpendicular to the arc shape of the β-strands' interface (Fig. 1c). Each monomer is primarily associated through hydrophobic interactions at the center of the region of aa 5–19 (Ile-5 and -19 from one molecule against Ile-9 from the other). This interaction is supplemented by salt bridges (Arg-181/Asp-422 and Arg-50/Glu-198) at both ends of the strands, which yield a 2140.7 Å2 interface (Fig. 1d). Most CD-hydrolyzing enzymes form dimers with the N domain intertwined. However, the SMMA dimer configuration is different from previously reported CD-hydrolyzing enzymes, in that the dimer is arranged with adjacent monomers and an interface unrelated to the active sites. The long N-terminal region of SMMA includes two repeated motifs, the N and N′ domains, with a β-sandwich fold (6.2 Å r.m.s. deviation for 12 Cα atoms) (Fig. 3a). A structural homology search for the truncated N′ domain generated the β-subunit of the 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) with a 1.9 Å r.m.s. deviation over 80 residues (Z score, 10.2) using the Dali and 1.71 Å over 80 residues (Z score, 6.2) using the SSM server (36.Krissinel E.

Despite the low overall sequence similarity, all of the structures superimposed well onto the SMMA N′ domain and share 6–8 β-strands from the β-sandwich fold, except for the long extended loop of aa 88–110 between the 7th and 8th β strands in SMMA (Fig. 3b). Eight of 15 structures have protruding loops that correspond to the loop of aa 88–110 in SMMA, but the SMMA β-strand loop is much longer (8.2 Å) than the other corresponding loo"

Other transmembrane proteins affect AMPA receptor gating, such as the cornichons (4.Schwenk J. Harmel N. Zolles G. Bildl W. Kulik A. Heimrich B. Chisaka O. Jonas P. Schulte U. Fakler B. Klöcker N.

Moreover, proteins such as TARPs and synapse differentiation-induced gene 1 (SynDIG1) (7.Kalashnikova E. Lorca R.A. Kaur I. Barisone G.A. Li B. Ishimaru T. Trimmer J.S. Mohapatra D.P. Díaz E.

Fine-tuning of the receptor-gating kinetics and synaptic expression by auxiliary proteins may underlie the different kinetics of gating observed for native AMPA receptors and may depend on the expression pattern of auxiliary subunits, those which have been described and additional ones, yet to be identified. We searched for novel AMPA receptor binding partners using a pull-down assay in rat cerebellum extracts with the intracellular C terminus of GluA4 as bait. Mass spectrometry analysis of the purified proteins suggested an interaction of GluA4 with the transmembrane protein Contactin associated protein 1 (Caspr1). Biochemical studies confirmed the interaction between Caspr1 and AMPA receptors in the rat brain. Coexpression of Caspr1 with GluA1 increases glutamate-evoked currents. Furthermore, Caspr1 is localized to dendrites and excitatory synapses in hippocampal neurons and regulates the cell surface and synaptic expression of GluA1-containing AMPA receptors.

For plasmid-based RNA inhibition of Caspr1, the complementary oligonucleotides that target nucleotides 2254–2273 (GAACAGCATTTCTACTGGG) of rat Caspr1 (NM_032061) were annealed and ligated into the HpaI/XhoI sites of the U6 promoter-driven short hairpin RNA expression vector pLentiLox3.7(CMV)EGFP that expresses EGFP under the CMV promoter. The construct for expressing Caspr1* resistant against Caspr1-shRNA was generated by making the following two point mutations, indicated by underlines, in the shRNA-targeting site: GAGCAGCATTTCTATTGGG. All the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The rat cerebellum was homogenized in 10 volumes of ice-cold 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 320 mm sucrose. The homogenate was centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was homogenized again in the same Tris buffer and centrifuged at 700 × g, for 10 min at 4 °C.

Rat cerebellum lysates were diluted with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 0.5% deoxycholate (DOC), and 0.1% SDS at a final pH of 7.5), supplemented with 1 mm DTT and a mixture of protease inhibitors, and sonicated. After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was split in two tubes. One was incubated with 50 μg of GST and the other with 50 μg of the fusion protein of interest at 4 °C for 3 h. 50 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay-equilibrated glutathione-Sepharose was added to both samples and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. The samples were washed four times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and the proteins were eluted by boiling at 95 °C in 50 μl of sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and stained with silver nitrate. Protein bands were excised manually from the gel and digested automatically using a Proteineer DP protein digestion station (Bruker-Daltonics, Bremen, Germany), according to a previously described protocol (9.Shevchenko A.

Mass measurements were performed in positive ion reflector mode using 140-ns delayed extraction and a nitrogen laser (337 nm). The laser repetition rate was 50 Hz, and the ion acceleration voltage was 25 kV. Mass measurements were performed automatically through fuzzy logic-based software to accumulate 100 single laser shot spectra or manually to accumulate approximately 200 single laser shot spectra. Each spectrum was internally calibrated with the mass signals of two trypsin autolysis ions: (VATVSLPR+H)+ (m/z = 842.510) and (LGEHNIDVLEGNEQFINAAK+H)+ (m/z = 2211.105) to reach a typical mass measurement accuracy of ± 30 ppm. Known trypsin and keratin mass signals as well as potential sodium adducts (+21.982 Da) or signals arising from methionine oxidation (+15.995 Da) were removed from the peak list. The measured tryptic peptide masses were transferred through the MS BioTools program (Bruker-Daltonics) as inputs to search the NCBInr database using Mascot software (Matrix Science, London, UK). This analysis was performed at the Unidad de Proteómica, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC), Madrid. For coimmunoprecipitation assays, lysates of COS 7 cells expressing the proteins of interest or rat brain synaptosomes (1 mg) were solubilized in immunoprecipitation buffer (IPB) (10 mm Tris (pH 7.0), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 1% Triton X-100, supplemented with protease inhibitors). The samples were sonicated on ice for 30 s, and the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 4 °C. Soluble extracts were incubated with 100 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose beads suspended in IPB at 4 °C for 1 h to preabsorb proteins that stick nonspecifically to the protein A-Sepharose beads. The supernatant was incubated either with the antibody of interest or with the same amount of non-immune IgGs at 4 °C, for 3 h and was then incubated with 100 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose beads (2 h at 4 °C). The beads were washed sequentially in IPB + 1% Triton (2×), in IPB + 1% Triton + 500 mm NaCl (3×), and in IPB (2×). The proteins were eluted by boiling in sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blot analysis. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE in 7.5% polyacrylamide gels. For Western blot analysis, proteins were transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore, Madrid, Spain) by electroblotting. The membranes were blocked, incubated with primary and secondary antibodies, and immunostaining was visualized by the enhanced chemifluorescence method on a Storm 860 Gel and Blot Imaging System (GE Healthcare, Carnaxide, Portugal). Primary cultures of rat hippocampal and cortical neurons were prepared from the hippocampi or cortices of E18-E19 Wistar rat embryos, after treatment with trypsin (0.06%, 15 min, 37 °C, Invitrogen), in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution (5.36 mm KCl, 0.44 mm KH2PO4, 137 mm NaCl, 4.16 mm NaHCO3, 0.34 mm Na2HPO4.2H2O, 5 mm glucose, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10 mm HEPES, 0.001% phenol red). The hippocampal cells were washed with 10% fetal bovine serum prepared in Hanks' balanced salt solution to stop trypsin activity and then washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution to remove serum and avoid glia growth. Cortical cells were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution six times. Cells were transferred to neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with B27 supplement (1:50 dilution, Invitrogen), 25 μm glutamate, 0.5 mm glutamine, and 0.12 mg/ml gentamycin. The cells were mechanically dissociated and then plated in 6-well plates (1 × 105 cells/cm2 for cortical neurons), coated with poly-D-lysine (0.1 mg/ml). For imaging purposes, low-density hippocampal cells were plated at a final density of 3 × 105 cells/dish on poly-D-lysine-coated coverslips in 60 mm culture dishes in neuronal plating medium (minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% horse serum, 0.6% glucose, and 1 mm pyruvic acid). After 2–4 h, coverslips were flipped over an astroglial feeder layer. These neurons grew face-down over the feeder layer but were kept separate from the glia by wax dots on the neuronal side of the coverslips. To prevent the overgrowth of the glia, neuron cultures were treated with 5 μm cytosine arabinoside after 3 days in vitro (DIV). Cultures were maintained in neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 supplement in a humidified incubator of 5% CO2/95% air at 37 °C. Constructs were recombinantly expressed in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons using the calcium phosphate transfection protocol (adapted from Ref. 11.Jiang M. Deng L. Chen G. High Ca(2+)-phosphate transfection efficiency enables single neuron gene analysis.Gene. Ther. 2004; 11: 1303-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, a CaCl2 solution (2.5 m in 10 mm HEPES) was added, dropwise, to plasmid DNA to a final concentration of 250 mm CaCl2. This was then added to an equivalent volume of HEPES-buffered transfection solution (274 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1.4 mm Na2HPO4, 11 mm dextrose, 42 mm HEPES (pH 7.2)). The mixture was vortexed gently for 2–3 s, and the precipitate was allowed to develop at room temperature for 30 min. The precipitated DNA was added dropwise to the coverslips, and the cultures were incubated for 1–3 h in the presence of kynurenic acid (2 mm). Each coverslip was transferred to a fresh well of the 24-well plate containing 1 ml of culture medium with kynurenic acid (2 mm), slightly acidified with HCl (∼5 mm final concentration), and the plate was incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 10–15 min. Coverslips were then transferred to a fresh well of the 24-well plate containing conditioned medium and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 to allow expression of the transfected constructs. For purification of rat brain synaptosomes, two rat brains were removed, placed in 5 volumes of ice-cold solution A (5 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.31 m sucrose (pH 7.4) supplemented with 0.2 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, and a mixture of protease inhibitors) and homogenized with a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer (8 strokes). The homogenates were centrifuged at 1400 × g for 10 min. The supernatant solution was saved, and the pellet was rehomogenized in 5 volumes (considering the initial weight) of solution A and centrifuged at 710 × g for 10 min. Supernatants were pooled and centrifuged at 13,800 × g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 24 ml/10g of buffer B (6 mm Tris (pH 8.1), 0.32 m sucrose, supplemented with protease inhibitors). This fraction (P2) was used directly for immunoprecipitation studies. The procedure for purification of synaptic fractions from cultured cortical neurons was adapted from Ref. 12.Peça J. Feliciano C.

Briefly, 38 × 106 cortical cells were collected and homogenized in HEPES-buffered sucrose solution (0.32 m sucrose, 4 mm HEPES (pH 7.4)) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (0.2 mm PMSF, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml pepstatin. Culture homogenate was collected and centrifuged at 900 × g for 15 min to obtain the non-nuclear fraction (S1). The resultant supernatant was centrifuged at 18.000 × g for 15 min to yield the crude synaptosomal pellet (P2). P2 was resuspended in HEPES-buffered sucrose and centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 15 min to yield the washed crude synaptosomal fraction. This fraction was submitted to hypo-osmotic shock by resuspending the pellet in HEPES buffer (4 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) plus protease and phosphatase inhibitors) and incubated 1–2 h with orbital rotation at 4 °C. The lysate was centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 20 min, and the pellet (lysed synaptosomal membrane fraction) was resuspended in HEPES-buffered sucrose (without sodium orthovanadate), placed on top of a discontinuous sucrose gradient (0.8 m, 1 m, 1.2 m) and spun at 150,000 × g for 2 h in a swinging bucket rotor. Synaptic plasma membranes were recovered between the 1.0 m and 1.2 m layers, diluted to 0.32 m sucrose, and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 30 min. Synaptic plasma membranes were resuspended in HEPES/EDTA buffer (50 mm HEPES, 2 mm EDTA (pH 7.4)) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors and solubilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min with orbital rotation at 4 °C, followed by 20 min of centrifugation at 200,000 × g. The remaining pellet, corresponding to the PSDs, was resuspended in HEPES/EDTA containing 0.5% SDS. All experimental procedures and centrifugations were performed on ice or at 4 °C. For protein quantification, samples were boiled for 5 min at 95 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad method, and samples were denatured with 5× concentrated denaturating buffer (125 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 100 mm glycine, 10% SDS, 200 mm DTT, 40% glycerol, 3 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) and separated by SDS-PAGE. HEK293 cells were transfected using FuGENE6 with GFP and GluA1, with or without Caspr1, at a cDNA ratio of 1:1. Two to three days after transfection, cells were bathed in HEPES-buffered solution containing 145 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES adjusted to 320 mOsm/liter (pH 7.4) with NaOH at room temperature. Whole-cell recordings were performed on green fluorescent cells lifted off the coverslip, placed under the flow of a theta tube, and held at −80 to −40 mV. Recording pipettes (resistance 3–5 MΩ) were filled with a solution containing 130 mm CsCH3SO3, 2 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, 4 mm Na2ATP, adjusted to 310 mOsm/liter (pH 7.2) with CsOH. Currents were evoked by long application of 10 mm glutamate for 100 ms or 1 ms every 20 s by moving the theta tube laterally with a piezoelectric device under computer control. Neurons were fixed for 15 min in 4% sucrose/4%paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature and permeabilized with PBS + 0.25% Triton X-100 for 5 min at 4 °C. The neurons were then incubated in 10% BSA in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C to block nonspecific staining and incubated with the indicated primary antibodies diluted in 3% BSA in PBS (2 h, 37 °C). After washing in PBS, cells were incubated with the secondary antibody diluted in 3% BSA in PBS (45 min, 37 °C). The coverslips were mounted using fluorescent mounting medium from DAKO (Glostrup, Denmark). For labeling surface GluA1-containing receptors, live neurons were incubated for 10 min at room temperature with the GluA1 N-terminal antibody diluted in PBS, after which the cells were briefly rinsed in PBS, fixed, and probed as described above. Imaging was performed on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 m microscope using a 63 × 1.4 numerical aperture oil objective. Images were quantified using image analysis software (ImageJ). For quantitation, sets of cells were cultured and stained simultaneously and imaged using identical settings. The region of interest was randomly selected, and the dendritic length was measured using MAP2 staining. For Caspr1 measurements, the PSD95 and VGLUT signals were thresholded, dilated, and their colocalization was determined. The Caspr1 signal was measured after thresholds were set so that recognizable clusters were included in the analysis, and the Caspr1 signal present in glutamatergic synapses was obtained by measuring the Caspr1 puncta positive for both PSD95 and VGLUT. To calculate the fraction of glutamatergic synapses containing Caspr1, the number of synapses per dendritic length was determined by colocalizing the thresholded PSD95 and VGLUT signals. The number of glutamatergic synapses containing Caspr1 per dendritic length was determined by identifying PSD95- and VGLUT-positive clusters that were also labeled for Caspr1. For quantifying the GluA1 signal, fields for imaging were chosen by the GFP channel for the presence of transfected, GFP-positive neurons. The cell surface GluA1 digital images were subjected to a user-defined intensity threshold to select clusters and measured for cluster intensity, number, and area for the selected region. The synaptic GluA1 clusters were selected by their overlap with thresholded and dilated PSD95 signal. Measurements were performed in a minimum of three independent preparations, and at least nine cells per condition were analyzed for each preparation. To identify proteins that specifically interact with the C terminus of the long splice isoform of GluA4, pull-down experiments were performed using GST fused to the C terminus of rat GluA4 (GST-CTA4) and adult rat cerebellum lysate because GluA4 is particularly abundant in this brain region (14.Ripellino J.A. Neve R.L. Howe J.R. Expression and heteromeric interactions of non-N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor subunits in the developing and adult cerebellum.Neuroscience. 1998; 82: 485-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). MALDI peptide mass fingerprint analysis identified Caspr1 and its binding partner Contactin1 (Fig. 1A and supplemental Figs. 1 and 2) among the proteins that were exclusive to the GST-CTA4 condition. Contactin1 is a glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol-anchored member of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily, which has been implicated previously in synaptic plasticity (15.Murai K.K. Misner D. Ranscht B.

It has an extracellular architecture similar to neurexins and an intracellular region containing a domain that binds to 4.1-band proteins and a proline-rich sequence (16.Peles E. Nativ M. Lustig M.

We used additional biochemical assays to confirm the interaction between Caspr1 and GluA4 and tested whether the interaction is specific to GluA4. Caspr1 coprecipitated with FLAG-tagged GluA4 from cotransfected heterologous cells (Fig. 1B), whereas precipitation of Caspr1 was not observed when using non-immune immunoglobulins. Notably, Caspr1 also coimmunoprecipitated with cotransfected AMPA receptor subunits GluA1, GluA2, or the longer splice isoform of GluA2, GluA2L, but not with GFP-TrkB (Fig. 1B). To determine whether these interactions also occur in the brain, we used synaptosomes isolated from adult rat brain to immunoprecipitate GluA4, GluA1, or the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit GluN1 (Fig. 1C). Caspr1 coimmunoprecipitated with both GluA1 and GluA4 isolated from synaptosomes but not with GluN1, and immunoprecipitation of Caspr1 resulted in coimmunoprecipitation of GluA1 (Fig. 1C). These results confirm that Caspr1 interacts with AMPA receptor subunits in the rat brain and that synaptically localized AMPA receptors interact with Caspr1. Because we identified Caspr1 as a potential GluA4 interactor using the intracellular C terminus of GluA4, we tested whether the interaction between Caspr1 and GluAs occurs between the intracellular regions of these proteins. The intracellular C terminus of Caspr1 fused to GST (GST-CTCaspr1) pulled-down GluA1 and GluA2 from rat cerebellum lysates (Fig. 1D), confirming a role for this region in the interaction with AMPA receptors. Caspr1 plays important roles in the correct assembly of the paranodes (20.Bhat M.A. Rios J.C. Lu Y. Garcia-Fresco G.P. Ching W. St Martin M. Li J. Einheber S. Chesler M. Rosenbluth J. Salzer J.L.

https://openalex.org/W2055301708,"Phosphate toxicity is an important determinant of mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), particularly those undergoing hemodialysis treatments. CKD patients are advised to take a low phosphate-containing diet, and are additionally prescribed with phosphate-lowering drugs. Since these patients usually seek guidance from their physicians and nurses for their dietary options, we conducted a survey to determine the levels of awareness regarding the high phosphate content in commercially processed food and drinks among medical and nursing students at the Hirosaki University School of Medicine in Japan. For this survey, 190 medical and nursing students (average age 21.7±3 years) were randomly selected, and provided with a list of questions aimed at evaluating their awareness of food and drinks containing artificially added phosphate ingredients. While 98.9% of these students were aware of the presence of sugar in commercially available soda drinks, only 6.9% were aware of the presence of phosphate (phosphoric acid). Similarly, only 11.6% of these students were aware of the presence of phosphate in commercially processed food, such as hamburgers and pizza. Moreover, around two thirds of the surveyed students (67.7%) were unaware of the harmful effects of unrestricted consumption of phosphate-containing food and drinks. About 28% of the surveyed students consume such “fast food” once a week, while 40% drink at least 1∼5 cans of soda drinks/week. After realizing the potential long-term risks of consuming excessive phosphate-containing food and drinks, 40.5% of the survey participants considered reducing their phosphate intake by minimizing the consumption of commercially processed “fast food” items and soda drinks. Moreover, another 48.4% of students showed interest in obtaining more information on the negative health effects of consuming excessive amounts of phosphate. This survey emphasizes the need for educational initiative to raise awareness of the health risks posed by excessive consumption of phosphate additives."

When the Cdc7 function is impaired in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), the absence of Cdc7 kinase leads to S-phase arrest, which generates DNA structure checkpoint signals resulting in recombinational repair and eventual p53-dependent cell death (28.Kim J.M. Nakao K. Nakamura K. Saito I. Katsuki M. Arai K. Masai H. Inactivation of Cdc7 kinase in mouse ES cells results in S-phase arrest and p53-dependent cell death.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2168-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Interestingly, TGF-β can stimulate SMC differentiation and proliferation of 10T1/2 cells simultaneously and up-regulates Cdc7 expression. We thus hypothesize that Cdc7 is one of the TGF-β downstream targets mediating both the differentiation and proliferation of 10T1/2 cells. Indeed, in the present study we identified Cdc7 as an important regulator in SMC differentiation in addition to its function in proliferation. Cdc7 is up-regulated and activated along with the expression of SMC markers in 10T1/2 cells. Both gain and loss of function studies showed that Cdc7 had a dramatic effect on the transcription and protein expression of early SMC markers. Importantly, Cdc7 promoted the initiation of SMC differentiation by a mechanism distinct from the proliferation. Moreover, we found that Cdc7 functionally and physically interacted with TGF-β downstream signaling molecule Smad3 to facilitate Smad3 binding to SMC marker promoter, leading to the activation of SMC marker gene transcription. C3H10T1/2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% glutamine. Cells were grown in serum-free medium for 16–24 h followed by incubation with TGF-β (5 ng/ml) for various times as needed. For transfections, cells were cultured in 12- or 6-well plates or 6-cm dishes, and transfected 24 h after plating with an 80 to 90% confluence using Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. In Cdc7 inhibition experiments, cells were pretreated with the 10 μm Cdc7 inhibitor PHA767491 (Tocris) for 2 h before incubation with TGF-β. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) target sequence for Dbf4 was GCC CAC AAC CTA TTC TTC AGC TGGA. Double-stranded DNA coding Dbf4 shRNAs were cloned into pRNAT-H1.1/Adeno shuttle vector (Genscript). Adenovirus was packaged in 293 cells (Agilent) and purified by CsCl2 gradient ultracentrifugation, as previously described (29.Wang J.N. Shi N. Xie W.B. Guo X. Chen S.Y. Response gene to complement 32 promotes vascular lesion formation through stimulation of smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2011; 31: e19-e26Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For adenoviral transduction, 10T1/2 cells were transduced with 100 multiplicity of infection of control or shRNA adenovirus for 48 to 72 h. 10T1/2 cells were cultured on sterile coverslips and treated with TGF-β. Cells were then fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 5 min followed by methanol for 10 min at −20 °C for Smad3, phospho-Cdc7, and α-SMA staining. Anti-phospho-Cdc7 antibody was used at 1:200 in blocking buffer consisting of 3% BSA in PBS. Smad3 and α-SMA antibodies were used at 1:100. Cells were then incubated with FITC- or TRITC-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:100 and 1:50, respectively). Stained cells were imaged with a Nikon Eclipse 90i microscope and images were captured with a Nikon 12.7MP digital Sight DS-Ri1 color camera. 5 × 103 cells/well were cultured in 96-well plates and treated as indicated. 10 μl of MTT reagent (R&D) was added to the medium and incubated in a CO2 incubator for 3 h, and then 100 μl of detergent (R&D) was added and incubated at 37 °C for additional 2 h. Absorbance (A) was measured at 570 nm wavelength with a plate reader (Bio-Tek). The A values of the medium containing no cells were used as the blank control. Total RNA from cultured cells was extracted using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Reverse transcription was performed using an iScript cDNA Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). qPCR was performed in the Mx3005P qPCR machine using SYBR Green master mix (Agilent Technologies). Each sample was amplified in triplicate. Primers for the qPCR were as follows. Cdc7: 5′-TTG CAG CAG AGC TTC AGT GT-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAA TTG CTG GGC TTC ACA TC-3′ (reverse); Dbf4: 5′-CAG GAG CCT CAT GAG TGT GA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCT CGC TTG TCT GAA AAA GG-3′ (reverse). The primers used for SMC markers were described previously (12.Chen S. Lechleider R.J. Transforming growth factor-β-induced differentiation of smooth muscle from a neural crest stem cell line.Circ.

Antibodies used were: anti-Cdc7 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phospho-Cdc7 (CycLex), anti-α-SMA (Abcam), anti-SM22α (Abcam), anti-Calponin1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-α-tubulin (Cell Signaling), anti-Dbf4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cells were washed two times with PBS, followed by protein extraction using RIPA buffer (50 mmol/liters Tris-HCI, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.25% w/v sodium deoxycholate, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 1 mmol/liter EGTA, 0.1% SDS, protease inhibitors, phosphatase inhibitors). Protein concentration was measured using BCA Protein Assay Reagent (Thermo Scientific). 5 or 10 μg of the lysates was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF (Bio-Rad) or nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk for regular antibodies or 5% BSA for anti-phospho antibodies, and then incubated with primary antibodies in blocking buffer for 1 to 2 h followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h (Sigma). Detection was performed with enhanced chemiluminescence (Millipore). α-SMA or SM22α promoter constructs were co-transfected into 10T1/2 cells with other plasmids as described previously (22.Li F. Luo Z. Huang W. Lu Q. Wilcox C.S. Jose P.A. Chen S. Response gene to complement 32, a novel regulator for transforming growth factor-β-induced smooth muscle differentiation of neural crest cells.J.

Luciferase assay was performed using Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). Experiments were repeated at least three times, and the results from representative experiments are shown with standard deviations. ChIP assays were performed as described previously (30.Kawai-Kowase K. Kumar M.S. Hoofnagle M.H. Yoshida T. Owens G.K. PIAS1 activates the expression of smooth muscle cell differentiation marker genes by interacting with serum response factor and class I basic helix-loop-helix proteins.Mol.

Chromatin complexes were immunoprecipitated with 3 μg of Smad3 antibody or IgG (negative control). Semi-quantitative PCR was performed to amplify the SM22α promoter region containing Smad binding element (SBE) using the following primer set: 5′-GGT GTT GAG CCA AGC AGA C-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGA GTT GCA TTA GCC CTG G-3′ (reverse) (31.Qiu P. Ritchie R.P. Fu Z. Cao D. Cumming J. Miano J.M. Wang D.Z. Li H.J. Li L. Myocardin enhances Smad3-mediated transforming growth factor-β1 signaling in a CArG box-independent manner: Smad-binding element is an important cis element for SM22α transcription in vivo.Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 983-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). All values are expressed as mean ± S.E. Data were analyzed using ANOVA with pairwise comparisons between groups. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. TGF-β is known to be an important determinant for SMC lineage. Whether or not TGF-β coordinates both the proliferation and SMC differentiation, a unique phenomenon observed during embryonic development, however, remains to be determined. We found that TGF-β stimulated both the proliferation (Fig. 1A) and SMC differentiation of the embryonic mesenchymal 10T1/2 cells (Fig. 1, B–F) in the early phase of the induction (24 h), indicating that the initiation of SMC differentiation and proliferation occur simultaneously, which mimics the process found in the early embryonic development. Interestingly, cell cycle regulator Cdc7 expression was significantly increased along with the activation of SMC early markers (Fig. 1B). TGF-β induced a 4-fold increase of Cdc7 expression after 24 h of treatment (Fig. 1C). These data suggest that Cdc7 may be involved in both the proliferation and TGF-β-induced early SMC differentiation. As a kinase, Cdc7 is activated via phosphorylation at residue Thr-376 (26.Masai H. Matsui E. You Z. Ishimi Y. Tamai K. Arai K. Human Cdc7-related kinase complex. In vitro phosphorylation of MCM by concerted actions of Cdks and Cdc7 and that of a criticial threonine residue of Cdc7 bY Cdks.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29042-29052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To determine if TGF-β activates Cdc7, we examined the time-dependent phosphorylation of Cdc7. As shown in Fig. 2A, Cdc7 was activated as early as 2 h after TGF-β treatment, which was prior to the activation of SMC early marker α-SMA, SM22α or calponin (Fig. 1, B–F). Cdc7 phosphorylation reached the highest level at 8 h after TGF-β induction (Fig. 2A). It appeared that TGF-β induced Cdc7 phosphorylation through p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and RhoA signaling pathways because both p38 and Rho kinase specific inhibitors blocked TGF-β-induced Cdc7 activation (Fig. 2B). To test if Cdc7 activation is required for TGF-β-induced SMC differentiation, we treated the serum-starved 10T1/2 cells with Cdc7-specific inhibitor PHA767491 in the presence of TGF-β. PHA767491 effectively blocked TGF-β-induced Cdc7 phosphorylation. Importantly, PHA767491 also blocked TGF-β-induced α-SMA, SM22α, and calponin expression by 51%, 69%, and 46%, respectively (Fig. 2, C and D), suggesting that Cdc7 plays an important role in TGF-β-induced SMC differentiation. Immunostaining of TGF-β-treated 10T1/2 cells confirmed that Cdc7 is required for TGF-β-induced SMC marker expression (supplemental Fig. S1). Cdc7 activity appeared to be essential for the α-actin filament reorganization and SMC morphology because PHA767491 inhibited α-SMA expression, reduced actin filament-formed stress fibers, and altered the morphology of TGF-β-induced cells (supplemental Fig. S1). In addition to its role in SMC marker expression, Cdc7 activity was also indispensible for TGF-β-induced cell proliferation. PHA767491 inhibited 10T1/2 cell growth in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2E). 5 or 10 μm of PHA767491 completely blocked the cell growth (Fig. 2E), consistent with its function in the initiation of DNA replication (25.Jackson A.L. Pahl P.M. Harrison K. Rosamond J. Sclafani R.A. Cell cycle regulation of the yeast Cdc7 protein kinase by association with the Dbf4 protein.Mol.

Targeting cell division cycle 7 kinase: a new approach for cancer therapy.Clin. Cancer Res. 2010; 16: 4503-4508Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These data suggest that Cdc7 mediates both the cell proliferation and SMC differentiation induced by TGF-β. Although PHA767491 blocks Cdc7 activation, it also has inhibitory activity against cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) with a higher IC50 (33.Anderson D.R. Meyers M.J. Vernier W.F. Mahoney M.W. Kurumbail R.G. Caspers N. Poda G.I. Schindler J.F. Reitz D.B. Mourey R.J. Pyrrolopyridine inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MK-2).J. Med. Chem. 2007; 50: 2647-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To prove that the inhibition of SMC differentiation by PHA767491 was due to the blockade of Cdc7 activity, we used Cdc7-specific shRNA to knockdown Cdc7 expression. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B and supplemental Figs. S2 and S3, knockdown of Cdc7 diminished TGF-β-induced protein expression of α-SMA, SM22α, and calponin in both 10T1/2 (Fig. 3A) and Monc-1 neural crest cells (Fig. 3B), demonstrating the essential role of Cdc7 in SMC differentiation. Cdc7 shRNA specifically targeted Cdc7 because it did not affect the expression of other key Cdc family members such as Cdc6 and Cdk9 (supplemental Fig. S2). Cdc6 also participates in the DNA replication (34.Jares P. Donaldson A. Blow J.J. The Cdc7/Dbf4 protein kinase: target of the S phase checkpoint?.EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 319-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). SMC differentiation is initiated by the activation of SMC marker gene transcription. To determine if Cdc7 is involved in the initiation process of SMC differentiation, we examined if Cdc7 regulates SMC marker gene promoter. We found that knockdown of Cdc7 markedly reduced TGF-β-induced α-SMA and SM22α promoter activity at various times of TGF-β treatment (Fig. 3, C and D). Cdc7 shRNA blocked α-SMA and SM22α promoter activity by 83 and 80%, respectively, at 8 h of TGF-β induction as compared with the control shRNA (Fig. 3, C and D). These results demonstrate that Cdc7 plays a critical role in the transcriptional activation of SMC marker genes during the initial phase of SMC differentiation. To further determine Cdc7 function in SMC differentiation, we tested if Cdc7 overexpression induces SMC marker gene expression. As shown in Fig. 4, A–E, forced expression of Cdc7 in 10T1/2 cells promoted α-SMA, SM22α, and calponin protein expression. These results indicate that Cdc7 alone is able to activate the SMC early markers. Dbf4 is the regulatory subunit of Cdc7. Cdc7 kinase activity is activated by Dbf4, which stimulates DNA replication and cell proliferation (34.Jares P. Donaldson A. Blow J.J. The Cdc7/Dbf4 protein kinase: target of the S phase checkpoint?.EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 319-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To test if Dbf4 is involved in Cdc7-induced SMC differentiation, we constructed adenoviral vector expressing Dbf4 shRNA. Dbf4 shRNA effectively blocked Dbf4 expression in 10T1/2 cells as assessed by both mRNA and protein expression (Fig. 5A). Knockdown of Dbf4 significantly diminished the growth of 10T1/2 cells (Fig. 5B), consistent with the biological activity of Dbf4 in cell cycle. Blockade of Dbf4, however, had no effect on Cdc7-induced expression of α-SMA, SM22α, or calponin (Fig. 5C). Dbf4 shRNA also did not interfere with Cdc7 expression (Fig. 5D). These data demonstrate that Cdc7-induced SMC differentiation is independent of Dbf4. To determine whether or not Cdc7-induced SMC marker gene expression was an indirect effect due to the altered cell cycle or cell density, we blocked TGF-β-induced cell proliferation using RO-3306, a specific inhibitor of another cell cycle regulator Cdk1. As shown in Fig. 5E, blockade of Cdk1 activation by RO-3306 effectively blocked TGF-β-induced cell growth, but did not alter TGF-β-induced SMC marker gene expression (Fig. 5F). These data further demonstrate that Cdc7-induced SMC differentiation is a process independent of cell cycle. Previous studies have established that Smad3 plays a major role in TGF-β-induced SMC differentiation of 10T1/2 cells (16.Chen S. Kulik M. Lechleider R.J. Smad proteins regulate transcriptional induction of the SM22α gene by TGF-β.Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1302-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 35.Qiu P. Feng X.H. Li L.

Although Smad2 also mediates TGF-β function, it is not involved in the differentiation of 10T1/2 cells (16.Chen S. Kulik M. Lechleider R.J.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 348: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Since knockdown of Cdc7 inhibited TGF-β-induced SMC differentiation (Fig. 3), we sought to determine how Cdc7 activity is linked to Smad3 function in TGF-β-mediated differentiation. To determine whether or not Cdc7-induced differentiation is related to Smad3 activity, we used both Smad3 shRNA (Fig. 6) and Smad3-selective inhibitor SIS3 (supplemental Fig. S4) to treat 10T1/2 cells with overexpression of Cdc7. Smad3 shRNA effectively knocked down Smad3 expression (Fig. 6A). Cdc7 significantly activated α-SMA, SM22α, and calponin mRNA expression (Fig. 6, B–E). Knockdown of Smad3 or SIS3, however, blocked the Cdc7-induced effects (Fig. 6, C–E and supplemental Fig. S4). Smad3 shRNA did not alter TGF-β-induced proliferation of 10T1/2 cells (Fig. 6F). These results indicate that Smad3 activity is essential for Cdc7 induction of SMC differentiation. Because Cdc7 function in SMC differentiation relies on Smad3 activity, we sought to determine if Cdc7 interacts with Smad3. Co-IP assay with endogenous proteins extracted from 10T1/2 cells treated with or without TGF-β showed that Cdc7 was coimmunoprecicipated with Smad3 (Fig. 7A), and Smad3 was coimmunoprecipitated with Cdc7 (Fig. 7B), suggesting that Cdc7 physically interacts with Smad3 in 10T1/2 cells. TGF-β induction appeared to enhance their interaction (Fig. 7, A and B). To test whether or not the physical interaction between Cdc7 and Smad3 has functional significance, we co-transfected Smad3 and Cdc7 expression plasmids individually or in combination with α-SMA or SM22α promoter construct into 10T1/2 cells. Promoter analyses showed that Cdc7 significantly increased Smad3-mediated promoter activity even in the basal states (Fig. 7, C and D). TGF-β induction markedly enhanced Smad3 activity, which was dramatically augmented by Cdc7 (Fig. 7, C and D). These results demonstrate that Cdc7 interacts with Smad3 both physically and functionally to induce SMC marker promoter activity. Smad3 regulates SMC differentiation by binding to SBE in SMC marker gene promoter (31.Qiu P. Ritchie R.P. Fu Z. Cao D. Cumming J. Miano J.M. Wang D.Z. Li H.J. Li L. Myocardin enhances Smad3-mediated transforming growth factor-β1 signaling in a CArG box-independent manner: Smad-binding element is an important cis element for SM22α transcription in vivo.Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 983-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To further explore the mechanism underlying Cdc7 function in SMC differentiation, we tested if Cdc7 plays a role in Smad3 interaction with SMC marker gene promoter. Previous studies have shown that Smad3 binding to a SBE that is functionally important to SM22α promoter activity both in vitro and in vivo (16.Chen S. Kulik M. Lechleider R.J. Smad proteins regulate transcriptional induction of the SM22α gene by TGF-β.Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1302-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 31.Qiu P. Ritchie R.P. Fu Z. Cao D.

Smad-dependent and Smad-independent pathways in TGF-β family signaling.Nature. 2003; 425: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (4267) Google Scholar). To determine if Cdc7 affects Smad3 binding to this SBE, ChIP assay was performed. We found that Smad3 weakly bound to the SBE in the basal state (Fig. 8A); TGF-β increased the binding of Smad3 to SM22α promoter (Fig. 8, A and B). shRNA knockdown of Cdc7, however, significantly attenuated the TGF-β-enhanced Smad3 binding to the promoter (Fig. 8, A and B), indicating that Cdc7 is essential for Smad3 binding to SMC marker gene promoter in TGF-β-induced SMC differentiation. Functionally, knockdown of Cdc7 inhibited TGF-β/Smad3-mediated α-SMA and SM22α promoter activity by 49 and 51%, respectively, (Fig. 8, C and D), suggesting that Cdc7-mediated Smad3 binding is critical for the transcriptional activation of SMC markers. To determine how Cdc7 enhances Smad3 binding to SBE in SMC marker gene promoter, we first detected if Cdc7 affects Smad3 phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 9A, Cdc7 inhibitor PHA767491 did not alter Smad3 phosphorylation. However, PHA767491 inhibited TGF-β-induced Smad3 nuclear translocation (Fig. 9B), suggesting that Cdc7 may regulate Smad3 nuclear location independent of Smad3 phosphorylation. Previous studies demonstrate that Smad3 nuclear location is controlled by Smad nuclear retention factor tafazzin (TAZ) (38.Varelas X. Sakuma R. Samavarchi-Tehrani P. Peerani R. Rao B.M. Dembowy J. Yaffe M.B. Zandstra P.W. Wrana J.L. TAZ controls Smad nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and regulates human embryonic stem-cell self-renewal.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). We found that TGF-β induced TAZ mRNA expression in 10T1/2 cells in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 9C). Importantly, PHA767491 blocked TGF-β-induced TAZ mRNA expression (Fig. 9D), suggesting that Cdc7 may enhance Smad3 binding to SBE via regulating TAZ expression level, by either the enhanced transcription or mRNA stability. Exit from cell cycle into G1/G0 is considered as a necessary, or at least frequent, prelude to differentiation of different cell types (39.Sachs L. Constitutive uncoupling of pathways of gene expression that control growth and differentiation in myeloid leukemia: a model for the origin and progression of malignancy.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Dev. 1997; 7: 597-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Several other studies, on the other hand, have found that differentiation and cell proliferation can be regulated simultaneously (40.Maione R. Amati P. Interdependence between muscle differentiation and cell-cycle control.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: M19-M30PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Brown G. Hughes P.J. Michell R.H.

Regulation of myeloid growth and differentiation by the insulin-like growth factor I receptor.Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 362-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). During embryonic development, SMC differentiation and proliferation also occur concurrently. The molecular mechanisms, especially the genes or protein factors that regulate both proliferation and differentiation, however, remain largely unknown. Our present studies have shown that during the initial phase of SMC differentiation of 10T1/2 cells (within 24 h of TGF-β treatment), TGF-β induces both the proliferation and differentiation of the progenitor cells simultaneously. Thus, TGF-β stimulation of 10T1/2 cells is an ideal model to study the molecular mechanisms underlying the synchronization of these two different cellular processes. Cell cycle regulators have the potential to regulate both the proliferation and differentiation. Our studies have revealed that cell cycle regulator Cdc7 is able to regulate both proliferation and differentiation of SMC progenitor 10T1/2 cells. Cdc7 is induced and activated by TGF-β along with the proliferation and differentiation of 10T1/2 cells. Blockade of Cdc7 activity through inhibition of its phosphorylation or knockdown of Cdc7 expression attenuates both the proliferation and SMC differentiation. Cdc7 itself appears to be able to induce SMC marker gene expression to a much lesser extent as compared with TGF-β induction (Fig. 4 versus Fig. 1), indicating that other factors such as Smad3 are required for TGF-β-induced SMC differentiation. Cdc7 appears to regulate SMC differentiation by modulating SMC marker gene transcription. Knockdown of Cdc7 dramatically blocks the promoter activities of SMC early marker genes α-SMA and SM22α. Cdc7 function in the transcription requires intact Smad3 activity because knockdown of Smad3 or blockade of Smad3 activation by Smad3-selective inhibitor markedly inhibits Cdc7-induced mRNA expression of SMC markers. Mechanistically, Cdc7 physically interacts with Smad3 to promote Smad3 binding to SBE in the promoter of SMC marker genes, leading to activation of marker gene transcription. Knockdown of Cdc7 impairs Smad3 binding to SBE, resulting in the attenuation of SMC marker promoter activity and transcription. Interestingly, Cdc7 does not affect Smad3 phosphorylation but regulates Smad3 nuclear location, which is due to Cdc7 function in regulating the expression or stability of Smad nuclear retention factor TAZ. Cdc7 regulates cell proliferation and SMC differentiation through distinct mechanisms. Dbf4, the catalytic subunit of Cdc7 and key regulator of cell cycle, is not important for SMC differentiation because shRNA knockdown of Dbf4 has no effect on SMC marker gene expression. However, Dbf4 is critical for proliferation of 10T1/2 cells. Based on our results in 10T1/2 cells, Cdc7 appears to coordinate the proliferation and SMC differentiation simultaneously via the following two distinct mechanisms: Upon TGF-β stimulation, both Cdc7 and Smad3 are induced and/or activated, and translocated into nuclei where Cdc7 regulates Smad3 binding to SBE on SMC marker gene promoter via physically interacting with Smad3 and enhancing TAZ expression level, leading to the activation of SMC marker transcription and SMC differentiation. When Cdc7 binds to Dbf4 and origin recognition complex (ORC), DNA replication will be activated, leading to cell proliferation and growth (Fig 10). In summary, we have identified a novel role of Cdc7 in regulating SMC differentiation in addition to its role in cell proliferation. Cdc7 is likely to be one of many factors that simultaneously control cell proliferation and SMC differentiation. Whether Cdc7 facilitates these two processes during embryonic development will be an important and interesting area for future study. Download .pdf (.36 MB) Help with pdf files"

Although many studies have evaluated NF-κB activity following exposure to oxidative stress, the role of the IκB family of inhibitory proteins in modulating this activity remains unclear. Specifically, the function of IκBβ in mediating the cellular response to oxidative stress has not been evaluated. We hypothesized that blocking oxidative stress-induced NF-κB signaling through IκBβ would prevent apoptotic cell death. Using IκBβ knock-in mice (AKBI), in which the IκBα gene is replaced with the IκBβ cDNA, we show that IκBβ overexpression prevented oxidative stress-induced apoptotic cell death. This was associated with retention of NF-κB subunits in the nucleus and maintenance of NF-κB activity. Furthermore, the up-regulation of pro-apoptotic genes in WT murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) exposed to serum starvation was abrogated in AKBI MEFs. Inhibition of apoptosis was observed in WT MEFs overexpressing IκBβ with simultaneous IκBα knockdown, whereas IκBβ overexpression alone did not produce this effect. These findings represent a necessary but not sufficient role of IκBβ in preventing oxidant stress-induced cell death.

https://openalex.org/W2088258490,"As part of a program to select maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) genotypes for resistance to low winter temperatures, we examined variation in photosystem II activity by chlorophyll fluorescence. Populations and families within populations from contrasting climates were tested during two consecutive winters through two progeny trials, one located at a continental and xeric site and one at a mesic site with Atlantic influence. We also obtained the LT50, or the temperature that causes 50% damage, by controlled freezing and the subsequent analysis of chlorophyll fluorescence in needles and stems that were collected from populations at the continental trial site. P. pinaster showed sensitivity to winter stress at the continental site, during the colder winter. The combination of low temperatures, high solar irradiation and low precipitation caused sustained decreases in maximal photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm), quantum yield of non-cyclic electron transport (ΦPSII) and photochemical quenching (qP). The variation in photochemical parameters was larger among families than among populations, and population differences appeared only under the harshest conditions at the continental site. As expected, the environmental effects (winter and site) on the photochemical parameters were much larger than the genotypic effects (population or family). LT50 was closely related to the minimum winter temperatures of the population's range. The dark-adapted Fv/Fm ratio discriminated clearly between interior and coastal populations. In conclusion, variations in Fv/Fm, ΦPSII, qP and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) in response to winter stress were primarily due to the differences between the winter conditions and the sites and secondarily due to the differences among families and their interactions with the environment. Populations from continental climates showed higher frost tolerance (LT50) than coastal populations that typically experience mild winters. Therefore, LT50, as estimated by Fv/Fm, is a reliable indicator of frost tolerance among P. pinaster populations."

Systemic and mucosal pegylated IFN-alpha administration induced expression of the interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) MxA and OAS in the airways. RM treated with IFN-alpha 24 hours prior to influenza virus challenge had significantly lower peak vRNA levels in the trachea compared to untreated animals. In addition to blunting viral replication, IFN-alpha treatment minimized the weight loss and spike in body temperature after influenza infection of RM. These results confirm the importance of IFN-alpha induced innate immune responses in the rapid control of influenza A virus replication in primates."
https://openalex.org/W2090745274,"Local adaptation of parasites to their hosts due to coevolution is a central prediction of many theories in evolutionary biology. However, empirical studies looking for parasite local adaptation show great variation in outcomes, and the reasons for such variation are largely unknown. In a previous study, we showed adaptive differentiation in the arctiid moth Utetheisa ornatrix to its host plant, the pyrrolizidine alkaloid-bearing legume Crotalaria pallida, at the continental scale, but found no differentiation at the regional scale. In the present study, we sampled the same sites to investigate factors that may contribute to the lack of differentiation at the regional scale. We performed field observations that show that specialist and non-specialist polyphagous herbivore incidence varies among populations at both scales. With a series of common-garden experiments we show that some plant traits that may affect herbivory (pyrrolizidine alkaloids and extrafloral nectaries) vary at the regional scale, while other traits (trichomes and nitrogen content) just vary at the continental scale. These results, combined with our previous evidence for plant population differentiation based on larval performance on fresh fruits, suggest that U. ornatrix is subjected to divergent selection even at the regional scale. Finally, with a microsatellite study we investigated population structure of U. ornatrix. We found that population structure is not stable over time: we found population differentiation at the regional scale in the first year of sampling, but not in the second year. Unstable population structure of the herbivore is the most likely cause of the lack of regional adaptation."

https://openalex.org/W1983669367,"Activation of embryonic signaling pathways quiescent in the adult pancreas is a feature of pancreatic cancer (PC). These discoveries have led to the development of novel inhibitors of pathways such as Notch and Hedgehog signaling that are currently in early phase clinical trials in the treatment of several cancer types. Retinoid signaling is also essential for pancreatic development, and retinoid therapy is used successfully in other malignancies such as leukemia, but little is known concerning retinoid signaling in PC.We investigated the role of retinoid signaling in vitro and in vivo in normal pancreas, pancreatic injury, regeneration and cancer. Retinoid signaling is active in occasional cells in the adult pancreas but is markedly augmented throughout the parenchyma during injury and regeneration. Both chemically induced and genetically engineered mouse models of PC exhibit a lack of retinoid signaling activity compared to normal pancreas. As a consequence, we investigated Cellular Retinoid Binding Protein 1 (CRBP1), a key regulator of retinoid signaling known to play a role in breast cancer development, as a potential therapeutic target. Loss, or significant downregulation of CRBP1 was present in 70% of human PC, and was evident in the very earliest precursor lesions (PanIN-1A). However, in vitro gain and loss of function studies and CRBP1 knockout mice suggested that loss of CRBP1 expression alone was not sufficient to induce carcinogenesis or to alter PC sensitivity to retinoid based therapies.In conclusion, retinoid signalling appears to play a role in pancreatic regeneration and carcinogenesis, but unlike breast cancer, it is not mediated directly by CRBP1."
https://openalex.org/W2023870689,"Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) is the mammalian endogenous nitric oxide (NO) receptor. The mechanisms of activation and deactivation of this heterodimeric enzyme are unknown. For deciphering them, functional domains can be overexpressed. We have probed the dynamics of the diatomic ligands NO and CO within the isolated heme domain β(1)(190) of human sGC by piconanosecond absorption spectroscopy. After photo-excitation of nitrosylated sGC, only NO geminate rebinding occurs in 7.5 ps. In β(1)(190), both photo-dissociation of 5c-NO and photo-oxidation occur, contrary to sGC, followed by NO rebinding (7 ps) and back-reduction (230 ps and 2 ns). In full-length sGC, CO geminate rebinding to the heme does not occur. In contrast, CO geminately rebinds to β(1)(190) with fast multiphasic process (35, 171, and 18 ns). We measured the bimolecular association rates k(on) = 0.075 ± 0.01 × 10(6) M(-1) · S(-1) for sGC and 0.83 ± 0.1 × 10(6) M(-1) · S(-1) for β(1)(190). These different dynamics reflect conformational changes and less proximal constraints in the isolated heme domain with respect to the dimeric native sGC. We concluded that the α-subunit and the β(1)(191-619) domain exert structural strains on the heme domain. These strains are likely involved in the transmission of the energy and relaxation toward the activated state after Fe(2+)-His bond breaking. This also reveals the heme domain plasticity modulated by the associated domains and subunit."

Knockout of 5LO has previously been shown to alter anxiety-like behavior in mice at a young age but the effect of 5LO knockout on older animals has not been characterized.Here we used the elevated plus maze behavioral paradigm to measure anxiety-like behavior in female mice lacking 5LO (5LO-KO) at three different ages. Adolescent 5LO-KO animals did not significantly differ from wild-type (WT) animals in anxiety-like behavior. However, adult and older mice exhibited increased anxiety-like behavior compared to WT controls.These results indicate that 5LO plays a role in the development of the anxiety-like phenotype in an age-dependent manner in female mice. Future work should further investigate this interaction as 5LO may prove to be an important molecular target for the development of novel anxiolytic therapies."

Here, we aim to contribute to the catalogue of human genomic variation by investigating the variation in number and content of minimal absent words within a species, using four human genome assemblies. We compare the reference human genome GRCh37 assembly, the HuRef assembly of the genome of Craig Venter, the NA12878 assembly from cell line GM12878, and the YH assembly of the genome of a Han Chinese individual. We find the variation in number and content of minimal absent words between assemblies more significant for large and very large minimal absent words, where the biases of sequencing and assembly methodologies become more pronounced. Moreover, we find generally greater similarity between the human genome assemblies sequenced with capillary-based technologies (GRCh37 and HuRef) than between the human genome assemblies sequenced with massively parallel technologies (NA12878 and YH). Finally, as expected, we find the overall variation in number and content of minimal absent words within a species to be generally smaller than the variation between species."

Understanding how mitotic cells integrate directional cues is therefore an important question in embryogenesis. Here, we investigate the effect of dynamic shear forces on confined mitotic cells. We found that human epithelial cells (hTERT-RPE1) as well as MC3T3 osteoblasts align their mitotic spindle perpendicular to the external force. Spindle orientation appears to be a consequence of cell elongation along the zero-force direction in response to the dynamic shear. This process is a nonlinear response to the strain amplitude, requires actomyosin activity and correlates with redistribution of myosin II. Mechanosteered cells divide normally, suggesting that this mechanism is compatible with biological functions."
https://openalex.org/W2063476718,"Background A mechanistic codon substitution model, in which each codon substitution rate is proportional to the product of a codon mutation rate and the average fixation probability depending on the type of amino acid replacement, has advantages over nucleotide, amino acid, and empirical codon substitution models in evolutionary analysis of protein-coding sequences. It can approximate a wide range of codon substitution processes. If no selection pressure on amino acids is taken into account, it will become equivalent to a nucleotide substitution model. If mutation rates are assumed not to depend on the codon type, then it will become essentially equivalent to an amino acid substitution model. Mutation at the nucleotide level and selection at the amino acid level can be separately evaluated. Results The present scheme for single nucleotide mutations is equivalent to the general time-reversible model, but multiple nucleotide changes in infinitesimal time are allowed. Selective constraints on the respective types of amino acid replacements are tailored to each gene in a linear function of a given estimate of selective constraints. Their good estimates are those calculated by maximizing the respective likelihoods of empirical amino acid or codon substitution frequency matrices. Akaike and Bayesian information criteria indicate that the present model performs far better than the other substitution models for all five phylogenetic trees of highly-divergent to highly-homologous sequences of chloroplast, mitochondrial, and nuclear genes. It is also shown that multiple nucleotide changes in infinitesimal time are significant in long branches, although they may be caused by compensatory substitutions or other mechanisms. The variation of selective constraint over sites fits the datasets significantly better than variable mutation rates, except for 10 slow-evolving nuclear genes of 10 mammals. An critical finding for phylogenetic analysis is that assuming variable mutation rates over sites lead to the overestimation of branch lengths."

https://openalex.org/W1984171923,"Histamine regulates arousal, circadian rhythms, and thermoregulation. Activation of H3 histamine receptors expressed by preoptic GABAergic neurons results in a decrease of their firing rate and hyperthermia. Here we report that an increase in the A-type K+ current in preoptic GABAergic neurons in response to activation of H3 histamine receptors results in decreased firing rate and hyperthermia in mice. The Kv4.2 subunit is required for these actions in spite of the fact that Kv4.2−/− preoptic GABAergic neurons display A-type currents and firing characteristics similar to those of wild-type neurons. This electrical remodeling is achieved by robust upregulation of the expression of the Kv4.1 subunit and of a delayed rectifier current. Dynamic clamp experiments indicate that enhancement of the A-type current by a similar amount to that induced by histamine is sufficient to mimic its robust effect on firing rates. These data indicate a central role played by the Kv4.2 subunit in histamine regulation of body temperature and its interaction with pERK1/2 downstream of the H3 receptor. We also reveal that this pathway provides a mechanism for selective modulation of body temperature at the beginning of the active phase of the circadian cycle."
