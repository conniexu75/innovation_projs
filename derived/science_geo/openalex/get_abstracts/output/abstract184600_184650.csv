https://openalex.org/W2077209766,"Three sequential phases of mitochondrial calcium accumulation can be distinguished: matrix dehydrogenase regulation, buffering of extramitochondrial free calcium, and finally activation of the permeability transition. Relationships between these phases, free and total matrix calcium concentration, and phosphate concentration are investigated in rat liver and brain mitochondria. Slow, continuous calcium infusion is employed to avoid transient bioenergetic consequences of bolus additions. Liver and brain mitochondria undergo permeability transitions at precise matrix calcium loads that are independent of infusion rate. Cytochrome c release precedes the permeability transition. Cyclosporin A enhances the loading capacity in the presence or absence of acetoacetate. A remarkably constant free matrix calcium concentration, in the range 1–5 μm as monitored by matrix-loaded fura2-FF, was observed when total matrix calcium was increased from 10 to at least 500 nmol of calcium/mg of protein. Increasing phosphate decreased both the free matrix calcium and the matrix calcium-loading capacity. Thus the permeability transition is not triggered by a critical matrix free calcium concentration. The rate of hydrogen peroxide detection by Amplex Red decreased during calcium infusion arguing against a role for oxidative stress in permeability pore activation in this model. A transition between a variable and buffered matrix free calcium concentration occurred at 10 nmol of total matrix calcium/mg protein. The solubility product of amorphous Ca3(PO4)2 is consistent with the observed matrix free calcium concentration, and the matrix pH is proposed to play the major role in maintaining the low matrix free calcium concentration.

Isolated mitochondria from a variety of sources possess a large but finite capacity to accumulate and retain Ca2+ (for reviews see Refs. 1Nicholls D.G. Åkerman K.E.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 683: 57-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar and 2Gunter T.E. Gunter K.K. Sheu S.-S. Gavin C.E. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1994; 267: C313-C339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When this limit is exceeded, mitochondria assemble a pore in their inner membrane that is non-selectively permeable to ions and solutes up to 1.4 kDa (for review see Ref. 3Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). It is unclear what exactly defines Ca2+ overload and how this triggers the permeability transition. Phosphate (Pi) is required for massive Ca2+ loading of the matrix and a variety of evidence suggests that a calcium phosphate complex is formed within the matrix once about 10 nmol of Ca2+/mg has been accumulated. First, phosphate is required for extensive matrix Ca2+ loading that can exceed 1 m total Ca2+ concentration before swelling can be observed (1Nicholls D.G. Åkerman K.E.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 683: 57-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 2Gunter T.E. Gunter K.K. Sheu S.-S. Gavin C.E. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1994; 267: C313-C339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, over a wide range of total matrix Ca2+ (ΣCa2+m) 1The abbreviations used are: ΣCa2+m, total matrix Ca2+; [Ca2+]m, matrix free Ca2+ concentration; [Ca2+]e, extramitochondrial free Ca2+ concentration; Ksp, solubility product; CaG5N, Calcium Green 5N, TMRM+, tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester; RLM, rat liver mitochondria; RBM, rat brain mitochondria; BSA, bovine serum albumin; Tes, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: ΣCa2+m, total matrix Ca2+; [Ca2+]m, matrix free Ca2+ concentration; [Ca2+]e, extramitochondrial free Ca2+ concentration; Ksp, solubility product; CaG5N, Calcium Green 5N, TMRM+, tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester; RLM, rat liver mitochondria; RBM, rat brain mitochondria; BSA, bovine serum albumin; Tes, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid. the activity of the Ca2+ efflux pathways in both liver and brain mitochondria are inversely related to the free Pi concentration but independent of ΣCa2+m, consistent with a matrix free Ca2+, [Ca2+]m, that is governed by the solubility product of a calcium phosphate complex and is suboptimal for maximal activity of the efflux pathways of liver or brain mitochondria (4Nicholls D.G. Scott I.D. Biochem. J. 1980; 186: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 5Zoccarato F. Nicholls D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 127: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Third, mitochondria can maintain a remarkably constant setpoint when ΣCa2+m is varied widely (6Nicholls D.G. Biochem. J. 1978; 176: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), indicating that the activity of the efflux pathway, and hence [Ca2+]m, is not varying. Fourth, mitochondria accumulating Ca2+ in the presence of excess phosphate extrude 1 H+ per Ca2+ accumulated, consistent with the formation of Ca3(PO4)2 in the matrix (7Lehninger A.L. Carafoli E. Rossi C.S. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1967; 29: 259-320PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, Pi-depleted mitochondria in the presence of acetate as permeant anion show an increasing efflux activity with increasing Ca2+ load and fail to maintain a setpoint that is independent of ΣCa2+m (4Nicholls D.G. Scott I.D. Biochem. J. 1980; 186: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).All of these observations are consistent with a matrix Ca2+ phosphate complex that obeys mass-action relationships to maintain a low [Ca2+]m. However, any complex must be freely reversible, since the physiological complex is capable of dissociating into Ca2+ and Pi immediately following mitochondrial depolarization, allowing the two ions to exit the mitochondrion on their individual carriers (5Zoccarato F. Nicholls D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 127: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).Mitochondrial Ca2+ loading has almost invariably been investigated by the addition of one or more bolus additions of Ca2+, each of which induces a non-steady-state condition in which mitochondrial respiration, membrane potential and redox status change with time. Even multiple, relatively small, Ca2+ additions result in repetitive partial mitochondrial depolarizations and bioenergetic demands. In addition, it is highly likely that the calcium phosphate complex formed in response to a rapid increase in [Ca2+]m following a bolus addition may differ from that formed when Ca2+ is slowly accumulated, since many forms of calcium phosphate are thermodynamically unstable and spontaneously interconvert (8Wuthier R.E. Rice G.S. Wallace J.E. Weaver R.L. LeGeros R.Z. Eanes E.D. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1985; 37: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).In this study we first investigate the capacity of liver and brain mitochondria to accumulate Ca2+ when the cation is slowly infused into the incubation, allowing the mitochondria to accumulate the cation continuously, with minimal bioenergetic demands. Second we monitor the matrix free Ca2+ concentrations during such loading in order to establish whether the supposed matrix buffering actually occurs, and finally we attempt to determine whether any relationship exists between matrix free Ca2+ and the initiation of the permeability transition.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies and Reagents—Calcium Green 5N (CaG5N), fura2-FFAM, tetramethylrhodamine methylester (TMRM), and Amplex Red were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Anti-cytochrome c (7HB) was obtained from BD PharMingen (San Diego, CA). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co.Preparation of Rat Liver Mitochondria (RLM)—Mitochondria were isolated from 6-week-old Wistar rats. The liver was homogenized in 125 mm sucrose, 125 mm mannitol, 5 mm Hepes, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.2 and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then centrifuged for 10 min at 8 000 × g at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was resuspended and centrifuged for 10 min at 8500 × g at 4 °C. The upper layer of this pellet was removed by gentle pipetting and the lower mitochondrial pellet resuspended in 0.5 ml of 250 mm sucrose, 16 μm BSA, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.2.Preparation of Rat Brain Mitochondria (RBM)—The cerebral cortices of two 6-week-old rats were rapidly removed into 20 ml of ice-cold isolation buffer (320 mm sucrose, 5 mm Tes, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.2) and homogenized. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 8500 × g for 10 min, and the resulting pellet resuspended in 1 ml of isolation buffer. This was layered onto a discontinuous gradient consisting of 1 ml of 6% Ficoll, 0.5 ml of 9% Ficoll, and 4.5 ml of 12% Ficoll (all prepared in isolation buffer) and centrifuged at 75,000 × g for 30 min. The myelin, synaptosomal, and free mitochondrial fractions formed respectively above the 6% layer, as a doublet within the 9% layer and as a pellet. The pellet was resuspended in 250 mm sucrose, 16 μm bovine serum albumin, 10 mm Tes, pH 7.2 and centrifuged at 8000 × g before being resuspended in this last buffer to 10–20 mg of protein/ml by the Bradford protein assay.Mitochondrial Ca2+ Accumulation—0.1 mg of mitochondrial protein was suspended in 2 ml of incubation medium (100 mm NaCl, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 1 μg/ml oligomycin, 2 mm sodium phosphate, and 0.5 mm ADP unless otherwise stated. A NaCl-based medium was used as this was shown in an earlier study (4Nicholls D.G. Scott I.D. Biochem. J. 1980; 186: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) to give optimal respiratory control. Experiments with RLM utilized 2 mm succinate as substrate in the presence of 1 μm rotenone; those with RBM utilized 5 mm glutamate plus 5 mm malate or 5 mm pyruvate plus 5 mm malate. Experiments were performed at 37 °C in stirred cuvettes in a PerkinElmer LS-50B fluorimeter. CaCl2 additions were made either as bolus additions or as gradual infusions with a Braun Perfusor (FT Scientific Instruments, Glos., UK) modified to take a Hamilton microsyringe (5Zoccarato F. Nicholls D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 127: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).Depletion of Endogenous Phosphate—Isolated mitochondria were depleted of endogenous phosphate by incubation with 1 mm glucose, 0.75 units/ml hexokinase, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glutamate, 5 mm malate,and 0.5 mm ADP in incubation medium at 37 °C for 5 min in the presence of substrate as previously described (5Zoccarato F. Nicholls D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 127: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).Mitochondrial Free Ca2+—RBM (0.1 mg of protein) were incubated in 25 μl of 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tes, 80 μm fura2-FF AM, 16 μm BSA, pH 7.2 on ice for 30 min and then at room temperature for 30 min. Any contaminating synaptosomes were permeabilized by addition of 1 ml of 250 mm sucrose, 16 μm albumin, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.2 containing 0.01% digitonin for the last 5 min of the incubation. The mitochondria were then centrifuged for 1 min at 10,000 × g, the pellet resuspended in 1 ml of 250 mm sucrose, 16 μm BSA, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.2 and recentrifuged. The pellet was finally resuspended in 20 μl of the same medium and used immediately.Estimation of [Ca]min Equilibrium with Amorphous Tricalcium Phosphate as a Function of pHm—The following dissociation constants were taken for phosphate, pK1 = 2.13, pK2 = 7.2, pK3 = 12.39 (10Larsen M.J. Arch. Oral Biol. 1986; 31: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A representative value for the Ksp for amorphous Ca3(PO4)2 of 3 × 10–30 was assumed, as published values from vary from 10–26 to 10–33. Equilibrium was assumed across the membrane via the phosphate carrier for an H2PO4−/OH− antiport (11Kramer R. Exp Physiol. 1998; 83: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). As the calculation was intended to show how [Ca2+]m in equilibrium with Ca3(PO4)2 could vary with pH and [Pi]e rather than report definitive values, no attempt was made to correct for activity coefficients of the charged species in the highly non-ideal conditions within the matrix.Mitochondrial Light Scattering, Membrane Potential, H2O2Production, and NAD(P) Pool Redox Status—All parameters were monitored in a stirred cuvette at 37 °C in the LS50B fluorimeter. Mitochondrial light scattering was monitored at 625 nm. Changes in membrane potential were followed qualitatively by the fluorescence quenching of tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (549 nm excitation, 575 nm emission). H2O2 production was monitored fluorimetrically with 1 μm Amplex Red and 0.75 units/ml horseradish peroxidase (563 nm excitation, 587 nm emission). Changes in NAD(P)H fluorescence were monitored at 350 nm excitation, 450 nm emission.Cytochrome c Release—Release of cytochrome c was monitored by removing 100-μl samples from the cuvette during an experiment and centrifuging to separate mitochondrial pellet and supernatant. Samples were separated and visualized by Western blotting. The blot was blocked with 5% albumin in TBS-Tween (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and then incubated with 1:2500 mouse anti-cytochrome c antibody in TBS-Tween plus 1% BSA followed by 1:2500 sheep anti-mouse antibody-horseradish peroxidase conjugate in TBS-Tween containing 1% BSA prior to enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection (Amersham Biosciences).RESULTSRat Liver Mitochondrial Ca2+-loading Capacity during Steady Ca2+ Infusion—The capacity of RLM to accumulate Ca2+ in the presence of phosphate, and ADP is dependent upon the mode of addition (Fig. 1). A single bolus addition of 450 nmol of Ca2+/mg initiates a permeability transition within 15 min, whereas 12 smaller additions of 50 nmol of Ca2+/mg can be made to a parallel preparation, while the steady infusion of Ca2+ at a rate of 85 nmol/mg/min allowed 800 nmol/mg to be accumulated before the permeability transition was observed.As previously demonstrated (5Zoccarato F. Nicholls D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 127: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) the steady infusion of Ca2+ into a mitochondrial incubation results in an initial increase in external Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]e) until the uniporter is sufficiently active to accumulate Ca2+ at a rate equal to that at which Ca2+ is being added to the external medium (i.e. the infusion rate plus the activity of the mitochondrial Ca2+ efflux pathway). Subsequently, and for as long as the activities of the uniporter and efflux pathway remain constant, Ca2+ is accumulated into the matrix at the same rate that it is delivered to the cuvette. The onset of the permeability transition is signaled by the increase in [Ca2+]e.A would be predicted from the catastrophic consequences of removing the proton-impermeability of the inner membrane, permeability pore opening in individual mitochondria is associated with a virtually instantaneous collapse of membrane potential (12Hüser J. Rechenmacher C.E. Blatter L.A. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2129-2137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 13Hüser J. Blatter L.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The resultant discharge of Ca2+ into the medium may trigger Ca2+ overload in adjacent mitochondria, leading to a chain reaction in which the entire mitochondrial population is seen to undergo the permeability transition in a short period of time. In order to minimize this effect in the present study, and also to ensure that anoxia did not occur during prolonged Ca2+ infusions, a very low mitochondrial protein concentration (0.05 mg/ml incubation) was used in most of these experiments.Changes in mitochondrial membrane potential, NAD(P)+ reduction, light scattering and cytochrome c retention were monitored in parallel with the Ca2+ infusion (Fig. 2). At the single mitochondrion level, the inner membrane permeabilization associated with the permeability transition results in an immediate collapse in membrane potential (13Hüser J. Blatter L.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and consequent loss of matrix Ca2+. A complicating factor therefore in conventional studies with mitochondrial populations is that this released Ca2+ can be taken up by adjacent mitochondria, either masking the initiation of the permeability transition, or triggering a chain reaction by inducing Ca2+ overload. Since the release of cytochrome c is an irreversible consquence of outer membrane rupture following the permeability transition, the experiment depicted in Fig. 2d, was performed to monitor the time course of release of the cytochrome during continuous infusion. Samples were taken from the cuvette during the Ca2+ infusion and rapidly centrifuged to pellet the mitochondria through silicone oil. Extensive cytochrome c release is first seen just before the massive release of matrix Ca2+ due to the permeability transition (sample iv). This suggests that a significant proportion of the mitochondria in the cuvette have undergone the transition by this stage. The modest increase in external free Ca2+ indicates that surrounding mitochondria accumulate Ca2+ from their depolarized neighbors, which would be predicted to facilitate in turn their depolarization and propagation of the transition throughout the incubation. A permeability transition-independent release of cytochrome c from rat brain mitochondria has been reported previously (14Andreyev A. Fahy E. Fiskum G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), although in that case it was induced by a single massive bolus addition of Ca2+ (3200 nmol/mg) and could therefore be due to transient osmotic swelling of the matrix prior to formation of the osmotically inactive calcium phosphate complex.Fig. 2ΔΨm loss, mitochondrial swelling, NAD(P)-pool reduction, and cytochrome c release during Ca2+ accumulation. Rat liver mitochondria suspensions were infused with Ca2+ as in Fig. 1c and simultaneous measurements were made of: membrane potential with 1 μm TMRM and 549/575 nm excitation/emission (a), mitochondrial swelling with light scattering at 625 nm (b), NAD(P) pool autofluorescence at 350/450 nm (c), or cytochrome c release by removing 100-μl samples (i–v) at the arrows (d), centrifuging to pellet the mitochondria and Western blotting the supernatants for cytochrome c. Note that the TMRM+ trace is inverted so that an upward deflection corresponds to an increase in membrane potential.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)No change in the extent of TMRM+ quenching could be detected until shortly before the onset of the permeability transition (Fig. 2a). In contrast to Ca2+, whose distribution is the consequence of a dynamic balance between independent uptake and efflux pathways, TMRM+ responds in a Nernstian manner to the membrane potential. A permeability transition in a fraction of the mitochondria is therefore not masked by reuptake of the membrane potential indicator by the residual mitochondria. For example, collapse in the membrane potential in 50% of the mitochondria would halve the aggregate matrix volume in which the TMRM+ is accumulated, releasing the probe and decreasing the quenching in the cuvette.Light scattering increased steadily during the infusion (Fig. 2b). Since this parameter is a function of the difference in refractive index between the matrix and medium, it is likely that what is being observed is an increase in matrix refractive index due to the formation of a calcium phosphate complex rather than a physical contraction of the matrix (14Andreyev A. Fahy E. Fiskum G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).NAD(P)H fluorescence also increases as Ca2+ is infused (Fig. 2c). As will be seen below (Fig. 8) [Ca2+]m is almost invariant over the range where the increased fluorescence signal is observed and so it is unlikely that the signal increases as a result of Ca2+-dependent substrate dehydrogenase activation (15Moreno S. Hansford R.G. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Since fluorescence is sensitive to the environment, it is equally possible that the fluorescence change reflects a change in matrix environment rather than increased reduction.Fig. 8Effect of matrix Ca2+ accumulation in the presence of Pi upon [Ca2+]m. RBM were loaded with fura2-FF as described under “Experimental Procedures.” a, fura2-FF-loaded mitochondria were added to 2 ml of 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm Hepes pH 7.2, 5 mm NaPO4, 0.5 mm ADP, 5 mm glutamate, 5 mm malate, 1 μg/ml oligomycin, and 0.2 μm CaG5N. CaCl2 was infused into this suspension and [Ca2+]m monitored. b, the above experiment was repeated monitoring [Ca2+]e. c, the ratio of bound/free Ca2+ in the matrix at any point was then calculated assuming a matrix volume of ∼1 μl/mg: (Ca infusedt – [Ca2+]et – [Ca2+]e0 – [Ca2+]mt)/[Ca2+]mt). Where Ca infusedt = the total amount of Ca2+ infused at time point t; [Ca2+]et = the extramitochondrial [Ca2+] at point t; [Ca2+]e0 = the initial extramitochondrial [Ca2+]; and [Ca2+]mt = the matrix free [Ca2+] at point t.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)By altering the speed of the infusion pump it is possible to determine whether the onset of the permeability transition is influenced by the rate or the extent of matrix Ca2+ loading. Varying the infusion rate from 42.5 to 170 nmol of Ca2+/mg/min had no effect upon the capacity of the liver mitochondria to accumulate Ca2+ (Fig. 3a). In the presence of the permeability transition inhibitor cyclosporin A (Fig. 3b) the capacity increased almost 3-fold and again seemed independent of the rate of infusion, although a slight decrease in capacity was observed for the slowest infusion.Fig. 3Effect of the rate of mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation and presence of CsA on Ca2+ accumulation capacity. Rat liver mitochondrial suspensions were infused with Ca2+ as in Fig. 1c at a rate of 170, 85, or 42.5 nmol/min/mg in the absence (a and c) or presence (b and d) of 1 μm cyclosporin A. Data was plotted as a function of time (a and b) or Ca2+ infusion (c and d).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Oxidation of RLM matrix NADH by acetoacetate in the absence of exogenous adenine nucleotides facilitates the permeability transition in response to bolus additions of Ca2+ (16Nicholls D.G. Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 1980; 188: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It has recently been reported (17Zago E.B. Castilho R.F. Vercesi A.E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) that acetoacetate activates a low conductance form of the permeability transition pore in RLM, that is sensitive to cyclosporin A and manifests itself as an increase in the rate of Ca2+ efflux observed following ruthenium red addition, but without a detectable loss of membrane potential. Under the present conditions, NADH oxidation induced by acetoacetate does not increase the steady-state rate of Ca2+ efflux from the mitochondria, since that would be reflected in an increased steady-state [Ca2+]e and none can be detected (Fig. 4), but instead the capacity of the mitochondria to accumulate Ca2+ is considerably decreased. Importantly this effect of acetoacetate is still observed in the presence of 1 μm cyclosporin and ADP (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Effect of acetoacetate upon mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation capacity. Rat liver mitochondria were suspended and infused with Ca2+ as in Fig. 1c with the inclusion of 1 μm CsA where shown. 2 mm lithium acetoacetate was added 2 min after the start of Ca2+ infusion (arrow) where shown (AA).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Relationship between Free and Total Matrix Ca2+ Concentrations during Ca2+ Infusion—Preincubation of isolated mitochondria with fluorescent Ca2+ indicators can allow sufficient loading to occur to monitor matrix free Ca2+ concentrations (15Moreno S.

In our hands it was difficult to achieve a reliable extent of loading with RLM and so subsequent experiments were performed with RBM.The low affinity fura analog fura2-FF (Kd = 5.5 μm) was found to load into the mitochondrial matrix as the acetoxymethyl ester and to be hydrolyzed sufficiently to enable changes in [Ca2+]m to be followed. Since mitochondrial autofluorescence, due primarily to NAD(P)H at the wavelengths employed, changes at the onset of the permeability transition (Fig. 2) in most experiments this was corrected for by parallel determinations in the absence of loaded dye.The hypothesis on which these studies were based was that changes in [Ca2+]m in the presence of excess phosphate would be largely buffered by the formation of calcium phosphate complexes. In order initially to assess the ability of the loaded fura2-FF to detect changes in [Ca2+]m therefore, mitochondria were extensively depleted of endogenous Pi by preincubation with ADP, glucose and hexokinase, as previously described (5Zoccarato F. Nicholls D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 127: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and acetate was added as permeant anion to prevent build up of a pH gradient. Since calcium acetate is highly soluble it would be predicted that [Ca2+]m would rise with Ca2+ load. Fig. 5 shows the increase in [Ca2+]m of RBM loaded with fura2-FF following four bolus additions of 10 μm Ca2+ to the cuvette. It is notable that the matrix free Ca2+ rose stepwise with each addition. In contrast, [Ca2+]e, determined in parallel with external CaG5N, partially recovered after each bolus addition as Ca2+ was accumulated into the matrix. Subsequent addition of 1 μm FCCP to depolarize the mitochondria resulted in an extrusion of Ca2+ from the matrix to the suspension medium, a decrease in [Ca2+]m and increase in [Ca2+]e, corresponding to Ca2+ efflux via the uniporter.Fig. 5Free [Ca2+]m changes upon accumulation of bolus Ca2+ additions and upon ΔΨm depolarization in the absence of Pi and presence of acetate. Fura2-FF was loaded into the matrix of RBM as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 0.1 mg of mitochondria were then depleted of endogenous Pi by incubation at 37 °C in 2 ml of 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm Hepes pH 7.2, 0.5 mm ADP, 5 mm glutamate, 5 mm malate, 1 mm glucose, and 0.75 units/ml hexokinase for 5 min. 1 μg/ml oligomycin and 2 mm sodium acetate was then added to stop ADP depletion and to act as a permeant anion respectively. Fura2-FF fluorescence was monitored as four bolus Ca2+ additions were made of 200 nmol/mg (10 μm). 1 μm FCCP was added followed by 1 mm Ca2+ and 5 mm EGTA to obtain maximum and minimum fluorescence respectively. a, the raw fluorescence traces ar"
https://openalex.org/W1983312081,"Survivin is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family that has been implicated in both apoptosis inhibition and cell cycle control. However, its inhibitory mechanism and subcellular localization remain controversial. In this report, we provided evidence for the first time that Survivin physically interacts with Smac/DIABLO both in vitro and in vivo. A point mutation (D71R) in the baculovirus IAP repeat motif and a C-terminal deletion mutant (Surv-BIR) of Survivin fail to bind to Smac/DIABLO and abrogate its ability to inhibit apoptosis. The N-terminal of mature Smac/DIABLO is absolutely required for Survivin·Smac complex formation. Subcellular distributions of Survivin and Smac/DIABLO showed that they co-localized within the cytosol during interphase. In addition, Survivin was found to be incapable of binding to caspase. We also identified that the co-presence of Smac/DIABLO and XIAP was required for Survivin to inhibit caspase cleavage in a cell-free system. In conclusion, our results provide the first evidence that the interaction between Smac/DIABLO and Survivin is an essential step underling the inhibition of apoptosis induced by Taxol. Survivin is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family that has been implicated in both apoptosis inhibition and cell cycle control. However, its inhibitory mechanism and subcellular localization remain controversial. In this report, we provided evidence for the first time that Survivin physically interacts with Smac/DIABLO both in vitro and in vivo. A point mutation (D71R) in the baculovirus IAP repeat motif and a C-terminal deletion mutant (Surv-BIR) of Survivin fail to bind to Smac/DIABLO and abrogate its ability to inhibit apoptosis.

Among the regulators of apoptosis, considerable interest has been focusing on the inhibitors of apoptosis protein (IAP) 1The abbreviations used are: IAP, inhibitor of apoptosis protein; BIR, baculovirus IAP repeat; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Ab, antibody; GFP, green fluorescence protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; cyto c, cytochrome c; TRAIL, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. 1The abbreviations used are: IAP, inhibitor of apoptosis protein; BIR, baculovirus IAP repeat; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Ab, antibody; GFP, green fluorescence protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; cyto c, cytochrome c; TRAIL, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. family, which were first identified as negative regulators in programmed cell death characterized by the presence of one to three copies of the baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) domain (1Crook N.E. Clem R.J. Miller L.K. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2168-2174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, anti-apoptotic function in physiological cell death has not been established for all IAPs, because some members in this family play essential roles in cell division, rather than merely acting as the regulators of apoptosis (2Uren A.G.

Survivin (16.5 KDa) is a special member of the inhibitor-of-apoptosis proteins (IAPs) family containing a single BIR and lacking a RING finger motif. It is mostly expressed in the vast majority of tumors or in the embryonic development, but not in normal adult tissues (3Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D.C. Nat.

Survivin is cell cycle-regulated and predominantly expressed in the G2/M phase (5Li F. Ambrosini G. Chu E.Y. Plescia J. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C. Nature. 1998; 396: 580-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar). The degradation of Survivin is believed to be through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (6Zhao J. Tenev T. Martins L.M. Downward J. Lemoine N.R. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4363-4371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence supports the idea that Survivin is a bifunctional protein that acts as a cell division regulator (7Fraser A.G. James C. Evan G.I. Hengartner M.O. Curr.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5315-5320PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that Survivin was able to bind to the effector caspase-3 and caspase-7 in vitro and proposed that Survivin may inhibit caspase activity in physiological cell death by the similar mechanism. However, comparison between the x-ray crystallographic structures of Survivin and that of the XIAP (BIR2)·caspase-3 complex fails to reveal any clues of how Survivin could directly suppress caspase-3 (17Riedl S.J.

Cell. 2001; 104: 769-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). However, whether Smac/DIABLO physically interacts with Survivin has yet to be fully characterized.In this report, we investigated the effect of interactions between Survivin and Smac/DIABLO on the apoptosis induced by Taxol (paclitaxel). We have demonstrated that Taxol is able to trigger apoptosis significantly in HeLa cell, resulting in the activation of cellular caspases-3, -7, and -9 and release of Smac/DIABLO and cytochrome c from the mitochondrial. Ectopic expression of Survivin was able to significantly block the Taxol-induced cell death. Our GST pull-down binding assay and immunoprecipitation demonstrate for the first time that Survivin directly interacted with Smac/DIABLO but not with caspases. We also found mutant Survivin with a single amino acid change at residue Asp-71 (D71R) or truncated Survivin lacking the C terminus (residues 1–97) failed to bind to Smac/DIABLO and abrogated its ability to inhibit apoptosis. On the contrary, these two Survivin mutants displayed some apoptotic effects. In addition, we have shown that wild type Survivin does not interact with Smac mutants M-Smac (a methionine was added to the begin of mature Smac) or Δ74Smac (residues 75–239). We examined subcellular distributions of Survivin and Smac/DIABLO within living cells at different stages of the cell cycle and found that Survivin and Smac are co-localized in the cytosol during interphase, and when cells enter into M phase Survivin acts as a chromosome passenger protein. In addition, by using the cell-free system, we were able to demonstrate that both Smac/DIABLO and XIAP are required in order for inhibition of caspase cleavage by Survivin. Combined, our data strongly support our proposed hypothetical mode for Survivin in the inhibition of apoptosis. During apoptosis Survivin binds to Smac, which is released from induced mitochondria. Therefore, by reducing Smac/DIABLO antagonism to IAPs, such as XIAP, the free XIAP directly interacts with caspases and cell death is blocked.MATERIALS AND METHODSOligonucleotides—The sequences of the oligonucleotides used in this study are listed as follows. P1, 5′-CGGGATCCGCATGGGTGCCCCGACGTTG-3′; P2, 5′-CGGTCGACCCATCCATGGCAGCCAGCTG-3′; P3, 5′-GCAAGCTTATGGCGGCTCTGAAGAGTTG-3′; P4, 5′-GCGGATCCTCCTCACGCAGGTAGGCCT-3′; P5, 5′-CGGTCGACGTTAATTCTTCAAACTGCTT-3′; P6, 5′-GCGATTAATATGGCGGTTCCTATTGCAC-3′; P7, 5′-CGGCGGCCGCATCCTCACGCAGGTAGGCCT-3′; P8, 5′-CGGGATCCGATTAATATGAGGAGAGCAGTGTCTTT-3′; P9, 5′-CGGGATCCTGATGGCGGTTCCTATTGCACAG-3′; P10, 5′-GGGAGCCAGATCGCGACCCCATAGAGGA-3′; P11, 5′-CTATGGGGTCGCGATCTGGCTCCCAGCC-3′; and P12, 5′-CGGGATCCTCAATCCATGGCAGCCAGCT-3′.Reagents and Antibodies—The following antibodies were used in this study: polyclonal antibodies Ab-caspase-7, Ab-caspase-3, Ab-survivin, and Ab-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); monoclonal antibodies: mAb-bcl2 (Oncogene, Manhasset, NY), mAb-GFP (MBL, Japan), mAb-cytochrome c (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN), mAb-caspase-9 (Immunotech, France), and mAb-Smac/DIABLO (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). Taxol used in our experiments is labeled as GCP grade. Restriction enzymes were mostly purchased from New England BioLabs. Medium compounds were obtained from Oxid. The majority of biochemical reagents were ordered from Sigma. Trypan blue was purchased from Invitrogen.Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1 × nonessential amino acid, 1 × minimal essential medium sodium pyruvate, 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY). Cultured cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Transfection of cells with various mammalian expression constructs by LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) was carried out according to the methods provided by the manufacturer's instructions.PCR-mediated Mutagenesis—To obtain the mutant survivin, we have employed the PCR-mediated mutagenesis method. Two pairs of primers, P1/P10 (complementing the regions from nucleotides 1 to 18 and nucleotides 196 to 224, respectively) and P11/P2 (complementing the regions from nucleotides 200 to 228 and nucleotides 408 to 426, respectively), were used to amplify two Survivin fragments. After gel purification, the resultant two overlapping PCR fragments were mixed with equal amounts. This mixture was incubated first at 94 °C for 4 min, followed by first PCR (PCR1) of 94 °C denaturing for 1 min, 56 °C annealing for 1 min, and 72 °C extension for 1 min. After 10 cycles, another 8-min extension was added to ensure the completion of all the extension at 72 °C. The PCR1 products were used as a template in a second PCR (PCR2), primed by oligonucleotides P10 and P11 to carry out another 20 cycles of PCR with the same PCR conditions used in PCR1. A prominent band with an expected size of 0.42 kb was visible on 1% agarose gel. A point mutation, GAC (Asp) to CGC (Arg), was further verified by DNA sequencing determination.Plasmids Construction—The full-length Survivin coding sequence (nucleotides 1–426) and its mutant variant with a point mutation at amino acid residue 71 (D71R) were cloned into BamHI/SalI sites of pGEX-5X-3 (Amersham Biosciences, UK), respectively, to generate recombinant expression vectors pGEX-5X-3/Survivin and pGEX-5X-3/Surv-D71R, and both fragments were inserted in-frame with the GST gene. The gene fragment (nucleotides 1–291), containing only the Survivin BIR domain (residues 1–97), was generated by the PCR method using primers P1 and P5 (see “Oligonucleotides”) and cloned into BamHI/SalI sites of pGEX-5X-3 to yield pGEX-5X-3/Surv-BIR. Gene fragments coding for wild type Survivin, for mutant Survivin (Surv-D71R) with a point mutation at amino acid residue 71, for the truncated Survivin (Surv-BIR) lacking its C-terminal and Smac/DIABLO were also cloned into pEGFP-C1 plasmid, respectively. In addition, the gene fragments (reacted by PCR for primer pairs P12/P1) was used to generated pTRE2/A-Surv (coding for antisense Survivin). The DNA fragment coding for mature Smac/DIABLO (residues 56–239) and DNA fragment coding for mutant Smac/DIABLO (Δ74Smac, residues75–239) were generated by PCR techniques using primer pairs P6/P7 and P8/P7, respectively. The resultant PCR products were digested with restriction enzymes VspI and NotI and cloned into NdeI/NotI sites of pET-22b (Novagen, Madison, WI) to generate pET-22b/Smac and pET-22b/Δ74Smac with an His6 tag fusion at its C terminus. A full-length Smac/DIABLO gene fragment (residues1–239) resulted from PCR amplification with primers P3 and P4 inserted into HindIII/BamHI sites of the mammalian expression vector pEGFP-N1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) to fuse to the EGFP gene, and the resultant recombinant plasmid was designated as pEGFP-N1/F-Smac. DNA fragments, coding for mutant Smac/DIABLO with an methionine residue added at the N terminus of mature Smac/DIABLO (designated as M-Smac) and for mutant Smac/DIABLO lacking 73 amino acid residues at its N terminus (designated as Δ73Smac), were reacted by PCR away from Smac/DIABLO cDNA using primer pairs P9/P4 and P8/P4, respectively, and inserted into the BamHI site of pEGFP-N1 in fusion with EGFP to generate plasmids pEGFP-N1/M-Smac and pEGFP-N1/Δ73Smac.Expression and Purification of Fusion Proteins—Overnight cultured Escherichia coli cells DH5α or BL21/DE3 containing the fusion plasmids were grown at a 1:100 dilution in an Amp-LB medium until the optical density reached A600 = 0.5. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 0.4 mm. Cells were induced for another 3 h before they were harvested and subjected to sonication for 10 shot pulses of 20 s each. The maximum protein release was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) by comparing the known concentration of bovine serum albumin (BSA). The GST fusion proteins were purified through the glutathione-Sepharose™ 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). The solubilized His6-Smac or His6-Δ74Smac fusion proteins were purified by incubating with chelating Sepharose™ Fast Flow beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The ultimate elution products were dialyzed with 1× PBS and were used for in vitro interaction assay.In Vitro Interaction Assay—An in vitro interaction assay was performed as described by Suzuki et al. (50Shin S. Sung B.J. Cho Y.S. Kim H.J. Ha N.C. Hwang J.I. Chung C.W. Jung Y.K. Oh B.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1117-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Taxol-stimulated HeLa cells (2 × 106) were lysed with the 200-μl lysis buffer as described above. Cell lysates or bacterially expressed and purified His6 tag proteins were incubated with GST or GST fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) for overnight at 4 °C and washed three times with 500 μl of 1× PBS. The bound proteins were eluted by elution buffer, and eluted products were subjected to SDS-PAGE for Western blot analysis or Coomassie Blue staining.Cell Death Assay—The ability of Survivin, Smac/DIABLO, or their mutants to affect cell viability was assayed by transfecting or HeLa cells (2 × 104 cells/well) in 24-well plates with 0.3 μg of mammalian expression vectors using LipofectAMINE 2000. Twenty hours after transfection, cells continued to be incubated with 100 nm Taxol for 36 h, and the viability of the cells was measured with the standard trypan blue exclusion method by counting blue dead cells. Data are expressed as percentages of control and are the means of three independent experiments.Western Blot Analysis—Cells were washed with 1× PBS and resuspended with 5 volumes of cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The cell lysate was incubated on ice for 30 min and was then centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C. The protein content of the supernatant was determined by using a BCA-200 protein assay kit (Pierce). Equal amounts of proteins (10–20 μg) were loaded onto the gel and separated by SDS-PAGE, and the resolved proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking with 5% nonfat milk in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for overnight at 4 °C, the blot was incubated with primary antibody for1hat room temperature. The membrane was then washed with TBST and probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. The membrane was washed three times in TBST and developed by ECL using the manufacturer's protocol. Digitonin fractionation of cells into membrane and cytosolic fractions used for detection of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO was performed as described by Ekert et al. (23Ekert P.G. Silke J. Hawkins C.J. Verhagen A.M. Vaux D.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed in a Triton X-100-based lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture) for 1 h, and the nuclear and cellular debris was cleared by centrifugation. Then the cytosolic lysis was incubated with Smac monoclonal antibody bound to Protein A/G-Sepharose. After a 4-h incubation at 4 °C, the immunoprecipitates were washed five times in lysis buffer, and proteins were recovered by boiling the beads in SDS sample buffer and analyzed using a Western blot.Immunofluorescence Confocal Microscopy—HeLa cells were grown in six-well chamber slides, and 24 h later, cells were either left untreated or exposed to 100 nm Taxol for another 24-h incubation before 100 nm MitoTracker Red was added and treated for 60 min at 37 °C. The cells were then washed with PBS, fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and blocked for 1 h in 3% BSA in PBS at 4 °C. Cells were incubated with anti-Smac (1:400 in 3% BSA) or anti-cyto c antibody (1:400 in 3% BSA) for 1 h at room temperature. The primary antibody was recognized by secondary FITC-conjugated antibody. Finally, the stained cells were analyzed with a laser scanning confocal microscopy system (Fluoview, Olympus).RESULTSSmac/DIABLO Is Released from the Mitochondria Accompanied with Cytochrome c upon Induction of Apoptosis by Taxol— Taxol is a natural product with potent anti-tumor activity and has been approved for the treatment of breast, ovarian, and lung cancers (25Marone M. D'Andrilli G. Das N. Ferlini C. Chatterjee S. Scambia G. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 270: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 30Rowinsky E.K. Cazenave L.A. Donehower R.C. J. Natl. Cancer.

We incubated HeLa cells with Taxol at a concentration of 100 nm, which is known to induce apoptosis in a number of different cell types. After 24-h incubation, the clear morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis were observed. Taxol-treated cells became rounded and detached from the substratum of the flask, followed by cellular shrinkage and membrane blebbing (data not shown). Caspase activation was believed to be the key factor during apoptosis. To evaluate which of the caspases is activated during the process of Taxol-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells, we analyzed the cleavage pattern of caspase-9, caspase-7, and caspase-3 by Western analysis methods. The results, shown in Fig. 1A, indicate that treatment with this drug results in the activation of caspase-9, caspase-7, and caspase-3 as evidenced by the appearance of caspase-active forms. One apoptotic signaling pathway leading into caspase activation involves the translocation of cytochrome c into the cytosol from the mitochondrial intermembrane space (33Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4435) Google Scholar). To further investigate whether the mitochondria are involved in this event, Taxol-treated HeLa cells were first lysed and divided into membrane pellet and cytosolic fraction. The pellet was then treated with 0.5% bile acid deoxycholate and separated by centrifugation into a soluble and membrane fraction. Cytosolic proteins and membrane proteins solubilized by the deoxycholate treatment were subjected to Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1B (panel a), an increasing amount of cytochrome c was detected in the cytosolic fractions, whereas a decreasing amount of cytochrome c remained in the mitochondrial membrane, and after 48 h, the majority of cytochrome c was detected in the cytosolic fractions. We also observed that Smac/DIABLO was predominantly present within the membrane fractions prior to treatment with Taxol, and by 48 h post-treatment, there was a significant loss of Smac/DIABLO from the membrane fractions and a concomitant increase of Smac/DIABLO in the cytosolic fractions (Fig. 1B, panel a). In addition, to further elucidate the behavior of Smac/DIABLO or cyto c during Taxol-induced apoptosis, we examined its subcellular localization in both untreated cells and treated cells by immunostaining and confocal microscopy (Fig. 1B, panel b). HeLa cells were stained with MitoTracker Red to define the location of mitochondria and with anti-Smac or anti-cyto c antibody plus an FITC-conjugated secondary antibody. In uninduced HeLa cells, the localization of FITC and MitoTracker Red staining gave rise to the yellow color indicating that both Smac/DIABLO and cyto c were localized within the mitochondria. However, after induction with Taxol for 24 h, both Smac/DIABLO and cyto c were partially released into cytoplasm from mitochondria evidenced by their changed localization pattern different from MitoTracker Red staining. Thus we have demonstrated that Taxol treatment results in the release of cyto c and Smac/DIABLO, suggesting that the mitochondria pathway is involved.Ectopic Overexpression of Smac/DIABLO Sensitizes HeLa Cells to Taxol-induced Apoptosis—Smac/DIABLO is capable of promoting apoptosis induced by various apoptotic stimuli, including TRAIL, UV irradiation, and etoposide (22Chauhan D.

We have demonstrated that treatment of Taxol could result in the release of Smac/DIABLO from mitochondria (Fig. 1B); it is therefore rational to propose that released cytosolic Smac/DIABLO may increase the susceptibility of HeLa cells to Taxol induction. To test this hypothesis, we transiently transfected HeLa cells with plasmids pEGFP-N1/F-Smac, pEGFP-N1/M-Smac, pEGFP-N1/Δ73Smac, and pEGFP-N1 separately (Fig. 2A). After 24 h of transfection, cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-GFP antibody. Fig. 2B shows that full-length Smac (F-Smac) and its deleted mutants (M-Smac and Δ73Smac) were overexpressed in the transfected cells but not in the control cells transfected with vector. Mature Smac resulted from F-Smac cleavage from mitochondria upon Taxol induction was also examined by Western blot (Fig. 2B, lane 3). We then determined whether overexpressed Smac/DIABLO promoted apoptosis induced by Taxol. 20 h after transfection, cells were treated with 100 nm Taxol and incubated for another 36 h then collected and subjected to trypan blue staining. As shown in Fig. 2C, elevated expression of full-length Smac, which was cleaved after mitochondria import into the mature Smac/DIABLO, significantly increased Taxol-induced apoptosis, whereas two Smac-deleted mutants, M-Smac and Δ73Smac, which were reported to be unable to bind to XIAP (26Wu G.

https://openalex.org/W2022385815,"Superoxide production by phagocytes involves activation of a multi-component NADPH oxidase. Recently, several homologues of the catalytic component of the phagocyte oxidase, gp91phox, were identified in various tissues. Here we describe two proteins, p41 and p51, with significant homology to two cytosolic components of the phagocytic oxidase, p47phox and p67phox. Like p47phox, p41 contains an amino-terminal Phox homology domain, two SH3 domains, and a conserved carboxyl-terminal, proline-rich motif. Similarly, p51 is homologous to p67phox, containing four amino-terminal tetratrico-peptide repeats, a conserved “activation domain” motif, a PB1 domain, and a carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain. The highest levels of p41 transcript are detected in the colon and in other gastrointestinal tissues that express Nox1, the predominant gp91phox homologue in these tissues. In contrast, the p51 transcript showed a more widespread expression pattern, suggesting that it may support other tissue-specific oxidases. Mouse colon in situ hybridization detected both transcripts in the epithelial cells of colon crypts. Heterologous co-expression of p41 and p51 significantly enhances the superoxide-generating activity of Nox1-expressing cells; thus, p41 and p51 appear to be novel regulators of Nox1. These proteins also support the activity of gp91phox, albeit at much lower levels than the cytosolic phox counterparts.

Our results suggest colon epithelial cells contain a multi-component NAD(P)H oxidase with a molecular architecture similar to the phagocytic oxidase. Neutrophils and other circulating phagocytic cells are recognized for their unique capacity for robust reactive oxidant generation. This activity is attributed to a phagocyte-specific NADPH oxidase (phox), which serves as an effective microbicidal system (1Leto T.L. Gallin J.I. Snyderman R. Inflammation Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia1999: 769-787Google Scholar). Patients with deficient phox activity suffer from chronic granulomatous disease, an inherited disease characterized by enhanced susceptibility to microbial infections due to the absence of or defects in any one of several essential phagocyte oxidase components (1Leto T.L. Gallin J.I. Snyderman R. Inflammation Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia1999: 769-787Google Scholar, 2Segal B.H. Leto T.L. Gallin J.I. Malech H.L. Holland S.M. Medicine. 2000; 79: 170-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). The phox system is subject to tight regulation, as it is dormant in resting cells and becomes activated in response to infectious or inflammatory stimuli. This involves the coordinated translocation of several phosphorylated cytosolic phox factors, as well as the activation of the small GTPase Rac2, which assemble in a membrane-bound complex with flavocytochrome b558 (1Leto T.L. Gallin J.I. Snyderman R. Inflammation Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia1999: 769-787Google Scholar). Recently, several oxidases have been identified in other tissues, based on their homology to the catalytic core component of the flavocytochrome, gp91phox (3Suh Y.A. Arnold R.S. Lassegue B. Shi J.

These novel enzymes are proposed to serve a variety of functions, including oxygen sensing, hormone biosynthesis, and signal transduction affecting vasoregulation, cellular proliferation, senescence, and apoptosis; however, little is known about the factors that influence the oxidative output of these related Nox family oxidases. The thyroid and lymphoid oxidases contain multiple calcium-binding EF-hands, consistent with their apparent activation by calcium signals (5Dupuy C. Ohayon R. Valent A. Noel-Hudson M.S. Deme D.

The renal oxidase, Nox4 or Renox, produces measurable amounts of superoxide and induces cellular senescence when heterologously expressed in transfected NIH-3T3 cells, suggesting that this enzyme may be constitutively active, consistent with its proposed role in oxygen sensing (4Geiszt M.

In contrast, the colon-specific oxidase, Nox1, appears to be a low-activity enzyme when ectopically expressed (3Suh Y.A. Arnold R.S. Lassegue B. Shi J. Xu X. Sorescu D. Chung A.B. Griendling K.K. Lambeth J.D. Nature (Lond.). 1999; 401: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). Nox1 exhibits functional similarities to the phagocyte oxidase, as it restores differentiation- and activation-dependent superoxide production when transduced into gp91phox-deficient myeloid cell models, indicative of a capacity to cross talk with other phox components. 1Geiszt, M., Lekstrom, K., Brenner, S., Hewitt, S. M., Dana, R., Malech, H. L. and Leto, T. L. (2003) J. Immunol., in press.1Geiszt, M., Lekstrom, K., Brenner, S., Hewitt, S. M., Dana, R., Malech, H. L. and Leto, T. L. (2003) J. Immunol., in press. Furthermore, co-expression of two cytosolic phox components, p47phox and p67phox, augments Nox1 activity in an activation-dependent manner. These observations demonstrate a significant level of functional homology (cofactor-dependence and regulated superoxide production) between Nox1 and its closest relative, gp91phox, raising the interesting possibility that Nox1 may function as a multi-component, phox-like oxidase in differentiated colon cells. Based on these findings, we searched for candidate phox-like proteins as potential functional partners of Nox1. Here we identify two novel proteins that have significant structural homology to p47phox and p67phox and that are capable of supporting Nox1 activity. Sequence Analysis—We performed initial data base searches in the non-redundant peptide sequence data base of GenBankTM using the protein sequences of p47phox and p67phox as query sequences. The following IMAGE clones were identified and obtained from Research Genetics: the human p41 cDNA (4661469), the mouse p41 cDNA (6399072), the mouse p51 cDNA (4988389), and the human p51 cDNA (5197877). The full coding sequence for human p51 cDNA was amplified from human kidney cDNA using Advantage 2 polymerase (Clontech) and primers designed from IMAGE clone 5197877 (5′ primer: ATGGCCTCTCTGGGGGACCT; 3′ primer: GCATCATTAGGGCTGATCTCCCTG). We conducted additional nucleotide BLAST searches in the data base of expressed sequence tags (dbEST) to identify other homologous EST entries, verifying the results of direct sequence analysis. Northern Blot and in Situ Hybridization—For the human p41 mRNA detection, human multiple-tissue (2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA) and gastrointestinal tissue (1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA) Northern blot membranes (Clontech) were probed at 65 °C with a randomly radiolabeled p41 cDNA fragment (Amersham Biosciences), following standard hybridization methods. For detection of the mouse p51 mRNA, mouse multiple tissue Northern blot membranes containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA/lane (Clontech) were hybridized with a randomly radiolabeled p51 cDNA fragment. For the analysis of Nox1-transfected fibroblasts, total RNA was prepared from 107 cells (15 μg), electrophoretically separated on a 1% agarose formaldehyde gel, and transferred to nylon membrane. Membranes were probed at 55 °C with a randomly radiolabeled human Nox1 cDNA fragment (Amersham Biosciences) by standard hybridization protocols. For in situ hybridization on mouse colon sections, mouse p41 and p51 cDNAs were used as templates. Single-stranded, [35S]UTP-labeled RNA transcripts (sense or antisense riboprobes) were synthesized by T3, T7, or SP6 RNA polymerases, using linearized vector templates. The probing of mouse colon tissue was performed according to the protocol described at intramural.nimh.nih.gov/lcmr/snge/Protocols/ISHH/ISHH.html. Exposed silver grains from autoradiography were visualized with dark-field optics and were photographed using a red filter to contrast with superimposed Giemsa-stained, bright-field images of the same sections. Cell Culture and Cell Transfection and Transduction—For expression studies, the complete coding sequence of human Nox1, p41, and p51 were subcloned into pcDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen). NIH-3T3 fibroblasts and Caco2 adenocarcinoma cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and sodium pyruvate (1 mm). For establishment of Nox1-expressing NIH-3T3 cell line, fibroblasts were transfected at 60–70% confluence, with pcDNA3.1-Nox1 or the empty pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) using the Geneporter (Gene Therapy Systems) transfection reagent (3 μg plasmid DNA and 20 μl of Geneporter/300,000–500,000 cells). Cells were selected with G418 (2 mg/ml) 48 h post-transfection, and individual resistant colonies were isolated 7 days later. In transient expression experiments, Caco2 cells and Nox1-NIH-3T3 fibroblasts were transfected with either pcDNA3.1-p41, pcDNA3.1-p51, or the combination of the two plasmids using the Geneporter transfection reagent. K562 cells expressing gp91phox were established using MFG-S-gp91phox retrovirus, as described (9Li F. Linton G.F. Sekhsaria S. Whiting-Theobald N. Katkin J.P. Gallin J.I. Malech H.L. Blood. 1994; 84: 53-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and were then transiently transfected with the human pcDNA3.1-p41 and pcDNA3.1-p51 plasmids (30 μg DNA/10 million cells) by electroporation (10Leto T.L. Adams A.G. de Mendez I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10650-10654Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Superoxide production by transfected cells was analyzed 24–66 h after transfection. In control experiments, mock transfections using Geneporter alone or control (empty) vector had no significant effect on oxidant release by these cells. Measurement of Superoxide Production—Superoxide production by Caco2, NIH-3T3, and K562 cells was measured by chemiluminescence using DIOGENES (National Diagnostics), a superoxide-specific chemiluminescence reagent. Adherent cells were trypsinized and washed twice in 1× Hank's balanced solution with Ca2+ and Mg2+. Measurements were performed in 96-well microtiter chemiluminescence plates (5 × 105 cells/well) at 37 °C over a time course of 1 h using a Luminoskan luminometer (Labsystems). The net integrated light units recorded from these reactions (adjusted to account for the low luminescence observed in mock-transfected cells) were shown to be sensitive to superoxide dismutase. Using the BLAST search algorithm, we identified a novel protein sequence in the non-redundant protein data base of GenBankTM deposited by the Human Genome Project that showed significant homology to p47phox (BC015917). Based on its predicted sequence, we named this protein p41 (calculated molecular mass of 41 kDa). A subsequent BLAST search of the Human Genome Data base, using the p41 nucleotide sequence as a query, indicated that the corresponding gene is located on chromosome 16 (16p13.3). The corresponding IMAGE clone (4661469) was obtained and sequenced; the predicted open reading frame encodes a 370-amino acid protein with 27% sequence identity and 46% sequence similarity to human p47phox (Fig. 1A). A full coding murine sequence homologous to the human cDNA was identified by a Blast search in the data base of expressed sequence tags (BQ935073); the predicted mouse protein has 66% identity with the human p41nox sequence. Although the overall homology between p47phox and p41 is relatively low, p41 shares remarkable structural similarities with its phagocytic counterpart (Fig. 1B). It contains an amino-terminal PX-domain, followed by two tandem SH3-domains. The protein also has a carboxyl-terminal proline-rich sequence motif (320-PPPTVPTRPSP-332) that could serve as a SH3 domain-binding sequence. The homologous proline-rich motif near the carboxyl terminus of p47phox was shown to interact with the carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain of p67phox (10Leto T.L. Adams A.G. de Mendez I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10650-10654Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 11Sumimoto H. Kage Y. Nunoi H. Sasaki H. Nose T. Fukumaki Y. Ohno M. Minakami S. Takeshige K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Aside from these remarkable similarities, there are several notable differences between these proteins. For example, p47phox contains several serine residues within a polybasic, carboxyl-terminal region (“auto-inhibitory” domain) that were identified as phosphorylation sites that regulate assembly of the phagocytic NAD(P)H oxidase complex (12El Benna J. Faust R.P. Johnson J.L. Babior B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6374-6378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Most of these serine residues and their flanking sequences are absent in p41. The PX domain of p47phox contains a PXXP motif at position 73–76 that is conserved in several other PX domain sequences and was proposed to participate in an intra-molecular interaction with the carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain of p47phox (13Hiroaki H. Ago T. Ito T. Sumimoto H. Kohda D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 6: 526-530Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The PXXP sequence motif is absent in the p41 PX domain. In Northern blotting experiments, p41 mRNA was detected as a 1.6-kb signal in the colon and the small intestine (Fig. 2A). In other blotting experiments that probed a human gastrointestinal mRNA panel, the p41 transcript was detected in the ileocecal region, the cecum, and the ascending, transverse, and descending colon. When this RNA panel was re-probed with a Nox1-specific probe, a very similar expression pattern was observed (Fig. 2B). Previous experiments in our laboratory indicated that Nox1 is expressed in the epithelial cells of the mouse colon.1In situ hybridization experiments with fixed mouse colon sections revealed that p41 mRNA is also abundant within epithelial cells of the colon crypts (Fig. 2C). To explore the possible interaction between Nox1 and p41, we expressed p41 in a K562 erythroleukemia cell line that was previously transduced for Nox1 expression. The co-expression of p41 and Nox1 did not result in any detectable change in superoxide production in these cells. In other experiments, we co-expressed p41, p67phox, and Nox1 in K562 cells and observed a small detectable increase in superoxide output (data not shown). The relatively low stimulatory effect of p41 on the superoxide-producing activity of Nox1 prompted us to search for proteins homologous to p67phox that could interact with p41. Using the p67phox protein sequence as a query sequence to screen the non-redundant peptide sequence data base in GenbankTM, we identified a sequence homologous to the carboxyl-terminal portion of p67phox that was described as a human colon tumor-specific antigen (NY-CO-31), recognized by autologous antibodies in colon cancer patients (14Scanlan M.J. Chen Y.T. Williamson B. Gure A.O. Stockert E. Gordan J.D. Tureci O. Sahin U. Pfreundschuh M. Old L.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 76: 652-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Subsequent homology searches with the NY-CO-31 sequence identified larger mouse (BG967340, IMAGE 4988389) and human EST clones (BI753839, IMAGE 5197877) with more extended homology with p67phox. The mouse EST clone was obtained and sequenced. The open reading frame translates into a 444-amino acid protein with 27% identity and 40% similarity to p67phox (Fig. 3A). The human EST appears to contain an intronic sequence that was not observed in any other deposited sequence in dbEST. The open reading frame of the human sequence was amplified from kidney cDNA using primers derived from IMAGE clone 5197877. This cDNA matches other EST sequences and translates into a 476-amino acid protein with 38% sequence identity and 56% sequence similarity to human p67phox. The mouse and human p51 protein sequences are only 60% identical. We named this protein p51, based on the calculated molecular mass of the human p67phox homologue. These proteins exhibit the most remarkable structural conservation with domains in p67phox shown to be involved in interactions with other phox components (Fig. 3); this includes four amino-terminal tetratrico-peptide repeats (TPR) 2The abbreviations used are: TPR, tetratrico-peptide repeats; PMS, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. that interact with Rac, a carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain that interacts with p47phox, and a sequence homologous to the activation domain motif of p67phox (residues 199–210) that participates in activation of the phox system (15Han C.H. Freeman J.L. Lee T. Motalebi S.A. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16663-16668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Both the human and murine proteins lack sequences homologous to the central SH3 domain of p67phox. Murine p51 lacks additional flanking sequences within central regions of human p51; its PB1 domain also appears to be less conserved, because its homology to the PB1 domain of p67phox was not detected in BLAST searches. The expression pattern of p51 was first examined by Northern blotting of several mouse tissues. Compared with the expression pattern of p41, the p51 mRNA was more widely detected in various tissues. The p51 transcript was not only detected in mouse colon, uterus, prostate, small intestine, and stomach, tissues where Nox1 expression has been documented (3Suh Y.A. Arnold R.S. Lassegue B. Shi J. Xu X. Sorescu D. Chung A.B. Griendling K.K. Lambeth J.D. Nature (Lond.). 1999; 401: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar, 16Teshima S. Kutsumi H. Kawahara T. Kishi K. Rokutan K. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G1169-G1176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but also in lung, thyroid, and salivary glands (Fig. 4A). In situ hybridization experiments on mouse colon sections revealed an expression pattern that is indistinguishable from that of p41, suggesting that the two proteins might act together with Nox1 in colon epithelial cells (Fig. 4B). We also detected the p51 mRNA in the human colon by Northern blot and reverse transcription-PCR, although kidney and liver were also positive for the human p51 mRNA (data not shown). Interestingly, although the human colon expresses high levels of Nox1 and p41 mRNA, the expression level of p51 was comparatively low, suggesting that this gene product may be a limiting factor in activation of the colon oxidase. To study their possible interactions with Nox1, we transfected p41 and p51 in Caco2 colon epithelial adenocarcinoma cells, which express the endogenous Nox1 mRNA (3Suh Y.A. Arnold R.S. Lassegue B. Shi J. Xu X. Sorescu D. Chung A.B. Griendling K.K. Lambeth J.D. Nature (Lond.). 1999; 401: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar).1 As shown in Fig. 5A, neither p41 nor p51 stimulate significant superoxide production when expressed alone; however, we observed a significant increase in superoxide production when both proteins were present in these Nox1-expressing cells. The overall yield of superoxide in these reconstituted cells was not dependent on PMA stimulation. In other experiments, we co-transfected p41 and p51 into NIH-3T3 fibroblasts that were previously transfected with the human Nox1 cDNA (Fig. 5B). The co-expression of p41 and p51 resulted in significantly enhanced superoxide production, similar to that observed in Caco2 cells, although the activity reconstituted in NIH-3T3 cells was remarkably dependent on PMA stimulation. These experiments confirmed that p41 and p51 interact with Nox1 to form a functional NAD(P)H oxidase complex. We also co-expressed p41 and p51 in mixed pairs with their phagocytic counterparts, p47phox and p67phox, to determine whether these homologous proteins could also support Nox1 activity. Significantly lower levels of oxidase activity were reconstituted when the colon isoforms were co-expressed in combination with the phox proteins, or when both cytosolic phox proteins were expressed in place of p41 and p51 (Fig. 5B). These reconstitution experiments, together with the observed expression patterns, clearly indicate that p41 and p51 are natural functional partners of Nox1 in colon epithelial cells that together form an active colon oxidase. Reciprocal experiments were also conducted to examine whether p41 and p51 could support the activity of gp91phox. For this purpose, p41 and p51 or their phagocytic counterparts were co-transfected in K562 cells that were previously transduced for high gp91phox expression. Fig. 5C shows that co-expression of p47phox and p67phox restored comparatively higher levels of oxidase activity in these cells. In contrast, the activities supported by p41 and p51 together or as mixed pairs with the phox isoforms were significantly lower (<1%) than the “complete” phox system, again indicative of a considerable functional divergence between the human colon and phagocytic oxidase systems. In all cases the reconstituted activity of gp91phox in these cells was dependent on PMA stimulation. Reactive oxygen species production by phagocytic cells has a well established role in the arsenal of antimicrobial systems of the innate immune system. The multi-component nature of the phox system offers several features for the tight regulation of toxic oxidant production by phagocytes, which is considered essential for the targeted killing of invading microbes. In the past two years, several new homologues of gp91phox, the catalytic core of the phagocytic oxidase, have been described due in part to the rapid growth of nucleic acid sequence databases (3Suh Y.A.

These homologues, now known as members of the Nox/Duox family of NAD(P)H oxidases, all contain highly conserved structural elements considered necessary for the transport of electrons from the cytosol, through the membrane, to molecular oxygen. These include carboxyl-terminal sequence motifs involved in binding of flavin and NAD(P)H and four conserved histidines that co-ordinate two heme adducts within transmembrane domains (17Biberstine-Kinkade K.J.

The identification of a novel source of reactive oxygen species in the colon epithelium is an important finding, as reactive oxygen species production in this organ could have roles in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease and colon cancer. Nox1 causes increased cell proliferation when ectopically expressed in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, and these Nox1-transfected cells induce tumor formation in nude mice (3Suh Y.A. Arnold R.S. Lassegue B.

The study suggested that Nox1 is a constitutively active enzyme with low-level superoxide output. In contrast, we recently obtained evidence that Nox1 could interact with cytosolic components of the phagocytic oxidase when expressed in gp91phox-deficient PLB-985 cells and K562 cells. Thus, the reconstituted Nox1 can function as a regulated and activated oxidase complex.1 The functional interactions between Nox1, p47phox, and p67phox suggest close similarities between the phagocyte and colon enzymes. This prompted us to search for colon-specific homologues of p47phox and p67phox. In this report, we identified and characterized two proteins, p41 and p51, that have considerable homology to the p47phox and p67phox cytosolic components of the phagocytic oxidase and that appear to support the activity of Nox1. While this manuscript was in preparation, Banfi et al. (19Banfi B. Clark R.A. Steger K. Krause K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3510-3513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) also described the murine homologues of these proteins, which were designated as NOXO1 (p41) and NOXA1 (p51) for Nox organizer 1 and Nox activator 1, respectively. Although p41 exhibits significant structural similarity to p47phox in terms of size and conserved domain structure, we noted several important differences between the two proteins that could have important functional consequences. The absence of multiple, conserved serine residues in the carboxyl terminus of p41 suggests that direct, protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation of this protein does not play a role in the regulation of p41 function. Several reports suggest that p47phox exists in an inhibited state under resting conditions (10Leto T.L. Adams A.G. de Mendez I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10650-10654Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 11Sumimoto H. Kage Y. Nunoi H. Sasaki H. Nose T. Fukumaki Y. Ohno M. Minakami S. Takeshige K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It has been proposed that phosphorylation on the carboxyl-terminal serine residues during phagocyte stimulation releases these intramolecular interactions within p47phox and enables SH3 domain interactions with the proline-rich carboxyl terminus of p22phox (10Leto T.L. Adams A.G. de Mendez I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10650-10654Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 11Sumimoto H. Kage Y. Nunoi H. Sasaki H. Nose T. Fukumaki Y. Ohno M. Minakami S. Takeshige K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Two structural differences between p47phox and p41 suggest that an auto-inhibited conformation involving intramolecular SH3 domain contacts is not assumed by p41: (i) the PXXP motif present in the PX domain of several proteins is absent in p41, and (ii) most of the phosphorylated serine residues in the carboxyl-terminal portion, as well as flanking sequences within the polybasic, auto-inhibitory domain of p47phox (residues 299–340) are absent. Interestingly, sequence homologous to p47phox residues 318–329 (RLSQDAYRRNRSV), shown to be involved in interactions with p67phox and the flavocytochrome b (21De Leo F.R. Ulman K.V. Davis A.R.

These observations suggest that p41 adopts an “open” conformation under resting conditions and that regulation of p41 is achieved by other mechanisms. When expressed together with p67phox in Nox1-transfected cells, we observed only a moderate stimulatory effect of p41 on superoxide production. This low efficiency observed with proteins combined from the two oxidase systems prompted us to search the nucleic acid databases for colon-specific homologues of p67phox. Using the deposited sequence information about a cloned tumor antigen, we were able to identify both mouse and human homologues of p67phox. Similar to p67phox, p51 contains four amino-terminal TPR repeats and a carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain preceded by a PB1 domain. Both p67phox homologues also contain a short stretch of conserved amino acids immediately following the TPR repeats, which is homologous to the activation domain in p67phox (15Han C.H. Freeman J.L.

For example, the carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain has been shown to interact with the carboxyl-terminal proline-rich motif of p47phox. Because the structural elements necessary for this interaction are well conserved in p51 and p41, it is likely that a similar interaction occurs between these proteins and that the two exist in a complex. Furthermore, the presence of amino-terminal TPR motifs in p51 suggests that this protein interacts with Rac, as in p67phox (26Koga H. Terasawa H. Nunoi H. Takeshige K. Inagaki F. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25051-25060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 27Lapouge K. Smith S.J. Walker P.A. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Rittinger K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 899-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The presence of PB1 domains in human and mouse p51 suggests that proteins containing the PC motif might be partners of p51. The mouse p51 sequence PB1 domain, however, is less conserved and human p51 lacks sequences homologous to the p67phox lysine residue 355 that was shown to be critical for its interaction with the PC motif of p40phox, suggesting that p40phox is not a regulator of the colon oxidase. Finally, we observed significant structural differences in the C-terminal sequences of human and mouse p51 and p67phox. Neither p51 sequence is entirely hydrophobic; an association of these tail sequences with the membrane, as suggested recently (19Banfi B. Clark R.A. Steger K. Krause K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3510-3513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), seems unlikely. Both the expression patterns and our transfection studies with the human p41 and p51 suggest that these proteins are uniquely adapted to function in concert with Nox1 in colon epithelial cells. These proteins together reconstituted high levels of “constitutive” (i.e. PMA-independent) activity in Caco2 colon epithelial cells, as was recently demonstrated when the murine forms were heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells (19Banfi B. Clark R.A. Steger K. Krause K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3510-3513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). In contrast to the murine proteins, however, we demonstrated in some settings (i.e. Nox1-expressing NIH-3T3 cells or gp91phox-expressing cells) that the activity supported by the human proteins is significantly enhanced by PMA stimulation. Future work should explore whether these differences in regulation reflect evolutionary differences in these proteins and whether the environment of differentiated colon epithelial cells renders this oxidase constitutively active. Our studies exploring the effects of co-expression of colon and phagocytic components demonstrated that the human proteins are less capable of functioning as mixed Nox/phox complexes than the murine proteins (19Banfi B. Clark R.A. Steger K. Krause K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3510-3513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Because the murine proteins were characterized in a different host system, it is possible that differences in host cell factors may account, in part, for this difference. It is nonetheless tempting to speculate that the significant structural differences in these proteins across species can account for this apparent functional divergence between the phox and Nox1 systems in man. Although both p41 and p51 are expressed in mouse and human colon, we also detected p51 mRNA in several other tissues and suspect that it might support the activity of other oxidases. In this regard, it is particularly intriguing that p51 is expressed in the thyroid gland, the salivary gland, and the lung, where Duox isoforms are present (5Dupuy C. Ohayon R. Valent A.

The close homology, as well as the functional similarities in the regulation of Nox1 and gp91phox activities by homologous components, raises the possibility that the colon oxidase has similar host defense functions as the phagocytic system. It is well known that the colon is inhabited by a plethora of microorganisms and must, therefore, maintain an effective epithelial barrier against invasion of the host. This proposed role of the colon oxidase in mucosal defense against these microorganisms is an exciting possibility that will require further investigation."

In this study we focused on the initial fate of E-cadherin when it predominantly exists free on the cell surface prior to adhesive binding or incorporation into junctions. Surface-labeling techniques were used to define the endocytic itinerary of E-cadherin in MCF-7 cells and in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing human E-cadherin. We found that in this experimental system E-cadherin entered a transferrin-negative compartment before transport to the early endosomal compartment, where it merged with classical clathrin-mediated uptake pathways. E-cadherin endocytosis was inhibited by mutant dynamin, but not by an Eps15 mutant that effectively blocked transferrin internalization. Furthermore, sustained signaling by the ARF6 GTPase appeared to trap endocytosed E-cadherin in large peripheral structures. We conclude that in isolated cells unbound E-cadherin on the cell surface is predominantly endocytosed by a clathrin-independent pathway resembling macropinocytotic internalization, which then fuses with the early endosomal system. Taken with earlier reports, this suggests the possibility that multiple pathways exist for E-cadherin entry into cells that are likely to reflect cell context and regulation.

Taken with earlier reports, this suggests the possibility that multiple pathways exist for E-cadherin entry into cells that are likely to reflect cell context and regulation. Cadherin cell adhesion molecules support cell-cell adhesion and recognition in most tissues of the body (1Takeichi M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar, 2Marrs J.A. Nelson W.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1996; 165: 159-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Gumbiner B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 119-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). E-cadherin is the predominant cadherin found in epithelia, where it localizes to specialized adherens junctions between cells, as well as being found more generally in the lateral plasma membrane where cells come into contact with one another. Like other classical cadherins, E-cadherin is a key determinant of tissue organization both during development and in post-embryonic life (2Marrs J.A. Nelson W.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1996; 165: 159-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of note, E-cadherin contributes to morphogenetic patterning in the early embryo and during organogenesis, where it participates in dynamic adhesive contacts that may be different from those found in classical adherens junctions (4Huber O. Bierkamp C. Kemler R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 5Tepass U. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 540-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 6Tepass U. Troung K. Godt D. Ikura M. Peifer M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Conversely, loss of E-cadherin function is an important step in epithelial tumor progression to invasiveness and metastasis (8Yap A.S. Cancer Invest. 1998; 16: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In many instances, the morphogenetic influence of E-cadherin and other classical cadherins is critically influenced by changes in the cell surface expression of these molecules. For example, quantitative as well as qualitative changes in cadherin expression determine cell sorting both in cell culture models (9Steinberg M.S. Takeichi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 206-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar) as well as in the early embryo (10Godt D. Tepass U. Nature. 1998; 395: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Indeed, both quantitative and qualitative changes in cadherin expression are subject to developmental regulation (5Tepass U. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 540-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 6Tepass U. Troung K. Godt D. Ikura M. Peifer M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of E-cadherin, by either transcriptional silencing or protein degradation, also occurs during epithelial-mesenchymal transitions during organogenesis and tumorigenesis (11Thiery J.-P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 442-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (5433) Google Scholar). However, many very dynamic morphogenetic events entail regulated changes in cadherin activity that are not attributable to alterations in either the overall level of protein expression, or to changes in the repertoire of cadherins expressed at the cell surface. This is exemplified by cell-upon-cell locomotion in the Drosophila ovary (7Geisbrecht E.R. Montell D.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and in Xenopus embryos (12Brieher W.M. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), where cadherin adhesions provide the traction for cells to move upon one another, but must also be regulated and remodeled to allow translocation to occur. Post-Golgi trafficking of E-cadherin has recently emerged as an alternative mechanism to support dynamic changes in cadherin activity. We found that polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cell monolayers display some internalization of cell surface E-cadherin (13Le T.L. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). This entered an early endosomal compartment and was then recycled back to the cell surface relatively quickly (time scale of 15–30 min) without undergoing degradation. Importantly, this post-Golgi trafficking pathway contributed to the remodeling of cell-cell contacts: blocking the recycling of internalized E-cadherin back to the cell surface significantly perturbed the ability of cells to re-establish cadherin-based cell-cell contacts that had been disrupted by manipulation of extracellular calcium. We postulated that recycling of E-cadherin might provide a mechanism for cadherinbased contacts to be rapidly remodeled during morphogenesis and tissue reorganization. Indeed, inhibition of dynamin activity blocked morphogenesis in the early Xenopus embryo, closely correlated with disturbances in C-cadherin trafficking (14Jarrett O. Stow J.L. Yap A.S. Key B. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2002; 46: 467-473PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to being constitutively active in polarized monolayers, E-cadherin internalization and trafficking is also subject to cellular regulation. Growth factors that induce epithelial cell scattering appear to promote E-cadherin internalization (15Kamei T. Matozaki T. Sakisaka T. Kodama A. Yokoyama S. Peng Y.-F. Nakano K. Takaishi K. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6776-6784Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 16Fujita Y. Krause G. Scheffner M. Zechner D. Leddy H.E. Behrens J. Sommer T. Birchmeier W. Nat.

Cell. 2001; 12: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and ARF6 GTPases (17Palacios F. Price L. Schweitzer J. Collard J.G. D'Souza-Schorey C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4973-4986Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and protein kinase C (19Le T.L. Joseph S.R. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C489-C499Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) can also influence cadherin trafficking. In the case of protein kinase C, this affects both internalization of E-cadherin from the membrane as well as its recycling back to the cell surface (19Le T.L. Joseph S.R. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C489-C499Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Finally, E-cadherin recycling may be regulated by the activity state of the cadherin itself: cell-cell contact appeared to withdraw cadherin from the recycling pathway, whereas disruption of cell-cell contacts promoted the internalization of E-cadherin (13Le T.L. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that the initial step of cadherin endocytosis is likely to be a key point in cadherin trafficking. This would be consistent with evidence that the endocytosis of a wide range of cell surface molecules is subject to stringent cellular control (20Mukherjee S. Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 759-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar, 21Nichols B.J. Lippincott-Schwartz J.

A wide repertoire of mechanisms exist for cell surface molecules to be internalized, including both classic clathrin-mediated endocytosis (22Brodsky F.M. Chen C.Y. Knuehl C. Towler M.C. Wakeham D.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 517-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) and a variety of clathrin-independent pathways (21Nichols B.J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 406-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Interestingly, recent studies have presented evidence that E-cadherin might be internalized by either clathrin-dependent (13Le T.L. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. J.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) or clathrin-independent mechanisms (18Akhtar N. Hotchin N.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), suggesting that multiple pathways may also exist for E-cadherin internalization. Many of these studies were conducted in fully confluent cultured cell monolayers, which more closely resemble the situation in mature epithelia with stable adhesive contacts, rather than the dynamic adhesive contacts formed during tissue reorganization. In the latter case, turnover of adhesion is likely to be rapid, requiring mechanisms for unbound cadherin molecules to be cleared away from regions of the cell surface undergoing remodeling (24Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1992; 69: 385-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In this study we therefore chose to focus on characterizing the initial fate of unbound E-cadherin on the cell surface of isolated MCF-7 and CHO 1The abbreviations used are: CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; EEA-1, early endosomal antigen-1; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; EEA-1, early endosomal antigen-1; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. cells. Combining surface labeling assays with light and immunoelectron microscopy our experiments identify a clathrin-independent pathway for E-cadherin internalization that is subject to regulation by ARF6. Cell Culture—MCF-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker), CHO cells in Hams' F-12 (BioWhittaker), and all media were supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen). CHO cells stably expressing human E-cadherin were used as described previously (25Kovacs E.M. Goodwin M. Ali R.G. Paterson A.D. Yap A.S. Curr.

Cells used for immunofluorescence were plated on glass coverslips. All transient transfections were carried out with LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were grown for 16–24 h before being used in experiments. Antibodies—Primary antibodies used were: 1) mouse monoclonal antibody HECD-1 raised against the ectodomain of human E-cadherin (a kind gift from Prof. Masatoshi Takeichi; Kyoto University), 2) human anti-early endosomal antigen-1 (EEA-1; a gift from Dr. Ban Hock Toh, Monash University), 3) rabbit anti-Rab-7 and 4) rabbit anti-HA (both provided by Prof. David James, University of Queensland), 5) rabbit anti-cathepsin D (UBI), 6) rabbit anti-GFP (Molecular Probes), and 7) rabbit anti-β-COP (a kind gift from Dr. Rohan Teasdale, University of Queensland). Secondary antibodies used were: 1) Alexa-488 conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes), 2) Cy3-conjugated donkey antimouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories), 3) Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 fragment-specific antibodies (Jackson Labs). F(ab′) fragments of hECD-1 were generated using the Immunopure IgG1 F(ab′) and F(ab′)2 preparation kit (Pierce). Internalization Assay—MCF-7 cultures were passaged 12 h before experiments, and on the day of the assay the cell medium was changed to Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 5 mm Ca2+ and 50 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and cells were allowed to equilibrate for 1 h. Samples were then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with HECD-1 F(ab′) fragments or intact HECD-1 IgG diluted in Hanks' balanced salt solution. Coverslips were washed with ice-cold PBS to remove the unbound antibody and the media was replaced with Hanks' balanced salt solution prewarmed to 37 °C. After incubation at 37 °C for varying periods of time, cells were then washed with PBS and returned to 4 °C. The residual surface-bound antibody was removed by acid washing (0.5 m acetic acid, 0.5 m NaCl; 3× 5 min washes) (27Ghosh R.N. Mallet W.G. Soe T.T. McGraw T.E. Maxfield F.R. J.

Cells were washed with PBS before fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde (in 10 mm PIPES, 2 mm MgCl, 2 mm KCl, 300 mm sucrose, and 2 mm EGTA) for 20 min at 4 °C.

Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 376-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Unless otherwise stated, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed with PBS, then permeabilized in 0.25% Triton X-100/PBS. After fixation and permeabilization, samples were washed in PBS, then incubated in blocking buffer (5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk in PBS) for 1 h. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer and incubated serially for 60 min at room temperature. After final washing with PBS, samples were mounted in 1% NPG, 50% glycerol/PBS. Images were acquired with an Olympus AX70 microscope and Orca I digital camera (Hamamatsu) using Metamorph Imaging Software (version 4.01, Universal Imaging Corp.). Images were compiled using Adobe Photoshop 6. Electron Microscopy—To characterize the surface distribution of E-cadherin, isolated MCF-7 cells were fixed with 0.5% glutaraldehyde, then incubated with HECD-1 IgG for 1 h, before sectioning and processing for electron microscopy as previously described (34Sabharanjak S. Sharma P. Parton R.G. Mayor S. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 411-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Surfacelabeled HECD-1 was detected using 5 nm anti-mouse gold. To quantitate the distribution of surface label, ∼400 gold particles were counted from sections of 15 independent cells. Itinerary of Surface-labeled E-cadherin Internalization—E-cadherin internalization was assayed with a surface labeling strategy that has been extensively used to characterize endocytosis of the transferrin receptor and many other cell surface proteins (35Mayor S. Presley J.F. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1257-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 36Ullrich O. Reinsch S. Urbe S. Zerial M. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). For these experiments we used MCF-7 cells, a well differentiated human breast cancer cell line that expresses endogenous E-cadherin. To maximize the rate of internalization, cells were passaged 12 h prior to experiments to obtain sparse, subconfluent cultures. This provided an optically amenable system where cell surface proteins were readily accessible for labeling. To label the surface pool of E-cadherin, cells were incubated at 4 °C with F(ab′) fragments or whole IgG of monoclonal antibody HECD-1 directed against the ectodomain of human E-cadherin. After washing to remove unbound antibody, samples were then warmed to 37 °C to allow internalization of surface-labeled E-cadherin to resume. At various times after release of the 4 °C block any residual antibody on the cell surface was stripped by washing with a high-salt/acid buffer (27Ghosh R.N. Mallet W.G. Soe T.T. McGraw T.E. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 923-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) and the samples were processed to detect the internalized label by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig. 1A, immediately after labeling at 4 °C, HECD-1 F(ab′) staining was found distributed throughout the free surface of cells as well as being concentrated in areas of cell-cell contact. High salt/acid washing immediately after labeling removed almost all staining (Fig. 1B), confirming efficient stripping of the surface-bound label. Within 5 min after warming cells to 37 °C, HECD-1 F(ab′) could be detected in peripheral cytoplasmic vesicles that were resistant to surface stripping (Fig. 1C). Vesicular staining of internalized HECD-1 F(ab′) increased progressively after release of the 4 °C block, becoming extensively distributed throughout the cytoplasm and in the perinuclear region after 30 min (Fig. 1, D–F). Comparison of E-cadherin Internalization with Clathrin-mediated Endocytosis—To begin to characterize the E-cadherin internalization pathway, we compared the localization of surface-labeled E-cadherin with that of transferrin, a well characterized marker of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (20Mukherjee S. Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 759-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar, 36Ullrich O. Reinsch S. Urbe S. Zerial M. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). Cells were surface-labeled with both HECD-1 and fluorescein-conjugated transferrin and their itineraries of internalization compared at various times after release of the 4 °C block. For these studies we used both whole HECD-1 IgG (Fig. 2, A–D) and HECD-1 F(ab′) fragments (Fig. 2, E and F) with identical results. After 15–30 min internalization (Fig. 2, B–D and F) HECD-1 co-localized extensively in vesicles that were also positive for transferrin, suggesting that at this time internalized E-cadherin and transferrin resided in the same compartment. However, a striking disparity was detected between E-cadherin and transferrin at earlier stages of internalization. After 5 min internalization (Fig. 2, A and E), although E-cadherin and transferrin were readily detected in distinct vesicles, these did not co-localize. This suggested that although the trafficking pathways for these two proteins merged at some stage, their initial entry pathways might be different. To pursue this we compared staining for endogenous clathrin with that of surface-labeled E-cadherin after 15 min internalization. Clathrin stained in two major patterns: a perinuclear distribution consistent with Golgi-associated clathrin and more diffuse peripheral puncta that likely represent both clathrincoated pits and coated vesicles (Fig. 2G). Little internalized E-cadherin co-localized with clathrin (Fig. 2G). This was most apparent at the cell periphery where E-cadherin and clathrin were clearly identified in quite separate structures (Fig. 2H). Internalized E-cadherin Enters the Early Endosomal Compartment—We then sought to characterize the relationship between internalized E-cadherin and the endosomal compartment. After 15–30 min internalization we found that many vesicles containing internalized HECD1-F(ab′) also stained for the early endosomal marker, EEA-1 (Fig. 3B). However, at 5 min we could detect no co-localization between EEA-1 and HECD1-F(ab′), which labeled quite distinct vesicles (Fig. 3A). In contrast, as has generally been reported (33Nielsen E. Severin F. Backer J.M. Hyman A.A. Zerial M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 376-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 37Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lutcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar), after 5 min many transferrin-positive vesicles were identified that also stained for EEA-1 (Fig. 3, C and D). This suggested that E-cadherin was internalized via an EEA-1-negative intermediary compartment before entering the early endosomal system. To confirm that E-cadherin was trafficked into an early endosomal compartment, we examined the pattern of cadherin uptake in cells transiently expressing a Rab5 mutant (Q79L) that causes fusion of early endosomes (33Nielsen E. Severin F. Backer J.M. Hyman A.A. Zerial M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 376-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 37Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lutcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3E, endocytosed E-cadherin accumulated in enlarged vesicles that coincided precisely with the localization of the Rab5 mutant transgene. This is consistent with previous reports that expression of this mutant causes cargo to accumulate in enlarged early endosomes (37Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lutcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). To assess whether E-cadherin could also enter the recycling endosomal compartment, we compared the localization of internalized E-cadherin with that of Rab11, a key marker of recycling endosomes (36Ullrich O. Reinsch S. Urbe S. Zerial M. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). After 30 min internalization, we found that a proportion of surface-labeled E-cadherin was found in vesicles that also stained for transiently transfected Rab 11-GFP (Fig. 3F). Taken together, these data indicated that internalized E-cadherin was trafficked to the early endosomal system, where at least a proportion was able to access recycling endosomes. In contrast, internalized E-cadherin was not found in Rab 7-positive vesicles (Fig. 4A), part of the late endosomal system. Nor was any co-localization seen in cells stained for cathepsin D (Fig. 4B), a protease found in lysosomes, or for β-COP, a marker of the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 4C). E-Cadherin Is Not Internalized by Caveolae in Isolated CHO Cells—It was recently suggested that E-cadherin may be internalized through a caveolar trafficking pathway, based on the striking observation that sustained Rac signaling in keratinocytes caused E-cadherin to accumulate in large caveolin-positive cytoplasmic vacuoles (18Akhtar N. Hotchin N.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To investigate this possibility in our system, we compared the localization of internalized E-cadherin and caveolin, an essential component of caveolae. Because MCF-7 cells have low levels of endogenous caveolin we used a CHO cell line that stably expresses human E-cadherin (hE-CHO cells) and which forms caveolae. hECHO cells were transiently transfected with caveolin-3 YFP (Cav3-YFP), a construct that is a faithful marker of caveolae at the light microscopic level (29Carozzi A.J. Roy S. Morrow I.C. Pol A. Wyse B. Clyde-Smith J. Prior I.A. Nixon S.J. Hancock J.F. Parton R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17944-17949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). hE-CHO cells effectively endocytosed surface-bound HECD-1 (both whole IgG and F(ab′) fragments), displaying a pattern of vesicular staining qualitatively similar to that seen in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 4D). Although Cav3-YFP was clearly detected in punctate structures consistent with caveolae, no co-localization with E-cadherin was seen at any stage during our endocytosis assays (Fig. 4D). It thus seemed unlikely that caveolae were principally responsible for E-cadherin internalization in our model system. Characterization of E-cadherin Internalization by Immunoelectron Microscopy—To further examine the initial step by which E-cadherin is internalized we employed electron microscopy in an attempt to identify distinct surface structures associated with E-cadherin (Fig. 5). Cells were fixed with glutaraldehyde, and the cell surface was then labeled with monoclonal antibody HECD-1 followed by 5 nm anti-mouse gold: under these conditions, only surface E-cadherin is accessible for immunolabeling. Labeling was found throughout the entire cell surface. Although most labeling was found on the undefined plasma membrane (83.8 + 5.3%, mean ± S.E., n = 406 gold particles counted), a significant proportion of gold particles were found in prominent invaginations of the plasma membrane (15.3 ± 5.1%), possibly indicative of ruffling activity or macropinocytosis (Fig. 5, A and B). Labeling for E-cadherin in clathrin-coated pits, in contrast, was extremely rare (1.0 ± 0.4% of surface gold; Fig. 5, C and D). Similar results were obtained after surface labeling cells for E-cadherin with both anti-cadherin and anti-mouse gold prior to allowing internalization of the E-cadherin complex for various times at 37 °C (results not shown). These observations indicated that E-cadherin did not show detectable concentrations in clathrin-coated pits relative to the general plasma membrane. Molecular Determinants of E-cadherin Endocytosis—To characterize the molecular regulation of E-cadherin internalization in isolated cells we first examined the potential role of dynamin, a GTPase implicated in various forms of endocytosis (22Brodsky F.M. Chen C.Y. Knuehl C. Towler M.C. Wakeham D.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 517-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 28Damke H. Binns D.D. Ueda H. Schmid S.L. Baba T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2578-2589Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with a well characterized dominantly interfering mutant (S45N) of dynamin. Consistent with its established role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (22Brodsky F.M. Chen C.Y. Knuehl C. Towler M.C. Wakeham D.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 517-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 28Damke H. Binns D.D. Ueda H. Schmid S.L. Baba T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2578-2589Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), expression of dynaminS45N effectively inhibited transferrin uptake in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 6, C and D). In these studies we quantitated uptake of surface label by scoring the number of cells that displayed a characteristic pattern of widely distributed, vesicular uptake throughout the cytoplasm. The vast majority of cells expressing dynaminS45N showed no vesicular staining of internalized transferrin whatsoever (Fig. 6E). Expression of dy"
https://openalex.org/W1995454630,"In this paper, we demonstrate that a protein from Bacillus subtilis (YqjM) shares many characteristic biochemical properties with the homologous yeast Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE); the enzyme binds FMN tightly but noncovalently, preferentially uses NADPH as a source of reducing equivalents, and forms charge transfer complexes with phenolic compounds such as p-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Like yeast OYE and other members of the family, YqjM catalyzes the reduction of the double bond of an array of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones including nitroester and nitroaromatic compounds. Although yeast OYE was the first member of this family to be discovered in 1933 and was the first flavoenzyme ever to be isolated, the physiological role of the family still remains obscure. The finding that α,β-unsaturated compounds are substrates provoked speculation that the OYE family might be involved in reductive degradation of xenobiotics or lipid peroxidation products. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate on the protein level that whereas YqjM shows a basal level of expression in B. subtilis, the addition of the toxic xenobiotic, trinitrotoluene, leads to a rapid induction of the protein in vivo denoting a role in detoxification. Moreover, we show that YqjM is rapidly induced in response to oxidative stress as exerted by hydrogen peroxide, demonstrating a potential physiological role for this enigmatic class of proteins."

Rational design of specific ligands requires detailed understanding of the molecular structure of the active site. The cytoplasmic side of the rough ER is the site for biosynthesis for membrane and secreted proteins, which are then transported to the lumen side across the ER membrane by translocation signal peptides at the N terminus. Many ER-resident steroidogenic enzymes are known to possess strong ER membrane association that presumably plays roles in their functionality. To the best of our knowledge, no structure of an ER-resident protein showing a trans-membrane association is available to date. Here, we report the crystal structure of the full-length, active ES purified from human placenta, as determined by x-ray crystallography at 2.60-Å resolution. The proximity of the putative membrane-spanning domain and lipid-associated regions to the active site suggests a direct influence of the lipid bilayer on the enzyme activity, thereby providing the first structural evidence of functional significance for membrane association in this class of microsomal enzymes. Purification and Crystallization—Details of purification and crystallization of the enzyme have been previously described (8Hernandez-Guzman F.G. Higashiyama T. Osawa Y. Ghosh D. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 78: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, the full-length enzyme in an active form was purified from human placenta. Diffraction quality crystals were obtained from 45–50% methylpentanediol in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, containing 0.10–0.20 m ammonium phosphate (monobasic) and 0.3% n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (BOG). The space group is P321 with unit cell dimensions of a = b = 116.98 Å, c = 102.66 Å, and α = β = 90°, γ = 120°. There are six symmetry-related positions, and the unit cell volume is 1.2 × 106 Å3. With a molecular mass of roughly 65 kDa, the specific volume for 1 molecule per asymmetric unit is 3.1 Å3/Da. Assuming a specific volume of 0.746 cm3/g for proteins, the solvent content of the unit cell is 60.3%. Data Collection—The native ES data was collected at the F-1 beam line of the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (Ithaca, NY). The station was equipped with a Quantum-210 CCD detector and an Oxford Cryostream cryostat. The crystal to detector distance was 250 mm, and the wavelength used was 0.948 Å. The diffraction data were collected in 110 frames, each of 1° oscillation and 20-s exposure. The data was processed and scaled using the programs Data Processing Suite (20Rossmann M.G. van Beek C.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1999; 55: 1631-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and MOSFLM (21Leslie A.G.W. Crystallographic Computing. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1990Google Scholar). A total of 150,699 observations were measured for 24,534 unique reflections to 2.60-Å resolution with an overall Rmerge value of 0.068 on intensities. The data overall was 97.4% complete, and the completeness and average intensity to S.D. ratio in the last shell (2.74–2.60 Å) were 96.2% and 3.1, respectively. Data for the heavy atom derivative crystals were gathered under cryogenic conditions at the in house R axis-IV image plate detector receiving x-rays (Cu Kα) from a rotating anode source and processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK (22Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar).

Two derivative data sets, each having the same single major mercury-binding site and prepared by soaking the crystals with HgCl2, were used for the purpose. The software package SOLVE (23Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar) was used to determine and refine the position of the heavy atom. The program package PHASES (24Furey W. Swaminathan S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 277: 590-620Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar) was used for phase combination, solvent flattening, and the final phase calculation. A summary of phase calculation, combination, and solvent-flattening is provided in Table II. Interpretation of the electron density map and model building was carried out using CHAIN (25Sack J.S. J. Mol. Graphics. 1988; 6: 224-225Crossref Google Scholar). A molecular replacement solution (using MOLREP from the CCP4 suite (26Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sec.

The identification of the molecular replacement solution was possible by cross-phasing the (mercury minus native) difference Fourier synthesis with phases from the correct molecular replacement solution. A single peak, corresponding to the mercury-binding site and having a height 4 times that of the next background peak, confirmed the correctness of the solution.Table IIPhasing results for two HgCl2 derivative data sets (HA7 and HA12)Data setResolution rangeNo. of reflections phasedR-centriccR-centric = Σh lack of closure(h)/ Σh|FPH - FP| for centric reflections only, where FPH and FP refer to the heavy atom derivative and parent measured structure factors, respectively.Phase combination resultsSolvent flattening resultsSIRaSIR, single isomorphous replacement.SASbSAS, single anomalous scattering.FOMdFOM, figure of merit = (cos Δαi), mean value of the cosine of the error in phase angle α of a reflection determined from the calculated probability function P(αi) for the reflection having the phase angle αi.Phasing powerePhasing power = mean (FH.A.(calc)(h)/lack of closure (h)).

Open table in a new tab The initial model was subjected to several rounds of rebuilding and refinement using the CNS software package (27Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gross P.

D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). Individual temperature factors of the atoms were refined isotropically. Several loop areas of the polypeptide chain, particularly in the C-terminal half of the molecule, displayed weakly defined density and high temperature factors (>65 Å2). The N-terminal His22 and two regions of the chain, a loop with residues 477–480 and the C-terminal residues 576–583, could not be modeled due to the lack of appreciable electron densities. The final protein model contained 549 (23–575, with residues 477–480 missing) out of a total of 562 residues (positions 22–583). Despite the high solvent content of the crystal (60.3%), only well ordered water molecules with hydrogen bonds to side chains were included in the model. Two N-acetylglucosamine molecules each covalently linked to Asn47 and Asn259 side chains were modeled. Although additional electron densities were apparent at two other possible glycosylation sites (Asn333 and Asn459), they were not sufficiently defined for modeling. In addition, 130 water oxygens, one phosphate ion, and two BOG molecules were also included in the model. One of them was found in the putative transmembrane region, and the other was found on a hydrophobic patch near the 2-fold axis.

Open table in a new tab Quality of the Model—Fig. 1, a and b, show representative experimental and refined electron density maps, respectively, for the putative transmembrane helices. The atomic model for the region is shown in Fig. 1c. The overall secondary and tertiary structures of the molecule are shown in Fig. 2a and the folding topology in Fig. 2b. The residues of the full-length functional ES are numbered from 22 to 583. The N-terminal histidine and residues 477–480 in a weakly defined loop could not be modeled. In addition, the C-terminal residues 576–583 did not have any appreciable electron density. The backbone conformation of one residue, Ala369, was in the disallowed range despite its well defined electron density. More than 98% of all nonproline and nonglycine residues were in the allowed ranges of backbone conformations defined by Ramachandran plot. The crystallographic R-factor for all reflections was 0.25, and Rfree was 0.30. The average temperature factor (B) for the protein molecule was 58.2 Å2, in good agreement with an overall temperature factor of 62.5 Å2 calculated from the Wilson plot. The average R, Rfree, and <B> values calculated for 31 membrane protein structures (28Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27935) Google Scholar), having at least 2500 atoms in the asymmetric unit and determined at a resolution between 2.2 and 3.3 Å are 0.24, 0.29, and 56 Å2, respectively. Thus, the overall quality of the ES model is typical of membrane protein structures of similar size determined at a medium resolution range.Fig. 2a, a stereographic ribbon diagram of the ES structure showing the secondary and tertiary structures.

SD1 and SD2 and TM are highlighted in three different colors.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Description of the Overall Structure—The three-dimensional structure of the full-length ES from human placenta as determined by x-ray crystallography is shown in Fig. 2a. The tertiary structure consists of two domains: a globular (55 × 60 × 70 Å), polar domain containing the catalytic site and the putative transmembrane domain consisting of two antiparallel hydrophobic α-helices. The major polar domain consists of two subdomains with the α/β sandwich fold (Fig. 2b). Subdomain 1 (SD1), wound around a central 11-stranded (strands 1, 2, 4–11, and 17) mixed β-sheet flanked by 13 α-helices/helical turns (helices 1–7 and 10–15), contains the catalytic core. Subdomain 2 (SD2), consisting of roughly 110 C-terminal residues and wound around a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (strands 13–16) flanked by α-helix 16, packs against turn and loop regions of the β-sheet of subdomain 1. The two putative transmembrane helices protrude on one side of the nearly spherical polar domain, thereby giving the overall molecule a “mushroom-like” shape. The polar domain resembles in shape, size, and fold the two known structures of the soluble forms of human sulfatases, aryl sulfatases A (ASA) (29Lukatela G. Krauss N. Theis K. Selmer T. Gieselmann V. Figura K.V. Saenger W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3654-3664Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and B (ASB) (30Bond C.S. Clements P.R. Ashby S.J. Collyer C.A. Harrop S.J. Hopwood J.J. Guss J.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 277-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). A comparison of three sequences is shown in Fig. 3a. The sequence identities of ES were 32 and 24% with ASA and ASB, respectively (Protein Data Bank codes 1AUK and 1FSU, respectively). The similarity of the tertiary structures is evident when three structures are superimposed (Fig. 3b). The root mean-squared deviations for 151 α-carbon atoms of identical/conserved residues were 0.90 and 1.02 Å for ES:1AUK and ES:1FSU, respectively. However, in addition to the insertion of the transmembrane domain in ES, there are significant additions, deletions, and substitutions in ES, especially in the C-terminal SD2, which are critical to its membrane association and anchoring of the catalytic domain to the membrane surface. The Active Site Architecture—The location of the transmembrane domain is such that the opening to the active site, buried deep in a cavity in the “gill” of the “mushroom,” rests near the membrane surface. A close-up view of the catalytic site is shown in Fig. 4a. The catalytic amino acid hydroxylformylglycine (FG)75, created by posttranslational modification of Cys75 (31Schmidt B. Selmer T. Ingendoh A. von Figura K. Cell. 1995; 82: 271-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), was found to be covalently linked to a sulfate moiety (i.e. as a sulfate ester of FG (FGS)). A large spherical electron density at the center of the catalytic site near the FGS75 side chain was interpreted to be the cation required for the ES activity. The refinement was carried out with three possible bivalent cations, a Mg2+, Ca2+, or Mn2+, at the metal binding site. Refinement with a Ca2+ ion at the site resulted in a temperature factor of 41.4 Å2, which correlated very well with the average temperature factor of 43 Å2 of eight coordinating oxygen atoms from side chains and exhibited no residual electron density (positive or negative) at the metal center. A Mg2+ and a Mn2+ at the site, on the other hand, yielded temperature factors of 23.6 and 51.0 Å2, respectively. Although neither can be completely ruled out, Ca2+, in all likelihood, is the cation present in the crystal structure of ES. ASB (Protein Data Bank code 1FSU) also has a Ca2+ at the active site (30Bond C.S. Clements P.R. Ashby S.J. Collyer C.A. Harrop S.J. Hopwood J.J. Guss J.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 277-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Whereas the oxygen atoms of the Asp35, Asp36, Asp342, Gln343, and FGS75 side chains serve as ligands for the bivalent cation (Ca2+... O distances range between 2.2 and 2.8 Å), Lys134, Lys368, and Arg79 are involved in neutralization of negative charges of the carboxylic moieties. The positively charged amino groups of the Lys134 and Lys368 side chains are also within contact distance (2.7–3.1 Å) of the sulfate oxygens of FGS75 (Fig. 4a). In addition, two sulfate oxygens (Oδ2 and Oγ2) are within coordination distances of Ca2+ (2.6–2.7 Å). Several histidine residues in the immediate vicinity may play important roles in catalysis as well. The imidazole ring of His136 is within a hydrogen-bonding distance (2.6 Å) of the hydroxyl of FGS, and His290 Nϵ2 is 2.6 Å away from the sulfate oxygen (Oδ2) of FGS. Also, the His346 side chain is linked to Lys368 and the Thr291 side chain via a bridging water molecule. The main chain NH groups of FGS75 and Thr76 point toward the sulfate-binding cavity and may thus be responsible for the formation of a oxyanion hole. A few additional solvent molecules, the presence of which may be important for the completion of the hydrolysis, are located inside the substrate-binding cavity. The catalytic end of the active site in ES is highly homologous to those in ASA and ASB. Nine of the 10 catalytically important residues, namely Asp35, Asp36, FGS75, Arg79, Lys134, His136, His290, Asp342, and Lys368, are identical in all three enzymes. When these nine α-carbon atom positions were superimposed by least-squares minimization, the root mean-squared deviation was 0.39 Å between ES and either ASA or ASB. The 10th residue is Gln343, a ligand to the cation, which is an asparagine in both ASA and ASB. However, the substrate binding end of the catalytic cavity has a considerably different architecture in ES. In Fig. 4b, a E1 sulfate molecule is placed in the active site with its sulfate moiety superimposed with the crystallographically observed sulfate of FGS75. The resulting model of the covalently linked substrate mimics the first step of the proposed mechanism (see “Discussion”). Residues Leu74, Arg98, Thr99, Val101, Leu103, Leu167, Val177, Phe178, Thr180, Gly181, Thr484, His485, Val486, and Phe488 surround the steroid backbone, yielding mostly hydrophobic contacts and could therefore be involved in substrate recognition. Many of the residues from the membrane-associated regions described above line the groove leading to the active site. Transmembrane Domain—Two antiparallel helices 8 and 9, each about 40 Å long and situated between residues 179 and 241, protrude out of the catalytic polar domain, shown in Fig. 1c. Consisting primarily of hydrophobic residues, the helices probably insert into the lipid bilayer. Side chains of Arg184 and Lys183, the only two charged residues on the helices, are in the proximity to interact with surface phosphate moieties. The presence of Pro189 nearby causing a bend in helix 8 could help these side chains to orient toward the surface polar groups. Other polar residues in the domain are Gln191, Thr196, Thr199, and Asn204 on helix 8, a free sulfahydryl group Cys205 on the last turn of the helix, His210 on the short β-stretch connecting the two helices, and Ser218 and Thr228 on helix 9. Another proline reside, Pro212, is located at the N terminus of helix 9. The two helices interdigitate tightly with each other through hydrophobic interactions among leucine, isoleucine, valine, alanine, and phenylalanine side chains, burying 1220 Å2 of accessible surface between them, about one-fifth of the combined surface area of two helices. In analogy with previously described packing topology of parallel dimeric transmembrane helices (32Fleming K.G. Engelman D.M. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2001; 45: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 33MacKenzie K.R. Prestegard J.H. Engelman D.M. Science. 1997; 276: 131-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar), antiparallel helices 8 and 9 have a right-handed crossover with a crossing angle of about –21°, similar to –40° observed previously (33MacKenzie K.R. Prestegard J.H. Engelman D.M. Science. 1997; 276: 131-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Near the opening to the active site cleft, a constellation of large hydrophobic side chains, Phe178, Phe182, Phe187, Phe230, Phe233, Tyr236, and Phe237 from the transmembrane domain and Phe104, Tyr493 (from a helical turn 490–493), Trp550, Phe553, Leu554 (from the one-turn α-helix 17; residues 550–553), and Trp555 of the catalytic domain line the surface of a hydrophobic “tunnel” leading to the active site (Fig. 1c). The Arg98 and Thr99 side chains position themselves as gatekeepers to the “tunnel” (Fig. 4b). Further above, shown at the top of Fig. 1c, the disulfide bridge between Cys170 and Cys242"

Here, we describe a survey of such factors in the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana, and the characterization of two of them, AtbZIP10 and AtbZIP25. Expression analysis by in situ hybridization shows that the occurrence of their mRNAs in the seed starts from early stages of development, peaks at maturation, and declines later in seed development, matching temporally and spatially those of the seed storage protein genes encoding 2S albumins and cruciferins. Gel mobility shift assays showed that AtbZIP10 and AtbZIP25 bind the ACGT boxes present in At2S and CRU3 promoters. Moreover, using the yeast two-hybrid system we show that AtbZIP10 and AtbZIP25 can interact in vivo with ABI3, an important regulator of gene expression in the seed of Arabidopsis. Transient expression analyses of a reporter gene under the control of the At2S1 promoter in transgenic plants overexpressing ectopically AtbZIP10, AtbZIP25, and ABI3 reveal that none of these factors could activate significantly the reporter gene when expressed individually. However, co-expression of AtbZIP10/25 with ABI3 resulted in a remarkable increase in the activation capacity over the At2S1 promoter, suggesting that they are part of a regulatory complex involved in seed-specific expression. This study shows a common mechanism of ABI3 in regulating different seed-specific genes through combinatorial interactions with particular bZIP proteins and a conserved role of O2-like bZIPs in monocot and dicot species.

During seed development, storage reserves accumulate mostly in the form of carbohydrates and proteins, whose degradation upon germination will provide nutrients to the growing seedling before the photosynthetic capacity is fully acquired. Seed storage proteins (SSP) 1The abbreviations used are: SSP, seed storage protein; TF, transcription factor; bZIP, basic leucine zipper; O2, OPAQUE2; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; aa, amino acids; MAT, maturation gene class; AD, activation domain; BD, binding domain; GUS, β-glucoronidase. are specifically synthesized in developing seeds, both in the endosperm and in the embryo. In the seed of monocotyledoneous species, the former is the predominant reserve tissue, whereas in dicotyledoneous plants the endosperm is commonly re-absorbed as maturation proceeds, and storage proteins are preferentially accumulated in the embryo. Because SSP-encoding genes are specifically induced and tightly regulated during seed development, they represent an interesting model system for studying the mechanisms of temporal and tissue-specific gene regulation. In the developing seed, different programs of gene expression have been defined that comprise distinct classes of genes that are coordinately regulated (1Hughes D.W. Galau G.A. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 358-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 2Parcy F. Valon C. Raynal M. Gaubier-Comella P. Delseny M. Giraudat J. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1567-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The MAT (maturation) class includes major SSP genes (like 2S albumins and 12S globulins) expressed at early and mid-maturation phases, whereas the LEA (late embryogenesis abundant) class includes primarily genes involved in the acquisition of desiccation tolerance expressed at later stages of maturation (3Wobus U. Weber H. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1999; 2: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 4Hoekstra F.A. Golovina E.A. Buitink J. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 431-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). Unraveling the molecular basis of seed-specific gene expression has been mainly focused on the identification of cis-acting promoter elements and associated transcription factors (TFs). Both aspects have been considerably studied in monocots due to the importance of cereal seeds as crops, but in dicot species the molecular aspects of this regulation are still less understood. In cereals, the bipartite endosperm box (5Albani D. Hammond-Kosack M.C.U. Smith C. Conlan S. Colot V. Holdsworth M. Bevan M.W. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 171-184PubMed Google Scholar, 6Carbonero P.

Martýnez M. Isabel-La Moneda I. Carbonero P. Plant J. 2002; 29: 453-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) are important regulatory elements, repeatedly found in the promoters of SSP genes. These cis-elements are bound by TFs of the bZIP, DNA binding with one finger (DOF), and MYB classes (8Diaz I. Vicente-Carbajosa J.2 Abraham Z. Martýnez M. Isabel-La Moneda I. Carbonero P. Plant J. 2002; 29: 453-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 9Schmidt R.J. Burr F.A. Aukerman M.J. Burr B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

One of the first-described transcription factors in plants and probably one of the best studied, involved in this regulation is the bZIP protein from maize OPAQUE2 (O2). Mutations in either the O2 gene or in its binding sites within the endosperm box of zein promoters, result in a dramatic reduction in the level of zein transcription (12Schmidt R.J. Ketudat M. Aukerman M. Hoschek G. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 689-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The central role of O2-like factors in seed-specific expression has been well documented in other cereal species, such as wheat (SPA), barley (BLZ1 and BLZ2), rice (RISBZ1 and RITA1), Sorghum (SBO2), and Coix (CLJO2) (5Albani D.

In dicot plants, the study of SSP gene promoters by deletion analysis, site-specific mutagenesis or gain-of-function approaches has revealed the importance of bZIP target sites to provide full activity and in conferring tissue specificity (19Vincentz M.

It has been also demonstrated that these sites are bound in vitro by maize O2 or O2-like factors from cereals, resulting in efficient activation in planta when they are co-transformed into the dicot plant tissues (19Vincentz M. Leite A. Neshich G. Vriend G. Mattar C. Barros L. Weinberg D. de Almeida E.R. de Carvalho M.P. Aragao F. Gander E.S. Plant Mol.

Moreover, the fact that target sites of O2-like bZIPs in the promoters of monocot SSP genes are necessary for seed expression in transgenic dicot plants (24Matzke A.J. Stoger E.M. Schernthaner J.P. Matzke M.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1990; 14: 323-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 25Takaiwa F. Oono K. Kato A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 16: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) suggests that similar, yet uncharacterized, factors are important in the regulation of SSP genes in the dicot embryos. In Arabidopsis and in closely related species from the genus Brassica, regulatory cis-acting elements required for specific expression of SSP genes have been determined (22Ezcurra I. Ellerstrom M. Wycliffe P. Stalberg K. Rask L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 699-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 26Ellerstrom M. Stalberg K. Ezcurra I. Rask L. Plant Mol.

Both in 2S albumin and napin gene promoters these include the RY motif and the ACGT box, representing putative targets for B3 and bZIP transcription factors, respectively. Alternative strategies, like the analysis of genetic mutants with altered patterns of gene expression in the seed, have also led to the discovery of genes corresponding to TFs responsible for these variations. Remarkably, factors with a B3 domain such as ABI3, FUS3, or LEC2, potentially implicated in the regulation of SSP genes through the RY element, were found among them (28Giraudat J. Hauge B.M. Valon C. Smalle J. Parcy F. Goodman H.M. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 1251-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar, 29Luerssen H. Kirik V. Herrmann P. Misera S.

A. 2001; 98: 11806-11811Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Concerning the interaction with the ACGT boxes in these promoters, several bZIP proteins of the ABI5 group expressed in the seed have been identified as putative candidates to participate in this regulation (31Choi H. Hong J. Ha J. Kang J. Kim S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1723-1730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar, 32Bensmihen S. Rippa S. Lambert G. Jublot D. Pautot V. Granier F. Giraudat J. Parcy F. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1391-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). However, mutations in the ABI5 and EEL genes were reported not to affect the expression of early and mid-maturation SSPs (e.g. 2S albumin genes) but instead of those genes expressed at late embryogenesis (e.g. LEA protein genes), suggesting that different bZIP factors should be involved in their regulation (32Bensmihen S. Rippa S. Lambert G. Jublot D. Pautot V. Granier F. Giraudat J. Parcy F. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1391-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). As part of a project devoted to the study of seed-specific transcriptional control, we focused on the identification of Arabidopsis bZIP transcription factors related to OPAQUE2, as putative candidates for the regulation through ACGT boxes of early and mid-maturation SSP genes. Here, we present evidence that two bZIP factors of the OPAQUE2 family in Arabidopsis are involved in MAT SSP gene activation in a concerted manner with ABI3. Plant Material—Arabidopsis thaliana seeds from Columbia (Col-0) and C24 were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (Ohio). Seeds from A. thaliana C24 expressing ectopically ABI3 (2Parcy F. Valon C. Raynal M. Gaubier-Comella P. Delseny M. Giraudat J. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1567-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) were obtained from the authors. Plants were grown under standard conditions in growth chambers at 22 °C with a 16-h photoperiod. Isolation and Analyses of cDNAs and Genomic Clones of O2-like bZIPs—cDNAs encoding AtbZIP9, -10, -25, and -63 were obtained from public Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) collections or amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR. The corresponding genomic clones were isolated from an A. thaliana library prepared in λGEM11 (Promega), kindly donated by J. Paz-Ares. Screening of the Arabidopsis genomic library was performed following general procedures (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 2.108-2.117Google Scholar) with gene-specific probes corresponding to cDNA fragments encoding the following protein regions: AtbZIP9, aa 1–100; AtbZIP10, aa 1–125; AtbZIP25, aa 300–403; AtbZIP63, aa 220–314 and previously shown not to cross-hybridize. DNA sequences were obtained using the ABI PRISM 377 dye terminator sequencing system and the ABI PRISM 377 DNA sequence analyzer (PerkinElmer-Applied Biosystems). Analyses of DNA and deduced protein sequences were done with computer services under the European Bioinformatics Institute (www.ebi.ac.uk/). Sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses were performed using ClustalW and Phyllip packages, respectively, at the server of the DNA Data Bank of Japan (www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/). Detection of conserved domains in protein sequences was done with MAST/MEME tools (meme.sdsc.edu/meme/website/meme.html). Northern Blots and in Situ Hybridization Analyses—Northern blot analysis was performed using total RNA from different Arabidopsis tissues as described in Ref. 2Parcy F. Valon C. Raynal M. Gaubier-Comella P. Delseny M. Giraudat J. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1567-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar. Gene-specific probes (see above) were labeled by random priming following standard procedures (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 2.108-2.117Google Scholar). In situ hybridization was performed according to Ref. 34Ferrándiz C. Gu Q. Martienssen R. Yanofsky M.F. Development. 2000; 127: 725-734PubMed Google Scholar with digoxigenin-labeled antisense RNA probes generated according to the manufacturer's specifications (Roche Diagnostics). Gene-specific probes, described above, were cloned into pGEM-T easy (Promega), and labeled RNA was synthesized on linearized templates using T7 or SP6 polymerase depending on insert orientation. An ABI3-specific probe was obtained by PCR amplification of a cDNA fragment corresponding to the last 103 aa of the ABI3 protein. This fragment was cloned into pGEM-T easy and used to synthesize RNA probes following the same procedure. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—The cDNAs encoding AtbZIP10, AtbZIP25, and ABI3 proteins were cloned into the expression vector pRSET-B (Invitrogen), and O2 cDNA into pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Biosciences) as a translational fusion to glutathione S-transferase (GST). After transformation into the appropriate strains, BL21(DE3)/pLysS and XL1-Blue, recombinant proteins were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thio-galactopyranoside (IPTG) for 1 h, and cellular pellets were used to prepare crude protein extracts. Alternatively, proteins were synthesized using the TnT system (Promega). Experimental conditions for electrophoretic mobility shift assays were essentially as previously described (10Vicente-Carbajosa J. Moose S.P. Parsons R.L. Schmidt R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Probes were generated by annealing overlapping oligonucleotides, corresponding to specific regions of the AtS1 and CRU3 promoters. The following oligonucleotides were used: ATS1WTS, 5′-TTCTTACACGTGAA-3′; ATS1WTAS, 5′-GAGTTCACGTGTAAGAA-3′; ATS1MTS, 5′-TTCTTACAaGgGAA-3′; ATS1MTAS, 5′-GAGTTCcCtTGTAA-3′; and CRU3WTS, 5′-TAATCCTACGTGGC-3′; CRU3WTAS, 5′-TGAGCCACGTAGGA-3′; CRU3MTS, 5′-TAATCCTAaGgGGC-3′; CRU3WTAS, 5′-TGAGCCcCtTAGGA-3′. Probes were end-labeled with [32P]dATP by the fill-in reaction (Klenow exo-free DNA polymerase; United States Biochemical) and purified from an 8% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (39:1 cross-linking). Binding reactions contained 0.5 ng of 32P-labeled probes. Yeast Strains and Methods—Strains HF7c and SFY526 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae carrying LacZ (β-galactosidase) and HIS3 (imidazole glycerol phosphate dehydratase) reporter genes under the control of a truncated Gal1 promoter that contains Gal4-responsive elements (Gal1UAS) were obtained from Clontech. The effector plasmids pGBT9 and pGAD424 (Clontech), which contain the alcohol dehydrogenase I (AdhI) promoter fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain (Gal4DBD; pGBT9 vector) or to the Gal4 DNA activation domain (Gal4AD, pGAD424 vector), respectively, were used to generate translational fusions with AtbZIP10, AtbZIP25, or ABI3 or with particular fragments derived from them (ABI3 N: aa 1–525, ABI3 C: aa 400–720; AtbZIP10 C: aa 184–410; and AtbZIP25 C: aa 200–403). All constructs were generated by PCR amplification with selected primers and verified for in-frame fusions and sequence fidelity. Yeast transformation, activity assays for β-galactosidase in liquid cultures and colony growth in His-depleted medium, were done at 30 or 23 °C, according to the manufacturer's instructions with minor modifications (13Vicente-Carbajosa J.

Leaves from Arabidopsis plants grown under sterile conditions were isolated from a rosette stage, placed onto a 5-cm dish agar-MS/2 medium, and shot in sets of six. After bombardment leaves were incubated in the same plate for 24 h, and GUS activity was quantified by chemiluminescence (GUS light kit, Tropix) and expressed as relative luminescence units (RLU) per μg of protein. AtS1::GUS reporter vector is a pUC19-derived plasmid containing the β-glucuronidase reporter gene under the control of the At2S1 promoter and fused to the 3′-terminator of the nopaline synthase gene (3′-nos). Effector plasmids for the expression of AtbZIP10, AtbZIP25, and ABI3 were generated by cloning the corresponding cDNAs under the control of the CaMV35S promoter and a 3′-nos terminator in pBSII (Stratagene). A. thaliana transgenic plants overexpressing AtbZIP10 and AtbZIP25, were generated by Agrobacterium transformation following procedures referred to in Ref. 34Ferrándiz C. Gu Q. Martienssen R. Yanofsky M.F. Development. 2000; 127: 725-734PubMed Google Scholar and using the vector pROKII, in which the expression of both cDNAs is driven by the CaMV35S promoter. Plants overexpressing ABI3, previously described (2Parcy F. Valon C. Raynal M. Gaubier-Comella P. Delseny M. Giraudat J. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1567-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), were a kind gift from the authors. The Arabidopsis Genome Contains Four Genes Encoding OPAQUE2-related bZIPs—The completion of the A. thaliana sequencing project (35The Arabidopsis Genome Initiative Nature. 2000; 408: 796-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (7211) Google Scholar) facilitates the identification of genes encoding defined protein families within the genome. O2-related bZIPs have several features that make them distinguishable from other members of the bZIP group of TFs (Fig. 1A). The bZIP region has an extended zipper comprising up to nine leucine heptad repeats with a high degree of sequence conservation; outside this domain, other sequence signatures are also shared specifically within the O2 family. Among 75 bZIP-encoding genes annotated in the Arabidopsis genome (36Riechmann J.L. Heard J. Martin G. Reuber L. Jiang C. Keddie J. Adam L. Pineda O. Ratcliffe O.J. Samaha R.R. Creelman R. Pilgrim M.

CABI Publishing, Wallingford, UK2000: 27-41Google Scholar) schematically represented in Fig. 1A, allowed the identification of four genes, AtbZIP10, AtbZIP25, AtbZIP63, and AtbZIP9 as the only members of the O2 family in Arabidopsis. Naming of these genes followed the nomenclature proposed by the EU-Regulatory Gene Initiative in the Arabidopsis project (37Jakoby M. Weisshaar B. Droge-Laser W. Vicente-Carbajosa J. Tiedemann J. Kroj T. Parcy F. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 106-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence alignments and comparisons with other O2 members in different plant species, led to the recognition of similar structural signatures common to these TFs. The results of such analyses are summarized in Fig. 1A, where the occurrence of domains 1–6, alongside the conserved bZIP region, is indicated for each individual member of the family. Among the four Arabidopsis O2-like bZIP proteins, AtbZIP10 shares the maximum number of conserved domains with members of the family in other species, and in particular with maize O2 and O2-like cereal proteins. The phylogenetic tree in Fig. 1B, based on sequence similarities of the bZIP region, shows that AtbZIP25 is very closely related to AtbZIP10, suggesting that both genes might represent redundant functions. AtbZIP63 forms a clade together with parsley CPFR2 and soybean G/HBF, two dicot bZIPs putatively involved in responses to pathogen and environmental stress (38Weisshaar B. Armstrong G.A. Block A. da Costa e Silva O. Hahlbrock K. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1777-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 39Droge-Laser W. Kaiser A. Lindsay W.P. Halkier B.A. Loake G.J. Doerner P. Dixon R.A. Lamb C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 726-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Finally, AtbZIP9 is related to RITA1 and other rice bZIPs of yet unknown functions (15Izawa T. Foster R. Nakajima M. Shimamoto K. Chua N.H. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1277-1287PubMed Google Scholar). AtbZIP10 and AtbZIP25 Are Expressed in the Developing Seed—For a transcription factor to participate in the regulation of seed storage protein genes, a necessary requisite is to be expressed in the developing seed. Consequently, the expression patterns of the four O2-like bZIPs from Arabidopsis were investigated by Northern blot analysis. Total RNA samples isolated from different tissues, including siliques at two developmental stages, were hybridized after electrophoretic separation to gene-specific probes corresponding to AtbZIP10, AtbZIP25, AtbZIP63, and AtbZIP9 genes. As shown in Fig. 2 the four genes are expressed in roots (R), shoots (S), rosette leaves (L), and flowers (F), but only hybridization to the AtbZIP10 and AtbZIP25 probes presented intense signals in lanes S1 and S2, containing RNAs from siliques. If AtbZIP10 and AtbZIP25 were regulators of SSP gene expression, an overlapping pattern of expression of these genes should be anticipated. To explore this possible relationship, the same blot was subsequently hybridized with a probe specific for a 2S albumin gene. The peak for the TF genes was at the S1 stage whereas that for the 2S gene was at the later S2 stage of silique development. The patterns of AtbZIP10/25 and 2S mRNA accumulation are therefore consistent with the possibility of the former being regulators of this SSP gene. To clarify whether the signals detected in Northern blots derived specifically from the seed or from other silique tissues, a more precise expression analysis, namely in situ mRNA hybridization, was done for these genes (Fig. 3). AtbZIP63 and AtbZIP9 mRNAs could not be detected in developing seeds, AtbZIP9 expression being restricted to the valve vascular veins in the siliques (data not shown). In contrast, expression in the seed could be clearly detected for AtbZIP10 and AtbZIP25, whose patterns of expression were found to be identical throughout seed development. AtbZIP10/25 transcripts were present from early stages of development both in the developing embryo and, at lower levels, in the endosperm. Expression of AtbZIP10/25 decreased as development proceeded. At later stages, they were expressed at very low levels in the mature embryo and the remaining endosperm, but were strongly up-regulated in the inner layer of the seed coat. AtbZIP10/25 RNA could also be detected in the lignified inner subepidermal layer of the valves. To test for possible overlapping patterns of expression of AtbZIP10/25 and ABI3, an important regulator of gene expression in the Arabidopsis seed (28Giraudat J. Hauge B.M. Valon C. Smalle J. Parcy F. Goodman H.M. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 1251-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar), in situ hybridization with an ABI3 probe was also performed. ABI3 RNA was detected in the embryos, endosperm, and outer teguments of the seed throughout seed development, with a pattern similar to that previously shown for AtbZIP10/25. However, in contrast to AtbZIP10/25 expression, which is detected preferentially in the embryo, ABI3 RNA levels were high, both in the endosperm and in the embryo, even at later stages of seed development. In mature seeds, ABI3 expression was also strong in the outer layers of the seed coat AtbZIP10 and AtbZIP25 Bind to ACGT Core Sequences in Seed Storage Protein Gene Promoter; Effect of ABI3 on Binding Affinities—Arabidopsis major seed storage proteins are the arabidins (2S albumins) and cruciferins (12S globulins). While 2S albumins map to a single locus, as a four tandem repeat, with minimal sequence divergence, cruciferins comprise a gene family with at least three different members (CRU1, CRU2, and CRU3). All these genes are expressed in the embryo in a coordinated fashion during the early and midstages of seed maturation. Sequence comparisons of these Arabidopsis SSP gene promoters revealed the presence of conserved ACGT boxes. Similar boxes in Brassica napin promoters have been shown to be critical for their expression in seeds (22Ezcurra I. Ellerstrom M. Wycliffe P. Stalberg K. Rask L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 69"
https://openalex.org/W2087634948,"RelB is an unusual member of the NF-κB transcription factor family that acts as both a transcriptional activator as well as a repressor of NF-κB-dependent gene expression. Although RelB promotes gene expression when it associates with p50/NF-κB1 or p52/NF-κB2, the precise molecular mechanisms through which it represses NF-κB remain unclear. To examine this inhibitory function in more detail, we employed reporter gene assays and found that RelB represses at the level of RelA. Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift analysis revealed that in vitro translated RelB impaired the DNA binding activity of RelA and that overexpressed RelB significantly reduced tumor necrosis factor-α-induced RelA activity in murine embryonic fibroblasts. Intriguingly, this inhibitory effect was due to the formation of RelA·RelB heterodimers that were unable to bind to κB sites in vitro strongly suggesting that these newly described NF-κB dimers cannot bind DNA. Expression pattern analysis revealed that RelA·RelB heterodimers appeared at relatively low levels in both lymphoid and non-lymphoid cells. However, the presence of these complexes increased following stimulation with phorbolesters or lipopolysaccharide or by overexpression of constitutively active IKKβ. Functional characterization of RelA·RelB heterodimers in NIH3T3 murine embryonic fibroblasts revealed that they are not regulated by IκB proteins and are located in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that sequestration of RelA in transcriptionally inactive RelA·RelB complexes provides a molecular mechanism that may explain the repressive role of RelB on NF-κB-dependent gene expression. RelB is an unusual member of the NF-κB transcription factor family that acts as both a transcriptional activator as well as a repressor of NF-κB-dependent gene expression. Although RelB promotes gene expression when it associates with p50/NF-κB1 or p52/NF-κB2, the precise molecular mechanisms through which it represses NF-κB remain unclear. To examine this inhibitory function in more detail, we employed reporter gene assays and found that RelB represses at the level of RelA. Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift analysis revealed that in vitro translated RelB impaired the DNA binding activity of RelA and that overexpressed RelB significantly reduced tumor necrosis factor-α-induced RelA activity in murine embryonic fibroblasts.

However, the presence of these complexes increased following stimulation with phorbolesters or lipopolysaccharide or by overexpression of constitutively active IKKβ. Functional characterization of RelA·RelB heterodimers in NIH3T3 murine embryonic fibroblasts revealed that they are not regulated by IκB proteins and are located in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that sequestration of RelA in transcriptionally inactive RelA·RelB complexes provides a molecular mechanism that may explain the repressive role of RelB on NF-κB-dependent gene expression. NF-κB describes a family of ubiquitously expressed transcription factors that play crucial roles in regulating innate and adaptive immunity, cell differentiation, and apoptosis (1Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3260) Google Scholar). NF-κB is composed of a dimer of distinct members of the Rel protein family (RelA, c-Rel, RelB, p50, and p52), and in the majority of non-stimulated cells it is maintained inactive in the cytoplasm via association with members of a family of small inhibitory proteins named the IκBs. Following stimulation of cells with a wide variety of agents, including TNFα, 1The abbreviations used are: TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; IKK, IκB kinase, IκB; inhibitor of NF-κB; PMA, phorbol 12-mystrate 13-acetate; IB, immunoblot; IP, immunoprecipitation; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; RHD, Rel homology domain; MEF, murine embryonic fibroblast; Ab, antibody; PVDF, polyvi-nylidene difluoride; HA, hemagglutinin; IL-7, interleukin-7.1The abbreviations used are: TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; IKK, IκB kinase, IκB; inhibitor of NF-κB; PMA, phorbol 12-mystrate 13-acetate; IB, immunoblot; IP, immunoprecipitation; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; RHD, Rel homology domain; MEF, murine embryonic fibroblast; Ab, antibody; PVDF, polyvi-nylidene difluoride; HA, hemagglutinin; IL-7, interleukin-7. LPS, or phorbol esters, IκB proteins become phosphorylated on two amino-terminal serine residues through the activity of a specific upstream kinase complex named the IκB kinase (IKK). This phosphorylation targets the IκB proteins for ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasomal pathway enabling the free NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus where it binds to specific DNA elements in the control regions of various genes and promotes their expression (2Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4550) Google Scholar). The generation of mice deficient for each Rel protein has revealed that the individual NF-κB family members have distinct, non-redundant functions. Furthermore, the separate combinations of NF-κB dimers recognize distinctive variants of the κB DNA binding site (3Kunsch C. Rosen C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6137-6146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kunsch C. Ruben S.M. Rosen C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4412-4421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This modulatory design therefore contributes to the differential patterns of target gene expression induced by the NF-κB family of proteins. Classic NF-κB is considered to be a heterodimer of RelA and p50 that is efficiently complexed by IκB proteins and is thereby highly inducible by stimulation with agents such as TNFα, which transduce signals via the IKK complex. The importance of RelA is highlighted by the fact that it supports the expression of a wide variety of genes that include various leukocyte adhesion molecules, chemokines, effector enzymes, and certain IκB and NF-κB members (5Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3389) Google Scholar, 6Bren G.D. Solan N.J. Miyoshi H. Pennington K.N. Pobst L.J. Paya C.V. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7722-7733Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Due to this widespread action RelA has been demonstrated to be of exceptional importance for the anti-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory roles of NF-κB. In contrast to RelA and the other NF-κB family members, RelB has been demonstrated to act as both a positive promoter of NF-κB-dependent gene expression and a repressor of NF-κB activity (7Ruben S.M. Klement J.F. Coleman T.A. Maher M. Chen C.H. Rosen C.A. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 745-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 8Suhasini M. Pilz R.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7360-7369Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 9Bours V. Azarenko V. Dejardin E. Siebenlist U. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1699-1702PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, RelB is only weakly controlled by IκB proteins and is the major contributor toward the constitutive NF-κB activity observed in lymphoid cells (10Lernbecher T. Kistler B. Wirth T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4060-4069Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Another specific feature of RelB is its limited ability to form complexes with the other Rel proteins such that it is unable to homodimerize and only heterodimerizes with p50 and p52, but not with RelA or c-Rel (36Dobrzanzki P. Ryseck R.P. Bravo R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4608-4616Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Although only a few RelB target genes have been reported, its positive transcriptional role is clearly manifested in studies using RelB-deficient mice. These mice are not only deficient for a thymic medulla and a subset of dendritic cells, but they also display defects in the development of secondary lymphatic organs suggesting a crucial role of RelB for these developmental processes (12Weih F. Carrasco D. Durham S.K. Barton D.S. Rizzo C.A. Ryseck R.P. Lira S.A. Bravo R. Cell. 1995; 80: 331-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been demonstrated that RelB·p52 heterodimers function in an alternative NF-κB activation pathway that might play a central role in the phenotype of RelB-deficient mice. This pathway culminates in the regulated processing through the action of the IKK subunit IKKα of p100 to form p52, which then associates predominantly with RelB (13Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G. Greten F.R. Krahn G. Bonizzi G. Chen Y. Hu Y. Fong A. Sun S.C. Karin M. Science. 2001; 293: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar, 14Xiao G. Cvijic M.E. Fong A. Harhaj E.W. Uhlik M.T. Waterfield M. Sun S.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6805-6815Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). However, the phenotype of RelB–/– mice also indicates a repressive role for RelB. Thus, in RelB-deficient fibroblasts, the expression of various chemokines and cytokines is augmented and prolonged through a mechanism that is at least in part, dependent upon IKK-induced NF-κB activity. Furthermore, because the TNFα gene is active in RelB–/– but not in wild type fibroblasts, it has been suggested that RelB plays an epigenetic role in silencing the TNFα gene similar to the reported RelB-specific demethylation of the Igκ locus in B cells (15Xia Y. Pauza M.E. Feng L. Lo D. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 375-387PubMed Google Scholar, 16Xia Y. Chen S. Wang Y. Mackman N. Ku G. Lo D. Feng L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7688-7696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another example for the repressive function of RelB is its ability to impair the combined phorbolester and ionomycin-induced NF-κB activity in T cells (7Ruben S.M. Klement J.F. Coleman T.A. Maher M. Chen C.H. Rosen C.A. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 745-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported a signal-induced proteolysis of RelB in activated T cells, implying a necessity for removal of either the negative or the positive RelB function for a proper T cell activation response (17Marienfeld R. Berberich-Siebelt F. Berberich I. Denk A. Serfling E. Neumann M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 8142-8147Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In our current study we analyzed in greater detail the repressive effect of RelB on NF-κB activity. We found that RelB reduces NF-κB activity by directly influencing the activity of RelA and that the molecular mechanism underlying this negative effect was inhibition of DNA binding by RelA through its complex formation with RelB. Mapping of the interaction domains demonstrated that only the Rel homology domains (RHDs) are necessary for this interaction similar to all other NF-κB dimers (11Ryseck R.P. Novotny J. Bravo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3100-3109Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). More importantly, we were unable to detect binding of the RelA·RelB heterodimer to known κB sites raising the possibility that endogenous RelA·RelB complexes are unable to bind to DNA. We further observed that RelA·RelB heterodimers exist in lymphoid as well as in non-lymphoid cells and are not, at least in the non-lymphoid cells, controlled by IκBα or IκBβ. Because the relb gene itself is a target for NF-κB, the increase in RelB expression is paralleled by an increase in levels of RelA·RelB heterodimers. Finally, we show using murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) as a model system, that high levels of RelB protein lead to a drastic reduction in active RelA and that this reduction is due to an increase in the formation of RelA·RelB heterodimers. Antibodies and Expression Vectors—The following antibodies (Abs) were used for immunoblots, immunoprecipitations, and supershift-EMSA anti-RelB (C19, #sc-226X; Santa Cruz Biotechnology (SC), Santa Cruz, CA), anti-p65/RelA (SC; A, #sc-109X), anti-c-Rel (SC; N, #sc-70X), anti-p50/NF-κB1 (SC; NLS, #sc-114X), anti-52/NF-κB2 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., #06-413), anti-IκBα (SC; C-21, #sc-371), anti-IκBβ (SC; C-20, #sc-945), and anti-HA (SC, Y-11, #sc-805). Anti-FLAG and anti-FLAG-conjugated agarose beads (FLAG M2, #F3165 and #A1205) were purchased from Sigma. Normal rabbit IgG (#sc-2027) and the blocking peptides for the anti-RelA and anti-RelB antibodies (#sc-109P and #sc-226P, respectively) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. All FLAG-tagged RelB fragments were amplified by PCR using the murine RelB cDNA as a template. The amplified fragments were inserted in the EcoRI and EcoRV sites of the pFLAG-CMV2 vector (Sigma). The HA-RelA and the p50 expression vectors were cloned as previously described (18Zhong H. Voll R.E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). The κB-dependent firefly luciferase plasmid is described elsewhere (19May M.J. Marienfeld R.B. Ghosh S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45992-46000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and the Renilla luciferase is under control of the chicken β-actin promoter in the Renilla reporter construct used. Preparation of Lymphocytes, Cell Culture, and Reporter Gene Assays—Wild type murine embryonic fibroblasts and human Raji and Daudi B cells as well as human 293 HEK cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum. Human Jurkat T leukemic cells, murine 70Z/3 pre B cells, and murine EL-4 thymoma cells were cultured in RPMI medium containing 5% fetal calf serum. Murine splenocytes from Balb/c mice were prepared according to standard protocols. Thymocytes from wild type mice or mice with a tissue-specific constitutively active IKKβ transgene were prepared as previously described (20Voll R.E. Jimi E. Phillips R.J. Barber D.F. Rincon M. Hayday A.C. Flavell R.A. Ghosh S. Immunity. 2000; 13: 677-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Briefly, prepared thymocytes were disrupted by using a cell strainer (Falcon), and the resulting cells were pelleted, washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline then loaded onto a Ficoll gradient to remove dead cells and erythrocytes. In all cytokine stimulation experiments, recombinant hTNFα (R&D systems) was used at a concentration of 10 ng/ml. Transient transfections and luciferase assays were performed using the Fugen6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) and the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega), respectively, according to the manufacturer's protocols. All experiments were performed in parallel and repeated at least three times with similar results. In Vitro Transcription and Translation—For in vitro translation, 1 μg of the appropriate expression vector was mixed with 20 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate from the TnT–T7 Quick in vitro transcription and translation system (Promega) and 1 μl of 35S-labeled methionine. The reaction was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C, and successful expression of the proteins of interest was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, then exposures were made to x-ray film. Immunoblots, Immunoprecipitations, and DNA Binding Studies—For the preparation of whole cellular extracts 5 × 106 to 1 × 107 of lymphoid and non-lymphoid cells were pelleted, washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, then resuspended in 200 μl of TnT buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete protease inhibitor mixture, Roche Applied Science). The extracts were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Nuclear and cytoplasmic protein extracts were prepared (21Marienfeld R. Neumann M. Chuvpilo S. Escher C. Kneitz B. Avots A. Schimpl A. Serfling E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1601-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and immunoblot (IB) assays and immunoprecipitations (IPs) were performed as previously described (22Neumann M. Grieshammer T. Chuvpilo S. Kneitz B. Lohoff M. Schimpl A. Franza Jr., B.R. Serfling E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1991-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Briefly, for IP experiments samples were equalized to contain identical protein concentrations (between 500 and 1000 μg/sample) in the TnT buffer. Specific antibodies (2 μg per sample) or, as a control, non-immune serum were added, and the samples were incubated on ice for 1 h prior to the addition of 30 μl a 50% Protein-A-Sepharose slurry. The samples were then incubated an additional 4–12 h on a rotor, washed extensively with TnT lysis buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors, and then boiled in 25 μl of SDS-sample buffer. Immunocomplexes were separated using SDS-PAGE (8%), transferred to a PVDF membrane, and then blotted with the appropriate antibodies. EMSAs were also performed as previously described (21Marienfeld R. Neumann M. Chuvpilo S. Escher C. Kneitz B. Avots A. Schimpl A. Serfling E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1601-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) using either the palindromic κB site, which allows for RelB binding, or the κB site from the Igκ enhancer that favors RelA binding (13Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G. Greten F.R. Krahn G. Bonizzi G. Chen Y. Hu Y. Fong A. Sun S.C. Karin M. Science. 2001; 293: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar, 18Zhong H. Voll R.E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). For the supershift assays 1 μg of a specific antibody was added to each protein-DNA mixture after 10-min incubation on ice. The samples were incubated for an additional 10 min prior to loading onto the gels. RelB Exerts a Dual Role on NF-κB-dependent Gene Expression—RelB is the only member of the NF-κB/Rel family that both positively and negatively influences NF-κB-dependent gene expression. It is known that RelB promotes NF-κB-dependent gene expression when complexed with p50 or p52, but the molecular mechanisms that underlie its negative function remain unclear. To study this negative regulatory function in detail, we first cotransfected 293 HEK cells with a κB-dependent luciferase reporter construct in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of an expression vector encoding murine RelB then stimulated the cells with either TNFα or PMA for 4 h. As shown in Fig. 1A, overexpression of RelB dose-dependently reduced NF-κB-dependent gene expression to ∼50% of both the TNFα- and PMA-induced (upper and lower panels, respectively) activity. To determine whether this inhibition was due to possible interference with the function of other NF-κB proteins, we cotransfected 293 HEK cells with expression vectors for RelA, p50, or RelB, either alone or in combination. As expected, RelB did not induce NF-κB activity when transfected alone, whereas cotransfection with p50 led to a significant increase in activity over that induced by p50 alone (Fig. 1B, columns 5–7). Intriguingly however, RelB overexpression dose-dependently reduced RelA-mediated κB-dependent gene expression (Fig. 1B, columns 2–4). To ensure that this effect was not due to reduced levels of expressed RelA, we analyzed these samples by immunoblotting using antibodies specific for either the HA-tag (RelA) or the FLAG-tag (RelB). As shown in the inset (Fig. 1), the levels of overexpressed RelA remained constant in the presence of increasing amounts of RelB. Furthermore, the fact that coexpression of RelB and p50 significantly increased the NF-κB activity argues against the possibility that the reduced RelA activity is based on the sequestration of its complex partner p50 in non-binding RelB·p50 heterodimers. RelB Forms a Complex with RelA—Inhibition of RelA activity through interaction with other transcription factors, including glucocorticoid receptors, p53, or c-Myc has been previously described (23McKay L.I. Cidlowski J.A. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 435-459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Chapman N.R. Webster G.A. Gillespie P.J. Wilson B.J. Crouch D.H. Perkins N.D. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 459-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 25Ikeda A. Sun X. Li Y. Zhang Y. Eckner R. Doi T.S. Takahashi T. Obata Y. Yoshioka K. Yamamoto K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Whereas association with the glucocorticoid receptors maintains the DNA binding activity of RelA, it has been demonstrated that p53 hinders the ability of RelA to bind to DNA. To analyze the molecular mechanism through which RelB inhibits RelA activity, we performed an EMSA experiment using a radiolabeled κB-oligonucleotide together with in vitro translated versions of full-length RelB and the Rel homology domain (RHD) of RelA (RelAΔ313). We used this deletion mutant of RelA because the full-length protein binds poorly to the κB binding site due to an intramolecular interaction (18Zhong H. Voll R.E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). In addition, by employing this in vitro assay system we avoided additional binding of other, endogenous NF-κB complexes to the κB site. In our experiments, both proteins were in vitro translated separately then mixed together with the indicated relative amounts prior to incubation with the radiolabeled κB probe. As expected, RelB alone was unable to bind to DNA (Fig. 2A; lane 6), whereas the robust DNA binding activity of the homodimer of RelAΔ313 (RelAΔ313(2)) was dose-dependently reduced by the addition of RelB (lanes 2–5). Because addition of in vitro translated RelB protein reduced the DNA binding of RelAΔ313 but did not lead to binding of an additional, slower migrating band (Fig. 2A), we conclude that the RelA·RelB complex is unable to bind to the κB-oligonucleotide used in this assay. To determine whether this impaired DNA binding of RelA was due to complex formation with RelB, we transiently transfected 293 HEK cells with expression vectors encoding HA-tagged RelA or FLAG-tagged RelB either individually or in combination and performed immunoprecipitation (IP) analysis using whole cell extracts prepared from these cells. As shown in Fig. 2B, HA-tagged RelA was immunoprecipitated with the FLAG-specific antibody only in the presence of cotransfected FLAG-RelB (lane 4) demonstrating that RelA interacts with RelB to form a complex. We noticed a reduced protein concentration of both ectopic-expressed Rel proteins in this particular experiment, which is probably due to a mutual repression of the expression caused high amounts of plasmid DNA in the transfection. Using various RelA and RelB deletion mutants, we mapped the interaction domains responsible for RelA·RelB complex formation and found that the RHDs of both proteins are required for the association (Fig. 2C), hence, indicating that this interaction mechanism strongly resembles the classic heterodimerization between other Rel proteins. Overexpressed RelB Impairs TNFα-induced RelA Activity in Fibroblasts—Having established that complex formation with RelB blocks the DNA binding capacity of RelA in vitro, we wished to determine whether this mechanism regulates the activities of the endogenous proteins in vivo. We therefore established a stable RelB-overexpressing murine embryonic fibroblast cell line as a model system, and, as shown in Fig. 3A, the levels of RelA, p50, p52, and their precursors p100 and p105, respectively, remained unaltered in these cells compared with control cells. We therefore compared the κB-specific DNA binding activity in nuclear extracts from either control cells or the RelB-overexpressing cells that were either untreated or stimulated with TNFα for 20 and 60 min. EMSA analysis revealed that overexpression of RelB dramatically altered the basal (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 1 and 4) and TNFα-induced (lanes 2 and 3 versus lanes 5 and 6) κB-specific binding complexes. Thus, basal binding activity was very low in untreated control cells but increased strongly after stimulation with TNFα for 20 min (complex C1′) and decreased thereafter (Fig.3B, lanes 1–3). In contrast, in RelB-overexpressing cells we detected a strong constitutive κB-binding activity of multiple complexes that we designated as complexes C1, C2, and C3 (Fig. 3B, lane 4). Furthermore TNFα stimulation led to a slight increase in the binding activity of only complex C1, whereas the complexes C2 and C3 remained unaltered (Fig. 3B, lanes 5 and 6). To determine the composition of these distinct κB complexes, we used nuclear extracts from control and the RelB-overexpressing cells stimulated with TNFα for 20 min for supershift analysis employing antibodies specific for RelA, RelB, p50, and p52. As shown in Fig. 3C, antibodies specific for both p50 and RelA reduced binding of the complex C1′ in control cells extracts, whereas antibodies specific for RelB or p52 had no effect (Fig. 3C, lanes 1–5). In extracts from RelB-overexpressing cells we detected a partial reduction in complex C1 binding using antibodies for RelA and more strongly with antibodies specific for RelB, p50, and p52 (Fig. 3C, lanes 6–10). The RelB antibody also affected the binding of both complex C2 and C3. Furthermore, complex C2 binding was blocked by the p52 antibody. These findings led us to conclude that the strong inducible binding activity (complex C1′) in control cells consists of RelA·p50 heterodimers, whereas in RelB-overexpressing cells, complex C1 is comprised of a mixture of RelA·p50 and RelB·p50 heterodimers, and complex C2 represents a RelB·p52 heterodimer. Interestingly, complex C3 appears to represent a slower migrating RelB-containing complex, although we were unable to precisely identify any other proteins in this complex. Nevertheless, it seems unlikely that this represents a RelB homodimer, because RelB alone cannot bind to κB sites. Taken together, the studies described above reveal that RelB overexpression dramatically reduces the inducible binding activity of RelA through the formation of heterodimeric complexes. Efficient IκB Degradation and Nuclear Translocation of RelA in RelB-overexpressing Fibroblasts—Previous studies using fibroblasts from RelB-deficient mice implied that RelB might negatively regulate IKK activity in cells stimulated with LPS (16Xia Y. Chen S. Wang Y. Mackman N. Ku G. Lo D. Feng L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7688-7696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, the possibility remained that the reduction in RelA activity we observed occurs via inefficient degradation of IκB proteins due to reduced activity of the IKK complex. We therefore performed immunoblot analysis for IκB proteins using cytoplasmic extracts from control cells or RelB-overexpressing cells that were either left untreated or stimulated for 20 and 60 min with TNFα. As shown in Fig. 4A, we detected an effective inducible degradation of IκBα and IκBβ in the control as well as the RelB-overexpressing cells (compare lanes 1–3 with lanes 4–6). Moreover, although the basal protein levels of IκBα were comparable between control cells and RelB cells (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 4) we consistently observed that IκBα was not resynthesized as efficiently in RelB-overexpressing cells (compare lanes 3 and 6). In addition to IκB degradation, nuclear translocation of the Rel proteins is also critical for their transcriptional activity. Therefore, we performed immunoblot analysis for RelA using nuclear extracts from control and RelB-overexpressing cells. In control cells we detected a low basal level of nuclear RelA, which was increased following 20 min of TNFα stimulation and declined thereafter (Fig. 4B, lanes 1–3). The time course of this nuclear localization reflected the DNA-binding activity observed in Fig. 3B. Stable overexpression of RelB led to an increase in both the basal as well as the inducible levels of nuclear RelA (Fig. 4B, lanes 4–6). Not surprisingly, higher levels of nuclear RelB were detected in RelB cells in comparison to the control cells. In addition, we detected a slight increase of the nuclear localization induced by TNFα in both the control cells as well as the RelB-overexpressing cells (Fig. 4B, lower panel). The effective inducible degradation of IκBα and IκBβ (Fig. 4A) suggests that IKK activity induced by TNFα is unaffected by RelB overexpression; indeed, we did not detect significant reduction of inducible IKK activity by in vitro kinase assays (data not shown). In addition, the augmented nuclear translocation in RelA in response to TNFα seen in RelB cells also suggests that the mobilization of RelA is not affected by RelB overexpression. We therefore reasoned that, because RelB can associate with RelA (Fig. 2, B and C) and RelB overexpression inhibits RelA activity (Figs. 1 and 2C), this might occur through formation of RelA·RelB heterodimers. To investigate this possibility we performed immunoprecipitations from whole cell extracts of control and RelB-overexpressing cells using an antibody specific for RelA. As control, similar IP experiments were performed using non-immune serum to ensure the specificity of the interaction (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 4C, immunoblot analysis of the resulting immunoprecipitated material revealed that RelA·RelB heterodimers are present in both control cells and at substantially increased levels in RelB overexpressing cells (Fig. 4C). Note that the ectopic overexpressed RelB is FLAG-tagged and therefore migrates slower in the polyacrylamide gel (upper arrow). Characterization of RelA·RelB Heterodimers in Fibroblasts—The finding that endogenous RelA·RelB heterodimers exist in the control cell line albeit at low levels (Fig. 4C, lane 3), prompted us to perform a more detailed characterization of these complexes using the"

In Escherichia coli Dps, the family prototype, the DNA binding properties are thought to be associated with the presence of the lysine-containing N-terminal tail that extends from the protein surface into the solvent. The x-ray crystal structure of A. tumefaciens Dps shows that the positively charged N-terminal tail, which is 11 amino acids shorter than in the E. coli protein, is blocked onto the protein surface. This feature accounts for the lack of interaction with DNA. The intersubunit ferroxidase center characteristic of Dps proteins is conserved and confers to the A. tumefaciens protein a ferritin-like activity that manifests itself in the capacity to oxidize and incorporate iron in the internal cavity and to release it after reduction. In turn, sequestration of Fe(II) correlates with the capacity of A. tumefaciens Dps to reduce the production of hydroxyl radicals from H2O2 through Fenton chemistry. These data demonstrate conclusively that DNA protection from oxidative damage in vitro does not require formation of a Dps-DNA complex. In vivo, the hydroxyl radical scavenging activity of A. tumefaciens Dps may be envisaged to act in concert with catalase A to counteract the toxic effect of H2O2, the major component of the plant defense system when challenged by the bacterium.

Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a soil-borne Gram-negative α-protobacterium of the family Rhizobiaceae, is the causative agent for crown gall tumor disease in more than 90 families of dicotyledonous plants resulting in major agronomic losses. Pathogenicity is due to transfer of its tumor-inducing plasmid into plant cells, where the oncogene-containing T-DNA becomes integrated into the chromosomes. This transfer system has played important roles in plant biotechnology as well as in plant molecular biology (1Klee H. Horsch R. Rogers S. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1987; 38: 467-486Crossref Google Scholar, 2Zupan J. Zambrynski P. Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1997; 16: 279-295Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Recently, A. tumefaciens was shown to contain one circular and one linear chromosome in addition to the tumor-inducing plasmid (3Suzuki K. Iwata K. Yoshida K. DNA Res. 2001; 8: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and the complete genome sequence was determined (4Wood D.W. Setubal J.C. Kaul R. Monks D.E. Kitajima J.P. Okura V.K. Zhou Y.

Physical maps of the linear and circular chromosomal DNAs and a linkage map of the linear chromosomal DNA in A. tumefaciens MAFF301001 were constructed for further genome analysis (3Suzuki K. Iwata K. Yoshida K. DNA Res. 2001; 8: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Chromosomally coded virulence genes were mapped exclusively on the circular chromosome. Plant cells challenged with A. tumefaciens or other pathogenic microorganisms react by means of an oxidative burst that has H2O2 as a major component and aims at restricting the bacterial growth conditions. In turn, A. tumefaciens uses H2O2 as an intracellular and intercellular inducer for the catalase A (katA) gene expression. which serves to minimize the oxidative response of the infected plant cells by maintaining appropriate levels of catalase activity and H2O2 (5Xu X.Q. Li L.P. Pan S.Q. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 645-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 6Storz G. Imlay J.A. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). The protection strategy against oxidative and nutritional stress has been studied extensively in Escherichia coli (7Dukan S. Nyström T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26027-26032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). A key component is a nonspecific DNA-binding protein named Dps (DNA-binding proteins from starved cells) that protects DNA from cleavage caused by reactive oxygen species such as the hydroxyl radicals produced during oxidation of Fe(II) by H2O2 (8Martinez A. Kolter R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5188-5194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When first described, the protective action of Dps on DNA was attributed to physical association between the two macromolecules since complex formation essentially abolishes oxidative DNA cleavage both in vitro and in vivo (8Martinez A. Kolter R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5188-5194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Wolf S.G. Frenkiel D. Arad T. Finkel S.E. Kolter R. Minsky A. Nature. 1999; 400: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Most recently however, E. coli Dps was shown to possess iron and H2O2 detoxification capacity, and this novel property was proposed to act in concert with physical association to DNA to achieve its protection against oxidative assault (10Zhao G. Ceci P. Ilari A. Giangiacomo L. Laue T.M. Chiancone E. Chasteen N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27689-27696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The striking similarity of E. coli Dps with Listeria innocua ferritin, and in particular the presence of the unusual ferroxidase site first described in the latter protein, provide the structural basis for the ability to nullify the toxic combination of Fe(II) and H2O2 (12Yang X. Chiancone E. Stefanini S. Ilari A. Chasteen N.D. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 13Ilari A. Ceci P. Ferrari D. Rossi G.L. Chiancone E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37619-37623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). E. coli Dps and Listeria ferritin, like all members of the Dps family, are homo-polymers formed by 12 four-helix bundle subunits that assemble with 23 symmetry into a hollow shell whose cavity is about 90 Å in diameter (11Grant R.A. Filman D.J. Finkel S.E. Kolter R. Hogle J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 14Bozzi M. Mignogna G. Stefanini S. Barra D. Longhi C. Valenti P.

Biol. 2000; 7: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Relative to Listeria ferritin, many Dps sequences display an N-terminal extension of variable length that contains two or three positively charged lysine residues. In the E. coli protein, the family prototype, this N-terminal region extends from the four-helix bundle core into the solvent and is thought to play an important role in the stabilization of the complex with DNA (11Grant R.A. Filman D.J. Finkel S.E. Kolter R. Hogle J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). In keeping with this idea, Listeria ferritin (15Ilari A. Stefanini S. Chiancone E. Tsernoglou D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), Dlp-1 Dlp-2 from Bacillus anthracis (16Papinutto E. Dundon W.G. Pitulis N. Battistutta R. Montecucco C. Zanotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15093-15098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), HP-NAP from Helicobacter pylori (17Zanotti G. Papinutto E.

Biol. 2002; 323: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), which lack the N-terminal extension, do not bind to DNA. In contrast to the variability of the N terminus, the ferroxidase site is highly conserved. In fact, the iron ligands are part of the so-called “DNA-binding signature.” The Dps ferroxidase site is unusual in that it is not embedded in a four-helix bundle as is generally the case but is shared by 2-fold symmetry-related subunits providing the iron ligands. As mentioned above, this site was first described in Listeria ferritin, where it is involved in the iron oxidation/incorporation process (14Bozzi M. Mignogna G. Stefanini S. Barra D. Longhi C. Valenti P. Chiancone E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3259-3265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), which in turn is related to the iron and H2O2 detoxification properties of the protein (12Yang X. Chiancone E. Stefanini S. Ilari A. Chasteen N.D. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It is important to stress that the residues which coordinate the metal in the Listeria ferritin ferroxidase site have the same function in all the members of Dps family whose x-ray crystal structures have been solved so far, namely E. coli Dps (11Grant R.A. Filman D.J. Finkel S.E. Kolter R. Hogle J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), Dlp-1 Dlp-2 from B. anthracis (16Papinutto E. Dundon W.G. Pitulis N. Battistutta R. Montecucco C. Zanotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15093-15098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and HP-NAP from H. pylori (17Zanotti G. Papinutto E. Dundon W.G. Battistutta R. Seveso M. Del Giudice G. Rappuoli R. Montecucco C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Accordingly, these proteins are endowed with the ability to oxidize and incorporate Fe(II). In this report, we describe the cloning, x-ray crystal structure, and functional properties of A. tumefaciens Dps, encoded by the dps gene located on the circular chromosome of the bacterium. Two findings provide focus on the mechanism of DNA protection by Dps proteins. First, A. tumefaciens Dps does not bind DNA in vitro since the lysine-containing N-terminal extension, which is 11 amino acids shorter than in the E. coli protein, is not disordered but interacts with the four-helix bundle core. Second, A. tumefaciens Dps affords significant DNA protection against oxidative cleavage due to its capacity to bind iron and to inhibit hydroxyl radical formation. It follows that in vitro DNA protection against oxidative assault does not require formation of a Dps-DNA complex but rests on the iron binding/oxidation activity of the Dps proteins. This is the likely reason for conservation of the ferroxidase site. Bacterial Strains and Media—A. tumefaciens strain GV3101 was grown on LB liquid medium (10 g/liters tryptone, 5 g/liters yeast extract, 5 g/liters NaCl), and LB plates containing 25 μg/ml gentamicin (Sigma), and 50 μ/ml rifampicin at 28 °C. E. coli strain BL21DE3 was grown at 37 °C on LB liquid medium and LB plates containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Cloning of the A. tumefaciens dps Gene into the Expression Vector pet-11a—The dps gene was amplified by PCR from the A. tumefaciens GV3101 genome using primers AGR1 (5′-CAGGAGACACATATGAAGACGCACAAG-3′) and AGR2 (5′-GCTGTGTGGATCCTGTTGGAAATTC-3′). The restriction sites for NdeI and BamHI are underlined. Isolation of the A. tumefaciens genomic DNA was performed using the DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). The amplified fragment (505 bp) was digested with NdeI and BamHI, purified by the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen), and cloned subsequently into the expression vector pet-11a (Novagen) digested with NdeI and BamHI. This plasmid was introduced into E. coli BL21DE3 and sequenced by E. coli strain BL21DE3 dideoxy sequencing to confirm the presence of the correct gene. Expression and Purification of Dps—E. coli BL21DE3 cells harboring the recombinant plasmid were grown in 1 liter of liquid LB containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C to an optical density of 0.6 at 600 nm. After addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to induce the transcription of the dps gene, the culture was incubated further for 3–4 h. Cells were harvested (15,000 × g for 20 min) and suspended in 10 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl) and disrupted by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 45 min. The supernatant was precipitated using two ammonium sulfate cuts at 30 and 60% saturation (w/v). At 60%, Dps remained in solution after centrifugation (15,000 × g for 45 min); the supernatant was dialyzed overnight against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl and then loaded onto a DEAE cellulose column (DE52) equilibrated with the same buffer. Dps was eluted with 250 mm NaCl, pooled, and stored at -75 °C after controlling the purity of the preparation by Coomassie Blue staining of 15% SDS-PAGE gels. Protein Crystallization—Crystallization was achieved at 293 K by the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique. A 2-μl volume of the protein sample, equilibrated against 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH = 7.5, 200 mm NaCl at 7 mg/ml, was mixed with an equal amount of the reservoir solution containing 0.1 m HEPES at pH values between 7.0 and 7.8 and ethylene glycol in a range between 16 and 24% v/v. Crystals grew in 1 week to about 0.5 × 0.4 × 0.2 mm3. Data Collection and Processing—Data were collected as 1.0 oscillation frames using the MAR CCD detector on the x-ray beamline at ELETTRA, Basovizza (Trieste, Italy) at a wavelength of 1.2 Å. Data were collected at 100 K using 25% glycerol as cryoprotectant. The data analysis, performed with DENZO (18Ottwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38592) Google Scholar), indicates that the crystals are orthorhombic (P21212) with unit cell dimensions of a = 106, b = 90.349, c = 105.6 Å. The data were scaled using SCALEPACK (18Ottwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38592) Google Scholar) and had an Rsym = 5.3% and an χ2 = 0.97. The crystal contains six monomers/asymmetric unit, corresponding to half of the assembled molecule, with a VM = 2.15 Å3/Da and a solvent content of about 45%. Structure Solution and Refinement—The structure was solved by molecular replacement using as the search probe a polyalanine-truncated model of one-half of the E. coli Dps dodecamer (Protein Data Bank entry 1DPS). The rotational and translational searches, performed with the program AmoRe (19Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar) in the resolution range of 10–3.0 Å, produced a clear solution corresponding to a correlation coefficient between Fcalc and Fobs of 62.0 and to an Rfact of 46.2%. Refinement of the atomic coordinates and displacement parameters was carried out by the maximum likelihood method with the program REFMAC (20Murshudov G.N. Lebedev A. Vagin A. Wilson K.S. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). The refinement statistics are presented in Table I. Model building was performed using the program package XTALVIEW (21McRee D.E. Practical Protein Crystallography. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1993: 365-374Google Scholar). Water molecules were added to the model manually. The final model (a hexamer) includes 972 residues (162 residues/monomer), 740 water molecules, 6 Fe(III), 2 Tris (hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane molecules, and an ethylene glycol molecule. The final Rcrys at 1.45-Å resolution is 18%. The quality of the model was assessed by the program PROCHECK (22Laskowski R.A. McArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot contain 96.0% of non-glycine residues.

The iron incorporation kinetics was monitored spectrophotometrically at 310 nm and 25 °C on a Hewlett-Packard diode array spectrophotometer after the addition of five increments of 50 Fe(II)/dodecamer to Dps solutions (1 μm) in 50 mm MOPS, 1The abbreviations used are: MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; Dpr, Dps-like peroxide resistance. 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.8, equilibrated in air. The solutions were kept under continuous stirring during the course of the reaction. As a control, the rate of Fe(II) autoxidation was measured in parallel. After the incorporation of iron, the samples were subjected to gel electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions in 7.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels. The gels were stained for iron with potassium ferrocyanide and for protein with Coomassie Blue. Kinetics of Iron Release—The kinetics of iron release was measured on Dps loaded with 273 ± 40 iron atoms/dodecamer as assessed by means of the Fe(II) 2,2′-bipyridyl method (23Botwell T.H. Mallet B. Biochem. J. 1955; 59: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Sodium dithionite was used as reducing agent. Stock solutions of sodium dithionite (0.1 m) were prepared in 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.8, 200 mm NaCl under purified nitrogen gas. In the experiments, aliquots of the sodium dithionite stock solution were added by means of a gastight syringe to 1 μm Dps in the same buffer containing 4 mm 2-2′-bipyridyl. The time course of the reaction was monitored at 520 nm, the wavelength corresponding to the absorption maximum of the Fe(II)-bipyridyl complex using a Hewlett-Packard diode array spectrophotometer equipped with a thermostatted cell maintained at 25 °C. The data were fitted using the program MATLAB (The Math Works Inc., Natick, MA). Measurement of Catalase Activity—Oxygen production was measured polarographically with a Clark type O2 electrode (Ys Model 5300 YSI) at 25 °C both in the absence and in the presence of A. tumefaciens or E. coli Dps (1 μm) in the apo or in the 24 Fe(III)-containing form. The observed traces were analyzed with the software MATLAB. Gel Retardation Assay—Supercoiled pet-11a DNA (20 nm) was incubated with 5 μmA. tumefaciens or E. coli Dps in 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.5) for 30 min at room temperature in the presence or absence of 200 mm NaCl or 100 mm MgCl2. The complexes were resolved on 1% agarose gel run in TAE buffer (0.04 m Tris acetate and 0.002 m EDTA). The gels were stained with ethidium bromide and imaged by ImageMaster VDS (Amersham Biosciences). DNA Protection Assay—DNA protection from oxidative damage was assessed in vitro using pet-11a plasmid DNA (5600 bp, 20 nm), purified by a Qiaprep spin plasmid miniprep kit (Qiagen). The total reaction volume was 15 μl in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 0.2 m NaCl. Plasmid DNA was allowed to interact with A. tumefaciens or E. coli Dps (5 μm) for 10 min prior to the introduction of FeSO4 (50 μm) and H2O2 (10 mm). The reaction mixtures were incubated for 5 min at room temperature. The reactions were stopped by incubation with 2% SDS at 85 °C for 5 min. Plasmid DNA was resolved by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel in TAE buffer. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide and imaged by ImageMaster VDS. Protection against Hydroxyl Radical Formation—Iron-dependent hydroxyl radical formation was assayed as described by Halliwell and Gutteridge (24Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. FEBS Lett. 1981; 128: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar) and Yamamoto et al. (25Yamamoto Y. Poole L.B. Hantgan R.R. Kamio Y. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2931-2939Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Fe(II) salts in solution generate hydroxyl radicals that degrade deoxyribose to a malondialdehyde-like compound that forms a chromogen with thiobarbituric acid. Fluorescence of the chromogen was used as the assay for hydroxyl radical formation. The reaction mixture contained the following reagents in a total volume of 1.2 ml at the final concentration stated: potassium phosphate buffer (10 mm, pH 7.4), NaCl (63 mm), deoxyribose (1 mm). Variable amounts of E. coli or A. tumefaciens Dps were added to the basal reaction mixture. The reaction was initiated by adding ferrous ammonium sulfate (21 μm), and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Thereafter, thiobarbituric acid (1 ml at 1% w/v) plus trichloroacetic acid (1 ml at 2.8% w/v) were added. The whole was heated at 100 °C for 10 min, cooled, and the chromogen was measured by fluorescence emission at 553 nm (λex 532 nm) using a Fluoromax fluorimeter (Spex Industry). Expression and Purification of Dps—Using the amino acid sequence of E. coli Dps (P27430), a search of the available A. tumefaciens genome (www.expasy.org) revealed the presence of one Dps-like gene designated dps that encodes for a 162-aminoacid sequence (Fig. 1A). The pI and Mr values, predicted using the ProtParam program, are 5.57 and 17,823 Da, respectively, as compared with 5.78 and 18,564 Da that pertain to E. coli Dps. Oligonucleotides were designed based on the available nucleotide sequence. The dps gene was amplified by PCR, cloned into the expression vector pet-11a, and transformed into E. coli BL21DE3. The protein was purified to homogeneity using the two-step purification protocol described under “Experimental Procedures.” Monomer Fold and Dodecameric Assembly—The A. tumefaciens Dps monomer folds in the four-helix bundle typical of Dps proteins and ferritins. The four helices, A to D, are packed by hydrophobic interactions; helices B and C are connected by a long loop containing a short α-helix (BC). Twelve identical subunits assemble to form a hollow protein shell with 23 symmetry and an external diameter of 90 Å (Fig. 1B). Fig. 1, B and C, shows a comparison of the A. tumefaciens Dps monomer with those of E. coli Dps and L. innocua ferritin, respectively. A similar comparison with the monomers of Dlp-1, Dlp-2 from B. anthracis, and HP-NAP from H. pylori is given in Fig. 1D. The superposition of these structures yields root mean square deviations of the Cα positions ranging from 1.2 to 1.5 Å for A. tumefaciens Dps relative to L. innocua ferritin, Dlp-1, Dlp-2, and HP-NAP, whereas the superposition between A. tumefaciens Dps and E. coli Dps results in a lower root mean square deviation, namely 0.822 Å (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 shows that the only significant differences are in the N- and C-terminal regions. Thus, the first 13–16 residues of A. tumefaciens Dps, which form an extension containing 3 Lys residues, are missing in the Dlp-1, Dlp-2, HP-NAP, and L. innocua monomers. In E. coli Dps, this extension is 11 residues longer than in the Agrobacterium protein; it is flexible (the first 9 amino acids are not visible in the x-ray crystal structure) and believed to protrude from the dodecamer and to be available for DNA binding. Surprisingly, in the A. tumefaciens Dps structure, the N-terminal extension is fully visible in the x-ray crystal structure as it interacts with the C terminus and with the C helix of the 3-fold symmetry-related subunit (Fig. 2). Hydrogen-bonding interactions are established by Gly77 through the backbone carbonyl group to Thr3 and by Lys5 through the backbone carbonyl to NE2 of Gln159, whereas Lys7 is hydrogen-bonded through the carbonyl oxygen to ND2 of Asn119 and through the backbone nitrogen to OE1 of Glu155. In addition, OD1 of Asp9 forms a salt bridge with NE of Arg122. In the structural alignment presented in Fig. 1A, the residues forming the so-called DNA binding signature are evidenced (in red). These residues comprise, as mentioned above, the iron ligands in the intersubunit ferroxidase site, namely His40, His52, Asp56, Glu71, Asp67, and other residues that are likely to determine the correct fold of the iron binding site such as Trp41, Gly45, placed on the AB loop near His40, and Gly77 on the first part of the CD loop near Glu71. It follows that DNA binding signature is a misnomer. A last set of residues, such as Asp133 and Asp138 (Fig. 1A, green), are at the outer rim of the hydrophilic channels along the 3-fold axes and provide the major contribution to the strongly negative electrostatic surface potential that surrounds the channels themselves to permit iron entry into the protein. Although the external electrostatic surface potential is strongly negative, positive patches like that formed by Arg112, Lys92, and Lys94 can be distinguished. They may have a role in the interaction with as yet unidentified molecular targets. As in all Dps proteins, the inner surface is strongly negative (data not shown) and is involved in the formation of the iron core. Structural Features of the Ferroxidase Center—The Fobs - Fcalc difference Fourier map, calculated before the introduction of the water molecules, shows a strong peak for each monomer with a value of 8 σ placed at the interface between the 2-fold symmetry-related subunits. The peaks have been assigned to an iron ion because the peak intensity is about three times stronger than that of water molecules and because x-ray fluorescence spectra measured at ELETTRA indicated that iron atoms are present in the crystals (data not shown). If one assumes an occupancy of 0.5, the iron ions refinement gives a reasonable thermal parameter of 27 Å2. The iron atom has a tetrahedral coordination sphere where two ligands are Asp67 and Glu71 of one subunit, which binds iron with side chain oxygen atoms. A third ligand is His40 of the 2-fold symmetry-related subunit, which binds iron with the side chain nitrogen atom (NE1), and the fourth ligand is a water molecule placed at about 3 Å from the iron ion and hydrogen-bonded to His52. This iron binding site therefore closely resembles the ferroxidase site identified in the L. innocua dodecameric ferritin (12Yang X. Chiancone E. Stefanini S. Ilari A. Chasteen N.D. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) that is shared by all members of the Dps family. Since the A. tumefaciens Dps iron binding site is not fully occupied by the metal, the x-ray structure furnishes the unique opportunity to visualize local conformational changes induced by iron binding. Thus, two distinct conformations for the Asp67 side chain are apparent in the 2Fobs - Fcalc electron density map (Fig. 3). When the site is empty, Asp67 assumes a rotameric conformation that allows formation of a salt bridge with Lys37 rather than coordination of the iron. Iron Incorporation and Release—In accordance with the presence of the ferroxidase site, A. tumefaciens Dps is able to oxidize and incorporate iron. This is indicated by electrophoretic analysis of the products obtained upon incubation with ferrous iron in the presence of molecular oxygen in 50 mm MOPS, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.8 (data not shown). A progress curve of iron uptake by A. tumefaciens Dps is shown in Fig. 4A; the half-time observed upon addition of 100 Fe/molecule corresponds to 27.7 s. Similar values were obtained with E. coli Dps under the same experimental conditions (data not shown). As for Listeria ferritin (12Yang X. Chiancone E. Stefanini S. Ilari A. Chasteen N.D. Biochem.

https://openalex.org/W2081500012,"Deregulation of the c-Myc oncoprotein (Myc) is implicated in many types of cancer. Myc is a sequence-specific transcription factor that regulates transcription of genes involved in the control of cell proliferation and apoptosis via mechanisms that are still poorly understood. Cell transformation by Myc involves its association with the transformation-transactivation domain-associated protein (TRRAP) and the human histone acetyltransferase (HAT) GCN5. TRRAP and GCN5 are components of a variety of shared and distinct multiprotein HAT complexes with diverse functions. Myc induces TRRAP recruitment and histone hyperacetylation at specific Myc-activated genes in vivo. However, the identity of the HAT complexes recruited by Myc and the roles of TRRAP and GCN5 in Myc function are still unclear. Here we show that Myc co-recruits TRRAP and GCN5 via direct physical interactions of its N-terminal activation/transformation domain with the human STAGA (SPT3-TAF-GCN5 acetylase) coactivator complex. We demonstrate that GCN5 and TRRAP cooperate to enhance transcription activation by the N-terminal activation domain of Myc in vivo and that this synergy requires both the SPT3/GCN5 interaction domain of TRRAP and the HAT activity of GCN5. Thus, TRRAP might function as an adaptor within the STAGA complex, which helps recruit GCN5 HAT activity to Myc during transcription activation."

All sexually reproducing organisms have a specialized developmental pathway for gametogenesis, in which diploid cells undergo meiosis to produce haploid germ cells. In plant male gametogenesis, archesporial cells differentiate into pollen mother cells (PMCs), 1The abbreviations used are: PMC, pollen mother cell; UAS, upstream activating sequence; 5′-RACE, 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CaMV, cauliflower mosaic virus; NLS, nuclear localization signal; BR, basic region; DB, DNA-binding domain; AD, activation domain; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription. 1The abbreviations used are: PMC, pollen mother cell; UAS, upstream activating sequence; 5′-RACE, 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CaMV, cauliflower mosaic virus; NLS, nuclear localization signal; BR, basic region; DB, DNA-binding domain; AD, activation domain; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription. and the PMCs give rise to the productions of tetrads of four haploid germ cells with two nuclear divisions. Subsequently, the haploid germ cells develop into mature pollen through the cytological and molecular events involved in the pollen developmental pathway. Meiosis organizes the transition from diploid to haploid and thus is one of the most complex events to occur during gametogenesis. The complexity of events suggests that many genes are tightly regulated to ensure each successful meiotic division. In yeast, characterization of temporal and spatial gene expression at meiosis has contributed toward a greater understanding of the mechanism of the meiotic gene (1Chu S. DeRisi J. Eisen M. Mulholland J. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Herskowitz I. Science. 1998; 282: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotes, however, only a limited number of meiotic genes have been reported because of the lack of appropriate analytical techniques. The monocotyledonous plant Lilium longiflorum has been used for decades to study meiosis because of the accessibility of the male gametophyte (microsporocytes and pollen grains) and the synchronous development among sporogenous cells within an anther (2Erickson R.O. Am. J. Bot. 1948; 35: 729-739Crossref Google Scholar, 3Hotta Y. Tabata S. Stubbs L. Stern H. Cell. 1985; 40: 785-793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). By using the subtractive method, Kobayashi et al. (4Kobayashi T. Kobayashi E. Sato S. Hotta Y. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1994; 1: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) isolated 18 cDNAs (LIM1–LIM18 genes), which are preferentially expressed during the premeiotic phase of microsporogenesis in L. longiflorum. LIM15 gene, which shows a similarity to the DNA recombination gene RecA, has been shown to be involved in meiosis in plants (5Terasawa M. Shinohara A. Hotta Y. Ogawa H. Ogawa T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 925-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 6Couteau F. Belzile F. Horlow C. Grandjean O. Vezon D. Doutriaux M.-P. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1623-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). These results suggest that genes induced at meiosis have a function associated with meiotic events. However, mechanisms involved in meiosis-specific gene expression are not necessarily clear, and factors that regulate gene expression specific to microsporogenesis have not been identified yet. In the view of gene expression at microsporogenesis, identification of the factors that regulate specific gene expression should provide important clues to elucidate mechanisms involved in meiotic events in higher plants. In an attempt to obtain information for genes expressed during microsporogenesis and meiosis, we previously carried out a large scale sequencing project using a lily zygotene cDNA library (7Morohashi K. Takase H. Hotta Y. Hiratsuka K. Plant Biotechnol. 2000; 17: 131-135Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). One of the sequenced clones, M1125, has homology with a plant-specific putative transcription factor, Scarecrow (SCR). SCR is required for asymmetric cell division in an Arabidopsis root and encodes a novel putative transcription factor (8Di Laurenzio L. Wysocka-Diller J. Malamy J.E. Pysh L. Helariutta Y. Freshour G. Hahn M.G. Feldmann K.A. Benfey P.N. Cell. 1996; 86: 423-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). Recently, SCR-like genes were reported in various plant species such as maize and pea (9Lim J. Helariutta Y. Specht C.D. Jung J. Sims L. Bruce W.B. Diehn S. Benfey P.N. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1307-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 10Sassa N. Matsushita Y. Nakamura T. Nyunoya H. Plant Cell Physiol. 2001; 42: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). SCR-like gene functions are not restricted to the asymmetric cell division. Although Repressor of Ga1–3 (RGA) and gibberellin-insensitive (GAI) genes show a similarity to SCR in their amino acid sequences, they play important roles in the gibberellin signal transduction of Arabidopsis but not in asymmetric cell division (11Silverstone A.L. Ciampaglio C.N. Sun T.-P. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 12Peng J.P. Carol P. Richards D.E. King K.E. Cowling R.J. Murphy G.P. Harberd N.P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3194-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). In addition, PAT1 protein, which shows a similarity to SCR protein, has been shown to be involved in the phytochrome A signal transduction of Arabidopsis (13Bolle C. Konez C. Chua N.-H. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1269-1278PubMed Google Scholar). In other species, various functions of SCR-like genes were reported; the Lateral suppressor (Ls) gene in tomato has crucial functions in the formation of lateral branches, and SLR1 of rice has been identified as an ortholog of GAI (14Schumacher K. Schmitt T. Rossberg M. Schmitz G. Theres K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 290-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 15Ikeda A. Ueguchi-Tanaka M. Sonoda Y. Kitano H. Koshioka M.

Benfey P.N. Plant J. 1999; 18: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) identified a number of Arabidopsis ESTs (expressed sequence tags) that showed a similarity to SCR amino acid sequence and designated them Scarecrow-like (SCL). They indicated that SCL genes comprised a novel gene family, referred to as the GRAS gene family. The GRAS gene products have conserved carboxyl termini, but the amino termini are structurally diverse. It has been suggested that the diversity of amino termini would be related to their functions, but no detailed studies on functional analysis have been carried out. Although the SCR product is predicted to be a transcriptional regulator on the basis of structural similarities to transcriptional regulatory proteins (8Di Laurenzio L. Wysocka-Diller J. Malamy J.E.

Cell. 1996; 86: 423-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar), direct evidence for the GRAS gene product as a transcriptional regulator has not been reported. It was shown that chimeric SLR1/OsGAI proteins fused to the yeast GAL4 DNA-binding domain enhanced UAS promoter activity (17Ogawa M. Kusano T. Katsumi M. Sano H. Gene. 2000; 245: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 18Itoh H. Ueguchi-Tanaka M. Sato Y. Ashikari M. Matsuoka M. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), but the target sequence for the GRAS protein has not been reported. Here, we describe the isolation and characterization of a novel GRAS gene from lily microsporocytes and show that the GRAS gene product is able to activate the transcription of meiosis-associated gene by transient expression assay. Plant Materials—Flower buds of L. longiflorum cv. Hinomoto were categorized according to their length, which was calculated from the base of the pedicel to the tip of the sepals (ranging from 10 to 35 mm). Estimation of the stages of the microsporogenesis was based on the correlation between bud length and the determination of meiotic stage by cytological examination according to published methods (2Erickson R.O. Am. J. Bot. 1948; 35: 729-739Crossref Google Scholar). Anthers were isolated from the dissected buds. Leaves were collected from fresh lilies. All materials were soaked in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. DNA Sequencing—DNA sequencing was performed using a Perkin-Elmer dye primer cycle system according to the manufacturer's instructions with a ABI 373 Stretch sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc.). Homology searches were performed in the GenBankTM data base using the BLAST program (19Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68368) Google Scholar). RNA Isolation and Gel Blot Analysis—RNA was prepared from samples kept at -80 °C using the aurintricarboxylic acid method as described previously (20Mousavi A. Hiratsuka R. Takase H. Hiratsuka K. Hotta Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 406-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Each lane was loaded with 10 μg of total RNA, which was then fractionated on 1% agarose-formaldehyde gels and blotted onto Hybond N+ membrane according to the manufacture's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization of 32P-labeled DNA probes to RNA blots was performed in 50% formamide, 5% SDS, and 5× SSC. The filters were prehybridized for 2 h and hybridized overnight at 42 °C. The RNA blots were washed for 20 min in 2× SSC, 1% SDS at 42, 50, and 60 °C, briefly air-dried, and then autoradiographed with X-AR films (Fuji film). 5′-Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (5′-RACE)—Total RNA was extracted from buds at the pachytene stage of lily PMCs by using an RNeasy Plant kit (Qiagen), and treated with RNase-free DNase (Amersham Biosciences). 5′-RACE was performed with the 5′-RACE system for Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends kit (Invitrogen) using the following primers: 1125GSP1, 5′-GACGGTCATCTATAGC-3′; 1125A, 5′-TAGCCACTGTTTGGGCACAATGG-3′; and 1125B, 5′-GAGTTCTAAGGTCCACCACCTCAG-3′. Reporter Gene Constructions and Transient Expression of the GFP-LlSCL Fusion Protein in Onion Epidermal Cells—For green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions, the β-glucuronidase coding region from pBI221 was replaced by the GFP coding region of plasmid pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). DNA fragments coding for the entire or partial regions of LlSCL were amplified using the following primers with KOD-plus polymerase (Toyobo): pGLlSCL-N, LlSCL-NE (5′-GGGAATTCGGTGAAAGAGCTAAAAGTAG-3′), and LlSCL-NC (5′-CCCTCGAGTGGACAGAGCAGAACAAGATC-3′) (linker site is underlined); pGLlSCL-C, LlSCL-C′ (5′-GGAGATCTGCAACCAGAAGTCCTCAGAATGG-3′), and 1125-C (5′-GGCTCGAGTCATCGACTATTGGGTG); pGLlSCL-CdL, LlSCL-CdL (5′-GGAGATCTGCCTACGGGCTCTATATGTCGG-3′), and 1125-C; pGLlSCL-CdV, LlSCL-CdV (5′-CCAGATCTCCACAGCCAGGTTTCCGCCC-3′), and 1125-C; pGLlSCL-CdBII, LlSCL-C′, and 1125-SQ4 (5′-ATAACATTCATAGCATCCCGCCCG-3′). These PCR DNAs were digested with the appropriate enzymes and cloned into pBI221-GFP vectors. All GFP-LlSCL fusion derivatives (pGLlSCL-N, pGLlSCL-C, pGLlSCL-CdL, pGLlSCL-CdV, and pGLlSCL-CdBII) encode fusion proteins with GFP at the amino-terminal portion and with LlSCL at the carboxyl-terminal portion. Onion epidermal cells were prepared and bombarded with 1.6 μm gold particles (Bio-Rad PDS-1000/He) coated with the control plasmid DNA. Samples were kept at room temperature for 8 h, and the GFP localization was visualized using a fluorescent microscope E800 (Nikon) equipped with a color charge-coupled device camera system (CCD, Hamamatsu Photonics). Transcriptional Activation Experiments in Plant Cells—For transcriptional activation through the GAL4 target sequence, we used the firefly luciferase gene reporter plasmid containing six copies of the GAL4 target sequence fused to the -46 region of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter. For the construction of the effector plasmids, the PCR-amplified LlSCL fragments were fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and inserted into the pBI221 vector by replacing the β-glucuronidase coding sequence: p221DBLlSCL-FL, LlSCL-5′Bam (5′-GGGGATCCATGGTGAAAGAGCTAAAAGTAGACG-3′), and 1125-C (linker site is underlined); p221DBLlSCL-N, LlSCL-5′Bam and LlSCL-N/STOP (5′-CCCTCGAGCTATGGACAGAGCAGAACAAGATC-3′); p221DBLlSCL-C, LlSCL-C′Met (5′-GGGGATCCATGGCAACCAGAAGTCCTCAGAATGG-3′), and 1125-C; p221DBLlSCL-CdL, LlSCL-CdL, and 1125-C; p221DBLlSCL-CdV, LlSCL-CdV and 1125-C; p221DBLlSCL-N(1–129), LlSCL-5′Bam, and LlSCL587-STP (5′-GGCTCGAGCTAAGATGGCTGGTCAGATGGAG-3′); p221DBLlSCL-N(130–202), LlSCL587-Met (5′-GGGGATCCATGTACAACAATCCTAGTCCGG-3′), and LlSCL806-STP (5′-CCCTCGAGCTATGTGGGCTCTCCCAATCCTTC-3′); p221DBLlSCL-N(203–317), LlSCL806-Met (5′-GGGGATCCATGACTAACATTGAAGCTCGTG-3′), and LlSCL-N/STOP; p221DBLlSCL-N(1–202), LlSCL-5′Bam, and LlSCL806-STP; p221DBLlSCL-N(130–317), LlSCL587-Met, and LlSCL-N/STOP. The yeast GAL4 activation domain was amplified from pGADT7 (Clontech) with the following primers: AD5-Bg (5′-GGAGATCTGCCAATTTTAATCAAAGTGGG-3′) and AD3-Xh (5′-GGCTCGAGCTACTCTTTTTTTGGGTTTGGTGGGG-3′). These PCR-amplified DNAs were digested with appropriate enzymes and cloned into the pBI221-GAL4DB vector containing a GAL4 DNA-binding domain. For the transactivation assay of LlSCL protein in plant cells, the LlSCL-FL fragment was amplified with LlSCL-5′Bam and 1125-C primers and then inserted into SacI-blunt/BamHI-digested pBI221 by replacing the β-glucuronidase coding sequence. A reporter plasmid harboring a tissue-specific promoter, pLIM10prom::221::LUC+, was constructed as described previously (21Uefuji H. Minami M. Takase H. Hiratsuka K. Plant Biotechnol. 2001; 18: 151-156Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). 2H. Takase, M. Minami, Y. Hotta, and K. Hiratsuka, unpublished. The BY-2 cells, the lily leaves, and PMCs were incubated at room temperature for 12 and 24 h in the dark, respectively. Dual luciferase assay was conducted as described previously (22Matsuo N. Minami M. Maeda T. Hiratsuka K. Plant Biotechnol. 2001; 18: 71-75Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Yeast Expression Vectors, Transformation, and β-Galactosidase Assay—To construct a yeast expression vector, the PCR-amplified LlSCL fragments and yeast activation domain were inserted into the pGBKT7 vector (Clontech). Constructs used in this experiments were pGB, pGBAD, pGBLlSCL-N, pGBLlSCL-N(1–129), pGBLlSCL-N(130–202), pGBLlSCL-N(203–317), pGBLlSCL-N(1–202), and pGBLlSCL-N(130–317). Transformation of budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was carried out by the lithium acetate method. The strain used was AH109 (MATa, trp1–901, leu2–3, 112, ura3–52, his3–200, gal4Δ, gal80Δ, LYS2::GAL1UAS-GAL1TATA-HIS3, GAL2UAS-GAL2TATA-ADE2, URA3::MEL1UAS-MEL1TATA-lacZ, MEL1). The β-galactosidase liquid assay was performed with a luminescent β-galactosidase detection kit II according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). Isolation of a GRAS Gene cDNA from Lily Microsporocytes—We have selected and sequenced ∼400 cDNA clones from a cDNA library of lily PMCs by the self-hybridization method as described previously (7Morohashi K. Takase H. Hotta Y. Hiratsuka K. Plant Biotechnol. 2000; 17: 131-135Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). One of these cDNA clones, designated M1125, is closely related in amino acid sequence to the SCR gene, which encodes a putative transcription factor that regulates an asymmetric cell division in the Arabidopsis root (8Di Laurenzio L. Wysocka-Diller J. Malamy J.E. Pysh L. Helariutta Y. Freshour G. Hahn M.G. Feldmann K.A. Benfey P.N. Cell. 1996; 86: 423-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). By using the 5′-RACE technique, we isolated a 2.6-kb full-length cDNA of the M1125 from the total RNA at the pachytene stage of lily PMCs. The full-length cDNA contains an open reading frame with a coding capacity for 740 amino acids (Fig. 1). Comparison of the 740-amino acid sequence with the previously described proteins showed a similarity to the GAI, RGA, and SCR proteins belonging to the GRAS protein family. Comparison of the M1125 protein, designated LlSCL (Lilium longiflorum SCARECROW-Like), with other GRAS gene products revealed the presence of highly conserved VHIID, PFYRE, and SAW motifs within the carboxyl terminus of the protein (Fig. 2). Two leucine heptad repeats, referred to as LHRI and LHRII, are also identified in the carboxyl terminus (amino acids 369–413 and 537–603, respectively). In the middle (amino acids 365–369) of the LlSCL protein, the LXXLL motif, which has been shown to mediate the binding of transcriptional coactivators to nuclear receptors (23Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar, 24Leo C. Chen J.D. Gene. 2000; 245: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), was also identified. Although no typical nuclear localization signal (NLS) was found within the LlSCL amino acid sequence, two parts of the highly basic region, referred to as BRI and BRII, were identified (amino acids 351–359 and 697–704, respectively). The amino terminus of the LlSCL protein does not show any significant homology to known proteins (Fig. 1).Fig. 2Comparison of LlSCL with GRAS gene family. Gaps have been introduced to maximize the alignment, and identical and similar amino acids are highlighted in black and gray boxes, respectively. The VHIID domain is indicated by a bold underline. The double underline shows leucine heptad repeats, and asterisks identify residues that define leucine heptad repeats. Conserved residues of the PFRYE motif and the SAW motif are indicated by open and closed circles, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) LlSCL Gene Is Strongly Expressed at the Premeiotic Phase—To characterize the expression pattern of the LlSCL gene, we conducted RNA gel blot analysis. Fig. 2 shows the results obtained by probing a blot of total RNA prepared from whole anthers collected at various stages of anther development with the radiolabeled 5′-region of the LlSCL gene. A 2.6-kb LlSCL transcript was found to be differentially regulated during the course of microsporogenesis. The maximal level of LlSCL mRNA was detected in anthers containing sporogenous cells before meiosis. During the meiosis of microsporogenesis, the transcript was detected in a slightly lower level throughout microspore development, and then it decreased to an undetectable level in mature pollen (Fig. 3). In vegetative tissues, LlSCL gene expression levels were barely detectable (data not shown). Nuclear Localization of LlSCL Protein—SCR and related proteins have been suggested to be involved in the transcriptional regulation (8Di Laurenzio L. Wysocka-Diller J. Malamy J.E. Pysh L. Helariutta Y. Freshour G. Hahn M.G. Feldmann K.A. Benfey P.N. Cell. 1996; 86: 423-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). Thus, they are thought to have nuclear localizing activity. In fact, a previous report indicated that RGA-GFP fusion proteins are located in the nucleus of the onion epidermal cell (11Silverstone A.L. Ciampaglio C.N. Sun T.-P. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). To investigate the intracellular localization of LlSCL protein, chimeric genes encoding the LlSCL protein fused to the GFP were introduced into onion epidermal cells using a particle bombardment system and expressed under control of the CaMV 35S promoter (Fig. 4). Eight hours after bombardment, green fluorescence derived from GFP fusion proteins were examined by fluorescent microscopy. The fluorescent signals derived from the control plasmid vector expressing GFP alone were observed in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of onion epidermal cells (Fig. 5A). Likewise, the GFP signals from cells transfected with pGLlSCL-CdV and pGLlSCL-CdL constructs were preferentially observed in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5, D and E, respectively). The GFP-LlSCL-N fusion proteins strongly aggregated in cytoplasm (Fig. 5G). Although GFP signals of the pGLlSCL-CdBI construct were observed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, the signals in the nucleus were stronger than those in cytoplasm (Fig. 5C). On the contrary, the signals from the pGLlSCL-C were located exclusively in the nucleus (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, the signals from the construct pGLlSCL-CdBII were observed in the cytoplasm, even though the pGLlSCL-CdBII construct expressed a fusion protein including the BRI region (Fig. 5F). These results indicate that both BRI (amino acids 351–359) and BRII (amino acids 697–704) are important for the nuclear localization of LlSCL protein. It is necessary to confirm the requirement of basic regions in the context of full-length protein; however, we could not carry out a mutational analysis using full-length protein because of our inability to detect fluorescent signals from samples transfected with pGLlSCL-FL. The LlSCL Protein Contains a Transcriptional Activation Domain—To evaluate the function of the LlSCL protein as a transcription factor, we performed transcriptional activation experiments by transient assay in tobacco BY-2 cells. The reporter gene was the firefly (Photinus pyralis) luciferase gene preceded by a promoter containing six repeats of the GAL4 target sequence (UAS) fused to the CaMV 35S promoter TATA-box region. The effector genes were designed to express fusions of various parts of the LlSCL protein with the DNA-binding domain (DB) of yeast GAL4. The activation domain (AD) of yeast GAL4 protein was used as a positive control. The plasmid constructs used and the results are shown in Fig. 6. The full-size LlSCL protein fused to GAL4-DB, DB-FL, was able to raise the activation level the UAS promoter ∼2.5-fold higher than the activation level of GAL4-DB alone. However, three truncated LlSCL proteins, LlSCL-C, LlSCL-CdL, and LlSCL-CdV, fused to GAL4-DB did not activate the UAS promoter. On the other hand, the amino-terminal portion of the LlSCL protein fused to GAL4-DB strongly activated the UAS promoter. The transcriptional activation levels of GAL4-DB-LlSCL fusion protein derivatives containing the amino-terminal region were equivalent to the level of the GAL4-AD. These results suggest that the amino terminus of the LlSCL protein possesses the capability of strong transcriptional activation. The amino terminus of LlSCL protein has two acidic regions. The domain responsible for transcriptional activation often belongs to the sequence that is rich in acidic residues (25Giniger E. Ptashne M. Nature. 1987; 330: 670-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 26Triezenberg S.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Therefore, we dissected the amino-terminal region of LlSCL protein to investigate the activities of transcriptional activation with respect to these acidic regions. As shown in Fig. 7, DB-N(1–129), which includes the first acidic domain (amino acids 4–110), showed strong transcriptional activation equivalent to that of DB-N(1–317). The neutral domain fused to GAL4-DB, DB-N(130–202), had up to 3-fold higher activity than GAL4-DB alone. On the other hand, DB-N(203–317) and DB-N(130–317) showed no transcriptional activity, even though both constructs included the second acidic domain. Interestingly, the highest activity was obtained by the expression of DB-N(1–202) harboring the first acidic domain and the neutral domain. These results suggest that the region containing the first acidic domain and the neutral domain but not the second acidic domain of LlSCL protein is responsible for the transcriptional activation. The Amino Terminus of LlSCL Protein Functions as a Transcriptional Activator in Yeast Cells—To investigate whether the LlSCL protein activates transcription through a plant-specific mechanism, we also examined the activity of transcriptional activation of LlSCL protein in yeast cells. We constructed various plasmids expressing the GAL4 DNA-binding domain fusions of different regions of LlSCL protein in yeast. These plasmids were introduced into yeast cells carrying the lacZ reporter gene under the control of the GAL1 promoter. (Fig. 8). The results of the β-galactosidase assay indicated that the properties of transcription activation of LlSCL protein in yeast cells were the same as those in plant cells. The region covering the first acidic domain and the neutral domain of the amino terminus of LlSCL protein caused transcriptional activation in the yeast as well as in the plant cell. Interestingly, the transcriptional activation levels of the GAL4-DB fusion proteins containing the LlSCL acidic domain were higher than that of GAL4-DB-AD fusion in yeast cells. These results suggest that plant-specific factors are not required for the strong activity of transcriptional activation of LlSCL acidic domain. LlSCL Protein Is a Transcriptional Activator of the Meiosis-associated Gene in PMCs—To study whether the LlSCL gene functions as a transcriptional activator at microsporogenesis, we investigated the effect of the full-length LlSCL protein expression on the transcriptional activity of the meiosis-associated promoter that directs microsporogenesis-specific gene expression. We exploited a meiosis-associated gene, LIM10, which encodes a small molecular weight heat shock protein specifically induced at the meiotic prophase (zygotene) in lily PMCs. To measure the transcriptional activation of the meiosis-associated promoter, the firefly luciferase coding region was placed downstream of the LIM10 promoter sequence. 3M. Minami, H. Takase, and K. Hiratsuka, manuscript in preparation. The full-length LlSCL cDNA preceded by the CaMV 35S promoter was used as the effector gene. The activity of the CaMV 35S promoter was higher than the meiosis-associated promoter in tobacco BY-2 cells and lily leaves, whereas the higher activity of the meiosis-associated promoter was detected in lily PMCs (Fig. 9). When the LlSCL protein was co-expressed together with reporter genes, the activity of CaMV 35S promoter was slightly decreased in all plant cells tested. Similarly, the activity of the meiosis-associated promoter was slightly decreased by co-expression with LlSCL in tobacco BY-2 cells and lily leaves. In PMCs, the activity of the meiosis-associated promoter was enhanced by LlSCL co-expression, whereas the activity of CaMV 35S promoter was down-regulated (Fig. 9). These results suggest that the LlSCL protein plays a role in the transcriptional activation of the meiosis-associated (LIM10) promoter during meiosis in conjunction with PMC-specific factor(s). A Novel Gene Encoding a Nuclear GRAS Protein Is Expressed at Microsporogenesis—In this study, we isolated and characterized a novel GRAS gene, LlSCL (L. longiflorum Scarecrow-like), expressed specifically in premeiotic phase within the anthers of L. longiflorum. Because the SCR has been predicted to be a transcriptional regulator, we speculated that the LlSCL gene encodes a novel transcriptional regulator involved in microsporogenesis. The molecular dissection experiments indicated that both the first and second basic regions (BRI and BRII) of the LlSCL protein are important for the nuclear localization. Although the NLSs within plant transcription factors vary in sequence, organization, and number, it is noteworthy that the NLS of the LlSCL protein separates the two regions by 400 residues. This kind of distant NLSs has not been reported in previously described transcription factors including GRAS gene products (27Liu L. White M.J. MacRae T.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of the BRI domain of LlSCL protein shares homology with the basic region in the SCR protein, but domain identical to BRII of the LlSCL protein was not found in the SCR protein. In addition, no homology was found between the putative NLS of the RGA protein and BRI or BRII of LlSCL protein (11Silverstone A.L. Ciampaglio C.N. Sun T.-P. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the PAT1 protein has been shown to contain no putative NLS, and the protein is distributed throughout the cytoplasm (13Bolle C. Konez C. Chua N.-H. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1269-1278PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest the presence of various functions and mechanisms involving intracellular localization of GRAS gene products. Amino Terminus of LlSCL Protein Has a Strong Transcriptional Activity—Although the GRAS gene products share highly conserved motifs located within the carboxyl terminus, the amino termini were variable (16Pysh L.D. Wysocka-Diller J.W. Camilleri C. Bouchez D. Benfey P.N. Plant J. 1999; 18: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The variable structures of the amino termini of GRAS gene products would be related to their functions. In fact, the DELLA domain, which is positioned in the amino termini of the RGA, GAI, RGL1, and SLR1 proteins, is required for the specific functions of those proteins in the gibberellin response (11Silverstone A.L. Ciampaglio C.N. Sun T.-P. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 18Itoh H. Ueguchi-Tanaka M. Sato Y. Ashikari M. Matsuoka M. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 28Wen C.-K. Chang C. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). On the contrary, the SCR protein, which has a function distinct from other GRAS proteins, does not contain any DELLA domains in the amino terminus. The LlSCL protein does not contain any DELLA domains and shows no similarity to the amino terminus of SCR protein. Therefore, it is speculated that the LlSCL gene would have specific functions distinct from the gibberellin response and from asymmetric cell division in the root. Except for the DELLA domain, the molecular functions of the amino terminus of GRAS gene products have not been reported. In this study, however, we have demonstrated that the amino terminus of LlSCL protein (amino acids 1–317) is able to direct transcriptional activation equivalent to the level of the activation domain of yeast GAL4 protein. It is well known that hydrophobic residues interspersed between the acidic residues are associated with the transcriptional activation (26Triezenberg S.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the fact that the amino terminus of LlSCL (amino acids 1–317) is highly acidic with a net negative charge of 32. The amino terminus of LlSCL protein can be further divided into three domains: first acidic domain, neutral domain, and second acidic domain. Figs. 7 and 8 clearly indicate that both the first acidic and neutral domains, but not the second acidic domain, show strong activity. The transcriptional activation of both domains was observed not only in plant cells but also in yeast cells. This indicates that the mechanism of transcriptional activation by the amino terminus of LlSCL protein is evolutionarily conserved. Silverstone et al. (11Silverstone A.L. Ciampaglio C.N. Sun T.-P. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) proposed a model for gibberellin signal transduction through O-GlcNAc modification at serine/threonine-rich region(s) of GAI/RGA proteins. Because the LlSCL protein also contains serine stretches within the first acidic and neutral domains, it may be possible that the serine stretches could be O-GlcNAc modified by unknown factors in tobacco BY-2 cells and yeast cells, modulating the levels of transcriptional activation. Compared with the high activity of transcriptional activation of the amino terminus of LlSCL protein, the full-length LlSCL protein exhibited lower activity (Fig. 6). The carboxyl terminus region of the LlSCL includes two parts, a leucine heptad repeat and an LXXLL motif, both of which mediate protein-protein interaction. Thus, it is possible that the LlSCL protein interacts with factors involved in the regulation of transcription via these protein domains that modulate the level of transcriptional activation. Richards et al. (29Richards D.E. Peng J. Harberd N.P. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 573-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) proposed that GRAS gene products were related to the STAT family of proteins based on structural similarities between GRAS and STAT family proteins. Because STATs are activated by the receptor kinase (30Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3330) Google Scholar), the LlSCL protein could also be phosphorylated by an unknown protein kinase for a suitable function. Because the O-GlcNAc modification and serine/threonine phosphorylation are broadly observed in eukaryotic cells (31Hart G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 315-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), it will be interesting to analyze the properties of mutated LlSCL proteins with amino acid substitutions within the serine stretch region. LlSCL Protein May Play a Role in Transcriptional Regulation during Microsporogenesis—By the experiments of transient expression of the full-length LlSCL protein in plant cells, we found that the LlSCL protein may activate the expression of the meiosis-associated gene in lily PMCs (Fig. 9). To our knowledge, this is the first report indicating that the GRAS gene product is directly involved in regulation of a specific gene expression. Together with the result of mRNA accumulation pattern, we report here for the first time that a GRAS gene is involved in the specific gene expression during microsporogenesis. The results obtained in this study indicated that the LlSCL protein requires a specific factor(s) for specific activation in PMCs, because the LlSCL protein did not elevate the activities of LIM10 promoter in BY-2 and leaves. Thus, the LlSCL protein functions as a co-activator for activating a gene expression with the specific factor(s). To elucidate the mechanisms involved in LlSCL-mediated gene expression, it is necessary to isolate the specific factor(s) that activate LIM10 gene expression in concert with the LlSCL protein. Further studies will be needed to define the biological functions and biochemical properties of LlSCL protein in the microsporogenesis and anther development in lily. However, because of our inability to conduct a molecular genetics approach, studies using a lily system are rather limited. The GRAS gene, which shows a high similarity to LlSCL gene, would have a similar function in the anthers from various species. Recently, we identified a gene encoding the LlSCL homolog from Arabidopsis and rice. 4K. Morohashi, H. Takase, and K. Hiratsuka, unpublished data. The availability of LlSCL homologs from these species would allow further study of the function and biological implication of the LlSCL gene."

In humans, α-Gal is a lysosomal exoglycosidase that cleaves the terminal α-galactose residue from glycolipids and glycoproteins. Mutations in the α-Gal gene cause incomplete degradation of carbohydrates, resulting in Fabry disease (1Brady R.O. Gal A.E. Bradley R.M. Martensson E. Warshaw A.L. Laster L. N. Engl. J.

In plants, galactomannan is one of the major storage polysaccharides in seeds, and α-Gal is one of the key enzymes in the degradation of cell wall galactomannan during germination (3Reid J.S.

Biochemistry of Storage Carbohydrates in Green Plants. Academic Press, London1985: 205-288Google Scholar). Raffinose and stachyose in beans are known to cause flatulence, and α-Gal has the potential to alleviate these symptoms (5Dey P.M. Patel S. Brownleader M.D. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1993; 17: 361-371PubMed Google Scholar). In the sugar beet industry, α-Gal has been used to increase the sucrose yield by eliminating raffinose, which prevents normal crystallization of beet sugar (6Yamane T. Sucr. Belg. 1971; 90: 345-348Google Scholar). We have purified and sequenced several α-Gals from Mortierella vinacea, Penicillium purpurogenum, Thermus sp. T2, and Oryza sativa L. and have elucidated the substrate specificities of these enzymes using two types of the galactomanno-oligosaccharides, 63-mono-α-D-galactopyranosyl-β-1,4-mannotriose and 63-mono-α-D-galactopyranosyl-β-1,4-mannotetraose (7Shibuya H.

The M. vinacea α-Gal I and yeast α-Gals were specific only for 63-mono-α-D-galactopyranosyl-β-1,4-mannotriose, which has an α-galactosyl residue (designated the terminal α-galactosyl residue) linked to the non-reducing end mannose of β-1,4-mannotriose (14Kaneko R.

Aspergillis niger α-Gal and P. purpurogenum α-Gal, however, showed a preference for 63-mono-α-D-galactopyranosyl-β-1,4-mannotetraose, which has an α-galactosyl residue (designated the side-chain α-galactosyl residue) attached to the inner mannose of β-1,4-mannotetraose (8Shibuya H.

In addition, M. vinacea α-Gal II and plant α-Gals were active on the polymeric substrate galactomannans with high efficiency (9Shibuya H. Kobayashi H. Sato T. Kim W.S. Yoshida S. Kaneko S. Kasamo K.

To date, the primary structures of over 50 α-Gals have been deduced from gene or cDNA sequences. Primary structure and hydrophobic cluster analyses have shown that α-Gals can be classified mainly into the glycoside hydrolase families 4, 27, and 36 (19Henrissat B. Davies G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar, 20Henrissat B. Davies G.J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1515-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). α-Gals from eukaryotes have high amino acid sequence similarities and are basically classified into family 27, whereas bacterial α-Gals are grouped into families 4 and 36. The hydrolysis mechanism of α-Gal is known to proceed with retention of the stereochemistry at the anomeric center through the double displacement mechanism, and the nucleophile of the catalytic residue is an aspartic acid that is highly conserved in all known family 27 α-Gals and other glycosyl hydrolases (21Hart D.O.

Recently, the crystal structure of chicken α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (α-NAGal; E.C. 3.2.1.49), which catalyzes the hydrolysis of a terminal α-N-acetylgalactosamine from glycosylated substrate, has been solved in its free form and in complex with α-N-acetylgalactosamine (23Garman S.C. Hannick L. Zhu A. Garboczi D.N. Structure. 2002; 10: 425-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This enzyme belongs to family 27 of the glycoside hydrolases and consists of two domains, i.e. an N-terminal domain comprised of a (β/α)8-barrel as a catalytic domain and a C-terminal domain with eight β-strands containing a Greek key motif. The tertiary structure of the catalytic site has provided support for the catalytic mechanism and revealed the mode of substrate binding in α-NAGal. The structure has also served as a paradigm for constructing models of human α-NAGal and α-Gal based on their high amino acid similarities. In contrast, there has been no report on the three-dimensional structures of the α-Gals, although a few preliminary crystallization papers have been reported (24Golubev A.M. Neustroev K.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 933-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 25Murali R. Ioannou Y.A. Desnick R.J. Burnett R.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 578-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Recently, we have succeeded in carrying out overexpression, purification, and crystallization of the family 27 α-Gal from rice (O. sativa L. subsp. japonica var. Nipponbare) (13Kim W. Kobayashi O. Kaneko S. Sakakibara Y. Park G. Kusakabe I. Tanaka H. Kobayashi H. Phytochemistry. 2002; 61: 621-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 26Fujimoto Z. Kobayashi O. Kaneko S. Momma M. Kobayashi H. Mizuno H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1374-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Rice α-Gal consists of 362 amino acid residues, and its molecular mass is ∼40 kDa. We report here that the crystal structure of rice α-Gal in complex with d-galactose was determined at 1.5 Å resolution. This structure may be useful in future protein engineering studies and the rational design of α-Gals for industrial use. We also make structural comparisons of rice α-Gal with chicken α-NAGal with a view toward understanding the substrate recognition mechanism in these enzymes. Crystallization and Data Collection—Rice α-Gal was purified and crystallized as reported previously (13Kim W. Kobayashi O. Kaneko S. Sakakibara Y. Park G. Kusakabe I. Tanaka H. Kobayashi H. Phytochemistry. 2002; 61: 621-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 26Fujimoto Z. Kobayashi O. Kaneko S. Momma M. Kobayashi H. Mizuno H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1374-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The needle- and/or rod-shaped crystals of rice α-Gal were obtained within 2 weeks by mixing 5 μl of protein solution (15 mg/ml) with 5 μl of reservoir solution (5%2-propanol, 0.1 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m acetate buffer, pH4.5, with 5% d-galactose) at 293 K, employing the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. Diffraction experiments on the native crystals were first carried out at beamline BL6A, Photon Factory, Tsukuba, Japan (λ = 0.978 Å). α-Gal crystals were flash-frozen in a nitrogen stream at 100 K using 20% glycerol as a cryo-protectant. Diffraction data were collected using a Quantum CCD x-ray detector (Area Detector Systems Corporation, Poway, CA) in 2° oscillation steps over a range of 180°. The native data set was processed and scaled using DPS/MOSFLM (27Rossmann M.G. van Beek C.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1631-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Structure Determination—Heavy atom derivatives of the crystals were prepared by conventional soaking methods for the multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) method. The heavy atom compounds were dissolved in mother liquor at a final concentration of 10–20 mm. Soaked crystals were left at room temperature for 2–3 h, then soaked in glycerol solution, and then flash-frozen in a nitrogen stream at 100 K. Data sets were collected using the CuKα x-ray diffractometer and imaging plate detector R-axis IV2+ (Rigaku, Japan). The interpretation of the heavy atom derivative data was initially done using self-vector verification of three-dimensional difference Patterson functions with a CCP4 program package (28Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Two mercury positions of the methylmercury chloride derivative were clearly obtained from the Patterson maps. The gold positions of the AuK(CN)2 derivative were then obtained from difference Fourier maps made with single isomorphous replacement phases from the mercury derivative. Two mercury and two gold positions were obtained, and these heavy atom parameters were refined and the phases were computed with program MLPHARE (29Otwinowski, Z. (1991) in Proceedings of the Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Study Weekend (Wolf, W., Evans, P. R., and Leslie, A. G. W., eds) pp. 80-88, SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UKGoogle Scholar) in the CCP4 program package using reflections from 50–1.9 Å resolution. Data collection and heavy atom refinement statistics are shown in Table I. The MIR phase was improved by solvent flattening and density modifications using the program DM (30Cowtan K. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar) in the CCP4 program package. Model building was initially conducted using the auto-modeling program ARP/wARP (31Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V. Nature Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar), and the R-factor and the connectivity improved to 19.3 and 98%, respectively, after two trials of 100-cycle calculations. Further model rebuilding was conducted manually with program QUANTA98 (Accelrys). The model was refined with program CNS (32Brünger A. Adams P. Clore G. DeLano W. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R. Jiang J. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N. Read R. Rice L. Simonson T. Warren G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). During the course of refinement, Fo - Fc maps were calculated, and clear densities corresponding to the galactose molecule were found in the active site pocket. Similarly, the bound water molecules were identified. A crystallographic R-factor and an Rfree-factor, which was calculated by setting aside 10% of the reflection data, were improved to 19.0% and 22.9%, respectively. Subsequent refinements were carried out to 1.5 Å resolution using a new native data set taken at the beamline BL41XU at SPring-8, Harima, Japan. Diffraction data were collected using the MAR CCD x-ray detector (MAR Research, Evanston, IL) in 1° oscillation steps over the range of 180°, and the data set was processed and scaled using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK in the HKL2000 package (33Otwinowski, Z.

Data collection statistics are listed in Table I, and structure refinement statistics are tabulated in Table II. The final model consisted of a single chain of 362 amino acids with a catalytic domain (1–278) and a C-terminal domain (279–362, Fig. 1). The catalytic domain was comprised of a (β/α)8-barrel, which was observed earlier in a triose phosphate isomerase (35Banner D.W. Bloomer A.C. Petsko G.A. Phillips D.C. Pogson C.I. Wilson I.A. Corran P.H. Furth A.J. Milman D.J. Offord R.E. Priddle J.D. Waley S.G. Nature. 1975; 255: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar) and which now represents a common motif in many glycoside hydrolases. The active site pocket was found on the C-terminal side of the central β-barrel of the catalytic domain where a d-galactose molecule, which was added during crystallization, was identified as a binding ligand. Two disulfide bonds were located near the catalytic pocket. The C-terminal domain was made up of eight β-strands containing a Greek key motif. The interface between the two domains mainly involved hydrophobic interactions. The role of the C-terminal domain is still unknown. In a Ramachandran plot (36Ramachandran G.N. Sasisekharan V. Adv. Protein Chem. 1968; 23: 283-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (2770) Google Scholar), Tyr-20, located on the surface and close to one of the disulfide bonds, was in the generous region, and Asp-216, buried in the catalytic pocket, was in the disallowed region, although electron densities for both residues were clearly observed. The remaining residues were in the most favored region or the additional allowed region. The overall structure was similar to that of chicken α-NAGal (Protein Data Bank codes 1KTB and 1KTC; Ref. 23Garman S.C. Hannick L. Zhu A. Garboczi D.N. Structure. 2002; 10: 425-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the amino acid sequence alignment of rice α-Gal with chicken α-NAGal and human α-Gal. Most of the amino acids comprising the basic secondary structures of the (β/α)8-barrel in the catalytic domain and the Greek key motif in the C-terminal domain are seen to be well conserved. A stereo view of the superimposed Cα-models of rice α-Gal and chicken α-NAGal is shown in Fig. 3. Although the length of the α-Gal molecule is slightly shorter than that of chicken α-NAGal, largely due to deletions in some loop regions (Fig. 2), the structures of the two enzymes, especially the core region of the (β/α)8-barrel, are basically in good agreement, with root-mean-square differences for Cα atoms of the catalytic domains and the entire two molecules being 1.49 Å and 1.68 Å, respectively.Fig. 3Stereo view of the Cα–superimposed models of rice α-galactosidase and chicken α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase. α-Gal is shown in orange and α-NAGal in blue. The two catalytic residues, the disulfide bonds in both enzymes, the d-galactose molecule bound in α-Gal, and the α-N-acetylgalactosamine molecule in α-NAGal are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Active Site and Substrate Binding—Under the crystallization conditions, the addition of d-galactose served to improve resolution of the crystal. The crystal structure of α-Gal was thus solved as a complex with d-galactose. Fig. 4 shows the Fo - Fc omit map for bound d-galactose and two catalytic aspartates. The density map at 1.5 Å resolution gave clear identification of a chair conformation of the sugar ring and the orientation of the hydroxyl groups. At the anomeric C1 carbon, multi-conformational electron densities corresponding to both α-anomeric and β-anomeric O1 hydroxyl groups were clearly observed, indicating that the d-galactose molecules was bound as a mixture of two anomeric forms. From the intensity of the densities, the α-anomer and β-anomer were estimated to be present in the ratio of 0.3 and 0.7, respectively, which is similar to the ratio of the natural abundance of 0.36/0.64 for the solution state of galactopyranose. Furthermore, the B-factors of these atoms calculated to be almost the same when the occupancy of these atoms were set at this ratio. The α-anomeric hydroxyl group projected outwards, whereas the β-anomeric hydroxyl group pointed to the side of the active pocket. In an enzymatic reactions involving the two anomers, the enzyme selectively binds to the α-galacto-oligosaccharide, because the enzyme cannot bind to the β-galacto-oligosaccharide whose β-anomeric oxygen would be pointed toward the bottom of the catalytic pocket. But, if the monomeric galactose molecule were in high concentration, it is possible that it may act as a competitor of the substrate. Fig. 5A shows the structure of the α-Gal/galactose complex around the catalytic pocket. The galactose molecule is seen buried in the catalytic pocket with the α-anomeric O1 hydroxyl group open to the surface. Catalytic residues found in rice α-Gal were two aspartic acids, i.e. Asp-130 located at the end of strand β4, and Asp-185 after strand β6. Asp-130 was hydrogen bonded to the β-anomeric O1 hydroxyl oxygen and was located within hydrogen-bonding distance of the O5 atom of the galactose molecule. Another catalytic residue, Asp-185, was hydrogen bonded to the α-anomeric O1 hydroxyl and O2 hydroxyl oxygen atoms. As proposed previously (23Garman S.C. Hannick L. Zhu A. Garboczi D.N. Structure. 2002; 10: 425-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), catalysis by this enzyme seems to involve a double-displacement mechanism. In rice α-Gal, Asp-185 works as a catalytic acid/base, and Asp-130 acts as a nucleophile inasmuch as Asp-130 is located close to the anomeric carbon C1 atom of the galactose (2.5 Å), and Asp-185 is near the α-anomeric hydroxyl O1 atom, which corresponds to the oxygen atom in the α-1,6-glycosidic linkage to substrate. The distance between two carboxyl groups was 6.5Å, which is close to the standard distance of 5.5Å in other normal retaining glycosyl hydrolases (37Ly H. Withers S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 487-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), considering that the galactose molecule is accommodated over a distance of two residues. Besides the catalytic residues, other residues had hydrophilic and hydrophobic contacts to the ligand. Arg-181, Trp-164, and Cys-162, as well as Asp-185 formed hydrogen bonds with the O2 oxygen atom of galactose. Lys-128 hydrogen bonded to the two hydroxyl oxygen O3 and O4 atoms. Asp-51 had a hydrogen bond to the hydroxyl oxygen O4 atom, and Asp-52 hydrogen bonded to the O6 atom. In addition, hydrophobic contacts were observed for residues Trp-16, Cys-101, and Met-217. The aromatic indole ring of Trp-16 did not face the sugar ring but rather toward a sort of flat surface formed by the O3, C3, C4, C5, C6, and O6 atoms of the bound galactose in a manner which is often seen in galactose-binding proteins and lectins (38Elgavish S. Shaanan B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 462-467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Cys-101 formed one of the two disulfide bridges with Cys-132. A total of 11 residues were involved in galactose binding. A previous study has shown that this enzyme is completely inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoic acid is and strongly inhibited by Hg2+ and Ag2+ (13Kim W. Kobayashi O. Kaneko S. Sakakibara Y. Park G. Kusakabe I. Tanaka H. Kobayashi H. Phytochemistry. 2002; 61: 621-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because Cys-162 is one of three free cysteine residues in the catalytic pocket, these metal reagents may attack the cysteine and interfere with substrate binding in the catalytic site. Specificity against Monomeric Galactose—The catalytic pocket of rice α-Gal was similar to that of chicken α-NAGal. Fig. 5B shows the structure around the bound ligand of rice α-Gal superimposed onto that of chicken α-NAGal. In both of these, most of the surrounding residues were well conserved, and any difference in the two could be seen only in a single loop between strand β5 and helix α5. The loop of α-NAGal was longer by six amino acids than that of α-Gal, making a short helical structure that was not conserved in rice α-Gal (Fig. 3). In α-NAGal, Tyr-176 and Arg-197 sandwiched the whole N-acetyl moiety, and Ser-172 and Ala-175 coordinated with the carbonyl oxygen atom and the methyl group, respectively. Garman et al. (23Garman S.C. Hannick L. Zhu A. Garboczi D.N. Structure. 2002; 10: 425-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) has designated this loop as “N-acetyl recognition loop.” In the case of rice α-Gal, Trp-164 and Cys-162 in this loop replaced Ala-175 and Ser-172 of α-NAGal, filling up the cavity for the N-acetyl group so that alternatively this loop could also be referred to as “N-acetyl blocking loop” or “substrate discriminating loop”. The pocket for α-NAGal is longer than that for α-Gal, providing space necessary for the N-acetyl group. It is possible that this longer loop evolved by changes in the amino acid composition to accommodate these different substrates. The amino acid sequence homology of human α-Gal with respect to chicken α-NAGal is 50% compared with 37% for rice α-Gal (Fig. 2). As far as the substrate discriminating loop is concerned, human α-Gal has a longer loop resembling that of chicken α-NAGal, such that the cavity used for accommodating the N-acetyl group could be occupied by leucine and glutamic acid in human α-Gal in place of the corresponding residues Ala-175 and Ser-172 of α-NAGal, as discussed by Garman et al. (23Garman S.C. Hannick L. Zhu A. Garboczi D.N. Structure. 2002; 10: 425-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The leucine, glutamic acid, and neighboring amino acid residues might be considered well conserved in the two α-Gals if Leu-161 is inserted at the end of the fifth β-strand of rice α-Gal. However, this single insertion of Leu-161 would cause a drastic change in the positions and orientations of Cys-162, Glu-163, and Trp-164 as well as a disruption of the third disulfide bridge. In turn, Trp-164 or Cys-162 would have to assume a new role in order to recognize the galactose substrate moiety. Among members of the α-Gal family, most of the enzymes from bacteria, yeast, and plant have this single amino acid insertion before the substrate discriminating loop compared with the enzymes in animal (13Kim W. Kobayashi O. Kaneko S. Sakakibara Y. Park G. Kusakabe I. Tanaka H. Kobayashi H. Phytochemistry. 2002; 61: 621-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Considering these facts, the single insertion might represent the point at which branching off occurred during the evolution of the α-Gals. Specificity against Galacto-oligosaccharides—The rice α-Gal, as well as the other eukaryotic α-Gals, can accommodate both terminal and side-chain α-galactosyl residues. The crystal structure of the galactose complex showed that the α-anomeric oxygen atom of the bound galactose molecule projected directly toward the solvent area, leaving enough space in the catalytic pocket so that the bound α-galactosyl residue in the catalytic pocket could be linked to either the terminal or the inner sugar of the manno-oligosaccharide through an α-1,6-glycosidic bond. It is still unclear whether the enzyme recognizes the other sugars of the substrate besides the α-galactosyl moiety. But, at the surface, Trp-16 and Trp-164 contributed partly to a build up of the catalytic pocket, whereas Tyr-20 and His-18 were localized on the surface near the catalytic pocket. Because aromatic residues are often used in recognizing the sugar moieties in enzymes and lectins (38Elgavish S. Shaanan B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 462-467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), the above residues might be considered candidates for substrate recognition. It has been shown that some bacterial and yeast α-Gals can cleave only terminal α-galactosyl or only side-chained α-galactosyl residues (8Shibuya H. Kobayashi H. Park G.G. Komatsu Y. Sato T.

For examples, M. vinacea α-Gal I and Saccharomyces cerevisiae α-Gal, which act on only the terminal α-galactosyl residues, have a 20-amino acid insertion before the helix α6, whereas P. purpurogenum α-Gal, which acts on only the side-chained α-galactosyl residues, has a 30-amino acid insertion before helix α4. Because the sequences of the core β/α-barrel are highly conserved among various α-Gals, these insertions could cause the extended loops to bulge out and possibly obstruct the catalytic pocket, thereby limiting accessibility to the side-chained or terminal α-galactosyl residues. Alternatively, they may cause more subsites against α-galactosyl oligosaccharides to be formed, resulting in multiple specificities against the α-galactosyl moiety. As we still lack sufficient data to model the inserted loops, the three-dimensional structures of the other types of α-Gals are necessary to clarify these differences in substrate specificities.

In mammalian cells, polyamine pool homeostasis is maintained by a balance of enzymatic and transport processes as follows. (a) Putrescine (PUT) is derived from ornithine via ornithine decarboxylase and (b) condenses with decarboxylate S-adenosyl-L-methionine to yield SPD by the action of SPD synthase. (c) SPM is generated from SPD and decarboxylate S-adenosyl-L-methionine via SPM synthase. (Decarboxylated S-adenosyl-L-methionine is the product of S-adenosyl-L-methionine decarboxylase.) (d) Acetyl-CoA:SPD/SPM N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT) transforms SPM and SPD into N1-acetyl-SPM and N1-acetyl-SPD. (e) N1-Acetylated polyamine oxidase (PAO; EC 1.5.3.11) converts N1-acetyl-SPM to SPD and 3-acetamidopropanal, and it converts N1-acetyl-SPD to PUT and 3-acetamidopropanal (Fig. 1). It also oxidizes inefficiently SPM to SPD and 3-aminopropanal. (f) Spermine oxidase (SMO) oxidizes SPM to SPD and 3-aminopropanal (10Wang Y. Devereux W. Woster P.M. Stewart T.M. Hacker A.

(g) The N1-acetylated polyamines are transported from cells to the blood and then to the kidneys for urine excretion. (h) PUT, SPD, and SPM derived from ingested foods are efficiently transported into cells (1Seiler N. Prog. Brain Res. 1995; 106: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Peroxisomal mammalian PAO contains noncovalently bound FAD as the redox cofactor. When PAO oxidizes N1-acetyl-SPM or N1-acetyl-SPD, FAD is reduced, which is oxidized subsequently by O2 to generate H2O2 (1Seiler N. Prog.

By definition, PAO, designated EC 1.5.3.11, is a flavoprotein that oxidizes specifically N1-acetyl-SPM and N1-acetyl-SPD. To date, an EC number for SMO has not been assigned.

In particular, all have an easily identified FAD-binding motif near their N termini. This and other features of the primary structures indicate that these enzymes are members of a larger family of amine oxidases that includes mitochondrial monoamine oxidase A and B (26Binda C.

These amine oxidases belong to an even larger enzyme superfamily (the glutathione reductase (GR) superfamily) that includes various disulfide reductases (GR1 family), glucose oxidase, fumarate reductase, cholesterol oxidase, D-amino acid oxidase (GR2 family, for which PAO is a member), protoporphyrinogen oxidase, and phytoene desaturase (31Dailey T.A.

Mattevi A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Although PAO has significant clinical and pharmacological relevance pertaining to cancer, ischemic tissue damage, apoptosis, etc., there is a paucity of solid data regarding the biochemical properties, mechanism of substrate oxidation, mechanism of inhibition by highly selective compounds such as N1,N4-bis(butadienyl)-1,4-diaminobutane (MDL 72527) and N1-butadienyl-1,4-diaminobutane (MDL 72521) (1Seiler N. Prog. Brain Res. 1995; 106: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), or structural information for any mammalian PAO. This situation prompted us to initiate a program to create a system to produce PAO heterologously. This paper reports the cloning and the complete sequencing of murine pao (mpao), the sequencing of all but a small portion of bovine pao (bpao), and the production of active mPAO by Escherichia coli at a reasonable level. Various aspects of UV-visible biochemical, spectral, redox, and steady-state kinetic properties of the heterologously produced pure mPAO are presented below.

Silica gel (HETLC-GHL) and Avicel (cellulose, 250 μm) TLC plates were from Analtech. Silica gel, for flash chromatography (40-μm particle size), was from J. T. Baker, Inc. All other chemicals, purchased from common vendors, were of reagent grade or better. Molecular Biology reagents were from various vendors as follows: ethidium bromide (Amersham Biosciences), restriction enzymes (Invitrogen and New England Biolabs), and isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside (Amersham Biosciences), for example. Analytical Procedures—Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS; positive-ion mode and negative-ion mode) and elemental analyses of organic chemicals were done by HT Laboratories, San Diego, CA. One-dimensional 300 MHz (Nicolet/GE NT 300) 1H NMR spectra were obtained from Acorn NMR, Inc., Livermore, CA. The liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectral analysis of pure mPAO was done using a Finnigan LCQ Deca XP (ion trap mass spectrometer). The work was performed at the State University of New York Health Science Center Mass Spectrometry Facility (Brooklyn, NY). Uncorrected capillary tube melting points were determined using a Misco aluminum block device. Synthesis of 1-Acetamido-3,3-diethoxypropane—1-Amino-3,3-diethoxypropane (the diethyl acetal of 3-aminopropanal), 6.5 ml (5.9 g, 0.04 mol), was dissolved in 50 ml of dry pyridine at 0 °C. Over a 25-min period, with stirring, 6.7 ml (7.25 g, 0.071 mol) of acetic anhydride were added dropwise. The mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred overnight. A small spot of the reaction mixture, dried on an Avicel TLC plate, was sprayed with a solution of ninhydrin (0.1% w/v in n-butyl alcohol). Heating the plate for several minutes at 200 °C indicated that all of the material had been acetylated. The pyridine, acetic acid, and acetic anhydride were removed in a rotary evaporator under high vacuum at 50–65 °C to yield 7.86 g of material (expected yield 7.57 g). The recovered material was distilled under vacuum (0.45 mm Hg); b.p. 111 °C, 6.88 g, 91% yield. 1H NMR, CDCl3 (ppm relative to tetramethylsilane), 7.29 (0.98, s, amide-NH), 4.57 (1.00, t, propyl-CH), 3.68 (2.02, m, ethyl-CH2), 3.52 (2.05, m, ethyl-CH2), 3.35 (2.07, m, propyl-CH2), 1.95 (2.92, s, amide-CH3), 1.82 (2.04, m, propyl-CH2), 1.22 (6.00, t, ethyl-CH3). To our knowledge this compound has not been described previously. Synthesis of the 2,4-Dinitrophenylhydrazone of 3-Acetamidopropanal—1-Acetamido-3,3-diethoxypropane, 250 mg (1.3 mmol), was mixed with 1.0 ml of 1.5 n HCl. After 2–3 min, this was added to a boiling solution of 5 ml of ethanol/0.5 ml of concentrated HCl containing 295 mg of 2,4-dintrophenylhydrazine (1.5 mmol). Heating was stopped immediately, and 10 ml of room temperature ethanol were added. In a few minutes, the 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone began to crystallize. After 1 h at room temperature and 1 h on ice, the solid was filtered and washed with a small volume of ice-cold ethanol. The yield of the 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone of 3-acetamidopropanal was 335 mg (1.13 mmol, 86% yield); m.p. 157.5–158 °C. 1H NMR, d6-Me2SO (ppm relative to tetramethylsilane), 11.35 (0.95, s, hydrazone-NH), 9.82 (0.86, d, aromatic-H), 8.33 (1.01, d-d, aromatic-H), 7.97 (1.91, m, propyl-CH and amide-H), 7.86 (1.04, d, aromatic-H), 3.31 (∼2, m, propyl-CH2, overlaps with H2O peak), 2.49 (∼2, m, propyl-CH2, overlaps with Me2SO peaks), 1.81 (2.97, s, amide-CH3); ESI-MS, m/z, 294 [M — H]— (negative ion mode), 296 [M + H]+, 237 [M — acetamido]+ (positive ion mode). Purification of bPAO and Amino Acid Sequencing of Segments of This Enzyme—Bovine livers were covered with ice and transported to the laboratory within 1 h after their removal from live animals at a local slaughterhouse. Following a published procedure (34Gasparyan V.K. Biokhimiya. 1995; 60: 1632-1636PubMed Google Scholar), bPAO was purified from fresh liver, or tissue that had been cut into 1-inch cubes from fresh liver and immediately frozen and stored at —80 °C. About 1 mg of nearly pure bPAO was obtained from 1 kg of tissue. The enzyme was purified further on a 10% Tris-HCl SDS “Ready Gel” (Bio-Rad), then electro-transferred onto an Immobilon-PSQ membrane (Millipore), and Coomassie Blue-stained. The membrane was submitted to the Biomolecular Resource Center (University of California, San Francisco, CA) for the N-terminal sequence analysis. Purified bPAO was electrophoresed as before, and the Coomassie Blue-stained bPAO band was excised and subjected to an in-gel tryptic digest at the Protein Sequencing Center at the State University of New York, Brooklyn, NY. Two major internal peptides (Peptide I and Peptide II; see Fig. 2) were purified and sequenced. Cloning and Sequencing of bpao and mpao—GenBankTM EST data bases were searched using three bPAO peptide sequences (see above). Two murine ESTs (GenBankTM accession numbers AA437705 and AI098814) were found to code for aminoacyl sequences that were ∼85% identical to that of bPAO Peptide I (see Fig. 2). Both clones (IMAGE numbers 819909 and 1482295, respectively) were purchased from Genome Systems, Inc. (St. Louis, MO), and plasmids were isolated using a Qiagen kit and sequenced. (All DNA sequencing work was done at the Biomolecular Resource Center, University of California, San Francisco, CA). The AA437705 cDNA fragment (mpao1) was released from its plasmid by an XbaI/SalI digestion. This fragment was the template for generating a mixture of [32P]dATP-labeled probes, by using a random-primed DNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science) (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The 32P-labeled probes were used to screen a λgt 10-mouse 17-day embryo cDNA library (Clontech) and a Uni-ZAP XR bovine liver cDNA library (Stratagene). Seventeen positive phage plaques from the bovine cDNA library and 16 positive plaques from the mouse cDNA library were obtained and rescreened. The final positive clones, containing different length mpao and bpao cDNA inserts, were isolated and confirmed by standard Southern blotting (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using the same 32P-labeled probes. The largest mpao fragments from these clones were sequenced. A fragment of bpao cDNA was excised from the Uni-ZP XR vector of the pBluescript phagemid. This 1.6-kb fragment (bpao1) was sequenced using flanking primers (T3/T7), and it coded for all but a small section of the N-terminal portion of bPAO. The 5′-end of the fragment coded for a sequence that matched exactly the C-terminal portion of Peptide I (see Fig. 2). A region near the 3′-end coded for a protein sequence identical to that of Peptide II, which was determined later to be the C terminus of the enzyme (see Fig. 2). The high similarity between the sequences of bpao1 and mpao1 confirmed that the mpao1 screening probe codes for a portion of mPAO. DNA isolated from one plaque of the mouse cDNA library was cloned into the SalI sites of pUC19 to give the plasmid, pUC19_MPAO1, that was used for double-stranded sequencing. The sequence of this fragment (mpao2) was missing the 5′-end of the complete mpao sequence (see under “Results”).A5′-extension (see Fig. 2) was obtained using the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR method with mouse 17-day embryo Marathon Ready cDNA (Clontech) as the template and using a SMARTTM PCR cDNA Synthesis kit (Clontech) for the PCRs. The mpao gene-specific antisense primer, mpao1R (5′-GTTCTCTTCCGATAATTCTTTCTCC-3′), spans nucleotides 333 to 309 of mpao (see Fig. 2), and the Clontech AP1 universal sense adaptor primer was specific for the Marathon Ready cDNA; 5 cycles for 30 s at 94 °C and 3 min at 72 °C, 5 cycles for 30 s at 94 °C and 3 min at 70 °C, and 30 cycles for 20 s at 94 °C and 3 min at 68 °C. By using a 50-fold dilution of the resulting PCR product as template, and AP2 (an AP1-nested primer) and mpao1R as primers, a second PCR was carried out under the same conditions. The resulting cDNA fragment, about 400 bp long, was isolated from a 1% agarose gel using a Geneclean kit (Bio 101). Melded with mpao2, the sequenced PCR product provided a 1.7-kb section of mpao that coded for full-length mPAO. Measuring the Relative Levels of mpao mRNA in Different Murine Tissues—Murine Rapid-Scan Gene Expression Panels were purchased from OriGene Technologies, Inc. Two gene-specific primers were designed according to the manufacturer's instruction. The sense primer, mpao2F (5′-TCGGAAGAGAACCAGCTTGTGG-3′, 22-mer), and the antisense primer, mpao2R (5′-CAATGACATGATGTGCAGGCA-3′, 22-mer), generated a 570-bp-long mpao cDNA fragment by PCR. The 24 mouse cDNA samples, serially diluted over a 4-log range (×1000, 100, 100, and 1) by the manufacturer, were arrayed into a 96-well PCR plate. The first step of the PCRs were carried out at 94 °C for 3 min, which was followed by 35 cycles: 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. The control-primer pair for detection of β-actin cDNA, provided by the manufacturer, was used for a PCR that was carried out as just described with 25 cycles. The amplified fragments were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel and ethidium bromide-stained to provided a measure of mpao mRNA in each tissue. Expression of mpao in E. coli—The pET 29 c(+) vector (Novagen) was used to construct a mpao prokaryotic expression system, and E. coli DH5α was used for plasmid subcloning. First, a 5′-end fragment was generated by PCR using mpao1 as the template for the gene-specific antisense primer mpao1R (see above), and a sense primer, mpao1F, which contains SacI and NdeI sites and an ATG start codon (5′-GCGAGCTCATACATATGGCGTTCCCTGGCCCGCGG-3′). The underlined regions indicate SacI and NdeI sites, respectively. A SacI/BamHI fragment of the PCR product was subcloned into pUC19-MPAO1 to give pUC19-MPAO. This construct contained the entire mpao gene. Next, the full-length mpao cDNA was ligated into NdeI and HindIII sites of pET 29c to give a plasmid denoted pET-MPAO. E. coli BL21 GOLD (DE3) (Invitrogen) was transformed with this plasmid for mPAO production. Growth of Transformed Bacteria—A culture of the E. coli transformant was grown on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin. A single positive colony was inoculated into 3 ml of LB broth containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin (LB-kan) for overnight growth at 37 °C. This culture (500 μl) was transferred to 80 ml of fresh LB-kan medium for overnight growth. Five milliliters of this culture were transferred to each of five 2-liter flasks containing 1 liter of fresh LB-kan medium for overnight growth at 37 °C, with shaking. Each flask was added to one of five 14-liter New Brunswick FS-614 fermentors containing 12 liters of LB-kan media. The cell culture was incubated at 30 °C with rapid stirring and vigorous aeration. When the A600 of the culture reached 0.6–0.7, isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside was added (final concentration, 50 μm). Growth was continued until the A600 reached 1.5–2.0. About 260 g of centrifuged cell paste were obtained from the 60 liters of growth media. The paste was stored at —80 °C. Purification of Heterologously Produced mPAO—Selected fractions for the various steps in the purification were assayed for N1-acetyl-SPM oxidase activities by a published method (36Holt A. Sharman D.F. Baker G.B. Palcic M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 244: 384-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). This assay measured the time-dependent formation of H2O2 (Fig. 1). The assay stock solutions are as follows: (A) 100 mm vanillic acid, pH 7.0 with KOH; (B) 50 mm 4-aminopyrine; (C) 400 units/ml horseradish peroxidase; (D) 50 mmN1-acetyl-SPM; (E) 100 mm glycine/KOH, pH 9.5, the pH for maximal activity (37Hölttä E. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 94: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thirty microliters each of solutions A–D were mixed with 2.88 ml of solution E, and 50 μl of the resulting solution were pipetted into individual wells of a 96-well plate. Anywhere from 1 to 50 μl of a particular fraction was added to a well. The relative activities of different fractions were assessed visually from the time-dependent intensity change of the developing pink color. The purity of various fractions were assessed by SDS-PAGE using pre-cast 10–20% Tris-HCl “Ready Gels” (Bio-Rad), following the manufacturer's instructions. Unless noted otherwise, all purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. Frozen E. coli cell paste (260 g) was thawed in a beaker with 10 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.25. (The pH was adjusted at 21 °C; the estimated pH at 4 °C is 7.35). The 800-ml suspension was homogenized with a large glass/Teflon piston (Potter/Elvehjem) tissue grinder, and then passed twice through an Avestin Emulsiflex C5 Homogenizer at 15–20,000 pounds/square inch. Next, 15 mg of solid FAD were dissolved in the suspension, and it was centrifuged (50,000 × g, for 30 min). The supernatant was dialyzed in the dark against 13 liters of 10 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.25, for 4 h and then overnight against 13 liters of fresh buffer. The resulting solution was diluted to 2 liters with this buffer and applied to a 14 × 25-cm DEAE-cellulose (Whatman, DE53) column with a flow rate of 20 ml/min. The column was then washed with 2 liters of the buffer and eluted with an 8-liter gradient from 0 to 400 mm KCl in the 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.25 buffer. Activity eluted from 4.7–7.8 liters after the gradient was initiated. The 3.1-liter volume was reduced to ∼500 ml using 350 ml of Amicon pressure concentrators fitted with Amicon YM-10 membranes. After dissolving 15 mg of FAD, the resulting solution was dialyzed in the dark for 4 h against 13 liters of 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.8 (pH adjusted at 21 °C; estimated pH at 4 °C was 8.05), and then overnight against 13 liters of fresh buffer. The resulting sample was applied to a 5 × 39-cm DEAE-Spherodex LS column (100–300 μm bead size; Ciphergen) already equilibrated with the 10 mm HEPES buffer. The column was washed with 500 ml of"
https://openalex.org/W2170191063,"We previously proposed that ductal bile formation is regulated by secretin-responsive relocation of aquaporin 1 (AQP1), a water-selective channel protein, from an intracellular vesicular compartment to the apical membrane of cholangiocytes. In this study, we immunoisolated AQP1-containing vesicles from cholangiocytes prepared from rat liver; quantitative immunoblotting revealed enrichment in these vesicles of not only AQP1 but also cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) and AE2, a Cl- channel and a Cl−/HCO3− exchanger, respectively. Dual labeled immunogold electron microscopy of cultured polarized mouse cholangiocytes showed significant colocalization of AQP1, CFTR, and AE2 in an intracellular vesicular compartment; exposure of cholangiocytes to dibutyryl-cAMP (100 μm) resulted in co-redistribution of all three proteins to the apical cholangiocyte plasma membrane. After administration of secretin to rats in vivo, bile flow increased, and AQP1, CFTR, and AE2 co-redistributed to the apical cholangiocyte membrane; both events were blocked by pharmacologic disassembly of microtubules. Based on these in vitro and in vivo observations utilizing independent and complementary approaches, we propose that cholangiocytes contain an organelle that sequesters functionally related proteins that can account for ion-driven water transport, that this organelle moves to the apical cholangiocyte membrane in response to secretory agonists, and that these events account for ductal bile secretion at a molecular level.

Cholangiocytes are cells that line intrahepatic bile ducts and, like other epithelia, possess discrete, specialized apical and basolateral membranes. Each cholangiocyte membrane contains specific receptors and flux molecules (i.e. channels, exchangers, and transporters) that accomplish the vectorial movement of solutes, ions, and water across the biliary epithelial barrier (1Marinelli R.A. LaRusso N.F. Semin. Liver Dis. 1996; 16: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 2Boyer J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G1-G5PubMed Google Scholar, 3Raeder M.G. Curr. Opin. Gastroenterol. 1995; 11: 439-444Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar), resulting in ductal bile formation by as yet unclear molecular mechanisms. Recently, we proposed a molecular model for hormone-induced bile secretion by cholangiocytes. The key feature of this model is the agonist-induced, coordinated, exocytic insertion into and endocytic retrieval from the apical cholangiocyte plasma membrane of key flux molecules that, in the unstimulated state, are sequestered in an intracytoplasmic vesicular compartment (4Kato A. Gores G.J. LaRusso N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15523-15529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also proposed that one of these flux proteins was AQP1, a member of the aquaporin (AQP) 1The abbreviations used are: AQP, aquaporin; BDL, bile duct ligation; CFTR, cystic fibrosis trans-membrane regulator; AE2, chloride/bicarbonate exchanger. family of water channels that mediate the bidirectional, passive movement of water molecules across epithelial cells in response to osmotic gradients established by ions and solutes (1Marinelli R.A.

In support of this model are data showing that secretin, a hormone that stimulates ductal bile secretion, can also trigger the exocytic insertion of AQP1 into the apical cholangiocyte plasma membrane (6Marinelli R.A. Tietz P.S. Pham L.D. Rueckert L. Agre P. LaRusso N.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G280-G286PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, we also provided data in hepatocytes, the other epithelial cell in the liver involved in bile formation, indicating that recycling of AQP8 may account for agonist-induced canalicular bile secretion (8Garcia F.

To extend this general model, we now propose that these agonist-responsive, AQP1-containing vesicles also contain other molecules that are necessary to establish the osmotic gradients that drive passive water movement. In the studies described here, we found that cholangiocytes contain a subpopulation of vesicles in which the water channel AQP1, the chloride channel CFTR, and the chloride/bicarbonate exchanger, AE2, are sequestered in the basal state and that these proteins move together in a microtubule-dependent manner from an intracellular location to the apical cholangiocyte plasma membrane in response to choleretic stimuli. By a variety of independent and complementary biochemical and morphologic approaches, the data support the notion that a novel organelle containing proteins that accomplish both water and ion transport exists in cholangiocytes and participates in hormone-induced bile secretion. This concept is supported by a body of evidence on the physiological implications of colocalization of functionally related molecules in the kidney, including aquaporins with ion transporters, and membrane relocalization after treatment with agonists (9Biner H.L.

Preparation of Cholangiocytes—Male Fisher 344 rats after induction of selective cholangiocyte hyperplasia by bile duct ligation (BDL) were used. The BDL rat is an experimental model of selective cholangiocyte proliferation useful for the study of ductal bile secretion (12Alpini G. Lenzi R. Sarkozi L. Tavoloni N. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 569-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Highly purified cholangiocytes were isolated from livers of BDL rats as previously described (13Ishii M. Vroman B. LaRusso N.F. Gastroenterology. 1989; 97: 1236-1247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoisolation of AQP1-, CFTR-, and AE2-containing Vesicles— Purified cholangiocytes were sonicated, and a postnuclear supernatant was prepared. The postnuclear supernatant was further purified on a linear sucrose gradient (8.6–40%), and the resulting microsomal fraction sedimented at 200,000 × g for 60 min to remove any remaining cytosol. This microsome-rich fraction is referred to as “starting material.” Immunoisolation was performed by a modification of the method of Howell et al. (14Howell K.E. Schmid R. Ugelstad J. Gruenberg J. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 31: 265-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, tosylated superparamagnetic beads (Dynabeads M-500, Dynal Inc., Oslo, Norway) were incubated overnight with a goat anti-rabbit IgG (Fc) linker secondary antibody (Biodesign International, Kennebunk, ME) at a concentration of 10 μg of antibody/mg of beads in borate buffer (100 mm H3BO3, pH 9.5). In this and all subsequent steps, beads were collected with a magnetic device (MPC; Dynal, Inc.). The amount of linker antibody that bound to the beads was reproducibly ∼5 μg/mg of beads. Coated Dynabeads were rotated for 12 h with a primary polyclonal antibody to AQP1 (10 μg/mg of beads) and 500 μg of purified microsome starting material. Control experiments were performed using Dynabeads coated with secondary anti-body alone. Beads were collected and rinsed with incubation buffer, and this immunoisolated fraction then represented the AQP1-containing vesicles specifically bound to the beads. Supernatant that remained after separation from the immunoisolated bound fraction was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 0.25 m sucrose, representing the unbound fraction. For simplicity, we refer to the microsome-rich fraction as “starting material,” the fraction containing the immunoisolated AQP1 vesicles attached to the beads as “bound,” and the supernatant containing non-AQP1-containing vesicles as “unbound.” These three fractions were subsequently analyzed biochemically and by immunoblotting. In a separate set of experiments aimed at determining the reversibility and specificity of the vesicle isolation technique, we used polyclonal antibodies to either CFTR or AE2 as the linking antibody to the coated immunomagnetic beads and thereby immunoisolated a population of CFTR-containing vesicles or AE2-containing vesicles, respectively, which were then analyzed biochemically and by immunoblotting. Characterization of Isolated Vesicles—Biochemical characterization using specific organelle assays was performed to determine the purity of the starting material prior to the immunoisolation protocol. To determine the specificity of the immunoisolation technique, the same assays were performed on both the bound and the unbound fractions.

Med. 1972; 136: 1117-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), malate dehydrogenase (mitochondria) activity (16Dupourque D. Kun E. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 13: 116-122Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar), lactate dehydrogenase (cytosol) activity (17Reeves W.J. Fimognari G.M. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 9: 288-289Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and alkaline phosphodiesterase 1 (plasma membrane) were assayed as previously reported (18Beaufay H.Y. Berthet J. J. Cell Biol. 1974; 61: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Microsome activity was determined by two methods: microsomal esterase, assessed by the method of Beaufay and Berthet (18Beaufay H.Y. Berthet J. J. Cell Biol. 1974; 61: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar), and glucose-6-phosphatase using a commercially available spectrophotometric kit from Sigma. Golgi activity was determined fluorometrically with the substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl-α-d-mannopyranoside, by the method of Farquhar (19Farquhar M.G. Bergeron J.J. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1974; 60: 8-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the fluorescamine method using bovine serum albumin as a standard (20Udenfriend S. Stein S. Bohlen P. Dairman W. Leimgruber W. Weigele M. Science. 1972; 178: 871-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2202) Google Scholar). As additional evidence of vesicle purity, solubilized fractions from the immunoisolation protocol were immunoblotted with specific antibodies to (i) calnexin (Affinity Bioreagents, Inc., Golden, CO), an integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum; (ii) TGN-38, a trans-Golgi network protein; and (iii) AQP4 (Alpha Diagnostics International, Inc., San Antonio, TX), a protein found in cholangiocytes exclusively in the basolateral plasma membrane. Vesicle suspensions were prepared for transmission electron microscopy using a primary fixative of 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 0.25 m sucrose for 1 h at 4 °C. A second and poststaining fixative consisting of 1% OsO4 and 1% uranyl acetate, respectively, was followed by dehydration in alcohol and embedding in Quetol as previously described (21Tietz P.S. Holman R.T. Miller L.J. LaRusso N.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15436-15443Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Electron micrographs were generated on a Phillips 201 electron microscope. Immunoblotting for AQP1, CFTR, and AE2—To determine the presence of AQP1, CFTR, and AE2 in the immunoisolated fractions, we performed immunoblotting using specific antibodies to AQP1 (Alpha Diagnostics International), CFTR (22Cohn J.A. Nairn A.C. Marino C.R. Melhus O. Kole J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2340-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and AE2. In a set of experiments designed to assess the specificity of the antibody for CFTR used for immunoblotting, we performed immunoblots for CFTR and AQP1 on cell lysates from cultured mouse cells obtained from a line of CFTR (-/-) knockout mice. In these immunoblots, the cell lysate was positive for AQP1 and negative for CFTR, demonstrating the specificity of the CFTR antibody (data not shown). Dual Labeled Immunogold for AQP1, CFTR, and AE2—Immortalized, nonmalignant mouse cholangiocytes (23Yahagi K. Ishii M. Kobayashi K. Ueno Y. Mano Y. Nitsuma H. Igarashi T. Toyota T. InVitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. 1998; 34: 512-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) were grown on type 1 collagen (Biocoat; Becton Dickinson, Bedford, MA) in culture media of minimal essential media (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1× penicillin/streptomycin. Confluent, polarized cholangiocytes were treated with media alone (basal) or media with the choleretic agonist, dibutyryl-cyclic AMP (100 μm), forskolin (3 μm), and isobutylmethylxanthine (100 μm) (to prevent the degradation of cAMP) for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were then processed for fixation and immunogold labeling according to the method of McCaffery and Farquhar (24McCaffery J. Farquhar M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 259-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and then exposed to primary antibodies to AQP1 (rabbit polyclonal) and CFTR (mouse monoclonal). Grids were then incubated with a mixture of donkey anti-rabbit IgG linked to 6-nm gold (AQP1) and donkey anti-mouse 12-nm gold (CFTR) and examined with a Joel 1200 electron microscope at 80 kV. Electron micrographs from both basal and agonist groups were printed at a final magnification of ×30,000, and pictures were randomized for counting. Vesicles were quantified in four groups: (i) vesicles containing only 6-nm gold particles, representing specific labeling for AQP1; (ii) vesicles containing only 12-nm gold particles, labeled for CFTR; (iii) vesicles labeling for both AQP1 and CFTR; and (iv) vesicles without any labeling. In a parallel experiment, vesicles were exposed to 5-nm gold particles labeled for AE2 and 10-nm gold particles labeled for CFTR. The same criteria used to quantitate the associated gold particles for AQP1 and CFTR was used as described for AE2 and CFTR. The micrographs represent photographs from six grids from each of three different vesicle preparations. Micrographs were counted randomly in each group and counted three times to obtain means ± S.E. Data are expressed as the number of gold particles in each group as a percentage of the total. Animal Model for in Vivo Experiments—In vivo experiments were performed using rats in which the common bile duct was ligated for 1 week (8Garcia F. Kierbel A. Larocca C. Gradilone S. Splinter P. LaRusso N.F. Marinelli R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12147-12152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). After the biliary obstruction was released, 1.0 ml of 10-7m secretin (Peninsula Laboratories, Belmont, CA) or vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4) was administered via the femoral vein. In separate experiments, BDL rats were injected intravenously with 0.5 μmol/100 g of body weight colchicine or β-lumicolchicine in phosphate-buffered saline 2 h prior to administration of secretin. Bile was collected, and cholangiocytes were isolated immediately after secretin administration as previously described (6Marinelli R.A. Tietz P.S. Pham L.D. Rueckert L. Agre P. LaRusso N.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G280-G286PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoblotting experiments, apical and basolateral plasma membranes were prepared from isolated cholangiocytes derived from whole liver as previously described by us (21Tietz P.S. Holman R.T. Miller L.J. LaRusso N.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15436-15443Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Densitometric scanning was performed using the software Molecular Analyst (Bio-Rad). All values are expressed as mean ± S.E. Significance was determined using Student's t test; p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Characterization of AQP1-containing Vesicles—Shown in Fig. 1A are electron micrographs confirming that the vesicles immunoisolated with an antibody to AQP1 specifically attach to magnetic beads coated with this antibody. In the top panel, numerous vesicle-like structures can be seen attached to the surface of a magnetic bead coated with AQP1 antibody. In the lower panel, no such structures are seen when control beads coated only with the secondary, non-AQP1 antibody were used. Fig. 1B displays results of immunoblots for proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum (calnexin), Golgi (TGN-38), plasma membrane (AQP4), and AQP1. Calnexin, TGN-38, and AQP4 were detected at their expected molecular weights and in their respective positive controls but were absent from the bound fraction. AQP1 was present at 28 kDa in the positive control of rat RBC plasma membrane and in the microsome and bound fractions. Table I shows a biochemical analysis of the microsomal starting material, the fraction bound to the immunomagnetic beads, and the unbound fraction. As expected, the microsomal derived starting material showed an enrichment in activity of the microsomal markers, microsomal esterase, and glucose-6-phosphatase; enzyme activities for lysosomes, mitochondria, and plasma membranes were undetectable, demonstrating that the starting material did not contain these organelles. The amounts of measurable lactate dehydrogenase (cytosolic marker) and α-d-mannopyranoside (Golgi marker) were negligible.Table IBiochemical analysis of AQP1 vesicle preparationOrganelleActivityPNSaPostnuclear supernatantStarting materialbStarting material represents a purified microsomal fractionBoundUnboundunits/mg proteinLysosomesβ-Glucosaminidase2.3 ± 0.07UDcUD, undetectableUDUDMitochondriaMalate dehydrogenase0.75 ± 0.06UDUDUDCystosolLactate dehydrogenase3.6 ± 0.850.23 ± 0.030.11 ± 0.020.08 ± 0.02MicrosomesMicrosomal esterase1.9 ± 0.2210.4 ± 1.76.7 ± 1.95.4 ± 2.1Glucose-6-phosphatase0.74 ± 0.0911.6 ± 2.13.1 ± 0.84.7 ± 1.6Golgiα-d-Mannopyranoside3.1 ± 0.430.52 ± 0.050.07 ± 0.0020.21 ± 0.01Plasma membraneAlkaline phosphodiesterase 14.3 ± 5.1UDUDUDa Postnuclear supernatantb Starting material represents a purified microsomal fractionc UD, undetectable Open table in a new tab Immunoblotting of Isolated Subcellular Fractions—The immunoblot shown in Fig. 2A illustrates that AQP1, CFTR, and AE2 were all significantly (p < 0.05) enriched in the bead-associated AQP1-immunoisolated vesicles compared with the microsomal preparation: AQP1, 2.4-fold; CFTR, 1.7-fold; AE2, 2.8-fold. There was virtually no detectable AQP1, CFTR, or AE2 in the lanes loaded with an equal amount of protein from the unbound fraction. Fig. 2, B and C, shows the results of immunoblotting for AQP1, CFTR, and AE2 on fractions from the reverse immunoisolations using antibodies to CFTR to isolate CFTR-containing vesicles (B) or antibodies to AE2 to isolate AE2-containing vesicles (C). In vesicles isolated with the antibody to CFTR (B), the bound fractions were significantly (p < 0.05) enriched 3.2-fold over the starting material for CFTR, 2.5-fold for AQP1, and 2.7-fold for AE2. In vesicles isolated with the antibody to AE2 (C), the bound fractions were significantly (p < 0.05) enriched 3.4-fold over the starting material for AE2, 2.6-fold for AQP1, and 2.5-fold for CFTR. Fig. 3, A and B, illustrates colocalization in two sets of dual labeled immunogold experimental combinations (AQP1 with CFTR (top) and AE2 with CFTR (bottom)). Our observations revealed populations of small beads alone (6-nm gold for AQP1 and AE2), large beads alone (12-nm gold for CFTR), and clusters of colocalized small and large beads together shown in the enlarged insets. Quantitation revealed that AQP1 and CFTR and AE2 and CFTR colocalized in 25 and 34%, respectively, of the total vesicles counted (Fig 3, A1 and B1). Following agonist stimulation (Fig. 4), we observed relocation of the gold particles to the apical plasma membrane (Fig. 4, A1 and B1) compared with the basal state (Fig 4, A and B), consistent with our previous biochemical and morphologic data. Since the normal mouse cholangiocytes were grown in a polarized confluent manner prior to fixation, we concluded that the agonist-induced migration is domain-specific. Quantitation of the gold particles (Fig. 4, C and D) revealed a significant 2-fold or greater increase in the apical membrane-associated redistribution. In addition, the apical membrane-associated labeling contains numerous clusters of small and large gold particles, implying that the transporters may remain associated after agonist-induced redistribution to the apical membrane. Statistical analysis was performed on the quantitation of gold particles in the basal state according to the Kullback-Liebler hypothesized model of randomness (26Bishop Y.M.M. Fienberg S.E. Holland P.W. Discrete Multivariate Analysis: Theory and Practice. MIT Press, Boston, MA1975: 344-346Google Scholar, 27Cole T.J. Stat. Med. 2000; 19: 3109-3125Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) to assess “degree of association” between AQP1 and CFTR and between AE2 and CFTR in an effort to minimize the possibility that the apparent colocalization of the immunogold beads was a random event. Hypothetically, the proportions of vesicles with small gold beads only, large beads only, and both small and large beads should all be equal to 1/3. To measure the departure from randomness for each reading from a given micrograph, the Kullback-Liebler distance was computed. A calculated κ value of <0.05 indicates a significant departure from randomness. The measured κ value of the colocalized AQP1/CFTR and AE2/CFTR was 0.031 and 0.030, respectively, supporting our interpretation that the observed colocalization of small and large beads was not a random event.Fig. 4Polarized confluent mouse cholangiocytes were exposed to media alone (basal) (A and B) or media with dibutyryl-cAMP (agonist) (A1 and B1). Agonist stimulation caused a redistribution of dual labeled immunogold and demonstrates a consistent and significant movement of vesicles containing colocalized AQP1 with CFTR and AE2 with CFTR to the apical plasma membrane (arrowheads). Quantitation of the apical membrane-associated labeling (C and D) revealed a significant 2-fold or greater increase in the apical membrane-associated redistribution.

In the unstimulated state, any AQP1 in the plasma membrane is present principally in the apical domain. Following intravenous infusion of 10-7m secretin into BDL rats, which causes a 2–4-fold increase in bile secretion (Fig. 5C), the total amount of AQP1 is increased in both the band representing total plasma membrane and in the apical domain by 2.4- and 2.2-fold, respectively, relative to membranes isolated from rats infused with vehicle alone. Immunoblots for CFTR and AE2 were performed on the same fractions of total plasma membranes as well as fractions enriched in the apical and basolateral plasma membrane domains. In the absence of an intravenous infusion of secretin (i.e. vehicle infusion), total plasma membrane CFTR and AE2 are predominantly apical in their location. Following IV infusion of secretin, the amount of CFTR and AE2 in plasma membranes, like AQP1, also increases 3.8-fold in the total plasma membrane and 2.4-fold in the apical plasma membrane. We next employed the microtubule blocker colchicine, which we had previously shown inhibits secretin-induced bile flow (6Marinelli R.A. Tietz P.S. Pham L.D. Rueckert L. Agre P. LaRusso N.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G280-G286PubMed Google Scholar). These data are shown again in Fig. 5C for the purpose of correlating secretin-induced changes in bile flow with the blocked increase in movement to the plasma membrane of AQP1, CFTR, and AE2. As shown in Fig. 5B, pretreatment of rats with colchicine, followed by administration of secretin, nearly abolished the increase of AQP1, CFTR, and AE2 in cholangiocyte plasma membranes. The inactive analog, β-lumicolchicine, did not affect the action of secretin on AQP1, CFTR, and AE2 membrane distribution or bile flow compared with rats receiving no treatment. This is the first report to our knowledge suggesting that cholangiocytes contain agonist-responsive specialized organelles in which functionally related proteins involved in water and ion transport are sequestered. Using independent and complementary biochemical and morphologic techniques, we found that (i) in the unstimulated or basal state, AQP1, CFTR, and AE2 colocalize to an intracellular vesicular compartment in cholangiocytes, and (ii) after exposure of cholangiocytes to dibutyryl-cAMP in vitro or after secretin infusion in vivo, AQP1, CFTR, and AE2 redistribute together to the apical cholangiocyte plasma membrane, an event that is blocked by the microtubule inhibitor, colchicine. The data are consistent with the notion that secretin, by interacting with specific cAMP-coupled receptors on the basolateral domain of cholangiocytes, induces microtubule-dependent movement of vesicles containing AQP1, CFTR, and AE2 and exocytic insertion of these functionally related flux proteins into the apical plasma membrane domain. Increased CFTR trafficked to the secretory pole of cholangiocytes would facilitate active secretion of Cl-, driving HCO3− secretion into the ductal lumen by AE2, resulting in passive movement of water through AQP1 and net ductal bile secretion. We used immunoisolation to prepare a subpopulation of vesicles from cholangiocytes that were enriched in AQP1, CFTR, and AE2. The degree of enrichment we observed in the immunoisolated fraction seems reasonable given that our starting material is a purified microsomal fraction rather than a postnuclear supernatant. Moreover, using three different antibodies, we achieved the same relative degree of enrichment of the three proteins in the immunoisolated fraction. In comparably designed studies to immunoisolate endothelial plasmalemmal vesicles, the caveolin fraction that bound to the magnetic beads was enriched 4–5-fold compared with a more crude starting material of whole rat lung (25Oh P. Schnitzer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23144-23154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In addition, the antibodies and proteins in the isolation and wash buffer (required for the immunopurification) adhere to the beads and cause an important underestimation of actual enrichment. The concept that transporters for water and ions reside in the same vesicle in cholangiocytes is teleologically appealing, since water moves passively in response to osmotic gradients established by active Cl--driven HCO3− secretion, the currently accepted paradigm of ductal bile formation. These transient gradients are thought to be established by the transport of bicarbonate via the Cl−/HCO3− exchanger located in the apical cholangiocyte membrane and operating in parallel with the CFTR chloride channel. Recently published observations, (3Raeder M.G. Curr. Opin. Gastroenterol. 1995; 11: 439-444Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 5Marinelli R.A. LaRusso N.F.

Gastroenterology. 1995; 109: 1600-1611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and those reported here support the notion that a secretin-induced increase in cholangiocyte cAMP both triggers the exocytic insertion of AQP1 into the cholangiocyte apical membrane and activates apical CFTR chloride channels. Previously published data from our laboratory have demonstrated that exposure of highly purified isolated rat cholangiocytes to secretin caused significant, dose-dependent increases in osmotic membrane water permeability (Pf) (e.g. increased by 60% with 10-7m secretin), which was reversibly inhibited by the water channel blocker, mercuric chloride (5Marinelli R.A. LaRusso N.F. Hepatology. 1997; 26: 1081-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence exist that support the colocalization of water with ion transporters or other regulators of exocytosis, based on data generated in the tubule cells of the kidney using techniques of immunblotting and immunostaining. These include SNAP-25-associated Hrs-2 colocalizing with AQP2 (11Shukla A. Hager H. Corydon T.J. Bean A.J. Dahl R. Vajda Z. Li H. Hoffman H.J. Nielsen S. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 281: F546-F556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), AQP2 with VAMP2 (10Acher R. Ann. Endocrinol. 2002; 63: 197-218PubMed Google Scholar), and AQP2 with CFTR and the amiloride-sensitive epithelial Na+ channel (EnaC) (9Biner H.L. Arpin-Bott M.P. Loffing J. Wang X. Knepper M. Hebert S.C. Kaissling B. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 836-847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence for the cAMP-mediated stimulation of apical targeting of vesicles containing flux molecules has been shown not only by us for AQP1 in cholangiocytes but also in a number of other epithelia, including in T84 colonocytes for CFTR and in kidney tubule epithelia for AQP2 (28Boyer J.L.

Physiol. 1995; 268: C1546-C1551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been reported that secretin stimulates Cl−/HCO3− exchange in isolated cholangiocytes (33Alvaro D. Cho W.K. Mennone A. Boyer J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1314-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and increases CFTR in the apical membrane of pancreatic duct cells via cAMP (34O'Reilly C.M. Winpenny J.P. Argent B.E. Gray M.A. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 1187-1196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The last three amino acids in the COOH terminus of CFTR (TRL) comprise a PDZ-interacting domain that appears to be required for the targeting of CFTR to the apical plasma membrane in human airway and kidney epithelial cells (35Moyer B.D. Denton J. Karlson K.H. Reynolds D. Wang S. Mickle J.E. Milewski M. Cutting G.R. Guggino W.B. Li M. Stanton B.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1353-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been proposed that CFTR and its PDZ proteins in concert with ezrin affect other epithelial ion channels in their movement to a subapical compartment (35Moyer B.D. Denton J. Karlson K.H. Reynolds D. Wang S. Mickle J.E. Milewski M. Cutting G.R. Guggino W.B. Li M. Stanton B.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1353-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Since AQP1 does not contain a known apical targeting signal, colocalization of AQP1 in a vesicle with CFTR would provide a plausible mechanism explaining how AQP1 can redistribute to the apical cholangiocyte plasma membrane in response to a secretory agonist. In kidney collecting tubule cells, AQP2 colocalizes with VAMP1 and -2, and these proteins are all trafficked to the apical plasma membrane in response to vasopressin (36Nielsen S. Marples D. Birn H. Mohtashami M. Dalby N.O. Trimble M. Knepper M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1834-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Thus, the model of agonist-driven, polarized targeting and insertion of flux proteins into specific plasma membrane domains of secretory epithelia has precedent. Our immunogold data provide additional evidence for the colocalization of AQP1, AE2, and CFTR and are reminiscent of the work of Nielsen et al. (36Nielsen S. Marples D. Birn H. Mohtashami M. Dalby N.O. Trimble M. Knepper M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1834-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), who demonstrated dual labeling and colocalization of AQP2 with VAMP2. The apparent increase in membrane-associated vesicles containing only AQP1, which was greater than the individual increases of CFTR alone and AE2 alone, may indicate the presence of specific signal or target proteins on the plasma membrane that are selective to AQP1 and not CFTR or AE2. Alternatively, the vesicles containing both flux proteins may fuse with the plasma membrane where the proteins are subsequently sorted independently, causing a difference in the net number of gold particles remaining on the membrane at the time of fixation. Whether these functionally related flux proteins are also retrieved together upon withdrawal of the secretory stimulus or in response to a cholestatic stimulus (e.g. somatostatin) remains to be elucidated. Data generated using the model of isolated bile duct units from AQP1-ko mice were interpreted as suggesting that AQPs may not be rate-limiting for transcellular water movement in biliary epithelia; interpretation of these data should also include the possibility that up-regulation of other AQPs that we have shown are present in cholangiocytes may compensate for the absence of AQP1 in cholangiocytes (37Mennone A. Verkman A.S. Boyer J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: G739-G746Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, although recycling as a regulatory mechanism for epithelial cell transport is an accepted paradigm, our work here substantially extends this concept by introducing the novel notion that a single intracellular hormone-responsive vesicular compartment might contain several proteins that are linked both anatomically and functionally in an integrated fashion to accomplish a cellular process, in this case coupled water and electrolyte secretion. Our in vivo observation that administration of the microtubule depolymerizing agent, colchicine, inhibited the secretin-induced increase of AQP1, AE2, and CFTR in the cholangiocyte plasma membrane as well as secretin-induced ductal bile secretion is consistent with studies in kidney-proximal tubule cells, showing that microtubules are required for insertion of AQP1 into the plasma membrane (38Elkjaer M.L. Birn H. Agre P. Christensen E.I. Nielsen S. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 67: 57-72PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the extension of our observations to this in vivo situation provides additional evidence in a more physiologically relevant model that the molecular events we describe are important in ductal bile secretion. It seems plausible that defects or alterations in the coordinated trafficking of related proteins could be responsible for a variety of diseases. For example, it has been reported that both message and protein expression of the Cl−/HCO3− exchanger is diminished in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, a disease in which the cholangiocyte is the target cell (39Prieto J. Qian C. Garcia N. Diez J. Medina J.F. Gastroenterology. 1993; 105: 572-578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The secretion of bicarbonate into bile is strongly linked to increased efflux of chloride into the lumen and the conductance of apical CFTR (40Colombo C. Battezzati P. Strazzabosco M. Podda M. Semin. Liver Dis. 1998; 18: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Moreover, the aquaporin family of water channel proteins also include mutations and abnormalities in transport that may result in nephrogenic diabetes insipidis (AQP2) (41Deen P.M. Verdijk M.A. Knoers N.V. Science. 1994; 264: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar), cataracts (AQP0) (42Berry V. Francis P. Kaushal S. Moore A. Bhattacharya S. Nat.

Agre P. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 345: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the data presented in this study, together with our previous observations (5Marinelli R.A. LaRusso N.F. Hepatology. 1997; 26: 1081-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 6Marinelli R.A. Tietz P.S. Pham L.D. Rueckert L. Agre P. LaRusso N.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G280-G286PubMed Google Scholar), support our proposed molecular model of ductal bile secretion. The model is now extended by the proposed existence of a biochemically and morphologically characterized novel transporting organelle in cholangiocytes that appears to contain proteins for water and chloride transport, flux proteins that play integral roles in hormone-induced ductal bile secretion. Clearly, additional studies will be necessary to fully elucidate the quantitative relevance of our observations to total bile formation.

Structural data from several PLC homologs suggests that PLC-β isozymes possess a modular domain architecture containing an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain adjacent to calcium-binding EF hand domains, followed by the catalytic αβ barrel domain, connected to a C2 domain, terminating with a C-terminal coiled-coil helical domain (14Heinz D.W.

Whereas the C-terminal region unique to PLC-β isozymes is required for engaging Gαq (18Paulssen R.H. Woodson J. Liu Z. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26622-26629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the binding surface of Gβγ is less clear. Conflicting reports document the PH domain, a portion of the putative EF hands, and a region within the catalytic domain of PLC-β as important for recognizing Gβγ (19Kuang Y.N. Wu Y.Q. Smrcka A.

Both myristolated Gαq and isoprenylated Gβγ independently regulate PLC-β at cellular membranes (24Runnels L.W. Scarlata S.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1488-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), where PLC-β engages its phosphoinositide substrate, PtdIns(4,5)P2. Interestingly, PH domains from many proteins bind phosphoinositide membrane lipids (25Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar), and for the case of PLC-δ, the PH domain recruits the enzyme to the lipid bilayer via specific interactions with PtdIns(4,5)P2 (26Garcia P. Gupta R. Shah S. Morris A.J. Rudge S.A. Scarlata S. Petrova V. McLaughlin S. Rebecchi M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16228-16234Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Thus, whereas PLC-β isozymes are soluble in aqueous solution, their regulation and catalytic function are intimately linked with membrane-associated heterotrimeric G protein subunits and particular membrane compositions, including specific lipid rafts (27Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7092-7099Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The tacit assumption that inositol lipid signaling is solely regulated by heterotrimeric G proteins has grossly underestimated the complexity of PLC-β-related signaling. Illenberger et al. (28Illenberger D. Schwald F. Pimmer D. Binder W. Maier G. Dietrich A. Gierschik P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6241-6249Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 29Illenberger D. Walliser C. Nurnberg B. Diaz Lorente M. Gierschik P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3006-3014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) have identified several members of the Rho family of small GTPases (Cdc42, Rac1, and Rac2) that stimulate PLC-β-catalyzed inositol phosphate production. Rho GTPases comprise a major branch of the Ras superfamily of GTPases, and these oncogenic molecular switches are best known for their capacity to direct the organization of the actin cytoskeleton (30Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5216) Google Scholar, 31Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3839) Google Scholar). Regulation of PLC-β by Rho GTPases appears to utilize portions of PLC-β distinct from regions involved in promoting Gαq and Gβγ signaling (29Illenberger D. Walliser C. Nurnberg B. Diaz Lorente M. Gierschik P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3006-3014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Rac2 also regulates the membrane association of PLC-β2 (32Illenberger D. Walliser C. Strobel J. Gutman O. Niv H. Gaidzik V. Kloog Y. Gierschik P. Henis Y.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8645-8652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and a lipase-competent chimera of the putative PH domain of PLC-β1 with the remaining portion of PLC-β2 failed to respond to Rac stimulation and membrane recruitment (29Illenberger D. Walliser C. Nurnberg B. Diaz Lorente M. Gierschik P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3006-3014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The spectra of Rho GTPases that stimulate PLC-β have not yet been defined. Moreover, whether Rho proteins and PLC-β isozymes interact via direct protein-protein interactions, and which portions of PLC-β are required for this activation are not yet known. To investigate the mechanism of activation of PLC-β by Rho GTPases, a biosensor screen was developed to audition the Rho family GTPases for their capacity to directly recognize various full-length and truncated fragments of PLC-β isozymes. This analysis reveals that PLC-β2 and PLC-β3 possess remarkable specificity for only the Rac members of the Rho family of GTPases, and these detected interactions are strictly dependent upon the activated, GTP-bound state of Rac. Importantly, the PH domain of PLC-β2 is sufficient to engage Rac GTPases in an identical, nucleotide-specific manner with similar affinity. Thus, our findings quantify the direct interactions between PLC-β isozymes and Rac GTPases and redefine the role of the PH domain of PLC-β2 as fully competent to bind activated Rac GTPases. Protein Production—The coding sequences for all known human Rho family GTPases (Fig. 1A) were amplified by PCR and ligated into NcoI/XhoI-digested pProExHTa. With the exception of RhoBTB1 and RhoBTB2, all Rho GTPase constructs were terminated at the site of C-terminal isoprenylation and substituted with serine for the cysteine normally isoprenylated. For the multidomain RhoBTB1 and RhoBTB2 proteins, only the putative Rho GTPase portions (residues 1–247) were produced. Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) cells were grown in LB broth until mid-log phase, and Rho proteins were induced from the pProExHTa vector with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at either 30 °C for 6 h or 22 °C for 12 h. The soluble portion of the cellular lysate from each culture was applied to nickel-charged chelating Sepharose resin (Amersham Biosciences), and recombinant proteins were purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. Fractions rich in soluble, purified GTPase were dialyzed overnight against 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 5 mm MgCl2 and stored at -80 °C until needed. Guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPγS) was loaded into GTPases as noted by incubation with 2 mm EDTA and a 10-fold molar excess of GTPγS (Sigma) for 30 min at 22 °C, before the above-mentioned dialysis step. PCR-amplified fragments of the cDNAs encoding the PH domains of human PLC-β2 (residues 1–144) and rat PLC-δ (residues 11–140) were subcloned into pProExHTa, expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) cells until mid-log phase, and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3–5 h at 37 °C. PLC-δ PH domain was purified similar to the above-described Rho GTPase purification. PLC-β2 PH domain was extracted from the pellet fraction of cellular lysate using 8 m urea, purified via immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography in 8 m urea, and eluted with an imidazole gradient in 8 m urea. Purified, unfolded PLC-β2 PH domain was slowly dripped into 2 liters of 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 500 mm l-arginine at 4 °C. Soluble, folded, monomeric PLC-β2 PH domain was then isolated over a Sephacryl-200 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol and subsequently loaded onto Source S resin (Amersham Biosciences) in 20 mm MES (pH 6.0), 50 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient. The resulting purified PLC-β2 PH domain is soluble at 20 mg/ml and, upon digestion of the His6 tag with tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease, readily crystallizes in 100 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm sodium acetate, and 20% polyethylene glycol 4000. The bacterial expression plasmid (pET28a) encoding the cDNA for the PH domain of β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 (residues 548–641, with six C-terminal histidines) was a generous gift from A. Bohm. β-Adrenergic receptor kinase 1 PH domain was produced and purified by a method similar to that used for the Rho GTPase purification. cDNAs for the coding regions of human Gαq (residues 7–360), Gβ1γ2 subunits (β1 = full-length, γ2 = residues 1–68), and full-length human PLC-β1, PLC-β2, and PLC-β3 were amplified by PCR and ligated into pFastBacHT. Baculovirus isolates were prepared following the Bac-to-Bac method (Invitrogen). Recombinant protein was expressed in High-Five insect cells for 48 h at 27 °C after infection with virus. Gβ1 and Gγ2 baculovirus were co-infected at a molar ratio of unity. The resulting Gαq and the Gγ2 polypeptides lack their known sites of post-translational modification. Insect cell-produced recombinant proteins were lysed using an Emulsi-Flex C5 (Avestin), extracted with 0.5% N-octyl-β-gluco-pyranoside, purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography as described above for the Rho GTPases, and cleaved with TEV protease until the His6 tag was completely removed. Proteins were further purified using the above-described gel exclusion and ion exchange purification steps used for the PH domain of PLC-β2. The PH-C2 portion of PLC-β2 (residues 1–801) is a proteolytic fragment of full-length PLC-β2 protein that has been previously purified and characterized by others (29Illenberger D. Walliser C. Nurnberg B. Diaz Lorente M. Gierschik P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3006-3014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). PLC-β2 PH-C2 was purified to homogeneity in a manner identical to that used for full-length PLC-β2, except that no protease inhibitors were added. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass-spectral analysis from the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill Proteomics core facility revealed the boundary limits of the PH-C2 protein. The C-terminal domain (residues 871–1151) of PLC-β2 has been characterized previously (17Singer A.U. Waldo G.L. Harden T.K. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Fluorescence-based Nucleotide Exchange Assay—Verification of GTP loading by each recombinant Rho GTPase was accomplished using a previously described assay (33Snyder J.T. Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Betts L. Pruitt W.M. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μm Rho GTPase was incubated with 200 nmN-methylanthraniloyl-GTP (Biomol) for 300 s, and the change in relative fluorescence upon addition of 10 mm EDTA was monitored with a SpectraMax Gemini (Molecular Devices) at λex = 360 nm, and λem = 440 nm. All soluble recombinant Rho GTPases displayed at least a 3-fold increase in the rate of nucleotide loading upon addition of EDTA. Surface Plasmon Resonance—Rho GTPase binding was monitored using surface plasmon resonance with a BIAcore3000 (Biacore), at 25 °C, with flow rates of 20–25 μl/min, using Hepes-buffered saline with polysorbate 20 (supplemented with 5 mm MgCl2). For each experiment, equivalent immobilized protein surfaces were achieved for each flow cell on CM5 sensor chips (Biacore) by first activating each flow cell with an injection of a 1:1 mix of NHS/EDC. Each protein was captured on individual flow cells using injections of 0.2 mg/ml protein solutions followed by an injection of 1 m ethanolamine to block remaining active surface groups as described previously (34Day Y.S. Baird C.L. Rich R.L. Myszka D.G. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1017-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). For the screening of Rho GTPases, 8000–10,000 response units of proteins were attached to each sensor surface, whereas lower surface densities (1000–1500 response units) were created for the titration studies. Rho GTPases were injected in a random order over the sensor surfaces using kinjects of 20–35 μl, with buffer flowed over the sensor chip to promote dissociation of each GTPase with dissociation times extending to 1000 s. Rho GTPase proteins routinely completely dissociated from each sensor surface as judged by the stable response unit levels maintained for each flow cell over the course of the experiments. Thus, to preserve the integrity of the covalently immobilized proteins, no regeneration steps were performed. Unless noted, all sensorgrams were always normalized to the signal achieved due to binding a control “blank” flow cell surface. For kinetic evaluations, sensorgrams from each set of titrations were aligned, and the normalized data were globally fit to a 1:1 binding model (RI = 0) with BIAevaluation 3.2 software (Biacore). Resulting thermodynamic constants are the result of three independent sets of titrations. Phospholipid binding was measured using a Biacore 2000 in a manner similar to the description above, with the following noted exceptions. Phospholipids were purchased from Biomol, dissolved in a 1:1 chloroform/methanol solution, dried under a nitrogen stream, and resuspended in Hepes-buffered saline (Biacore) by sonication. His6-tagged PLC-β2 PH domain was attached to a CM5 chip (Biacore) coated with covalently attached anti-penta-histidine antibody (Qiagen) and washed with buffer to remove nonspecific binding before phospholipid injections were performed. Between lipid injections, the PLC-β2 PH domain surface was regenerated with a pulse of 1 m imidazole before immobilizing fresh protein. COS-7 Cell Transfections and Phospholipase C-β Activity Measurements—pcDNA3.1 vectors (Invitrogen) encoding Rho GTPases activated with a G12V mutation and fused to hemagglutinin tags were obtained from the Guthrie cDNA Resource Center. Gβ1, Gγ2, and Gαq pcDNA vectors have been described previously (35Blake B.L. Wing M.R. Zhou J.Y. Lei Q. Hillmann J.R. Behe C.I. Morris R.A. Harden T.K. Bayliss D.A. Miller R.J. Siderovski D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49267-49274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were seeded in 12-well culture dishes at a density of ∼60,000 cells/well and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 90% air/10% CO2. The indicated DNA vectors were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) transfection reagent (3 μl FuGENE 6/1 μg DNA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Six hundred ng total DNA/well was transfected, with empty vector added as necessary to maintain an equal amount of DNA for each well. Approximately 24 h after transfection, media were removed and replaced with myo-[3H]inositol (1 μCi/well) in inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After 12 h, [3H]inositol phosphate accumulation was initiated by addition of LiCl to a final concentration of 10 mm. The reaction was stopped after 1 h by aspiration of the medium and addition of 50 mm formic acid followed by neutralization with 150 mm NH4OH. [3H]Inositol phosphates were quantified by Dowex chromatography as described previously (36Brown H.A. Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 648-655PubMed Google Scholar). Biosensor GTPase Screen—To define the spectrum of Rho family GTPases that directly bind PLC-β isozymes, 17 recombinant Rho GTPases were produced and purified (Fig. 1, A and B). Each purified GTPase is indeed functional because these Rho proteins all exhibit the capacity to load guanine nucleotides (see “Experimental Procedures”) (37Remmers A.E. Posner R. Neubig R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13771-13778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, the integrity of the Cdc42 protein was further validated by demonstrating that intersectin, a known Cdc42-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor, but not Tiam1, a Rac1-specific exchange factor, will stimulate removal of bound nucleotide within Cdc42 as described previously (33Snyder J.T. Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Betts L. Pruitt W.M. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Full-length PLC-β1, PLC-β2, and PLC-β3 were immobilized to individual flow cells on a Biacore CM5 sensor chip as a means to identify GTPases that directly interact with PLC-β isozymes using surface plasmon resonance (Fig. 1C). To verify the integrity of each immobilized PLC-β surface, we demonstrated that, as reported previously (24Runnels L.W. Scarlata S.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1488-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), an active form of Gαq (GDP + AlF4), but not inactive Gαq (GDP), specifically binds to each PLC-β isozyme (Fig. 1D). For each Rho GTPase displayed in Fig. 1B, both the active (GTPγS-loaded) and inactive (GDP-loaded) states were screened for binding to each PLC-β surface (Fig. 1E). Surprisingly, only GTPγS-loaded Rac GTPases (Rac1, Rac2, and Rac3), but no other tested Rho protein, displayed differential binding to the PLC-β surfaces compared with a blank control surface. Moreover, the activated Rac GTPases, but not the GDP-loaded forms, exhibited an observed specificity for PLC-β2 and PLC-β3, with no detectable binding to PLC-β1 (Fig. 1F). These data suggest that Rac1, Rac2, and Rac3, but not other members of the highly conserved Rho family of GTPases, can directly interact with PLC-β isozymes in a nucleotide-specific manner. In Vivo PLC-β2Stimulation by Rac GTPases—The capacity of Rac GTPases to specifically stimulate PLC-β2-catalyzed inositol phosphate formation in COS-7 cells was next evaluated (Fig. 2). As expected, increasing amounts of cDNA for Gαq (Fig. 2A) and Gβ1γ2 (Fig. 2B) both stimulated inositol phosphate accumulation, but only after co-transfection with PLC-β2. Significantly, and in a fashion consistent with our surface plasmon resonance biosensor screen, constitutively active GTPase-deficient Rac1 (Fig. 2C), Rac2 (Fig. 2D), and Rac3 (Fig. 2E) G12V mutants (38Krengel U. Schlichting L. Scherer A. Schumann R. Frech M. John J. Kabsch W. Pai E.F. Wittinghofer A. Cell. 1990; 62: 539-548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) considerably enhanced the lipase activity of PLC-β2. In contrast, constitutively active Cdc42 (G12V) failed to stimulate detectable inositol phosphate accumulation (Fig. 2F) despite being expressed to significant levels. These data indicate that the capacity of Rac GTPases to stimulate PLC-β2 activity in vivo is not shared by Cdc42 and are consistent with the lack of observable binding between Cdc42 and the PLC-β isozymes tested using surface plasmon resonance. Quantification of Affinities between Rac GTPases and PLC-β Isozymes—To quantify interactions between recombinant Rac GTPases and PLC-β2 and PLC-β3, a concentration series of each Rac GTPase (loaded with GTPγS) was injected across the immobilized PLC-β isozyme surfaces using Biacore technology (Fig. 3, A and B). The resulting sensorgrams display concentration-dependent binding events between the Rac GTPases and PLC-β2 and PLC-β3. To estimate the dissociation constants for these interactions, the steady state equilibrium responses (Req) were plotted against Rac concentration and fit to simple binding isotherms (39Myszka D.G. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3C). As displayed in Table I, Rac1, Rac2, and Rac3 each bind PLC-β2 (KD = 5–10 μm) with greater affinity than PLC-β3 (KD > 25 μm) and display no detectable binding to PLC-β1 at concentrations of up to 50 μm GTPase.Table IDissociation constants for the Rac-GTPγS/PLC-β interactionsPLC-β1PLC-β2PLC-β3PLC-β2 PH-C2PLC-β2 PHPLC-β2 CTRac1NB5.3 ± 5.630 ± 1116 ± 5.313 ± 6.7NBRac2NB7.0 ± 1.958 ± 2.117 ± 8.411 ± 5.4NBRac3NB9.3 ± 5.688 ± 1.414 ± 1018 ± 11NB Open table in a new tab Phosphoinositide Binding by the PLC-β2PH Domain—Previous studies implicate the PH domain of PLC-β2 as important for Rac-mediated stimulation of PLC-β2 (29Illenberger D.

Thus, we produced and assessed the functional properties of the isolated PH domain of PLC-β2. Because the most attributed biochemical function of PH domains is their capacity to bind phosphoinositides (25Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar), the lipid binding properties of the PLC-β2 PH domain were examined using micelles composed of individual phospholipids. Significantly, the PLC-β2 PH domain preferably bound PtdIns(4,5)P2 and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate over other negatively charged membrane lipids, phosphatidylinositol and dipalmitoyl phosphatidylserine (Fig. 4A). Therefore, as observed for the majority of the previously characterized PH domains (40Kavran J.M. Klein D.E. Lee A. Falasca M. Isakoff S.J. Skolnik E.Y. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30497-30508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), the PLC-β2 PH domain promiscuously binds various phosphoinositides with no significant binding to other phospholipids. The estimated dissociation constant is ∼15 μm for the interaction of PtdIns(4,5)P2 and the PH domain of PLC-β2 (Fig. 4B). These data indicate that the refolded PH domain from PLC-β2 is biochemically functional and suitable as a target for assessing the binding of Rho GTPases. Rac GTPase Binding by the PLC-β2PH Domain—To define the region of PLC-β that is sufficient to recognize activated Rac GTPases, several soluble fragments of PLC-β2 were generated (Fig. 5A). These include the C-terminal domain, a fragment spanning the PH and C2 domains, and the above-mentioned isolated PH domain. The capacity of the PLC-β2 fragments to recognize Rac GTPases was analyzed via surface plasmon resonance. Whereas the C-terminal fragment of PLC-β2 did not bind any of the Rho GTPases from our recombinant library, the isolated PH domain and the PH-C2 protein both mimicked the binding characteristics of full-length PLC-β2 by interacting with GTPγS-loaded Rac GTPases (Fig. 5B), but not with GTPγS-loaded RhoA (Fig. 5C) or any of the other screened Rho proteins (Fig. 1B). Titration experiments revealed that the PH domain and the PH-C2 proteins bound Rac-GTPγS isoforms (KD =10–20 μm) with affinities comparable to the full-length PLC-β2 (KD = 5–10 μm) (Table I). In contrast, the C-terminal domain, which has been shown to be properly folded by circular dichroism (17Singer A.U. Waldo G.L. Harden T.K. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), did not bind Rac or any other Rho family GTPase. To further verify the specific interaction of activated Rac GTPases with the isolated PH domain of PLC-β2, Rac binding to a set of similar PH domains was compared. Equivalent surface levels of purified PH domains from the β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1, PLC-δ, and PLC-β2 were created. Injections of Gβ1γ2 resulted in a robust binding signal for the PH domain of β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 relative to the PH domains of PLC-δ and PLC-β2 (Fig. 5D). This observation confirms that the β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 PH domain is functional and competent to engage Gβ1γ2 as described previously (41Pitcher J.A. Touhara K. Payne E.S. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11707-11710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The weak signal observed for Gβ1γ2 binding to the PLC-δ and PLC-β2 PH domains did not increase with increasing Gβ1γ2 concentrations and is thus likely to be nonspecific (data not shown). Using this same system, Rac-GTPγS isoforms displayed remarkable specificity for the PH domain of PLC-β2 over the highly homologous PLC-δ and β-adrenergic receptor kin"
https://openalex.org/W1973630457,"Genetic diseases that affect tooth enamel are grouped under the classification amelogenesis imperfecta. Human pedigrees and experiments on transgenic and null mice have all demonstrated that mutations to the secreted proteins amelogenin, enamelin, and enamelysin result in visibly, structurally, or mechanically defective enamel. In an attempt to better define a physiologic function for ameloblastin during enamel formation, we have produced transgenic mice that misexpress the ameloblastin gene. These transgenic animals exhibit imperfections in their enamel that is evident at the nanoscale level. Specifically, ameloblastin overexpression influences enamel crystallite habit and enamel rod morphology. These findings suggest enamel crystallite habit and rod morphology are influenced by the temporal and spatial expression of ameloblastin and may implicate the role of the ameloblastin gene locus in the etiology of a number of undiagnosed autosomally dominant cases of amelogenesis imperfecta."
https://openalex.org/W1964626438,"We showed previously that the intracellular transport of sphingolipids (SLs) is altered in SL storage disease fibroblasts, due in part to the secondary accumulation of free cholesterol. In the present study we examined the mechanism of cholesterol elevation in normal human skin fibroblasts induced by treatment with SLs. When cells were incubated with various natural SLs for 44 h, cholesterol levels increased 25–35%, and cholesterol esterification was reduced. Catabolism of the exogenous SLs was not required for elevation of cholesterol because (i) a non-hydrolyzable and a degradable SL analog elevated cellular cholesterol to similar extents, and (ii) incubation of cells with various SL catabolites, including ceramide, had no effect on cholesterol levels. Elevated cholesterol was derived primarily from low density lipoproteins (LDL) and resulted from up-regulation of LDL receptors induced by cleavage of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1. Upon SL treatment, cholesterol accumulated with exogenous SLs in late endosomes and lysosomes. These results suggest a model in which excess SLs present in endocytic compartments serve as a “molecular trap” for cholesterol, leading to a reduction in cholesterol at the endoplasmic reticulum, induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 cleavage, and up-regulation of LDL receptors.

We showed previously that a fluorescent glycosphingolipid (GSL) analog (BODIPY-lactosylceramide; LacCer) is internalized from the plasma membrane (PM) and transported to the Golgi complex in normal human skin fibroblasts (HSFs) but is mistargeted to endosomes and lysosomes in cells from multiple SLSDs, suggesting a common mechanism of cellular dysfunction in these biochemically distinct diseases (2Chen C.S.

In a subsequent study we showed that these SLSD cells accumulate unesterified cholesterol in the late endosomes and lysosomes (3Puri V. Watanabe R. Dominguez M. Sun X. Wheatley C.L. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 386-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), and this cholesterol plays an important role in the altered sorting and targeting of the GSL analog in SLSD fibroblasts (3Puri V.

Similarly, cholesterol has been reported to accumulate secondary to sphingomyelin storage in sphingomyelinase-deficient (Niemann-Pick A disease) human and mouse cells (7Schuchman E.H. Desnick R.J.

The mechanism by which intracellular cholesterol is elevated and/or redistributes in SLSDs with primary defects in SL catabolism is unknown. In the current study, we show that incubation of normal HSFs with exogenous, naturally occurring SLs resulted in a dramatic increase and redistribution in cellular cholesterol reminiscent of that seen in SLSD cells. These observations led us to study further the relationship between SL accumulation and cellular cholesterol. We provide evidence that accumulation of SLs in endocytic vesicles serves as a molecular trap for cholesterol, binding and immobilizing the sterol as it circulates through the cell. Importantly, although the cell has high levels of free cholesterol that can be readily detected by lipid analysis, the protein machinery that regulates cholesterol homeostasis behaves as if cellular cholesterol levels are low. This leads to an induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP-1) cleavage, transcriptional activation of the LDL receptor (LDLR), and a reduction in cholesterol esterification. Materials—Lipids were obtained from Matreya (State College, PA). Filipin was purchased from Polysciences Inc. (Warrington, Pennsylvania). DiI-LDL was from Intracel (Frederick, MD). Lyso-Lac-S-Cer was synthesized by the Organic Synthesis Core of the Mayo Clinic as described (9Albrecht B. Putz U. Schwarzmann G. Carbohydr. Res. 1995; 276: 289-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Lyso-LacCer and Lyso-Lac-S-Cer were N-acylated with BODIPY fatty acid as described (10Schwarzmann G. Sandhoff K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 319-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and the corresponding products, BODIPY-LacCer and BODIPY-Lac-S-Cer, were purified by TLC and/or high pressure liquid chromatography. Monoclonal antibodies against human EEA1 were from Transduction Laboratories. A monoclonal antibody against lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA) was a kind gift from Dr. Toshihide Kobayashi (RIKEN Frontier Research System, Saitama, Japan). Unless otherwise indicated, all other reagents were from Sigma. Cells and Cell Culture—Normal and SLSD skin fibroblasts were obtained from the Coriell Institute (Camden, NJ) or Human Genetic Mutant Cell repository and cultured in Eagle's MEM (EMEM) plus 10% FBS as described (2Chen C.S.

Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Incubation of Cells with Exogenous SLs—Natural SLs were dissolved in 2:1 ethanol/Me2SO to make a 5 mm stock. An aliquot of this stock solution was added to the culture medium (EMEM plus 10% FBS) to make a final concentration of 40 μm SL. The cells were incubated in this medium for various times at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. Control cultures were incubated with the same amount of ethanol/Me2SO but containing no SL. Cell viability for each treatment was >90%, as assessed by trypan blue staining. Filipin Staining—Cells were fixed in 3% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min followed by incubation in PBS containing 125 μg/ml filipin for 30 min at room temperature (12Neufeld E.B. Wastney M. Patel S.

Analysis of Cholesterol, Cholesterol Esters, and SLs—Monolayer cultures were grown in 60-mm dishes (70–80% confluency) and scraped in 1 ml of PBS. 100 μl of this suspension was used for protein determination (Bradford protein assay), and the remaining 900 μl was used for quantitation of cholesterol, cholesterol esters, or SLs. Cholesterol and cholesterol esters were extracted as described (13Martin O.C. Comly M.E. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Pentchev P.G. Pagano R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2661-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and the lower organic phase containing these lipids was collected and dried under N2. The extracted lipids were then separated by TLC using CHCl3/C2H5OC2H5/CH3COOH, 65:15:1 (v/v/v) as the developing solvent for cholesterol, or heptane/isopropyl ether/acetic acid, 60:40:4 (v/v/v) for cholesterol and cholesterol esters. TLC plates were dried and then stained overnight with iodine. Cholesterol and cholesterol esters were quantified by densitometry and comparison to cholesterol and cholesterol linoleate standards run on the same TLC plate. For SL extraction and analysis (14van Echten G. Iber H. Stotz H. Takatsuki A. Sandhoff K. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 51: 135-139PubMed Google Scholar, 15Schwarzmann G. Hofmann P. Pütz U. Albrecht B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21271-21276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), 900 μl of cell suspension (see above) was mixed with 10 μl of pyridine, followed by the addition of 4.5 ml of CH3OH and 4.5 ml of CHCl3, and stirred overnight at 40 °C. The sample was then centrifuged for 10 min at 500 × g to remove insoluble cellular debris. The supernatant was collected, dried, resuspended in 900 μl of CHCl3/CH3OH (1:1), and saponified by addition of 100 μlof0.5 m KOH (stirred for 2 h at 40 °C). After neutralizing with 10 μl of 5 m acetic acid, the sample was dried, resuspended in synthetic upper phase (CH3OH/H2O/CHCl3, 94:96:6 (v/v/v)), and desalted by passage through a Waters Sep-Pak C18 column (Milford, MA). SLs were separated by TLC along with appropriate standards using CHCl3/CH3OH/15 mm CaCl2 (65:35:8; v/v/v) as the developing solvent. Primulin was used as a detection reagent (16Skipski V.P. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 35: 396-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and lipids were quantified by scanning densitometry. Western Blotting for LDLR or SREBP-1—Cells were grown to 60–70% confluency and treated with lipids for the indicated times. Two hours before completion of the experiment 25 μg/ml N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal was added to inhibit proteolysis of SREBP. Cells were scraped in Western lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, 100 mm NaCl, and 1% SDS, pH 7.6) containing protease inhibitors (Complete™, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), lysed, and homogenized by passing 10 times through a 22-gauge needle. Aliquots of each sample (40 μg of protein) were run on 7 (for LDLR) or 10% SDS-PAGE gels (for SREBP-1) (17Worgall T.S. Johnson R.A. Seo T. Gierens H. Deckelbaum R.J. J. Biol.

Blots were probed with monoclonal LDLR antibody (Oncogene Research Products, San Diego) or monoclonal SREBP-1 antibody (Pharmingen) followed by peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) and detected using Renaissance chemiluminescence reagent plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Colocalization of Exogenous GM1with Cholesterol and Fluorescent Dextran—To study the distribution of exogenously supplied GM1 relative to cellular cholesterol, HSFs were incubated with 40 μm bovine GM1 in culture medium for 44 h at 37 °C as above. The cells were then fixed with 3% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min, permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS (2 min), and then incubated in PBS containing 125 mg/ml filipin and 7.5 mg/ml AlexaFluor 488 CtxB (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min (all incubations were at room temperature). The samples were then washed, mounted, and observed under the fluorescence microscope. To study the localization of GM1, HSFs were first incubated with 40 μm GM1 for 20 h at 37 °C as above. 2 mg/ml Cascade blue dextran (10 kDa, lysine fixable; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was then added to the GM1-containing medium, and the samples were further incubated for 22 h at 37 °C. The samples were then washed with culture medium containing GM1 (but not dextran) and chased for 2 h at 37 °C to label the lysosomes with dextran (18Koval M. Pagano R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 429-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). (All 37 °C incubations were in a CO2 incubator.) The cells were then fixed, permeabilized, and stained with AlexaFluor 488 CtxB as above, except that filipin was not present. The samples were then observed under the fluorescence microscope, and separate images were acquired for CtxB and dextran. Overlap of CtxB with the dextran-positive lysosomes was calculated as described (2Chen C.S. Patterson M.C. Wheatley C.L. O'Brien J.F. Pagano R.E.

Filter sets and exposure times for these double label experiments were selected such that there was no crossover between AlexaFluor 488 CtxB and filipin or blue dextran fluorescence. Colocalization of Cholesterol with EEA1 and LBPA—To study the localization of cholesterol in SL-treated cells, HSFs were incubated with 40 μm bovine globoside in culture medium for 44 h at 37 °C. Cells were then stained with filipin as described above, followed by immunofluorescence using antibodies against EEA1 (labels early endosomes) or LBPA (labels late endosomes) (20Kobayashi T.

Other Methods—For inhibition of glucocerebrosidase, cells were treated with Conduritol B-epoxide (CBE) (21Sillence D.J. Puri V. Marks D.L. Butters T.D. Dwek R.K. Pagano R.E. Platt F.M. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1837-1845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Briefly, an aliquot of a 50 mm stock of CBE was added to cells (∼40–50% confluent) to give a final concentration of 50 μm, and the cultures were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in CO2 incubator prior to the experiment. For studies with fluorescent LDL, cells were grown to 60–70% confluency, incubated with 0.5 μg/ml DiI-LDL (Intracel, Frederick, MD) for 30 min at 4 °C in 10 mm Hepes buffered MEM, pH 7.4 (HMEM). to label the plasma membrane, and washed. The samples were then incubated for 5 min at 37 °C in HMEM to internalize the DiI-LDL, acid-stripped to remove any DiI-LDL remaining on the cell surface (22Sharma D.K. Choudhury A. Singh R.D.

Fluorescence microscopy and image analysis were performed as described previously (4Puri V. Watanabe R. Singh R.D. Dominguez M. Brown J.C. Wheatley C.L. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. J.

Effect of Exogenous SLs on Cholesterol in Normal HSFs— Cells were incubated with 40 μm bovine LacCer or SM for 44 h (see “Experimental Procedures”), and the intracellular distribution of cholesterol was examined by filipin staining. Increased filipin fluorescence was observed following incubation with either lipid, relative to untreated control cells (Fig. 1a). In addition, the pattern of filipin staining was remarkably similar to that seen in various SLSD cell types (3Puri V. Watanabe R. Dominguez M. Sun X. Wheatley C.L. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 386-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Similar results to those shown in Fig. 1a were also obtained when normal HSFs were incubated with C6-SM, a short chain non-fluorescent SM analog, or natural globoside, or natural glucosylceramide (GlcCer) (data not shown). In addition to filipin staining, we also studied the intracellular distribution of NPC1, a protein that contains a sterol sensing domain and normally resides in Rab7 and Rab9 containing late endosomes but which redistributes to lysosomes upon accumulation of cholesterol (12Neufeld E.B.

Following incubation of normal HSFs with natural LacCer or SM, we observed a more intense staining pattern of NPC1 by immunofluorescence, as reported previously (3Puri V. Watanabe R. Dominguez M. Sun X. Wheatley C.L. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 386-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) for SLSD cell types (data not shown). We also found that when normal HSFs were incubated with exogenous SLs as above and then pulse-labeled with fluorescent LacCer, the LacCer analog was targeted to punctate endosomal structures, rather than to the Golgi apparatus as seen in untreated control cells (data not shown). Finally, we quantified the increase in cellular cholesterol by lipid analysis when HSFs were incubated with natural LacCer or SM for various times (Fig. 1b). After 44 h, the increase in cholesterol was nearly the same using either SL; however, at shorter times, cholesterol was seen to increase more rapidly using LacCer than SM. Incubation of HSFs with natural LacCer or SM also resulted in an increase in other classes of SLs (Table I).Table IModulation of cellular SLs and cholesterol in normal HSFsTreatmentGangliosidesSMTrihexosidesDihexosidesMonohexosidesCeramideCholesterolμg lipid/mg proteinControl4.93 ± 3.911.56 ± 7.24.5 ± 2.41.02 ± 1.53.33 ± 2.618.6 ± 6.355.9 ± 5.0LacCer9.6 ± 4.124.82 ± 6.917.35 ± 5.32.98 ± 0.913.67 ± 6.139.4 ± 13.775.5 ± 6.7SM7.47 ± 2.920.46 ± 9.110.01 ± 3.21.01 ± 1.019.62 ± 8.730.3 ± 11.469.9 ± 5.9CBE4.67 ± 2.89.53 ± 3.33.43 ± 2.10.81 ± 0.76.12 ± 2.724.1 ± 4.271.0 ± 4.8 Open table in a new tab The increase in cellular cholesterol upon treatment with exogenous SLs could potentially be due to the formation of SL metabolites. In order to test this, cells were incubated with various concentrations of ceramide (Cer; 5–15 μm), lyso-LacCer (50 μm), gluco-psycosine (50 μm), or psycosine (50 μm) for 44 h. These treatments had no effect on cellular cholesterol levels as determined by filipin staining or lipid extraction and analysis (data not shown). Exogenous SLs Increase LDL Cholesterol Uptake in HSFs— The cholesterol increase in SL-treated cells could be due to an increase in the uptake of LDL cholesterol and/or to an increase in cholesterol synthesis. To test the former possibility, HSFs were incubated with exogenous SM or LacCer for 44 h in a medium containing 5% lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS). Filipin staining of HSFs incubated with SM in the presence of LPDS was virtually identical to that in untreated control cultures grown in 10% FBS indicating no change in cholesterol distribution, whereas incubation with SM in FBS-containing medium showed enhanced staining indicative of cholesterol accumulation (Fig. 2a). It should be noted that the increase in cell-associated SM during a 44-h incubation in the presence of LPDS (∼60% increase) was similar to that seen when incubations were carried out in FBS-containing medium (∼77% increase). Similar results were obtained using bovine LacCer in LPDS medium instead of SM (data not shown). These data show that in cells treated with exogenous SLs, most of the cholesterol that accumulated was derived from lipoproteins present in the FBS-containing culture medium. Accumulation of Endogenous GlcCer Induces Cholesterol Uptake in Normal HSFs—To determine whether accumulation of endogenous SLs in normal HSFs also results in an increase in cellular cholesterol, cells were treated with 50 μm CBE, an inhibitor of lysosomal glucocerebrosidase (25Radin N.S. Vunnan R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 72: 673-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), for 24 h. This resulted in approximately a 2-fold increase in endogenous GlcCer levels (Table I), a dramatic increase in filipin staining (Fig. 2b), and a 27% increase in unesterified cholesterol determined by lipid extraction and analysis (Table I). On the other hand, when the cells were treated with CBE in medium containing 5% LPDS, there was no change in cellular cholesterol relative to untreated control samples (Fig. 2b), although CBE treatment in the presence of LPDS still induced approximately a 2-fold increase in GlcCer (data not shown). Protein Synthesis Is Required for Cholesterol Uptake in SL-treated Cells—To determine whether protein synthesis was required for the elevation in cellular cholesterol induced by exogenous SLs, HSFs were incubated with 40 μm SM for 44 h in the presence or absence of 17.5 μm cycloheximide, and subsequently fixed and stained using filipin as in Fig. 1. No increase in filipin staining was observed in the presence of cycloheximide, whereas in the absence of this drug there was a dramatic increase in staining (Fig. 3a) and approximately a 25% increase in total cellular cholesterol as determined by lipid extraction and analysis. Similar results to those shown in Fig. 3a were obtained using bovine LacCer in place of SM (data not shown). These results demonstrate that protein synthesis is required for the increase in cellular cholesterol that occurs during incubation of HSFs with exogenous SLs. LDLR Expression but Not LDL Internalization Is Increased in SL-treated Cells—We used fluorescent LDL (DiI-LDL) to study the cell surface expression and internalization of the LDLR in HSFs under various conditions. When HSFs were incubated with DiI-LDL at low temperature to bind LDLR at the PM, we observed a 20–50% increase in cells treated with SLs for 24 h relative to untreated cells (Fig. 3b). We also quantified the amount of DiI-LDL internalization during 5 min of endocytosis and found an increase of ∼50% in SL-treated cells relative to control HSFs (Fig. 3b). This increase in LDL uptake in SL-treated cells was most likely due to the increased number of LDLR at the PM because there was little or no difference in the uptake data (relative to controls) after normalization for the number of receptors at the PM (data not shown). To further investigate the increase in LDLR induced by SL treatment, we also studied LDLR expression by Western blot analysis. We found a 2–5-fold increase in LDLR expression in cells treated with SLs for 5 h relative to control cells depending on the SL used (Fig. 4). This variation in receptor expression may reflect differences in the elevation of cell-associated SLs which varied from a 1.6 to a 2.1-fold increase in the treated cells, depending on the SL type (data not shown). A 30–80% increase in LDLR expression was also seen when longer incubations (e.g. 24–48 h) with the exogenous SLs were used (data not shown). CBE treatment (50 μm; 24 h) also resulted in an increase (∼2-fold) of LDLR expression (data not shown). These results suggested that SL accumulation induced the up-regulation of LDLR in normal HSFs, resulting in an increased uptake of LDL and high levels of intracellular cholesterol. SL Treatment Results in Sterol Regulatory Element-mediated Gene Transcription of LDLR—To investigate the mechanism of up-regulation of the LDLR by exogenous SLs, we next studied SREBP-1 expression in normal, cholesterol-depleted, and SL-treated cells. As shown in Fig. 5a, SREBP was cleaved to the mature 68-kDa fragment (mSREBP) when HSFs were incubated for 5 h with exogenous LacCer, globoside, GM1, or SM, similar to that seen when cells were incubated in LPDS medium, whereas little SREBP-1 cleavage was seen in control samples that were not incubated with exogenous SLs. Similar results were also obtained using HSFs following a 24-h treatment with 50 μm CBE to increase endogenous GlcCer (data not shown). These results show that SLs could potentially play an important role in regulating the transcriptional processing of SREBP-1. We also attempted to study the cleavage of SREBP-2; however, using commercial antibodies, we were unable to consistently detect this isoform in our samples. Table I shows that Cer levels were elevated in SL-treated HSFs. To test the possibility that Cer might activate SREBP-1 cleavage, HSFs were incubated with bovine Cer, C2-Cer, C8-Cer, or sphingomyelinase under various conditions; however, no activation of SREBP was found (data not shown). To test further the possibility that degradation of the exogenous SLs was required for induction of SREBP-1 cleavage, we used a non-degradable analog of LacCer, C8-Lac-S-Cer (9Albrecht B. Putz U. Schwarzmann G. Carbohydr. Res. 1995; 276: 289-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 15Schwarzmann G. Hofmann P. Pütz U. Albrecht B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21271-21276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In preliminary studies we found that incubation of HSFs with C8-Lac-S-Cer elevated cellular cholesterol to a similar extent as that seen using bovine LacCer (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 5b, both Lac-S-Cer and bovine LacCer resulted in cleavage of SREBP-1 to produce the transcriptionally active 68-kDa fragment, demonstrating that the intact SL can modulate the transcriptional regulation of LDLR. Interestingly, although no degradation of Lac-S-Cer could be detected, cellular Cer was elevated ∼1.8-fold in this experiment (data not shown). SRE-mediated Gene Transcription and High Levels of LDLR in SLSD Cells—We showed previously (3Puri V. Watanabe R. Dominguez M. Sun X. Wheatley C.L. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 386-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) that SLSD fibroblasts have elevated levels of cellular cholesterol. Because these cell types also accumulate endogenous SLs (e.g. see Table II), we examined SREBP-1 activation and LDLR expression to determine whether they were similar to normal HSFs incubated with exogenous SLs. As shown in Fig. 6, there is an enhanced cleavage of SREBP-1 and approximately a 1.5–2-fold increase in the levels of LDLR in Niemann Pick type A, Niemann Pick type C, and GM1 gangliosidosis cell types relative to normal HSFs grown in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum. Other SLSD cell types have not yet been studied.Table IISL composition in NP-C, NP-A, and GM1 gangliosidosis cell typesCell typeGangliosidesSMTrihexosidesDihexosidesMonohexosidesCeramideμg lipid/mg proteinNPC8.8 ± 3.731.6 ± 12.428.0 ± 13.16.9 ± 5.16.4 ± 5.113.4 ± 9.5NPA9.5 ± 2.830.1 ± 3.27.1 ± 4.14.4 ± 2.84.7 ± 0.78.1 ± 8.0GM1 gangliosidosis10.3 ± 5.325.3 ± 1.710.6 ± 1.0ND9.0 ± 4.6ND Open table in a new tab Decreased Cholesterol Esterification in SL-treated Cells— The activation of SREBP-1 in SL-treated cells suggests that even though total cholesterol levels are high, cholesterol is unable to reach the ER pool that regulates SREBP-1 transport to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage.

https://openalex.org/W1992530782,"PLU-1 is a large (1544 amino acids) nuclear protein that is highly expressed in breast cancers and is proposed to function as a regulator of gene expression. A yeast two-hybrid screen using PLU-1 as bait has identified two unrelated PLU-1 interacting proteins, namely brain factor-1 (BF-1) and paired box 9 (PAX9), both of which are developmental transcription factors. BF-1 and PAX9 interact with PLU-1 via a novel conserved sequence motif (Ala-<i>X</i>-Ala-Ala-<i>X</i>-Val-Pro-<i>X</i><sub>4</sub>-Val-Pro-<i>X</i><sub>8</sub>-Pro, termed the VP motif), because deletion or site-directed mutagenesis of this motif in either protein abolishes PLU-1 interaction <i>in vivo</i>. In a reporter assay system, PLU-1 has potent transcriptional repression activity. BF-1 and PAX9 also represses transcription in the same assay, but co-expression of PLU-1 with BF-1 or PAX9 significantly enhances this repression. Mutation of the PLU-1 binding motifs in BF-1 and PAX9 abolishes the observed PLU-1 co-repression activity. These data support a role for PLU-1 acting as a transcriptional co-repressor of two unrelated developmental transcription factors. Because both BF-1 and PAX proteins interact with members of the groucho co-repressor family, it is plausible that PLU-1 has a role in groucho-mediated transcriptional repression."
https://openalex.org/W1972973591,"The helicase of hepatitis C virus (HCV) unwinds nucleic acid using the energy of ATP hydrolysis. The ATPase cycle is believed to induce protein conformational changes to drive helicase translocation along the length of the nucleic acid. We have investigated the energetics of nucleic acid binding by HCV helicase to understand how the nucleotide ligation state of the helicase dictates the conformation of its nucleic acid binding site. Because most of the nucleotide ligation states of the helicase are transient due to rapid ATP hydrolysis, several compounds were analyzed to find an efficient unhydrolyzable ATP analog. We found that the β-γ methylene/amine analogs of ATP, ATPγS, or [AlF4]ADP were not effective in inhibiting the ATPase activity of HCV helicase. On the other hand, [BeF3]ADP was found to be a potent inhibitor of the ATPase activity, and it binds tightly to HCV helicase with a 1:1 stoichiometry. Equilibrium binding studies showed that HCV helicase binds single-stranded nucleic acid with a high affinity in the absence of ATP or in the presence of ADP. Upon binding to the ATP analog, a 100-fold reduction in affinity for ssDNA was observed. The reduction in affinity was also observed in duplex DNA with 3′ single-stranded tail and in RNA but not in duplex DNA. The results of this study indicate that the nucleic acid binding site of HCV helicase is allosterically modulated by the ATPase reaction. The binding energy of ATP is used to bring HCV helicase out of a tightly bound state to facilitate translocation, whereas ATP hydrolysis and product release steps promote tight rebinding of the helicase to the nucleic acid. On the basis of these results we propose a Brownian motor model for unidirectional translocation of HCV helicase along the nucleic acid length.

Here we have studied the properties of the helicase domain of NS3 protein (NS3h) expressed as a separate polypeptide. NS3h is a 3′ to 5′ helicase that can unwind both RNA and DNA (1Gwack Y. Kim D.W. Han J.H. Choe J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 47-54Google Scholar, 2Gwack Y. Yoo H. Song I. Choe J. Han J.H. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2909-2915Google Scholar). Nucleic acid unwinding is a stepwise process involving translocation and local separation of the duplex nucleic acid strands (3Levin M.K. Patel S.S. Schliwa M. Molecular motors. Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH, Weinheim, Germany2002: 179-198Google Scholar). In the wedge mechanism, a simple mechanism of unwinding, strand separation is accomplished by unidirectional translocation of the helicase and capture of the ssDNA (3Levin M.K. Patel S.S. Schliwa M. Molecular motors. Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH, Weinheim, Germany2002: 179-198Google Scholar, 4Patel S.S. Picha K.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 651-697Google Scholar). In such a mechanism, the basic activity of the helicase is unidirectional translocation driven by the ATPase cycles. The mechanism by which ATPase drives directional translocation of the helicase is however not known. Each cycle of the ATPase reaction consists of a number of steps including ATP binding, hydrolysis, phosphate release, ADP release, and rebinding of ATP. The ATPase cycle allows the helicase to adopt various nucleotide ligation states that allosterically control the conformation of the nucleic acid binding site. Thus, it is believed that the ATPase cycle causes conformational changes in the nucleic acid binding site to drive the movement of the helicase along the length of the nucleic acid. Several structural features including the oligomeric state of the helicase and the number of ATP and nucleic acid binding sites influence the helicase mechanism. HCV helicase does not form stable oligomers, and each helicase molecule has one nucleic acid binding site (5Preugschat F. Averett D.R. Clarke B.E. Porter D.J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24449-24457Google Scholar, 6Levin M.K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31839-31846Google Scholar, 7Levin M.K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29377-29385Google Scholar). Although sequence and crystallographic data support a single NTP binding site (8Yao N.H. Hesson T. Cable M. Hong Z. Kwong A.D. Le H.V. Weber P.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 463-467Google Scholar, 9Kim J.L. Morgenstern K.A. Griffith J.P. Dwyer M.D. Thomson J.A. Murcko M.A. Lin C. Caron P.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 89-100Google Scholar), it was proposed that the HCV helicase molecule has two ATP binding sites (10Porter D.J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7390-7396Google Scholar). In this paper we explore the ATP binding stoichiometry with direct nucleotide binding assays. To understand the mechanism of helicase translocation, it is important to identify as well as to characterize biochemically and structurally the conformational states of the nucleic acid binding site. To this end, it is necessary to determine the nucleic acid affinity of the helicase in its various nucleotide ligation states. In a recent article, we studied the nucleic acid binding properties of HCV helicase in the nucleotide-free state and found that NS3h binds DNA and RNA with a high affinity in the absence of nucleotide (7Levin M.K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29377-29385Google Scholar). The minimal DNA binding site of NS3h is 8 bases, and it binds DNA with a microscopic Kd of 4nm (7Levin M.K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29377-29385Google Scholar). The studies of nucleic acid interactions in the presence of ATP or in the E·ATP state are more difficult because the ATPase rate of HCV helicase is high and therefore E·ATP intermediate is short-lived. One way to overcome this problem is to use an unhydrolyzable ATP analog. In this article we report the interactions between NS3h protein and unhydrolyzable ATP analogs and their effect on nucleic acid affinity. The results provide insights into the mechanism by which ATP binding and hydrolysis modulate the binding of NS3h to nucleic acid. The helicase domain of HCV (strain HCV-1) containing a C-terminal His-tag (11Kim D.W. Gwack Y. Han J.H. Choe J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 160-166Google Scholar) was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified by nickel-chelating and anion exchange chromatography and quantitated as described previously (6Levin M.K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31839-31846Google Scholar). MOPS-free acid was purchased from Sigma, and [α-32P]ATP was from Amersham Biosciences. Ultra-pure Tween 20 was purchased from Sigma and purified as described previously (7Levin M.K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29377-29385Google Scholar). Poly(U) (210 bases, average length, Amersham Biosciences) concentration is expressed as moles of polymers. The oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) and purified by PAGE in 7 m urea, 60 °C. U15 was synthesized and purified by Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, CO) and was deprotected according to the supplied protocol. The concentration of nucleic acids was determined spectrophotometrically using extinction coefficients calculated from nucleotide compositions. The fluorescent nucleotide analog mantADP was a kind gift from Dr. Dong-Eun Kim. All experiments were performed at 22 °C in 50 mm MOPS·NaOH, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.0, unless mentioned otherwise. ATPase Assay—The ATPase activity was measured at room temperature (about 22 °C). NS3h protein was preincubated with 0.1 μm poly(U); the reaction was initiated by the addition of [α-32P]ATP and stopped with 0.5 m formic acid (final concentration). The reaction products were separated by TLC on PEI Cellulose F sheets (from EM Science) in 0.4 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 3.4, and quantitated with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). The ATPase time course was analyzed to determine initial rates. Fluorimetric Assays—Fluorescence was measured using Fluoro-Max-2 spectrofluorimeter (Jobin Yvon, Spex Instruments S.A., Inc.) in a 10 × 10 × 40-mm quartz cuvette with a magnetic stir bar in 2.8 ml of the reaction buffer. The intrinsic NS3h protein fluorescence at 340 nm was measured by exciting the sample at 280 nm. MantADP binding was measured by exciting NS3h at 280 nm and measuring the fluorescence of mantADP at 443 nm due to FRET. The fluorescence of etheno-DNA at 405 nm was measured by exciting the sample at 330 nm. The observed fluorescence intensity values, FO, were corrected for sample dilution and inner filter effect according to Equation 1, F=FoV0+ViV0×10(AEX+AEM2)(Eq. 1) where F is corrected fluorescence intensity, V0 is initial sample volume, Vi is total volume of titrant added, and AEX and AEM are absorbance values at the excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. In titrations with constant amount of fluorescent compound, the fluorescence intensity values were fit to Equation 2, F = FS+ fCC(Eq. 2) where FS is the starting fluorescence of the reaction mixture, fC is fluorescence coefficient of complex formation, and C is concentration of the complex. In titrations with increasing amount of fluorescent compound, the fluorescence intensity values were fit to Equation 3, F=FS+fDD+fCC(Eq. 3) where fD is fluorescence coefficient of free dye and D is total concentration of the dye. Complex formation by simple one-to-one binding is described by Equation 4, C=Kd+E+D−(Kd+E+D)2−4ED2(Eq. 4) where E is total protein concentration. [BeF3]ADP Is an Efficient Unhydrolyzable ATP Analog of NS3h Helicase—The NS3h·ATP complex has a lifetime of less than 25 ms because of rapid ATP hydrolysis, which makes it difficult to investigate the DNA binding properties of NS3h in its ATP-bound state. An unhydrolyzable ATP analog can solve this problem. Ideally the ATP analog should bind the ATP binding site of NS3h as tightly as ATP, and by imitating the shape and surface properties of ATP, it should cause the same conformational changes in the NS3h structure. Thus far, there has been no detailed study of an efficient unhydrolyzable ATP analog of HCV helicase. Therefore, we screened several compounds that have been used as unhydrolyzable ATP analogs in other NTPases. Potential candidates of an ATP analog were screened by testing their ability to inhibit the ATPase activity of NS3h. The steady-state ATPase rate of 10 nm NS3h was measured in the presence of 0.2 μm poly(U) and 1.5 mm ATP in the absence and in the presence of an 0.5 mm potential inhibitor. As shown in Fig. 1, the addition of ADP, ADPCP, ADPNP, ATPγS, or [AlF4]ADP did not have a significant effect on the ATPase rate of NS3h. However, the addition of [BeF3]ADP reduced the ATPase rate of NS3h more than 10-fold. A 2-fold decrease in rate was observed also with BeCl2. The effect of ATP analogs was also determined at higher protein (90 nm) and inhibitor (1 mm) concentrations; the results showed that [BeF3]ADP reduced the ATPase rate to the highest extent. To determine the mechanism of inhibition by [BeF3]ADP, the ATPase Km and kcat values were measured in the absence and presence of [BeF3]ADP. These experiments showed that 20 μm [BeF3]ADP increased the NS3h ATPase Km more than 4-fold but did not change the kcat (data not shown), indicating that [BeF3]ADP inhibits NS3h ATPase by a competitive mechanism. The competitive inhibition constant, KI, for [AlF4]ADP and [BeF3]ADP was determined by measuring the ATPase rate as a function of aluminum or beryllium fluoride concentrations (Fig. 2). The data were fit to a competitive inhibition equation (Equation 5) with BeF3−⋅K1=8.5±3μM and AIF4−⋅K1=130±40 μM. Thus, [BeF3]ADP is close to 16 times better as an inhibitor than [AlF4]ADP. υ=[ATP]kcat[ATP]+Km(1+IKI)(Eq. 5) Affinity of NS3h Helicase for [BeF3]ADP —[BeF3]ADP is an effective inhibitor of the ATPase activity of NS3h, and the literature indicates that binding of [BeF3]ADP mimics the ground-state rather than the transition-state structure of the ATP-bound state of the protein (12Ponomarev M.A. Timofeev V.P. Levitsky D.I. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 261-263Google Scholar, 13Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Google Scholar). Beryllium forms a number of complexes with fluorine that depend on the pH of the solution and the concentration of the fluoride ion. The mechanism of binding and inhibition of the ATPase activity by ADP·beryllofluoride is not completely understood. It is believed that the major species in solution is BeF3− when the concentration of fluoride is about 5 mm (14Chabre M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 6-10Google Scholar) and that BeF3− and ADP assemble at the active site of the ATPase to form [BeF3]ADP (15Martin R.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 155: 1194-1200Google Scholar). We measured the binding of [BeF3]ADP to estimate the affinity of ATP for NS3h. [BeF3]ADP binding to NS3h protein is not associated with an observable change in intrinsic protein fluorescence. Therefore, to estimate the affinity of [BeF3]ADP for NS3h, we used a fluorescent analog of ADP, mantADP (Fig. 3A). The fluorescent properties of mantADP (360 nm excitation and 440 nm emission) are suitable for FRET from the intrinsic protein fluorophors, as shown by the excitation and emission spectra of protein and mantADP in Fig. 3B. Interestingly, FRET from protein to mantADP was observed only in the presence of BeF3−, indicating that under the experimental conditions mantADP binding is not observable, but [BeF3]mantADP binding is significant. Our experiments also showed that mantATP is a substrate of NS3h and is hydrolyzed with a 3–4-fold lower kcat than ATP (data not shown). Fluorimetric titrations were carried out to measure the equilibrium binding of the ATP analog. The protein was excited at 280 nm, and emission of mantADP due to FRET was measured at 443 nm. Under these conditions the background fluorescence from free mantADP was minimal. Three components participate in the formation of the NS3h·[BeF3]ADP complex; hence, the titration can be carried out in several different ways. Titration with BeCl2 is shown in Fig. 4A. In this experiment a constant amount of NS3h, mantADP, and NaF was titrated with increasing concentrations of BeCl2. The resulting binding data showed that the apparent Kd of BeCl2 is about 26 μm. In a second type of titration, constant amounts of NS3h, NaF, and 0.5 mm BeCl2 was titrated with increasing concentrations of mantADP. Such titration provided an apparent Kd of mantADP close to 80 nm and the stoichiometry of [BeF3]mantADP binding close to one (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that the affinity of NS3h for ATP is high and that there is only one ATP binding site on the NS3h molecule. We further characterized the NS3h·[BeF3]ADP complex by measuring its rate of formation and dissociation. The rate of [BeF3]ADP binding was measured by monitoring the increase in FRET (Fig. 5). The apparent rate of complex formation at 1 μm NS3h, 2 μm mantADP, 100 μm BeCl2, and 5 mm NaF is about 0.02 s–1. The dissociation rate of mantADP from the NS3h·[BeF3]mantADP complex was measured by chasing with a high concentration of ADP. The dissociation rate was found to be slow (0.005 s–1) as shown in Fig. 5. Thus [BeF3]ADP is a tightly binding and slowly dissociating inhibitor. [BeF3]ADP Binding Decreases the Affinity of NS3h for ssDNA—Our previous studies have shown that NS3h binds ssDNA in the absence of ATP with a microscopic Kd of 4nm and with a minimal ssDNA binding site of 8 nucleotides. We have used [BeF3]ADP, a tightly binding ATP analog, to determine the effect of ATP binding on NS3h affinity for ssDNA, dsDNA, ss/dsDNA, and RNA (Table I). The Kd values were determined by fluorimetric titrations both in the absence and the presence of 0.1 mm ADP plus 0.5 mm BeF3−. As shown in Fig. 6, NS3h binds a (dT)12 DNA with a Kd of 0.4 nm in the absence of nucleotide. In the presence of [BeF3]ADP, NS3h binds (dT)12 with a 100-fold weaker affinity. The same effect was observed with a ss/dsDNA. In the absence of ATP, NS3h binds the ss/dsDNA substrate (HP7, Table I) with a 0.6 nmKd. In the presence of [BeF3]ADP, the affinity of NS3h for ss/dsDNA substrate was reduced about 70-fold. At the same time, NS3h affinity to a dsDNA substrate is weak and remains almost unchanged by the presence of [BeF3]ADP. A control experiment in the absence of BeCl2, but in the presence of ADP and NaF, showed tight affinity to ssDNA (data not shown). These results indicate that the binding to ssDNA becomes weaker only when BeCl2 is present in addition to ADP and NaF. Similar results were observed with RNA. The affinity of (U)15 decreased 24-fold in the presence of the ATP analog. These results indicate that NS3h binds ss nucleic acid or ss/dsDNA very tightly in the absence of nucleotide or in the presence of ADP, but the affinity decreases manyfold when NS3h binds ATP, showing that ATP binding and hydrolysis trigger partial DNA release and tight rebinding, respectively.Table IKd of nucleic acid substrates in the absence and presence of ADP[BeF3] Open table in a new tab Fig. 6[BeF3]ADP reduces the NS3h affinity for nucleic acid. NS3h Kd values for nucleic acid substrates were determined by fluorimetric titration both in the absence (white bars) and presence of 0.1 mm ADP and 0.5 mm [BeF3]– (striped bars). The following nucleic acid substrates were used: (dT)12 (ssDNA), HP7 (ss/dsDNA), RI0 (dsDNA), and (U)15 (ssRNA).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A different type of fluorimetric titration was conducted to confirm that [BeF3]ADP binding to NS3h indeed reduces its affinity for ssDNA. The equilibrium binding of ssDNA was carried out using an etheno-labeled fluorescent DNA substrate (Fig. 7). Previously, we reported the titration of 100 nm NS3h helicase with increasing amount of etheno-labeled 20-mer (7Levin M.K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29377-29385Google Scholar). The same DNA was used to titrate NS3h in the presence of 0.1 mm ADP and 0.5 mm BeF3−. As shown in Fig. 7, [BeF3]ADP reduces the affinity of NS3h helicase for ssDNA. The Kd of ssDNA in the absence of ATP analog is less then 1 nm, and it increases to 57 ± 26 nm in the presence of [BeF3]ADP, a value similar to the 39 ± 1.3 nm obtained by intrinsic protein fluorescence titration for (dT)12. Etheno-labeled DNA titration data therefore confirms that [BeF3]ADP binding to NS3h reduces its affinity for ssDNA. Helicases unwind long stretches of duplex nucleic acid by a stepwise process involving unidirectional translocation and local separation of the nucleic acid strands. Both of these activities are fueled by NTP hydrolysis, but their mechanisms are not known. One of the simplest mechanisms of strand separation, the “wedge mechanism,” involves the helicase moving unidirectionally along one of the strands while pushing the other strand away (3Levin M.K. Patel S.S. Schliwa M. Molecular motors. Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH, Weinheim, Germany2002: 179-198Google Scholar, 16Delagoutte E. von Hippel P.H. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2002; 35: 431-478Google Scholar). Thus, translocation is likely to be the basic activity of helicases, and understanding it is necessary for deciphering the mechanism of nucleic acid unwinding. It is believed that NTP binding, hydrolysis, and product release steps induce conformational changes in the helicase nucleic acid binding site. These conformational changes drive stepwise unidirectional translocation of the helicase along the nucleic acid length. To understand how the NTPase reaction is coupled to translocation and unwinding, it is necessary to determine how the NTPase reaction modulates the affinity of the helicase for nucleic acid. Our previous studies have characterized in detail the interaction of NS3h with ssDNA in the absence of ATP (7Levin M.K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29377-29385Google Scholar). Here we determine how the ssDNA affinity changes when NS3h is in the ATP-bound state. The ATP-bound state of NS3h is transient, because NS3h hydrolyzes ATP at a fast rate. Therefore, to measure the energetics of the NS3h·ATP·DNA complex, we tested several unhydrolyzable ATP analogs to find one that would bind tightly and mimic the ATP state of NS3h. Our studies revealed that [BeF3]ADP is an efficient inhibitor of NS3h ATPase. Inhibition of HCV helicase by beryllofluoride has not been reported previously. It has been reported that NaF, which is used to make beryllofluoride, inhibits the ATPase activity of HCV helicase. The inhibitory effect of NaF was not observed, however, in our studies, perhaps because relatively low concentrations of NaF (5 mm) were used. Interestingly, [BeF3]ADP inhibits the ATPase activity of NS3h, but the commonly used unhydrolyzable ATP analogs including ADPNP, ADPCP, ATPγS, and [AlF4]ADP were not as effective in inhibiting the ATPase activity of NS3h. Thus, different helicases seem to have different preferences for binding unhydrolyzable ATP analogs, which cannot be predicted simply from their protein structures. Beryllofluoride along with ADP has been used as an ATP analog in studies of ATPases and kinases, and recently beryllofluoride has been shown to be an effective acyl phosphate analog (14Chabre M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 6-10Google Scholar, 17Cho H. Wang W. Kim R. Yokota H. Damo S. Kim S.H. Wemmer D. Kustu S. Yan D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8525-8530Google Scholar, 18Yan D. Cho H.S. Hastings C.A. Igo M.M. Lee S.Y. Pelton J.G. Stewart V. Wemmer D.E. Kustu S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14789-14794Google Scholar). The tetrahedral geometry of the beryllofluoride complex suggests that [BeF3]ADP mimics the ground-state structure, such as E·ATP or E·Pi·ADP, rather than the transition-state structure of the intermediate in the ATPase reaction (14Chabre M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 6-10Google Scholar). Studies of myosin indicate that [BeF3]ADP mimics the ATP-bound state of the protein, whereas studies of kinesin indicate that it mimics the ADP·Pi-bound state (12Ponomarev M.A. Timofeev V.P. Levitsky D.I. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 261-263Google Scholar, 13Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Google Scholar, 19Shibuya H. Kondo K. Kimura N. Maruta S. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 573-579Google Scholar). Our studies indicate that [BeF3]ADP is unlikely to mimic the E·Pi·ADP state because this complex appears to be unstable, as evidenced by [18O]Pi exchange and ADP inhibition studies. 18O isotope exchange between inorganic phosphate and water was not observed with the HCV helicase (data not shown), which indicates that either ATP synthesis is negligible or Pi binding is weak. As shown in this article, ADP is not an efficient inhibitor of the ATPase activity, indicating that its binding is weak. On the basis of these results, we suggest that [BeF3]ADP is an ATP analog of HCV helicase. [BeF3]ADP was used as an unhydrolyzable ATP analog to determine the ssDNA affinity of NS3h in the ATP-bound state. Using the fluorescent mantADP compound and FRET, we determined that the apparent Kd of NS3h·[BeF3]mantADP complex is close to 80 nm. Assuming that NS3h is saturated with BeF3−, this approximates the Kd of NS3h·ATP complex. Note that KI value of [BeF3]ADP is much higher than the Kd. This may be because the KI value was obtained by fitting the data to a competitive inhibition model, which assumes that inhibitor and substrate binding are rapid equilibrium steps, and this may not be the case. Therefore, the direct binding assay provides a more accurate estimation of the binding affinity of [BeF3]ADP. The tight affinity of NS3h for [BeF3]ADP facilitated the measurement of the stoichiometry of NS3h·ATP analog complex, which indicated that NS3h monomer has only one ATP binding site. This is in contrast with a report that proposes that the HCV helicase monomer has two ATP binding sites (10Porter D.J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7390-7396Google Scholar). The stoichiometry of 1:1 in our studies was obtained by direct equilibrium binding measurements, whereas the reported studies used the inhibition of ATPase activity as a function of ADP concentration in the presence of NaF to obtain the 1:2 stoichiometry. Thus it appears that the ATPase reaction at the single nucleotide binding site of NS3h controls the conformation of the nucleic acid binding site. We measured the effect of nucleotides on NS3h binding to DNA. The experiments showed that the presence of ATP analog leads to a 100-fold reduction of NS3h affinity for ss or ss/ds nucleic acid, whereas ADP has no effect. The ATPase cycle of any helicase involves a number of intermediates, some of which potentially have an allosteric effect on the nucleic acid binding site (Scheme I). The key question is how the reactions at the ATP binding site that have allosteric effects on the nucleic acid binding site lead to translocation of the helicase along the length of the nucleic acid. In the case of NS3h, the nucleotides ADP, ADP·Pi, and their analogs do not show high energy interactions with NS3h. Thus, the allosteric effects in NS3h are expected mainly from two steps, ATP binding and product release. Translocation driven by two conformational changes can be accomplished if the helicase utilizes both directional (power stroke) and stochastic (Brownian) motions. We propose a Brownian motor model, which shows how the ATPase cycle of NS3h is coupled to the directional motion of the helicase. The Brownian motor mechanism in Fig. 8 describes the translocation of NS3h helicase as it cycles through two states: E and E·ATP. Our previous studies showed that NS3h does not form stable oligomers (7Levin M.K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29377-29385Google Scholar), and recently we observed dsDNA unwinding by NS3h monomer. 2M. K. Levin and S. S. Patel, unpublished results. Thus the proposed model does not involve NS3h oligomerization. Fig. 8, A and B, shows, respectively, the mechanics and energetics of the Brownian motor mechanism. The binding of NS3h to ssDNA is a high energy event. Some special properties of ssDNA-NS3h interface can utilize this energy for unidirectional translocation by creating a local binding free energy gradient along the ssDNA length. This is represented by the sawtooth binding energy profile in Fig. 8B (solid line). In the absence of ATP, NS3h is trapped on the nucleic acid in its lowest energy state, unable to translocate (Fig. 8, A and B, positions 3 and 5). The binding of ATP switches NS3h to a different conformation with a weaker affinity for nucleic acid (Fig. 8, A and B, positions 2 and 4). In this weak binding state, the binding free energy is constant along the nucleic acid length (Fig. 8B, dotted line), which allows the helicase to slide along the length of the nucleic acid in either direction because of Brownian motion (Fig. 8, A and B, position 4). In the weakly bound state, there is a possibility that NS3h completely dissociates from the nucleic acid and that it is a nonproductive event. The random movement of the helicase along the length of the nucleic acid lasts only a short time because of rapid ATP hydrolysis. After ATP is hydrolyzed and products are released, the helicase rebinds DNA tightly. If Brownian motion moved the helicase backward, then upon rebinding to the nucleic acid the helicase will end up in the same position in which it started, without net movement (Fig. 8B, position 3). The helicase that diffuses in the forward direction (Fig. 8B, position 5) will end up one step forward from its original position upon tight binding to the nucleic acid. Thus repeated binding and release of the helicase catalyzed by the NTPase cycles results in a net unidirectional translocation of the helicase along the length of the nucleic acid. According to the mechanism proposed here for NS3h, the energy of ATP binding is used to recover the enzyme from the energetic well of a tightly bound state, whereas ATP hydrolysis allows the protein to assume the tightly binding state and to trigger helicase rebinding linked to forward motion. The proposed mechanism may be generally applicable to other helicases, although they may have phases of their ATPase cycle and DNA binding affinity coordinated in a different manner. For example, ATP binding may switch the helicase into a tight ssDNA binding state rather than the weak binding state observed for the HCV helicase. The proposed model is applicable to helicases that function as monomers or oligomers. With oligomeric helicases, an increased processivity in movement would be observed if the ATPase reaction is coordinated among the subunits.

https://openalex.org/W2055158765,"Cobra cardiotoxins (CTXs) have previously been shown to induce membrane fusion of vesicles formed by phospholipids such as cardiolipin or sphingomyelin. CTX can also form a pore in membrane bilayers containing a anionic lipid such as phosphatidylserine or phosphatidylglycerol. Herein, we show that the interaction of CTX with negatively charged lipids causes CTX dimerization, an important intermediate for the eventual oligomerization of CTX during the CTX-induced fusion and pore formation process. The structural basis of the lipid-induced oligomerization of CTX A3, a major CTX from Naja atra, is then illustrated by the crystal structure of CTX A3 in complex with SDS; SDS likely mimics anionic lipids of the membrane under micelle conditions at 1.9-Å resolution. The crystal packing reveals distinct SDS-free and SDS-rich regions; in the latter two types of interconnecting CTX A3 dimers, D1 and D2, and several SDS molecules can be identified to stabilize D1 and D2 by simultaneously interacting with residues at each dimer interface. When the three CTXSDS complexes in the asymmetric unit are overlaid, the orientation of CTX A3 monomers relative to the SDS molecules in the crystal is strikingly similar to that of the toxin with respect to model membranes as determined by NMR and Fourier transform infrared methods. These results not only illustrate how lipid-induced CTX dimer formation may be transformed into oligomers either as inverted micelles of fusion intermediates or as membrane pore of anionic lipid bilayers but also underscore a potential role for SDS in x-ray diffraction study of protein-membrane interactions in the future.

Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Parker M.W. Protein Toxin Structure. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1996: 271-290Crossref Google Scholar). CTX has also been named cytotoxin because it brings about membrane leakage against many cells including red blood cells and phospholipid membrane vesicles (2Dufton M.J. Hider R.C. Pharmacol. Ther. 1987; 36: 1-40Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This effect is due in part to the interaction of CTX with phospholipid bilayer. For instance, CTX-induced fusions of zwitterionic sphingomyelin vesicles and negatively charged cardiolipin model membranes have been reported, respectively, for CTXs from Taiwan cobra (Naja atra) and African cobra (Naja mossambica) venom (3Aripov T.F.

After a deep penetration of CTX II of N. mossambica into the acyl chain region of anionic lipid bilayers, an enhanced lipid mixing, as detected by fluorescence fusion essay and the appearance of fusion intermediate of well defined particles, presumably inverted micelles, as observed by freeze-fracture electron microscopy, have been shown to occur during the CTX-induced fusion process of cardiolipin vesicles (5Batenburg A.M. Bougis P.E. Rochat H. Verkleij A.J. de Kruijff B. Biochemstry. 1985; 24: 7101-7110Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Apparently the reorganization of CTX-lipid complex plays an important role in the aforementioned CTX-induced membrane-related activity. The lytic property of CTXs is attributed to the coexistence of an exposed hydrophobic patch and a cluster of basic residues forming a cationic zone (6Rees B. Bilwes A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 285-405Google Scholar). Based on the phosphatidylcholine (PC) membrane binding activities of CTXs, two distinct types of CTX, P-(Pro-30-containing) and S-(Ser-28-containing), have been identified (7Chien K.Y. Chiang C.M.

Biophys J. 2002; 83: 144-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), of which the P-type CTX interacts more strongly than the S-type with membranes. The presence of the proline in P-type CTX imposes a ω-like conformation on L2 that tightly binds to a water molecule, which plays an important role in the CTX membrane binding activity (9Bilwes A. Rees B. Moras D. Menez R. Menez A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 122-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 10Sun Y.J. Wu W.G. Chiang C.M. Hsin A.Y. Hsiao C.D.

The presence of low sequence homology in L1 regions among CTXs (Fig. 1A) also hints at toxic specificity of these polypeptides. For instance, local conformational changes in L1 (Val-7–Pro-8 peptide bond) of cytotoxin II from Naja oxiana strongly reduce the binding of its minor (with cis-Pro-8) form as compared with the major (with trans-Pro-8) one to membranes (8Efremov R.G.

Like other CTXs, CTX A3 is a basic protein (pI = 9.38) that is capable of depolarizing cardiomyocytes and possesses lytic activity on many other cells. CTX A5, a minor component of the venom of the Taiwan cobra, is a 62-residue P-type CTX with strong lipid binding capability. Although it lacks cardiotoxicity, CTX A5 is also called cardiotoxin because its amino acid sequence is homologous to that of CTX A3 (4Chien K.-Y. Huang W.N. Jean J.-H. Wu W. J. Biol.

To address these issues and to gain an insight into the mechanism of CTX-induced membrane leakage and fusion processes, we co-crystallized CTX A3 with SDS and determined its three-dimensional structure under micelle conditions. The results also provide the first high resolution molecular model of CTX-lipid complex to understand how lipid-induced CTX dimerization may contribute to the CTX oligomerization required for the formation of fusion intermediate and membrane pores in the previously reported CTX-induced membrane related activities. Materials and Purification—Rhodamine B isothiocyanate, fluorescently labeled dextrans FD-4 and FD-70, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Sigma. The phospholipids of PC, phosphatidylserine (PS), PG, and PA used in this study were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids. Because these phospholipids contain palmitoyl-oleoyl fatty acyl chains, they are named POPC, POPS, POPG and POPA, respectively. CTX A3 and CTX A5 were purified by SP-Sephadex C-25 ion exchange chromatography followed by HPLC on a reverse phase C-18 column from crude venom of N. atra (Snake's education farms, Tainan, Taiwan) previously described (7Chien K.Y.

Vesicle Preparation—Lipids were dried under vacuum overnight and then hydrated with 10 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl. The suspension was frozen and thawed several times and was successively extruded through a polycarbonate filter with the pore size of 0.1 μm for obtaining homogeneous large unilamellar vesicles.

Chemical Modification of Methionine—Chemical modification of methionine residues was performed as described (19Carlsson F.H. Int. J. Biochem. 1987; 19: 915-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. Briefly, 1 mm CTX A3 in 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 2.5) containing 6 m guanidine-HCl was reacted with 10 mm iodoacetamide at room temperature. The reaction was monitored by analytical reverse phase HPLC followed by mass spectrometry. Two single- and one double-alkylated product could typically be obtained from this reaction. Each product was further characterized by mass spectrometry after CNBr cleavage and subsequent reduction of disulfide bonds. The identified various alkylated forms of CTXs were separated and purified by reverse phase HPLC. Vesicle Leakage—Release of vesicle contents was detected by 6-CF fluorescence intensity. Although 6-CF displays low fluorescence intensity at high concentration, its intensity increases sharply at low concentrations. Vesicles containing 6-CF were incubated at a final volume of 1 ml of buffer in a 1 × 1-cm quartz cuvette. After the addition of CTX, the fluorescence intensity was monitored as a function of time for the CTX-induced vesicle leakage process. The 6-CF leakage was calculated using the following expression: leakage % = (Ft – Fi)/(Ff – Fi), where Fi is the initial fluorescence before adding proteins, Ft is the fluorescence reading at time t, and Ff is the final fluorescence determined by adding Triton 0.02% (4Chien K.-Y. Huang W.N. Jean J.-H. Wu W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3252-3259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The excited and emitted wavelengths were 480 and 520 nm, respectively. Pore Size Determination—Fluorescein dextran/IgG-containing vesicle (1.2 mm and 50 μl) were treated either with Triton X-100, to determine the ratio of entrapped molecules, or with CTX A3, to examine differential molecule release. After 20 min, treated vesicle was applied to a 45 × 0.5-cm CL-4B column with an elution rate of 6 ml/h. The elution profile was determined by a Hitachi F1050 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 490 and 530 nm, respectively. To estimate the fraction of released molecules, a best-fit Gaussian curve was used to determine the area of elution profiles. When the leakage fraction was relatively small and the best-fit Gaussian curve was difficult to obtain, the leakage fraction was determined by the peak height of elution profile. We assume the released fraction corresponds to Ii = Ioi(1 – exp(–Ri)) where Ii, Ioi, and Ri were the released amount, total amount, and intrinsic leakage factor of different marker i, respectively. The selectivity was defined by the ratio of intrinsic leakage factor of co-encapsulated markers,Selectivity=RFD−4RFD−70=ln(1−IFD−4/IOFD−4)ln(1−IFD−70/IOFD−70) where IFD and IOFD were estimated by elution profiles after treatment with different concentrations of CTX A3 and Triton 0.8%, respectively. Crystallography—Crystals of CTX A3 in complex with SDS, belonging to P21212 space group with cell parameters of a = 74.90 Å, b = 76.20 Å, and c = 47.78 Å, were grown by the hanging drop method. One μl of the protein solution (10 mg/ml) was mixed with 1 μl of reservoir solution containing 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.6), 20% polyethylene glycol 400, 3% glycerol, and 24 mm SDS, which is well above its critical micelle concentration (7–10 mm). Crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen followed by cryo-data collection on an R-Axis IV imaging plate mounted on a Rigaku RU 300-rotating anode and subsequent data processing using DENZO (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38231) Google Scholar). The structure was solved by the molecular replacement method using the crystal structure of CTXγ (accession code 1TGX) as the search model. Using AMoRe (21Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5026) Google Scholar), the initial solution containing three molecules in the asymmetric unit had an R-factor of 40%. After manually adjusting the position of L2, which significantly differed from that of the model (1TGX), as revealed by omit map of residues 26–34, and the addition of SDS and water molecules, the R-factor dropped to about 30%. Because the L2 of each molecule in the asymmetric unit adopts a different conformation, non-crystallographic symmetry was not imposed during refinement, for which CNS (22Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

The current model with R-factor and R-free values of 22 and 27.75% from 30- to 1.9-Å resolution (Table I) was obtained after several iterative cycles of CNS refinement. PROCHECK (24Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thorton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) showed that 85.6% of the residues are in the most favored region with the remaining residues in the additional favored region.

Open table in a new tab Fluorescence Labeling—CTX (0.2 mm) was mixed with rhodamine B isothiocyanate (0.4 mm) in the presence of 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 6 m guanidine-HCl. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 12 h, and the resulting fluorescence-conjugated CTX was purified by HPLC. Single fluorescent probe-conjugated CTX was further identified using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (Quatro Ultima, MicroMass). For characterization of the conjugated position on CTX, the sample was dissolved in 100% trifluoroacetic acid at 40 °C for 20 min to obtain conjugated amino acids of CTX and the subsequent molecular weight verified by mass spectrometry. Concentrations of fluorescence-labeled and unlabeled CTX were determined using extinction coefficients of [epsis ]558 = 105,000 m–1cm–1 for rhodamine B-conjugated CTX A3, [epsis ]276 = 4185 m–1cm–1 for CTX A3, and [epsis ]276 = 2813 m–1cm–1 for CTX A5. For each experiment, only N-terminal fluorescence-conjugated CTXs were used. Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR FTIR) Experiments—ATR-FTIR spectra were collected at ambient temperature using a Bomem DA 8.3 FTIR system with a liquid nitrogen-cooled MCT detector. The internal reflection element was a zinc-selenium ATR plate (50 × 5 × 2 mm, Harrick, Ossining, NY) with an aperture angle of 45°. The ATR plates were washed with alcohol and deionized water and cleaned by plasma cleaner (Harrick) for the generation of clean and damp surface. CTX (20 μg), dissolved in D2O solution in the absence and presence of lipids (40 μg), was dried on the surface of the ATR plate and sealed in a D2O-saturated sample holder. The spectra (200 scans) were recorded at a spectral resolution of 2 cm–1 with triangular apodization. Fourier self-deconvolution was calculated, with the optimal parameter of 14–1 cm for the half-width of undeconvolution band and 2.2 for the resolution enhancement factor K, as previously described (25Lin Y.H. Huang W.N. Lee S.C. Wu W. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 2000; 27: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Homotransfer—The steady-state fluorescence spectra for the determination of CTX oligomerization upon binding to anionic lipids were obtained on an SLM-4800 fluorescence spectrometer with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 550 and 580 nm, respectively. Fluorescence-labeled and unlabeled CTX were mixed in an appropriate molar ratio, as shown in Fig. 2, in the presence of 10 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl. The final concentration of both proteins was maintained at 0.1 μm. Upon the addition of anionic lipids vesicles (30 μm) to fluorescence-labeled CTX, the fluorescence intensity spontaneously decreased as a result of the fluorescence energy homotransfer (self-quenching) during the oligomerization process. The effect of self-quenching became less if the intrinsic CTX was added to dilute the fluorescence-labeled CTX (26Runnels L.W. Scarlata S.F. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1569-1583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 27Sharpe J.C. Landon E. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 171: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at 25 °C. Anionic Lipid-induced Oligomerization and Membrane Pore Formation of CTX A3—Although P-type CTXs are known to bind to micelles of zwitterionic lipid or membrane vesicles of sphingomyelin, their interaction with PC membranes at liquid crystalline state causes no detectable lytic effect (green line, Fig. 1B). However, introduction of acidic lipids such as PS into the model membrane leads to a significant CTX A3-induced leakage of 6-CF fluorescence probe (red and black lines, Fig. 1B). In contrast, despite stronger interaction of CTX A5 than CTX A3 with the PC membranes, there is no detectable CTX A5-induced leakage even in vesicles with 100% PS (blue line, Fig. 1B). That similar CTX-induced vesicle leakage can also be observed for vesicles formed by PG, PA, or sulfatide suggests electrostatic interactions between anionic lipids and cationic CTX A3 play a role in the CTX-induced leakage of negatively charged membranes. Concentration-dependent study of the effect of CTX A3-induced leakage further reveals a bimolecular interaction of CTX A3 might be involved since the initial leakage rate of the process depends on the square of the CTX A3 concentration (Fig. 1C and the inset). CTX A3-induced membrane leakage may stem from formation of a toxin pore and/or its direct lytic action on membranes; both mechanisms require membrane-induced toxin oligomerization. To investigate whether the CTX A3 and CTX A5 molecules oligomerize in the presence of anionic lipid membranes, fluorescence energy transfer experiments were performed in the presence of rhodamine-labeled CTX A3 (Rh-CTX A3), or CTX A5 (Rh-CTX A5). If Rh-CTX is a monomer near the membrane surface, dilution of the Rh-CTX with the intrinsic CTX molecules could cause no change in the fluorescence intensity (black dashed line in Fig. 2). Conversely, if Rh-CTX exists as either dimer or oligomer upon dilution of Rh-CTX with intrinsic CTX, the efficiency of fluorescence energy transfer among Rh-CTXs would decrease. Theoretical consideration of the quantitative effect of fluorescence energy transfer suggests a linear decrease for the CTX dimer and an even faster decrease for the CTX oligomer (Fig. 2A). Quantitative analysis of the result indicates that although CTX A3 forms oligomer (>dimer) in the presence of negatively charged lipids (green line in Fig. 2A), CTX A5 forms only dimer (Fig. 2B). This in turn suggests an interactive relationship between oligomerization and membrane leakage in the case of CTX A3. To see whether membrane pore formation of CTX A3 indeed occurs near the anionic lipid membrane surface, we ask whether the CTX-induced leakage of the co-entrapped fluorescence probe exhibits selectivity toward molecules with different sizes. Although Triton-treated PS vesicles allow the complete leakage of the fluorescently labeled dextran probe of both FD-70 (Mr = 50.7 kDa) and FD-4 (Mr = 4.4 kDa) (green line in Fig. 3A), CTX A3-treated PS vesicles retain more of FD-70. FD-70 has been suggested to be a prolate ellipsoid (28Bohrer M.P. Deen W.M. Robertson C.R. Troy J.L. Brenner B.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 74: 583-593Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Based on the short axis of dextran, it is estimated that the lower limit of the pore size is ∼20 Å (17Ladokhin A.S. Selsted M.E. White S.H. Biophys J. 1997; 72: 1762-1766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The selectivity value of CTX-induced pore was determined to be ∼1.8 ± 0.3, which was smaller than that of melittin-treated in POPC vesicles. This result implies that the size or lifetime of the CTX-induced pore is larger or longer than that of the melittin-induced pore. Because all co-entrapped IgG remained within the CTX A3-treated vesicles (Fig. 3B), the result further suggests an upper limit for the size of the pore is ∼100 Å, which corresponds to the diameter of an IgG molecule (29Sarma V.R. Silverton E.W. Davies D.R. Terry W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 3753-3759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the aforementioned result, we conclude that the anionic lipid may induce the oligomerization of CTX A3 near the membrane surface and formation of a pore with a size ranging between 20 and 100 Å. Because the interaction of CTX with other anionic lipid such as cardiolipin also induces the formation of well defined membrane particles, presumably inverted micelles, as its fusion intermediates, it is desirable to obtain a high resolution structure to understand the mechanism responsible for the CTX action on phospholipid membranes. We consequently co-crystallized CTX A3 with anionic lipid of SDS and determined its three-dimensional structure at 1.9-Å resolution. Overall Structure of CTX A3—There are three crystallographically unrelated CTX A3 molecules in an asymmetric unit; each molecule forms a dimer with its closest neighbor from an adjacent asymmetric unit. The crystal structure of CTX A3 contains five β-sheets comprising residues 2–4 (β1), 11–13 (β2), 20–26 (β3), 35–39 (β4), and 49–54 (β5). The three functional loops are formed by residues 4–11 (L1), 26–35 (L2), and 39–49 (L3) (Fig. 1A). The Cα structural overlay of the three molecules in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 4A) reveals that the most significant structural variation between monomers occurs at the tip of L2. Two monomeric (blue and magenta in Fig. 4A) L2s adopt similar conformations, with each bound to an SDS head group, whereas the L2 of the third CTX A3 molecule (green in Fig. 4A) has a conformation that closely resembles that of the molecule in solution determined by 1H NMR (yellow in Fig. 4A) (11Sue S.C. Jarrell H.C. Brisson J.R. Wu W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12782-12794Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 30Bhaskaran R. Huang C.C. Chang D.K. Yu C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1291-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This suggests that L2 undergoes a local and specific conformational change in the presence of SDS. CTX A3 contains only two acidic residues, Asp-40 and Asp-57, of which the side chain of Asp-40 is exposed to the solvent, and the OD1 of Asp-57 hydrogen bond with the NH of Lys-2. The latter observation is consistent with fluorescence data generated from a study into the effect of the mutation of Asp-57 to Asn on the unfolding process of CTXs (31Lo C.C. Hsu J.H. Shen Y.C. Chiang C.M. Wu W. Fann W. Tsao P.H. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 2382-2388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Interactions of a CTX A3 Monomer with SDS Molecules—In the current structure, 10 SDS molecules were found to interact with 3 CTX A3 monomers in the asymmetric unit. Although any of the positively charged amino acids distributed throughout the slightly curved surface of CTX A3 can potentially interact with the SDS sulfate head groups, those residing on or near the three loops are found to be involved in the CTX A3-SDS interactions (Figs. 4B and 5A). Interestingly, the toxin backbone of 2 amino acid triads, Lys-5-Leu-6–Val-7 and Thr-29–Pro-30–Lys-31, from the respective L1 and L2 are also important contributors in CTX A3-SDS interactions, as each adopts a conformation that wraps around the SDS sulfate moiety (see SDS 2 and 4 in Fig. 4B). Consistent with previous biochemical and NMR studies in aqueous solution, the mode of the CTX A3-SDS interaction observed in the crystal implies that the three loops, L1-L3, initiate the CTX A3-membrane interaction. However, the current structure provides a molecular model on how negatively charged lipids may interact with the positively charged amino acids flanking the three hydrophobic loops that enhance the CTX-membrane interactions. Although all the three loops interact with SDS, they differ in the intensity of their interaction, with L2 providing the"

Treatment of human hepatocytes with either naturally occurring (chenodeoxycholic acid) or synthetic (GW4064) FXR ligands resulted in both induction of SDC1 mRNA and enhanced binding, internalization, and degradation of low density lipoprotein. Transient transfection assays, using wild-type and mutant SDC1 promoter-luciferase genes, led to the identification of a nuclear hormone receptor-binding hexad arranged as a direct repeat separated by one nucleotide (DR-1) in the proximal promoter that was necessary and sufficient for activation by FXR. The wild-type, but not a mutated DR-1 element, conferred FXR responsiveness to a heterologous thymidine kinase promoter-reporter gene. Four murine FXR isoforms have been identified recently that differ either at their amino terminus and/or by the presence or absence of four amino acids in the hinge region. Interestingly, the activities of the human SDC1 promoter-reporter constructs were highly induced by the two FXR isoforms that do not contain the four-amino acid insert and were unresponsive to the isoforms containing the four amino acids. Thus, current studies demonstrate that hepatic SDC1 is induced in an FXR isoform-specific manner. Increased expression of SDC1 may account in part for the hypotriglyceridemic effect that can result from the administration of chenodeoxycholic acid to humans.

A number of these nuclear receptors have been shown to undergo a conformational change upon binding ligand that promotes the release of co-repressor proteins and the subsequent recruitment of co-activator proteins; the net result is increased transcription of the target gene (3Nolte R.T.

The most potent of these natural ligands is the primary bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). These unexpected results extended our understanding of bile acids beyond their traditional roles in the solubilization and absorption of dietary lipids and fat-soluble vitamins to a new class of hormonal ligands that play key roles in gene expression. Recently, four murine and human FXR isoforms (FXRα1, α2, β1, and β2) were identified that are derived from a single gene as a result of alternative promoter usage and alternative splicing of the mRNA (10Zhang Y.

The FXRβ isoforms have an extended amino terminus with respect to the FXRα isoforms. In addition, FXRα2 and FXRβ2 contain a four-amino acid insert in the hinge region that is absent from both FXRα1 and FXRβ1 (10Zhang Y. Kast-Woelbern H.R. Edwards P.A. J. Biol.

Targeted deletion of FXR in a murine model revealed an important role for FXR in cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis because the FXR null mouse was unable to respond normally to diets enriched in fat, cholesterol, or bile acids (12Sinal C.J.

The observation that plasma triglyceride levels declined when rodents were treated with either a synthetic (GW4064) (21Maloney P.R. Parks D.J. Haffner C.D. Fivush A.M. Chandra G. Plunket K.D.

Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1720-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) is consistent with the hypothesis that activation of FXR modulates lipoprotein levels. The observation that administration of a cholesterol-rich diet to FXR null mice results in elevated serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides and increased levels of proatherogenic lipoproteins provides additional support for this hypothesis (12Sinal C.J. Tohkin M. Miyata M. Ward J.M. Lambert G. Gonzalez F.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 731-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that activated FXR results in increased metabolism of plasma lipoproteins. SDC1 is a member of the syndecan family of transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycans, which are widely expressed in partially overlapping patterns of expression in many cell types and tissues (22Kim C.W. Goldberger O.A. Gallo R.L. Bernfield M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 23Carey D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Their principal function appears to be to modulate the ligand-dependent activation of primary signaling receptors at the cell surface leading to an increase in binding and/or internalization of extracellular ligands (23Carey D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). SDC1 is highly expressed in the liver, where heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) bind to lipoproteins via a number of bridging proteins that include lipoprotein lipase (LPL) (24Williams K.J. Fless G.M. Petrie K.A. Snyder M.L. Brocia R.W. Swenson T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13284-13292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), apoE (25Ji Z.S. Brecht W.J. Miranda R.D. Hussain M.M. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10160-10167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and hepatic lipase (26Ji Z.S. Lauer S.J. Fazio S. Bensadoun A. Taylor J.M. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13429-13436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies (27Mahley R.W. Ji Z.S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have detailed an important role for such binding in the hepatic clearance of lipoprotein remnants. The HSPGs on the hepatocyte cell surface are thought to bind to and sequester remnants prior to their transfer to specific receptors such as LDL receptor and LDL receptor-related protein and subsequent endocytosis. Support for this proposal comes from the following observations: (i) apoE- or LPL-enhanced internalization of remnant-like lipoproteins is abolished by either enzymatic or genetic removal of HSPGs from the cell surface (24Williams K.J. Fless G.M. Petrie K.A. Snyder M.L. Brocia R.W. Swenson T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13284-13292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Ji Z.S. Brecht W.J. Miranda R.D. Hussain M.M.

Brecht W.J. Miranda R.D. Hussain M.M. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10160-10167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A role for the independent transport of lipoprotein remnants or LDL into hepatocytes by SDC1, in the absence of other receptors, has also been described (28Williams K.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 171: 457-477PubMed Google Scholar, 29Williams K.J. Fuki I.V. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Importantly, Fuki et al. (30Fuki I.V.

Meyer M.E. Williams K.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) showed that transfection of Chinese hamster ovary cells with an expression vector for SDC1 led to a significant increase in the catabolism of lipoproteins enriched in LPL and that chimeric FcR-SDC1 receptors could internalize IgG in the absence of endogenous IgG receptors. However, the relative contribution of SDC1, LDL receptor, and LDL receptor-related protein to remnant/lipoprotein clearance in vivo awaits further investigation. In the current study, we demonstrate that treatment of either primary human hepatocytes or cells derived from human hepatomas with FXR ligands results in increased expression of SDC1 mRNA and increased cellular binding, uptake, and degradation of both LDL and a preformed LDL·LPL complex. The current studies suggest that ligands for FXR increase the expression of the SDC1 gene and result in enhanced processing and clearance of lipoproteins.

HuH7 cells were maintained in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Primary human hepatocytes were obtained from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD) and were cultured on Matrigel-coated 6-well plates at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells per well. Culture media consisted of serum-free Williams' E medium supplemented with 100 nm dexamethasone, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Hybridization—Unless otherwise indicated, HepG2 and HuH7 cells were cultured in medium containing superstripped FBS for 24 h before the addition of ligands or Me2SO (vehicle) for an additional 8–24 h. Primary human hepatocytes were cultured in growth medium with the addition of 1 μm GW4064 or Me2SO (vehicle) for 8 or 12 h. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent and was resolved (5–10 μg/lane) on a 1% agarose, 2.2 m formaldehyde gel, transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond N+; Amersham Biosciences), and cross-linked to the membrane with UV light. cDNA probes were radiolabeled with [32P]dCTP using the Rediprime™II labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were hybridized using the QuikHyb hybridization solution (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Blots were normalized for variations of RNA loading by hybridization to a control probe, either 18 S ribosomal cDNA or the ribosomal protein 36B4. The RNA levels were quantitated using a PhosphorImager (ImageQuant software; Amersham Biosciences). Reporter Genes—The human SDC1 proximal promoter (-1298 to +53) was amplified from the human BAC Clone RP11-202B22 and cloned into KpnI/NheI sites of the pGL3 basic vector (Promega). The -1298/+53 and -937/+53 constructs containing either a wild-type or mutant DR-1 element were generated using the common 3′ primer (5′-ggggctagcgctctctactgccggattcc-3′) and a 5′ primer with a sequence of either 5′-acacggtaccggtcaaacaggtgctcagg-3′-(1298), 5′-acacggtaccgggcccgtccggttcttcccctttgctctctcggccgtttcc-3′-(937 wt), or 5′- acacggtaccgggcccgtccggttctcccccctccctctctcggccgtttcc-3′-(937 mut).

After 3.5 h, the cells were treated with 10% charcoal/dextran-treated “superstripped” FBS (ss-FBS) (Hyclone, UT) (and one of the following ligands: CDCA, LG100153 (synthetic RXR agonist), 3-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-4-(3′-carboxy-2-chloro-stilben-4-yl)-oxymethyl-5-isopropyl-isoxazole (GW 4064)). The cells were lysed, and the luciferase activities were normalized to β-galactosidase activity (32Kast H.R. Goodwin B. Tarr P.T. Jones S.A. Anisfeld A.M. Stoltz C.M. Tontonoz P. Kliewer S.

Unprogrammed lysate was prepared using the pCMX vector. Binding reactions contained 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 60 mm KCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 6% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 2.5 μl of each receptor protein. Control incubations received unprogrammed lysate alone. Reactions were preincubated on ice for 30 min prior to the addition of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe (0.2 pmol). Competitor oligonucleotides were added to the preincubation at a 50-, 100-, or 500-fold molar excess. Samples were held on ice for a further 5 min, and the protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a pre-electrophoresed 5% polyacrylamide gel in 1× TBE (45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA) at 4 °C. Gels were dried and autoradiographed at -70 °C for 8 h.

As a model ligand, we used LPL-enriched 125I-labeled methylated LDL (LPL/125I-mLDL), which binds HSPGs but does not interact with the LDL receptor. The LPL was purified from cows' milk by heparin-agarose chromatography (28Williams K.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 171: 457-477PubMed Google Scholar). The 125I-mLDL was prepared from fresh human plasma by ultracentrifugation (1.019 < d < 1.063 g/ml), radioiodination, and finally reductive methylation of ∼35% of the lysyl residues to abolish LDL receptor binding (28Williams K.J.

The cells were then incubated for 24 h in MEM/ss-FBS that was supplemented with either 1.0 μm GW4064 or the corresponding volume of Me2SO. Cells that received GW4064 remained exposed to this agent for the remainder of the experiment. To examine proteoglycan-mediated catabolism of lipoproteins, cells were placed into serum-free MEM, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, supplemented with 5 μg of 125I-mLDL protein/ml, with or without GW4064, and either 5 μg of LPL/ml or the corresponding volume of lipase buffer. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 5 h in these media, after which the surface-bound (assessed by the radioactivity released at 4 °C by 10 mg of heparin/ml), intracellular (heparin-resistant), and degraded (assessed by trichloroacetic acid-soluble, CHCl3-insoluble radioactivity in media) lipoproteins were quantitated (28Williams K.J.

Induction of SDC1 by Bile Acids and the Synthetic FXR Ligand GW4064 —In an effort to identify target genes that are regulated by the bile acid receptor FXR, HepG2 cells were infected with retroviral vectors that express either rat FXRα2 and the neomycin-resistant gene or the neomycin-resistant gene alone (20Kast H.R.

DAT uptake of dopamine-selective neurotoxins such as 6-hydroxydopamine and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium is central to the cell type specificity of these model toxins for parkinsonian neurodegeneration. DAT is the most selective current marker for selected populations of dopaminergic neurons. It is expressed only in dopaminergic cells, with relatively high levels of expression in substantia nigra pars compacta neurons, intermediate levels in ventral tegmental area dopaminergic neurons, and low levels in arcuate nucleus neurons. These features, and the high affinity with which DAT can recognize cocaine analogs, have led to use of in vitro and in vivo assessments of DAT binding to seek evidence for degeneration of dopaminergic systems (5Kugaya A. Fujita M. Innis R.B. Ann. Nucl. Med. 2000; 14: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Cocaine analog binding to DAT in vitro or in vivo can each reveal reduced DAT binding in Parkinson's disease brains (6Kim Y.J. Ichise M. Ballinger J.R. Vines D. Erami S.S. Tatschida T. Lang A.E.

The decline in specific DAT binding of 2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-[123I]iodophenyl) tropane (123Iβ-CIT) in SPECT studies has correlated well with progression of Parkinson's disease symptoms (7Varrone A. Marek K.L. Jennings D. Innis R.B. Seibyl J.P. Movement Disorders. 2001; 16: 1023-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). DAT functions including its velocity of dopamine transport and its expression on plasma membranes can be regulated by several kinase or phosphatase pathways. DAT activity can be altered by activation of protein kinase C (PKC), Ca2+, arachidonic acid cascades (9Kitayama S. Dohi T. Uhl G.R. Eur. J.

Few treatments alter the affinity of DAT for cocaine analogs. We and others have demonstrated DAT phosphorylation. [32P]Orthophosphate labels DAT proteins in expressing COS cells, LLC-PK1 cells (11Huff R.A. Vaughan R.A. Kuhar M.J. Uhl G.R. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15541-15546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Increased 32P labeling correlates with decreased Vmax in some experiments. Antiphosphoserine antibodies can recognize DAT in striatal Western blots (16Vrindavanam N.S. Arnaud P. Ma J.X. Altman-Hamamdzic S. Parratto N.P. Sallee F.R. Neurosci.

Despite evidence for functionally important regulation by kinase pathways, little evidence documents which pathways work at which DAT sites to alter phosphoregulation, alter DAT disposition in cells, and/or change DAT dopamine translocation Vmax. Current DAT modeling supports a 12-transmembrane (TM) topology that localizes potential phosphoacceptor sites to intracellular N- and C-terminal domains and the five putative cytoplasmic loops that connect TM domains (17Kilty J.

To identify kinase pathways important for regulation of DAT expression and function, we have first characterized the influences on DAT expression and function that are exerted by drugs that change activities in several kinase pathways. To identify which potential phosphoacceptor sites might harbor DAT sequences important for DAT regulation, we have assessed modifications of these kinase pathway influences induced by 21 DAT mutations or deletions that alter potential DAT phosphoacceptor sites (Fig. 1). Influences of several kinase pathway agents on DAT functions can be attenuated by removal of several potential DAT phosphoacceptor sites, especially those in its N-terminal domain. We also describe evidence for differential effects of phosphorylation on DAT distribution and function. These data have a number of implications, including cautions in interpreting DAT images obtained after treatments that alter phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) or mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase 1 and 2 (MEK1/2) kinase pathways. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), LY29402 hydrochloride, U0126, SB202190, okadaic acid, and KN-62 were purchased from Tocris Cookson, Inc.

Neumeyer. Other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Alanine substitution mutants in the rat DAT cDNA (18Shimada S. Kitayama S. Lin C. Patel A. Nanthakumar E. Gregor P. Kuhar M. Uhl G.R. Science. 1991; 254: 576-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar) were prepared as described previously (22Lin Z. Itokawa M. Uhl G.R. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 715-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Combination mutants S7A/T62A/S261A, T62A/S261A/T338A, S7A/S261A/T338A, S7A/T62A/T338A, and S7A/T62A/S261A/T338A were generated as follows. Double mutations S7A/T62A (located on a NotI/BglII fragment) and S261A/T338A (located on a BglII/PvuI fragment) were made by annealing two mutagenic oligonucleotides simultaneously to the single strand template during the procedure (22Lin Z. Itokawa M. Uhl G.R. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 715-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Because S7A and T62A are each located on the NotI/BglII fragment and because S261A and T338A are each located on the BglII/PvuI fragment, DNA recombinations of these two cDNA fragments with the corresponding mutations produced the above five combination mutants. N-terminally deleted DAT was prepared by shuttling a PCR product that carried the NotI/BglII fragment with a deletion of the 12 codons coding for Ser-2 to Ser-13 of DAT into the rat DAT (rDAT) cDNA. The two primers used were 5′-GGGGGCGGCCGCATGGTGGTGGCCCCGGCTAAAGAGTCC-3′ and 5′-GCCCATGCGATGATGACATT-3′; the wild type cDNA was the template. All mutant DNA fragments were confirmed by sequencing. Dopamine uptake was assessed in COS cells transiently expressing wild type and mutant DATs in pcDNA3.1+ as described previously (22Lin Z. Itokawa M. Uhl G.R. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 715-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were assayed for their abilities to accumulate 2.5 μm [3H]dopamine (initially 10 nm, 56 Ci/mmol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) adjusted using unlabeled dopamine) with or without treatments with PMA (1 μm) or MAP kinase inhibitors (50 μm) at 37 °C for 30 min. These pretreatments caused only negligible cell detachment from the assay wells. Assessments of protein in the wells before and after treatments revealed no changes. Drugs were also included in the corresponding [3H]dopamine uptake buffers. Kinetic and saturation analyses were used to determine Km and Vmax values as modified from Pfenning and Richelson (23Pfenning M.A. Richelson E. Yamamura H.I. Enna S.J. Kuhar M.J.

After transfection, cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 800 μg/ml geneticin (Invitrogen) for selection of expressing cells. DAT-positive cells were identified by immunohistochemical staining (24Lin Z. Wang W. Kopajtic T. Revay R.S. Uhl G.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 434-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). DAT-positive cell lines were obtained by 2–3 rounds of subcloning and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 400 μg/ml geneticin (25Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 9.5.1-9.5.6Google Scholar). In each stable cell line, >95% of the cells showed DAT-positive staining. Immunohistochemistry—DAT expression patterns in COS cells were examined by immunohistochemistry as described using antiserum 16B for every mutant except one (24Lin Z. Wang W. Kopajtic T. Revay R.S. Uhl G.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 434-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For the mutant (S45A) located within the peptide against which serum 16B was raised, the rabbit anti-DAT C-terminal serum 18A (26Vaughan R. Uhl G.R. Kuhar M.J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1993; 4: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) was used. Cell Surface Biotinylation—The surface expression of the wild type DAT proteins was monitored by a biotinylation procedure modified from Ref. 27Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar. 5 × 105 LLC-PK1 cells in 6-well plate wells were briefly washed twice with PBS containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 mm CaCl2 (PBS/Mg2+/ Ca2+, pH 8.0). For kinase effector treatments, cells were incubated with drugs at 37 °C for 30 min as indicated in the figure legends. Plates were incubated at 4 °C for 5 min; cells were washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold PBSMg2+/Ca2+ to remove drugs, and cells were incubated with 0.4 ml of PBSMg2+/Ca2+ containing NHS-SS-biotin (1.5 mg/ml, Pierce) and Me2SO (0.2%) at 4 °C with gentle agitation for 40 min. NHS-SS-biotin solution was aspirated, and the remaining NHS-SS-biotin was quenched by incubating cells with 1 ml of 0.15 m glycine in PBSMg2+/Ca2+ at 4 °C for 20 min. Cells were lysed by adding 50 μl of SDS lysis buffer/well and suspended into an additional 0.45 ml of non-SDS lysis buffer using a cell scraper. 0.5 ml of the resulting suspension was transferred into an Eppendorf tube and centrifuged at 12,000 × g in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C for 15 min to remove cell debris. The supernatant was incubated for 14 h at 4 °C with 50 μl of streptavidin-agarose bead slurry (Pierce) with occasional mixing to resuspend the beads. Beads were washed at 4 °C with non-SDS lysis buffer, high salt solution, and then 1 ml of 50 mm TrisOAc (pH 7.6). Beads were suspended in 30 μl of 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to release proteins, and 30 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer was added. Western Blotting—Proteins in the SDS sample buffer were heated at 80 °C for 10 min, resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to PVDF membranes (25Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 9.5.1-9.5.6Google Scholar). DAT was recognized with primary antibody 16B diluted 1:2000 and secondary anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with horse-radish peroxidase diluted 1:5000, using an ECL plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). To provide a control, protein phosphatase α1 (PPα1, the catalytic subunit of serine/threonine phosphatase) in LLC-PK1 cells was detected using the rabbit anti-PPα1 sera (Calbiochem) diluted 1:1000. For PPα1 assays with whole cells, LLC-PK1 cells were washed twice with 1 ml of PBS to remove the medium, dissolved in 1× sample buffer, and heated at 80 °C for 10 min before analyses using 10% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Protein Staining on PVDF Membranes—India ink staining of proteins, displaying a good dynamic range (28Hancock K. Tsang V.C. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 133: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), was used to quantify the small (<100 ng per band) amounts of protein on PVDF membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes from Western blots were washed in PBS containing 0.3% Tween 20 (PBST, 5 ml/cm2) at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by two PBS washes at 22 °C. Proteins on the membranes were visualized by staining in PBST containing 0.1% india ink (2 ml/cm2; Higgins India Ink, Sanford Co., Bellwood, IL) at 22 °C for 8 h. Membranes were destained briefly by two 5-min washes in 5 ml/cm2 PBST and air-dried. Immunofluorescence Assay—DAT/LLC-PK1 cells were grown on coverslips. After fixation in 2% paraformaldehyde, cells were rinsed twice with PBS containing 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2 and blocked with augmented TBS (TBS with 2% skim milk powder, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.01% sodium azide) for 1 h at room temperature. Blocking solution was removed; cells were rinsed once with TBST (TBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mm MgCl2/0.1 mm CaCl2), and cells were incubated with the primary anti-DAT serum 16B diluted 1:20,000 in TBST for 1 h. The primary antibody was aspirated; cells were washed 4 times with TBST for 7 min per incubation, and cells were incubated with secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H & L), Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, diluted 1:200 in TBST) for 1 h. Secondary antibodies were removed; cells were washed 4 times with TBST (7-min incubations each) and once with PBS, and coverslips were mounted onto slides using the ProLong Antifade kit (Molecular Probes) and allowed to air-dry in darkness for overnight. Coverslips were sealed with Clarion nailpolish, and fluorescence images were obtained via a Zeiss LSM 410 Invert Laser Scan Microscope system, at excitation/emission of 488/515. z-sections were obtained at a half of the cell height. LLC-PK1 cells stably expressing wild type and mutant rDAT cDNAs were grown to near-confluence in 6-well plates, rinsed once with 1 ml of phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and incubated in the same solution 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were rinsed twice with 1 ml of PBS and incubated at 30 °C for 90 min in labeling Krebs-Ringer-Henseleit medium containing 125 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 5.6 mm glucose, 1.3 mm CaCl2, pH 7.3, 1 μm okadaic acid, and 1 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphorus. Cells were then treated for 30 min with either 0.2% Me2SO or 50 μm concentrations of test drug in the same medium containing 0.2% Me2SO. Labeling medium was removed; cells were rinsed once with 1 ml of ice-cold labeling Krebs-Ringer-Henseleit containing 1 μm okadaic acid, and cells were scraped into ice-cold sucrose-phosphate (SP) buffer containing 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.32 m sucrose, 1 μm okadaic acid, and 1× protease inhibitor set I. Cells were homogenized by passing through 22-gauge needles 10 times; lysates were centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min; supernatants were recentrifuged at 325,000 × g for 20 min, and pellet membrane proteins were solubilized in 500 μl of solubilization buffer containing PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm disodium pyrophosphate, 1 μm okadaic acid, and 1× protease inhibitor set I by resuspension and rotation of the tubes at 4 °C for 1 h. 10 μl of a 50% protein A-Sepharose CL 4B bead slurry was added to solubilized samples; samples were rotated at 4 °C for 1 h and 5 μl of the suspension set aside for SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue protein estimations. The remaining slurry was incubated with 20 μl of anti-DAT/protein A-Sepharose CL 4B bead slurry, which was prepared by rotating protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads with rabbit anti-rDAT serum 16B. Slurry preparations were incubated with cleared membrane protein solution or with solubilization buffer only and rotated at 4 °C for 2 h. Beads were washed with 3× with 500 μl of solubilization buffer and proteins released from beads by 10-min 65 °C incubations in 30 μl of SDS sample buffer, and each sample was resolved on two parallel sets of 7% SDS-PAGE. One of each gel pair was dried for autoradiographic analysis, and proteins on the second parallel gel were transferred to a PVDF membrane for quantitation using india ink staining. LLC-PK1 proteins on PVDF membrane were used as a control for the amount of proteins loaded on the gels. Analyses—Quantitation of proteins as revealed by Western blotting, autoradiograph, or india ink staining was carried out using the Gel-Pro Analyzer version 3.1 software (MediaCybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Western blots were analyzed by dot-blots software and protein patterns on PVDF membranes by one-dimensional gel software. In lane profiles, base lines were defined by 20% filter diameters. Optical densities of protein bands were defined as profile values minus base-line values. The sum of the optical densities of all the detected bands in each lane represented relative protein amount loaded into that lane. The band detection sensitivity was set at 2% of the maximum band intensity. Vmax and Km values for [3H]dopamine uptake, calculation of data fitting, and t tests or ANOVAs followed by Tukey's multiple comparison tests used Prism version 3 programs (GraphPad Software, San Diego). Mutation effects on drug-induced Vmax reductions are defined as the differences between Vmax reductions identified in mutant and wild type DATs (see figure legends). Basal [3H]Dopamine Uptake Activity—Cells expressing wild type DAT displayed robust uptake of radiolabeled dopamine. Cells that expressed 18 of the 21 DAT mutants displayed uptake activities ≥60% of wild type values (Table I, first two columns). Val-14-deleted DAT displayed about one-fourth of this activity (n = 5). S333A and S421A mutants decreased uptake to less than 10% of wild type values. Conversely, S12A DAT had uptake activity 120% of wild type values.Table IMutational influence on alteration of dopamine uptake activity by protein kinase effectorsDATsaWild type (WT) and alanine substitution mutant DATs.

To determine possible functional single nucleotide polymorphisms within these elements, we determined the single nucleotide polymorphism distribution within 1,665 bp of the gelatinase A 5′-flanking region, using a healthy homogeneous Caucasian study group of 463 individuals. Among the polymorphisms detected, a G → A transition at bp –1575 was located immediately 5′ to a half-palindromic potential estrogen receptor binding site. In estrogen receptor-positive MCF-7 cells the –1575G allele functioned as an enhancer, whereas the –1575A allele reduced transcription activity significantly. Gel shift assays confirmed that the differences in allelic expression affected binding of the estrogen receptor-α to this region. Cotransfection experiments with an estrogen receptor-α expression vector in MDA-MB-231 cells, which do not constitutively express an estrogen receptor, revealed that estrogen receptor is absolutely required for enhancing activity. Allelic distribution analysis indicated that a previously reported C → T transition within an Sp1 binding site at –1306 was in linkage disequilibrium with the –1575G → A transition. Luciferase reporter studies of the linked variant –1575A –1306T allele versus the wild type –1575G –1306C allele demonstrated an additive reduction in estrogen-dependent reporter activity. The frequency of the –1575G → A transition deviated significantly from the expected Hardy-Weinberg distribution in two independently assembled study populations consisting of healthy adult blood donors and newborns of Caucasian origin, both with a calculated 21% reduction in genetic fitness. Gelatinase A is a known estrogen-responsive gene and the demonstration of a loss of function polymorphism within an operational estrogen receptor binding site associated with a decrease in genetic fitness underscores the biologic significance of promoter polymorphism analyses.

The individual components of the relatively large matrix metalloproteinase gene family play multiple roles in the interaction of cells with their surrounding extracellular matrix. As such, this family of evolutionarily conserved enzymes is intimately involved in the diverse physiologic processes that make up normal growth and development, as well as neoplasia, metastasis, angiogenesis, and tissue fibrosis. One member of the matrix metalloproteinase gene family, gelatinase A or matrix metalloproteinase-2, has received considerable attention as a mediator of tumor angiogenesis and metastatic capability (1Ray J.M.

In addition to the role of gelatinase A in malignancy, this enzyme has an important function in the normal growth and development of soft tissues. For example, gelatinase A-deficient mice develop normally but have significantly retarded growth rates (4Kato T. Kure T. Chang J.H. Gabison E.E. Itoh T. Itohara S. Azar D.T. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and diminished corneal and tumor neoangiogenesis (5Itoh T. Tanioka M. Yoshida H. Yoshioka T. Nishimoto H. Itohara S.

One form of the inherited osteolysis (vanishing bone) syndromes was recently found to be the result of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 1The abbreviations used are: SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism; CMV, cytomegalovirus; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift analysis; ERE, estrogen response element. 1The abbreviations used are: SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism; CMV, cytomegalovirus; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift analysis; ERE, estrogen response element. in the coding region of the gelatinase A gene, resulting in a phenotype characterized by an absolute lack of gelatinase A synthesis and severe growth and soft tissue deformities (6Martignetti J.A. Aqeel A.A. Sewairi W.A. Boumah C.E. Kambouris M. Mayouf S.A. Sheth K.V. Eid W.A. Dowling O. Harris J. Glucksman M.J. Bahabri S. Meyer B.F. Desnick R.J. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 202-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar).Although gelatinase A regulatory control has been frequently characterized as “constitutive” in nature, examination of gelatinase A patterns of expression during development or disease states is consistent with multiple levels of cellular control. For example, expression of gelatinase A during nephrogenesis, a classic model of branching morphogenesis, is highly regulated in both a spatial and temporal manner (7Tanney D.C. Feng L. Pollock A.S. Lovett D.H. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 213: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Given these considerations, several groups have attempted to define the transcriptional regulatory elements that provide the cellular- or tissue-specific levels of gelatinase A synthesis. These studies have been performed within both the rat and human genomic contexts and have characterized several motifs operative within defined cellular types (8Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Mertens P.R.

Chem. 1999; 274: 29130-29137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a proximal, overlapping binding site for transcription factors AP-2, Sp1, and Sp3 in the human gelatinase A promoter is responsible for high level gelatinase A transcription in glioblastoma cell lines. In contrast, Harendza et al. (8Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Mertens P.R. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18786-18796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) demonstrated little activity for this region within the context of glomerular mesangial cells and instead defined a potent, tissue-specific enhancer element (denoted RE-1) located between bp –1595 and –1555 relative to the transcriptional start site in the rat gelatinase A gene. A similar element in the human gelatinase A promoter, denoted r2 (bp –1657/–1619) was defined by Frisch and Morisaki (11Frisch S.M. Morisaki J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6524-6532Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and recent studies have demonstrated that this site specifically binds AP-2 and YB-1 complexes (14Mertens P.R. Alfonso-Jaume M.A. Steinmann K. Lovett D.H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 2480-2487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The human r2 and rat RE-1 enhancer elements also interact with the p53 protein, resulting in enhanced gelatinase A transcription (12Bian J. Sun Y. Mol. Cell.

The polymorphism within the gelatinase B promoter affected transcriptional activity and was associated with an increased risk of severe coronary atherosclerosis (17Zhang B. Ye S. Herrmann S.-M. Eriksson P. de Maat M. Evans A. Arbeiler D. Luc G. Cambien F. Hamsten A. Watkins H. Henney A.M. Circulation. 1999; 99: 1788-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar).Given the central role of gelatinase A in multiple physiologic and disease processes, the complexity of its regulatory control, and the examples provided by the interstitial collagenase and gelatinase B studies, we initiated an examination of the promoter region of the human gelatinase A gene for polymorphisms affecting transcriptional regulation. In particular, we wished to test the hypothesis that polymorphisms in the r2 enhancer region or the proximal overlapping AP-2/Sp1 binding site existed and thereby affected the transcriptional regulation of gelatinase A in growth and development or during disease processes. During the course of this study, Price et al. (19Price S.J. Greaves D.R. Watkins H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7549-7558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) reported on the distribution of polymorphisms in the human gelatinase A gene and focused on a functional allelic variant at bp –1306 which affected transcription factor Sp1 binding. Although we did not detect polymorphisms within the highly conserved r2 enhancer region, a G → A transition was mapped to bp –1575 which was immediately adjacent to a potential half-palindromic estrogen receptor binding site. In this report we detail the population distribution of the –1575G/A alleles, demonstrate specific interaction of this region with the estrogen receptor-α protein, and show that the –1575G → A transition, which is linked to the –1306C → T transition, impairs the transcriptional response of gelatinase A to estrogen receptor binding and is associated with a significant decrease in genetic fitness.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIsolation of Genomic DNA—Blood was collected in EDTA from 463 healthy Caucasian blood donors from Northern Germany and genomic DNA extracted using the QIAamp DNA Minikit (Qiagen). Samples were stored in 30-μl aliquots suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 5-μl aliquots were used as templates for PCR. Heel prick blood from 959 newborns of North German Caucasian origin was collected on standardized filter screening cards and processed as above.SNP Screening within the 5′-Regulatory Region of the Human Gelatinase A Gene—A set of eight primers was designed following the corrected sequence of Bian and Sun (12Bian J. Sun Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6330-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar; GenBank accession no. AJ298926). These priming pairs generated four PCR products spanning the region from bp –1to –1665 relative to the dominant transcriptional start site of the human gelatinase A gene (37Huhtala P. Chow L.T. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11077-11082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Individual PCR products from the genomic DNA from 20 randomly chosen blood donors were fully sequenced on an ABI 377 sequencer and compared with the original deposited sequence.Determination of Genotypes—To determine the genotypes for the two SNPs of interest, two genomic DNA fragments of the human gelatinase A 5′-untranslated region were amplified by PCR using the following flanking primer pairs: 5′-CACACCCACCAGACAAGCCT-3′ and 5′-TGGGGAATATGGGGAATGTT-3′ generates a 349-bp fragment (fragment A) spanning bp –1665 to –1317. The primer pair 5′-CCCAGCACTCTACCTCTTTA-3′ and 5′-TGGCAATGTGGGGAGGTTTA-3′ generates a 350-bp fragment (fragment B) spanning bp –1316 to –967. When the –1575A allele is present in fragment A, a RcaI restriction site is introduced which is not present in the wild type –1575G allele. When the –1059A allele is present in fragment B, a unique HhaI restriction site is eliminated from the wild type –1059G allele. This permitted restriction enzyme analysis of the PCR products for genotyping of individuals with RcaI for the –1575G/A polymorphism and with HhaI for the –1059G/A polymorphism. Allelic frequency and Hardy-Weinberg distributions were calculated using standard methodologies. To determine the extent of potential linkage disequilibrium between the –1575G/A and the functional Sp1 –1306C/T polymorphism, a randomly chosen subset of 100 samples from the initial pool of 463 subjects was sequenced directly through the –1306 bp region to the –1575 bp region.Cell Culture—Human breast carcinoma cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. For certain transfection experiments cells were grown for a week prior to transfection in phenol red-free RPMI 1640 medium along with 10% fetal calf serum pretreated with dextran-coated charcoal to remove steroid hormones (38Dierich A. Gaub M.P. LePennec J.P. Astinotti D. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2305-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).Human Gelatinase A Promoter Constructs—A set of 5′-deletion constructs of the human gelatinase A 5′-flanking region was prepared by PCR and directionally subcloned into the promoterless luciferase expression vector, pGL2-Basic (Promega), using the KpnI-BglII sites. These constructs were terminated at bp –1665, –1597, –1316, and –1076 relative to the major transcriptional start site and are denoted pT4-Luc1665, pT4-Luc1597, pT4-Luc1316, and pT4-Luc1076, respectively. To test the functional significance of the –1575G/A and –1059G/A polymorphisms, site-specific mutagenesis was performed on wild type genomic templates. These constructs were denominated pT4-Luc1597G1575C1306, pT4-Luc1597A1575C1306, pT4-Luc1076G1059, and pT4-Luc1076A1059. To test the interaction of the –1575G/A polymorphism with the –1306C/T polymorphism, construct pT4-Luc1597A1575C1306 was given the T allele of the –1306 polymorphism by site-specific mutagenesis. This construct was denominated pT4-Luc1597A1575T1306 and compared in transient transfection experiments with construct pT4-Luc1597G1575C1306 containing the wild type C in position –1306.A second set of luciferase reporter plasmids was constructed by subcloning three concatenated copies of bp –1586 to –1563 into the pGL2-Prom vector (Promega), which includes the heterologous SV40 promoter. The sequences of the forward oligonucleotides used for concatenation are shown with the variant in lowercase; –1575G: 5′-AAGACATAATCgTGACCTCCAATG-3′ and –1575A: 5′-AAGACATAATCaTGACCTCCAATG-3′. The constructs were denoted pT4-Luc1575G-P and pT4-Luc1575A-P, respectively. All constructs were sequenced to confirm authenticity.Transient Transfections—Transient transfections of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were performed with polyethyleneimine according to Boussif et al. (39Boussif O. Lezoualch F. Zanta M.A. Mergny M.D. Scherman D. Demeneix B. Behr J.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7297-7301Crossref PubMed Scopus (5569) Google Scholar). The respective pT4-Luc expression plasmids and a normalizing pCMV-β-galactosidase plasmid were used in concentrations of 2 μg/well. Total incubation time after transfection was 22 h. All experiments were carried out in quadruplicate and performed independently at least three times. Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays of cell lysates were performed as described (40Brasier A.R. Tate J.E. Habener J.F. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 1116-1122PubMed Google Scholar, 41Rosenthal N. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 704-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Results are expressed as the ratio of luciferase activity to β-galactosidase activity.For cotransfection experiments, 500 ng of the human estrogen receptor-α expression plasmid pSG5-HEO (which can be stimulated by estrogen to express the estrogen receptor-α) or control pSG5 plasmid (the kind gifts of Peter Kushner and Richard Price, University of California, San Francisco) were included in the transfection mixture. Additional cotransfections were performed with equivalent concentrations of the Sp1 expression plasmid, pSG5-Sp1. For these transfections phenol red-free medium and charcoal-treated fetal calf serum were used.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts from MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were prepared as reported previously (8Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Mertens P.R. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18786-18796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Synthetic oligonucleotides were annealed and end labeled with polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]dATP according to standard methodology. Nuclear extracts were used at 10 μg of protein/reaction in binding buffer with 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 1:2 μg of acetylated bovine serum albumin in a total volume of 20 μl. They were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C with the radiolabeled oligonucleotide. The samples were electrophoresed on 4% polyacrylamide and 15% glycerol gels in a buffer containing 1 × Tris borate/EDTA followed by autoradiography. For competition experiments, unlabeled oligonucleotides were added in 50-molar excess to the reaction mixture as described above and incubated for an additional 20 min at room temperature. Antibody depletion experiments were performed by preincubation of the nuclear extracts for 1 h at 4 °C with 1–2 μg/ml of mouse monoclonal anti-human estrogen receptor-α, rabbit polyclonal anti-human estrogen receptor-β, or control rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) prior to addition of labeled oligonucleotide and electrophoresis.Statistical Analysis—Statistical significances were determined for paired comparisons using Student's t test or by analysis of variance for multiple comparisons where appropriate. Statistical levels of significance for deviation from expected Hardy-Weinberg distributions were determined by χ2 analysis. The selection coefficient(s) and genetic fitness (w) were calculated using standard methodology.RESULTSIdentification and Characterization of SNPs within the 5′-Regulatory Region of the Human Gelatinase A Gene—Using discrete primer pairs encompassing 1665 bp of the 5′-regulatory region of the human gelatinase A gene, PCR was performed with genomic templates from 20 randomly chosen blood donors to assess the nature and extent of nucleotide variation within this region. After sequencing these fragments this study focused on PCR fragments A (spanning bp –1665 to –1317) and B (spanning bp –1316 to –967), each revealing a G → A transition at position –1575 and at position –1059 (Fig. 1). The –1059G/A polymorphism was used as a control for the population distribution studies because this site is not associated with any defined transcription factor binding site. Sequence analysis indicated that the presence of the –1575A allele introduced an RcaI restriction site into fragment A not present in the wild type allele –1575G. When the –1059A allele is present in fragment B, a unique HhaI restriction site is eliminated.When PCR fragment A was digested with RcaI, homozygotes with the wild type –1575G allele yielded one undigested 349-bp band on an agarose gel, whereas homozygotes with the –1575A allele yielded two bands, 260 bp and 89 bp in size. Heterozygotes yielded all three bands. Digests of fragment B with HhaI resulted in two bands, 260 bp and 90 bp in size for the wild type –1059G allele and in one undigested band of 350 bp for the –1059A allele (data not shown).A randomly chosen subset of 100 donors from the original pool was selected and sequenced through the –1575G/A polymorphism and the –1306C/T polymorphism reported by Price et al. (19Price S.J. Greaves D.R. Watkins H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7549-7558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), to determine whether potential linkage disequilibrium existed between the –1575 and –1306 sites. Only two patterns were detected: –1575G/–1306C and –1575A/–1306T, consistent with complete linkage disequilibrium between the two polymorphism sites.Survey of the transcription factor data base, Transfac (20Heinemeyer T. Wingender E. Reuter I. Hermjakob H. Kel A.E. Kel O.V. Ignatieva E.C. Ananko E.A. Podkolodnaya O.A. Kopakov F.A. Podkolodny N.L. Kolchanov N.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar), using the sequences surrounding the –1575G/A and –1059G/A alleles indicated that the –1575 bp site is located immediately 5′ to a half-palindromic binding site (TGACC) for the estrogen receptor (ERE). This observation prompted a functional analysis of the –1575 region to determine whether the polymorphism adjacent to the half-palindromic ERE affected gelatinase A transcription in response to estrogen.Allele-specific Binding of Nuclear Proteins to the –1575G/A Polymorphic Site—EMSAs were performed to investigate whether the half-palindromic site located between bp –1574 and –1570 was capable of specific interactions with the estrogen receptor and whether this interaction was modified by the –1575G/A transition. Two double-stranded oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the sequence from bp –1586 to –1563 in the gelatinase A promoter, with either G or A at the –1575 polymorphic site, were synthesized, labeled with [γ-32P]dATP, and incubated with nuclear extracts from the estrogen receptor-positive breast carcinoma cell line, MCF-7, or the estrogen receptor-negative breast carcinoma cell line, MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 2). In the presence of the MCF-7 nuclear extract, the radiolabeled 24-bp oligonucleotide containing the wild type G allele showed significant mobility retardation, with formation of a single major oligonucleotide-nuclear protein complex (Fig. 2, lane 2). The intensity of this complex was reduced significantly when MCF-7 nuclear extracts were incubated with the oligonucleotide containing the A allele (Fig. 2, lane 4). No nuclear protein-DNA binding was observed when the respective oligonucleotides were incubated with nuclear extracts from the estrogen receptor-negative MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 2, lanes 6 and 8).Fig. 2EMSA with radiolabeled 24-bp oligonucleotides containing either the –1575G or –1575A allele and nuclear extracts from estrogen receptor-positive MCF-7 cells or estrogen receptor-negative MDA-MB-231 cells. The mobilities of the labeled oligonucleotides without added nuclear extracts are shown in lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7. The arrow localizes a major oligonucleotide-nuclear protein complex in lane 2 using the –1575G allele, which is reduced significantly with the –1575A allele oligonucleotide. No oligonucleotide-nuclear protein complex was detected using extracts from MDA-MB-231 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The specificity of MCF-7 nuclear protein binding to the –1586/–1563 oligonucleotide was confirmed by competition experiments (Fig. 3). A 50-molar excess of cold –1575G oligonucleotide strongly competed for MCF-7 nuclear protein binding, resulting in the disappearance of the major shifted complex (Fig. 3, lane 3), whereas a 50-molar excess of cold –1575A oligonucleotide revealed only partial competition (Fig. 3, lane 4). No competition was observed when a cold oligonucleotide composed of the scrambled –1586/–1563 sequence was used (Fig. 3, lane 5), demonstrating the sequence specificity of MCF-7 nuclear protein binding.Fig. 3EMSA with the radiolabeled 24-bp oligonucleotide containing the –1575G allele and nuclear extracts from MCF-7 cells. Specificity of nuclear protein binding is demonstrated by cold competition with 50-molar excess of oligonucleotide with the –1575G allele (I.) versus the –1575A allele (II.) or a scrambled sequence (III.).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The formation of the oligonucleotide-nuclear protein complex was reduced significantly when the MCF-7 nuclear extracts were preincubated with a specific mouse monoclonal anti-human estrogen receptor-α antibody (Fig. 4, lane 3). Preincubation with a polyclonal rabbit anti-human estrogen receptor-β antibody (Fig. 4, lane 4) or control rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Fig. 4, lane 5) had no significant effect on the formation of the oligonucleotide-nuclear protein complex. These EMSA studies confirm a sequence-specific interaction of the human estrogen receptor-α protein present in MCF-7 nuclear extracts with the half-palindromic sequence. The absence of estrogen receptor-β protein binding to this site is consistent with the fact that MCF-7 cells do not express this form of the estrogen receptor. The competition experiments are consistent with estrogen receptor-α/half-palindromic sequence interactions, which have a binding affinity of at least 100-fold less for the estrogen receptor protein compared with a full palindromic sequence (21Kato S.

A search of the human genome for other potential SAFB family members revealed that KIAA00138 (now designated as SAFB2) has high homology to SAFB (now designated as SAFB1). SAFB1 and SAFB2 are mapped adjacent to each other on chromosome 19p13.3 and are arranged in a bidirectional divergent configuration (head to head), being separated by a short (<500 bp) GC-rich intergenic region that can function as a bidirectional promoter. SAFB1 and SAFB2 share common functions but also have unique properties. As shown previously for SAFB1, SAFB2 functions as an estrogen receptor corepressor, and its overexpression results in inhibition of proliferation. SAFB1 and SAFB2 interact directly through a C-terminal domain, resulting in additive repression activity. They are coexpressed in a number of tissues, but unlike SAFB1, which is exclusively nuclear, SAFB2 is found in the cytoplasm as well as the nucleus. Consistent with its cytoplasmic localization, we detected an interaction between SAFB2 and vinexin, a protein involved in linking signaling to the cytoskeleton. Our findings suggest that evolutionary duplication of the SAFB gene has allowed it to retain crucial functions, but also to gain novel functions in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus.

Fackelmayer F.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and as a protein binding to the small heat shock protein hsp27 gene promoter (2Oesterreich S. Lee A.V. Sullivan T.M. Samuel S.K. Davie J.R. Fuqua S.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 67: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). SAFB is a large protein (130 kDa) with a number of putative functional domains. The function of many of these domains is still unclear but can be inferred from the roles of similar domains in other proteins. The N terminus contains an SAF box (3Kipp M. Gohring F. Ostendorp T. van Drunen C.M. van Driel R. Przybylski M. Fackelmayer F.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7480-7489Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) (also called an SAP domain (4Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 112-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar)), which is a homeodomain-like DNA binding motif. This motif is believed to play a role in chromatin organization and specifically in organizing the interaction between nuclear matrix proteins and scaffold/matrix attachment regions. SAF boxes are found in proteins involved in very diverse processes such as transcription, RNA processing, apoptotic chromatin degradation, and DNA repair (3Kipp M. Gohring F. Ostendorp T. van Drunen C.M. van Driel R. Przybylski M. Fackelmayer F.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7480-7489Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Amino acids 409–484 harbor an RNA recognition motif (RRM), which is often found in mRNA-processing proteins. SAFB can interact with a number of proteins from the RNA-processing machinery, such as AUF1/hnRNP D, hnRNP A1, htra2-β1, ASF/SF2, SRp30c, and CLK2 (5Weighardt F. Cobianchi F. Cartegni L. Chiodi I.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3542-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, SAFB is able to alter the splice site selection of an E1A minigene (7Nayler O. Stratling W. Bourquin J.P. Stagljar I. Lindemann L. Jasper H. Hartmann A.M. Fackelmayer F.O. Ullrich A. Stamm S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3542-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Because SAFB was also shown to interact with the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, it has been suggested to be part of a “transcriptosome” complex, coupling transcription and RNA processing (7Nayler O. Stratling W. Bourquin J.P. Stagljar I. Lindemann L. Jasper H. Hartmann A.M. Fackelmayer F.O. Ullrich A. Stamm S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3542-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). SAFB has a nuclear localization signal (NLS), and using biochemical fractionation experiments, we and others have shown that SAFB is a nuclear protein that copurifies with chromatin (1Renz A. Fackelmayer F.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and nuclear matrix protein fractions (2Oesterreich S. Lee A.V. Sullivan T.M. Samuel S.K. Davie J.R. Fuqua S.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 67: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Previously we have published a number of studies showing that SAFB plays an important role in human breast cancer. First, it functions as an estrogen receptor (ER) corepressor (8Oesterreich S. Zhang Q. Hopp T. Fuqua S.A. Michaelis M. Zhao H.H. Davie J.R. Osborne C.K. Lee A.V. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). ER and SAFB interact both in vitro and in vivo, and overexpression of SAFB results in inhibition of ER activity. Second, overexpression of SAFB results in growth inhibition and generation of multinucleated cells. Finally, we discovered an exceptionally high rate of loss of heterozygosity (9Oesterreich S. Allredl D.C. Mohsin S.K. Zhang Q. Wong H. Lee A.V. Osborne C.K. O'Connell P. Br. J. Cancer. 2001; 84: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) at the SAFB chromosomal locus on 19p13 in human breast cancer (8Oesterreich S. Zhang Q. Hopp T. Fuqua S.A. Michaelis M. Zhao H.H. Davie J.R. Osborne C.K. Lee A.V. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Importantly, we have also identified SAFB mutations in those tumors but not in the adjacent normal tissue (9Oesterreich S. Allredl D.C. Mohsin S.K. Zhang Q. Wong H. Lee A.V. Osborne C.K. O'Connell P. Br. J. Cancer. 2001; 84: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Given that SAFB is a multifunctional gene that seems to play an important role in breast tumorigenesis, we set out to determine whether SAFB would also be part of a larger family. Searching GenBank we identified one gene that showed high homology to SAFB, termed KIAA0138. Herein we propose the nomenclature SAFB2 for KIAA0138 and SAFB1 for SAFB/HET/HAP. In this study we define similarities and differences in sequences and domain structures, chromosomal localizations, expression and subcellular localizations, and functions of SAFB1 and SAFB2. We believe that SAFB1 and SAFB2, like many other genes in the human genome, probably arose through duplication of a single ancestral gene. Plasmid Constructs and Chemicals—The cloning of the HET/SAF-B (SAFB1) expression construct (2Oesterreich S. Lee A.V. Sullivan T.M. Samuel S.K. Davie J.R. Fuqua S.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 67: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), of pEGFP-SAFB1 (11Townson S.M. Sullivan T. Zhang Q. Clark G.M. Osborne C.K. Lee A.V. Oesterreich S. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 3788-3796PubMed Google Scholar), and of the mammalian expression vector for full-length ER (12Castles C.G. Oesterreich S. Hansen R. Fuqua S.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 62: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) has been described previously. The human KIAA0138 cDNA (clone HA03743) (SAFB2) was kindly provided by the Kazusa DNA Research Institute (Kisarazu, Chiba, Japan). The 3,233-bp fragment with 57-bp poly(A) stretches was inserted into the EcoRV-NotI site of the Bluescript SK+ vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). To generate an expression vector, the cDNA was cut with the restriction enzymes KpnI and NotI and cloned into the KpnI and NotI sites of the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). pEGFP-SAFB2 was constructed by excising full-length SAFB2 from pcDNA3-SAFB2 with NotI, which was made blunt, and digested with KpnI. SAFB2 was then ligated into the KpnI and a blunt BamHI site of pEGFP-C1 (BD Biosciences). The putative SAFB1/2 promoter fragment was amplified by PCR using platinum Taq PFX (Invitrogen) from genomic DNA (MCF-7) with the following primers containing XhoI sites: forward 5′-GGA ACT GCA GGT CTT CGC CAC CGA CTC AGT CG-3′ and 5′-GGA ACT GCA GCC GCC CAC TTT CCA CAG AAG-3′. The fragment was cloned in both orientations into the XhoI site of the pGL3 Basic reporter plasmid (Promega) upstream of the luciferase gene. The clones were sequenced to verify both the orientation of the insert and sequence identity with the corresponding NCBI human genome sequences. All other constructs were verified using restriction digests and/or extension capillary sequencing (SeqWright, Houston, TX). All primers were purchased from MWG Biotech Inc. (High Point, NC), and PCRs were carried out using the MJ Research PT-200 Peltier Thermal Cycler (Waltham, MA). Chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless stated otherwise. Restriction and general molecular biology enzymes were purchased from Invitrogen. Cell Culture, Stable and Transient Transfection—Human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and T47D), a human osteosarcoma cell line (Saos-2 Endo), a human myeloblastoma cell line (KG-1), a transformed embryonic kidney cell line (293), and a monkey kidney cell line (CV-1) were maintained in improved modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 200 units/ml penicillin, 200 μg/ml streptomycin, and 6 ng/ml insulin. For reporter assays, cells were transiently transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's protocol. One day before transfection, cells were plated at 1.5 × 105 cells/well in six-well plates. For estradiol induction experiments, the cells were plated in serum-free medium, which consisted of phenol red-free improved modified Dulbecco's medium, 10 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 1 μg/ml fibronectin (Invitrogen), trace elements (Biofluids), and 1 μg/ml transferrin (Invitrogen). Cotransfections were performed using 1 μg of reporter plasmid (ERE-TK-LUC), 25 ng of β-galactosidase expression vector, and expression plasmids as indicated in the figure legends for each experiment. 24 h after transfection, the medium was replaced with serum-free medium containing the appropriate ligand. 48 h later cells were washed twice with PBS, and luciferase activity was measured using the luciferase kit from Promega (Madison, WI). β-Galactosidase activity was measured as described previously (2Oesterreich S. Lee A.V. Sullivan T.M. Samuel S.K. Davie J.R. Fuqua S.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 67: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and the luciferase activities were normalized by dividing by the β-galactosidase activity to give relative luciferase units. For FACS analysis, cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, washed, and fixed in 70% ethanol. Immediately before analysis on a FACS STAR PLUS (BD Biosciences), propidium iodide and RNase were added to final concentrations of 0.1 and 0.5 mg/ml, respectively. Data were analyzed using CellQuest software. To assay the activity of the putative SAFB1/2 promoter elements, 24 h before transfection, 1.5 × 105 MCF-7 cells were plated/well in a six-well plate in improved modified Dulbecco's medium. Cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 reagent with 1 μg of promoter or control vectors (empty pGL3 vector, TK-LUC) along with 25 ng of β-galactosidase control. Cells were harvested 36 h later, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activity were measured as described above. To generate doxycycline-inducible SAFB1-overexpressing cells, MCF-7 cells were transfected with pUHD172-1neo plasmid (13Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Mueller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar) encoding a fusion product of the VP16 activation domain of herpes simplex virus and a mutated Escherichia coli tetracycline repressor protein. Neomycin-resistant clones were tested for responsiveness to doxycycline, a tetracycline derivative, by transient transfection of a luciferase reporter gene. A parental clone (RTA-16) was subsequently transfected with HA-tagged SAFB1 subcloned into pTRE2-hygro plasmid (Clontech) downstream from the tetracycline resistance operator and a minimal cytomegalovirus promoter. Stable clones were selected in the presence of 200 μg of hygromycin and tested for inducible expression of HA-SAFB1 by immunoblotting using anti-HA and anti-SAFB antibodies. Reverse Transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and RNase Protection Assay— Total cellular RNA from cell lines was extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Human tissue RNA for RNase protection assay analysis was purchased from Clontech. Reverse transcription of the RNA was performed in a final volume of 20 μl using 2 μg of RNA and 25pmol of primer (5′-GTG GCC ATG GCG CTC ATC TCC-3′). The reaction mixture was incubated at 70 °C for 5min and then put immediately on ice. 4 μl of 5 × incubation buffer, 40 units of RNase inhibitor, 625 μm each dNTP, and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) were added, and the reaction was incubated at 42 °C for 1 h. Subsequent PCR was performed using SAFB2-specific primers (5′-CAA AGG GAG AGA GAG CGC CAG-3′, and 5′-GTG GCC ATG GCG GTC ATC TCC-3′) and 200 μm dNTPs, 1.5 mm MgSO4, 0.5 × enhancer solution, 10 × Pfx DNA polymerase buffer (Invitrogen), 1.25 units platinum Pfx DNA polymerase. The RNase protection assay was performed as described previously (11Townson S.M. Sullivan T. Zhang Q. Clark G.M. Osborne C.K. Lee A.V. Oesterreich S. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 3788-3796PubMed Google Scholar, 14Oesterreich S. Weng C.-N. Qiu M. Hilsenbeck S.G. Osborne C.K. Fuqua S.A.W. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4443-4448PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the SAFB1 (11Townson S.M. Sullivan T. Zhang Q. Clark G.M. Osborne C.K. Lee A.V. Oesterreich S. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 3788-3796PubMed Google Scholar) and 36B4 (15Laborda J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3998Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) probes, we also used an SAFB2-specific probe that was generated by cutting the SAFB2-pBSII SK+ with HindIII restriction enzyme. The released 700-bp fragment was cloned into pGEM-11zf (Promega), and the probe was made using T7 polymerase. Immunoblotting and Immunofluorescence—Proteins were resolved on 6% or 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membrane was blocked in PBS and 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) + 5% milk for 1 h at room temperature. Mouse monoclonal anti-SAFB (16Oesterreich S. Zhang Q.P. Lee A.V. Eur. J. Cancer. 2000; 36: S43-S44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Upstate Biotechnology), rabbit polyclonal anti-Gal4 DNA binding region (Upstate Biotechnology), mouse anti-GFP (BD Biosciences), polyclonal anti-vinexin (17Kioka N. Sakata S. Kawauchi T. Amachi T. Akiyama S.K. Okazaki K. Yaen C. Yamada K.M. Aota S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and mouse anti-HA (Covance, Princeton, NJ) were diluted at 1:1,000 in PBST + 5% milk. After washing six times for 5 min with PBST, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG at 1:1,000 (Amersham Biosciences) in PBST + 5% milk, washed six times for 5 min, and the signal was developed using enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). To produce SAFB2-specific antibodies, the SAFB2 peptide GLLDSFCDSKEYVAAQLRQ, corresponding to amino acids 154–172, was used to produce rabbit polyclonal anti-SAFB2 antiserum (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL), which was subsequently purified using immobilized peptide. This peptide is within a region of low homology between SAFB1 and SAFB2. For immunofluorescence, 5 × 104 cells (293, HeLa, MCF-7) were seeded onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips (Biocoat) (BD Biosciences) in 24-well plates 1 day before transfection. The cells were then transfected with GFP-vinexin β (17Kioka N. Sakata S. Kawauchi T. Amachi T. Akiyama S.K. Okazaki K. Yaen C. Yamada K.M. Aota S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) overnight. The next day the medium was changed to Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium + 10% fetal bovine serum, and cells were allowed to recover for 24 h. Cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed for 30 min in PEM (80 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2) and 4% paraformaldehyde, and then washed three times in PEM. The cells were permeabilized with PEM and 0.5% Triton X-100 buffer for 30 min, washed three times with PEM, and then blocked with PBST and 5% normal goat serum (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories Inc.). The cells were stained using our polyclonal anti-SAFB2 or the monoclonal anti-SAFB (Upstate Biotechnology) antibodies at 1:250 dilution in PBST and 5% normal goat serum overnight at 4 °C, and then washed five times for 5 min in PBST buffer. Cells were then stained with goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse Texas Red antibodies (Jackson) at 1:100 dilution in PBST and 5% normal goat serum followed by five washes for 5 min in PBST buffer. The coverslips were mounted on slides using mounting medium (Vectorshield, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Confocal microscopy was performed with a digital scanning confocal microscope (Nikon Eclipse E1000) equipped with a 60 ×/numerical aperture = 1.40/oil immersion objective. Images were exported to Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA), and final figures were composed in PowerPoint (Microsoft). In Vitro (GST Pull-down) and in Vivo (Coimmunoprecipitation) Protein-Protein Interaction—GST pull-down experiments were performed as described previously (8Oesterreich S. Zhang Q. Hopp T. Fuqua S.A. Michaelis M. Zhao H.H. Davie J.R. Osborne C.K. Lee A.V. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) using bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins and in vitro translated proteins. Coimmunoprecipitation studies were performed using transfected and nontransfected cell lines (i.e. coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins). For the transient transfections, 293 and CV-1 cells were plated at 5 × 106 cells in 10-cm dishes. The next day the cells were transiently transfected with the appropriate plasmids using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) for 7 h. The cells were maintained for an additional 20 h and then lysed in low stringency (PBS, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitors) or high stringency buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, protease inhibitors). 500 μg of lysate was precleared with 50 μl of protein G-agarose for 30 min at 4 °C and incubated overnight with 4 μg of the appropriate antibodies at 4 °C. Protein G-agarose was added for another 4 h, and the beads were pelleted and washed three times with low or high stringency buffer, respectively. Bound proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting. To detect interaction of endogenous proteins, MCF-7 cells were allowed to grow for 48 h in 20-cm dishes, washed with PBS, and proteins were cross-linked for 30 min with 1 mm DSP (Pierce) which is membrane-permeable. After subsequent washing of the cells, they were lysed in high stringency buffer, and immunoprecipitation was performed as described above. Yeast Two-hybrid Assays—We used the Matchmaker Two-Hybrid System 3 (BD Biosciences) with the yeast strain AH109, which includes three reporter genes, Ade2, His3, and α-galactosidase to reduce the incidence of false positive clones, for our yeast two-hybrid assays. Yeast manipulations were undertaken according the Clontech Matchmaker System 3 and Yeast Protocols Handbooks (BD Biosciences). The C-terminal SAFB1 domain (amino acids 599–915) was subcloned in-frame into the EcoRI-BamHI sites of pGBKT7. This SAFB1 clone results in expression of an SAFB1-C-Gal4DBD fusion protein of the expected size of 60 kDa (in vitro transcription and translation, TNT Kit, Promega) using the T7 promoter site of pGBKT7, as seen by Western blotting using polyclonal rabbit anti-Gal4 DNA binding region antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology) of the protein expressed in AH109 (data not shown). Similarly, the C terminus of SAFB2 (amino acids 600–953) was subcloned into pGADT7. SAFB1 bait and prey constructs were generated using appropriate PCR primers containing EcoRI or BamHI restriction sites and cloned into pGBKT7 and pGADT7 using the EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites of these vectors. The vinexin β yeast two-hybrid clone 3-1 was obtained from a yeast two-hybrid screen using the SAFB1 C-terminal domain as bait against a normal mammary gland library (Clontech). 2S. M. Townson, K. Kang, A. V. Lee, and S. Oesterreich, manuscript in preparation. For yeast two-hybrid interactions, the bait and prey constructs were cotransformed into the yeast strain AH109 and plated onto both SD-Leu/Trp and high stringency SD-Leu/Trp/His/Ade dropout plates. Colonies from the SD-Leu/Trp/His/Ade plates were allowed to grow for 5–10 days and then streaked onto new SD-Leu/Trp/His/Ade dropout plates. Interacting proteins were assessed after the colonies had been streaked a second time onto SD-Leu/Trp/His/Ade plates with or without X-α-galactose as the substrate for α-galactosidase. Appropriate controls as suggested by the manufacturer were used to ensure the validity of the interactions. Colonies that contained interacting proteins were maintained on SD-Leu/Trp/His/Ade and SD-Leu/Trp plates, whereas colonies having noninteracting proteins were maintained only on SD-Leu/Trp plates. SAFB1 and SAFB2 Are Highly Homologous Proteins That Map to the Same Chromosomal Locus—We set out to analyze whether SAFB is part of a gene family. Therefore, we performed a homology search using GenBank and identified a second human gene with very high homology to SAFB, termed KIAA0138 (accession number NM_014649). For ease of understanding and to prevent further confusion in the literature where a number of SAFB synonyms exist, we suggest the use of the terminology SAFB1 and SAFB2 for the two highly homologous genes; SAFB1 is the gene previously termed SAFB, HET, HET/SAFB, and HAP; and SAFB2 is the gene originally designated KIAAA0138. SAFB genes are highly conserved in other mammalian organisms. Orthologous SAFB1 and SAFB2 genes are present in mice; human SAFB1 corresponds to mouse gene ENSMUSG000000428128, and human SAFB2 corresponds to mouse gene ENSMUSG00000042625. A data base search of expressed sequence tag sequences also identified SAFB genes in cattle (Bos taurus, e.g. GenBank BE666390), and in pig (Sus scrofa, e.g. GenBank BI181164). Proteins with an SAF box and RRM domain structure similar to SAFBs have been identified in the sequence data bases of other organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster (gene CG6995, Berkeley Drosophila genome data base, (18Adams M.D. Celniker S.E.

Thierry-Mieg J. Spieth J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) at the Sanger Center revealed a putative gene CE43E11.1 (gene CE43E11.1 from clone C43E11, GenBank accession no. U80437) coding for the protein CE23592. Proteins with a domain structure similar to SAFB1 were not found in any of the public domain data bases for yeast, plants, bacteria, or protozoa. Further computer analysis of the translated protein sequences derived from the NCBI human genome sequence data base, expressed sequence tag data bases, and overlapping cDNAs indicated the presence of a third gene with high homology in its SAF box (also called SAP domain for SAF-A/B, Acinus, and PIAS) and RRM domains to both SAFB1 and SAFB2. The full-length open reading frame for this hypothetical protein can be deduced readily from the overlap of GenBank sequences AK000867 and NM_024755 (for hypothetical protein FLJ13213) to give a 1,034-amino acid protein. However, because the overall nucleotide homology of this hypothetical protein is only 36% to SAFB1 and 37% to SAFB2, suggesting that it is a more distantly related member of this gene family, we have limited our current studies to the characterization of SAFB1 and SAFB2. SAFB2 (KIAA0138 cDNA) was originally cloned from the myeloblast cell line KG-1 by Nagase et al. (20Nagase T. Seki N. Tanaka A. Ishikawa K. Nomura N. DNA Res. 1995; 2 (199–210): 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), but up until now no further analysis of this gene or its gene product has been reported. At the amino acid level, human SAFB2 shows a 74% homology to human SAFB1 (Fig. 1A) and 75% homology at the nucleotide level. The SAF box and RRM are highly conserved between SAFB1 and SAFB2 (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, there are three other regions that share high homology but whose function is unknown. One such region maps to the N terminus (amino acids 210–385), and the other two map to"

The present study suggests that the cleavage of 14-3-3 protein during apoptosis promotes cell death by releasing the associated Bad from the 14-3-3 protein and facilitates Bad translocation to the mitochondria and its interaction with Bcl-x(L). During the early events of apoptosis, mitochondria have been thought to act as central coordinators of cell death (1Green D.R. Reed J.C.

Some apoptotic signal cascades induce mitochondrial membrane permeabilization under the control of Bcl-2-related proteins in the mitochondria. The loss of transmembrane potential in the mitochondria then induces the release of apoptotic activators such as cytochrome c, Smac/DIABLO, HtrA2/Omi, AIF, Endo G, and caspases from the mitochondria (3Ravagnan L. Roumier T. Kroemer G. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 192: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Released cytochrome c activates caspase-9, binds to Apaf-1, and induces Apaf-1 oligomerization to form apoptosome (4Cain K. Bratton S.B. Langlais C. Walker G. Brown D.G. Sun X.M. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6067-6070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The apoptosome recruits and activates procaspase-9, which, in turn, activates inactive procaspase-3 into the active caspase-3, the executor molecule of apoptosis. Cytochrome c release was reported to be blocked by anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 or Bcl-x(L) and accelerated by pro-apoptotic Bax (5Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D.

Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4395) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 family proteins are key regulatory proteins that play critical roles in mediating the signal transduction path that leads to apoptosis. The multi-BH domain members of the Bcl-2 protein family either suppress (Bcl-2 or Bcl-x(L)) or promote (Bax or BAK) apoptosis, whereas “BH3-only members” (Bad or Bid) exclusively promote apoptosis (7Huang D.C.

Bad is a death-promoting BH3-only member of Bcl-2 family proteins and heterodimerizes with anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L). Survival kinases including Akt, protein kinase A (PKA), and ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (RSK1) phosphorylate serine residues of Bad (9Lizcano J.M. Morrice N. Cohen P. Biochem.

Bad phosphorylation has been shown to be necessary for the release of Bad from its association with Bcl-x(L). 14-3-3 proteins are conserved dimeric regulators in eukaryotic cells. There are seven isotypes of 14-3-3 proteins in mammals and two in yeast. 14-3-3 proteins are known for their ability to bind multiple cellular protein ligands. As many as 100 cellular proteins have been found to interact with 14-3-3 proteins to date. 14-3-3 proteins require phosphorylation of their target proteins for the interaction (13Yaffe M.B.

The large number and diversity of ligands for 14-3-3 proteins implicate a suggestion that 14-3-3 proteins are involved in many different cellular events, including signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, stress response, cytoskeleton organization, and malignant transformation (15van Hemert M.J. Steensma H.Y. van Heusden G.P. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 936-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that the function of 14-3-3 proteins still remains unknown, there exist some general themes about the anti-apoptotic function of 14-3-3 proteins. 14-3-3 proteins have been implicated in signaling for apoptosis through interaction with pro-apoptotic molecules such as Bad (11Yano S.

Phosphorylated Bad by survival kinases interacts with 14-3-3 proteins resulting in the retention of Bad in the cytoplasm and the subsequent prevention of cytotoxic interaction with Bcl-x(L) at the mitochondrial membrane. Caspases play important roles in the execution of apoptosis and inflammatory responses. A large set of cellular proteins has been surveyed for their ability to be cleaved by caspases, and various signaling proteins were found to be caspase substrates (21Miller D.K. Semin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 35-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 22Villa P. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 388-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified the 14-3-3ϵ protein as one of the caspase-3 substrates using a modified yeast two-hybrid genetic system. We explored the possibility that the cleavage of 14-3-3 proteins by caspase-3 during apoptosis might contribute to cell death by preventing the association of 14-3-3 proteins with Bad and facilitating Bad translocation to the mitochondria in which Bad associates with Bcl-x(L). Yeast Strains—The expression of the fusion protein was selected in the yeast EGY48 strain (Mat α, his3, trp1, ura3, LexAop-Leu2). The YM4271 strain (Mat a, ura3–52, his 3–200, lys2–801, ade2–101, ade 5, trp1–901, leu 2–3, 112, tyr1–501, gal4, gal80, ade5::hisG) was the mating partner for the EGY48 strain and was used to introduce plasmids expressing human caspases. Plasmids and cDNA Library—The B42 transcriptional activation domain of pJG4-5 (Clontech) was cloned into the XhoI and XbaI sites of pEG202 (Clontech) to generate pSub. Human PARP 1The abbreviations used are: PARP, poly(ADP)ribose polymerase; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; Ac-DEVD-CHO, acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde. and its mutant, PARPD214A, were cloned into the XhoI and PvuII sites of pSub to generate pSub-PARP and pSub-PARPD214A. The BALB/c mouse brain cDNA library was constructed using Universal RiboClone cDNA synthesis system (Promega) and was inserted into pSub to generate pSub-cDNAs (23Aguan K. Kusano T. Suzuki N. Kitagawa Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The B42 transcriptional activation domain of pJG4-5 was deleted to generate the caspase expression vector pExp. Human caspase-1 or 3 was cloned into the KpnI and XhoI sites of pExp for the expression in yeast YM4271 cells. Human Bad was cloned into a mammalian GST fusion vector, pEBG, to produce GST-fused Bad. Human 14-3-3ϵ and its mutants, D238 and D238A, were cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of cloning vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Hemagglutinin was inserted into the BamHI and HindIII sites of pcDNA3 to generate the N-terminal HA-tagged 14-3-3ϵ and its mutants. Yeast Transformation and Mating—Yeast EGY48 cells were transformed with p80lacZ (Clontech) bearing the LexA-responsive lacZ gene. EGY48 cells transformed with pSub-cDNA and YM4271 cells transformed with a human caspase expression vector pExp-C3 were mated on a single plate containing YPD-rich media (24Bendixen C. Gangloff S. Rothstein R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1778-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). After incubation for 6 h at 30 °C, the plate was replica-plated to the plates containing the selective media consisting of 40 mg/liter X-gal either with 2% dextrose or 2% galactose plus 1% raffinose. Caspase Activity Assay—The activities of caspase-1 or 3 were measured using a fluorogenic peptide substrate, zVAD-AMC (Bachem) as described (25Vanags D.M. Porn-Ares M.I. Coppola S. Burgess D.H. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31075-31085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Yeast YM4271 cells transformed with human caspase expression vector encoding caspase-1 or 3 were cultured in the media containing 1% raffinose for 12 h. The expression of caspases was induced by the addition of 2% galactose to the media. After incubation for 6 h, cell pellets were placed in liquid nitrogen and lysed using glass beads (Sigma) in a disruption buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and protease inhibitor mix (1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysate proteins (25 μg) were incubated with 50 μm zVAD-AMC in a standard interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (ICE) reaction buffer (25Vanags D.M. Porn-Ares M.I. Coppola S. Burgess D.H. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31075-31085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Cleavage of zVAD-AMC was monitored by a fluorescence spectrophotometer at an excitation/emission wavelength pair of 355 nm/460 nm. In Vitro Cleavage of 14-3-3ϵ Protein by Caspase-3—Human 14-3-3ϵ and its mutant, D238A, were cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the procedures of QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). 35S-labeled 14-3-3ϵ protein and D238A were produced using the tnt T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). In vitro translated 35S-14-3-3ϵ protein or 35S-D238A was incubated with Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cell lysate containing the recombinant human caspase-3 at 30 °C for 8 h. Proteolytic cleavage of 35S-labeled 14-3-3ϵ protein and D238A was analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Immunoblotting and Co-immunoprecipitation—COS cells were harvested 10 h after staurosporine treatment or 24 h after UVC irradiation. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer A containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaF, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cellular 14-3-3ϵ protein was resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, and cleavage of the 14-3-3ϵ protein and PARP was analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies directed against the 14-3-3ϵ protein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and PARP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Effects of 14-3-3ϵ protein cleavage on Bad association with cellular Bcl-x(L) were examined in human 293T cells. Cells were co-transfected with GST-Bad and constructs of HA-14-3-3ϵ by the calcium phosphate method as described (26Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 16.19-16.20Google Scholar). After incubation for 24 h, cells were lysed in lysis buffer A. Bad and its associated proteins were then “pulled down” using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). HA-14-3-3ϵ protein and Bcl-x(L), which were associated with Bad, were analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies directed against HA and Bcl-x(L) (Transduction Laboratories), respectively. Apoptosis—Apoptosis was measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection and fixed with cold ethanol. DNA contents were determined by FACS after propidium iodide staining. DNA contents of cells at sub-G0/G1 were used as the index for the degree of apoptosis. Identification of 14-3-3ϵ Protein as Caspase Substrate by the Modified Yeast Two-hybrid System—Fig. 1A illustrates the strategy for identifying caspase substrates in the yeast genetic system. The cDNAs encoding caspase substrates were fused between the LexA DNA-binding domain and the B42 activation domain. Yeast EGY48 cells expressing the fusion products produced the blue β-galactosidase positive colonies under the LexA operator on plates containing the indicator X-gal. The transformants failed to express lacZ and grew as white β-galactosidase negative colonies when plasmids harboring the cDNA that encodes caspases were introduced by mating, and the fusion products were cleaved by caspases. In Fig. 1B, a known caspase-3 substrate, poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase, was examined for its ability to be cleaved by caspase-3 in the modified yeast two-hybrid system. Yeast cells expressing the fusion product containing PARP transcribed lacZ under the LexA operator and grew as white β-galactosidase negative colonies after the introduction of caspase-3 by mating. However, cells expressing the fusion product containing caspase-resistant PARP (PARPD214A) in which Asp214 at the P1 position was substituted with Ala (27Kim J.W. Won J. Sohn S. Joe C.O. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 955-961PubMed Google Scholar) remained β-galactosidase positive, although caspase-3 was introduced by mating. These results suggest the feasibility of the modified yeast two-hybrid system as a genetic system for identifying caspase substrates. Both caspase-1 and 3 were active in yeast YM4271 cells, and their activities were inhibited by the specific caspase inhibitors, supporting the idea that yeast can be used as a cell-based reporter system for caspase activity (Fig. 1C). Screening the mouse brain cDNA fusion library (∼108 colony-forming units/ml) resulted in the isolation of 16 clones. 14-3-3ϵ (amino acid residues 144–255) was chosen as one of the caspase-3 substrates isolated by the modified yeast genetic system. 35S-labeled 14-3-3ϵ protein was prepared by in vitro transcription/translation procedures and partially cleaved by the recombinant human caspase-3, while PARP was completely cleaved under the same condition. The cleavage was completely inhibited by a specific caspase-3 inhibitor, Ac-DEVD-CHO (Fig. 2A). The cleavage of the 14-3-3ϵ protein in COS cells in response to apoptosis inducers was examined in Fig. 2B. Data revealed that apoptosis inducers such as UVC or staurosporine induced the cleavage of the endogenous 14-3-3ϵ protein in COS cells. The concomitant cleavage of PARP implicates the activation of caspase-3 in COS cells after UVC irradiation or staurosporine treatment. Indeed, the activities of caspase-3 were elevated in parallel with the cleavage of cellular 14-3-3ϵ in COS cells after UVC irradiation (data not shown). Amino acid sequence analysis of the cleavage product revealed that caspase-3 cleaves the 14-3-3ϵ protein at Asp238 of MQGD. A mutant 14-3-3ϵ protein in which Asp238 was substituted with Ala (D238A) was not cleavable by caspase-3 (Fig. 2C).Fig. 2Cleavage of 14-3-3ϵ protein at Asp238 by caspase-3.A, the 35S-labeled 14-3-3ϵ protein and PARP were produced by in vitro transcription/translation procedures. 35S-labeled 14-3-3ϵ protein or 35S-labeled PARP was cleaved by the recombinant human caspase-3, and the cleavages were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE and subsequent autoradiography. Ac-DEVD-CHO was used as a specific caspase-3 inhibitor. B, COS cells (107 cells) were treated with staurosporine or UVC and incubated for 10 h or 24 h respectively. Cell lysate proteins (50 μg) were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE. Cleavages of the cellular 14-3-3ϵ protein and PARP were examined by immunoblot analysis using antibodies against the 14-3-3ϵ protein and PARP, respectively. C, the 35S-labeled 14-3-3ϵ protein and the uncleavable D238A were produced by in vitro transcription/translation procedures. The cleavage of the 35S-labeled proteins by the recombinant human caspase-3 was analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE and subsequent autoradiography. Ac-DEVD-CHO was used as a specific caspase-3 inhibitor.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cleavage of 14-3-3ϵ Protein Impairs Its Binding Ability with Bad and Facilitates Bad-mediated Apoptosis—Bad and 14-3-3ϵ constructs were over-expressed in cultured 293T cells. The cleaved 14-3-3ϵ protein fragment, D238, interacted with Bad with lower affinity than its wild type or the uncleavable counterpart, D238A. Bad interacted with the endogenous Bcl-x(L) in cells co-expressing Bad either with the wild type 14-3-3ϵ protein or the uncleavable D238A. Interestingly, co-expression of the truncated 14-3-3ϵ protein D238 with Bad significantly increased Bad association with cellular Bcl-x(L) (Fig. 3), and the increased Bad association with Bcl-x(L) appeared to contribute to Bad-mediated apoptosis. Bad-mediated apoptosis was not affected by the ectopic expression of the wild type 14-3-3ϵ protein of the uncleavable D238A (Fig. 4A). The expression of the truncated D238 also enhanced staurosporine-induced apoptosis, whereas the expression of the uncleavable D238A did not increase apoptosis in 293T cells after staurosporine treatment (data not shown). Cleavage of the 14-3-3ϵ protein by caspase-3 did not seem to change the pattern of 14-3-3ϵ protein dimerization (Fig. 4B). GST-tagged wild type 14-3-3ϵ protein (GST-14-3-3ϵ) was co-expressed with HA-tagged wild type 14-3-3ϵ protein (HA-14-3-3ϵ), the truncated D238 (HA-D238), or uncleavable D238A (HA-D238A) in 293T cells. HA-14-3-3ϵ derivatives bound to GST-14-3-3ϵ proteins were examined by immunoblot analysis. HA-D238 dimerized equally well with the GST-14-3-3ϵ protein as HA-14-3-3ϵ or HA-D238A dimerized with GST-14-3-3ϵ.Fig. 4Co-expression of the cleaved 14-3-3ϵ protein enhanced Bad-mediated apoptosis.A, Bad and the 14-3-3ϵ protein were co-expressed in 293T cells. After transfection for 24 h, cells were harvested and fixed with cold ethanol. Cells were stained with propidium iodide (PI) for 4 h after fixation. The percentage of apoptosis was quantified by DNA contents of cells at sub G0/G1 using FACS. Data represent the mean value obtained from the five independent experiments (mean ± S.E.) B, GST-14-3-3ϵ was co-expressed with each HA-14-3-3ϵ derivative in 293T cells. GST-14-3-3ϵ and its associated proteins were analyzed by immunoblot analysis as described in Fig. 3.

Science. 1999; 284: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). These studies proposed that the cleavage of the 14-3-3ϵ protein by the activated caspsae-3 contributes to apoptosis by releasing Bad from its association with the 14-3-3 protein and facilitates Bad translocation from the cytosol to the mitochondria and its interaction with Bcl-x(L). Cleavage of the 14-3-3ϵ protein appeared to impair the ability of its binding with Bad (Fig. 3). 14-3-3 proteins mediate signal transduction through their binding with the target proteins containing phosphoserine residues. Two different binding motifs, Arg-Ser-Xaa-Ser(P)-Xaa-Pro and Arg-Xaa-Tyr/Phe-Xaa-Ser(P)-Xaa-Pro (where Ser(P) represents phosphoserine and Xaa is any amino acid residue) have been identified in nearly all known 14-3-3 binding proteins. Cell death promoting Bad contains two 14-3-3 binding sites with sequences of Arg-Ser-His-Ser(P)-Tyr-Pro and Arg-Ser-Arg-Ser(P)-Ala-Pro and associates with the 14-3-3 protein dimer very tightly but at very slow rate (13Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C.

Data in Fig. 3 indicate that Bad freed from 14-3-3 translocates to the mitochondria and heterodimerizes with Bcl-x(L). This hypothesis was supported by the works of Zha et al. (30Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2246) Google Scholar) who showed that the 14-3-3 protein sequesters phosphorylated Bad and prevents Bad from heterodimerizing with Bcl-x(L). The highly conserved 14-3-3 proteins have been known to be present as multiple isotypes in many eukaryotic organisms (31Aitken A. Collinge D.B. van Heusden B.P. Isobe T. Roseboom P.H. Rosenfeld G. Soll J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 498-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 32Morrison D. Science. 1994; 266: 56-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The primary function of mammalian 14-3-3 protein isotypes is to inhibit apoptosis. 14-3-3 proteins have been thought to inhibit the pro-apoptotic function of their binding proteins, of which Bad is a typical example (17Kennedy S.G. Kandel E.S. Cross T.K. Hay N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5800-5810Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Recently, Xing et al. (33Xing H. Zhang S. Weinheimer C. Kovacs A. Muslin A.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) depicted 14-3-3 proteins as general anti-apoptotic factors. They reported that the dominant negative mutant forms of the 14-3-3 protein disrupted the anti-apoptotic function of the wild type 14-3-3 protein and increased apoptosis in response to UV irradiation. In the present study, we suggest that the 14-3-3ϵ protein is cleaved by the activated caspase-3 to promote cell death during exposure to apoptotic signals. The cleaved 14-3-3ϵ protein impaired its binding affinity to Bad and released Bad to translocate to the mitochondrial outer membrane where Bad heterodimerizes with Bcl-x(L). 14-3-3 proteins have been shown to inhibit Bad-induced apoptosis through interaction at the phosphorylation sites of Bad (11Yano S. Tokumitsu H. Soderling T.R. Nature. 1998; 396: 584-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 16Wang H.G. Pathan N. Ethell I.M. Krajewski S. Yamaguchi Y. Shibasaki F. McKeon F. Bobo T. Franke T.F. Reed J.C. Science. 1999; 284: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). A number of studies have described the dimeric array of 14-3-3 proteins that interacts with 14-3-3 binding proteins at two 14-3-3 consensus binding motifs. The dominant-positive lethal effect of the truncated 14-3-3ϵ protein (D238) on Bad-induced apoptosis in 293T cells (Fig. 4A) cannot be explained by the failure of the intermolecular association of D238 with Bad (Fig. 3), because the endogenous cellular 14-3-3ϵ protein in 293T cells expressing D238 should also have interacted with Bad. The results in Fig. 4B offered an explanation that the truncated D238 heterodimerized with the endogenous 14-3-3ϵ protein and lowered the intracellular level of self-associated wild type 14-3-3ϵ dimers that could sequester Bad in co-transfected cells. 14-3-3 proteins may form heterodimers as well as homodimers; therefore the truncated D238 may also dimerize with isoforms of 14-3-3 proteins in 293T cells. It is unlikely that cleavage of the 14-3-3ϵ protein by caspase-3 changes the pattern of dimerization during Bad-induced apoptosis, because the residues of 14-3-3 isoforms involved in the dimer formation are largely conserved among mammalian isoforms (34Jones D.H. Ley S. Aitken A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The fact that D238 forms heterodimers with isoforms of 14-3-3 proteins may not affect the interaction of D238 with Bad, because the different isoforms of the 14-3-3 protein were reported to interact equally well with Bad (14Rittinger K. Budman J. Xu J. Volinia S. Cantley L.C. Smerdon S.J. Gamblin S.J. Yaffe M.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 153-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The binding ability of HA-D238 with Bad was compared with that of HA-14-3-3ϵ or the uncleavable HA-D238A in an experiment in which HA-14-3-3ϵ or HA-D238A were co-expressed with or without wild type 14-3-3ϵ protein in 293T cells. Over-expression of the 14-3-3ϵ protein did not interfere with the binding affinity of HA-D238 with Bad, suggesting that cleavage of the 14-3-3ϵ protein by casapse-3 lowers its binding affinity with Bad regardless of the state of the intermolecular association of the cleaved 14-3-3ϵ protein (data not shown). The released death promoting Bad then heterodimerizes with Bcl-x(L) located in the outer membrane of the mitochondria. The binding of Bad to Bcl-x(L) might cause Bcl-x(L) to interact with pro-apoptotic Bax to release cytochrome c or regulate other Bcl-x(L) activities (3Ravagnan L. Roumier T. Kroemer G. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 192: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), leading to the progression of cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2027005520,"In mammals, methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT), the enzyme responsible for S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) synthesis, is encoded by two genes, MAT1A and MAT2A. In liver, MAT1A expression is associated with high AdoMet levels and a differentiated phenotype, whereas MAT2A expression is associated with lower AdoMet levels and a dedifferentiated phenotype. In the current study, we examined regulation of MAT2A gene expression by l-methionine availability using HepG2 cells. In l-methionine-deficient cells, MAT2A gene expression is rapidly induced, and methionine adenosyltransferase activity is increased. Restoration of l-methionine rapidly down-regulates MAT2A mRNA levels; for this effect, l-methionine needs to be converted into AdoMet. This novel action of AdoMet is not mediated through a methyl transfer reaction. MAT2A gene expression was also regulated by 5′-methylthioadenosine, but this was dependent on 5′-methylthioadenosine conversion to methionine through the salvage pathway. The transcription rate of the MAT2A gene remained unchanged during l-methionine starvation; however, its mRNA half-life was significantly increased (from 100 min to more than 3 h). The effect of l-methionine withdrawal on MAT2A mRNA stabilization requires both gene transcription and protein synthesis. We conclude that MAT2A gene expression is modulated as an adaptive response of the cell to l-methionine availability through its conversion to AdoMet. In mammals, methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT), the enzyme responsible for S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) synthesis, is encoded by two genes, MAT1A and MAT2A.

We conclude that MAT2A gene expression is modulated as an adaptive response of the cell to l-methionine availability through its conversion to AdoMet. Regulation of cellular functions by nutrients, including the control of gene expression, is well documented in prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes. In mammals, these responses have also been observed, and lipids and carbohydrates, among other dietary constituents, have been shown to be important regulators of gene expression (1Pégorier J.P. Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab. Care. 1998; 1: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 2Vaulont S. Kahn A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 3Foufelle F. Girard J. Ferre P. Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab. Care. 1998; 1: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Mammalian cells can also adapt to dietary or pathological fluctuations in amino acid availability (4Kilberg M.S. Hutson R.G. Laine R.O. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 5Fafournoux P. Bruhat A. Jousse C. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Amino acid limitation elicits a series of cellular responses, among which the up-regulation of amino acid transport systems was one of the first to be recognized (reviewed in Refs. 6Kilberg M.S. Stevens B.R. Novak D.A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1993; 13: 137-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar and 7Palacin M. Estevez B.J. Zorzano A. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 969-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Subsequently, a number of genes have been shown to specifically change their expression levels following amino acid deprivation, although the underlying mechanisms are not completely known (4Kilberg M.S. Hutson R.G. Laine R.O. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 5Fafournoux P. Bruhat A. Jousse C. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Under such limiting conditions, amino acids play a signaling role in the cell, conveying regulatory messages to the transcriptional machinery and affecting the turnover of specific mRNAs and proteins (5Fafournoux P. Bruhat A. Jousse C. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 8Kilberg M.S. Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 1801-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These processes are beginning to be understood with work carried out mainly in cultured cells, given the complexity of the response to amino acid deprivation in intact animals, which includes nutrient-induced changes in hormone levels. l-Methionine is an essential amino acid required for protein synthesis and participates, together with ATP, in the formation of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), 1The abbreviations used are: AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; ActD, actinomycin D; AdoHcy, S-adenosylhomocysteine; C3-Ado, 3-deazaadenosine; C3-AdoHcy, S-3-deaza-adenosylhomocysteine; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; KRB, Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate; MAT, methionine adenosyltransferase; MEM, minimum Eagle's medium; MTA, 5′-methylthioadenosine; MTAP, 5′-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase. the principal biological methyl donor (9Cantoni G.L.

Avila M.A. Corrales F.J. Homocysteine in Health and Disease. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK2001: 47-62Google Scholar). Upon transfer of its activated methyl group to many different acceptor molecules, AdoMet is converted into S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy), a molecule that can be further hydrolyzed to adenosine and homocysteine in a reversible reaction (10Finkelstein J.D. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1990; 1: 228-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). Homocysteine in turn may be converted into cystathionine or remethylated back to l-methionine, depending on the cellular needs for this amino acid (10Finkelstein J.D. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1990; 1: 228-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). Mammalian cells have developed a series of adaptive mechanisms that respond to fluctuations in l-methionine availability, which have been best characterized in the liver and involve the modulation of enzymatic activities implicated in methionine metabolism (10Finkelstein J.D. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1990; 1: 228-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar, 12Finkelstein J.D. Martin J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1582-1587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some of these mechanisms, including the capacity to remethylate homocysteine, are impaired in the transformed cell, giving rise to the condition of “methionine dependence” in cancer (reviewed in Ref. 13Hoffman R.M. Anticancer Res. 1985; 5: 1-30PubMed Google Scholar). The first step in l-methionine metabolism, the synthesis of AdoMet, is catalyzed by the enzyme methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT). In mammals, there are three isoenzymes for MAT (MAT I, MAT II, and MAT III); MAT I and MAT III are two oligomeric forms (a tetramer and dimer, respectively) of the protein coded by MAT1A gene, whereas MAT II is the product of the MAT2A gene (11Mato J.M. Avila M.A. Corrales F.J. Homocysteine in Health and Disease. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK2001: 47-62Google Scholar, 14Mato J.M. Alvarez L. Ortiz P. Pajares M.A. Pharmacol.

Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 51-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The expression of both genes is differentially regulated; MAT1A is expressed in the adult hepatocyte, whereas MAT2A is expressed in all other cells of the organism and in the fetal hepatocyte (11Mato J.M. Avila M.A. Corrales F.J. Homocysteine in Health and Disease. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK2001: 47-62Google Scholar, 14Mato J.M. Alvarez L. Ortiz P. Pajares M.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 73: 265-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Interestingly, MAT2A expression is induced when the adult hepatocyte proliferates (as occurs during liver regeneration) and upon neoplastic transformation of the liver, where MAT1A expression is silenced (11Mato J.M.

Although both enzymes catalyze the same reaction, they display distinct catalytic and regulatory properties that impact on the intracellular concentrations of AdoMet (11Mato J.M. Avila M.A. Corrales F.J. Homocysteine in Health and Disease. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK2001: 47-62Google Scholar). We have recently shown that in liver, AdoMet plays a pivotal role in the regulation of essential cellular functions, such as the control of cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (18Latasa M.U.

In the present work, we describe how expression of the MAT2A gene is acutely regulated by the availability of l-methionine and investigate the mechanisms behind this response. Our observations indicate that fluctuations in l-methionine availability regulate MAT2A expression mainly at the level of mRNA turnover; additionally, we demonstrate an essential role for AdoMet in this response, further supporting the hypothesis of AdoMet as a signaling molecule in the liver (25García-Trevijano E.R.

Chemicals—AdoMet, in the stable form of sulfate-p-toluenesulfonate salt produced by Knoll (Milan, Italy) was from Europharma (Madrid, Spain). 5′-Methylthioadenosine (MTA) was generously provided by Knoll (Milan, Italy). All other reagents were of analytical grade, and unless otherwise stated, they were purchased form Sigma. Cell Culture and Treatment Conditions—Human HepG2 hepatoma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA), and HuH7 human hepatoma cells were from our tissue culture facility at the University of Navarra. Cells were maintained in minimum Eagle's medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humid atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. To test MAT2A expression, cells were cultured in l-methionine-deficient MEM supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and varying concentrations of l-methionine (Sigma). It has been estimated that l-methionine concentration in bovine serum is around 15 μm, so the final concentration of l-methionine in our experiments would be around 0.75 μm; in this work, this is referred to as l-methionine restriction. In some experiments, cells were kept in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (KRB) and varying concentrations of l-methionine. No significant differences in cell viability, as determined by trypan blue exclusion test, were observed under the different treatments. Determination of MAT Activity and AdoMet Levels—Cells (3 × 106) were lysed by freeze thawing in 300 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.3 mm sucrose, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm benzamidine, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenate was centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 × g, and MAT activity was assayed in the supernatant as described previously (27Avila M.A. Carretero M.V. Rodriguez E.N. Mato J.M. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 364-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For the determination of AdoMet concentrations, cells were lysed and deproteinized in 0.4 m perchloric acid and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were filtered and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography as described previously (27Avila M.A. Carretero M.V. Rodriguez E.N. Mato J.M. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 364-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated by the guanidinium thiocyanate method as described (28Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal.

RNA concentration was determined spectrophotometrically before use, and the integrity was checked by electrophoresis with subsequent ethidium bromide staining. Electrophoresis of RNA and gel blotting were carried out as described (27Avila M.A. Carretero M.V. Rodriguez E.N. Mato J.M. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 364-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 29Avila M.A. Velasco J.A. Cho C. Lupu R. Wen D. Notario V. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 963-971PubMed Google Scholar). Northern hybridization analysis was performed on total RNA using standard procedures as described (27Avila M.A. Carretero M.V. Rodriguez E.N. Mato J.M. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 364-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 29Avila M.A. Velasco J.A. Cho C. Lupu R. Wen D. Notario V. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 963-971PubMed Google Scholar). All probes (human MAT2A and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNAs) were labeled with [32P]dCTP using a random primer kit (RediPrime DNA Labeling System; Amersham Bisociences). To ensure equal loading of RNA samples, membranes were also hybridized with 32P-labeled 18 S rRNA DNA probe. Quantitation was performed by scanning densitometry of the x-ray films, using the Molecular Analyst software (Bio-Rad), and values were normalized to 18 S rRNA. Nuclear Run-on Transcription Assay—Nuclei from 3 × 107 HepG2 cells kept in MEM without l-methionine for different durations were isolated as described previously (27Avila M.A. Carretero M.V. Rodriguez E.N. Mato J.M. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 364-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Transcription reactions were performed for 30 min at 37 °C with 60 μl of the isolated nuclei in a final volume of 200 μl in the presence of 100 μCi of [α-32P]uridine triphosphate (800 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) and 0.5 mm unlabeled nucleotides essentially as described (27Avila M.A. Carretero M.V. Rodriguez E.N. Mato J.M. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 364-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Elongated RNA transcripts were purified by phenol extraction as described above, denatured, and hybridized (at equivalent amounts of radioactivity (i.e. 1–2 × 106 cpm)) to 5 μg of the corresponding cDNAs and immobilized on Nytran filters in hybridization buffer (0.2 m NaPO4 (pH 7.2), 1 mm EDTA, 7% SDS, 45% formamide, and 250 mg/ml Escherichia coli transfer RNA as carrier) for 48 h at 42 °C. The DNAs used were the human MAT2A, GAPDH, MTAP, S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, and 18 S cDNAs; pUC18 was used for background control. The filters were washed and exposed to x-ray films. Quantitation was performed by scanning densitometry of the x-ray films, using the Molecular Analyst software (Bio-Rad). Data were normalized to the transcription of the GAPDH gene, the steady-state mRNA levels of which were not affected by short term l-methionine depletion. Statistics—Unless otherwise stated, the data are means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments performed in duplicate. Statistical significance was estimated with Student's t test. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. l-Methionine Restriction Induces MAT2A mRNA Levels and MAT Activity in HepG2 Cells—To evaluate the effect of l-methionine levels on MAT2A gene expression, HepG2 cells were cultured for different periods of time in l-methionine-deficient MEM with 5% fetal calf serum, and MAT2A expression was assessed by Northern blotting. As shown in Fig. 1A, MAT2A mRNA levels were dramatically induced by l-methionine restriction in HepG2 cells in a time-dependent fashion. The intracellular levels of AdoMet in HepG2 cells before l-methionine restriction (t = 0) were 1.2 ± 0.10 nmol/mg of protein and were reduced to 0.28 ± 0.02 nmol/mg of protein after 4 h of incubation in l-methionine-deficient medium. The magnitude of MAT2A mRNA accumulation was also dependent on the levels of l-methionine in the culture medium, as observed when HepG2 cells were cultured for 24 h in MEM supplemented with increasing concentrations of this amino acid (Fig. 1B). The intracellular levels of AdoMet in cells cultured during 24 h in MEM supplemented with 0, 100, or 1000 μm l-methionine were 0.16 ± 0.02, 1.04 ± 0.06, and 1.52 ± 0.01 nmol/mg of protein, respectively. The levels of GAPDH mRNA and 18 S ribosomal RNA were also measured, and no significant changes were observed (Fig. 1, A and B). The induction of MAT2A gene expression correlated with the up-regulation of MAT II activity when measured 24 h after culture in l-methionine-restricted MEM (Fig. 1C). The same observations were made in HuH7 cells (data not shown). Specificity of MAT2A Response to l-Methionine Depletion—To determine whether the observed up-regulation of MAT2A mRNA levels was limited to l-methionine restriction in culture medium, HepG2 cells were grown in complete MEM (100 μm l-methionine) until 70% confluence and subsequently cultured in KRB buffer for 2 h in the presence of 0 or 100 μm l-methionine. As shown in Fig. 2A, MAT2A gene expression was induced in methionine-deficient KRB medium, whereas the addition of l-methionine prevented this response. The expression of other genes related to AdoMet metabolic pathways, such as S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase and 5′-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase, was also tested in HepG2 cells under the above mentioned conditions, and no significant changes were observed (Fig. 2A). We next examined the mechanisms through which l-methionine could mediate this acute effect on MAT2A gene expression. As previously stated, besides its involvement in protein synthesis, intracellular l-methionine is metabolized into AdoMet by the action of MAT (Fig. 3 summarizes AdoMet metabolic pathways). We tested whether AdoMet could mimic the effect of l-methionine on MAT2A gene expression. For this purpose, HepG2 cells were cultured in methionine-restricted MEM for 24 h in the presence of 4 mm AdoMet, and MAT2A mRNA levels were subsequently analyzed by Northern blotting. Intracellular AdoMet concentrations were measured in control and AdoMet-treated cells 8 h after the addition of this compound. These concentrations were 0.20 ± 0.01 and 5.02 ± 0.2 nmol/mg of protein in control and AdoMet-treated cells, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2B, the potent induction of MAT2A gene expression that occurs in the absence of l-methionine (lane 2) was not observed to such an extent when AdoMet was added to the culture medium (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 2 and 3). However, under the same conditions, the nonmetabolizable d-isomer of methionine (at 100 μm) had no effect on MAT2A gene expression (Fig. 2B, lane 4). Interestingly, MTA (at 500 μm), a product of AdoMet metabolism generated in the polyamine biosynthetic pathway and the first molecule in the methionine salvage route (30Tabor H. Tabor C W. Pharmacol. Rev. 1964; 16: 245-300PubMed Google Scholar, 31Williams-Ashman H.G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1982; 31: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 32Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 759-774PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3), was very effective in preventing the induction of MAT2A mRNA levels by methionine restriction (Fig. 2B, lane 5). In liver cells, homocysteine can be remethylated and converted back to methionine through two alternative pathways that involve the enzyme methionine synthase or the enzyme betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (10Finkelstein J.D. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1990; 1: 228-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar, 11Mato J.M. Avila M.A. Corrales F.J. Homocysteine in Health and Disease. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK2001: 47-62Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). Methionine synthase is a cobalamin-dependent enzyme that requires 5-methyltetrahydrofolate to convert homocysteine into methionine (33Olteanu H. Banerjee R. Homocysteine in Health and Disease. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK2001: 135-144Google Scholar). We incubated HepG2 cells with homocysteine (200 μm), folinic acid (100 μm, a precursor of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate), and cyanocobalamin (15 μm) for 24 h in the absence of l-methionine. As shown in Fig. 2B, lane 6, this treatment had no effect on MAT2A mRNA levels that were strongly induced after 24 h in a methionine-deficient medium. Similarly, we explored the pathway catalyzed by betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase for the conversion of homocysteine into methionine by incubating cells with betaine (2 mm) and homocysteine (200 μm) for 24 h in the absence of the l-methionine addition. This treatment was also unable to modulate the induction of MAT2A mRNA in response to l-methionine restriction (Fig. 2B, lane 7). The induction of MAT2A mRNA elicited by methionine restriction could be due either to an increase in transcription of the gene or to increased mRNA stability. Consequently, we have measured the effect of l-methionine restriction on the transcription rate of the MAT2A gene in HepG2 cells by performing nuclear run-on studies. We observed that the transcription rate of the MAT2A gene remained constant at different time points after l-methionine withdrawal for up to 4 h; similarly, the transcription rate of GAPDH was not affected under this condition (Fig. 4A). We next tested whether ongoing transcription or translation was necessary for the observed induction of MAT2A mRNA levels in response to l-methionine restriction. For this purpose, cells were grown in complete MEM until 70% confluence and then transferred to l-methionine-restricted MEM in the presence of either actinomycin D (ActD) (5 μg/ml) or cycloheximide (0.1 mm) for 3 h. As shown in Fig. 4, B and C, both treatments completely abolished the induction of MAT2A mRNA levels. These observations indicate that both transcription and protein synthesis are required for the up-regulation of MAT2A gene expression during l-methionine depletion. MAT2A mRNA Is Stabilized in l-Methionine-depleted Cells—Taken together, our data suggest that l-methionine restriction increases MAT2A gene expression by stabilizing the mRNA. To support this hypothesis, we determined MAT2A mRNA half-life in complete and in l-methionine-depleted MEM. HepG2 cells growing in complete MEM were incubated for different periods of time in the presence or absence of ActD (5 μg/ml), and MAT2A mRNA levels were measured by Northern blotting. Under this condition, we could estimate that MAT2A mRNA decayed with a half-life of ∼100 min in l-methionine-supplemented medium (Fig. 5A). In order to determine MAT2A mRNA half-life in l-methionine-restricted medium, cells were cultured in the absence of this amino acid for 4 h and then treated with ActD (5 μg/ml) for up to 3 h in the same medium. As shown in Fig. 5B, the level of MAT2A mRNA remained constant in l-methionine-depleted cells, suggesting an mRNA half-life much longer than 3 h. We wanted to further explore the mechanisms through which l-methionine could mediate this acute regulation of MAT2A mRNA levels. We first determined whether AdoMet and MTA were acting on MAT2A gene expression also at the level of mRNA stability. For this purpose, HepG2 cells were incubated for 4 h in l-methionine-deficient MEM, and then AdoMet (4 mm) or MTA (500 μm) was added to the cultures in the absence or presence of ActD (5 μg/ml) and incubations continued up to 6 h more. Analysis of MAT2A gene expression under these treatments indicated that both AdoMet and MTA shared with l-methionine its ability to down-regulate MAT2A mRNA in the absence of ongoing transcription (Fig. 6). Interestingly, MTA needed to be metabolized through the methionine salvage pathway to exert its effect on MAT2A mRNA levels, since the concomitant addition of adenine (1 mm), an inhibitor of MTAP, the first and rate-limiting enzyme in this pathway (33Olteanu H. Banerjee R. Homocysteine in Health and Disease. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK2001: 135-144Google Scholar), completely blocked its effect (Fig. 6). Of particular relevance is the observation that l-methionine has to be metabolized and converted into AdoMet to mediate its effect on MAT2A mRNA levels, as evidenced when l-methionine treatment was performed in the presence of cycloleucine (20 mm), a competitive inhibitor of MAT activity (34Garrow T. Homocysteine in Health and Disease. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK2001: 145-152Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). If under these conditions (treatment with l-methionine and cycloleucine) exogenous AdoMet (4 mm) was added to the cells, MAT2A mRNA levels were down-regulated (Fig. 6). The addition of either adenine or cycloleucine to l-methionine-starved cells had no effect on MAT2A mRNA levels (data not shown). As previously mentioned, an essential role of l-methionine, through its conversion into AdoMet, is to provide the cell with the necessary activated methyl groups for a vast number of transmethylation reactions. Hence, it was important to know if a transmethylation reaction(s) could be involved in the regulation of MAT2A mRNA levels. For this purpose, l-methionine-deprived cells were treated with l-methionine in the presence of the adenosine analog 3-deazaadenosine (C3-Ado) (30 μM, 30 min prior to l-methionine addition) (37Chiang P.K. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 77: 115-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). C3-Ado is an inhibitor of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase and leads to a significant increase in the intracellular levels of AdoHcy; additionally, it can be converted into the more stable 3-deaza-derivative of AdoHcy (S-3-deaza-adenosylhomocysteine (C3-AdoHcy)) (37Chiang P.K. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 77: 115-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). AdoHcy and C3-AdoHcy are strong inhibitors of methylation reactions (14Mato J.M. Alvarez L. Ortiz P. Pajares M.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 73: 265-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 37Chiang P.K. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 77: 115-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We observed that the effect of l-methionine was preserved in the presence of C3-Ado (Fig. 6), suggesting that methylation reactions were not involved in the regulation of MAT2A gene expression by this amino acid. In this work, we have provided evidence for the acute regulation of MAT2A gene expression in response to the availability of l-methionine. Incubation of human hepatoma HepG2 cells (and HuH7 cells; not shown) in medium restricted in this amino acid resulted in the rapid induction of MAT2A mRNA levels in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. A parallel increase in MAT activity was observed in cells cultured under reduced l-methionine availability, suggesting that translation of MAT2A mRNA was taking place even in the presence of limiting amounts of l-methionine. This observation is in agreement with other reports showing the induction of specific proteins under limited availability of l-methionine (38Bruhat A. Jousse C. Wang X.Z. Ron D. Ferrara M. Fafournoux P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17588-17593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 39Lu S. Epner D.E. Nutr. Cancer. 2000; 38: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). MAT2A gene response seemed to be mainly due to changes in l-methionine levels and not to fluctuations in other amino acids or nutrients. This may be inferred by our experiments in which HepG2 cells were incubated in KRB buffer and induction of MAT2A gene expression was modulated by the sole addition of l-methionine. As mentioned previously, besides its role in protein synthesis, l-methionine enters a metabolic pathway in which it is converted, together with ATP, into AdoMet, the main methyl donor compound in the cell. It was important to know if the observed response of MAT2A gene to fluctuations in l-methionine levels could be related to this metabolic pathway. We observed that AdoMet addition to l-methionine-starved cultures was effective in down-regulating the expression of MAT2A gene. This observation, together with the finding that the nonmetabolizable d-isomer of methionine had no effect on MAT2A mRNA levels, provided the first evidence supporting the concept that l-methionine mediates its effect on MAT2A gene expression through its conversion into AdoMet. We also tested the effect of other molecules that are subsequent metabolic products of l-methionine and AdoMet, such as homocysteine and MTA. Homocysteine treatment had no effect on MAT2A mRNA levels, suggesting that this metabolite was not involved in the cellular signaling of l-methionine limitation. Homocysteine can serve as a precursor of l-methionine in all cells; however, transformed cells, including hepatoma cells, are unable to grow if homocysteine is used in place of methionine in culture medium (13Hoffman R.M. Anticancer Res. 1985; 5: 1-30PubMed Google Scholar, 40Avila M.A. Berasain C. Torres L. Martín-Duce A. Corrales F.J. Yang H. Prieto J. Lu S.C. Caballería J. Rodés J. Mato J.M. J.

Our present data further support this notion. With regard to MTA, a product of AdoMet metabolism in the polyamine biosynthetic pathway and a precursor of l-methionine in the so-called methionine salvage pathway, we observed that it was able to modulate MAT2A mRNA levels in l-methionine-starved cultures. As we later observed, MTA effect was dependent on its metabolism through the methionine salvage pathway and therefore probably due to its ultimate conversion into this amino acid and subsequently into AdoMet. Adenine, a product of MTA metabolism and an inhibitor of MTAP, the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the methionine salvage pathway (30Tabor H. Tabor C W. Pharmacol. Rev. 1964; 16: 245-300PubMed Google Scholar, 31Williams-Ashman H.G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1982; 31: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 32Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 759-774PubMed Google Scholar, 35White M.W. Vandenbark A.A. Barney C.L. Ferro A.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1982; 31: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), blocked MTA effect. Methionine dependence of tumor cells has been associated with defects in MTAP expression leading to the suppression of this salvage pathway (13Hoffman R.M. Anticancer Res. 1985; 5: 1-30PubMed Google Scholar, 41Tang B. Li Y.N. Kruger W.D. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5543-5547PubMed Google Scholar, 42Dumontet C. Roch A.M. Quash G. Oncol. Res. 1996; 8: 469-471PubMed Google Scholar); however, this is not the case for HepG2, where we found that MTAP expression was normal (data not shown). Additionally, these data attest to the importance of the methionine salvage pathway in methionine conservation under limited supply of this amino acid and further support the relevance of this metabolic route as a target in antineoplastic therapy. We have provided evidence showing that MAT2A gene transcription remained constant during l-methionine starvation at least up to 4 h after the removal of this amino acid from the culture medium. These data suggested that the potent effect of l-methionine on MAT2A gene expression might take place at the post-transcriptional level. In the regulation of gene expression by amino acids, both types of mechanisms, namely the regulation of gene transcription and of mRNA stability, have been described. For instance, transcription of the asparagine synthetase gene and the stability of the high affinity cationic amino acid transporter-1 mRNA are known to be modulated by amino acid starvation (43Van Leung-Pineda Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16585-16591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 44Aulak K.S. Mishra R. Zhou L. Hyatt S.L. De Jonge W. Lamers W. Snider Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30424-30432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the case of certain genes, such as cationic amino acid transporter-1, changes in its mRNA turnover rate alone account for the dramatic induction on the expression of this gene in amino acid-depleted medium (44Aulak K.S. Mishra R. Zhou L. Hyatt S.L. De Jonge W. Lamers W. Snider Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30424-30432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 46Yaman I.

Because the MAT2A gene transcription rate was not significantly altered by l-methionine starvation, we measured MAT2A mRNA half-life in l-methionine-fed and -starved cultures. We observed a significant increase in MAT2A mRNA half-life in response to l-methionine starvation. Interestingly, this effect was completely dependent on de novo protein synthesis. This observation suggests that a protein factor(s) may be synthesized that binds and stabilizes MAT2A mRNA when cellular l-methionine levels are reduced. This kind of mechanism has been reported for the regulation of mRNAs encoding proteins such as transferrin receptor (45Klausner R.D. Harford J.B. Science. 1989; 246: 870-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), the cationic amino acid transporter-1 (46Yaman I. Fernández J. Sarkar B. Schneider R.J. Snider M.D. Nagy L.E. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41539-41546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and others (47Chen F.Y. Amara F.M. Wright J.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3977-3986Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Once we established that MAT2A gene expression was regulated by l-methionine at the level of mRNA turnover, we confirmed that the observed effects of AdoMet and MTA on MAT2A steady state mRNA levels were also mediated at this same level. In these experiments, it was also clearly established that l-methionine per se was not sufficient to convey the cellular signal(s) that modulated MAT2A mRNA turnover. Conversion of l-methionine into AdoMet was absolutely necessary, given the fact that cycloleucine, a competitive inhibitor of MAT II activity (34Garrow T. Homocysteine in Health and Disease. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK2001: 145-152Google Scholar), completely abolished l-methionine action. In line with this is the observation that when exogenous AdoMet was added, the blockade imposed by cycloleucine on l-methionine effect was overcome. Taken together, these findings provide an explanation for our previous observations made in MAT1A knockout mice. These animals display dramatically elevated levels of circulating l-methionine (around 8-fold increase compared with wild type mice), and at the same time the expression of the MAT2A gene is induced in their liver (21Lu S.C. Alvarez L. Huang Z.Z. Chen L. An W. Corrales F.J. Avila M.A. Kanel G. Mato J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5560-5565Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). These seemingly contradictory observations may be explained by the fact that the hepatic concentration of AdoMet in these knockout mice is reduced to about 25% of that found in wild type animals (21Lu S.C. Alvarez L. Huang Z.Z. Chen L. An W. Corrales F.J. Avila M.A. Kanel G. Mato J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5560-5565Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Another interesting finding was the observation that treatment with C3-Ado, a compound that increases the intracellular concentration of AdoHcy, and C3-AdoHcy, two potent inhibitors of methylation reactions, did not interfere with the effect of l-methionine on MAT2A mRNA levels. This finding suggests that a methylation reaction is not involved in the effect of l-methionine (and consequently of AdoMet) on MAT2A gene expression, although we cannot exclude a methyl transfer reaction that would be resistant to AdoHcy or C3-AdoHcy inhibition. We have previously described that AdoMet is able to induce the transcription of the MAT1A gene in cultured rat hepatocytes (24Carretero M.V. Latasa M.U. García-Trevijano E.R. Corrales F.J. Wagner C. Mato J.M. Avila M.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 1119-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 25García-Trevijano E.R. Latasa M.U. Carretero M.V. Mato J.M. Avila M.A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2511-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and that in this effect a methylation reaction is probably involved (24Carretero M.V. Latasa M.U. García-Trevijano E.R. Corrales F.J. Wagner C. Mato J.M. Avila M.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 1119-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Now we report on a novel effect of AdoMet on gene expression that occurs at the postranscriptional level and in which a different mechanism of action is seemingly involved. An alternative mode of action for AdoMet could be its direct binding to a cellular target structure. Such interaction of AdoMet is known to occur in eukaryotic cells, and the best characterized target is the enzyme cystathionine β-synthase, which is allosterically regulated by AdoMet binding to a specific domain termed the cystathionine β-synthase domain (49Janosik M. Kery V. Gaustadnes M. Maclean K.N. Kraus J.P. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 192: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this cystathionine β-synthase domain is a widespread structure that was originally described in archaebacteria and is well conserved throughout evolution (50Bateman A. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 12-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Given the central role played by AdoMet in cellular metabolism, the sharp induction in MAT2A gene expression in response to reduced l-methionine and AdoMet availability could be regarded as an adaptive mechanism of the cell aimed at preserving the intracellular levels of AdoMet. As we have shown, this is a finely tuned response, and we can envision different potential explanations for this to be so. In the first place, for each AdoMet molecule synthesized, one ATP molecule and one l-methionine molecule are consumed at the expense of the homeostasis of cellular energetics and protein synthesis (10Finkelstein J.D. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1990; 1: 228-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar, 11Mato J.M. Avila M.A. Corrales F.J. Homocysteine in Health and Disease. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK2001: 47-62Google Scholar). Additionally, recent observations suggest that AdoMet plays a role in the cell that transcends its purely metabolic function as a methyl donor and metabolic intermediate (reviewed in Ref. 26Mato J.M. Corrales F.J. Lu S.C. Avila M.A. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Changes in AdoMet levels modulate proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation, so its synthesis needs to be carefully controlled. In this regard, the inhibitory effect of AdoMet on MAT II activity has been well characterized (12Finkelstein J.D. Martin J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1582-1587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hoffman R.M. Anticancer Res. 1985; 5: 1-30PubMed Google Scholar, 48Sullivan D.M. Hoffman J.L. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1636-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Our present observations represent a novel action of AdoMet in the regulation of cellular physiology, this time modulating its own production also through the regulation of MAT2A mRNA stability.

The first 53 amino acids in Tcf4 constitute the cateninbinding domain (CBD) of this protein. The N-terminal sequence stretch of Tcf4 is highly acidic and is not folded in solution (11Knapp S.

Several crystal structures have been determined to date; one structure is available for the Xenopus xTcf3-β-catenin complex, and two structures have been determined for human Tcf4-β-catenin complexes (12Graham T.A. Weaver C. Mao F. Kimelman D. Xu W. Cell. 2000; 103: 885-896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 13Poy F. Lepourcelet M. Shivdasani R.A. Eck M.J. Nat. Struct.

Structural alignments of the two human Tcf4-β-catenin complexes and the homologous structure of xTcf3-β-catenin revealed a number of surprising conformational differences, in particular in the N-terminal and the extended regions of Tcf, indicating a high degree of molecular plasticity. Because the Tcf4 ligand is not implicated in crystal packing in any of the published structures, the observed differences might be a result of changes in solvent conditions (12Graham T.A. Weaver C. Mao F. Kimelman D. Xu W. Cell. 2000; 103: 885-896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 13Poy F. Lepourcelet M. Shivdasani R.A. Eck M.J. Nat. Struct.

Structural data as well as co-immunoprecipitation assays have suggested that the main interaction points for the recognition of β-catenin by Tcf are two regions of highly positive electrostatic potential. These so-called charge buttons are formed by the β-catenin residues Lys435, Arg469, His470, Asn426, and Lys508 as well as Lys312 that interact with the xTcf3 residues Asp16, Glu17, and Glu24, respectively (12Graham T.A. Weaver C. Mao F. Kimelman D. Xu W. Cell. 2000; 103: 885-896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The importance of the first charge button for Lef1 binding has been described previously in a mutagenesis study on β-catenin (15von Kies J.P. Winbeck G. Asbrand C. Schwarz-Romond T. Sochnikova N. Dell'Oro A. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 800-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In addition, several hydrophobic contacts such as those formed by the Tcf residues Phe21 and Val48 have been reported to be important for Tcf4 binding to β-catenin (16Omer C.A. Miller P.J. Diehl R.E. Kral. A.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 584-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Calorimetric, intrinsic fluorescent quenching and surface plasmon resonance binding data have shown that Tcf4 binds to β-catenin armadillo with a binding constant of 3 ± 2 × 108 mol-1. At 20 °C, the interaction is strongly favored by a large negative binding enthalpy that is strongly temperature-dependent and gives rise to a heat capacity change (ΔCp) of -1.5 kcal/(mol K) (11Knapp S. Zamai M. Volpi D. Avanzi N. Breton J. Plyte S. Flocco M. Marconi M. Caiolfa V. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To define interaction hot spots on Tcf4 that may be mimicked by low molecular weight antagonists and to understand the interactions with β-catenin, we mutated all residues in Tcf that make significant contacts with β-catenin. The binding of the Tcf mutants was subsequently studied by isothermal titration calorimetry, which allowed not only the determination of binding constants in solution but also gave insight into the binding energetics of the Tcf4 mutants. Our study defined residue Asp16 as the most important interaction point of Tcf4. The mutation D16A results in a large decrease in binding enthalpy and binding constant. Single site mutations of Tcf4 residues interacting with the second charge button on β-catenin resulted in only marginal changes of the binding constant but significantly reduced binding enthalpies. In general, mutations of polar Tcf residues in the Tcf-β-catenin interface resulted in less favorable binding enthalpies. For most mutants, this effect was largely compensated for by entropic contributions to the binding, indicating a large degree of cooperativity in this interaction. Another residue that was found to decrease binding constants and alter binding energetics when mutated to alanine was Asp11, which has been found to be disordered in the crystal structures of the Tcf4-β-catenin complex. This finding demonstrates that even residues that are disordered in crystal structures might significantly contribute to binding affinity and alter binding energetics upon mutation. In addition, an important cluster of hydrophobic residues for the interactions of Tcf4 with β-catenin was defined by the alanine mutants of the residues Leu41, Val44, and Leu48 of the C-terminal helix of the Tcf-CBD. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Proteins—The armadillo repeat region (amino acid residues 134–671) in β-catenin was cloned and purified as described previously (11Knapp S. Zamai M. Volpi D. Avanzi N. Breton J. Plyte S. Flocco M. Marconi M. Caiolfa V. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Tcf4-CBD (residues 1–56) was cloned into the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites of pET20b. To quantitate the recombinant Tcf4 protein spectroscopically, a tryptophane residue was introduced between the CBD and the C-terminal His6 tag. Sitedirected mutagenesis of Tcf4 was performed using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) and oligonucleotides that were complementary to 15 bp upstream and downstream of the mutation site on both strands. Tcf4-CBD mutants were transformed into Escherichia coli (BL21-DE3). Transformed bacteria were grown to mid-log phase at 37 °Cin2× yeast tryptone medium, and protein expression was induced by addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Induced cells were then grown for 3 h and harvested by centrifugation. Cell pellets were resuspended and lysed in PBS (Sigma) using a French press. The recombinant proteins were purified using pre-charged Ni-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia) and a standard protocol (Novagen). The proteins were judged to be pure after affinity chromatography as assessed by SDS-PAGE and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Tcf4 wild type and mutants were quantitated using an absorbance coefficient at 280 nm of 5.69 × 103 mol/cm. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Calorimetric measurements were carried out at constant temperatures using a VP-isothermal titration calorimetry titration calorimeter (MicroCal). Samples were extensively dialyzed against PBS, 1 mm DTT. Heats of dilution were measured in blank titrations by injecting the protein into the buffer used in the particular experiment and subtracted from the binding heats. Thermodynamic parameters were determined by non-linear least squares methods using routines included in the Origin software package (MicroCal). Due to the large binding enthalpy of the interaction, a protein concentration in the calorimeter of 2 μm was sufficient to obtain a good signal-to-noise ratio and to reduce “c-values” (c = KB [P] N; [P] = protein concentration; N = stoichiometry) below 500. Measured thermodynamic values are usually a function of solvent conditions. To indicate this, observed binding enthalpy and entropy changes are abbreviated as ΔHobs and ΔSobs, respectively throughout this publication.

The results were analyzed on the basis of the published structures of Tcf-β-catenin complexes. The studied protein domain of Tcf4 contained residues 1–56, which have been shown to be sufficient for high affinity binding to β-catenin (11Knapp S. Zamai M. Volpi D. Avanzi N. Breton J. Plyte S.

To determine the protein concentration spectroscopically and facilitate purification, we introduced a tryptophane residue and a His6 tag at the C terminus of Tcf-CBD. These additional C-terminal residues did not alter binding affinities for β-catenin (Table I). In this study we noted that the slightly different solvent conditions used (PBS, 1 mm DTT) result in somewhat smaller binding enthalpies than reported in an earlier study in which a buffer of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 2 mm DTT was used.

The region that was well defined started with Tcf4 residue Leu12 in the structure determined by Graham et al. (Protein Data Bank accession number 1jdh, referred to henceforth as Tcf41jdh) (12Graham T.A. Weaver C. Mao F. Kimelman D. Xu W. Cell. 2000; 103: 885-896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) and residue Gly13 in the structure determined by Poy et al. (Protein Data Bank accession number 1jpw, referred to henceforth as Tcf41jpw) (13Poy F. Lepourcelet M. Shivdasani R.A. Eck M.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 12: 1053-1057Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This finding is surprising, considering the high sequence similarity between xTcf3 and Tcf4 (Fig. 2). In xTcf3, the main side chain interactions are formed by Asp10, which forms a salt bridge with the β-catenin residue Arg474, and Glu11, which interacts with His578, Arg582, Arg612, and Tyr654 on β-catenin (Fig. 2). In the two Tcf4 structures reported, the location of the N terminus is quite different. Whereas in Tcf41jdh residues 12–16 superimpose well with the corresponding residues in xTcf3, the N terminus in Tcf41jpw does not interact with β-catenin and is oriented toward the solvent. The first 12 N-terminal residues in Tcf4 have been shown to be dispensable in solid phase competition assays (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) as well as in reporter gene assays (16Omer C.A. Miller P.J. Diehl R.E. Kral. A.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 584-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 15von Kies J.P. Winbeck G. Asbrand C. Schwarz-Romond T. Sochnikova N. Dell'Oro A. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 800-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Indeed, deletion of the first 9 (ND9) or 12 (ND12) residues of Tcf4 had only a marginal effect on binding constants (Table I), whereas binding enthalpies were found to be reduced by about 5 kcal/mol. This suggests that the Tcf4 N terminus interacts with β-catenin but that it does not contribute to binding free energy change due to enthalpy-entropy compensation mechanisms. A similar effect was observed for the mutation D10A, which bound with a ΔΔHobs of +6.5 kcal/mol but with a binding constant similar to that of wild type Tcf4. Interestingly, the mutation D11A also reduced the KB of the interaction by about 5-fold. Thus, the mutation D11A has a larger effect on the binding of Tcf4 than deletions of the entire N terminus. It has been observed previously that effects of single mutations may be much stronger than the contribution of the entire site as a whole (18Albeck S. Unger R. Schreiber G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 503-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Cooperative effects are usually invoked to explain such observations. However, the observed data might also be the result of local changes in protein structure, differences in the dynamics of both proteins, or changes in surface hydration. To confirm this result, we also mutated the residues on β-catenin that interact with Glu11 in xTcf3. The mutations R612A and Y654A did not significantly affect binding of wild type Tcf4 (Table II). Surprisingly, we observed an ∼30-fold decrease in binding constant for wild type Tcf4 for the β-catenin mutations H578A and R582A, suggesting that wild type Tcf4 interacts with this binding site on β-catenin. The Tcf4 residue Asp11 corresponds to a glutamic acid in xTcf3. Possibly, the elongation of the side chain by one CH2 group at this critical position renders this interaction more favorable. Due to the lack of structural information on the Tcf4 N terminus, we can only speculate about the molecular mechanisms that give rise to this binding behavior. However, the measured data demonstrated that under the chosen experimental conditions, the N-terminal residues of Tcf4 do interact in solution with β-catenin and that this interaction involves the β-catenin residues that are contacted by xTcf3.Table IIITC measurements of β-catenin mutants (Tcf Asp11binding site)β-Catenin mutantKBΔHobsTΔSobsΔGobsNaN, stoichiometry of the interaction108m-1kcal/molkcal/molkcal/molWTWHis6bWTWHis6, wild type Tcf4 with a C-terminal tryptophane residue and His tag3.5 ± 1.5-24.5 ± 1.8-12.8 ± 0.8-11.7 ± 1.11.05 ± 0.2H578A0.14 ± 0.02-19.8 ± 1.0-10.1 ± 0.4-9.7 ± 0.30.97 ± 0.05R582A0.17 ± 0.02-22.8 ± 0.6-13.0 ± 0.4-9.8 ± 0.30.96 ± 0.02R612A1.5 ± 1.1-28.0 ± 1.0-17.0 ± 0.7-11.0 ± 0.10.97 ± 0.03Y654A5.1 ± 2.1-27.3 ± 1.2-15.4 ± 1.1-11.9 ± 0.20.99 ± 0.05a N, stoichiometry of the interactionb WTWHis6, wild type Tcf4 with a C-terminal tryptophane residue and His tag Open table in a new tab Interaction of the Tcf4 Extended Region—This region is structurally very conserved among the three reported Tcf structures and superimposes very well with residues 671–686 of the β-catenin ligand E-cadherin as well as the Tcf antagonist ICAT (19Huber A.H.

The Tcf extended region binds along a shallow groove with highly positively charged surface patches (charge buttons). Consequently, the electrostatic interactions observed in the β-catenin-Tcf complexes have been discussed as the main interaction sites that drive the binding of Tcf (12Graham T.A. Weaver C. Mao F. Kimelman D. Xu W. Cell. 2000; 103: 885-896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis data on β-catenin showed that mutation of the residues Lys435, Asn426, His470, Arg469, and Lys508 to alanine strongly reduces binding of Lef1 and Tcf4 in co-immunoprecipitation experiments (15von Kies J.P. Winbeck G. Asbrand C. Schwarz-Romond T. Sochnikova N. Dell'Oro A. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 800-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). These residues form polar contacts with Tcf4 residues 16–19. Asp16 has been identified previously as a critical residue for Tcf binding (11Knapp S. Zamai M. Volpi D. Avanzi N. Breton J. Plyte S. Flocco M. Marconi M. Caiolfa V. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 16Omer C.A. Miller P.J. Diehl R.E. Kral. A.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 584-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The Tcf4 residue Asp16 forms hydrogen bonds with the β-catenin residues Lys435 and His470 as well as several water-mediated hydrogen bond networks (Fig. 2). We find in this study that the residue Asp16 defines the most important interaction hot spot on Tcf4. The mutation D16A resulted in a ΔΔG of +2.4 kcal/mol. The neighboring residue Glu17 forms a salt bridge with Lys508. However, upon mutation of Glu17 to alanine, the binding constant decreased only ∼3-fold (11Knapp S. Zamai M. Volpi D. Avanzi N. Breton J. Plyte S. Flocco M. Marconi M. Caiolfa V. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The interaction with the first charge button is followed in Tcf4 by the hydrophobic residues Leu18, Ile19, and Phe21, which interact with hydrophobic groups of the β-catenin residues Thr393, Cys429, Cys466, Ala467, Pro463, and Arg386 (Fig. 3). Single alanine mutants of Leu18, Ile19, and Phe21 did not significantly affect Tcf4 binding in isothermal titration calorimetry experiments. For the related transcription factor Lef1, an important contribution of residue Phe24 for β-catenin binding (Phe21 in Tcf4) has been discussed using a yeast two-hybrid system. This residue has also been shown to be important for the translocation of endogenous β-catenin into the nucleus (15von Kies J.P. Winbeck G. Asbrand C. Schwarz-Romond T. Sochnikova N. Dell'Oro A. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 800-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In addition, the Tcf4 double mutant I19A,F21A has been shown to reduce reporter gene activity by ∼40% in transient transfection experiments (13Poy F. Lepourcelet M. Shivdasani R.A. Eck M.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 12: 1053-1057Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In light of our binding data, it is likely that mechanisms other than β-catenin binding are responsible for the observed effect of these mutants in these cell-based experiments. The cluster of hydrophobic Tcf4 residues is followed by negatively charged residues, which form the interaction with the second charge button defined by the β-catenin residue Lys312. The three-dimensional structure of this region differs significantly in the two Tcf4 crystal structures published. As in xTcf3, in Tcf41jpw the interaction with the second charge button is made by Glu24, whereas in Tcf41jdh, a similar interaction is formed by Glu28. In this structure, Glu24 makes no interaction with β-catenin but points to the solvent space. For the mutant E24A, we found a significant difference in binding enthalpy (ΔΔHobs, +7.4 kcal/mol), which is, however, largely offset by favorable entropic contributions. This mutation resulted in a ΔΔGobs of only 0.9 kcal/mol and an ∼4-fold decreased binding constant. The mutant E28A resulted in only moderate reduction of ΔHobs and in similar binding constants with respect to the wild-type protein. In addition to Glu28, Glu29 also makes polar contacts to the second charge button in Tcf41jdh. The observed difference in ΔHobs of 5.8 kcal/mol for mutant E29A supports such an interaction, even though binding constants are not altered. This highly acidic region compensates for single mutations as indicated by the structural plasticity shown by the two structures of Tcf4-β-catenin complexes. This hypothesis is supported by co-immunoprecipitation experiments, demonstrating that the mutation of all 4 glutamate residues in that region (Glu24, Glu26, Glu28, and Glu29) abolishes binding to β-catenin, whereas single mutations had either no effect or only a small effect on binding (14Graham T.A. Ferkey D.M. Mao F. Kimelman D. Xu W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1048-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Mutation N34A only moderately changed ΔHobs and had a negligible effect on the binding constants. This residue is"

SCT and the other known SCPL acyltransferases all share the conserved serine, aspartic acid, and histidine residues employed for catalysis by classical serine carboxypeptidases, although the importance of these residues and the mechanism by which this class of SCPL proteins catalyze acyltransferase reactions is unknown. To characterize further SCT and its catalytic mechanism, we have employed the Saccharomyces cerevisiae vacuolar protein localization 1 mutant, which secretes the serine carboxypeptidase, carboxypeptidase Y, and other proteins normally targeted to the vacuole. When expressed in this strain, SCT is similarly secreted. SCT has been purified from the yeast medium and used for kinetic characterization of the protein. Immunological analysis of SCT has revealed that the expected 50-kDa mature protein is proteolytically processed in yeast and in planta, most likely resulting in the production of a heterodimer derived from a 30- and 17-kDa polypeptide.

In Arabidopsis and some other members of the Brassicaceae, the end products of the phenylpropanoid pathway include the sinapate esters, sinapoylmalate and sinapoylcholine. Sinapoylglucose:malate sinapoyltransferase (SMT) 1The abbreviations used are: SMT, sinapoylglucose:malate sinapoyltransferase; SCT, sinapoylglucose:choline sinapoyltransferase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SCPL, serine carboxypeptidase-like; CPY, carboxypeptidase Y; LC, liquid chromatography, HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry, ESI, electrospray ionization; Q-TOF, quadrupole-time-of-flight; CPDW-II, carboxypeptidase II. catalyzes the final reaction in the formation of sinapoylmalate, the predominant sinapate ester and a major UV protectant in Arabidopsis leaves (1Landry L.G.

Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1275-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The most abundant sinapate ester in seeds is sinapoylcholine, also known as sinapine, the formation of which is catalyzed by sinapoylglucose:choline sinapoyltransferase (SCT) (Fig. 1). Radiotracer feeding experiments with [14C]choline and [14C]ethanolamine indicated that sinapoylcholine may serve as an important seed storage form of choline for the subsequent synthesis of phosphatidylcholine in developing seedlings (3Strack D. Z. Naturforsch. 1981; 36: 215-221Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In contrast, the isolation of the fah1 and sng2 mutants, each of which accumulates free choline instead of sinapoylcholine (4Chapple C.C.S. Vogt T. Ellis B.E. Somerville C.R. Plant Cell. 1992; 16: 735-743Google Scholar, 5Shirley A.M. McMichael C.M. Chapple C. Plant J. 2001; 28: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), suggests that the function of sinapoylcholine is still unclear. Nevertheless, the accumulation of sinapoylcholine in seeds is of agronomic importance because it has a negative impact on the value of canola (Brassica sp.) meal (6Hobson-Frohock A. Fenwick G.R. Heaney R.K. Land D.G. Curtis R.F. Br. Poult. Sci. 1977; 18: 539-541Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Both SMT and SCT belong to a newly described class of proteins from plant secondary metabolism that are homologous to serine carboxypeptidases and yet function as acyltransferases (5Shirley A.M.

Until recently, serine carboxypeptidase-like (SCPL) proteins from plants had been identified and characterized based primarily upon their ability to degrade model peptide substrates (10Bamforth C.W. Martin H.L. Wainwright T. J. Inst. Brew. 1979; 85: 334-338Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 11Umetsu H. Ichishima E.

Plant Physiol. 1986; 81: 823-829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the in vivo targets of most of these enzymes remain unknown, serine carboxypeptidases have traditionally been thought to function in protein turnover and processing because they catalyze the hydrolytic cleavage of C-terminal peptide bonds. Serine carboxypeptidases belong to the larger α/β hydrolase superfamily of proteins and contain conserved serine, aspartic acid, and histidine residues that make up a catalytic triad (14Bech L.M.

Sussman J.L. Verschueren K.H.G. Goldman A. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1848) Google Scholar). The proposed mechanism of catalysis is similar to serine endopeptidases, which involves the formation of an acyl enzyme intermediate followed by its subsequent hydrolysis. Considering their apparent evolutionary relationship with hydrolases, the mechanism by which SCPL proteins act as acyltransferases is of significant interest. Kinetic analysis of SCT has been reported previously following full or partial purification of the enzyme from seeds of Raphanus sativus, Sinapis alba, and Brassica napus (20Gräwe W. Strack D. Z. Naturforsch. 1986; 41: 28-33Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 21Vogt T. Aebershold R. Ellis B Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 622-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar); however, these studies have provided conflicting reports concerning the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme. In light of the recent cloning of SCT from Arabidopsis and the identification of SCT as an SCPL protein (5Shirley A.M. McMichael C.M. Chapple C. Plant J. 2001; 28: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), in this paper we describe a detailed analysis of activity, substrate specificity, and processing of SCT. These results were obtained using a novel heterologous Saccharomyces cerevisiae expression system that lacks the carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) gene and is defective in vacuolar targeting, resulting in secretion of heterologously expressed SCT. Yeast Strains—The construction of the S. cerevisiae strain W2579 (MAT a Δprc1 vpl1-1 leu2-3 leu2-112 ura3-52) has been described (22Nielsen T.L. Holmberg S. Petersen J.G.L. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1990; 33: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The W2579 strain was obtained from Carlsberg Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark. Constructs for Expression of SCT in S. cerevisiae—Standard techniques were used for DNA manipulations (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For construction of the SCT yeast expression vector, two oligonucleotides were designed to amplify the SCT cDNA. The 5′-oligonucleotide (5′-GAATTCAAAATGGGAAACCTTAGC-3′) incorporated an EcoRI restriction site before the SCT start codon, and the 3′-oligonucleotide (5′-GCATGCGTCTTAAACTGTAACAAC-3′) incorporated an SphI restriction site after the stop codon. The SCT gene was amplified by PCR, subcloned into EcoRV-digested pBS KS-, and sequenced using thermosequenase fluorescent-labeled primer cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences) with the IRD-800 M13 forward and IRD-700 M13 reverse primers (LICOR, Lincoln, NE). The reaction products were analyzed with the LongReadIR DNA 4200 automated DNA sequencer (LICOR, Lincoln, NE). The coding sequence was then excised by EcoRI/SphI digestion and cloned into EcoRI/SphI-digested pYES2 vector (Invitrogen) to yield pYES2-SCT. For analysis of SCT expression and activity, the S. cerevisiae host W2579 (22Nielsen T.L. Holmberg S. Petersen J.G.L. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1990; 33: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) was transformed with the empty pYES2 vector and pYES2-SCT as described (24Johnston J.R. Johnston J.R. Molecular Genetics of Yeast: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1994: 121-134Google Scholar). Yeast Growth Conditions and Preparation of Yeast Extracts—W2579 cells carrying pYES2 and pYES2-SCT were grown in media supplemented with 100 mg liter-1 of l-leucine to complement the leucine-deficient W2579 strain. SCT production was induced by the addition of galactose to stationary phase cultures (25Urban P. Werck-Reichhart D. Teutsch H. Durst F. Regnier S. Kazmaier M. Pompon D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). After 24 h, cultures were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min. To assay SCT retained within cells, cell pellets were resuspended in two volumes of 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.0). One cell volume of 0.5 mm of zirconia/silica beads (Biospec Products Inc., Bartlesville, OH) was added, and the cell suspension was vortexed at high speed for 1 min and then placed on ice for 1 min. This process was repeated four additional times. The cell lysate was then centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min and assayed for SCT activity as described below. To assay SCT secreted from cells, protein was precipitated from the yeast medium by adding solid ammonium sulfate to obtain 50% saturation. After stirring for 30 min, the precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min and discarded. The supernatant was then raised to 70% saturation with ammonium sulfate, and after stirring for 30 min, the precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min. The ammonium sulfate precipitate was dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), containing 1 mm 1,4-dithio-dl-threitol, and was dialyzed for 18 h against two changes of 4 liters of the same buffer. The dialysate was then incubated at 60 °C for 10 min, cooled to 4 °C, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was then passed through a Q-Sepharose fast flow (Sigma) column (30-ml bed volume) that had been equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The column flow-through was collected and made to 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MnCl2. The sample was then applied to a concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B (Sigma) column (3-ml bed volume) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min-1. The column was washed with 3 times with 4 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, and then the bound protein was eluted with 3 times with 4 ml of wash buffer containing 0.6 m methyl-α-d-mannopyranoside. The bound protein fraction was dialyzed for 18 h against two changes of 4 liters of 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.0) containing 20% (v/v) glycerol. The protein was desalted using PD-10 Sephadex® G-25 M columns (Supelco; Belefonte, PA) into 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.0) immediately prior to enzyme assays. Protein content was determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) (26Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Enzyme Assays—SCT assays were initiated by the addition of 5 μl of protein to tubes containing substrate in 20 μl of 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.0). The assays were incubated for 60 min at 30 °C, terminated by the addition of 37.5 μl of methanol, and centrifuged for 10 min at 5,000 × g. In each case, 20 μl of sample was analyzed directly by HPLC on a PuresilTM C18 column (Waters) (120-Å pore size, 5-μm particle size) using a 12-min gradient from 1.5% acetic acid to 22.5% acetonitrile at a flow rate of 1 ml min-1 using UV detection at 335 nm, except for caffeic acid and caffeoylcholine, which were detected at 315 nm. Hydroxycinnamate esters were quantified using the extinction coefficient of the corresponding hydroxycinnamic acids. Sinapoylglucose for use in enzyme assays was purified from the sng1 mutant of Arabidopsis (27Lorenzen M. Racicot V. Strack D. Chapple C. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 1625-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Expression of CPY in S. cerevisiae—The p72UG vector (22Nielsen T.L. Holmberg S. Petersen J.G.L. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1990; 33: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) was obtained from Carlsberg Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark, and was transformed into the host W2579 as described (24Johnston J.R. Johnston J.R. Molecular Genetics of Yeast: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1994: 121-134Google Scholar). Transformed cells were grown in media for 18 h and then induced with galactose (25Urban P. Werck-Reichhart D. Teutsch H. Durst F. Regnier S. Kazmaier M. Pompon D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). After 24 h, the cultures were centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min to pellet the cells, and the supernatant was then assayed directly for CPY activity by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 339 nm of 0.2 mmN-(3-[2-furyl]acryloyl)-Phe-Phe (Sigma) in 50 mm MES and 1 mm EDTA (pH 6.5) over a 30-min period, as described previously (28Peterson L.M. Holmquist B. Bethune J.L. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 125: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Assays to test SCT for carboxypeptidase activity were performed similarly. Plant Material and Preparation of Protein Extracts—Arabidopsis thaliana L. Heynh. ecotype Landsberg erecta (Ler) was cultivated at a light intensity of 100 microeinsteins m-2 s-1 at 23 °C under a photoperiod of 16 h light/8 h dark in Redi-Earth potting mix (Scotts-Sierra Horticultural Products; Marysville, OH). For preparation of protein extracts for gel blot analysis, 10 g of light yellow to fully mature siliques from Ler or sng2 were frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground to a fine powder after which desalted protein extracts were prepared as described previously (5Shirley A.M. McMichael C.M. Chapple C. Plant J. 2001; 28: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Generation of Polyclonal SCT Antibodies—To generate anti-SCT polyclonal antibodies, the predicted mature SCT protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and isolated from the insoluble fraction as described previously (5Shirley A.M. McMichael C.M. Chapple C. Plant J. 2001; 28: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The insoluble fraction containing SCT was electrophoretically separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% acrylamide gel (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). The gel was copper-stained (30Lee C. Levin A. Branton D. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 308-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), and the SCT band was extracted from the gel by electroelution into 20 mm Tris and 150 mm glycine buffer using the ElutrapTM Electroelution System (Schleicher & Schuell). The purified protein was used as antigen for the generation of polyclonal antibodies in rabbit using Cocalico Biologicals, Inc., antibody production services (Reamstown, PA). Immunological Analysis of SCT—Protein gel blotting was performed using a recently developed technique for direct quantification of Cy3 fluorescence. 2J. M. Humphreys and C. Chapple, unpublished data. Briefly, following SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to Westran® polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) in 20 mm Tris, 150 mm glycine, and 20% (v/v) methanol buffer at 50 V for 1 h. The membrane was then washed for 1 h in PBS buffer (80 mm Na2HPO4, 20 mm NaH2PO4, 100 mm NaCl) containing 5% (w/v) powdered milk. The membrane was washed with PBS buffer containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 for 15 min and then incubated for 1 h in 2% powdered milk in PBS buffer containing a 1:1000 dilution of the polyclonal SCT antibody. The membrane was washed again with PBS buffer containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 for 15 min and then incubated in 2% (w/v) powdered milk in PBS buffer containing a 1:1000 dilution of anti-rabbit IgG Cy3TM conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma) for 1 h. The membrane was finally washed with PBS buffer containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 for 15 min. Cy3 fluorescence was visualized using a Typhoon 8600 Variable Mode Imager (Amersham Biosciences) in fluorescence mode using the green 532 nm laser with Tamra 580 BP 30 filter at 400 PMT sensitivity. Deglycosylation of SCT—SCT protein purified from yeast media was concentrated using a Microcon YM-30 (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Concentrated protein (150 μg) was deglycosylated using Recombinant N-Glycanase FTM (Glyko, Novato, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization/Mass Spectrometry— Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry was performed using a PerSeptive Biosystems (Framingham, MA) Voyager mass spectrometer, equipped with a nitrogen laser (337 nm UV laser) for ionization and a time-of-flight mass analyzer. The sample and matrix (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) were mixed in a ratio of 1 to 1 μl on the sample plate and allowed to air-dry prior to analysis. LC/MS—LC-MS analyses were performed on a Micromass Q-TOF hybrid time-of-flight/quadrupole LC/MS system. Samples were separated on a Hewlett-Packard HP-1100 binary liquid chromatography (LC) system with UV diode-array detection. LC separations were performed using a PuresilTM C18 column (Waters) (120-Å pore size, 5-μm particle size) with a 23-min gradient from 1.5% acetic acid to 70% acetonitrile at a flow rate of 1 ml min-1 using UV detection at 335 nm. The post-column effluent stream was split ∼1:4 (ESI:Waste), and the ESI portion was combined with a flow of internal standard using an LC Tee. An internal standard mixture containing ∼10 μg ml-1 spinosad and ∼20 μg ml-1 caffeine was supplied via a Hamilton syringe pump at flows from 1 to 10 μl min-1. The resulting sample stream was introduced into the Q-TOF using the Z-Spray electrospray source. The Q-TOF was operated in both positive electrospray (+ESI) and negative electrospray (-ESI) modes using data-dependent triggering between MS and MS/MS modes. Theoretical values for the [M + H]+ internal standards ions in +ESI were m/z 195.0882 (caffeine) and m/z 732.4687 (spinosyn A). Accurate mass measurements were made using spinosyn A as the reference lock mass. Prior to analysis, the Q-TOF was calibrated to ±0.005 Da (+ESI) using a solution of sodium trifluoroacetate. Expression of SCT in Yeast and Purification of SCT from Yeast Medium—The Carlsberg yeast strain W2579 was generated to synthesize large amounts of CPY and secrete the protein to the medium (22Nielsen T.L. Holmberg S. Petersen J.G.L. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1990; 33: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To determine whether this yeast strain could be used to express and secrete SCT, cultures of cells harboring pYES2 and pYES2-SCT were grown to stationary phase and then induced to produce protein by the addition of galactose. Cell extracts and the medium supernatant were then assayed by HPLC for SCT activity. No SCT activity was detected in either the cells or supernatant fractions of cultures harboring pYES2. In cultures carrying pYES2-SCT, SCT activity was readily detected in the medium (Fig. 2), and only low levels (∼10% of the total) of SCT activity were recovered in the yeast cell lysate. In contrast, when pYES2-SCT was transferred into a yeast strain not defective in vacuolar targeting, SCT activity could only be found in yeast cell extracts (data not shown). These data demonstrate that like CPY, SCT is secreted in prc1/vpl1 yeast. In order to conduct a detailed characterization of SCT, the protein was partially purified from the medium with an overall yield of 3.8% and a 12-fold increase in specific activity (Table I). After precipitation with ammonium sulfate, the protein was dialyzed and then heat-treated to denature temperature-sensitive proteins. SCT has been reported previously to be a heat-stable enzyme (20Gräwe W. Strack D. Z. Naturforsch. 1986; 41: 28-33Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and the yeast-expressed protein was similarly stable at 60 °C for at least 1 h. Having found that SCT does not bind to ion exchange media at neutral pH (data not shown), the heat-treated preparation was passed through a Q-Sepharose fast flow column to remove all anionic protein species. Finally, because preliminary data indicated that SCT is a glycoprotein, the protein was further purified using concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B. In assays of the final enzyme fraction, SCT activity was linear for at least 60 min over a wide range of protein concentrations and was stable at -20 °Cinthe presence of 20% glycerol for several months without loss of activity (data not shown).Table IPurification of SCT from S. cerevisiae vpl1 mutant mediumStepTotal proteinActivitySpecific activityYieldPurificationmgpkatalpkatal mg-1%-foldMedium348.9 × 1032.6 × 102100150-70% ammonium sulfate precipitate131.6 × 1031.2 × 102180.48Heated dialysate111.4 × 1031.3 × 102160.51Q-Sepharose flow-through1.51.5 × 1031.0 × 103173.9Concanavalin A column eluent0.123.4 × 1023.0 × 1033.812 Open table in a new tab Kinetic Analysis of SCT Activity—Unlike other methods previously used for the measurement of SCT activity (21Vogt T. Aebershold R. Ellis B Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 622-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), the HPLC method used in this study enabled the simultaneous detection of sinapoylcholine and any other sinapoylglucose-derived products, including sinapic acid, a potential spontaneous or enzyme-catalyzed hydrolytic product. Indeed, initial experiments demonstrated the enzyme-catalyzed formation of a compound that co-chromatographed with sinapic acid in SCT assays conducted at non-saturating choline concentrations, suggesting that SCT can function as an esterase. Surprisingly, LC-MS analysis of the product (accurate mass of [M-H]-= 297.1038 ± 0.010) indicated that the compound was sinapoylglycerol, not sinapic acid, suggesting that SCT can use the glycerol found in the SCT assay buffer as a sinapate acceptor. To test this hypothesis, SCT was desalted into MOPS, with and without glycerol, and was used in conventional SCT assays. In these experiments, the production of the putative sinapoylglycerol was dependent upon the presence of glycerol in the buffer, providing conclusive evidence that SCT can use glycerol as a sinapate acceptor (data not shown). In order to avoid this side reaction in future assays, a new protein preparation was made and exchanged into MOPS buffer without glycerol as the final step in purification. Unfortunately, in the absence of glycerol, SCT was completely inactivated during the overnight dialysis step; therefore, all further protein preparations were stored in buffer containing 20% glycerol and desalted into buffer without glycerol just prior to kinetic analysis. Under these conditions, no spontaneous or enzyme-catalyzed sinapoylglucose esterase or sinapoylcholine esterase activity was detectable under standard assay conditions (data not shown). In addition to the unexpected sinapoylglycerol product, it was noted that a novel SCT-dependent peak with a retention time 2 min less than sinapoylcholine was observed in SCT assays conducted during purification of the protein using Tris buffer. In contrast, when protein was desalted into phosphate buffer prior to assay, this novel peak was not present (data not shown). LC-MS analysis of the product (accurate mass of [M + H]+ 328.1396 ± 0.005) confirmed that it was sinapoyl-2-amino-2-hydroxymethyl-1,3-propanediol. Based upon these results, 2-amino-2-hydroxymethyl-1,3-propanediol (Tris) was analyzed as a sinapate acceptor and was found to demonstrate Michaelis-Menten kinetics with regard to transesterification (Table II). Following the identification of this activity, SCT was routinely exchanged into MOPS buffer as a final step in purification to avoid background activity against Tris.Table IIKinetic constants for SCT assayed with various sinapate donors and acceptorsSubstrateKmappVmaxappVmaxapp/KmappmMpkatal mg-1pkatal mg-1 mM-1Hydroxycinnamate donors (100 mM choline)Sinapoylglucose0.162.8 × 1031.7 × 104Feruloylglucose0.411.8 × 1034.3 × 103Caffeoylglucose0.107.5 × 1027.3 × 103p-Coumaroylglucose1.93.3 × 1031.8 × 103Sinapate acceptors (1 mM sinapoylglucose)Choline3.22.5 × 103780N,N-Dimethylethanolamine191.7 × 103892-Methylaminoethanol2451.2 × 1035EthanolamineNDaND, not determined.NDaND, not determined.NDaND, not determined.Neopentyl alcohol254.5 × 10218Tris1053.2 × 1023a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab To examine the in vitro kinetics of SCT with regard to its natural in vivo substrates, the conversion of sinapoylglucose to sinapoylcholine in the presence of choline was assayed by HPLC. As reported previously (5Shirley A.M. McMichael C.M. Chapple C. Plant J. 2001; 28: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the reaction catalyzed by SCT was observed to proceed spontaneously at a readily measurable rate in the absence of protein; therefore, all assay results were corrected for spontaneously produced sinapoylcholine. When assayed in the presence of 100 mm choline, semi-purified SCT appeared to demonstrate Michaelis-Menten kinetics with regard to sinapoylcholine transesterification with an apparent Km of 160 μm for sinapoylglucose and an apparent Vmax of 2.8 × 103 picokatals mg-1 (Fig. 3A). SCT also demonstrated Michaelis-Menten kinetics with regard to sinapoylcholine transesterification in the presence of 1 mm sinapoylglucose with an apparent Km of 3.2 mm for choline and an apparent Vmax of 2.5 × 103 picokatals mg-1 (Fig. 3B). In order to investigate the determinants for substrate binding, the substrate specificity of SCT was analyzed with a variety of hydroxycinnamoylglucose esters and potential sinapate acceptors. In assays containing each of the hydroxycinnamoylglucose esters, a novel peak was identified by HPLC, and the identity of each product was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectroscopy (feruloylcholine M = 280.054; caffeoylcholine M = 266.017; p-coumaroylcholine M = 250.17). All of the hydroxycinnamoylglucose esters assayed demonstrated similar kinetics with regard to transesterification (Table II). Although the apparent Km value for caffeoylglucose was lower than the apparent Km value for sinapoylglucose, the apparent Vmax value for caffeoylglucose was ∼3-fold less than the apparent Vmax value for sinapoylglucose. Conversely, the apparent Km value for p-coumaroylglucose was 10-fold higher than the apparent Km value for sinapoylglucose, but the apparent Vmax value for p-coumaroylglucose was greater than the apparent Vmax value for sinapoylglucose. As a result, the Vmax/Km values for each substrate were similar. In contrast, analysis of the substrate specificity of SCT for the sinapate acceptor indicated a clear specificity for choline (Table II). In assays containing each of the sinapate acceptors analyzed, a novel peak was identified by HPLC, and the identity of each product was confirmed by LC-MS (sinapoyl-N,N-dimethylethanolamine, accurate mass of [M + H]+ 296.1463 ± 0.005; sinapoyl-2-methylaminoethanol, accurate mass of [M + H]+ 282.1378 ± 0.005). All of the sinapate acceptors assayed, except for ethanolamine, demonstrated Michaelis-Menten kinetics with regard to transesterification (Table II). For ethanolamine, a novel peak dependent upon the presence of ethanolamine was present in the HPLC chromatograms; however, the rate of product formation in the reactions was insufficient for d"

In this study, we have characterized the DNA-binding and transcriptional properties of the bHLH factor mSharp-1/DEC2. mSharp-1 belongs to the Hairy/Enhancer of Split subfamily of bHLH factors and exhibits the highest structural and sequence identity with Stra13. We show that mSharp-1 specifically binds to the E box motif (CANNTG) as a homodimer and acts as a potent transcriptional repressor of MyoD- and E12-induced E box activity and differentiation. The inhibitory activity of mSharp-1 occurs through several mechanisms including occupancy of E box sites by mSharp-1 homodimers and by direct physical interaction with MyoD and E proteins. Furthermore, by using gel mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, we have identified Stra13 as a target for mSharp-1-mediated repression. We demonstrate that transcriptional repression of Stra13 depends, in part, on binding of mSharp-1 to three conserved E box motifs in the Stra13 proximal promoter. Moreover, mSharp-1 directly interacts with the transcriptional activator Sp1 and impairs Sp1 induction of Stra13 promoter. Our results suggest that mSharp-1 functions as a transcriptional repressor by DNA binding dependent and independent mechanisms.

The common structures shared among the members of this superfamily are the basic domain, which is required for DNA binding, and the helix-loop-helix domain, which is involved in dimerization (3Murre C.

Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 788-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Based on the dimerization properties, tissue distribution, and the transcriptional activities, bHLH proteins can be categorized into three classes (5Fisher A. Caudy M. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Class A bHLH factors contain the mammalian “E” proteins, which include the two E2A gene products E12 and E47 as well as E2-2 and HEB. E proteins are ubiquitously expressed and can form homodimers or heterodimers with bHLH factors of the same class as well as with other classes. Class B bHLH proteins tend to be expressed in a tissue or cell type-specific manner and function as heterodimers with the class A bHLH factors. bHLH factors involved in tissue-specific differentiation generally belong to the class B subfamily and include the myogenic factors MyoD and myogenin, the neurogenic factors Mash1, NeuroD, and neurogenins, as well as the bHLH proteins SCL/TAL which are important for hematopoiesis (6Olson E.N.

Nature. 1995; 373: 432-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Both class A and class B bHLH factors bind to a common DNA sequence called the E box (CANNTG) commonly found in the promoter or enhancer regions of numerous developmentally regulated genes (15Murre C.

Science. 2000; 287: 1820-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). All members contain a characteristic motif called the orange domain and are distinctive in their function as transcriptional repressors. Some members of this subfamily are expressed ubiquitously, whereas others are tissue-restricted. Functional analysis by gene disruption studies has revealed novel roles for some of these genes in the development of brain and eye as well as in the differentiation and activation of T cells (10Kageyama R. Nakanishi S. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1997; 7: 659-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 24Kageyama R. Ohtsuka T. Tomita K. Mol.

The DNA-binding properties of this subfamily are quite divergent. Whereas Hairy/[E(Spl)]/Hes1 bind the N box sequence (27Takebayashi K. Sasai Y. Sakai Y. Watanabe T. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5150-5156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is a variant of the canonical E box sequence motif, some Hes proteins as well as a few members of the HRT/Hey/CHF/Gridlock subgroup bind the E box. The C class bHLH factor Sharp-1, which was first cloned from adult rat brain (18Rossner M.J. Dorr J. Gass P. Schwab M.H. Nave K. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 460-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), is more closely related to Stra13 than to the remaining family members. Both Stra13 and Sharp-1 lack the WRPW motif for recruitment of the co-repressor Groucho and function as transcriptional repressors through both histone deacetylase (HDAC)-dependent and -independent mechanisms (28Sun H. Taneja R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4058-4063Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 29Garriga-Canut M. Roopra A. Buckley N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14821-14828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The high degree of sequence conservation within the bHLH domain and the related mechanisms of transcriptional repression suggest that Stra13 and mSharp-1 possess unique functions and repress similar downstream regulatory targets. Sharp-1 is expressed during mouse embryonic development in tissues overlapping with Stra13 suggesting a cross-regulatory interaction between these two genes (30Azmi S. Taneja R. Mech. Dev. 2002; 114: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We have previously characterized the transcriptional and functional properties of Stra13 (16Boudjelal M. Taneja R. Matsubara S. Bouillet P. Dolle P. Chambon P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2052-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 26Sun H. Lu B. Li R.Q. Flavell R.A. Taneja R. Nat.

A. 2000; 97: 4058-4063Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), but the DNA-binding and transcriptional properties of Sharp-1 within the bHLH regulatory network have not been characterized and its biological targets not defined. To better understand the molecular basis of Sharp-1 function, we have undertaken the analysis of Sharp-1 activity. We report here the cloning of the mouse Sharp-1 (mSharp-1) cDNA and characterization of its transcriptional activity. We demonstrate that mSharp-1 represses transcriptional activation of E box containing synthetic and natural promoters. mSharp-1 binds to the E box motif as a homodimer and can repress E12/MyoD-mediated transcriptional activation and myogenic differentiation. mSharp-1-mediated repression of E box activity occurs via several mechanisms including competition for DNA-binding and protein-protein interactions with MyoD and E47. Moreover, by using gel mobility shift experiments and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we also demonstrate both in vitro and in vivo that mSharp-1 negatively regulates Stra13 expression. Transcriptional repression of Stra13 expression depends, in part, on binding of mSharp-1 to three E box sites in the proximal promoter, as well as by direct interaction with the transactivator Sp1 resulting in inhibition of Sp1 activity and Stra13 expression. Our observations indicate that mSharp-1 functions as a repressor both by E box-binding dependent and non-DNA-binding dependent mechanisms. Taken together, our results provide a mechanistic basis for mSharp-1 function in the bHLH regulatory network and identify it as a regulator of Stra13 expression. Isolation of mSharp-1 cDNA—mSharp-1 was isolated from a mouse embryo E11 5′-Stretch Plus cDNA library (Clontech) using the rat Sharp-1 cDNA as a probe. Approximately 5 × 105 plaques were plated, transferred to Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and prehybridized in a solution containing 50% formamide, 5× SSPE, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 0.05 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA for 3–5 h at 42 °C. The rat Sharp-1 cDNA was used as a probe. Hybridization was carried out at 42 °C for 16 h in the same buffer containing 32P-labeled probe. Filters were washed 4 times at 65 °C with 2× SSC + 0.1% SDS. Four phage clones that were positive after two rounds of screening were subcloned into pTZ18R in the EcoRI site and sequenced on both strands. All the clones obtained from library screening were partial and lacked the 5′ end of the cDNA including the translation start site. One of these clones, which contained the longest coding sequence, was used to further clone full-length mouse Sharp-1 cDNA. A PstI-EcoRI fragment from this clone was subcloned in pTZ18R. A BLAST sequence similarity search of GenBank™ EST data base with rat Sharp-1 resulted in the identification of several mouse ESTs. One EST (accession number BE985179), which contained the 5′-untranslated region and coding sequences for the N-terminal region, was restricted with EcoRI and PstI to release a fragment of about 600 bp. This fragment was ligated to the EcoRI-PstI partial cDNA clone obtained from the library screening to obtain the full-length mouse Sharp-1 cDNA. The complete nucleotide sequence was determined on both strands. Generation of Anti-mSharp-1 Antibody—Polyclonal anti-mSharp-1 antibody was raised against a C-terminal peptide (Sigma GenoSys). The serum was tested for antigenicity by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with coated synthetic peptide according to the manufacturer's protocol and purified by caprylic acid and ammonium sulfate precipitation. The serum was tested for specificity by Western blot using in vitro translated mSharp-1 and Stra13, and positive reactivity was obtained with mSharp-1 only. GST Pull-down Assay—GST pull-down assays were done as described (28Sun H. Taneja R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4058-4063Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads containing 4 μgof GST-mSharp-1 protein was incubated with 5 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled E47 or MyoD translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate using the TnT coupled in vitro transcription-translation system (Promega). The samples were incubated in a total volume of 200 μl of GST binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.3 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) and complete proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) for 3 h at 4 °C, followed by three washes with the same buffer. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling for 10 min in sample buffer, separated on 12% SDS-PAGE gels, and visualized by autoradiography. RNA Extraction and RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from various organs of 8-week-old mice with Trizol (Invitrogen). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed as described previously (16Boudjelal M. Taneja R. Matsubara S. Bouillet P. Dolle P. Chambon P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2052-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). A 280-bp mSharp-1 fragment was amplified using primers RT8 (5′-AGGCACTCTAACTGGTTCCG-3′) and RT9 (5′-AGAGTAAGAGATGCTCTGCT-3′). The amounts of RNA were normalized to the ubiquitous 36B4 transcripts (31Krowczynska A.M. Coutts M. Makrides S. Brawerman G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6408Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) with primers RT6 (5′-CAGCTCTGGAGAAACTGCTG-3′) and RT7 (5′-GTGTACTCAGTCTCCACAGA-3′). RT-PCR products were detected by Southern blot analysis with 32P-labeled mSharp-1 and 36B4 cDNA probes. Plasmid Constructs—Plasmid p355, which contains the full-length mSharp-1 cloned in pTZ18R in the EcoRI site, was used for in vitro translation. An mSharp-1 expression vector p359 was constructed by subcloning the insert from p355 in the EcoRI site of mammalian expression vector pCS2. To generate GST-Sharp-1 fusion construct, a BamHI restriction site was introduced by PCR in plasmid p421, which contains the Sharp-1 EST BE985179 subcloned in KS+. The insert was released with BamHI and introduced in the same site of pGEX-2TK (Amersham Biosciences) to generate plasmid p422. Plasmid p440 containing the entire GST-Sharp-1 construct was generated by a triple ligation using the BamHI-SphI fragment from p422 and the SphI-EcoRI fragment from p359 cloned into the BamHI-EcoRI sites of pGEX-2TK. The Stra13 expression vector pCS2-Stra13 and the Stra13 promoter construct pGL3PmN have been previously described (28Sun H. Taneja R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4058-4063Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—EMSA using in vitro translated mSharp-1 was performed as described (32Dhar M. Taneja R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4750-4756Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The sequence of the top strand of the probe (E box is underlined) was 5′-GGCCGCAGCACGTGGCACAGCACGTGGCACAGCACGTGGCAGC-3′. A typical binding reaction contained 20,000 cpm probe, 5 μl of in vitro translated protein or 5 μg of nuclear extract, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 20 min and fractionated on 5% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 × TBE buffer. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. For competition experiments, 200- or 400-fold excess of competitor DNA (Table I) was added to the reaction on ice for 20 min prior to addition of the labeled probe. Antibody supershift assays included incubation of the binding components with 2 μl of anti-mSharp-1 antibody for 10 min at room temperature prior to addition of the labeled probe.Table IDouble-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides used as probes in electrophoretic mobility shift assays Open table in a new tab Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutations in the E box sequence of the Stra13 promoter construct pGL3PmN were introduced using the Quick-change Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).

Empty expression vectors were added to normalize the amount of DNA in each well. Cells were harvested with passive lysis buffer, and luciferase assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). Transfection efficiencies were normalized by co-transfecting 50 ng of the β-galactosidase plasmid pCH110 (Amersham Biosciences). All transfections were performed in duplicate at least three times. Myogenic Differentiation Assays—10T1/2 cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates 1 day prior to transfection. Cells were transfected as described above with 2 μg of MyoD in the presence or absence of mSharp-1. After 5 days in differentiation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% horse serum), cells were rinsed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and then fixed in methanol for 20 min at 4 °C. Following a 30-min blocking step (5% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline), the plates were incubated with 1:400 dilution of MY-32, a monoclonal anti-skeletal myosin antibody (Sigma) specific for the myosin heavy chain, overnight at 4 °C. The primary complexes were detected using a biotinylated anti-mouse antibody and a horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin conjugate (Vector Laboratories). Nuclear Extracts—10T1/2 cells (2 × 106) cultured on 100-mm culture dishes were transfected with 5 μg each of MyoD and E47 for 48 h, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 400 μl of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After incubation on ice for 5 min, Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 0.6%. Nuclei were pelleted, and the cytoplasmic proteins were carefully removed. Nuclei were then resuspended in buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After vortexing and stirring for 30 min at 4 °C, the samples were centrifuged, and nuclear proteins in the supernatant were transferred to a fresh vial. Protein concentrations of nuclear extracts were determined by Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP assays were done essentially as described (Upstate Biotechnology Protocols). For analysis of endogenous mSharp-1 binding to the E box sites in the Stra13 promoter, proliferating C2C12 (∼30 × 106) cells were grown on 10-cm dishes, and the proteins bound to DNA were cross-linked by addition of formaldehyde (final 1%) to the culture medium. Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1). The lysate was sonicated to shear DNA to lengths between 200 and 1000 bp. The sonicated supernatant was diluted 10-fold with ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl). An equivalent of 107 cells was incubated with 10 μl of anti-mSharp-1 antibody or with 10 μl of preimmune serum overnight at 4 °C. DNA-mSharp-1 antibody complexes were collected by addition of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose slurry. Samples were incubated 1 h at 4 °C, and the agarose complex was pelleted by brief centrifugation at 4 °C. After extensive washing, the pellet was dissolved in 250 μl of elution buffer and spun to remove the agarose. The supernatant was treated with 250 μl of 5 m NaCl and heated at 65 °C for 4 h to reverse protein-DNA cross-links. After treatment with EDTA and proteinase K, the supernatant was extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol to recover DNA. Eluted DNA was resuspended in 30 μl of TE. For PCR, 2 μl of DNA was amplified using primers RT31 (5′-TCTCATTCACTTGGCTCGCA-3′) and RT46 (5′-ATGTTCCTATGAGCTAGCCTGAGCTTCC-3′) that span the E box sites 1 and 2 in the Stra13 promoter. Thirty cycles of PCR were performed, and the amplified products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel. To investigate Sp1 and mSharp-1 interaction on the mutant Stra13 promoter, 10T1/2 cells were transfected with 8 μg of the triple E box mutant construct [E boxM(1 + 2 + 3)] using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). 48 h after transfection, cells were cross-linked and incubated with 10 μl of anti-mSharp-1 or 2 μl of anti-Sp1 antibody (PEP2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as described above. The protein A-antibody-histone-DNA complex was then used for both immunoprecipitation and PCR. For immunoprecipitation with Sp1, proteins bound to protein A-agarose were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer and resolved on a 9% SDS-PAGE gel. Immunoblotting was performed with mSharp-1 antibody. Proteins were detected using the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). For PCRs, DNA was eluted as described above and was amplified using a 5′ primer from pGL3 (RT145 (5′-CTAGCAAAATAGGCTGTCCC-3′)) and a 3′ primer corresponding to the mutant E box2 site (RT40 (5′-TGCGAGCACAGGTAAGAGA-3′)) that allowed for specific amplification of the exogenously transfected DNA. Thirty cycles of PCR were performed, and the amplified products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel. Immunoprecipitation of in Vitro Translated mSharp-1 Protein with Sp1 Antibody—[35S]Met-labeled mSharp-1 protein was generated using the TnT coupled transcription-translation system (Promega). For immunoprecipitation, lysates were incubated with 2 μg of rabbit polyclonal Sp1 antibody (PEP2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in 1:1 mix of two buffers (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 420 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA) and (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol) for 1 h on a rotating wheel at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were absorbed to protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C and washed three times in the buffer described above. Associated proteins were then eluted in SDS sample buffer containing dithiothreitol by boiling for 5 min and loaded on a 12% polyacrylamide gel. Gel was fixed and dried before detection of 35S-labeled mSharp-1 by autoradiography. cDNA Cloning and Expression Analysis of mSharp-1—To understand the biological properties of Sharp-1 and to determine the molecular basis of its function, we screened an E11 mouse embryonic cDNA library using the rat Sharp-1 cDNA as a probe in an effort to clone the mouse homologue of Sharp-1. Sequence analysis indicated that the cDNA contains a single open reading frame encoding a 410-amino acid polypeptide (Fig. 1A). The amino acid sequence is identical to the recently reported mouse DEC2 (GenBank™ accession number AB044090) but contains a longer 3′-untranslated region (33Fujimoto K. Shen M. Noshiro M. Matsubara K. Shingu S. Honda K. Yoshida E. Suardita K. Matsuda Y. Kato Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Domain analysis (Fig. 1B) indicated that mSharp-1 contains a bHLH motif located in the N terminus and an orange domain which is a characteristic feature seen in all repressive bHLH factors such as Hairy/E(Spl)/Hes/Stra13. Similar to Stra13, mSharp-1 also contains a proline residue in the basic region and lacks the WRPW motif. mSharp-1 and Stra13 share the highest homology within bHLH domain (96%) and an overall homology of 50% over the entire length of the two proteins. To analyze the temporal pattern of mSharp-1 expression, we performed RT-PCR using total RNA from embryos between E9.5 and E16.5 as well as various tissues from adult mice (Fig. 1C). Consistent with our previous report, mSharp-1 expression was detected at all embryonic stages tested (30Azmi S. Taneja R. Mech. Dev. 2002; 114: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A high level of expression was also seen in a number of tissues including thymus, skeletal muscle, brain, stomach, uterus, and pancreas. Heart, spleen, lung, kidney, and eye exhibited intermediate levels of expression, whereas the lowest levels were seen in liver and in small intestine. mSharp-1 Binds to the E Box and Mediates Transcriptional Repression of E Box Activity—Most bHLH proteins are thought to function as transcription factors by binding to either E box motif (CANNTG) or N box motif (CACNAG). To investigate the transcriptional properties of mSharp-1, we tested whether mSharp-1 can bind to either the E box or the N box sequences in vitro. EMSAs were performed using 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes containing three E box sequences or containing the N box sequence. Addition of in vitro translated mSharp-1 to the E box oligonucleotide resulted in a DNA-protein complex (Fig. 2A, lane 1). In contrast, mSharp-1 did not exhibit any detectable binding to an oligonucleotide harboring the N box, whereas Hes1, which is known to bind the N box sequence, clearly bound to and was supershifted using an anti-Hes antibody (data not shown). To assess further the specificity of mSharp-1 binding to the E box, we generated polyclonal antibodies specific to mSharp-1. Addition of anti-mSharp-1 antibody to the binding reaction resulted in a supershift of the complex (Fig. 2A, lane 2). In addition, mSharp-1 binding was competed with a 200-fold excess of an unlabeled oligonucleotide containing E boxes (Fig. 2A, lane 4). Taken together, these results demonstrate that mSharp-1 specifically binds to E box site likely as a homodimer. We then tested whether binding of mSharp-1 to the E box resulted in transcriptional activation or repression of a synthetic E box reporter. Transient transfection experiments were performed in 10T1/2 cells using the 4R-tk-luc reporter that contains four tandem E boxes from the muscle creatine kinase (MCK) enhancer upstream of the thymidine kinase basal promoter (34Weintraub H.

https://openalex.org/W2087663711,"Vinexin is a recently identified cytoskeletal protein and plays a key role in the regulation of cytoskeletal organization and signal transduction. Vinexin localizes at sites of cell-extracellular matrix adhesion in NIH3T3 fibroblasts and at sites of cell-cell contact in epithelial LLC-PK1 cells. Expression of vinexin promotes the formation of actin stress fiber, but the role of vinexin at sites of cell-cell contact is unclear. Here we identified lp-dlg/KIAA0583 as a novel binding partner for vinexin by using yeast two-hybrid screening. lp-dlg/KIAA0583 has a NH2-terminal coiled-coil-like domain, in addition to four PDZ domains, an Src homology (SH) 3 domain, and a guanylate kinase domain, which are conserved structures in membrane-associated guanylate kinase family proteins. The third SH3 domain of vinexin bound to the region between the second and third PDZ domain of lp-dlg, which contains a proline-rich sequence. lp-dlg colocalized with vinexin at sites of cell-cell contact in LLC-PK1 cells. Furthermore, lp-dlg colocalized with beta-catenin, a major adherens junction protein, in LLC-PK1 cells. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that both endogenous and epitope-tagged deletion mutants of lp-dlg/KIAA0583 associated with beta-catenin. We also showed that these three proteins could form a ternary complex. Together these findings suggest that lp-dlg/KIAA0583 is a novel scaffolding protein that can link the vinexin-vinculin complex and beta-catenin at sites of cell-cell contact."
https://openalex.org/W2095374317,"The assembly and secretion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in vertebrates requires apolipoprotein B (apoB) and the endoplasmic reticulum-localized cofactor, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP). Invertebrates, particularly insects, transport the majority of their neutral and polar lipids in lipophorins; however, the assembly of lipophorin precursor particles was presumed to be MTP-independent. A Drosophila melanogaster expressed gene sequence (CG9342), displaying 23% identity with human MTP, was recently identified. When coexpressed in COS cells, CG9342 promoted the assembly and secretion of apoB34 and apoB41 (N-terminal 34 and 41% of human apoB). The apoB34-containing particles assembled by human MTP and CG9342 displayed similar peak densities of ∼1.169 g/ml and similar lipid compositions. However, CG9342 displayed differential sensitivities to two inhibitors of human MTP and low vesicle-based lipid transfer activity, in vitro. In addition, important predicted structural distinctions exist between the human and Drosophila proteins suggesting overlapping but not identical functional roles. We conclude that CG9342 and human MTP are orthologs that share only a subset of functions, consistent with known differences in intracellular and extracellular aspects of vertebrate and invertebrate lipid transport and metabolism.

Processes responsible for the efficient capture, transport, and storage of lipids are observed in all multicellular organisms.

Atherosclerosis. 2000; 148: 1-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The liver is the second major site of apoB expression where it assembles endogenous lipids to form triglyceride (TG)-rich very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) (2Davidson N.O. Shelness G.S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 169-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Both chylomicrons and VLDL function to distribute TG to peripheral tissues; however, metabolic products of these particles can accumulate in plasma and contribute to several chronic disease states, including atherosclerosis and diabetes (3Goldstein J.L.

The discovery of MTP as a critical cofactor essential for chylomicron and VLDL formation has provided considerable mechanistic insight into the processes responsible for intracellular lipoprotein assembly (5Wetterau J.R. Lin M.C.M. Jamil H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Lipids Lipid Metab. 1997; 1345: 136-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 6Gordon D.A. Jamil H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Mol. Cell. Biol.

Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 22-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). However, many aspects of this pathway remain elusive. An important clue for understanding lipoprotein assembly is the notion, first introduced in 1988, that apoB is a distant relative of vitellogenin (8Baker M.E. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 1057-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It was subsequently noted that MTP is also a member of this gene family (9Shoulders C.C. Narcisi T.M.E. Read J. Chester S.A. Brett D.J. Anderson T.A. Levitt D.G. Banaszak L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 285-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and that the greatest similarity among vitellogenin, apoB, and MTP is concentrated within their amino-terminal ∼750–1000 amino acids (10Mann C.J. Anderson T.A. Read J. Chester S.A. Harrison G.B. Köchl S. Ritchie P.J. Bradbury P. Hussain F.S. Amey J. Vanloo B. Rosseneu M. Infante R. Hancock J.M. Levitt D.G. Banaszak L.J. Scott J.

Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1401-1416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vitellogenin is an ancient lipid-binding protein that functions in the transport of lipids and other nutrients (13Ohlendorf D.H. Barbarsh G.R. Trout A Kent C. Banaszak L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7992-8001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from liver or fat body to the developing oocyte of oviparous vertebrates and invertebrates (14Wahli W.

Biol. 1989; 53: 33-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Another form of primitive lipoprotein biogenesis is the assembly of apolipophorin II/I (apoLp-II/I) into high density lipophorin (HDLp) particles (16Canavoso L.E. Jouni Z.E. Karnas K.J. Pennington J.E. Wells M.A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2001; 21: 23-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 17Weers P.M.M. Van der Horst D.J. Van Marrewijk W.J.A. Van den Eijnden M.V. Van Doorn J.M. Beenakkers A.M.T. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 485-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike apoB-containing particles, whose initial formation and ongoing enlargement occurs exclusively within the secretory pathway, maturation of HDLp is a post secretory event that is achieved by efflux of diglycerides from insect fat body to the HDLp acceptor. The mature lipophorin, termed low density lipophorin, is then delivered to flight muscle where its lipid is discharged and used as an energy source. Although apoLp-II/I is also a homolog of apoB (18Babin P.J. Bogerd J. Kooiman F.P. Van Marrewijk W.J.A. Van der Horst D.J. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 49: 150-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), the fat body cell-dependent assembly of HDLp, and primitive lipoprotein assembly in general, were presumed to be MTP-independent (16Canavoso L.E.

When the Drosophila data base was searched for sequences similar to human MTP a single gene, CG9342, was identified. Given its 23% identity with human MTP, this gene product was initially described as a triglyceride-binding protein (22Stapleton M. Liao G. Brokstein P. Hong L. Carninci P. Shiraki T. Hayashizaki Y. Champe M. Pacleb J. Wan K. Yu C. Carlson J. George R. Celniker S. Rubin G.M. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 1294-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In this report we functionally characterized CG9342 and observed that, in transfected cells, it supports the assembly and secretion of human apoB34 and apoB41 as lipoprotein precursors. In addition, we observed functional and structural differences between CG9342 and human MTP, possibly reflecting known differences in intracellular and extracellular aspects of vertebrate and invertebrate lipid transport and metabolism. The identification of invertebrate orthologs of human MTP may enable structural and functional dissection of the multiple roles of human MTP in apoB assembly as well as apoB-independent effects on intracellular lipid trafficking (23Wang Y.

Density Gradient Centrifugation—Density analysis of apoB34H-containing lipoprotein particles from human MTP- or CG9342-transfected cells was performed as described (29Sellers J.A. Shelness G.S. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1897-1904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After centrifugation, twelve 1-ml samples were collected and concentrated to ∼50 μl using Centricon 30 centrifugal concentrators (Millipore). Samples were diluted with 1 ml of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 300 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm PMSF) and subjected to immunoprecipitation. Samples were then analyzed by 6% SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Each gradient is representative of media collected from one 150-mm dish of transfected cells. Oleate Labeling and Affinity Purification of ApoB34H-containing Lipoproteins—COS-1 cells in 150-mm dishes were transfected with 10 μg of apoB34H and 5 μg of either human MTP or CG9342 by the DEAE-dextran method. Forty hours post-transfection, cells were washed twice with PBS. Radiolabeling was performed in a 4:1 mixture of Met/Cys-deficient DMEM and complete DMEM containing 0.5% fatty acid free bovine serum albumin (Sigma), 10 μCi/ml [3H]oleate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 20 μCi/ml [35S]Met/Cys. After labeling for 24 h, media was clarified by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min and adjusted to 150 mm NaCl (final NaCl concentration, ∼300 mm), 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm PMSF. ApoB34H was then affinity-purified from media by addition of a 375-μl bed volume of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) and incubation for 90 min at 4 °C with inversion. The suspension was passed through a 15-ml polypropylene disposable column (Bio-Rad), and the column was washed twice with 15 ml of wash buffer I (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, and 5 mm imidazole, pH 8.0) and twice with 15 ml of wash buffer II (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0). The column was eluted three times with 0.75 ml of elution buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). Eluted fractions were then pooled and concentrated to ∼100 μl using a Centricon-30 centrifugal concentrator. Ten percent of each eluted fraction was reserved for analysis by SDS-PAGE and fluorography to verify protein purity. Lipid Composition of Affinity Purified Lipoproteins—Lipids were extracted from affinity-purified lipoproteins by the method of Bligh and Dyer (35Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42878) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were adjusted to 0.5 ml with PBS followed by addition of 1.88 ml of chloroform:methanol (1:2, v/v). Ten microliters of a mixture of 5 mg/ml egg yolk lecithin, triolein, dioleoyl glycerol, and cholesteryl oleate (in chloroform) and 0.626 ml of chloroform was added, followed by brief vortexing. Samples were acidified by addition of 0.626 ml of 0.05% concentrated sulfuric acid, again followed by brief vortexing. After centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 10 min at room temperature, the upper phase was removed by aspiration and the lower phase was dried at 45 °C under a stream of nitrogen. The sides of the tube were rinsed with 200 μl of chloroform and again dried. Samples were redissolved in 50 μl of chloroform and applied to a polyester-backed silica gel TLC plate (Whatman, PE SIL G). Plates were developed first in a polar solvent of chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:water (65:45:12:6, v/v), by running the solvent front ∼1/3 up the length of the plate. After air drying, plates were developed in a neutral solvent tank containing hexane:ether:acetic acid (80:20:1, v/v). Lipid standards were visualized by incubation in iodine vapor, and areas containing phosphatidylcholine, diacylglycerol, triacylglycerol, and cholesteryl ester were cut and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Control experiments, in which the entire length of the TLC plate was cut and counted, revealed that these were the only radiolabeled lipid species present above background. Alignment of CG9342 with Vertebrate MTPs—The deduced amino acid sequence of CG9342 was compared with human and Fugu MTP (Fig. 1). The human and lower vertebrate (Fugu) sequences shared 55% identity/72% similarity over a 882-amino acid alignment, with one gaped region. The Drosophila sequence displayed 23% identity/42% similarity with human MTP and 22% identity/41% similarity with Fugu MTP, each over a 902-amino acid alignment containing 22 gapped regions. Hence, the identity between higher and lower vertebrate MTP is substantial, suggesting analogous functional roles. However, the considerably lower identity between the insect and vertebrate sequences, coupled with different lipid transport mechanisms observed across these species (16Canavoso L.E. Jouni Z.E. Karnas K.J. Pennington J.E. Wells M.A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2001; 21: 23-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), makes the assignment of Drosophila CG9342 function difficult based on sequence comparison alone. CG9342 Induces the Secretion of ApoB—A functional hallmark of MTP is its capacity to induce the secretion of apoB (36Leiper J.M. Bayliss J.D. Pease R.J. Brett D.J. Scott J. Shoulders C.C. J. Biol.

To explore whether CG9342 encodes a functional MTP, it was transiently expressed along with human apoB34 in COS cells. ApoB34 is incapable of undergoing appreciable secretion into media (M) in the absence of MTP (Fig. 2, lane 2). Cotransfection with human MTP dramatically induced apoB34 secretion (lane 4). CG9342 also induced apoB34 secretion, although with slightly lower efficiency (lanes 6 and 8). Another hallmark of MTP is its capacity to interact physically with apoB (10Mann C.J. Anderson T.A.

As observed in immunoprecipitates of cell extracts (C), both human MTP (lane 3) and CG9342 (lanes 5 and 7) appear to coimmunoprecipitate with apoB34. It has been known for some time that human MTP migrates more rapidly during SDS-PAGE than predicted from its calculated molecular weight (5Wetterau J.R. Lin M.C.M. Jamil H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Lipids Lipid Metab. 1997; 1345: 136-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), which may explain the relatively slower migration of Drosophila CG9342. CG9342 Promotes the Secretion of ApoB34 as a Buoyant Lipoprotein Particle with a Density and Lipid Composition Similar to That Produced by Human MTP—To directly assess whether the Drosophila protein is capable of assembling apoB34 with lipid, apoB34 was cotransfected into COS cells with either human MTP or CG9342. After radiolabeling with [35S]Met/Cys, media was subjected to density gradient centrifugation and apoB was recovered by immunoprecipitation. ApoB34 displayed a relatively heterogeneous density distribution profile with a peak of ∼1.169 g/ml (Fig. 3). This value is in agreement with density values obtained by others in stably transfected McA-RH7777 rat hepatoma cells (42Yao Z. Blackhart B.D. Linton M.F. Taylor S.M. Young S.G. McCarthy B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3300-3308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The composition of lipids associated with apoB34 was explored by radiolabeling transfected cells with [3H]oleate. After affinity purification of the apoB34-containing particles, lipids were separated by TLC and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. As observed in Fig. 4, the relative composition of [3H]oleate-labeled lipids associated with apoB34-containing particles secreted from COS cells cotransfected with either human MTP or Drosophila CG9342 was virtually identical.Fig. 4ApoB34-containing particles formed by human MTP or CG9342 display similar lipid compositions. COS-1 cells in 150-mm dishes were transfected by the DEAE-dextran method with apoB34H and either human MTP (hMTP, hatched bars) or CG9342 (unshaded bars). Forty hours after transfection, cells were labeled with [35S]Met/Cys and [3H]oleate for 24 h. ApoB34H was purified from media by nickel chromatography and [3H]oleate-labeled phosphatidylcholine (PC), diacylglycerol (DG), triacylglycerol (TG), and cholesteryl ester (CE) were quantified by TLC and liquid scintillation counting. The values from duplicate samples, each consisting of particles purified from two, 150-mm dishes, were used to calculate an average percent radiolabeled lipid composition for the apoB34-containing lipoproteins secreted by human MTP- and CG9342-cotransfected cells. Error bars, where visible, depict the data range.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) CG9342 and Human MTP Display Differential Susceptibilities to Chemical Inhibitors of Vertebrate MTP—To further explore whether the CG9342 gene product displays properties consistent with the behavior of vertebrate MTP, we tested its response to two well characterized MTP inhibitors. Cells were cotransfected with apoB41 or apoB6.6 and either AP, human MTP, or CG9342. ApoB41 was used in these studies because, unlike apoB34, which produces a very low level of background secretion (Fig. 2, lane 2), no detectable background secretion of apoB41 is observed in the absence of MTP (29Sellers J.A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 21951-21954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ApoB6.6, whose secretion is MTP-independent, served as a control for nonspecific effects of the inhibitors (29Sellers J.A. Shelness G.S. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1897-1904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were radiolabeled with [35S]Met/Cys in the presence of 0–20 μm BMS-200150 for 5 h (33Jamil H. Gordon D.A. Eustice D.C. Brooks C.M. Dickson Jr., J.K.

https://openalex.org/W2073714371,"Here we report that Yip1p and Yif1p, two members of an integral membrane protein complex that bind to the Rab Ypt1p, are required for membrane fusion with the Golgi in vitro. To block fusion, anti-Yip1p or anti-Yif1p antibodies must be added before vesicles bud from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These antibodies do not block the packaging of Yip1p, Yif1p, or the soluble NSF attachment protein receptor (SNAREs) into vesicles. We propose that Yip1p and Yif1p perform a critical role in establishing the fusion competence of ER to Golgi vesicles at the time of budding. Consistent with this proposal, we observe that the Yip1p·Yif1p complex binds to the ER to Golgi SNAREs Bos1p and Sec22p, two components of the membrane fusion machinery.

The specificity of membrane traffic through the secretory pathway is ensured by the machinery that mediates vesicle tethering, docking, and fusion. The molecular components required for these events are the tethers, Rabs and SNAREs (soluble NSF attachment protein receptor). 1The abbreviations used are: SNARE, soluble NSF attachment protein receptor; NSF, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein; GDI, GDP displacement inhibitor; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MBP, maltose binding protein; WT, wild type; PYC, permeabilized yeast cells; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; ConA, concanavalin A.1The abbreviations used are: SNARE, soluble NSF attachment protein receptor; NSF, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein; GDI, GDP displacement inhibitor; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MBP, maltose binding protein; WT, wild type; PYC, permeabilized yeast cells; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; ConA, concanavalin A. The tethers include multisubunit complexes and large coiled-coil proteins, whereas Rabs are key in regulating all tethering events. Tethering factors physically bind the correct carrier vesicle to its appropriate acceptor compartment. This occurs through specific interactions between components on the target membrane and the vesicle (1Whyte J.R. Munro S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2627-2637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Exactly how the SNAREs contribute to membrane fusion is the subject of an ongoing debate (2Mayer A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that purified SNARE proteins inserted into reconstituted liposomes can fulfill a minimal requirement for membrane fusion (3Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Gmachl M. Parlati F. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar). However, an open question is whether additional fusion machinery or regulatory factors may contribute to the accelerated fusion rates observed in vivo (4Bruns D. Jahn R. Pflügers Arch. 2002; 443: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).Another unanswered question is how the transition from vesicle tethering to membrane fusion takes place. It is thought that the activation of the Rab is pivotal to the initiation of the downstream docking event, commonly defined as trans-SNARE pairing, which is followed by membrane fusion (5Lian J.P. Stone S. Jiang Y. Lyons P. Ferro-Novick S. Nature. 1994; 372: 698-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 6Søgaard M. Tani K. Ye R.R. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Kirchhausen T. Rothman J.E. Söllner T. Cell. 1994; 78: 937-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Rab proteins belong to a family of small GTPases that regulate membrane traffic (7Novick P. Brennwald P. Cell. 1993; 75: 597-601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). In the cytosol, the GDP-bound form of the Rab is in a complex with guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI). Rabs are recruited to membranes with the aid of a GDI displacement factor (8Dirac-Svejstrup A.B. Sumizawa T. Pfeffer S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and inserted into the membrane via a prenyl group. Once the prenylated Rab is delivered to the membrane, it is activated by a specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor through the exchange of GDP for GTP (9Soldati T. Shapiro A.D. Svejstrup A.B. Pfeffer S.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 76-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 10Ullrich O. Horiuchi H. Bucci C. Zerial M. Nature. 1994; 368: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar).Membrane proteins that bind to prenylated Rab proteins have been identified and may provide a clue to the mechanism of Rab attachment to membranes. These factors, which include Yip1p, Yip2p (also called Yop1p), Yip3p, Yip4p, Yip5p, Yif1p, and their mammalian homologs, comprise a family of proteins defined by certain features (11Calero M. Winand N.J. Collins R.N. FEBS Lett. 2002; 515: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These include a common domain topology with a cytosolic N terminus, luminal C terminus, and multiple transmembrane-spanning domains. Furthermore, these proteins have been shown to interact with multiple Rabs and with each other (11Calero M. Winand N.J. Collins R.N. FEBS Lett. 2002; 515: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 12Matern H. Yang X. Andrulis E. Sternglanz R. Trepte H.H. Gallwitz D.

Yip1p and Yif1p are the only essential proteins in this family (14Winzeler E.A. Shoemaker D.D. Astromoff A. Liang H. Anderson K. Andre B. Bangham R. Benito R. Boeke J.D. Bussey H. Chu A.M.

Yip1p was first identified using the two-hybrid system as a protein that interacts preferentially with the GDP-bound form of Ypt1p and Ypt31p (13Yang X. Matern H.T. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4954-4963Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), two small GTP-binding proteins that act in ER-Golgi and intra-Golgi traffic, respectively (15Bacon R.A. Salminen A. Ruohola H.

Richardson C. Litt R. Segev N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Yif1p was later identified by its ability to interact with Yip1p in a two-hybrid screen (12Matern H. Yang X. Andrulis E. Sternglanz R. Trepte H.H. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4485-4492Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These proteins form a complex and bind to multiple Rabs in yeast (11Calero M. Winand N.J. Collins R.N.

Temperature-sensitive mutations in Yip1p and Yif1p have been shown to block ER-Golgi transport in vivo and lead to the accumulation of ER membranes and 40- to 50-nm vesicles (12Matern H. Yang X. Andrulis E. Sternglanz R. Trepte H.H. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4485-4492Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 13Yang X. Matern H.T. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4954-4963Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).Little is known about how the Yip1p family of proteins are involved in membrane traffic. Here we show that the Yip1p·Yif1p complex binds to ER to Golgi SNAREs and is required for the fusion of ER-derived vesicles with the Golgi apparatus. Because the Yip1p family of proteins is highly conserved, it is likely that these family members play a key role in membrane fusion at all stages of vesicle traffic in eukaryotic organisms.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibody Preparation and Purification—Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits using purified recombinant proteins. Recombinant Yip1p was expressed in bacteria as an N-terminal His tag fusion to amino acids 1–106 (pET-15b, Novagen) and purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To obtain purified recombinant Yif1p, an N-terminal GST fusion to amino acids 16–206 was expressed in bacteria using the vector pGEX-5x-3 and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies were affinity-purified on columns containing the appropriate fusion protein coupled to Affi-gel matrix (Bio-Rad). The antibodies retained on the columns were acid-eluted, neutralized, and dialyzed into TBS buffer (115 mm potassium acetate, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 250 mm sorbitol). For pre-absorption of anti-Yif1p antibody, 1 mg of purified GST or GST-Yif1p protein was transferred to nitrocellulose and incubated with affinity-purified antibody. Fab fragments were generated by digesting affinity-purified antibodies with papain using the ImmunoPure Fab preparation kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol.Construction of Gal1-YIP1 and Generation of a yip1 Temperature-sensitive Mutant—To place YIP1 under the control of the inducible GAL1 promoter, the open reading frame of YIP1 was cloned into pNB529 (LEU2 integrating vector), linearized, and transformed into a diploid strain in which the genomic copy of YIP1 had been disrupted with the HIS3 gene. Sporulation, dissection, and tetrad analysis were performed to obtain the haploid strain SFNY1105 (Gal+ura3–52 his3Δ200 yip1Δ::HIS3 leu2–3, 112 LEU2::GAL1-YIP1). PCR mutagenesis (19Muhlrad D. Hunter R. Parker R. Yeast. 1992; 8: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) was used to generate mutant alleles of yip1. Primers were used to amplify the YIP1 open reading frame under conditions of limiting dATP, dCTP, dGTP, or dTTP. Equal volumes of the PCR reactions were pooled. A gel-purified gapped plasmid was generated by removing a 511-bp fragment within the YIP1 open reading frame. The gapped plasmid (CEN/LEU2) was then co-transformed with the pooled PCR product into SFNY1159 (Gal+leu2–3, 112 his3Δ200 yip1Δ::HIS3 ura3–52 pSFNB905 (YIP1 URA3 CEN)). The plasmid containing YIP1 was subsequently lost by purifying the transformants on minimal media containing uracil and 1g/liter 5-fluoroorotic acid (Sigma). Surviving colonies were then tested for temperature sensitivity on YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose) plates. One mutant allele named yip1–3 was obtained. DNA sequence analysis revealed the presence of five mutations (E70G, T88A, K130E, F142L, and S146P).In Vitro Transport Assay—Standard transport assays, as well as the preparation of fractions and reagents, were performed as described previously (20Lian J.P. Ferro-Novick S. Cell. 1993; 73: 735-745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 21Ruohola H. Kabcenell A.K. Ferro-Novick S. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1465-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In all assays where antibody was included, a 20-min preincubation was performed on ice prior to the 20 °C incubation. Vesicles used for immunoprecipitation were produced during an in vitro budding reaction as described previously (20Lian J.P. Ferro-Novick S. Cell. 1993; 73: 735-745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Reactions were performed in the presence or absence of antibody (8–12 μg of anti-Yif1p or anti-Yip1p) as indicated with the exception that the protein A-Sepharose beads were washed four times with TBS buffer before boiling in sample buffer. To measure the fusion competence of vesicles produced in the presence or absence of antibody, vesicles were allowed to bud from donor cells during a 20-min incubation at 20 °C before the donor cells were pelleted during a 1-min spin in a microcentrifuge. Golgi membranes with or without antibody were then added to the reactions. Following a preincubation on ice to allow the antibody to bind, reactions were incubated at 20 °C for 1 h. Reactions were processed to obtain ConA-precipitable counts. Anti-outer chain-precipitable counts were normalized to the ConA-precipitable counts released from donor cells in the absence of antibody. The vesicle tethering assay was performed as described before (22Barrowman J. Sacher M. Ferro-Novick S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 862-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).Fractionation, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot Analysis— Lysates were prepared from yeast strains that had been shifted to 37 °C for 1 h (Fig. 4A) or from strains that had been grown in YPD for 14 h to deplete cells of Yip1p (Fig. 4B). Cells were converted to spheroplasts and lysed in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. Unbroken cells were pelleted during a brief spin at 450 × g. Lysates were centrifuged at 42,000 rpm in an SW50.1 rotor (170,000 × g) for 1 h. The pellets were resuspended in a volume of buffer equal to the supernatant fractions, and all fractions were boiled in sample buffer for analysis by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis.Glass bead lysates were prepared for immunoprecipitation of Yif1p. Briefly, 2 mg of lysate was diluted to a volume of 1 ml with IP buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors). Lysates were incubated for 1 h with 12 μg of affinity purified anti-Yif1p antibodies. The anti-Yif1p antibodies were bound to Protein A-Sepharose beads during a 1-h incubation. Beads were pelleted and washed five times with 1 ml of IP buffer, followed by boiling in 50 μl of SDS sample buffer.Standard Western blotting procedures with ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences) were performed. In some cases an alternative to ECL detection was used. Blots were blocked in buffer containing 0.25% gelatin and 1% bovine serum albumin, probed with primary antibody, and then incubated with 125I-labeled protein A (Amersham Biosciences) followed by exposure to Kodak film at -80 °C using an intensifying screen.In Vitro Binding Assays—Full-length Yip1p fused at its N terminus to MBP (maltose-binding protein) was expressed in bacteria and purified on amylose resin (New England BioLabs) as described by the manufacturer. His6-tagged fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). Prenylated Ypt1p was expressed in yeast as a His6-tagged fusion protein and purified from the membrane fraction as described before (23Nuoffer C. Peter F. Balch W.E. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Sso1p (amino acids 1–265) and Sec9p (amino acids 416–651) were purified as described before (24Nicholson K.L. Munson M. Miller R.B. Filip T.J. Fairman R. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). His6-Ypt1p was pre-loaded with nucleotide as described previously (25Wang W. Ferro-Novick S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3336-3343Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In vitro binding assays were performed by incubating varying amounts of tagged proteins, Sso1p, or Sec9p with 100 nm MBP-Yip1p (immobilized on beads) in a 100-μl reaction containing binding buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 140 mm potassium acetate, 0.1% gelatin, 0.2% CHAPS, 10% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Binding buffer contained 40 μm GDP in binding assays using pre-loaded Ypt1p. Also, binding experiments with non-prenylated Ypt1p were done in binding buffer containing 0.01% Triton X-100. Samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C or at room temperature for 1 h, and the beads were washed five times with 1 ml of binding buffer. The bound protein was eluted in SDS-sample buffer and detected by Western blot analysis using the ECL method (Amersham Biosciences).RESULTSAnti-Yif1p and Anti-Yip1p Antibodies Block ER-Golgi Transport in Vitro—As ongoing studies in our laboratory are focused on understanding how ER-derived transport vesicles tether to and fuse with the Golgi apparatus, we sought to understand the role of the Yip1p·Yif1p complex in these events. To begin to address this question, we raised antibodies to Yif1p and Yip1p and examined their ability to block transport in an in vitro assay that utilizes a precursor of the mating pheromone α-factor as a marker protein to measure ER-Golgi membrane traffic (21Ruohola H. Kabcenell A.K. Ferro-Novick S. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1465-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified antibodies to Yif1p efficiently blocked transport when added to reactions containing donor cells, cytosol, Golgi membranes, and an ATP-regenerating system (Fig. 1A, compare lane 1 and 2). The ability to inhibit transport was abolished if antibodies were pre-absorbed to GST-Yif1p (lane 4), whereas no effect was observed if the antibodies were pre-absorbed to GST (lane 3). Fab fragments generated from affinity-purified antibodies also blocked transport efficiently (lane 5). Similar results were obtained with anti-Yip1p affinity-purified antibodies (data not shown).Fig. 1Anti-Yif1p antibodies block ER to Golgi transport.A, standard transport reactions were performed in the absence (lane 1) or presence of 8 μg of anti-Yif1p antibody (lane 2), pre-absorbed to GST (lane 3) or GST-Yif1p (lane 4). Pre-absorption of anti-Yif1p antibody to GST-Yif1p, but not to GST, restored transport activity. Anti-Yif1p Fab fragments (15 μg) also blocked transport (lane 5). B, the decrease in budding efficiency, observed in the presence of anti-Yif1p antibody, does not correlate with the block in fusion. Assays were performed in the presence of the indicated amount of antibody. Maximum budding is the vesicle release observed in the absence of antibody. Similarly, maximum fusion is the outer-chain precipitable counts obtained in a reaction without antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We noted that, although fusion was efficiently blocked in reactions that contained anti-Yif1p or anti-Yip1p antibody, vesicle budding was somewhat decreased. To examine these effects more closely, we added increasing amounts of anti-Yif1p antibody to standard reactions and measured the effect on budding (Fig. 1B). Vesicle budding was measured as the percent of pro-α-factor released from donor-permeabilized cells. Membrane fusion was detected with an antiserum that recognizes Golgi-specific outer chain carbohydrate modifications. At concentrations of anti-Yif1p antibody that continued to inhibit fusion, budding was reduced by 50% or less. No further decrease was observed with increasing amounts of antibody. In contrast, fusion was completely blocked (Fig. 1B). Similar results were obtained with Fab fragments. Because of the reduction in vesicle budding, the anti-outer chain-precipitable counts were normalized to the amount of pro-α-factor released from donor cells (equal vesicles) in the absence of antibody. Thus, anti-Yif1p and anti-Yip1p antibodies efficiently block the late stages of ER to Golgi traffic.Anti-Yif1p and Anti-Yip1p Antibodies Must Be Present during Vesicle Budding to Block Membrane Fusion—We wished to address the requirement for Yif1p and Yip1p in the sequence of events that result in the targeting and tethering of vesicles to the Golgi. One way to address this question is to determine the step in the in vitro assay at which transport is sensitive to the addition of antibody. The in vitro transport assay can be divided into two stages, vesicle budding and membrane fusion, which can be assayed independently. To test the ability of anti-Yif1p and anti-Yip1p antibodies to block fusion when added before or after vesicles bud from the ER, vesicles were first formed by mixing donor cells with cytosol and an ATP-regenerating mix at 20 °C for 20 min in the absence of antibody. A parallel set of assays was prepared in which antibody was added at the beginning of the budding reaction. Donor cells were then pelleted in all samples, and the supernatant that contained the vesicles was removed. Vesicles formed in the absence of antibody were mixed with Golgi membranes and buffer, anti-Yif1p antibody, or anti-Yip1p antibody. Vesicles formed in the presence of antibodies were mixed with Golgi membranes. Following a 20-min incubation on ice to allow the antibodies to bind, all fusion reactions were shifted to 20 °C for 1 h. Surprisingly, we found that antibodies directed against Yif1p or Yip1p only blocked fusion when added before the budding reaction (Fig. 2, compare lane 1 with lanes 2 and 3). No block in fusion was observed when the antibodies were added directly to reactions containing vesicles and Golgi membranes (Fig. 2, compare lane 4 with lanes 5 and 6). In contrast, antibody to the ER-Golgi v-SNARE Bos1p blocked fusion when added before or after vesicle budding (data not shown). Thus, to generate fusion-competent vesicles, a function of Yip1p and Yif1p is specifically required during vesicle budding.Fig. 2Antibodies to Yif1p or Yip1p do not block fusion when added after vesicles bud from the ER. Vesicles were generated during a 20-min incubation in the presence of buffer (lane 1), anti-Yif1p (lane 2), or anti-Yip1p antibody (lane 3). Donor cells were pelleted, and Golgi membranes added to the supernatant were allowed to incubate with vesicles at 20 °C for 1 h before fusion was assayed. Conversely, in lanes 4–6 buffer (lane 4), anti-Yif1p (lane 5), or anti-Yip1p antibody (lane 6) was added to vesicles immediately following the budding reaction. Reactions were preincubated on ice with Golgi membranes to allow the antibody to bind before a 1-h incubation at 20 °C. All samples were normalized to the amount of pro-α-factor released from donor cells (equal vesicles) in the absence of antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Yif1p and Yip1p Are Required for Vesicle Fusion but Not Vesicle Tethering—For ER-derived vesicles to fuse with Golgi membranes they must undergo a sequence of upstream events that includes vesicle targeting, tethering, and docking. This ultimately ensures that the correct vesicle fuses with the appropriate acceptor compartment. Vesicles formed in the presence of antibody may exhibit a block in fusion due to a failure to target or tether to Golgi membranes. Alternatively, vesicles may tether to but not fuse with Golgi membranes. To distinguish between these possibilities and to examine the nature of the fusion block more closely, we employed a tethering assay that was described before (22Barrowman J. Sacher M. Ferro-Novick S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 862-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Transport reactions, performed in the presence or absence of anti-Yif1p antibody, were loaded onto sucrose gradients that separate free ER-derived vesicles from Golgi membranes. Tethered vesicles co-migrate with Golgi membranes (22Barrowman J. Sacher M. Ferro-Novick S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 862-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The migration of pro-α-factor was monitored by precipitating each gradient fraction with ConA-Sepharose. Vesicles incubated with antibody in the absence of Golgi peaked in fraction 5 (Fig. 3A). A shift to fractions 7–9 was observed upon addition of Golgi (Fig. 3B). The pro-α-factor that co-migrated with the Golgi peak in reactions containing anti-Yif1p (Fig. 3B) or anti-Yip1p antibody (data not shown) lacked outer chain carbohydrate (Fig. 3C). Similar results were obtained when Fab fragments of anti-Yif1p antibodies were used. This result indicates that, in the presence of antibodies directed against Yif1p or Yip1p, vesicles tethered but did not fuse with the Golgi.Fig. 3Vesicle fusion, but not vesicle tethering, is blocked in the presence of anti-Yif1p antibody. Five transport reactions were performed in one tube in the presence (triangles) or absence (circles) of anti-Yif1p antibody and subsequently loaded onto sucrose velocity gradients as described before (22Barrowman J. Sacher M. Ferro-Novick S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 862-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Fractions (1 ml) were collected and processed with ConA-Sepharose followed by precipitation with anti-outer chain serum as described previously (20Lian J.P. Ferro-Novick S. Cell. 1993; 73: 735-745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 22Barrowman J. Sacher M. Ferro-Novick S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 862-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A, vesicles formed in the presence of anti-Yif1p antibody peak in fraction 5. B, vesicles co-migrate with Golgi membranes (fractions 7–9) in the presence of anti-Yif1p antibody.

Yu J.A. Newman A.P. Ferro-Novick S. Nature. 1991; 351: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and Ypt1p is required for vesicle tethering (27Cao X. Ballew N. Barlowe C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2156-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 28Rexach M.F. Schekman R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In the yeast two-hybrid system, Yip1p family members bind preferentially to the prenylated form of Rab proteins (11Calero M. Winand N.J. Collins R.N. FEBS Lett. 2002; 515: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that these proteins serve as a membrane receptor, or platform, for Rab membrane recruitment. Our in vitro finding that Yip1p and Yif1p are required for vesicle fusion, but not tethering, implies that Ypt1p function is not affected when the Yip1p·Yif1p complex is inactivated and that Ypt1p may still be attached to membranes. To determine if this is indeed the case, we monitored the solubility of Ypt1p when Yip1p was defective. First, we generated a yip1 temperature-sensitive mutant using PCR mutagenesis. Lysates (T) prepared from wild type and a yip1–3 mutant that had been shifted to 37 °C for 1 h were centrifuged at 170,000 × g, fractionated into supernatant (S) and pellet (P) fractions and then blotted for the presence of Ypt1p. We observed no difference in the distribution of Ypt1p in yip1–3 lysates (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 1–3 with lanes 4–6). In contrast, Ypt1p was clearly more soluble in lysates prepared from bet2–1 (lanes 7–9), a mutant that is defective in Ypt1p prenylation (26Rossi G. Yu J.A. Newman A.P. Ferro-Novick S. Nature. 1991; 351: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).We also found that the membrane attachment of Ypt1p was not affected when cells were effectively depleted of Yip1p. A strain was constructed in which the sole copy of YIP1 was placed under the control of the inducible GAL1 promoter. Prior to lysing the cells and fractionating as described above, the GAL1-YIP1 strain (SFNY1105) was grown for 14 h in YPD media to deplete cells of Yip1p. Fractions were then blotted for the presence of Ypt1p and Yip1p. As seen in Fig. 4B, even though Yip1p could not be detected in the lysate fractions prepared from SFNY1105 (compare lanes 1–3 with 4–6), Ypt1p still sedimented with membranes.To rule out the possibility that Ypt1p was aggregating during sedimentation or was recruited to the wrong membrane, we performed subcellular fractionation studies. Lysates were prepared from SFNY1105 as described above and fractionated on a gradient previously used to separate the ER and Golgi where Ypt1p is normally found (22Barrowman J. Sacher M. Ferro-Novick S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 862-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 29Cao X. Barlowe C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The SNARE Bos1p marks the Golgi (Fig. 4C, fractions 3 and 4) and the ER (fractions 8 and 9) on this gradient. Soluble proteins are largely found at the top of the gradient, in fraction"
https://openalex.org/W1994587569,"In the renal collecting duct (CD) the major physiological role of aldosterone is to promote Na+ reabsorption. In addition, aldosterone may also influence CD water permeability elicited by vasopressin (AVP). We have previously shown that endogenous expression of the aquaporin-2 (AQP2) water channel in immortalized mouse cortical CD principal cells (mpkCCDC14) grown on filters is dramatically increased by administration of physiological concentrations of AVP. In the present study, we investigated the influence of aldosterone on AQP2 expression in mpkCCDC14 cells by RNase protection assay and Western blot analysis. Aldosterone reduced AQP2 mRNA and protein expression when administered together with AVP for short periods of time (≤24 h). For longer periods of time, however, aldosterone increased AQP2 protein expression despite sustained low expression levels of AQP2 mRNA. Both events were dependent on mineralocorticoid receptor occupancy because they were both induced by a low concentration of aldosterone (10–9m) and were abolished by the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist canrenoate. Inhibition of lysosomal AQP2 protein degradation increased AQP2 protein expression in AVP-treated cells, an effect that was potentiated by aldosterone. Finally, both aldosterone and actinomycin D delayed AQP2 protein decay following AVP washout, but in a non-cumulative manner. Taken together, our data suggest that aldosterone tightly modulates AQP2 protein expression in cultured mpkCCDC14 cells by increasing AQP2 protein turnover while maintaining low levels of AQP2 mRNA expression.

AQP2 belongs to the family of water channel proteins that facilitate osmotically driven water movement across cell membranes. At least six members of the AQP family (AQP1, AQP2, AQP3, AQP4, AQP6, and AQP7) are expressed in the kidney (1Denker B.M. Smith B.L. Kuhajda F.P. Agre P. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1995; 269: F775-F785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AVP increases CD water permeability by binding to the vasopressin V2-receptor located in the basolateral membrane of CD principal cells, an event that promotes AQP2 translocation from intracellular storage vesicles to the apical membrane (8Nielsen S. Chou C.L. Marples D. Christensen E.I. Kishore B.K. Knepper M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Water exits the cells through AQP3 and AQP4 water channels expressed in the basolateral membrane of CD cells. This process, induced by acute increases in AVP plasma concentration, occurs within minutes and is reversible. Declining levels of circulating AVP quickly lead to endocytotic retrieval of apical AQP2 and to reduced CD water permeability (8Nielsen S. Chou C.L. Marples D. Christensen E.I. Kishore B.K. Knepper M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Besides this rapid action, AVP also controls AQP2 expression over longer periods of time (from several hours to several days) (9Nielsen S. DiGiovanni S.R. Christensen E.I. Knepper M.A. Harris H.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11663-11667Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Accordingly, normal and AVP-deficient Brattleboro rats infused with AVP over a period of several days display increased levels of AQP2 expression (10Hayashi M. Sasaki S. Tsuganezawa H. Monkawa T.

Christensen B.M. Frokiaer J. Knepper M.A. Nielsen S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F400-F409PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies, however, have documented conditions under which AQP2 expression can be influenced by mechanisms other than AVP. Decreased levels of AQP2 expression that occur despite normal or even increased circulating AVP levels have been described in nephrotic syndrome (14Apostol E. Ecelbarger C.A. Terris J. Bradford A.D.

Several factors are expected to influence long term AQP2 expression. In the present study, we investigated the influence of aldosterone on AQP2 mRNA and protein expression. The major role of aldosterone is to promote unidirectional Na+ transport across a variety of epithelial tissues of high intercellular electrical resistance (21Funder J.F. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. Suppl. 1998; 25: S47-S50Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In the kidney, aldosterone promotes Na+ reabsorption principally by increasing whole cell abundance and cell membrane expression of apical epithelial Na+ channels and basolateral Na,K-ATPase units in the late portion of the distal tubule and in the collecting duct (22MacDonald P. MacKenzie S. Ramage L.E. Seckl J.R. Brown R.W. J. Endocrinol. 2000; 165: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 23Loffing J. Zecevic M. Feraille E. Kaissling B. Asher C. Rossier B.C.

Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2000: 1441-1471Google Scholar). Besides its role in controlled Na+ reabsorption, some pieces of evidence suggest that aldosterone influences water reabsorption as well. Patients with chronic adrenal insufficiency are unable to generate maximally concentrated urine (26Wilson D.M. Sundermann F.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1939; 18: 35-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a situation that can be reproduced in adrenalectomized rats (27Schwartz M.J. Kokko J.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 66: 234-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and administration of the aldosterone antagonist spironolactone was found to increase dilute urine production in patients with severe congestive heart failure (28van Vliet A.A. Donker A.J. Nauta J.J. Verheugt F.W. Am. J. Cardiol. 1993; 71 (A): 21A-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The effect of aldosterone on AQP2 expression in animals has lead to apparently contrasting results. Whereas normal rats treated with the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist canrenoate displayed increased urinary output and decreased renal AQP2 expression (29Jonassen T.E. Promeneur D. Christensen S. Petersen J.S. Nielsen S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F246-F256Google Scholar), AQP2 expression levels in hypovolemic rats with selective aldosterone deficiency were found to be increased in the inner medulla (30Ohara M.

The results of the present study indicate that aldosterone significantly alters AQP2 whole cell protein content in cultured mpkCCDcl4 cells by modulating both AQP2 mRNA abundance and translational regulation. Cell Culture—mpkCCDC14 cells (passages 20–30) were grown in modified defined medium (DM: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12, 1:1 (v/v), 60 nm sodium selenate, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 2 mm glutamine, 50 nm dexamethasone, 1 nm triiodothyronine, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 5 μg/ml insulin, 20 mm d-glucose, 2% fetal calf serum, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) (32Bens M. Vallet V. Cluzeaud F. Pascual-Letallec L. Kahn A. RafestinOblin M.E. Rossier B.C. Vandewalle A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 923-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere. The medium was changed every 2 days. Experiments were performed on confluent cells seeded on semi-permeable polycarbonate filters (Transwell™, 0.4 μm pore size, 1 cm2 growth area, Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA). Cells were grown in DM until confluence (day 6 after seeding), and then placed in serum-free, hormone-deprived DM 24 h before the experiments. Western Blot Analysis—After incubation in the presence of AVP and/or drugs, confluent cultured mpkCCDC14 cells grown on filters were incubated with AVP and without or with aldosterone and/or drugs to be tested. Cells were then rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then homogenized in 150 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 30 mm sodium fluoride, 30 mm Na4O7P2, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4). Protein concentrations were measured by the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein from lysed samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilion-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked by incubation with Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 and 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk for 30 min at room temperature. Membranes were probed overnight at 4 °C with a polyclonal rabbit anti-rat AQP2 antibody (1:20000) (35Xu D.L. Martin P.-Y. Ohara M. St. John J. Pattison T. Meng X. Morris K. Kim J.K. Schrier R.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1500-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) or with a polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse protein kinase Aα catalytic subunit antibody (1:2000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) washed three times with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and then incubated with secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:20000) (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 and the antigen-antibody complexes were detected by the Super Signal Substrate method (Pierce). Identified protein bands were quantified using a video densitometer and ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). RNase Protection Assay—Mouse genomic DNA was extracted from mpkCCDC14 cells using the DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A mouse AQP2 cDNA (NCBI accession number NM_009699) fragment coding for the 81–279 nucleotide sequence was PCR amplified using sense and antisense primers containing EcoRI and XbaI restriction sites, respectively, and cloned into pCIneo (Promega, Madison, WI). Computer-assisted alignment sequence analyses confirmed the specificity of the cDNA fragment used. The sequence of the PCR-amplified fragment was checked by sequencing. The plasmid was then linearized with NheI restriction enzyme and 1 μg was used to produce antisense AQP2 transcripts (riboprobes) using T3 RNA polymerase in the presence of 50 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (Amersham Biosciences). Acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P0 (EMBL accession number BC011106) antisense probe was used as an internal standard. A fragment coding for the 170–315-nucleotide sequence was PCR amplified using sense and antisense primers containing EcoRI and XbaI restriction sites, respectively, and cloned into pBluescript SK– (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Computer-assisted alignment sequence analyses confirmed the specificity of the cDNA fragment used, and the sequence of the PCR amplified fragment was checked by sequencing. The plasmid was then linearized with the XhoI restriction enzyme and 1 μg was used to produce antisense P0 riboprobes using T3 RNA polymerase in the presence of 5 μCi of [α-32P]UTP to avoid signal saturation because of the greater abundance of P0 rRNA as compared with AQP2 rRNA. Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ten μg of riboprobe completed with 21 μg of yeast tRNA were used for hybridization with 2 × 105 cpm of AQP2 probe and 5 × 104 cpm of P0 probe. Yeast tRNA (25 μg) was used as a negative control. Hybridization was performed for 60 min at 70 °C followed by RNase A/T1 mixture digestion (Ambion, Austin, TX) for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS and proteinase K. RNA duplexes were extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and precipitated with ammonium acetate/ethanol. Samples were then denatured in gel loading buffer at 95 °C for 5 min, run together with non-digested riboprobes on a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel, and autoradiographed. Identified fragments were quantified using a video densitometer and ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Statistics—Results are given as the mean ± S.E. from n independent experiments. Each experiment was performed on cultured cells from the same passage. Statistical differences were assessed using the Mann-Whitney U test or the Kruskal-Wallis test for comparison of two or more than two groups, respectively. A p < 0.05 was considered significant. Effects of Aldosterone on AVP-induced AQP2 Protein Expression in Mouse Collecting Duct Principal Cells—We have previously shown that the low levels of endogenous AQP2 mRNA and protein expression in untreated mpkCCDC14 cells grown on filters can be dramatically increased by addition of physiological concentrations of AVP to the basal medium (34Hasler U. Mordasini D. Bens M. Bianchi M. Cluzeaud F. Rousselot M. Vandewalle A. Feraille E. Martin P.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 22: 10379-10386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the effects of aldosterone on AQP2 abundance in mpkCCDC14 cells treated with AVP. We first analyzed both short and long term aldosterone action by treating mpkCCDC14 cells with AVP alone or with both AVP and aldosterone for various lengths of time. Two different protocols were used for this study. In a first set of experiments, endogenous AQP2 expression was first increased by pretreating mpkCCDC14 cells with 10–9m AVP for 24 h after which time the cells were subjected to additional periods of incubation (3–48 h) in the continuous presence of AVP and in the presence or absence of 10–6m aldosterone (Fig. 1, A and B). In a second set of experiments, mpkCCDC14 cells were treated with either 10–9m AVP alone or with both 10–9m AVP and 10–6m aldosterone, added simultaneously to the cell medium, for 3–48 h (Fig. 1, C and D). We used AVP at a concentration of 10–9m to maximally stimulate AQP2 expression (34Hasler U. Mordasini D. Bens M. Bianchi M. Cluzeaud F. Rousselot M. Vandewalle A. Feraille E. Martin P.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 22: 10379-10386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Aldosterone was used at 10–6m because this concentration maximally stimulates sodium transport in mpkCCDcl4 cells (32Bens M. Vallet V. Cluzeaud F. Pascual-Letallec L. Kahn A. RafestinOblin M.E. Rossier B.C. Vandewalle A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 923-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of AVP-treated mpkCCDC14 cells typically revealed a narrow 28-kDa band and a more diffuse band of about 35 kDa corresponding to the non-glycosylated and fully glycosylated forms of AQP2 protein, respectively. An additional faint band of about 31 kDa corresponding to the core-glycosylated form of AQP2 protein was also detected (Fig. 1, A and C). Although the amount of AQP2 protein increased over time in cells treated with AVP alone and in cells treated with both AVP and aldosterone, aldosterone was found to significantly alter AQP2 protein content when added 24 h after AVP and when added simultaneously with AVP. Indeed, AQP2 protein content significantly decreased shortly (≤24 h) following administration of aldosterone, as compared with AQP2 expression levels of cells treated with AVP alone (Fig. 1, A and C, lanes 1–10, and B and D). Longer periods (48 h) of aldosterone stimulation, however, significantly increased AQP2 protein expression as compared with that of cells treated with AVP alone (Fig. 1, A and C, lanes 11 and 12, and B and D). Both effects were mediated by aldosterone, i.e. down- and up-regulated abundance of AQP2 protein, could be reproduced in mpkCCDcl4 cells first pretreated 24 h with 10–6m aldosterone and then exposed to 10–9m AVP for additional lengths of time (3–48 h) (data not shown). Cells treated with aldosterone alone did not exhibit any change in AQP2 expression at any time (data not shown). These results indicate that aldosterone exerts a biphasic effect on AVP-induced AQP2 protein expression in mpkCCDcl4 cells: for short periods of time (≤24 h) aldosterone decreases AVP-elicited AQP2 protein expression whereas the steroid hormone enhances AQP2 expression for longer periods of time (>24 h). To investigate whether the short and long term effects of aldosterone on vasopressin-stimulated AQP2 protein expression were mediated through mineralocorticoid receptors (MR), we compared the effects of 10–9m aldosterone (a concentration corresponding to half-maximal MR occupancy) and 10–6m aldosterone (a concentration corresponding to half-maximal occupancy of both MR and glucocorticoid receptor). In addition, we tested the effect of canrenoate, a specific MR antagonist. The extent of decreased AQP2 protein expression was similar in confluent mpkCCDC14 cells treated with 10–9m AVP administered together with either 10–6 or 10–9m aldosterone for 9 h (Fig. 2, A, left panel, compare lanes 2 and 3, and B) whereas AQP2 protein expression of cells simultaneously treated with 10–9m AVP and 10–6 or 10–9m aldosterone for 48 h increased by 100 and 50%, respectively, as compared with that of cells treated with AVP alone (Fig. 2, A, right panel, compare lane 1 to lanes 2 and 3, and B). Moreover, 10–6m canrenoate, which had no effect on cells treated with AVP alone, abolished both aldosterone-dependent down- and up-regulation of AQP2 protein observed after 9 and 48 h of incubation, respectively (Fig. 2, C and D). These observations suggest that both effects of aldosterone on AQP2 protein expression are mediated by the MR. In addition, the observation that aldosterone induced AQP2 down- and up-regulation when administered at a concentration of 10–9m further adds to the physiological relevance of aldosterone action on AQP2 expression in cultured mpkCCDcl4 cells. The effect of aldosterone on AQP2 mRNA expression was next investigated by RNase protection assay (RPA). mRNA was extracted from cells treated with 10–9m AVP alone or with both 10–9m AVP and 10–6m aldosterone for 3–48 h. Signals corresponding to the protected fragments of the acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P0 mRNA probe were visible in each tested condition at similar intensities (Fig. 3A, bottom panel) and were used as an internal standard to estimate the levels of AQP2 mRNA expression. A signal corresponding to protected fragments of the AQP2 mRNA probe was detected after only 3 h of AVP treatment in cells treated with AVP alone (Fig. 3A, top panel, lane 1) and gradually increased for longer incubation times (Fig. 3, A, lanes 3, 5, and 7, and B). The expression levels of AQP2 mRNA of cells treated with both AVP and aldosterone, however, were constantly lower than those of cells subjected to AVP alone over the entire length of time investigated (3–48 h) (Fig. 3, A, lanes 4, 6, and 8, and B). These results suggest that the increase of AQP2 protein expression elicited by aldosterone for long incubation periods (>24 h) in AVP-treated mpkCCDcl4 cells is not directly linked to an increase in AQP2 mRNA expression. We have previously shown that the increased expression levels of AQP2 mRNA and protein of mpkCCDcl4 cells incubated 24 h with 10–9m AVP return to near base-line levels when subjected to 24 h of AVP chase, i.e. an additional incubation period following AVP washout. Analysis of AQP2 protein expression under conditions of AVP chase revealed two distinct phases: an initial phase consisting of a sharp rise in AQP2 protein expression immediately following AVP removal from the medium and a second phase consisting of a gradual AQP2 protein decay (34Hasler U. Mordasini D. Bens M. Bianchi M. Cluzeaud F. Rousselot M. Vandewalle A. Feraille E. Martin P.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 22: 10379-10386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Here, we investigated the effect of aldosterone under conditions of AVP chase by first incubating mpkCCDC14 cells 24 h with 10–9m AVP and then for additional lengths of time (0.5–9 h) without or with 10–6m aldosterone following AVP washout. Western blot analysis revealed that aldosterone significantly altered AQP2 protein expression in the absence of AVP (Fig. 4, A and B). As previously observed (34Hasler U. Mordasini D. Bens M.

Chem. 2002; 22: 10379-10386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (150) Google Scholar), the amount of AQP2 protein measured in cells subjected to an AVP chase in the absence of aldosterone increased shortly following AVP washout (Fig. 4, A, compare lane 1 with lanes 2 and 4, and B) and then gradually decreased for longer periods of AVP chase (Fig. 4, A, lanes 6, 8, and 10, and B). AQP2 protein expression of cells treated with aldosterone also rapidly increased following AVP washout (≤1 h, Fig. 4, A, compare lane 1 with lanes 3 and 5, and B) but remained lower than that of aldosterone-deprived cells subjected to an AVP chase for the same period of time (Fig. 4, A, compare lanes 2 and 4 with lanes 3 and 5, and B). Three hours following AVP washout, however, AQP2 protein content of cells treated with aldosterone increased and reached significantly higher levels than those of aldosterone-deprived cells subjected to the same 3-h AVP chase period and those of aldosterone-treated cells subjected to 1 h of AVP chase (Fig. 4, A, compare lane 7 with lanes 5 and 6, and B). These high AQP2 protein expression levels gradually decreased for longer periods of AVP chase but remained higher than those of aldosterone-deprived cells subjected to the same conditions of AVP chase (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 9 and 11 to lanes 8 and 10, and B). AQP2 protein expression returned to baseline levels 24 h after AVP washout in both aldosterone-treated and aldosterone-deprived cells (data not shown). We next investigated AQP2 mRNA expression under conditions of AVP chase by first incubating cells 24 h with 10–9m AVP and then for an additional 9 h in the absence or presence of 10–6m aldosterone following AVP washout (Fig. 4, C and D). As revealed by RPA analysis, whereas AQP2 mRNA expression of cells treated 9 h with 10–9m AVP significantly decreased when the cells were co-incubated with 10–6m aldosterone (Fig. 4, C, lanes 2 and 3, and D), AQP2 mRNA expression of 24-h AVP-pretreated cells subjected to 9 h of AVP chase returned to baseline levels regardless of the presence or absence of aldosterone (Fig. 4, C, compare lanes 4 and 5 to lane 1, and D). These results indicate that the increase of AQP2 protein expression induced by aldosterone under conditions of AVP chase is not because of an increase in AQP2 mRNA expression. Effect of Aldosterone on AQP2 Protein Degradation in Mouse Collecting Duct Principal Cells—Our results show that aldosterone increases AQP2 protein content after long periods of incubation (48 h) and under conditions of AVP chase. This led us to investigate the role of protein degradation in the aldosterone-induced up-regulation of AQP2 protein. We have previously shown that inhibitors of the lysosomal protein degradation pathway enhance AQP2 protein expression in AVP-treated mpkCCDCl4 cells and reduce AQP2 degradation in cells subjected to an AVP chase (34Hasler U.

We show that these cells exhibit global Ca2+ waves and local apical Ca2+ spikes. This is the first evidence for local Ca2+ signaling in undissociated pancreatic tissue. The mechanism of formation of localized Ca2+ signals was examined using a novel approach involving photolysis of caged carbachol inside a patch pipette attached to the basal surface of an acinar unit. This local activation of basal muscarinic receptors elicited local cytosolic Ca2+ spikes in the apical pole more than 15 μm away from the site of stimulation. In some experiments, local basal receptor activation elicited a Ca2+ wave that started in the apical pole and then spread toward the base. Currently, there are two competing hypotheses for preferential apical Ca2+ signaling. One invokes the need for structural proximity of the cholinergic receptors and the Ca2+ release channels in the apical pole, whereas the other postulates long distance communication between basal receptors and the channels.

In response to agonist stimulation, many cell types produce transient elevations in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), which remain localized to a specific subcellular domain (1Bootman M.D. Lipp P. Berridge M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; : 2213-2222PubMed Google Scholar). In isolated pancreatic acinar cells, a low concentration of acetylcholine (ACh) 1The abbreviations used are: ACh, acetylcholine; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; CCh, carbachol; AM, acetoxymethyl ester. can evoke repetitive local cytosolic Ca2+ spikes, which are confined to the granule containing apical pole (2Thorn P. Lawrie A.M. Smith P.M. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 661-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). These local Ca2+ spikes can activate exocytosis through the apical plasma membrane (3Maruyama Y. Inooka G. Li Y.X. Miyashita Y. Kasai H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3017-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and open Ca2+-dependent Cl-channels present exclusively in the apical plasma membrane, thereby regulating acinar fluid secretion (4Park M.K. Lomax R.B. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10948-10953Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Agonist-receptor interaction causes activation of phospholipase C and the generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), which in turn opens Ca2+ release channels in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (5Streb H. Irvine R.F. Berridge M.J. Schulz I. Nature. 1983; 306: 67-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar), thereby explaining the liberation of Ca2+ from this intracellular store (6Nielsen S.P. Petersen O.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1972; 223: 685-697Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Because the G-protein coupled receptors for cholecystokinin are localized in the basolateral plasma membrane as demonstrated in early autoradiographic studies on intact pancreas (7Rosenzweig S.A. Miller L.J. Jamieson J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1288-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), the classical view of pancreatic acinar cell stimulation involves the binding of agonist to plasma membrane receptors located at the base. It is this end of the cell that is close to blood vessels and pancreatic nerve terminals from where physiologically released agonists approach the cell (8Motta P.M. Macchiarelli G. Nottola S.A. Correr S. Microsc. Res. Technol. 1997; 37: 384-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). If agonist-receptor interaction occurs at the base and Ca2+ release occurs at the opposite (apical) pole, there is a need for a long distance Ca2+-releasing intracellular messenger. The established Ca2+-releasing messenger IP3 (9Bootman M.D. Collins T.J. Peppiatt C.M. Prothero L.S. MacKenzie L. De Smet P. Travers M. Tovey S.C. Seo J.T. Berridge M.J. Ciccolini F. Lipp P. Semin.

Therefore, it has been proposed that messenger(s) generated at the basal membrane in response to agonist stimulation easily diffuse across the cell and release Ca2+ primarily in the apical pole because of the high density of Ca2+ release channels in this part of the cell (2Thorn P.

The view that the primary site of the neurotransmitter- or hormone-elicited intracellular Ca2+ release is determined not by the site of the neurotransmitter or hormone-receptor interaction but by the localization of the Ca2+ release channels (13Petersen O.H. Petersen C.C. Kasai H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 297-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) has been challenged in a recent study (18Shin D.M. Luo X. Wilkie T.M. Miller L.J. Peck A.B.

This study shows localization of receptors close to the apical end of the cell in regions near to the tight junctions. The authors suggest that apical Ca2+ signals are preferentially produced in that region as a result of nearby production of intracellular messengers. The apparent contradiction between this study (18Shin D.M. Luo X. Wilkie T.M. Miller L.J. Peck A.B. Humphreys-Beher M.G. Muallem S. J. Biol.

Because all previous Ca2+ signaling studies in the exocrine pancreas were carried out on isolated acinar cells or cell clusters, we first demonstrated that in intact undissociated pancreatic tissue, ACh stimulation preferentially produces [Ca2+]i elevations in the apical region of the acinar cells. Using intrapipette uncaging of carbachol (CCh), we then show that activation of muscarinic receptors in a very small restricted area of the basal plasma membrane is able to produce localized Ca2+ responses at the opposite end of the cell in the apical pole. Cell Preparation, Solutions, Dye Loading, and Chemicals—All of the experiments were performed at room temperature (22–24 °C). The pancreas was removed from mice killed by cervical dislocation. The isolated pancreas was immediately placed into extracellular solution, which contained (in mm): 140 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.13 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.2 (adjusted by NaOH). Freshly isolated mouse pancreatic clusters of acinar cells were prepared as described previously (2Thorn P. Lawrie A.M. Smith P.M. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H.

All of the experiments were performed during continuous superperfusion of extracellular solution. Agonists and antagonists were added to the extracellular solution at the stated concentrations. Fluo-4 AM, Fura Red AM, caged fluorescein dextran-10K, α-carboxy-2-nitrobenzyl-caged carbachol, Mitotracker Green FM, and Lysotracker Red were from Molecular Probes. Hoechst 33342 was from Calbiochem. Loading/staining of cells with fluorescent compounds was achieved by incubation of cells/tissue with the particular dye in darkness at room temperature (except when specifically mentioned) under the following conditions: Fluo-4 AM (2.5 μm for 25 min); Fura Red AM (10 μm for 30 min); Mitotracker Green FM (500 nm for 25 min at 37 °C); Lysotracker Red (200 nm for 5 min); Hoechst 33342 (100 μg/ml for 2 min). Collagenase was obtained from Worthington, and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Confocal Imaging—Fluorescence images were obtained using either a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope or a Leica SP2 confocal microscope with ×40 oil-immersion or ×63 water-immersion objective. During the experiments, intact pancreatic tissue was immobilized on a glass coverslip using either a needle through the tissue or a slice hold-down (Warner Instruments). Intact tissue or cells adhered to poly-l-lysine-coated slides were imaged on the stage of an inverted microscope (Axiovert 100M, Zeiss, or DMIRBE from Leica). Fluo-4 AM, Mitotracker Green FM, and caged fluorescein dextran-10K were excited by a 488 nm laser line, and emission was collected through a bandpass filter of 505–550 nm. Fura Red was excited at 488 nm, and emitted light was collected through a long pass 560-nm filter or bandpass 580–680-nm filter. Excitation of Lysotracker Red was by a 543-nm laser line, and emission was collected through a long pass 570-nm filter. Hoechst 33342 was excited by UV light (364 nm), and emission was collected between 400 and 450 nm. Intrapipette Uncaging—Standard patch clamp technique was adapted using the EPC-8 amplifier and Pulse software (HEKA). We used pipettes having resistances of 2–4 megohms. Pipettes were back-filled with the extracellular solution containing, in addition, either 5 mg/ml caged fluorescein dextran-10K or 50 μm-5 mm caged CCh. Seals of 5–10 giga-ohm resistance were obtained between the pipette and the basal plasma membrane of individual acinar cells in small clusters. Uncaging was achieved during the scanning procedure by exposure of pre-defined regions to UV laser light at 364 and 351 nm. The regions were selected to surround the pipette but not expose the cell. Subcellular Localized Calcium Signaling in Intact Epithelial Tissue—Confocal fluorescence microscopy was used to image the Ca2+-sensitive dye, Fluo-4, in the cytoplasm of cells that were stimulated by bath perfusion of physiological agonists. We used an undissociated pancreatic preparation to image large areas of intact pancreatic tissue (see Fig. 1A) and showed that application of ACh triggered repetitive [Ca2+]i elevations in nearly all of the cells (n = 25 experiments). An analysis of the fluorescence changes in individual cells revealed the spatiotemporal profile of these Ca2+ oscillations (Fig. 1A). In some cells, lower levels of stimulation caused [Ca2+]i oscillations that were restricted entirely to the secretory granule region at the apical end of the cell (Fig. 1A, images 1–3 (n = 9)). Increasing the ACh concentration changed the profile of each transient from local to global. At higher doses, the [Ca2+]i transient became a wave, which was initiated at the apical pole and spread toward the basal plasma membrane (Fig. 1A, images 4–7 (n = 22)). As the intensity of stimulation increased, the oscillations became superimposed on an elevated base line (Fig. 1A). These observations demonstrate that pancreatic acinar cells in their native environment can produce apically localized [Ca2+]i elevations and global Ca2+ waves initiated in the apical region. Specific patterns of Ca2+ signaling are translated into the responses of cellular organelles such as exocytosis of secretory granules (19Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 191-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), changes of mitochondrial metabolism (20Voronina S. Sukhomlin T. Johnson P.R. Erdemli G. Petersen O.H.

Nature. 1998; 392: 933-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar). Also, the positioning of intracellular organelles can have profound implications for patterns of [Ca2+]i signaling (23Tinel H. Cancela J.M. Mogami H. Gerasimenko J.V. Gerasimenko O.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4999-5008Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 24Park M.K. Ashby M.C. Erdemli G. Petersen O.H. Tepikin A.V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1863-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). We assessed the intracellular position of the major intracellular organelles in live cells within intact pancreatic tissue. The secretory (zymogen) granules were labeled using Lysotracker Red (based upon the affinity of the dye for acidic compartments), nuclei were stained using Hoechst 33342, and mitochondria were stained using Mitotracker Green FM. The majority of acidic compartments (mostly representing zymogen granules) were found near the apical (luminal) membrane (Fig. 1B). The acinar lumen was often visible as an unstained region between the cells. The nucleus or nuclei were always found outside the zymogen granule region toward the base (Fig. 1B). In isolated pancreatic acinar cells, several studies have shown that mitochondria have distinct and specific intracellular locations. The majority of the mitochondria are positioned in a perigranular belt, which limits the spread of apically localized Ca2+ signals (23Tinel H. Cancela J.M. Mogami H. Gerasimenko J.V. Gerasimenko O.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4999-5008Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). This positioning was also apparent in the intact tissue, because the strongest mitochondrial staining was in the perigranular region (Fig. 1B). In addition, Mitotracker Green staining also revealed the perinuclear and subplasmalemmal mitochondria that have been identified in isolated cells (Fig. 1B) (24Park M.K. Ashby M.C. Erdemli G. Petersen O.H. Tepikin A.V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1863-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The intracellular positioning of mitochondria is thought to have important functional interactions with nearby Ca2+ signaling pathways (24Park M.K. Ashby M.C. Erdemli G. Petersen O.H. Tepikin A.V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1863-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 25Glitsch M.D. Bakowski D. Parekh A.B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6744-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 26Montero M.

Our observations in the intact pancreas highlight the relevance of the polarity of organelles and Ca2+ signaling in cells within their native environment. Long Distance Signaling Demonstrated by Intrapipette Uncaging of Carbachol—Acinar cells within the intact pancreas can produce local apical [Ca2+]i spikes when ACh is applied to the basal side of the epithelium. This highlights the need for understanding the mechanism by which the local apical Ca2+ signals are generated. Here we have studied the patterns of Ca2+ signaling induced by exclusive stimulation of basally located receptors. To specifically excite basal receptors, we have combined electrophysiological and photolytic (uncaging) techniques. A patch pipette containing caged agonist in standard extracellular solution was used to isolate a small area of the basal membrane of a single acinar cell within a cluster of cells (3–10 cells). We used isolated cell clusters because the patching of cells within the intact pancreas was impossible because of the capsule surrounding the tissue. During continuous superfusion of the cell clusters, a high resistance (5–10 giga-ohms) seal was formed between the basal cell membrane and the glass pipette. Such a configuration could then be used to photolyse caged carbachol by UV laser light exposure of pre-defined regions (shown as dashed orange lines throughout) surrounding the pipette but avoiding the cells. To test this experimental configuration, we used caged fluorescein dextran-10K in the pipette and loaded the cytoplasm of the cells with the Ca2+-sensitive dye, Fura Red. This allowed us to characterize the intrapipette uncaging and test whether UV exposure itself would cause any [Ca2+]i elevation (Fig. 2). As expected, each UV exposure caused an increase in the fluorescence of fluorescein inside the pipette as the compound was uncaged (Fig. 2, n = 4). The increase in fluorescence peaked at the first frame obtained after uncaging and then declined, initially rapidly and then more slowly. This decline presumably reflects dilution of the product of uncaging in the solution in the rest of the pipette, which is much larger than the volume exposed to UV light. The uncaging itself did not cause any change in [Ca2+]I, whereas subsequent application of ACh to the bath triggered a large rapidly evolving [Ca2+]i transient (Fig. 2). These experiments showed that we can selectively expose a small region of basal plasma membrane to a photolytically activated compound. This technique is equally applicable to studies using site-specific stimulation of many other cell types including neurons, which produce polarized responses to stimulation. The rapid time course and range of UV exposure makes intrapipette uncaging faster, more sensitive, and better regulated than other local stimulation techniques (2Thorn P. Lawrie A.M. Smith P.M. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 661-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). We tested the ability of CCh to trigger changes in [Ca2+]i measured by Fluo-4 in the cytoplasm of the cells when uncaged inside a cell-attached pipette. We found that intrapipette uncaging of carbachol at the basal pole was often able to trigger short lasting [Ca2+]I elevations, which were restricted to the extreme apex of the cell (Fig. 3A, n = 11 cells). The distance between the basal membrane under the pipette and the point of Ca2+ release was always over 15 μm and up to a distance of 25 μm. Approximately 60% of the cells responded to uncaging by producing Ca2+ signals, and each uncaging event usually only triggered a single Ca2+ spike. Intriguingly, in the other experiments, it was not possible to trigger Ca2+ release even with very strong and/or long lasting UV exposure. This inability of even strong uncagings to trigger Ca2+ signals in 40% of the cells could be explained either by insufficient production of second messengers or by absence of receptors under the patch pipette because of receptor clustering in other regions of the basal membrane. The clustering of transmembrane receptors has been reported previously (27Thomason P.A. Wolanin P.M. Stock J.B. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R399-R401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and is proposed to underlie high sensitivity areas of membrane that are able to amplify low level extracellular stimuli. We compared the size of the [Ca2+]i rises triggered by intrapipette CCh uncaging to those caused by bath application of ACh (10 nm) (Fig. 3A). Short lasting uncaging events (UV exposure of 100–500 ms) consistently generated smaller responses than ACh in the same cell (n = 4). For these durations of uncaging, the [Ca2+]i signals were localized to the apical part of the cells. To be certain that only muscarinic receptors under the patch pipette would be responsible for generating the intracellular Ca2+ release, we carried out experiments in which we made sure that even in the unlikely event that some of the uncaged CCh could escape the pipette, no activation of receptors outside the area of the plasma membrane covered by the patch pipette would occur. We blocked all muscarinic receptors outside the pipette by adding atropine (100 μm) after the gigaseal formation. This atropine concentration always blocked [Ca2+]i elevations triggered by ACh (1 μm) applied to the bath (n = 12). Under these conditions, short intrapipette uncaging was still able to trigger a localized [Ca2+]i elevation at the extreme apical pole of the cell (Fig. 3B, n = 6 cells). This confirms that the pipette does indeed form an impenetrable seal with the membrane (otherwise the extremely high atropine concentration in the bath would have prevented the uncaged CCh in the pipette from interacting with the muscarinic receptors under the patch pipette) and that only receptors under the pipette can be activated following uncaging. Global Ca2+Waves Triggered by Basal Intrapipette CCh Uncaging—The time course and size of the [Ca2+]i elevations described above correlate with a low level of ACh activation in studies on isolated cells (2Thorn P. Lawrie A.M. Smith P.M. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 661-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether stronger activation of receptors in a small area of basal plasma membrane could generate larger global [Ca2+]i rises. Intrapipette uncaging of longer duration (800 ms-1.5 s) or repetitive short uncagings were able to trigger global Ca2+ waves (Fig. 4, n = 4). Such waves were always initiated in the apical region and propagated toward the basal plasma membrane, demonstrating that activation of a small area of basal plasma membrane is able to produce significant activation of intracellular Ca2+ signaling mechanisms. In some of our intrapipette uncaging experiments (n = 4), we could trigger a Ca2+ wave that propagated from the stimulated cell to other cells in the same cluster. This suggests that the level of second messenger produced by intrapipette uncaging is sufficient to support the spreading of the [Ca2+]I rise via gap junctions. The long distance signaling demonstrated directly in this study must rely on the production of some diffusible intracellular messenger following receptor activation. IP3, cyclic ADP-ribose, and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate are all able to release Ca2+ from intracellular stores in pancreatic acinar cells and are involved in agonist-evoked responses (11Cancela J.M.

Such small water soluble messengers are highly diffusible in the cytoplasm (13Petersen O.H. Petersen C.C. Kasai H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 297-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), and it seems likely that one or more of them transmits the Ca2+ release signal from the activated basal receptor to the Ca2+ channels in the apical part of the endoplasmic reticulum store (31Ashby M.C. Tepikin A.V. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 701-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In the majority of our experiments, it was possible to trigger large [Ca2+]i transients despite the fact that only a small area of plasma membrane underwent stimulation. We estimate that the area of plasma membrane covered by the patch pipette is at most 2% of the total surface area (based upon the Ω-shaped membrane inside the pipette tip and the total cell surface estimated from our confocal images). If the distribution of the muscarinic receptors were reasonably even, this would suggest that occupancy of a relatively small proportion of the receptors is sufficient to trigger not only local but also global and even intercellular [Ca2+]i signals. The ACh-detecting system in the basal membrane must therefore be highly sensitive."
https://openalex.org/W1978326763,"Previous work demonstrates that the biosynthetic precursor of cholesterol, desmosterol, is released from cells and that its efflux to high density lipoprotein or phosphatidylcholine vesicles is greater than that of newly synthesized cholesterol (Johnson, W. J., Fischer, R. T., Phillips, M. C., and Rothblat, G. H. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 25037–25046). Here we report that the release of individual precursor sterols varies with the efflux of newly synthesized zymosterol being greater than that of lathosterol and both exceeding that of newly synthesized cholesterol when using either methyl-β-cyclodextrin or complete serum as acceptors. The transfer of newly synthesized lathosterol to methyl-β-cyclodextrin was inhibited by actin polymerization but not by Golgi disassembly whereas that of newly synthesized cholesterol was inhibited by both conditions. Newly synthesized lathosterol associated with cellular detergent-resistant membranes more rapidly than newly synthesized cholesterol. Upon efflux to serum, newly synthesized cholesterol precursors associated with both high and low density lipoproteins. Stimulation of the formation of direct endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane contacts was accompanied by enhanced efflux of newly synthesized lathosterol but not of newly synthesized cholesterol to serum acceptors. The data indicate that the efflux of cholesterol precursors differs not only from that of cholesterol but also from each other, with the more polar zymosterol being more avidly effluxed. Moreover, the results suggest that the intracellular routing of cholesterol precursors differs from that of newly synthesized cholesterol and implicates a potential role for the actin cytoskeleton and endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane contacts in the efflux of lathosterol. Previous work demonstrates that the biosynthetic precursor of cholesterol, desmosterol, is released from cells and that its efflux to high density lipoprotein or phosphatidylcholine vesicles is greater than that of newly synthesized cholesterol (Johnson, W.

Moreover, the results suggest that the intracellular routing of cholesterol precursors differs from that of newly synthesized cholesterol and implicates a potential role for the actin cytoskeleton and endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane contacts in the efflux of lathosterol. Virtually all the organs of the body synthesize cholesterol, with extrahepatic tissues accounting for a significant fraction of whole body sterol production (1Dietschy J.M. Turley S.D. Spady D.K. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1637-1659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cholesterol is synthesized from acetyl-CoA via the mevalonate pathway that initially produces farnesyl diphosphate, a precursor for squalene, dolichol, heme a, ubiquinone, and isoprenylated proteins. The committed step in cholesterol synthesis is the cyclization of squalene to lanosterol. From this compound, cholesterol is synthesized in a 19-step process involving the activity of nine different enzymes (2Risley J.M. J. Chem. Ed. 2002; 79: 377-384Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Recent data indicate that sterols regulate the pathway both at the early (i.e. via hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase) and postlanosterol steps (3Kim J.H. Lee J.N. Paik Y.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18153-18160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The late steps of cholesterol synthesis can proceed via lathosterol and 7-dehydrocholesterol or via desmosterol to cholesterol. Interestingly, the relative importance of the two pathways may shift in vivo, e.g. during aging (4Lutjohann D. Brzezinka A. Barth E. Abramowski D. Staufenbiel M. von Bergmann K. Beyreuther K. Multhaup G. Bayer T.A. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1078-1085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Cholesterol biosynthesis is critically important for human development and cannot be compensated for by increasing the uptake of cholesterol from exogenous sources. This is exemplified by an increasing number of inborn errors of metabolism that are attributed to mutations in cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes (5Nwokoro N.A. Wassif C.A. Porter F.D. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2001; 74: 105-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The prototype of these disorders, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is caused by deficiency of 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase, the last step in cholesterol synthesis via the lathosterol pathway. More recently, other multiple malformation/mental retardation syndromes, including lathosterolosis, have been characterized (6Brunetti-Pierri N. Corso G. Rossi M. Ferrari P. Balli F. Rivasi F. Annunziata I. Ballabio A. Russo A.D. Andria G. Parenti G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 71: 952-958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In these patients, cholesterol precursors may constitute up to ∼10% of total cellular and plasma sterols. Importantly, cholesterol precursors are also found in normal human plasma, at concentrations roughly 1:1000 of that of cholesterol (7Bjorkhem I. Miettinen T. Reihner E. Ewerth S. Angelin B. Einarsson K. J. Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 1137-1143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Vanhanen H.T. Blomqvist S. Ehnholm C. Hyvonen M. Jauhiainen M. Torstila I. Miettinen T.A. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1535-1544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plasma levels of lathosterol and desmosterol are commonly used as measures of the cholesterol biosynthetic activity of the individual. Recent data suggest that these values are highly heritable (9Berge K.E. von Bergmann K. Lutjohann D. Guerra R. Grundy S.M. Hobbs H.H. Cohen J.C. J.

A. 1998; 95: 1899-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Several steps of the pathway also occur in peroxisomes. However, the absence of functional peroxisomes does not lead to deficiency of cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes (16Hogenboom S. Romeijn G.J. Houten S.M. Baes M. Wanders R.J. Waterham H.R. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 90-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transfer of cholesterol from its site of synthesis in the ER to the plasma membrane and extracellular acceptors has been investigated in a number of studies (for reviews see Refs. 17Simons K. Ikonen E. Science. 2000; 290: 1721-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar and 18Maxfield F.R. Wustner D. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 891-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Instead, the transfer of sterol precursors has so far received little attention despite the pioneering observations by Lange et al. (19Lange Y. Echevarria F. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21439-21443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Johnson and co-workers (20Johnson W.J. Fischer R.T. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol.

Lange and co-workers (22Lange Y. Muraski M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4433-4436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Echevarria F. Norton R.A. Nes W.D. Lange Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8484-8489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that in fibroblasts at least three cholesterol precursors, lanosterol, zymosterol, and 7-dehydrocholesterol were highly concentrated in the plasma membrane. Moreover, newly synthesized zymosterol was found to move to the plasma membrane faster than cholesterol, with a half-time of 9 min (that of cholesterol being 18 min). In contrast, in McA-RH7777 cells the rate of transport of newly synthesized desmosterol was found to be roughly equal to that of cholesterol, with a half-time of ∼30 min for cholesterol and ∼40 min for desmosterol (24Baum C.L.

J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21439-21443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) further reported that plasma membrane zymosterol turned over rapidly by internalization and became converted to cholesterol. On the other hand, Johnson et al. (20Johnson W.J. Fischer R.T. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25037-25046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) showed that sterol precursors were not only enriched in the plasma membrane but were rapidly effluxed from cells to high density lipoprotein and phosphatidylcholine vesicles. The major biosynthetic sterol released from Chinese hamster ovary cells was reported to be desmosterol or a closely related sterol. The rapid efflux of biosynthetic desmosterol was attributed to its more efficient desorption from the plasma membrane rather than to its more efficient delivery to the plasma membrane (21Phillips J.E. Rodrigueza W.V. Johnson W.J. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 2459-2470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present work, the synthesis, intracellular partitioning, and cellular release of cholesterol and its select precursors were further studied. The efflux of sterols to both methyl-β-cyclodextrin and to serum was analyzed. We report that the faster efflux compared with newly synthesized cholesterol is observed for lathosterol, the major sterol precursor in the circulation, but in particular for zymosterol. Moreover, we provide evidence suggesting that the faster efflux of lathosterol is coupled to a cellular circuit different from that of newly synthesized cholesterol and that its release to physiological acceptors can be modulated differently from that of newly synthesized cholesterol.

Where indicated, cells were sterol-starved by maintaining in growth medium supplemented with 5% LPDS instead of complete serum for 48 h prior to [3H]acetate labeling. Analysis of Sterol Biosynthesis and Efflux to Methyl-β-cyclodextrin— Cells were grown on 55-mm dishes in LPDS-containing medium supplemented with [14C]cholesterol (20 nCi/ml) for 48 h.

For cyclodextrin extractions, the cells were incubated with 5 mm methyl-β -cyclodextrin during the last 5 min of chase in MEM supplemented with 10 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 0.35 g/liter NaHCO3, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (air medium) on a shaking water bath at 37 °C. The medium was collected, and the cells were scraped into ice-cold PBS, harvested by centrifugation, and resuspended in 2% NaCl. Aliquots of the medium and the cell suspension were analyzed by liquid scintillation counting to determine the [14C]cholesterol content. The lipids from the cells and the medium were extracted and analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC), silver ion HPLC, and liquid scintillation counting as previously described (27Heino S. Lusa S.

Efflux of Cholesterol and Biosynthetic Sterol Intermediates to Serum—Cells were grown on 55-mm dishes in LPDS-containing medium supplemented with [14C]cholesterol (20 nCi/ml) for 48 h. The cells were then washed with PBS, labeled with [3H]acetate in experiment medium (250 μCi/ml) for 5 or 15 min at 37 °C and chased for 30 min to 4 h in experiment medium containing 20% human serum, 10 μm lovastatin, and 25 mm mevalonate at 37 °C. The medium and the cells were collected as above, and aliquots of both were analyzed by liquid scintillation counting to determine the [14C]cholesterol content. Lipids from the medium and cells were extracted and separated by TLC and HPLC. Notably, as various [3H]acetate-derived cellular products were released to serum, the medium was analyzed by TLC prior to HPLC. The procedural losses were corrected for based on the recovery of the [14C]cholesterol label as in Ref. 27Heino S. Lusa S. Somerharju P. Ehnholm C. Olkkonen V.M. Ikonen E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Where indicated, the serum-containing chase medium was supplemented with 0.8-μm diameter latex beads (1:10 dilution of a 10% bead suspension). Analysis of Albumin Secretion—Confluent HuH7 cultures in 25-mm diameter wells were preincubated with Met- and Cys-free MEM supplemented with 10 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 0.35 g/liter NaHCO3, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were then pulse-labeled for 10 min with [35S]Met/Cys labeling mixture (100 μCi/ml). Chase was performed in 1 ml of serum-free culture medium containing 10-fold excess of unlabeled Met and Cys and 20 μg/ml cycloheximide. Where indicated jasplakinolide (3 μm) was present during the preincubation, pulse and chase. The dishes were then placed on ice, and the medium was collected. The cells were washed with PBS, lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, and 25 μg/ml each of chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The medium and cell lysates were then incubated with anti-albumin antibodies for 16 h at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were captured by protein A-Sepharose (2 h at 4 °C), and the bound material was washed five times with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 2 mm EDTA. The proteins were boiled in reducing Laemmli sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE (8% gels), and the albumin bands quantitated by Fujifilm BAS-1500 Imaging system. Triton X-100 Extraction—HuH7 cells were labeled with [14C]cholesterol for 48 h and with [3H]acetate for 5 min, and chased for 5–60 min as described above. The cells were washed and scraped in ice-cold PBS, harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 1% Triton X-100-containing buffer on ice, and fractionated in 0–40% Optiprep flotation gradient in the presence of 1% Triton X-100 as described previously (27Heino S.

Six fractions were collected from the top, and the lipids extracted and analyzed as above. Size-exclusion Chromatography—Serum lipoproteins were fractionated using Superose 6HR column (Amersham Biosciences) with PBS as elution buffer. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min and 1-min fractions were collected. One-tenth of each fraction was used to determine the [3H]acetate-derived and [14C]cholesterol radioactivity. The major peaks of [3H]acetate-derived radioctivity were pooled, and lipids extracted and analyzed by TLC followed by HPLC as above to resolve the biosynthetic sterols. Procedural losses were corrected based on the recovery of [14C]cholesterol. Other Methods—Protein concentrations were measured according to Lowry (28Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Statistical significance of differences was determined using the Student's t test. Analysis of Cholesterol and Its Biosynthetic Precursors in Cell Lines—Newly synthesized cholesterol is often resolved only by TLC although this method is inadequate to separate cholesterol from its biosynthetic precursors as reported in several studies (20Johnson W.J.

Slotte J.P. Bierman E.L. Oram J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25343-25349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate the resolving power of TLC, we pulse-labeled sterol-starved BHK cells with [3H]acetate for 15 min, chased for increasing times in the presence of lovastatin and excess unlabeled mevalonate (to stop further [3H]acetate incorporation into sterols), and analyzed the extracted lipids by TLC. The cholesterol TLC spot was then analyzed by silver ion HPLC and the fraction of [3H]cholesterol plotted. As shown in Fig. 1a, the fraction of [3H]cholesterol increased with increasing chase time but most of the [3H] radioactivity in the TLC cholesterol spot was actually not cholesterol. The result is in line with that reported by Johnson et al. (20Johnson W.J. Fischer R.T. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25037-25046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) using CHO cells and a longer [3H]acetate labeling time. Prolonged incubation at 14 °C during [3H]acetate labeling has been used to accumulate newly synthesized cholesterol intracellularly prior to chasing at 37 °C (26Uittenbogaard A. Ying Y. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6525-6532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 31Smart E.J. Ying Y. Donzell W.C. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29427-29435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Therefore, the fraction of cholesterol present in the TLC spot was also monitored under these conditions. At chase times under 30 min when cholesterol was postulated to undergo rapid movement, less than 50% of the TLC spot represented [3H]cholesterol (Fig. 1b). According to HPLC analysis, [3H]lathosterol was one of the major [3H]acetate-derived products co-migrating in the TLC spot, representing 35% of the dpms analyzed at 0–10 min and 25% at 30 min of chase (data not shown). The result suggests that the use of TLC alone could yield misleading results and reinforces the necessity of using methods with high resolving ability for accurate separation of cellular sterols. Next, the levels of [3H]acetate-derived newly synthesized cholesterol and its biosynthetic precursor sterols were measured by HPLC from fibroblastic (BHK and NIH3T3) and hepatic (HuH7) cell lines. Prior to [3H]acetate labeling, the cells were sterol-starved by culturing for 2 days in lipoprotein-deficient medium. The cells were pulse-labeled with [3H]acetate for 15 min and chased for 30 or 60 min. Both the rate and efficiency of [3H]acetate incorporation into cholesterol varied considerably between similarly cultured cells (Fig. 2). HuH7 and NIH3T3 cells produced [3H]cholesterol more efficiently than BHK cells that were slower in synthesizing cholesterol and contained larger fractions of the precursor sterols. In BHK cells, [3H]zymosterol represented the major sterol peak by HPLC analysis both at 30 and 60 min of chase (Fig. 2, a and b). BHK cells also contained significant levels of both [3H]lathosterol and [3H]desmosterol, whereas in HuH7 and NIH3T3 cells, lathosterol represented the major precursor sterol, and only minor amounts of desmosterol were detected (Fig. 2b). The results in HuH7 cells are in line with those obtained in another hepatic cell line, HepG2, with cholesterol as the main biosynthetic sterol product (20Johnson W.J. Fischer R.T. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25037-25046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). On the other hand, some fibroblastic cells synthesize cholesterol efficiently while others do not, as exemplified by NIH3T3 and BHK cells, respectively. Efflux of Cholesterol and Its Biosynthetic Precursors to Methyl-β-cyclodextrin—To examine the efflux of newly synthesized sterols, the release of [3H]acetate-derived sterols to methyl-β-cyclodextrin was analyzed from BHK and HuH7 cells after increasing chase times. For HuH7 cells, the [3H]acetate labeling was shortened to 5 min to increase the proportion of radiolabeled precursor sterols. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin was added to the cells for 5 min at 37 °C either immediately after the labeling or after increasing chase times in serum-free medium (in the presence of statin and unlabeled mevalonate). The cyclodextrin concentration was titrated such that the efflux of prelabeled cellular [14C]cholesterol was ∼25%. The efflux of [3H]cholesterol increased gradually with increasing chase times in both cell lines, being somewhat faster in HuH7 than in BHK cells as shown previously (27Heino S. Lusa S. Somerharju P. Ehnholm C. Olkkonen V.M. Ikonen E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8375-8380Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3a). In both cell lines, the efflux of newly synthesized [3H]lathosterol was greater than that of newly synthesized [3H]cholesterol at all time points analyzed (Fig. 3a). In BHK cells, the major precursor [3H]zymosterol was very efficiently recovered by cyclodextrin and was virtually absent from the cells, yielding a very high efflux percentage (82.4 ± 0.3% at 5 min, 80.5 ± 1.0% at 60 min, and 52.8 ± 2.39% at 120 min of chase). Accordingly, when the dpms of 3H-labeled sterols in the medium were plotted in BHK cells the overwhelming majority represented zymosterol at short chase times (5–60 min) (Fig. 3b). By contrast, [3H]desmosterol was least readily effluxed of the BHK cell sterol precursors, the [3H]desmosterol efflux percentage being intermediary between [3H]cholesterol and [3H]lathosterol (Fig. 3a). The more efficient completion of cholesterol biosynthesis in HuH7 cells was paralleled by the release of fewer precursors and correspondingly more of newly synthesized cholesterol to the acceptor (Fig. 3b). We have previously shown that the efflux of newly synthesized cholesterol to cyclodextrin is moderately inhibited in both BHK and HuH7 cells by BFA (27Heino S. Lusa S. Somerharju P. Ehnholm C. Olkkonen V.M. Ikonen E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8375-8380Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). However, we now observed that BFA had no effect on the cyclodextrin availability of newly synthesized lathosterol under the same conditions (Fig. 4, a and b). In search of additional modulators of newly synthesized sterol efflux we tested the effect of a membrane-permeant promoter of actin polymerization, the marine sponge toxin, jasplakinolide. We found that this compound inhibited slightly but reproducibly the efflux of both newly synthesized cholesterol and lathosterol (Fig. 4, a and b). Interestingly, for newly synthesized cholesterol the effect was apparently additive with that of BFA, suggesting that jasplakinolide affected a Golgi-bypass route of cholesterol transport (Fig. 4a). This was also in line with the observation that the jasplakinolide treatment had no effect on albumin secretion from the cells (Fig. 4c). The combination of BFA and jasplakinolide was not significantly more effective than jasplakinolide alone in inhibiting the efflux of lathosterol (Fig. 4b). Similar inhibition by jasplakinolide on the efflux of newly synthesized lathosterol to methyl-β-cyclodextrin was observed in BHK cells (data not shown). Association of Newly Synthesized Lathosterol with Detergent-resistant Membranes—Next, the association of newly synthesized lathosterol and cholesterol with detergent-resistant membrane fractions (DRMs) was compared. We have earlier shown that newly synthesized cholesterol was initially found in Triton X-100 soluble membranes but upon chasing, gradually associated with DRMs, kinetically closely paralleling its availability for efflux to cyclodextrin (27Heino S. Lusa S. Somerharju P. Ehnholm C. Olkkonen V.M. Ikonen E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8375-8380Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). We now observed that newly synthesized lathosterol acquired detergent resistance more rapidly than newly synthesized cholesterol in the same cells, with 35–40% found in DRMs already at 5 min of chase while at that time point, only ∼20% of newly synthesized cholesterol was detergent resistant (Fig. 5). At 15 min of chase, the difference between the detergent resistance of newly synthesized lathosterol and cholesterol was still considerable (50–55% and 30–35% in DRMs, respectively; Fig. 5c) but started to level off at longer chase times (Fig. 5b).

To investigate the mechanism and specificity of heme attachment to CcmE, we have mutated the conserved histidine 130 of a soluble C-terminally His-tagged version of CcmE (CcmEsol-C-His6) from Escherichia coli to alanine or cysteine. Remarkably, covalent bond formation with heme occurs with the protein carrying the cysteine mutation, and the process occurs both in vivo and in vitro. The yield of holo-H130C CcmEsol-C-His6 produced in vivo is low compared with the wild type. In vitro heme attachment occurs only under reducing conditions. We demonstrate the involvement of one of the heme vinyl groups and a side chain at residue 130 in the bond formation by showing that in vitro attachment does not occur either with the heme analogue mesoheme or when alanine is present at residue 130. These results have implications for the mechanism of heme attachment to the histidine of CcmE. In vitro, CcmEsol lacking a His tag binds 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulphonate and heme, the latter both noncovalently and via a covalent bond from the histidine side chain, similarly to the tagged proteins, thus countering a recent proposal that the His tag causes the heme binding. However, the His tag does appear to enhance the rate of in vitro covalent heme binding and to affect the heme ligation in the ferric b-type cytochrome form. Cytochrome c maturation in the periplasms of many bacteria requires the heme chaperone CcmE, which binds heme covalently both in vivo and in vitro via a histidine residue before transferring the heme to apocytochromes c.

However, the His tag does appear to enhance the rate of in vitro covalent heme binding and to affect the heme ligation in the ferric b-type cytochrome form. c-type cytochromes are important ubiquitous proteins that bind heme covalently via two thioether bonds between the cysteines in a conserved CXXCH motif in the protein and the vinyl groups of heme. In many Gram-negative bacteria, formation of these covalent bonds occurs in the periplasm in a multistep process involving the so-called Ccm (cytochrome cmaturation) proteins A–H, all of which are essential (1Thöny-Meyer L. Fischer F. Kunzler P. Ritz D. Hennecke H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4321-4326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Thöny-Meyer L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The apocytochromes are synthesized in the cytoplasm and transported to the periplasm via the Sec pathway (3Thöny-Meyer L. Kunzler P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 794-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which heme, which is also synthesized cytoplasmically, is transported to the periplasm is as yet uncertain (4Goldman B.S. Beck D.L. Monika E.M. Kranz R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5003-5008Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 5Schulz H. Fabianek R.A. Pellicioli E.C. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, it has been shown that the membrane-bound protein CcmC is required for presentation of heme to the membrane-anchored periplasmic protein CcmE (7Ren Q. Thöny-Meyer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32591-32596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). CcmE has been identified as the heme chaperone and binds heme covalently via a conserved histidine residue (His130 in Escherichia coli) before transferring the heme to apocytochromes (8Schulz H. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. Science. 1998; 281: 1197-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Recently, structures of the CcmE apoproteins from two different bacterial species have been reported (9Arnesano F. Banci L. Barker P.D. Bertini I. Rosato A. Su X.C. Viezzoli M.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13587-13594Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 10Enggist E. Thöny-Meyer L. Guntert P. Pervushin K. Structure. 2002; 10: 1551-1557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), which shows that the heme-binding histidine is exposed on the protein surface but provides no clue as to the unusual properties of this residue. CcmE has been shown to be part of a complex with CcmF in vivo (11Ren Q. Ahuja U. Thöny-Meyer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7657-7663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), which together with CcmH forms what is proposed to be a bacterial heme lyase. CcmH interacts with CcmG, which is part of the system that provides reductant to the periplasm, specifically for reducing the cysteines in the CXXCH motif of the apocytochromes (12Reid E. Cole J. Eaves D.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The nature of the novel bond between the histidine of CcmE and the heme remains unknown, although it has been shown that one of the vinyl groups of heme is involved (13Daltrop O. Stevens J.M. Higham C.W. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9703-9708Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). CcmE has been identified in a number of bacteria as well as in Arabidopsis and presumably other plant mitochondria (14Spielewoy N. Schulz H. Grienenberger J.M. Thöny-Meyer L. Bonnard G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5491-5497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In vitro studies of a soluble version of CcmE (CcmE′) have shown that the covalent attachment occurs under reducing conditions and that release of the heme to apocytochromes will only occur if heme is in its ferrous state (13Daltrop O. Stevens J.M. Higham C.W. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9703-9708Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To probe further the covalent attachment of heme in vitro or in vivo, we have altered by site-directed mutagenesis the histidine 130 that has been shown previously to be the site of heme attachment in vivo (8Schulz H. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. Science. 1998; 281: 1197-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Replacement of this histidine by cysteine or alanine was expected to generate proteins with either a potentially reactive or an unreactive side chain at position 130. The CcmE′ protein used in previous in vitro studies (13Daltrop O. Stevens J.M. Higham C.W. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9703-9708Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) had a His tag at the C terminus. Very recently it has been suggested that such a His tag may significantly influence the binding of heme to CcmE′ in vitro to the extent that protein from Shewanella putrefaciens lacking a tag is reported to be unable to bind heme in vitro (9Arnesano F. Banci L. Barker P.D. Bertini I. Rosato A. Su X.C. Viezzoli M.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13587-13594Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Any possibility that a His tag might direct heme to form a nonphysiological covalent bond to other than residue 130 would also be addressed by the present mutagenesis studies. Further test of whether a His tag affects the binding of heme has been made by comparing the tagged and untagged proteins with histidine at 130. Furthermore, the mechanistic implications of our studies are discussed. Plasmid Construction and Mutagenesis—E. coli strain DH5α was used for cloning, and JM109(DE3) was used for protein expression. The expression vector for CcmEsol-C-His6 (CcmE′) was constructed as described (13Daltrop O. Stevens J.M. Higham C.W. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9703-9708Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and produces the soluble periplasmic region of the protein from Ser32 with a cleavable pelB signal sequence for periplasmic targeting of the protein. Amino acid substitutions in this expression vector were performed using the ExSite PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene) using the primers pET22bH130AF and -R for the H130A mutant and pET22bH130CF and -R for the H130C mutant (as listed in Table I). The vector for the cytoplasmic expression of the thrombin-cleavable His-tagged version of the protein (N-His6-CcmEsol) was constructed by PCR amplification of the gene from the plasmid pEC86 (which was kindly provided by L. Thöny-Meyer) using the primers pET15bF and -R, which include XhoI and BamHI restriction sites, respectively (Table I). The PCR products were cloned into the vector pET15-b (Novagen) using these restriction sites, producing the plasmid pE151.

The mutations made were H130A using the primers pET15bH130AF and -R, H130C using the primers pET15bH130CF and -R, as well as mutation of the His and Met (both to Ala) that remain on the protein following thrombin cleavage, using the primers pET15bHMAAF and -R (Table I).

Schulz H. Zufferey R. Kunzler P. Thöny-Meyer L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), which expresses the Ccm proteins A–H. Co-expression of these proteins is essential for production of wild-type holo-CcmE′ (13Daltrop O. Stevens J.M. Higham C.W. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9703-9708Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). High levels of the apoproteins were expressed in the periplasm in the absence of pEC86. E. coli cultures were grown as described previously, and the proteins were purified using Ni2+-chelating Sepharose columns equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, as described (13Daltrop O. Stevens J.M. Higham C.W. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9703-9708Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmically expressed proteins (from the plasmids pE151, pE152, pE153, and pE154) were purified in the same way, except that the cells were sonicated on ice three times for 30 s to prepare the cell extracts, and the buffer contained 300 mm NaCl throughout. Thrombin cleavage of N-His6-CcmEsol and mutants thereof was performed using a thrombin CleanCleave Kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Uncleaved protein was removed by re-applying the reaction mixture to the Ni2+-Sepharose column. Western blots were performed using a peroxidase conjugate of a monoclonal anti-polyhistidine antibody (Sigma) to confirm that the His tags had been completely cleaved. Protein Characterization—Discontinuous SDS-PAGE (15 or 17.5% acrylamide) (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar) was used to analyze the proteins, and staining for covalently bound heme was performed according to the method of Goodhew et al. (17Goodhew C.F. Brown K.R. Pettigrew G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 852: 288-294Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar), following acidified acetone extraction to remove noncovalently bound heme. Visible absorption spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 2 spectrophotometer using between 2 and 5 μm heme-protein samples in either 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, or 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl. Pyridine hemochrome spectra were obtained according to the method of Bartsch (18Bartsch R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 23: 344-363Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar) using 5 μm protein in 19% (v/v) pyridine and 0.15 m NaOH. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ES-MS) 1The abbreviations used are: ES-MS, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; ANS, 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate. was performed using a Micromass Bio-Q II-ZS triple quadrupole atmospheric pressure mass spectrometer. 10-μl protein samples in 1:1 water:acetonitrile, 1% formic acid at a concentration of 20 pmol/μl were injected into the electrospray source at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. Heme Addition—Hemin (Sigma) or mesoheme (Frontier Science) (1 mm in Me2SO) was added to apoprotein solutions in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Quantitative loading of the proteins with heme was achieved by incubating 1 equivalent of protein with 1.1 equivalents of heme at room temperature. Desalting columns were used to remove excess heme from the protein solutions. Disodium dithionite (Sigma) was used to reduce heme. The fluorescence measurements were made using a Perkin Elmer LS 50B fluorimeter, and the dissociation constants for heme and ANS were determined as described (13Daltrop O. Stevens J.M. Higham C.W. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9703-9708Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Covalent Heme Attachment—Disodium dithionite and dithiothreitol (5 mm) were added to solutions (in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0) containing protein (50 μm) and heme (10 μm; added from 1 mm stocks in Me2SO), which were incubated at room temperature. The solutions were deoxygenated by thoroughly sparging with humidified argon. The reactions were carried out in the dark. Characterization of CcmEsol Lacking a His Tag—Recently, it was suggested that the His tag on a soluble CcmE construct, described in our previous work (13Daltrop O. Stevens J.M. Higham C.W. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9703-9708Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), causes artifactual noncovalent binding of heme and that the heme binding described is nonphysiological (9Arnesano F. Banci L. Barker P.D. Bertini I. Rosato A. Su X.C. Viezzoli M.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13587-13594Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To address this point, we have made a construct of CcmE that can be studied with and without the His tag, using a protease cleavage site between the His tag and the soluble CcmE domain. The protein with the cleavable His tag (N-His6-CcmEsol) was analyzed by ES-MS and had a mass of 16,641 Da (theoretical mass, 16,641 Da); the protein ran as a single band during SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1, lane 1). After thrombin treatment and removal of uncleaved protein, the cleaved protein (CcmEsol) had a mass of 14,890 Da (theoretical mass, 14,890). The difference in the mass of the protein could also be seen by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1, lane 4). The absence of the His tag was also confirmed by Western blotting. After the addition of ferric heme to apoprotein lacking a His tag, followed by reduction by disodium dithionite, no differences in the visible spectra, characteristic of a low spin state, were observed compared with the His tag-containing protein (Table II). There was a subsequent disappearance of these spectral characteristics upon reduction, as we have observed for the wild-type protein with the C-terminal His tag (13Daltrop O. Stevens J.M. Higham C.W. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9703-9708Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the visible spectrum of ferric heme and CcmEsol, a species was obtained that is similar to that observed upon the addition of ferric heme to horse heart apocytochrome c (19Dumont M.E. Corin A.F. Campbell G.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7368-7378Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), showing features of a high spin heme-protein species. Thus, the spectrum of the oxidized heme-protein complex obtained without a His tag (a broad Soret band around 400 nm) was different from those for the proteins with the His tag at either the C or N terminus, both of which have a Soret band at 413 nm. These data suggest that the His tag can affect the coordination chemistry of the ferric heme-CcmEsol complex leading to a high spin/low spin equilibrium. However, in light of the known effects of polyhistidine on the coordination characteristics of heme, this is arguably not surprising (20Tohjo M. Shibata K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1963; 103: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This contrasts with the spectrum of the reduced heme-CcmEsol complex not being altered by the absence of the His tag (Table II).Table IIVisible absorption maxima for various forms of CcmEsolNature of heme-CcmEsol complexAbsorption maximaFerrous oxidation statePyridine hemochrome (α band)nmnmWild typeaRef. 13.b-type heme-CcmEsol-C-His6560530425556H130Mesoheme-CcmEsol-C-His6549521412546In vivo holo-CcmEsol-C-His6555526421551b-type heme-CcmEsol560530426556H130Ab-type heme-CcmEsol-C-His6NDNDND556Mesoheme-CcmEsol-C-His6549521410546H130Cb-type heme-CcmEsol-C-His6560530425556Mesoheme-CcmEsol-C-His6550522411546In vivo holo-CcmEsol-C-His6555525419∼552In vitro holo-CcmEsol556526423552.5a Ref. 13Daltrop O.

Open table in a new tab In addition, further analysis of the protein without the His tag showed that it has a similar ANS affinity to the protein with the tag and the same maximum emission wavelength at 480 nm (results not shown). Also, it was possible to displace bound ANS from CcmEsol by the addition of heme, as we have shown for the tagged protein (13Daltrop O. Stevens J.M. Higham C.W. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9703-9708Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The reaction of ferrous heme with N-His6-CcmEsol led to a protein with covalently bound heme that had characteristics indistinguishable from CcmEsol-C-His6 (13Daltrop O. Stevens J.M. Higham C.W. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9703-9708Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, lane 2, and data not shown). After thrombin cleavage of the His tag, heme was shown to be covalently bound to CcmEsol as shown in Fig. 1 (lane 3). Reaction of CcmEsol with heme in the absence of the His tag led to the same qualitative result (Fig. 1, lane 5), but the half-life of reaction was increased by at least 10-fold relative to versions of the protein with His tags at either end. Following thrombin cleavage of the protein expressed from pET15-b, two potential extra heme-ligating residues remain on the N terminus of the protein, namely histidine and methionine. To avoid any potential artifactual heme ligation by the untagged protein obtained by thrombin treatment of the N-terminal His-tagged protein, these residues were mutated to alanines. The proteins with and without the His tag were pure as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis (data not shown) and had the expected masses as indicated by ES-MS analysis. Upon the addition of ferric heme to apoprotein without the His tag, the spectrum changed compared with the spectrum of free ferric heme (Fig. 2). The heme-protein complex appeared to be high spin in the ferric state and switched to low spin in the reduced state upon the addition of disodium dithionite (Fig. 2). Therefore, the presence of an extra methionine and histidine, derived from the linker region, had no observable effect on interactions with heme. Characterization of the Mutants H130A and H130C—Both the H130A and H130C variants of CcmEsol-C-His6 were expressed well as their apoforms in the E. coli periplasm. The masses of the proteins were confirmed by ES-MS, which also showed that the periplasmic targeting sequences had been completely cleaved. The observed masses were 15,447 Da for the H130A mutant (theoretical mass, 15,450 Da) and 15,483 Da for the H130C mutant (theoretical mass, 15,482 Da). Both proteins were also expressed in E. coli with co-expression of the other Ccm proteins, and the covalent attachment of heme to the proteins was examined by SDS-PAGE analysis followed by heme staining (Fig. 3). Fig. 3A shows that the proteins were purified to homogeneity (lanes 2 and 4 for H130A and H130C, respectively). As expected, the H130A mutant did not appear to bind heme covalently in vivo as judged by heme staining of the SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 3B, lane 2), which is in agreement with previous experiments (8Schulz H. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. Science. 1998; 281: 1197-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The H130C mutant, however, was found to heme stain when expressed with the other Ccm proteins (Fig. 3B, lane 6), indicating that the protein was recognized to some extent by the Ccm system for heme delivery and attachment. To detect the stain from covalently bound heme, the gel had to be overloaded such that a broad band was seen. It was found that the apo-H130C protein formed intermolecular disulfide bonds in vitro when dialyzed extensively against oxygenated 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, as shown in Fig. 3A (lane 5). This observation was supported by analysis with Ellman's reagent, which showed 1 and 0.2 equivalents of free thiol for reduced and oxidized protein, respectively. A significant proportion of the protein ran at a molecular mass of ∼30 kDa, corresponding to a covalently linked dimer, which was also identified by ES-MS analysis. In vivo-produced H130C holo-CcmEsol-C-His6 is produced at a very low level, where less than 0.5% of the protein is in the holo-form containing covalently bound heme, as determined from the relative ratio of the Soret band to the absorption at 280 nm. In Vitro Heme Binding to the H130A and H130C Apoproteins—Upon the addition of ferric heme to the mutant CcmEsol-C-His6, both H130A and H130C formed noncovalent b-type cytochrome complexes, as determined by visible spectroscopy. The complexes formed within the mixing time and appeared to be stable in this form for several hours. The absorbance maxima for the complexes of both proteins with ferrous heme and mesoheme as well as the pyridine hemochrome spectra are shown in Table II. Mesoheme is a heme analogue that has ethyl substituents in the normal positions of the vinyl groups. The visible spectrum of the complex of H130C with ferric heme shows the characteristics of a b-type cytochrome, with an α-band at 560 nm following reduction with dithionite and immediate recording of the spectrum. Interestingly, it was not possible to record an accurate visible spectrum of the dithionite-reduced H130A mutant b-type complex because dissociation of heme from the protein was too rapid. Heme dissociation upon reduction was also observed with the wild-type heme-protein complex (13Daltrop O. Stevens J.M. Higham C.W. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9703-9708Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The pyridine hemochrome spectra of the b-type complexes of both mutants with heme have absorbance maxima at 556 nm, which is characteristic of unsaturated vinyl groups and shows that covalent attachment does not occur under these conditions. The dissociation constants (Kd) of the mutant proteins for ferric heme were measured by fluorescence spectroscopy as described for the wild-type protein (13Daltrop O. Stevens J.M. Higham C.W. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9703-9708Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The dissociation constants of the high affinity binding sites were compared, because these are likely to be the physiologically relevant sites. The Kd of the H130A mutant was found to be 0.72 (± 0.16) μm, which shows that it has a slightly lower affinity for heme than the wild-type protein (Kd, 0.2 μm (13Daltrop O. Stevens J.M. Higham C.W. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9703-9708Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar)). This result is not unexpected because the loss of the histidine side chain is likely to have changed the conformation of the heme-binding site in the protein. The Kd of the H130C mutant was found to be 0.48 ± 0.08 μm, also higher than the wild type. Both mutant proteins, however, have retained a significant affinity for heme. It should be noted, however, that the model of heme binding presented for this protein suggests that a conformational change occurs in the flexible C-terminal region upon heme binding (10Enggist E. Thöny-Meyer L. Guntert P. Pervushin K. Structure. 2002; 10: 1551-1557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Covalent Attachment of Heme to H130C—Upon reduction by disodium dithionite of the C-terminal His-tagged b-type H130C variant protein, with a 5-fold excess of protein over heme, the absorbance spectrum shifted toward a cytochrome spectrum corresponding to a covalent bond between heme and protein. The α-band shifted from 560 to 556 nm over several hours, and the β-band and Soret band also shifted accordingly with time (Table II). After desalting the reaction mixture, the spectrum of H130C produced in this way was very similar to the spectrum of the in vivo-produced H130C protein (Table II). The pyridine hemochrome spectrum of the in vitro produced holo-form of the protein yielded a maximum around 553 nm, which is consistent with the presence of a single free vinyl group, as has been observed for single cysteine variants of c-type cytochromes (21Tomlinson E.J. Ferguson S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32530-32534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the in vivo produced holo-form of this mutant had broad absorption maxima in the reduced and pyridine hemochrome spectra. This observation suggests that as a consequence of the substitution of histidine 130 with a cysteine residue, heme attachment is not completely selective and that the formation of incorrect side products can occur. The oxidation state of heme and the cysteine thiol in vivo might not be as tightly controlled during the periplasmic attachment of heme to the protein compared with the reducing conditions of the in vitro experiments. To prove that the spectroscopic data were indicative of in vivo and in vitro covalent bond formation between heme and the H130C mutant protein, SDS-PAGE analysis followed by heme staining was performed. Fig. 3 (lane 8) shows the reaction of the b-type complex of heme and H130C with dithionite after 14 h. The fact that the protein stains for covalently bound heme (Fig. 3B, lane 8), as does the in vivo produced holo-H130C in lane 6, indicates that in vitro and in vivo covalent attachment of heme to the protein had occurred. The controls for this experiment are shown in lanes 3, 7, and 9. These are H130A incubated with ferric heme followed by reduction with dithionite, H130C incubated with ferric heme, and the addition of ferric mesoheme to H130C protein followed by reduction with dithionite and incubation for 14 h, respectively. These controls show that covalent attachment of heme to the CcmEsol protein samples did not occur under these conditions, because no heme staining could be observed for CcmEsol. The results establish that one of the vinyl groups of heme is involved in formation of the covalent bond, because attachment was not observed with mesoheme. The results also show that the bond forms with the cysteine residue of the protein, because it is not observed with the alanine mutant. Therefore, it is shown that covalent heme binding can only occur with a reactive side chain of amino acid 130. As was observed for the wild-type protein (13Daltrop O. Stevens J.M. Higham C.W. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9703-9708Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), these results also highlight the requirement for reduction of the heme in the covalent bond formation, because no heme staining was observed with the oxidized sample. To remove any ambiguity regarding the effect of the His tag on the covalent heme attachment to the H130C variant and the inability of the H130A mutant to bind heme covalently in vitro, proteins with these active site mutations were also made with a N-terminal cleavable His tag. The purified proteins were shown to be pure by SDS-PAGE analysis as shown in Fig. 4 (la"

Charged amino acids are strongly conserved in the ligand-binding domain of these receptor proteins. To investigate the role of particular residues in ligand binding of the serotonin 5-HT3AS receptor (5-HT3R), glutamate amino acid residues at three different positions, Glu97, Glu224, and Glu235, in the extracellular N-terminal domain were substituted with aspartate and glutamine using site-directed mutagenesis. Wild type and mutant receptor proteins were expressed in HEK293 cells and analyzed by electrophysiology, radioligand binding, fluorescence measurements, and immunochemistry. A structural model of the ligand-binding domain of the 5-HT3R based on the acetylcholine binding protein revealed the position of the mutated amino acids. Our results demonstrate that mutations of Glu97, distant from the ligand-binding site, had little effect on the receptor, whereas mutations Glu224 and Glu235, close to the predicted binding site, are indeed important for ligand binding. Mutations E224Q, E224D, and E235Q decreased EC50 and Kd values 5–20-fold, whereas E235D was functionally expressed at a low level and had a more than 100-fold increased EC50 value. Comparison of the fluorescence properties of a fluorescein-labeled antagonist upon binding to wild type 5-HT3R and E235Q, allowed us to localize Glu235 within a distance of 1 nm around the ligand-binding site, as proposed by our model.

The question of how ligand binding to certain receptor proteins eventually gates ion channels is of central importance in cellular signaling but still unresolved at a molecular level. In order to enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms, we used a combined biomolecular and biophysical approach to study a serotonin-gated ion channel. The 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT 1The abbreviations used are: 5-HT, serotonin; 5-HT3R, serotonin 5-HT3A receptor; AChBP, acetylcholine-binding protein; C12E9, monododecyl nonaethylene-glycol; GR65630, 3-(5-methyl-1H-imidazol-4-yl)-1-(1-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-propanone; GR-flu, 1,2,3,9-tetrahydro-3-[(5-methyl-1H-imidazol-4-yl)methyl]-9-(3-amino-(N-fluorescein-thiocarbamoyl)-propyl)-4H-carbazol-4-one; mCPBG, m-chlorophenylbiguanide; nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; WT, wild type. ; serotonin) type 3 receptor (5-HT3 receptor (5-HT3R)) is the only ligand-gated ion channel found among the serotonin receptors. Its gene structure (1Werner P. Kawashima E. Reid J. Hussy N. Lundstrom K. Buell G. Humbert Y. Jones K.A. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 26: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and amino acid sequence are similar to those of other members of the Cys loop receptor family including the nicotinic acetylcholine (nAChR), ionotropic γ-aminobutyric acid, and glycine receptors. They are composed of five homologous or identical subunits, each comprising four predicted transmembrane regions and a large extracellular N-terminal domain containing the ligand-binding site. Among them, the nAChR is most closely related to the 5-HT3 receptor. Both receptors form ion channels that are permeable to cations and share about 20–30% amino acid sequence identity. So far, three different 5-HT3 receptor subunits, A, B, and C, have been cloned as well as a short splicing variant of the A subunit. Expression of only A subunits results in functional ion channels of similar properties as for 5-HT3 receptors in native tissues, suggesting that this receptor is active as a homopentamer (2Maricq A.V. Peterson A.S. Brake A.J. Myers R.M. Julius D. Science. 1991; 254: 432-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). Expression of solely the B (3Davies P.A. Pistis M. Hanna M.C. Peters J.A.

Site-directed mutagenesis and biochemical studies, combined with amino acid sequence alignments, have identified amino acid residues and sequence regions (the so-called loops A–F; see Fig. 1) in the N-terminal extracellular domain implicated in the ligand-binding site of the nicotinic acetylcholine and 5-HT3 receptors (for reviews, see Refs. 5Karlin A.

For the nAChR, these experiments together with the recently resolved three-dimensional structure of the acetylcholine-binding protein (AChBP) (8Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V.

Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar) indicate that the binding site is located at the interface between two adjacent subunits and that the binding loops A–F are forming the binding pocket. According to this model, loops A–C would form the binding site on one subunit, whereas loops D–F of the adjacent subunit would contribute to a lesser extent to ligand binding. In the case of the 5-HT3 receptor, only few details are known about the ligand-binding site. Published data indicate that certain residues, especially in loops C and D (see Fig. 1A), are important for ligand binding. In earlier work from our group, the binding of a fluorescein-labeled, high affinity competitive antagonist 1,2,3,9-tetrahydro-3-[(5-methyl-1H-imidazol-4-yl)methyl]-9-(3-amino-(N-fluorescein-thiocarbamoyl)-propyl)-4H-carbazol-4-one (GR-flu) to the 5-HT3 receptor has been characterized by steady state (9Tairi A.P.

ChemBioChem. 2001; 2: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) fluorescence spectroscopy. These studies indicated that receptor-bound GR-flu senses a local environment, which is ∼0.8 pH units more acidic than the bulk, suggesting that acidic residues, glutamate or aspartate, are located close to the binding site of GR-flu. Recently, Glu128 has been shown to participate in the binding of ligands to the 5-HT3 receptor, since mutations of this residue strongly affected ligand binding and channel activation (12Boess F.G. Steward L.J. Steele J.A. Liu D. Reid J. Glencorse T.A. Martin I.L. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this residue is conserved in all primary sequences of both subunits, A and B, of the 5-HT3 receptor and is located in a primary sequence region corresponding to loop A (Fig. 1), shown to be important for ligand binding in the nicotinic acetylcholine and 5-HT3 receptors (12Boess F.G.

Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1249-1255PubMed Google Scholar). The negatively charged glutamates at the binding sites were proposed to interact with the positively charged nitrogen atoms in high affinity ligands for the 5-HT3 receptor. However, using nonnatural amino acids, it was shown that Trp182 of the 5-HT3 receptor forms a cation-π binding with the amino group of 5-HT (17Beene D.L. Brandt G.S. Zhong W. Zacharias N.M. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10262-10269Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Moreover, other acidic residues might be implicated in ligand binding. In nAChR, δAsp180 and δGlu189 of mouse (18Czajkowski C. Kaufmann C. Karlin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6285-6289Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and αAsp200 of Torpedo (19O'Leary M.E. White M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8360-8365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been shown to play a role in ligand binding. These residues are conserved in all known 5-HT3 receptor subunit A sequences, corresponding to Asp203, Glu212, and Glu235, respectively. However, the exact role of acidic residues in the binding of ligand to the 5-HT3 receptor is not clear, because chemical modification of these residues resulted only in a slight inhibition of radioligand binding (20Miquel M.C. Emerit M.B. Gozlan H. Hamon M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 1453-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In this paper, we investigate the role of glutamate residues in ligand binding to the mouse subunit A of 5-HT3 receptor, hereafter denominated as 5-HT3R, at three different positions, Glu97, Glu224, and Glu235, by replacing them with glutamine and aspartate using site-directed mutagenesis. Glu97, present in loop D, is conserved in both 5-HT3R subunits A and B but neither in the 5-HT3R subunit C nor in nAChR subunits. Glu224 and Glu235, located in loop C, are present in all 5-HT3R subunits A but absent in the B and C subunits. An acidic residue at a position corresponding to Glu235 is conserved in all nAChR subunits. Amino acid residues in both loops have been shown to influence ligand binding (21Spier A.D. Lummis S.C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5620-5625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Here, wild type (WT) and mutant 5-HT3R proteins were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells and were characterized functionally by whole cell patch clamp and radioligand binding experiments; the presence of receptor proteins in the plasma membrane was investigated by immunocytochemistry and receptor binding of the GR-flu. The question whether the Glu residues investigated here create the local acidic environment sensed by receptor-bound GR-flu was studied by fluorescence spectroscopy. A structural model of the N-terminal domain of 5-HT3R based on the structure of AChBP was conceived in order to interpret our results. We present experimental evidence that, in contrast to Glu97, Glu224 and Glu235 are deeply involved in ligand binding of the 5-HT3R, because a decrease in both ligand affinity and efficacy of 1–3 orders of magnitude was observed when these residues were mutated. Moreover, for the first time, direct biophysical measurements are presented, restricting the location of Glu235 within 1 nm of the ligand-binding site of the 5-HT3R. The structural model corroborated these results. The radioligands 3-(5-methyl-1H-imidazol-4-yl)-1-(1-[3H]methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-propanone ([3H]GR65630; 61 Ci/mmol) and m-chlorophenyl-biguanidine ([3H]mCPBG; 20 Ci/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Granisetron and the fluorescent antagonist GR-flu were obtained from Glaxo Institute of Molecular Biology (Geneva, Switzerland). The agonists mCPBG and 5-HT were obtained from Tocris Cookson (Langford, UK) and Sigma. Monododecyl nonaethylene-glycol (C12E9) was from Anatrace (Maumee, OH). All other products used were of the highest quality available and purchased from regular sources. Site-directed Mutagenesis of 5-HT3R cDNA—Full-length cDNA encoding the short splicing variant of the murine 5-HT3R subunit (1Werner P. Kawashima E. Reid J. Hussy N. Lundstrom K. Buell G. Humbert Y.

Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange™ kit (Stratagene). Glutamates 97, 224, and 235 were mutated to glutamine and aspartate using mutagenic oligonucleotides that introduced as well a silent mutation to create a new restriction site to facilitate mutant screening (Table I of Supplementary Material). Mutations were confirmed by restriction pattern analysis and verified through sequence analysis.Table IAffinities of 5-HT, granisetron, GR65630, and mCPBG to wild-type and mutant 5-HT3R proteins measured by whole cell patch clamp, radioligand binding, and fluorescence microscopyElectrophysiology: 5-HT-induced currentsRadioligand binding5-HT3R protein[3H]mCPBG[3H]GR65630EC50Granisetron inhibition IC50KdGranisetron inhibition KiKdGranisetron inhibition KimCPBG inhibition KiμMnMnMnMWT2.1 ± 0.60.14 ± 0.112.7 ± 1.92.0 ± 0.61.4 ± 0.31.4 ± 0.411 ± 4E97Q2.0 ± 1.40.19 ± 0.129 ± 12aSignificantly different from WT (p ≤ 0.05).4.3 ± 2.12.3 ± 0.80.8 ± 0.3aSignificantly different from WT (p ≤ 0.05).5.3 ± 1.8aSignificantly different from WT (p ≤ 0.05).E97D2.1 ± 0.90.25 ± 0.112.8 ± 3.51.4 ± 0.43.5 ± 0.3aSignificantly different from WT (p ≤ 0.05).1.8 ± 0.412 ± 2E224Q7.5 ± 3.3aSignificantly different from WT (p ≤ 0.05).0.47 ± 0.313.0 ± 4.52.4 ± 0.44.5 ± 0.7aSignificantly different from WT (p ≤ 0.05).6 ± 2aSignificantly different from WT (p ≤ 0.05).9 ± 4E224D21 ± 5aSignificantly different from WT (p ≤ 0.05).1.2 ± 0.4aSignificantly different from WT (p ≤ 0.05).37 ± 5aSignificantly different from WT (p ≤ 0.05).7.0 ± 1.5aSignificantly different from WT (p ≤ 0.05).12 ± 3aSignificantly different from WT (p ≤ 0.05).11 ± 4aSignificantly different from WT (p ≤ 0.05).41 ± 11aSignificantly different from WT (p ≤ 0.05).E235Q44 ± 12aSignificantly different from WT (p ≤ 0.05).22 ± 5aSignificantly different from WT (p ≤ 0.05).>60aSignificantly different from WT (p ≤ 0.05).>22aSignificantly different from WT (p ≤ 0.05).>20aSignificantly different from WT (p ≤ 0.05).12 ± 5aSignificantly different from WT (p ≤ 0.05).150 ± 20aSignificantly different from WT (p ≤ 0.05).E235D>2·104NRbNR, not relevant.NBcNB, no specific binding could be detected.NRNBNRNRa Significantly different from WT (p ≤ 0.05).b NR, not relevant.c NB, no specific binding could be detected. Open table in a new tab Transient Transfection of HEK293 Cells—Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293 cells) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2.2% fetal calf serum in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Adherently growing cells were subcultivated once or twice a week at ratios between 1:10 and 1:100. To investigate the function of mutant receptors in cells by electrophysiology, immunolocalization, or binding the fluorescent ligand GR-flu, HEK293 cells (60–80% confluent), growing in either six-well plates or 35-mm cell culture dishes, were transfected using Effectene™ lipofection according to the protocol of the manufacturer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with 0.2 or 1.0 μg of plasmids containing the coding region of WT or the mutant 5-HT3R. After 4 h, the transfection solution was replaced by fresh medium. Experiments were performed 24–55 h after transfection. To investigate mutant receptors in either cell membranes or solubilized in detergent micelles (radioligand or GR-flu binding), HEK293 cells were seeded (1 × 105 cells/ml) into 150-cm2 flasks. 16–20 h after splitting, cells were transfected with calcium phosphate-precipitated DNA as described (22Pick H. Preuss A.K. Mayer M. Wohland T. Hovius R. Vogel H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For each transfection, 75 μg of WT or mutant 5-HT3R cDNAs diluted in 1.5 ml of CaCl2 (250 mm) was added to an equal volume of 140 mm NaCl, 1.4 mm Na2HPO4, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.05, at 23 °C. After a 1-min incubation at room temperature, the transfection solution was added to the cell culture medium. After a 4-h incubation at 37 °C, the transfection solution was replaced by fresh medium. 48 h after transfection, the cells were washed twice with PBS, detached from the surface by “hitting the flasks,” and harvested by centrifugation (3200 × g, 5 min). Electrophysiology—HEK293 cells were transiently transfected as described above but cotransfecting 0.2 μg of DNA of cytosolic green fluorescent protein (Clontech) to identify cells expressing the 5-HT3R. Standard patch clamp measurements were done in whole cell configuration employing an EPC-9 patch clamp amplifier (HEKA Elektronik Dr. Schulze GmbH, Lambrecht, Germany). For data acquisition and storage, the software PULSE 8.3 (HEKA) was used. Heat-polished borosilicate glass pipettes (resistances of 2–5 megaohms) were filled with 140 mm CsCl, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, whereas the external buffer solution was 147 mm NaCl, 12 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2,1mm MgCl2, both adjusted to pH 7.3 with NaOH. The ground electrode was connected to the bath via a 1 m KCl agar bridge. Ligands dissolved in the external buffer solution were applied with a RSC-200 perfusion system (Bio-Logic, Claix, France). During patch clamp experiments, the cells were continuously perfused. All experiments were performed at room temperature, and the membrane potential was kept at –60 mV. Recorded inward currents are displayed downward. At least six patches of each mutant protein from at least two different transfections were examined. The Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm of Igor Pro (Wavemetrics Inc., Lake Oswego, OR) was used to evaluate the data by fitting to the equations, I=Imax/{1+(EC50/[5−HT])n}(Eq. 1) and I=I0/{1+(IC50/[antagonist])−n}(Eq. 2) where I represents the peak current at a particular ligand concentration, Imax is the maximal peak current achievable, I0 is the peak current in absence of any antagonist, EC50 and IC50 are the half-maximal effective and inhibitory concentrations, respectively, and n is the Hill coefficient. For antagonist-agonist competition experiments, cells were perfused with granisetron-containing solutions for at least 2 min before adding 5-HT at a concentration inducing 90% of Imax of the respective mutant in the absence of granisetron. Binding Assay Using Radioligands—The affinity of 5-HT3R mutant proteins for radioligands and the total amount of ligand-binding sites were determined as described (23Hovius R. Tairi A.P. Blasey H. Bernard A. Lundstrom K. Vogel H. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 824-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) with the modification that samples containing ∼0.2 pmol of 5-HT3R were incubated for 60 min at room temperature in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with increasing concentrations of [3H]GR65630 (up to 20 nm) or [3H]mCPBG (up to 120 nm) in a final volume of 0.2 ml. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm quipazine (pK = 9.0 ± 0.3 (9Tairi A.P. Hovius R. Pick H. Blasey H. Bernard A. Surprenant A. Lundstrom K. Vogel H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15850-15864Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar)). All experiments were performed in triplicate. The affinity of the receptor for granisetron was determined by competition binding assays. Samples comprised ∼0.8 nm [3H]GR65630 or 20 nm [3H]mCPBG in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 5-HT3R-containing membranes to produce 100–2000 cpm of specifically bound radioactive ligand; they were incubated at increasing concentrations of the competitor in a final volume of 0.2 ml for 60 min at room temperature. The dissociation constant Kd of the radioligand, the total concentration of 5-HT3R (expressed as concentration of binding sites), and Hill coefficients (n) were evaluated by fitting experimental data as follows. [L]bound=[5−HT3R]total/{1+(Kd/[L]free)n} (Eq. 3) Binding inhibition curves were fitted to the following equation. [[B]=[Bo]/{1+(IC50/[competitor])−n} (Eq. 4) [B] and [Bo] are the concentrations of bound radioligand in the presence and absence of unlabeled competitor, respectively, and IC50 is the concentration of competing ligand that displaced 50% of the specifically bound radioligand. The dissociation constant of inhibition Ki of competitors was estimated from the Cheng-Prusoff equation (23Hovius R. Tairi A.P. Blasey H. Bernard A. Lundstrom K. Vogel H. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 824-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), Ki=IC50/{1+([L]/Kd)} (Eq. 5) where [L] and Kd are the concentration and dissociation constant of radioligand, respectively. Binding of GR-flu to Living Cells—HEK293 cells grown on glass coverslips in six-well plates were transfected as described above. 40 h after transfection, the coverslips were transferred into a sample holder and covered with 400 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. Then, during image recording using an LSM 510 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with appropriate excitation and emission filters for fluorescein and using identical settings for all samples when not stated otherwise, GR-flu was added to reach either 1.5 or 15 nm final concentration. Nonspecific binding of GR-flu to cells, measured in the presence of 1 μm quipazine, was negligible. Binding of GR-flu to Detergent-solubilized 5-HT3R—HEK293 cells harvested from one T150 flask were resuspended in 1 ml of 10 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, pelleted by centrifugation (10 min at 3200 × g at 4 °C), resuspended in 1 ml of total volume of the same buffer, and finally homogenized for 10 s with an Ultra-Turrax T25 (IKA, Staufen, Germany). Membranes obtained by this procedure were pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 3200 × g and 4 °C and resuspended in 1 ml of 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm C12E9, pH 7.4, and homogenized for 10 s with an Ultra-Turrax T25. Nonsolubilized matter was removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 50,000 × g and 4 °C. Detergent-solubilized receptor was incubated for 30 min in a solution containing 1 nm GR-flu, 10 mm HEPES, and 1 mm C12E9, pH 7.4, in the dark at room temperature. Total fluorescence intensity and fluorescence anisotropy were measured using an Analyst multiwell fluorescence reader (Molecular Devices, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Fluorescence signals were corrected for background fluorescence and nonspecific binding of GR-flu in the presence of 1 μm quipazine. Localization of 5-HT3Rs in Cells by Immunofluorescence—Microscopy glass cover slides with attached cells transiently expressing either WT or mutant 5-HT3Rs were washed three times with PBS and incubated in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for fixation of cells. To immunolabel the N-terminal extracellular domain, pAb120 antiserum, containing antibodies directed against the first 13 residues of the mature 5-HT3R (24Spier A.D. Wotherspoon G. Nayak S.V. Nichols R.A. Priestley J.V. Lummis S.C.R. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 67: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), was used at 1:1000 dilution in Tris-buffered saline. Intracellular receptor expression was determined by incubating cells in the presence of 0.3% Triton X-100 for membrane permeabilization. Primary antibodies were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (Vector, Burlingame, CA) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled avidin D (Vector) were used to detect bound antibodies following the manufacturer's instructions. Coverslides were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector); cells labeled with fluorescent antibodies were observed using an LSM 510 confocal microscope. Structural Model of Extracellular N-terminal Domain of 5-HT3R— The N-terminal domain of the murine 5-HT3R (SwissProt entry P23979, residues 14–217 of the mature protein; i.e. until 6 residues before the start of the first transmembrane domain) was aligned to the sequence of the AChBP (residues 1–198 of the recently solved crystal structure (Protein Data Bank entry 1I9B.pdb). Optimal alignment resulted in three gaps of 2, 1, and 3 residues, respectively, between residues Asp63-Gln64, Ala135-Thr136, and Asp153-Pro154 in the sequence of the AChBP. The alignment was submitted to SWISS-MODEL for the generation of a homology model of the N-terminal domain of the 5-HT3R based on the template of the structure of AChBP using Swiss-PbdViewer 3.7 as interface (25Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9586) Google Scholar). The structural model thus obtained was inspected using either Swiss-PbdViewer or Rasmol version 2.7. Electrophysiology—The functional properties of WT and mutant receptor proteins were investigated by whole cell patch clamp measurements. Typical electrical responses upon application of 5-HT with peak currents around 1–4 nA at saturating 5-HT concentrations (Fig. 2) indicated that WT and mutant receptor proteins were functionally expressed at similar levels. As an exception, in the case of E235D only small currents were observed at millimolar concentrations of 5-HT. From dose-response curves (Fig. 3), the EC50 (Table I) and the Hill coefficient n for 5-HT were evaluated. Whereas both mutant proteins of Glu97 showed no difference compared with WT, the EC50 values for E224Q, E224D, and E235Q were increased by a factor of 4, 10, and 20, respectively. In the case of E235D, no EC50 could be determined, since only small currents of some 100 pA could be recorded repetitively at 20 mm 5-HT, close to the solubility limit. Neither with 5-HT nor with the agonist mCPBG, which has a higher affinity to the WT receptor than 5-HT, could saturating ligand binding conditions be reached. Control experiments verified that nontransfected HEK293 cells did not respond electrically upon application of 5-HT or mCPBG concentrations up to 20 mm. This suggests that the EC50 of E235D is shifted more than 1000-fold to higher concentrations. The Hill coefficient n was similar for all mutant (except E235D) and WT receptors and ranged from 1.5 to 1.9. In contrast, the kinetics of channel activation and desensitization of E235Q were considerably slower than for Glu97 and WT (Fig. 2).Fig. 3Dose-response curves of 5-HT3R WT (×) and receptor mutant proteins E97Q (•), E97D (○), E224Q (▪), E224D (□), and E235Q (▴) upon application of 5-HT. Small currents for E235D (▵) measured at high 5-HT concentrations are also indicated. Currents were measured at a holding potential of –60 mV in whole cell configuration, normalized to Imax of the respective cell, and fitted to the Hill equation. Note that the Hill coefficient stays constant (n = 1.5–1.9) for WT and mutant proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Antagonist-agonist competition experiments yielded similar results (Fig. 4 and Table I). After incubation for 2–5 min with increasing concentrations of the antagonist granisetron, the response to 5-HT was recorded. The 5-HT concentration applied evoked 90% of Imax of the respective mutant in absence of granisetron. For mutant proteins of Glu97, granisetron inhibited 5-HT-induced currents equally well as for the WT; for E224Q, E224D, and E235Q, the IC50 of granisetron was shifted to higher concentrations by a factor of 3, 9, and >100, respectively. The Hill coefficient varied between 1.0 and 1.6. For E235D, this experiment could not have been carried out in a comparable way, because no complete 5-HT dose-response curve and thus no relative value to Imax could be determined. Binding Experiments Using Radioactive Ligands—To investigate whether the effects due to the different mutations observed by electrophysiology are caused by changes in ligand affinity or channel gating, the ligand-binding properties of the WT and mutant 5-HT3R were investigated using the radiolabeled agonist mCPBG and antagonist GR65630. Both the dissociation constants Kd of the binding of these ligands to the receptor proteins and the inhibition of radioligand binding by granisetron or mCPBG were investigated. The results are summarized in Table I. The expression level of the different mutant protei"
https://openalex.org/W2019773014,"Immune evasion strategies often shape the immunogenicity of parasite components. We recently found that the N-terminal extension of the major subunit of Echinococcus granulosus antigen B (AgB), the causative agent of hydatid disease, concentrates the immunoreactive B cell epitopes of the native molecule. The nature of this immunodominance was analyzed using four monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) defining overlapping epitopes in this region of the AgB molecule. The minimal epitope requirements of these mAbs were determined using phage display peptide libraries. The consensus sequences isolated with the mAbs, and alanine replacement analysis with synthetic peptides mapped the relevant molecular contacts within a short stretch corresponding to residues 17–24 of the AgB major subunit. Substitution of two critical residues within this stretch produced a dramatic loss of antigenicity, as determined by using patient sera. The circular dichroism spectra of the antigen, together with the distribution of the contact residues, suggest that this region adopts an amphipathic α-helix structure that clusters the contact residues on its polar side. To provide further insight in the interpretation of the structure activity relationships for this immunoreactive region of E. granulosus AgB, we developed a model for the N-terminal extension of the AgB major subunit, which helps to rationalize our data.

Lorenzo C. Nieto A. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2000; 11: 3979-3983Crossref Google Scholar). This is a singular finding considering that, in general, synthetic peptides are poor mimics of the parent epitope and, accordingly, exhibit low diagnostic sensitivities. There are several reasons for this. First, the full group of contact atoms of a given antibody/antigen interface are seldom derived from a short linear stretch of the antigen (8Berzofsky J. Science. 1985; 229: 932-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar); second, the structural conformation of peptides is not restricted in solution, and there is therefore an unfavorable entropic component to the binding (9Janin J. Chothia C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16027-16030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a single peptide mimics a partial region of the parent protein and, consequently, only a fraction of the polyclonal antibody response against the native antigen can be detected. Considering these arguments, the observed elevated antigenicity of p176 can only be explained on the basis of structural elements that favor the mimicking and by the fact that the N-terminal extension of AgB8/1 constitutes a major immunodominant region of the AgB molecule in human infections with E. granulosus. The existence of this immunoreactive region in the AgB molecule may involve an evasion strategy to preserve the biological function of this parasite component, as it has been found for components of other parasites (10Cazzulo J.J. Frasch A. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3259-3264Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Herein we report the analysis of the antigenic determinants of this region of the AgB molecule by using four monoclonal antibodies, synthetic peptides, and phage display peptide libraries. We were able to map key molecular contacts within residues 17–24 of the AgB8/1 subunit, which are part of the major B-cell epitopes of the antigen. The information provided by the families of phage-borne peptides is in line with the modeling of the N-terminal extension of the AgB8/1. Antibodies—The monoclonal antibodies used in this study, mAbs EB7, AB10, EG9, and BG10, have been described before (2Gonzalez G. Nieto A. Fernandez C. Orn A. Wernstedt C. Hellman U. Parasite Immunol. 1996; 18: 587-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). All four mAbs react with the AgB8/1 subunit of AgB or the native antigen but not with the AgB8/2 subunit. The mAbs were separated from culture supernatants using Protein G-Sepharose and were affinity-purified on an AgB-Sepharose column. AgB and Peptides—AgB was purified to homogeneity from hydatid cyst fluid as described before (2Gonzalez G. Nieto A. Fernandez C. Orn A. Wernstedt C. Hellman U. Parasite Immunol. 1996; 18: 587-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Recombinant AgB8/1 was a kind gift from Dr. Arnaldo Zaha. The following AgB8/1-derived peptides were used in this study: p176, p65, and p13 corresponding to residues 1–38, 13–38, and 13–26 of AgB8/1, respectively. In addition, alanine replacement variants of these peptides were also synthesized to examine the individual contribution of selected residues. The peptides were synthesized, purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, and analyzed by mass spectrometry at the Molecular Biology Unit, University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne (UK). Phage Display Libraries—The phage display peptide libraries used in the initial panning experiments were a kind gift from Dr. William Dower and consisted of: (i) a constrained library (CX7–12C-pIII) constructed in the phagemid vector pAFF2 (11Martens C.L. Cwirla S.E. Lee R.Y. Whitehorn E. Chen E.Y. Bakker A. Martin E.L. Wagstrom C. Gopalan P. Smith C.W. Tate E. Koller K.J. Schatz P.J. Dower W.J. Barrett R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21129-21136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) expressing a random sequence of 7–12 amino acids flanked by two invariant cysteine residues at the N-terminal region of the coat protein pIII and (ii) a non-constrained library (X11-pVIII) constructed in the p8V2 vector (12Cwirla S.E. Dower W.J. Li M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 128: 131-141PubMed Google Scholar) expressing a linear random sequence of 11 residues fused to the N-terminal end of the coat protein pVIII. The mutational library was constructed in the pAFF2 vector as described previously (13Gallop M.A. Barrett R.W. Dower W.J. Fodor S.P. Gordon E.M. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 1233-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar), and the total number of independent transformants obtained was 2 × 108. Biopanning Experiment—For panning and ELISAs, the mAbs were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (20 μg/ml) and immobilized on microtiter plates (Maxisorb, NUNC, Denmark) (50 μl/well) overnight at 4 °C. The plates were then blocked with PBS, pH 7.2/1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at room temperature and washed twice with PBS/0.05% Tween 20 (PBS/T). Phage libraries were screened as described (14Cwirla S.E. Peters E.A. Barrett R.W. Dower W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6378-6382Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). Briefly, a phage number equal to 100–1000 library equivalents was diluted in 600 μl of PBS/T, 1%BSA and dispensed into six antibody-coated wells for the first round of panning. The total number of phage added to wells in further rounds of panning was 1010 transducing units. The phages were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by extensive washing with PBS, and acid elution. The phage eluate was titrated and amplified in Escherichia coli ARI 292 (Affymax Research Institute). Phage ELISA—After three or four rounds of enrichment, individual phage clones were isolated and amplified, and their specificity assayed in an ELISA format (15Barrett R.W. Cwirla S.E. Ackerman M.S. Olson A.M. Peters E.A. Dower W.J. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 204: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) in wells coated with the mAb of interest, BSA or an non-related mouse IgG1 mAb. Briefly, phage (109 infectious particles) in 100 μl of PBS/1%BSA, or 100 μl of 1 μm AgB PBS/1%BSA were added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After extensive washing, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-M13 phage antibody (Amersham Biosciences) was added and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing, peroxidase activity was determined using H2O2/tetramethylbenzidine, measuring absorbance at 405 nm. DNA from immunopositive clones, which were negative in wells containing AgB, was prepared and sequenced as described (11Martens C.L. Cwirla S.E. Lee R.Y. Whitehorn E. Chen E.Y. Bakker A. Martin E.L. Wagstrom C. Gopalan P. Smith C.W. Tate E. Koller K.J. Schatz P.J. Dower W.J. Barrett R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21129-21136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Competition Binding Assay—Biotinylated AgB8/1 was used as a tracer to measure the median inhibitory concentration (IC50) of peptides binding to the mAbs adsorbed on ELISA plates. Peptides were diluted in Me2SO to prepare stock solutions at 2 mm. Serial dilution of the peptides in PBS/1%BSA were added to mAb (50 ng)-coated microtiter wells containing a fix amount of biotinylated AgB8/1 and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The final concentration of Me2SO was adjusted to 5% in all wells, which had previously been shown to have no influence in the mAb recognition. After washing, the amount of bound AgB8/1 was measured by the addition of a streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm AgB. Standard curves were obtained by plotting absorbance against the logarithm of inhibitor concentration, which were fitted to a four-parameter logistic equation. Circular Dichroism Spectra—Native AgB CD spectra were collected using an AVIV 202 CD spectrometer (Aviv Instruments). The sample was diluted 40× with Milli-Q water to a final concentration ∼0.1 mg/ml and centrifuged at 3000 rpm (r = 7 cm). An aliquot (100 μl) was suctioned from the middle section of the vial after centrifugation and loaded in a methanol-cleaned and air-dried cuvette (Uvonic ZC20). Data were collected in the region 180–260 nm (Wavelength Step, 1.00 nm; averaging time, 1.000 s; settling time, 0.330 s; multi-scan wait, 20.00 s). A 20-way average is presented in the figure. Modeling of the AgB8/1 Subunit N-terminal Extension—The simulations were carried out using X-plor version 3.451 (16Brünger A. X-PLOR Version 3.1 Manual. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar) using the CHARMm param19x set, including all atoms. A slow temperature ramp, from T = 150 K to T = 400 K (1 ns) and a very large cooling trajectory (10 ns, Tfinal = 300 K) was used to ensure that the model was properly relaxed. The model was subsequently minimized. All calculations were done using the Berendsen thermostat with FBETA = 10. An independent model for the peptide and the mimotopes was built using a technique called Feedback Restrained Molecular Dynamics (17Cachau R.E. Villar H.O. Advances in Computational Biology. 2. JAI, London1996: 66-119Google Scholar). No significant differences are observed between the two peptide models. The detailed analysis of the Feedback Restrained Molecular Dynamics models is presented elsewhere. 2R. E. Cachau, G. González-Sapienza, S. K. Burt, and O. N. Ventura, submitted for publication. Identification of the mAb Contact Residues with Phage Display Libraries—Using mAbs immobilized on ELISA plates, two phage display peptide libraries were screened for peptides that bind to the antibodies: a library with a variable number of random amino acids (ranging from 7 to 12) flanked by two cysteine residues and a random 11-mer linear library. After three rounds of affinity selection, clones that bound specifically to the selector antibody, but not to negative control wells (BSA or a non-related mAb), were selected by phage ELISA. The specificity of the selected clones was confirmed by studying the inhibitory effect of varying concentrations of AgB on their binding (not shown). Table I shows the deduced peptide sequences of 17 clones isolated with mAbs AB10 and EG9 from the CX7–12C-pIII library. Many of the clones selected with mAb AB10 were also selected with the mAb EG9. Moreover, all of these 17 clones were positive in phage ELISA with both mAbs (not shown). All isolated sequences contained the motif KY followed by a positively charged amino acid after the second or third residue. The stretch KYFFER found in the N-terminal extension of AgB8/1 subunit is a likely match for this motif (Fig. 1).Table ImAb AB10 and EG9 binding peptides isolated from the CX7-12C-pIII librarymAb AB10mAb EG9CEKYIMRTGDEIYC (3)CEKYIMRTGDEIYCCKYYGRTEGTNYNC (2)CKYYHRTEGTNYNCCGLMAKYLLERCCKYLHRFFDTSEECCLKYOAGKDVSFVC (2)CKYYTERIGVATFC (2)CLKYRSDKDVTWNCCLKYQAGKDVSFVCCLKYRSDKDVTWNCCLKYQAGKDVSLVCKYX2-3 (K/R) Open table in a new tab Twenty-four clones were selected with mAb BG10 from the CX7–12C-pIII library, which were grouped in two families (Table II). Family I was composed of 14 clones containing the KYX2–3(R/K) consensus, which was the same as that obtained with mAbs AB10 and EG9. In addition, the deduced sequences of three members of this family were identical to that of counterpart clones isolated with mAbs AB10 and EG9. However, a second family composed of 10 clones sharing the (R/S)XLH motif was also isolated with mAb BG10, indicating that this mAb defines a more complex epitope. To evaluate the relevance of these two families in the conformation of the binding epitope of mAb BG10, the X11-pVIII library was panned with mAb BG10. All eight selected clones encoded peptide sequences that contained the KY consensus.Table IImAb BG10 binding peptides isolated from random peptide librariesLibrary: CX7-12C-pIIILibrary: (X)11-pVIIIFamily IFamily IICKYALRQQLECCEAYWRPLHGHSC (2)KYLAKSLFEGQCKYSLRQGELCCDRTWRPLHRCGPVEKYCLRLLCDKYLLREGSEMRCCEYDHRPLHCGGLEKYCVERMCEKYIMRTGDEIYCCGDHQGRVLHCSSEMKYLIEIVCKYWDREFRGLHWCCEGHTGRVLHSFDCSPALKYLLMTFCKYAMRQLSDWCCQFYGWRVLHCFSAEGLLVKYCCKYYCRVEDTLHTCCSALHARLQLCSSFGTFLKYWTCVKYLVERDFFGRCCSALHARSGWCTPAQKYAEICCGSMAKYVMERCCSSLHSRMGDCCYKYASEKNLGFGCCLKYQAGKDVSFVC (2)CEKYTNEVEPLFRCCAKYRETMDDNYKCKY (X)2-3 (K/R)(R/S) XLH Open table in a new tab Selection of the CX7–12C-pIII library with mAb EB7 yielded a different picture (Table III). Twenty-one clones were selected, with the consensus sequence EXXPXRY. To further define the role of the different consensus residues and the relevance of the disulfide bridge, we built a mutagenesis library with the structure: (C/S)xxexxxxry(C/S). Where C/S stands for equal probability of finding Cys or Ser in that position. Amino acids shown in lowercase letters indicate a 50% probability of finding that residue in that position, whereas it is randomly occupied in the remaining 50%. Finally, x indicates a fully random position. All twenty-two binding peptides isolated from this mutagenesis library were flanked by Cys residues and had the expected amino acids in the biased positions (except for the final Tyr in two of the clones) (Table III). Markedly, all clones had Pro in position seven, which had not been biased in the library. In addition, there was a noticeable tendency for Gly at position five, a bulky aromatic residue (Tyr or Trp) at position six and Glu at position eight, corresponding to the EG(Y/W)PERY motif, where boldface letters indicate highly conserved residues. The presumed alignment of this sequence with AgB8/1 is shown in Fig. 1.Table IIImAb EB7 binding peptides isolated from the C(X)7-12C-pIII library (first column) and the mutagenesis library (second column)Library: C(X)7-12C-pIIILibrary: CxxexxxxryC-pIIICMVENYPERYC (5)CAREGYPARYC (6)CSQEGWPERYC (4)CMVENYPERYC (4)CSWEGWPERYCCRLEGWPERYCCSVEGYPARYC (3)CAREGWPERYCCSVEGYPARYC (2)CFMENHPERYCCAREGWPARYC (2)CEIEGCPERYC (2)CAAEGYPVRYCCEIEGWPERYCCMVEKNPVWYCCDQEGWPERYCCAYEERPIWYCCQLEGWPPRYCCYWERNGVVIQCCAREGFPPRYCCAREGYPPRHCCAMEGWPERFCCEIEGWPERFC- EXXPXRY -- EG (Y/W) PERY - Open table in a new tab Delimiting the Role of Critical Residues with Synthetic Peptides—To delimit the location of the epitopes defined by our mAbs we first used two synthetic peptides (p176 and p65) derived from the N-terminal region of the AgB8/1 subunit, which have been described as diagnostic reagents for hydatid disease. The relative affinity of the mAbs against peptides p176 and p65 was ranked by determining their IC50 in plates coated with the mAbs where the peptides competed for binding sites with the biotinylated AgB8/1 subunit (Table IV).Table IVValues of IC50 (m) for peptides p65 and p176 and native AgB determined by ELISA on microtiter plates coated with the mAbs and using biotinylated AgB8/1 subunit as reporterAntigenmAb AB10mAb EG9mAb BG10mAb EB7P658.8 × 10-79.2 × 10-78.3 × 10-62.3 × 10-7P1761.2 × 10-71.4 × 10-72.6 × 10-69.1 × 10-8AgB7.7 × 10-106.0 × 10-103.2 × 10-104.2 × 10-10 Open table in a new tab All mAbs reacted with native AgB in the subnanomolar range and with the peptides in the sub- to micromolar range. Because native AgB has several copies of the AgB8/1 subunit, the loss of the antibody bivalent binding explains the weaker interaction observed with the peptides. The reactivity with p176 and p65 narrowed down the location of the four mAb epitopes to residues 13–38 of AgB8/1 and is in agreement with the postulated alignment of the consensus sequences shown in Fig. 1. The stretch EVKYFFER, corresponding to residues 17–24, appeared to concentrate the relevant contact residues of the epitopes defined by the four mAbs (shown here in boldface). To confirm this assumption, we synthesized p13 (KMFGEVKYFFERDP), a truncated form of peptide p65, and systematically replaced the conserved positions with alanine to determine the effect on binding (Table V). Alanine substitutions were chosen to minimize unfavorable steric contacts and to avoid imposing new charge interactions or hydrogen bonds from the substituted side chains. In general, the mAbs bound to the truncated form of p65 with lower affinity, showing the relevance of the additional residues of p65 in the stabilization of the peptide structure that reproduces the antigenic determinants of AgB. The binding of the mAbs was highly sensitive to alanine replacement of the consensus residues. In that regard, mAbs AB10, EG9, and BG10, which produced the consensus sequence KYXXXR, were inactive when assayed with peptides p13–7, p13– 8, and p13–12, corresponding to substitutions of these residues in the stretch EVKYFFER. On the other hand, they still showed significant residual binding to peptide p13–5, which has the non-essential Glu residue at position 5 of p13 substituted by Ala. In the case of mAb EB7, it reacted with p13–7, which has a substitution of the Lys residue, that is absent in the consensus residues isolated with this mAb, but not with p13–5, p13– 8, or p13–12, where critical amino acid were substituted. Due to its scant solubility, no information was obtained about inhibition with p13–11.Table VAlanine replacement analysisPeptideSequenceAB10EG9BG10EB7p13KMFGEVKYFFERDP8.810145.5p13-5KMFGAVKYFFERDP101633>500p13-7KMFGEVAYFFERDP>500>500>50035p13-8KMFGEVKAFFERDP>500>500>500>500p13-11KMFGEVKYFFARDP>50aSolubility limit>50aSolubility limit>50aSolubility limit>50aSolubility limitp13-12KMFGEVKYFFEADP>500>500>500>500a Solubility limit Open table in a new tab A variant of p65 (p65-er) was also synthesized to assess the contribution of the EVKYFFER stretch in the polyclonal response against AgB. For this, the initial Glu and last Arg residues of this stretch (fifth and twelfth residues of p65) were replaced by Ala. In agreement with the previous alanine replacement experiments, the reactivity of mAbs AB10 and EB7 (as well as that of mAbs EG9 and BG10, not shown) was impaired by the modifications introduced in p65-er (Fig. 2a). The loss of p65 antigenicity by substitution of these two residues was also evident when the immunoreactivity of p65-er was examined using fifteen serum samples from patients with surgically confirmed hydatid disease and 10 serum samples from healthy donors (Fig. 2). The single modification of two residues in p65 affected the overall antibody response to the peptide, showing that the antigenic determinants built by the stretch EVKYFFER are major B cell epitopes in the polyclonal response to AgB in human infections with E. granulosus. Secondary Structure Analysis—The region of the AgB8/1 subunit that contains the EVKYFFER stretch is strongly predicted to have an α-helix secondary structure (18Rost R. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2656) Google Scholar). This is in consistent with the data of the native AgB CD spectrum (Fig. 3), which suggest that over 65% of the secondary structure of the AgB molecule corresponds to an α-helix organization (see Supplementary Material for a detailed analysis). Interestingly, such a structure would bring together, on the polar side of an amphipathic helix, the contact residues found in the consensus sequence isolated with the mAbs, which would thus be exposed to the solvent in the native AgB molecule (see Fig. 3, inset). Three-dimensional Model of the N-terminal Extension of the AgB8/1 Subunit—The CD spectra of native AgB and the two-dimensional prediction of the region corresponding to residues 1–38 of the AgB8/1 subunit (which we will call the p38 peptide), indicate that this region is predominantly α-helical with a short coil region determined by the Pro-X-Gly pair (DPLG region, Wisconsin Package Version 10.3, Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA). The structure of this peptide was thus initially modeled as an α-helix. The model was then relaxed using molecular dynamics simulations (see “Materials and Methods”). The structure of the final model is shown in Fig. 4. According to the model, the disposition of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues segregated in regions disposed in opposite faces of an elongated α-helix above and below the region where the immunogenic residues are found (Fig. 4). This disposition is the result of Pro26 disrupting the progression of the α-helical structure and the ability of Lys18 to directly interact with the backbone carbonyl of Gly16. This interaction is disrupted in some model simulations, including discrete water molecules (not shown). The most important modification of the model resulting from the inclusion of explicit solvent in the simulation is the relative higher flexibility of the region involving Pro26, Leu27, and Gly28. The lack of information regarding the folding of AgB8/1 subunit hinders our ability to uniquely identify the conformation of this region. The large flexibility of the region around Pro26 and the disposition of the hydrophobic residues are suggestive of a folded conformation similar to that first observed in staphylococcal Protein A, where an α-helix is bent over itself resulting in two α-helical segments anti-aligned (19Starovasnik M.A. Skelton N.J. Oconnell M.P. Kelley R.F. Reilly D. Fairbrother W.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15558-15569Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, we explored ways to fold p38 that cluster the hydrophobic regions following this pattern. We did this by resorting to the intercalation rules frequently used for the interpretation of the disposition of side-chains in coil-coiled structures and by subjecting the putative models to simulated annealing, solvating the model with 2200 water molecules (20Lazaridis T. Karplus M. J. Chem. Phys. 1996; 105: 4294-4316Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The lowest energy structure obtained, where the geometry of the immunogenic region has been preserved, is shown in Fig. 4. It must be noticed that this disposition of the p38 peptide makes the immunogenic region fully exposed by placing it at the elbow of the bent peptide model. It must also be noticed that the proper intercalation of the hydrophobic residues, now clustered at the core of the p38 model, almost entirely occluded and inaccessible to the solvent. Although the current knowledge on the biological role of AgB is limited, there is some evidence that strongly suggests that this is a crucial molecule for parasite survival. AgB is the major component of E. granulosus metacestode fluid and is highly abundant. In addition, the antigen is able to pass across the cyst wall and reach the host internal milieu. In evidence of the latter, patients affected by hydatid disease often elicit a strong antibody response against this antigen. The analysis of this response, using synthetic peptides and human sera, has revealed that the specificity of this antibody response is highly polarized to the N-terminal region of the AgB8/1 subunit (7González-Sapienza G. Lorenzo C. Nieto A. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2000; 11: 3979-3983Crossref Google Scholar, 21Leggatt G. McManus D. Parasite Immunol. 1994; 16: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In this work we utilized four previously characterized mAbs defining epitopes in this region of the AgB molecule as probes to analyze the nature of this immunogenicity. The mAbs were chosen on the basis of their capacity to inhibit the reactivity of human sera with native AgB (not shown). The alignment of the consensus sequences isolated with the four mAbs indicate that they define three overlapping antibody binding sites within a short region (EVKYFFER, residues 17– 24) of the N-terminal extension of the AgB8/1 subunit. One of these sites is defined by antibodies AB10 and EG9, which produced the KYX2–3(R/K) consensus sequence (putative contact residues in boldface). All phage clones isolated with AB10 cross-reacted with EG9 and vice versa; therefore, these two mAbs, which share the IgG1 isotype, are most likely derived from the same original B-cell clone and have identical antibody binding sites. The second site, defined by mAb BG10, is closely related to the former, but in addition to the KYX2–3(R/K) motif, this mAb also selected a phage family containing the (R/S)XLH consensus, which did not cross-react with mAbs AB10 or EG9. This indicates that the mAb BG10 binding site is more complex and may extend beyond the N-terminal region of the AgB8/1 subunit. In any case, the major contribution to the binding energy comes from the KY motif, as suggested by the fact that this motif was present in all clones isolated from the unconstrained X11-pVIII library, where, due to multivalent binding, selection is driven by avidity. The third antigenic site is delineated by mAb EB7 and was aligned to residues 17–24 of AgB/1. This antibody selected a strong consensus sequence that was further refined using a mutagenesis library. This fine-tuning demonstrated the relevance of the structural constraint imposed by the formation of the disulfide bond, and produced the EG(Y/W)PERY consensus (putative contact residues in boldface), which evidenced a preference for particular residues at positions other than those biased in the library. The deduction of the putative contact residues of mAb EB7 binding site was done on the basis that antibodies pick those amino acids out of the library with which they normally make molecular contacts, whereas other amino acids of the consensus sequence are necessary to build the scaffold that exposes the contact residues in the proper orientation (22Rodi D.J. Makowski L. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1999; 10: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). This seems to be the role of the consensus glycine and proline residues, whose effect on polypeptides is almost entirely steric, markedly so in the case of proline, that being a ring greatly limits the number of possible peptide conformations. The proposed alignment of the four mAbs consensus sequences with residues 17–24 of the AgB/1 subunit was confirmed, first by analysis of the reactivity of the mAbs using long peptides and then by the alanine replacement strategy with short peptides. This region of the AgB8/1 subunit not only demonstrably contained the binding sites of the four mAbs, but it also proved to be a major immunodominant region of the AgB molecule during the course of human infections, as evidenced by the significant drop in the diagnostic value of p65 when the flanking residues of the stretch EVKYFFER were replaced by Ala. To provide further insight in the interpretation of the structure-activity relationships for this immunoreactive region of E. granulosus AgB, we developed a model for this subunit. We restricted our analysis to the N-terminal half of AgB8/1 (residues 1–38), which, based on the outcome of two-dimensional predictive algorithms and the AgB CD spectra, was modeled as an α-helix by standard modeling techniques (Fig. 4). The model 1 is very much in line with the information obtained with the panning experiments and the alanine replacement analysis. According to our model, the main contact residues of the four mAbs form a contiguous surface, which is also in agreement with the observation that these mAbs compete to each other. The central Tyr20 residue is flanked by two salt bridges, Glu17/Lys19 and Glu23/Arg24; with the exception of the aromatic pairing of Tyr20 with Phe21 and the interaction of Glu17 with Lys13 forming a salt-bridge triad, all other main interactions occur within this region. Based, therefore, on the p38 model, this establishes a favorable situation to promote antibody recognition, because the weak bond reorganization that takes place at the antigen-antibody interface would not propagate to the rest of the AgB molecule thus producing a thermodynamically favored binding. In addition, the contiguous Pro-X-Gly motif suggests that the model may actually be bent in the folded conformation, which may add to our interpretation of the data by even further exposing the immunogenic residues at the elbow of the bent region (Fig. 4). In general, the immunoreactivity of a given protein is the result of intrinsic features of its structure as well as factors intrinsic to the host encountering the antigen (8Berzofsky J. Science. 1985; 229: 932-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). According to our model, residues 17–24 of AgB8/1 fulfill the basic structural requirements that may determine their antigenicity, however, the observed immunodominance of this region is surely a more complex phenomenon, which was shaped under the selective pressure imposed by the need to preserve the functionality of the AgB molecule against the host immune response (10Cazzulo J.J. Frasch A. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3259-3264Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, the information of the structural characteristics of the AgB immunodominant antigenic sites not only has potential value for further development of peptidomimetics for diagnosis but it also provides an interesting case of protein immunogenicity.

https://openalex.org/W2074898096,"Identification of the protein domains that are responsible for RNA recognition has lagged behind the characterization of protein-DNA interactions. However, it is now becoming clear that a range of structural motifs bind to RNA and their structures and molecular mechanisms of action are beginning to be elucidated. In this report, we have expressed and purified one of the two putative RNA-binding domains from ZNF265, a protein that has been shown to bind to the spliceosomal components U1-70K and U2AF35 and to direct alternative splicing. We show that this domain, which contains four highly conserved cysteine residues, forms a stable, monomeric structure upon the addition of 1 molar eq of Zn(II). Determination of the solution structure of this domain reveals a conformation comprising two stacked β-hairpins oriented at ∼80° to each other and sandwiching the zinc ion; the fold resembles the zinc ribbon class of zinc-binding domains, although with one less β-strand than most members of the class. Analysis of the structure reveals a striking resemblance to known RNA-binding motifs in terms of the distribution of key surface residues responsible for making RNA contacts, despite a complete lack of structural homology. Furthermore, we have used an RNA gel shift assay to demonstrate that a single crossed finger domain from ZNF265 is capable of binding to an RNA message. Taken together, these results define a new RNA-binding motif and should provide insight into the functions of the >100 uncharacterized proteins in the sequence data bases that contain this domain.

The zinc finger architecture has provided a diverse range of structures and functions (1Krishna S.S. Majumdar I. Grishin N.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 532-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar), including recognition of protein, DNA, and RNA targets. Whereas the structural basis for interactions between DNA and classical zinc fingers has been well characterized (2Foster M.P. Wuttke D.S. Radhakrishnan I. Case D.A. Gottesfeld J.M. Wright P.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 3Wuttke D.S. Foster M.P. Case D.A. Gottesfeld J.M. Wright P.E. J. Mol.

Biol. 2000; 301: 47-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), RNA-zinc finger interactions are less well understood, with only limited structural information on the conformation of RNA-binding domains available. Available structures have indicated that in many cases, RNA-binding domains are not completely folded in the absence of their target RNA sequence (5Draper D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Conformational changes have been observed to occur in both protein and the RNA target upon binding (5Draper D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 6Battiste J.L. Tan R. Frankel A.D. Williamson J.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2741-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 7Tan R. Frankel A.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14579-14585Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 8Chen L.

Science. 1995; 270: 1200-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), and even completely unstructured domains have been found to fold upon interacting with RNA (10Markus M.A. Hinck A.P. Huang S. Draper D.E. Torchia D.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It has therefore been suggested that rigid proteins may be unfavorable for RNA-binding and flexible structures may increase specificity (5Draper D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). In recent years, the functions of many RNA-binding proteins that regulate the process of RNA splicing have been delineated, enhancing our understanding of splice site recognition, spliceosomal coordination, and alternative splicing. Typically, the accessory proteins involved in splicing (SR proteins) contain an N-terminal RNA-binding domain and a C-terminal protein-binding or RS domain that is rich in Arg and Ser residues. The human SR protein, ZNF265 (or ZIS) (11Nakano M. Yoshiura K. Oikawa M. Miyoshi O. Yamada K. Kondo S. Miwa N. Soeda E. Jinno Y. Fujii T. Niikawa N. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 225: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), can bind to the splicing factors U1-70K and U2AF35 (components of the E-complex that forms early in the splicing process) and is able to stimulate alternative splicing (12Adams D.J. van der Weyden L. Mayeda A. Stamm S. Morris B.J. Rasko J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It has also been shown to immunoprecipitate with splicing factors in association with mRNA and to co-localize in the nucleus with components of the transcriptosome (12Adams D.J. van der Weyden L. Mayeda A. Stamm S. Morris B.J. Rasko J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), indicating that it plays a role in mRNA processing. ZNF265 is a multidomain protein, and is highly conserved in many organisms, including mouse (Zfp265) (13Adams D.J. van der Weyden L. Kovacic A. Lovicu F.J. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Ioannou P.A. Morris B.J. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 2000; 88: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), rat (Zfp265; formerly Zis) (14Karginova E.A. Pentz E.S. Kazakova I.G. Norwood V.F. Carey R.M. Gomez R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F731-F738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Xenopus (C4SR) (15Ladomery M. Marshall R. Arif L. Sommerville J. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 256: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Like other SR proteins, ZNF265 contains a C-terminal RS domain, as well as a nuclear localization sequence and a glutamic acidrich domain. However, in contrast to other SR proteins, the N terminus of ZNF265 does not contain any of the known RNA recognition motifs, but rather contains 8 Cys residues spaced appropriately to give rise to two putative zinc finger domains, each with a CX2/4CX10CX2C topology. Domains with homology to the putative zinc fingers of ZNF265 have been observed in a wide range of proteins, including ubiquitin ligases such as Mdm2 (16Momand J. Zambetti G.P. Olson D.C. George D. Levine A.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1237-1245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2792) Google Scholar, 17Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar) and RanBP2 (18Yokoyama N. Hayashi N. Seki T. Pante N. Ohba T. Nishii K. Kuma K. Hayashida T. Miyata T. Aebi U. Fukui M. Nishimoto T. Nature. 1995; 376: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 19Pichler A. Gast A. Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Melchior F. Cell. 2002; 108: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar), as well as RNA-binding proteins such as EWS (20May W.A. Gishizky M.L. Lessnick S.L. Lunsford L.B. Lewis B.C. Delattre O. Zucman J. Thomas G. Denny C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5752-5756Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). However, little structural information is available on any of these proteins. In addition, the putative zinc finger domains appear to be capable of carrying out different functions depending on context. In RanBP2, the eight tandem zinc finger domains are essential for exportin-1 binding (21Singh B.B. Patel H.H. Roepman R. Schick D. Ferreira P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37370-37378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), whereas the double zinc finger domain in C4SR, the Xenopus homolog of ZNF265, binds to RNA (15Ladomery M. Marshall R. Arif L. Sommerville J. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 256: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that the conserved Cys-containing motifs in ZNF265 are genuine zinc-binding domains and we have determined the solution conformation of the first zinc finger of ZNF265, using NMR methods. The structure appears to constitute a variant of the zinc ribbon class of zinc-binding domains (1Krishna S.S. Majumdar I. Grishin N.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 532-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). In addition, we demonstrate that the ZNF265 zinc finger domain can bind cyclin B1 mRNA, indicating that this fold has apparently been adapted for both RNA-binding and protein-binding. Such adaptability appears to be common among zinc-binding motifs. Sequence Analysis—All sequence analysis and alignments were performed using the software pileup and prettybox (Australian Genome Information Service). 1See www.angis.org.au. Expression and Purification—The first putative zinc finger region of ZNF265 is located at the N-terminal end of the protein. A construct encoding residues 1–40 of human ZNF265 (accession code NP_005446) was therefore cloned into the Escherichia coli expression vector pGEX 4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences), creating a C-terminal fusion with glutathione S-transferase (GST). 2The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathione S-transferase; REMSA, RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay; CF, crossed finger domain; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. Note that DNA sequencing revealed that all 10 isolated clones contained aspartic acid at position 32, rather than asparagine (the residue listed in the GenBank™ sequence). It is likely that the sequence variation indicates either a single nucleotide polymorphism or perhaps a sequencing error in the original paper (11Nakano M. Yoshiura K. Oikawa M. Miyoshi O. Yamada K. Kondo S. Miwa N. Soeda E. Jinno Y. Fujii T. Niikawa N. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 225: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar); only one cDNA was sequenced in this initial report. The fusion protein was expressed in the host strain DH5α grown in Luria-Bertani broth. Cells were grown at 37 °C, and expression of ZNF265-F1 was induced at an A600 nm of 0.6 by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.5 mm). After a further 3 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the cell pellet was stored at –80 °C prior to use. Cell pellets were resuspended in sonication buffer containing Tris (50 mm, pH 8), NaCl (50 mm), Triton X-100 (1%), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm), and β-mercaptoethanol (2 mm). Cells were lysed by sonication and centrifuged. The supernatant was loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose™ 4B (Amersham Biosciences) column pre-equilibrated in sonication buffer. The column was washed and the 45-residue ZNF265-F1 peptide (containing an additional Gly-Ser at the N terminus, arising from the thrombin recognition site and a Gly-Pro-Ile at the C terminus because of cloning via a pGEM™-T Easy intermediate) cleaved from the column with thrombin (5 units/1 ml of beads) at room temperature overnight. The eluted peptide was purified to homogeneity by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, and its identity confirmed using electrospray mass spectrometry (Mtheor = 4995.6 Da; Mobs = 4996.0 Da). Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed using a Beckman model XL-A analytical ultra-centrifuge equipped with an An-60 Ti rotor. ZNF265-F1 was prepared by dissolving lyophilized peptide in H2O containing 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine and 1.7 mm ZnSO4 and the pH was adjusted to 5.8 using 0.1 m NaOH. Protein concentrations were determined in the XL-A by reference to a blank containing this buffer alone. Data were collected in two-sector cells as absorbance (280 nm) versus radius scans (0.001 cm increments, 10 averages) at 36,000, 43,000, and 56,000 rpm. Scans were collected at 3-h intervals and compared to determine when the samples reached equilibrium. Analysis of the data was carried out using the NONLIN software (22Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar) and the best model and final parameters were determined by examination of the residuals derived from fits to several models. The partial specific volume of ZNF265-F1 (0.708 ml g–1) and the density of the buffer (0.999 g ml–1) were determined from the amino acid sequence (23Perkins S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar) using the program SEDNTERP (www.bbri.org/rasmb/rasmb.html) (24Hayes D.B. Laue T. Philo J. SEDNTERP: Interpretation of Sedimentation Data. Boston Biomedical Research Institute, Boston, MA1994Google Scholar). NMR Spectroscopy—ZNF265-F1 was prepared for NMR by dissolving ∼2.5 mg of peptide in H2O/D2O (95:5, 500 μl) containing tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (5 mm) and ZnSO4 (1.5 mm), giving a ∼1 mm sample. The sample was prepared at low pH to avoid protein aggregation, and the pH was then increased to 5.8 using 0.1 m NaOH. The sample was placed in a 5-mm outer diameter, susceptibility matched microcell (Shigemi). For experiments in D2O, the sample was lyphophilized and reconstituted in a microcell in 500 μl of 99.96% D2O. All NMR experiments used for determination of the structure of ZNF265-F1 were carried out at 298 K on a 600-MHz Bruker DRX600 spectrometer, equipped with a 5-mm triple resonance probe and three-axis pulsed field gradients. Water suppression was achieved using pulsed-field gradients and the WATERGATE sequence (25Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3527) Google Scholar). The following homonuclear two-dimensional spectra were recorded on the ZNF265-F1 sample: DQFCOSY (26Piantini U. Sorensen O.W. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 6800-6801Crossref Scopus (1887) Google Scholar), TOCSY (27Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar) (τm = 35 and 70 ms), and NOESY (28Kumar A. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 95: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2030) Google Scholar) (τm = 50 and 200 ms). Acquisition times were 33 and 131 ms for each of these experiments in t1 and t2, respectively. Spectra were processed using XWINNMR (Bruker) on a Silicon Graphics O2 work station. The 1H frequency scale of all spectra was directly referenced to sodium 3-trimethylsilyl propionate-2,2,3,3-d4 at 0.00 ppm. Two-dimensional NMR spectra were processed using Lorentz-Gauss window functions in the directly detected dimension and shifted square sine bell functions in the indirectly detected dimension. Polynomial baseline corrections were applied to the processed spectra in F2. Spectra were analyzed using the program XEASY (29Bartels C. Xia T.-H. Billeter P. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar). Structure Calculations—NOE-derived distance restraints were obtained from intensities of cross-peaks in the two-dimensional 1H NOESY spectra and calibrated using the CALIBA module of DYANA (30Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar). Dihedral angle restraints for ϕ angles were set to –60 ± 40o for 3JHNα < 6 Hz and –120 ± 40o for 3JHNα > 8 Hz, based on the use of the INFIT algorithm (31Szyperski T. Guntert P. Otting G. Wuthrich K. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 99: 552-560Google Scholar) that is part of the XEASY package. In addition, a restraint of –100 ± 80o for ϕ angles was applied for residues in which the intraresidue Hα-HN NOE was clearly weaker than the NOE between Hα and HN of the following residue (32Scanlon M.J. Naranjo D. Thomas L. Alewood P.F. Lewis R.J. Craik D.J. Structure. 1997; 5: 1585-1597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The β methylene protons of the two Pro residues were stereospecifically assigned from NOESY spectra on the basis that Hα is always closer to Hβ3 than Hβ2 (33Kline A.D. Braun W. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 675-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Both X-Pro bonds were identified as being in the trans-conformation on the basis of strong NOEs between the Hδ values of each Pro residue and the Hα protons of the preceding residues (34Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). No hydrogen bond restraints were used in the structure calculations. Initially, structure calculations were performed in DYANA using a distance geometry/simulated annealing protocol (30Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar) and additional NOEs were assigned iteratively based on earlier sets of structures. No assumption about zinc coordination was made at this stage and preliminary structures indicated the four cysteines (Cys15, Cys20, Cys31, and Cys34) were possible zinc ligands. To include additional distance and angle constraints that maintain the tetrahedral bonding geometry and appropriate bond lengths with the zinc atom (35Neuhaus D. Nakaseko Y. Schwabe J.W. Klug A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 637-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), as well as to incorporate ambiguous restraints, subsequent structural refinement was performed in CNS (36Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar) using the package ARIA1.2 (37Nilges M. Macias M.J. O'Donoghue S.I. Oschkinat H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 408-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 38Nilges M. Fold Des. 1997; 2: S53-S57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Manually assigned NOEs in combination with the remaining ambiguous NOEs were included in the ARIA structure calculations and the latter NOEs were iteratively assigned by the program. Briefly, eight cycles of 20 structures each and a last cycle of 500 structures were performed in the final refinement. Manually assigned NOEs were included in iteration zero as soft restraints. In each cycle the seven lowest energy structures from the previous iteration were used to extract additional NOE restraints with a tolerance of 0.02 ppm in the F1 dimension and 0.02 ppm in the F2 dimension. If a restraint was violated by more than a predefined target value in over 50% of the seven structures, it was discarded. The violation target value was progressively reduced from 1000 Å in iteration zero to 0.1 Å in iteration eight. Ambiguous distance restraints were treated as described (38Nilges M. Fold Des. 1997; 2: S53-S57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and the peak volume cut off was gradually reduced from 1.01 in the first iteration to 0.80 in the last. Dihedral angle restraints and stereospecific assignments as detailed above were also included in the calculations. The final assignments made by ARIA were checked and corrected manually where necessary. Overall, 4 (1.2%) non-sequential inter-residue NOEs for which no consistent assignment could be determined were excluded from the final calculations. Calculations were carried out in the simplified all-hydrogen PARALLHDG5.3 force field with non-bonded interactions modeled by PROLSQ force field (39Linge J.P. Nilges M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar); floating chirality assignment (40Folmer R.H. Hilbers C.W. Konings R.N. Nilges M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 9: 245-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) was used for all methylene and isopropyl groups for which no stereospecific assignment could be made. Finally, the 100 lowest energy structures were refined in a 9-Å shell of water molecules (41Jorgensen W.L. Chandrasekhar J. Madura J. Impey R. Klein M. J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79: 926-935Crossref Scopus (30173) Google Scholar). The 20 conformers with the lowest value of Etot were visualized and analyzed using the programs MOLMOL (42Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 (51–55): 29-32Crossref Scopus (6490) Google Scholar), PROCHECK (43Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4429) Google Scholar), and WhatIf (44Vriend G. Sander C. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 47-60Crossref Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The family of 20 low-energy structures (accession code 1N0Z) have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank. Chemical shift and restraint lists that were used in the structure calculations have been deposited in BioMagRes-Bank (accession code 5667). RNA Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (REMSA)—Expression plasmids harboring the full-length cyclin B1 cDNA were used to transcribe the cyclin RNA probe in vitro. Following linearization with BamHI, 1 μg of template was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in the presence of 50 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (DuPont), 10 μm UTP, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm GTP, 0.5 mm CTP, 20 units of RNase inhibitor (Promega), and 50 units of T7 RNA polymerase. RNA probes were purified on a 4% polyacrylamide-urea denaturing gel, eluted overnight at room temperature in a solution containing 500 mm NH4CH3COO and 1 mm EDTA, ethanol precipitated at –80 °C, and resuspended in water (100 cps/μl) as previously described (45Maurer F. Tierney M. Medcalf R.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1664-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For the binding assays, 0.1–5.0 μg of affinity purified GSTZNF265-F1 protein was preincubated with 150 μg of heparin (Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature in CEB buffer before addition of the RNA probe (200 cps). After 30 min incubation at room temperature, samples were subjected to RNase T1 digestion (1 μl; 2 units; Roche Applied Science) for 15 min at room temperature. Samples were then electrophoresed through a 4% native polyacrylamide gel and protein-RNA complexes were visualized by autoradiography. Homology of the Zinc Finger Domain of ZNF265—To investigate the conservation of the zinc finger domains of ZNF265, a Blast analysis was conducted using the amino acid sequence of the first zinc finger domain. Fig. 1 shows that in addition to being nearly identical to each other, both of the zinc fingers of human ZNF265 are completely conserved across a number of eukaryotic species, including rat and mouse ZFP265 and the RNA-binding protein C4SR from Xenopus laevis. Furthermore, these domains show homology to the zinc fingers found in Drosophila sol (46Delaney S.J. Hayward D.C. Barleben F. Fischbach K.F. Miklos G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7214-7218Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), as well as in RNA-binding proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana, suggesting ancient origins for this zinc finger motif, and therefore an important function(s). More than 100 proteins carry domains of this type, and these proteins exhibit a variety of domain structures and functions. Proteins may contain between one and eight copies of these domains, which may be arranged either in tandem clusters or spread throughout the protein. In some cases, no other recognizable sequence motifs have been identified. Despite this diversity, two functional themes are apparent. Several of the proteins (such as RanBP2) are involved in either ubiquitination or SUMOylation, whereas many others appear to be involved in RNA metabolism. Thus, in a number of cases, the putative zinc-binding motif is directly C-terminal to a known RNA recognition motif, such as an RRM domain (47Perez-Canadillas J.M. Varani G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and proteins such as ZNF265 contain other elements associated with splicing, such as RS domains (48Graveley B.R. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 765-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The Cysteine-rich Region of ZNF265 Forms a Monomeric Zinc-dependent Structure—Sequence analysis performed at the time of the initial discovery of rat ZFP265 (“Zis” (14Karginova E.A. Pentz E.S. Kazakova I.G. Norwood V.F. Carey R.M. Gomez R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F731-F738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) identified the putative zinc finger domains of this protein, although no experimental verification was made. We therefore subcloned DNA encoding the first such domain from ZNF265 (ZNF265-F1) into the pGEX-4T-3 vector. The protein was expressed as a GST fusion and purified using affinity chromatography and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Onedimensional 1H NMR spectra, recorded at pH 5.8 in both the absence and presence of 1 molar eq of Zn(II) (Fig. 2A), showed a substantial increase in chemical shift dispersion in the presence of Zn(II). This increase is consistent with the formation of persistent secondary structure and demonstrates that these domains are indeed genuine zinc finger domains. To determine the aggregation state of ZNF265-F1, we used sedimentation equilibrium methods (Fig. 2B). Data were recorded on two different loading concentrations at three speeds, and these data were well fitted by a model incorporating a single, ideal species with a molecular mass of 4.9 kDa (with 95% confidence intervals of 4.5 and 5.2 kDa; Mtheor = 5,061 Da). Thus ZNF265-F1 is monomeric in solution under these conditions. Determination of the Structure of ZNF265-F1—The high quality of the 1H NMR spectra of ZNF265-F1 in the presence of Zn(II) (Fig. 2A) allowed us to determine the three-dimensional solution structure of this domain. 1H resonance assignments were achieved by using standard two-dimensional homonuclear NMR experiments. Using DYANA (30Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar), NOEs were iteratively assigned and a preliminary was fold determined; no zinc ion was included, and the zinc coordination site was not restrained during these calculations. On the basis of these structures, it was clear that the four cysteine thiol groups (Cys15, Cys20, Cys31, and Cys34) comprised the zinc coordination sphere. Subsequent calculations, carried out using the ARIA protocol (37Nilges M. Macias M.J. O'Donoghue S.I. Oschkinat H. J. Mol.

The remaining ambiguous NOEs were introduced iteratively in ARIA in an automated manner. The final ensemble of the 20 lowest energy structures is based on a total of 709 unambiguous intra- and inter-residue distance restraints derived from two-dimensional NOESY spectra and 22 backbone dihedral restraints. The total number of experimental restraints was 731. Of these, 347 were meaningful inter-residues restraints, representing an average of 12.8 constraints per structured residue (i.e. residues 12–38). From the final ARIA calculations, the 20 lowest energy structures were chosen to represent the solution structure of ZNF265-F1 (Fig. 3A). The structures display good covalent geometry and good nonbonded contacts. Analysis of the structures with PROCHECK (43Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol.

https://openalex.org/W2048863214,"The naturally occurring mutations G51A and G51V in transmembrane helix I and G89D in the transmembrane helix II of rhodopsin are associated with the retinal degenerative disease autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. To probe the orientation and packing of helices I and II a number of replacements at positions 51 and 89 were prepared by using site-directed mutagenesis, and the corresponding proteins expressed in COS-1 cells were characterized. Mutations at position 51 (G51V and G51L) bound retinal like wild-type rhodopsin but had thermally destabilized structures in the dark, altered photobleaching behavior, destabilized metarhodopsin II active conformations, and were severely defective in signal transduction. The effects observed can be correlated with the size of the mutated side chains that would interfere with specific interhelical interaction with Val-300 in helix VII. Mutations at position 89 had sensitivity to charge, as in G89K and G89D mutants, which showed reduced transducin activation. G89K showed a second absorbing species in the UV region at 350 nm, suggesting a charge effect of the introduced lysine. Increased formation of non-active forms of rhodopsin, like metarhodopsin III, may have some influence in the molecular defect underlying retinitis pigmentosa in the mutants studied. At the structural level, the effect of the mutations analyzed can be rationalized assuming a very specific set of tertiary interactions in the interhelical packing of the transmembrane segments of rhodopsin.

Rhodopsin is the photoreceptor protein in rod cells of the vertebrate retina that serves as signal transducer from a photon of light to a neural response (1Hargrave P.A. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 3-9PubMed Google Scholar, 2Sakmar T.P. Menon S.T. Marin E.P. Awad E.S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 443-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 3Arshavsky V.Y.

Rhodopsin is an integral membrane protein that belongs to the large superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; Meta II, metarhodopsin II; Meta III; metarhodopsin III; DM, n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside; RP, retinitis pigmentosa; ADRP, autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa; Gt, transducin; WT, wild-type rhodopsin; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate.1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; Meta II, metarhodopsin II; Meta III; metarhodopsin III; DM, n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside; RP, retinitis pigmentosa; ADRP, autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa; Gt, transducin; WT, wild-type rhodopsin; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. characterized by a seven-transmembrane helical motif (5Bockaert J.

Because of the structural similarity among its members, rhodopsin has been used as a model for the GPCR superfamily. This visual receptor, however, has unique structural features, such as having its ligand (11-cis-retinal) covalently bound through a protonated Schiff base linkage to Lys-296 in the seventh helical segment of the protein. Retinal isomerization, upon light absorption, generates a signal in the helical cluster that is transmitted to the cytoplasmic domain where the interaction with the different proteins of the phototransduction cascade takes place. A recent landmark in rhodopsin studies has been the report of its crystal structure (8Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T.

Sci. 2001; 22: 587-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), the details of the conformational rearrangements after retinal photoisomerization are far from being completely understood. Recently, the presence of rhodopsin in native disk membranes organized as rows of dimers has been reported (14Fotiadis D. Liang Y. Filipek S. Saperstein D.A. Engel A. Palczewski K. Nature. 2003; 421: 127-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). This specific arrangement would be responsible for the high efficiency in light absorption by retinal photoreceptors. Dimerization is thought to be a universal phenomenon for modulation of receptor function in GPCR (15Gomes I. Jordan B.A. Gupta A. Rios C. Trapaidze N. Devi L.A. J. Mol. Med. 2001; 79: 226-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of inherited degenerative retinopathies genetically and clinically heterogeneous (16Berson E.L. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1993; 34: 1659-1676PubMed Google Scholar, 17Farrar G.J. Kenna P.F. Humphries P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 857-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In the past decade, more than 150 mutations have been discovered in the opsin gene associated with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (ADRP). These are mainly point mutations and a few deletions. Mutations associated with ADRP are found spread all over the opsin gene in the three domains of the receptor: intradiscal, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic. We started a detailed characterization of ADRP mutants in the transmembrane region of rhodopsin with a 2-fold interest, (i) elucidation of the molecular mechanism of the disease and (ii) structural and functional information, from the study of these mutations that might be relevant to other members of the GPCR superfamily. The recent crystal structure together with the available biochemical data on rhodopsin mutants has shed more light into the molecular mechanism of RP associated with rhodopsin mutations (18Garriga P. Manyosa J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 528: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 19Stojanovic A. Hwa J. Receptors Channels. 2002; 8: 3-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies show that conservative mutations in helix III at Leu-125 (site of the ADRP mutation L125R) led to misfolding, and it was proposed that the folding of the intradiscal and transmembrane domains are coupled (20Liu X. Garriga P. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4554-4559Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 21Garriga P. Liu X. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1997; 94: 10571-10576Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These studies were further extended to dissect the effect of mutations at Leu-125 in the folding and function of rhodopsin (23Andrés A. Kosoy A. Garriga P. Manyosa J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5696-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). G51V and G89D naturally occurring ADRP mutations were first reported in 1991 (24Dryja T.P. Hahn L.B. Cowley G.S. McGee T.L. Berson E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9370-9374Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 25Sung C.-H. Davenport C.M. Hennessey J.C. Maumenee I.H. Jacobson S.G. Heckenlively J.R.

Davenport C.M. Javcobson S.G. Hennessey J.C. Gonzalez-Fernandez F. Conway B.P. Keckenlively J. Palmer R. Maumenee I.H. Sieving P. Gouras P. Good W. Nathans J. Am. J. Hum.

Chem. 1993; 268: 26645-26649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and G89D (28Sung C.-H. Schneider B. Agawal N. Papermaster D.S. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8840-8844Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) mutants together with other ADRP mutations was carried out in 293S cell membranes. In another study these mutants were expressed in COS-1 cells and purified (29Kaushal S. Khorana H.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6121-6128Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Later, the mutants G51A, G51V, and G89D were studied in the context of the folding and packing of the transmembrane domain together with ADRP mutations in the other helices of rhodopsin (22Hwa J. Garriga P. Liu X. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10571-10576Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These studies showed that G51V forms chromophore like wild-type rhodopsin (WT), whereas G89D could only form it partially (22Hwa J. Garriga P. Liu X. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10571-10576Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We took these previous studies as a starting point for a detailed characterization of the helical environment of Gly-51 and Gly-89 in transmembrane helices I and II of rhodopsin by analyzing a series of mutants at these positions. In particular, one of the questions we wanted to answer is what is the biochemical defect associated with Type I mutations (like G51V) which allow the protein to fold but still cause the disease. It was stated that the nature of this defect remained enigmatic (27Sung C.-H. Davenport C. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26645-26649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Helices I and II have not received much attention in structural and functional studies because it was thought that they were not involved as major players in the process of rhodopsin activation. It seems clear, however, from the high degree of specificity in helix-helix interactions in rhodopsin that the wealth of information derived from mutagenesis studies is unraveling, making it necessary to address in detail the structural and functional effects of mutating amino acid residues of these helices. In the present work, a series of mutations at the sites of the mutants associated with ADRP, G51A, G51V (helix I), and G89D (helix II) have been constructed and characterized (Fig. 1; Table I). We find that mutations at position 51 are essentially affecting the optimal packing of the helices, with a clear destabilizing effect due to the size of the amino acid substitution. Furthermore, the G51V mutant is defective in signal transduction as a result of an unstable Meta II conformation. This suggests that mutations classified as Type I can be defective in dark state stability and in signal transduction. Mutations at position 89 are, in turn, more affected by the charge of the ionizable residues introduced in the transmembrane domain. The G89D mutant is also defective in transducin (Gt) activation. Altered photointermediate formation, including faster metarhodopsin II (Meta II) decay and increased formation of other non-functional conformations of rhodopsin, like metarhodopsin III (Meta III), is proposed to be physiologically relevant for the mutations associated with ADRP. Overall our results provide evidence for the presence of specific interhelical interactions, in the region delimited by helices I, II and VII in the transmembrane domain of rhodopsin, that are important for the stability and the function of the receptor.Table IAmino acid changes at positions Gly-51 and Gly-89, site of the ADRP mutationsMutations at position 51Gly-51 → Ala (ADRP)Gly-51 → Val (ADRP)Gly-51 → LeuMutations at position 89Gly-89 → AlaGly-89 → LeuGly-89 → PheGly-89 → Asp (ADRP)Gly-89 → Lys Open table in a new tab Materials—Bovine retinas were from J.

For the mutants at position 89 the restriction fragment replaced was BglII-NcoI. The mutant genes were cloned in the pMT4 vector (33Franke R.R. Sakmar T.P. Oprian D.D. Khorana H.G. J. Biol.

Expression and Purification of WT and Mutant Rhodopsins—WT and mutant opsin genes were expressed in transiently transfected monkey kidney cells (COS-1) as described (35Oprian D.D. Molday R.S. Kaufman R.J. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8874-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). After the addition of 5 μm 11-cis-retinal in the dark, the transfected COS-1 cells were solubilized in 1% DM, and the proteins were purified by immunoaffinity chromatography. The purification procedure was carried out as described in detail (21Garriga P. Liu X. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4560-4564Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The expressed proteins were treated to obtain the correctly folded (11-cis-retinal binding) fractions. This was carried out by differential elution from the anti-rhodopsin 1D4-Sepharose resin essentially as previously described (20Liu X. Garriga P. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The folded fractions of these mutant rhodopsins were the ones used throughout the present study. Purity of the immunopurified rhodopsins was assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by silver staining. UV-Visible Absorption Spectra of WT and Mutant Rhodopsin—UV-visible spectra were performed with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences λ-7 spectrophotometer equipped with water-jacketed cuvette holders connected to a circulating water bath. All spectra were recorded with a bandwidth of 2 nm, a response time of 1 s, and a scan speed of 240 nm/min at 20 °C. The molar extinction coefficients were determined as described (37Sakmar T.P. Franke R.R. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 88: 3079-3083Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar). For photobleaching experiments samples were illuminated with a 150-watt fiber optic light (Fiber Lite A-200; Dolan-Jenner, Woburn, MA) equipped with a >495-nm long-pass filter for 10 s, and the corresponding bleached spectrum was recorded immediately after illumination. In the case of mutant G51L, which showed abnormal bleaching, illumination for different lengths of time was carried out after the initial 10-s illumination. Rate of Meta II Decay as Measured by Retinal Release—The rate of retinal release, which parallels the Meta II decay of the protein in the case of WT under the conditions used, was studied using fluorescence spectroscopy essentially as described (38Farrens D.L. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5073-5076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Typically 2 μg of pigment in a volume of 200 μl of 2 mm NaH2PO4, pH 6.0, 0.05% DM (buffer A) was used. For the assay the excitation and emission wavelengths were 295 nm (slit, 0.25 nm) and 330 nm (slit, 12 nm), respectively. The samples were bleached for 30 s, and the fluorescence increase was measured. The assay was also performed in parallel using the same conditions except that the protein was measured in the Gt activation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.1, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.012% DM (Gt assay buffer)) because the assay is known to be sensitive to DM concentration and to pH. This was done to better correlate the Meta II decay data with the Gt activation results. Spectra were recorded at 20 °C. Spectra obtained were normalized and fit to single or double exponential functions using SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific). GtActivation Assay—Gt was prepared from bovine rod outer segments as described (39Ting T.D. Goldin S.B. Ho Y.K. Hargrave P.A. Methods in Neurosciences. 15. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1994: 180-195Google Scholar). Gt activation was measured by means of fluorescence spectroscopy. The fluorescence technique has been applied to the study of rhodopsin mutants (40Fahmy K. Sakmar T.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7229-7236Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 41Jager F. Jager S.

Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). The excitation and emission wavelengths were 295 nm (slit, 2 nm) and 340 nm (slit, 12 nm), respectively. Samples were continuously stirred and maintained at 20 °C. For the assay, rhodopsin (WT or mutants) was photobleached for 30 s with light >495 nm and added to a final concentration of 5 nm to a 400 nm solution of Gt concentration of 5 nm to a 400 nm solution of Gt in Gt assay buffer. After 5 min, GTPγS was added to a final concentration of 5 μm (at t = 0). The relative initial rates of Gt activation were obtained from the slope of the fluorescence increase in the first 60 s after GTPγS addition and normalized to the value of a WT sample used as a control. Expression and Characterization of Mutations at Position 51 in Helix I—Mutants G51A and G51V, associated with ADRP, and the synthetic mutant G51L, expressed in transiently transfected COS-1 cells and purified by immunoaffinity chromatography with rho-1D4 antibody, showed an expression level similar to that of WT. The SDS-PAGE pattern for these mutants was comparable with that of WT, showing a main opsin band at around 40 kDa and the absence of lower bands (not shown), usually associated with misfolded proteins (20Liu X.

The reconstituted mutant rhodopsins eluted in buffer A formed normal chromophore and UV-visible absorption spectra like WT (Fig. 2), with A280/A500 ratios of 1.6–1.7. The absorption spectra for the mutants showed small wavelength shifts in their corresponding visible absorption maxima. G51V had an absorbance maximum slightly red-shifted to 502 nm, whereas G51L had it blue-shifted to 497 nm (Table II). Although the purified mutant proteins folded correctly to a conformation that was able to bind 11-cis-retinal-like WT, thermal stability of the mutants in the dark was severely reduced (Table III). Furthermore, the secondary structure of the proteins was also less stable as measured by circular dichroism (data not shown).Table IIAbsorption maxima and molar extinction coefficients of the WT and the mutant rhodopsinsRhodopsinλmaxϵ500 nmnmM-1 cm-1WT(COS)50040,600G51A50038,900G51V50240,600G51L49739,800G89A50041,200G89L50040,300G89F50041,300G89K500, 35030,900G89D50039,100 Open table in a new tab Table IIIt½ values for the thermal bleaching process of the Gly-51 mutants at 55°C in the darkProteint½ thermal bleachingminWT54.6G51A32.2G51V2.6G51L<1.0 Open table in a new tab The photobleaching behavior of G51A mutant was normal, like that of the WT (data not shown), but that of G51L was clearly altered (Fig. 2, panel D, II). After 10 s of illumination with light >495 nm, in the case of mutant G51L, the 497-nm species was not fully converted to the 380-nm species. Instead, two bands of similar intensity were detected, one at 380 nm and the other one at about 470 nm (trace 2 in Panel D, II, Fig. 2). Further illumination for 30 s or 1 min (traces 3 and 4 in Panel D, II, Fig. 2) only caused a slight decrease of the 470-nm band with a concomitant small increase in the 380-nm band. A very similar behavior was previously seen for G51V (22Hwa J. Garriga P. Liu X. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10571-10576Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Meta II decay, as measured by fluorescence spectroscopy, was faster with increasing size of the amino acid side chain at position 51 (Fig. 3). Thus, G51A and G51V decay curves could be fit to single exponential functions with t½ of 23.2 and 15.7 min, respectively (Table IV). G51L decay, however, could not be fit to a single exponential but to a double exponential function with a very fast component (t½, 0.7 min) and a slow component (t½, 19.8 min). Meta II decay was also measured for the rhodopsin mutant samples in Gt assay buffer (Table IV). Under these experimental conditions, t½ for the decay of G51A was now slightly faster, 18.7 min as compared with 23.2 min in buffer A. However, the decay for the G51V mutant could no longer be fit to a single exponential, and it had to be fit to a double exponential function, with two components, one very fast (t½, 1.9 min) and the other slow (t½, 30.2 min). G51L did not show any significant change in the Meta II decay values obtained in the Gt assay buffer.Table IVt½ life times for retinal release and Gt activation for the WT and mutant rhodopsinsRhodopsint½at½ values for the retinal release were measured using fluorescence spectroscopy as described under “Experimental Procedures” retinal release in buffer At½ retinal release in Gt assay bufferFluorescence Gt activationminminRelative initial ratesbGt activation was measured using fluorescence spectroscopy as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The fluorescence values were obtained from the fitting of the data points from the first 60 s of the curve and normalized to the WT value.

All values are the average of duplicate experiments Open table in a new tab Regarding the ability of these mutants to function normally in signal transduction, G51A could activate Gt to essentially the same level as WT. Mutant G51V, however, showed a very reduced level of Gt activation, which was dependent on the time after bleaching when the protein was added to the Gt reaction mixture (Fig. 4). When the G51V mutant was added to the reaction mixture immediately after bleaching (time 0 in Fig. 4), the maximum activation corresponded to an initial rate about 0.2 that of WT (maximal Gt activation for this mutant, 100% in Fig. 4). When the bleached G51V protein was added after several minutes, the initial rate of the Gt activation was reduced, and after 12 min it was essentially abolished. The curve obtained in Fig. 4 has a t½ of about 2 min, which correlates nicely with the t½ of the fast component of the fluorescence Meta II decay in Gt assay buffer. The G51L mutant did not show any significant degree of activation under any experimental conditions, even upon addition of the protein immediately after bleaching. Expression and Characterization of Mutations at Position 89 in Helix II—Several mutants at position 89, the site of the naturally occurring G89D mutation, were constructed, expressed, and characterized. The mutants studied were G89A, G89L, G89F, G89K, and G89D. The mutant proteins were expressed at similar levels to that of WT in the case of the hydrophobic replacements G89A, G89L, and G89F. Replacements where an ionizable, presumably charged side chain was introduced (G89K and G89D) were expressed at a much lower level, about one-fifth that of the WT. The electrophoretic pattern for the correctly folded fraction of these mutants was WT-like, with the main opsin band at 40 kDa and the characteristic trailing smear (not shown). UV-visible absorption spectra of the mutant proteins eluted in buffer A showed A280/A500 ratios of 1.6–1.8 (Fig. 2). It should be noted that G89A, G89L, and G89F could form chromophore to a similar extent as WT upon elution in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2. The substitutions involving an ionizable amino acid side chain had significantly higher A280/A500 ratios, in the 2.5–2.8 range, indicating that they were eluted as mixtures of folded and misfolded proteins. The separated folded fractions showed A280/A500 ratios of 1.7–1.8 (Fig. 2). UV-visible absorption spectrum in the dark, corresponding to the G89K mutant, showed a clear definite UV-absorbing band centered at 350 nm in addition to the normal chromophoric band at 500 nm. All the other mutants showed a WT-like band in the visible region at 500 nm, and no wavelength shifts were detected. The Meta II decay of G89A, G89L, G89F, and G89K was slightly fas"

Nistri A. Prog. Neurobiol. 1991; 36: 35-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). There, generally, it inhibits neuronal firing and contributes to stabilization of the membrane resting potential by acting on GABA-A, -B, and -C receptors. The term “GABA-C” receptor, which refers to bicuculline- and baclofen-insensitive ionotropic GABA receptors formed by ρ subunits, is controversial, and GABA-C receptors may simply be a subset of GABA-A channels (2Barnard E.A. Skolnick P. Olsen R.W. Mohler H. Sieghart W. Biggio G. Braestrup C. Bateson A.N. Langer S.Z. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 291-313PubMed Google Scholar). GABA-C receptors are located in certain areas of the central nervous system and in the retinas of various species. They form Cl- channels, assumed to organize in either homo- or heteromers of the different ρ subunits (3Enz R. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 1111-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Outside of the central nervous system and retina, the expression of GABA-C receptor subunits was reported based on RT-PCR analysis performed in rat peripheral tissues, namely in gonadal endocrine tissues, adrenal gland, placenta, and small intestine (4Akinci M.K. Schofield P.R. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 35: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and was also found by immunohistochemistry in human neuroendocrine midgut tumor cells (5Jansen A. Hoepfner M. Herzig K.H. Riecken E.O. Scherubl H. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2000; 441: 294-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In these cells, GABA-C receptors were shown to be functional by studying Ca2+i levels and hormone release. In addition, functional GABA-C receptors were also observed in pituitary thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) cells using electrophysiological techniques (6Boue-Grabot E. Taupignon A. Tramu G. Garret M. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1627-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). GABA, produced by growth hormone- (GH) secreting cells (7Mayerhofer A. Hohne-Zell B. Gamel-Didelon K. Jung H.

Neuroendocrinology. 2002; 76: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the present study, we report that GH cells also express GABA-C receptor subunits, which form functional receptors in a rat GH-producing cell line, GH3. Animals—Pituitary glands and brains were obtained from Sprague-Dawley rats bred at the Technische Universität München. They were painlessly killed under ether anesthesia, according to institutional animal care guidelines. The tissues were removed and processed as described previously (7Mayerhofer A. Hohne-Zell B. Gamel-Didelon K. Jung H. Redecker P. Grube D. Urbanski H.F. Gasnier B. Fritschy J.M. Gratzl M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1089-1091PubMed Google Scholar, 8Gamel-Didelon K. Corsi C. Pepeu G. Jung H. Gratzl M.

Culture Procedures of Rat GH3 Cells—The culture procedures applied for GH3 cells were described (8Gamel-Didelon K. Corsi C. Pepeu G. Jung H. Gratzl M. Mayerhofer A. Neuroendocrinology. 2002; 76: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were grown in F12-Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (PAA Laboratories, Linz, Austria). Since GH3 cells produce GABA, the patch clamp and Ca2+ measurements required regular renewal of the medium. Positive recordings were obtained only up to day 6 of culture, when the cells did not yet form a confluent monolayer. Immunohistochemistry and Laser Microdissection of Rat Pituitary Cells—Immunohistochemical methods were performed as described previously (8Gamel-Didelon K. Corsi C. Pepeu G. Jung H. Gratzl M. Mayerhofer A. Neuroendocrinology. 2002; 76: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For staining GH and TSH cells, the following antisera were used: monkey anti-GH (diluted 1:500; courtesy Dr. Parlow, National Hormone and Pituitary Program, Torrance, CA) and rabbit anti-TSH (1:20,000; Chemicon International, Temecula, CA), respectively, and as secondary antibodies, biotin-labeled goat anti-human and goat anti-rabbit (diluted 1:500; Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). The subsequent microdissection of immunostained cells from rat pituitaries was performed using the PALM® Robot-MicroBeam technology (P.A.L.M. GmbH, Bernried, Germany) and following methods described (8Gamel-Didelon K. Corsi C. Pepeu G. Jung H. Gratzl M. Mayerhofer A.

RNA Isolation and RT-PCR—RNA isolation and RT-PCRs from GH3 cells, laser-dissected GH and TSH cells, or rat tissues were performed as reported (8Gamel-Didelon K. Corsi C. Pepeu G. Jung H. Gratzl M. Mayerhofer A. Neuroendocrinology. 2002; 76: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide primers (Table I) were chosen to encompass exon-intron boundaries to detect possible genomic DNA contamination; for amplifying ρ2 cDNA from the laser-dissected samples, nested primers were required. For all experiments, the nature of the amplified cDNAs was confirmed by direct sequencing using one of the oligonucleotide primers (AGOWA, Berlin, Germany).Table IOligonucleotide primers used for PCRNameSequencePositionAccession numberρ1 forward5′-GAAGATCTCCTGCACCTGTGG-3′1257-1277NM_017291ρ1 backward5′-GGTGTTGATCCTCATGCTCAC-3′1470-1450ρ2 forward5′-GGATGGAAGCTACAGTGAATC-3′1299-1319NM_017292ρ2 backward5′-ATCCCTAGGAAAACACTGACC-3′1570-1550Nested-ρ2 forward5′-TGGCTGGCTACCCAAGAAGC-3′1334-1353Nested-ρ2 backward5′-GGCAGGAAATATCAACCTGG-3′1521-1502 Open table in a new tab Immunocytochemistry—GH3 cells were cultivated on glass coverslips (2 × 104 cells/coverslip) for 1 day. They were then fixed and handled as described previously (11Mayerhofer A. Danilchik M. Pau K.Y. Lara H.E. Russell L.D. Ojeda S.R. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 55: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For immunolocalization of GABA-C receptors, a polyclonal antibody produced in rabbit was used (diluted 1:50; courtesy Dr. Enz, Institut für Biochemie, Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, Germany). This antiserum was raised against ρ1 but was shown to recognize ρ2 as well (12Enz R. Brandstatter J.H. Wassle H. Bormann J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4479-4490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoreactivity was visualized using a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary goat antirabbit antiserum (diluted 1:200; Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). For control purposes, either the specific antiserum was omitted or incubations with rabbit normal serum (1:10,000; 1:20,000; 1:40,000) were carried out instead. Sections were examined with a Zeiss Axiovert microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany), equipped with a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set. Patch Clamp Whole Cell Recordings—Patch clamp measurements were performed on GH3 cells grown on glass coverslips for 3–6 days. The cells were voltage-clamped at -80 mV, and whole cell currents were recorded (sampling rate, 100 Hz; low pass filter, 30 Hz) at room temperature (∼22 °C) utilizing an EPC-9 amplifier (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany). Borosilicate patch pipettes (DMZ-Universal Puller; Zeitz, Augsburg, Germany) showed a tip resistance of 3–5 megaohms. The “extracellular” bath solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose (pH 7.4). The pipette solution contained 130 mm KCl, 5 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Calcium Measurements—Ca2+ measurements were performed on GH3 cells, up to day 6 of culture and before reaching confluency, as described (13Fohr K.J. Mayerhofer A. Sterzik K. Rudolf M. Rosenbusch B. Gratzl M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1993; 76: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were loaded with Fura-2/AM (2,5 μm, dissolved in Me2SO) for 30 min at 37 °C in a standard external solution consisting of 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 6 mm glucose, and 12 mm HEPES (pH 7.3). Fluorescence measurements were performed with the Zeiss Fast Fluorescence Photometry System (MPM-FFP, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). The excitation wavelength was switched, at 400 Hz, between 340 and 380 nm using appropriate interference filters (bandwidth, 10 nm). The emitted light (505–530 nm) was monitored after averaging with a final time resolution of 80 ms. Ca2+ levels are given in the figures as fluorescence ratios obtained from alternating excitation at 340 and 380 nm. Drug Application—For both patch clamp and Ca2+ measurements, a combination of global and local bath perfusion was installed that generated a continuous fluid stream containing the agent but confining it to a small volume. Fast pressurized perfusion systems equipped with magnetic valves were used for drug application as described previously (13Fohr K.J. Mayerhofer A. Sterzik K. Rudolf M. Rosenbusch B. Gratzl M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1993; 76: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 14Fritz S. Kunz L. Dimitrijevic N. Grunert R. Heiss C. Mayerhofer A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 1362-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). At each experiment, bath solution was applied first to test for mechanical interference by the mere approaching flow of solutions. GABA, cis-4-aminocrotonic acid (CACA), bicuculline, and baclofen (Tocris, Ellisville, MO) were utilized at a concentration of 100 μm as reported previously (6Boue-Grabot E. Taupignon A. Tramu G. Garret M. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1627-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Expression of GABA-C Receptors in Rat Pituitary GH Cells and in GH3 Cells—GABA-C receptors are present outside the central nervous system and retina, for example in the pituitary gland. There, TSH cells were shown to possess functional GABA-C channels (6Boue-Grabot E. Taupignon A. Tramu G. Garret M. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1627-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used TSH cells as a reference for our experiments. Rat pituitary sections were immunostained either for GH or for TSH and subsequently submitted to laser microdissection followed by RT-PCR experiments (Fig. 1). GH and TSH immunoreactive cells were harvested (Fig. 1A), RNA was extracted, and nested RT-PCRs for ρ2 were performed (Fig. 1B). Since additional tissue surrounds the cells of interest after microdissection, control samples in which GH/TSH immunoreactive cells were destroyed by laser shots before excision were also analyzed. The ρ2 subunit was detected in GH cells and, as expected, in TSH cells, but not in the controls. GH3 cells are derived from a rat GH pituitary adenoma (15Tashjian Jr., A.H. Bancroft F.C. Levine L. J. Cell Biol. 1970; 47: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and are widely used as a model for the study of pituitary somatotrophs. We examined whether GH3 cells also possess GABA-C receptors. RT-PCR experiments identified ρ1 and ρ2 subunit mRNAs in GH3 cells (Fig. 2A). GABA-C receptor protein at GH3 cell membranes was shown by immunocytochemistry (Fig. 2B). The antiserum, which recognizes both ρ1 and ρ2, showed a staining, which was confined to the plasma membrane of the cells (Fig. 2B, left panel). Omitting the antiserum resulted in a weak homogeneous staining pattern (Fig. 2B, right panel). Further controls were performed by incubating the cells with rabbit normal serum (dilutions ranging from 1:10,000 to 1:40,000). These experiments led to a homogeneous nonspecific staining within the cells (data not shown) and argue for the specificity of the membrane-associated immunoreactivity obtained using the anti-GABA-C receptor antiserum. Electrophysiology of GABA-C Receptors in GH3 Cells—The whole cell patch clamp technique was applied to single GH3 cells to test the functionality of the putative GABA-C receptors. Application of 100 μm GABA induced an inward whole cell current at a holding potential of -80 mV in about 70% of the cells (n = 13; Fig. 3A). The GABA-induced current was rapidly and almost completely desensitizing during GABA application. GABA was also capable of eliciting the current in the presence of the GABA-A antagonist bicuculline (n = 4; 100 μm; Fig. 3C), even when bicuculline was applied about 1 min prior to GABA. There was no significant difference between the maximum amplitudes (paired t test) for 100 μm GABA (0.8 ± 0.3 pA/picofarads; mean ± S.D.) and for 100 μm GABA + 100 μm bicuculline (0.9 ± 0.8 pA/picofarads). The channel giving rise to the GABA-induced Cl- current was identified as GABA-C receptor because of its activation by the specific GABA-C receptor agonist CACA (100 μm) in all GABA-sensitive cells tested (n = 6; Fig. 3B). The specific peak current activated by GABA or CACA was in the range of 0.5–5.0 pA/picofarads and thereby comparable with the GABA-C current observed in TSH cells (6Boue-Grabot E. Taupignon A. Tramu G. Garret M. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1627-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Activation of the current by GABA or CACA was repeatable several times in the same cell after washing with agonist-free bath solution for about 2 min (Fig. 3, A and B). The peak amplitude did not decrease in the course of the experiment in contrast to the rundown of the GABA-C receptor currents reported in TSH cells (6Boue-Grabot E. Taupignon A. Tramu G. Garret M. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1627-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The Activation of GABA-C Receptors Provokes Intracellular Ca2+Transients—We performed fluorimetric measurements of cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations in GH3 cells (Fig. 4). Both GABA and the GABA-C-specific agonist CACA (100 μm of each) induced Ca2+ transients of similar amplitude (n = 9 cells). However, the use of baclofen (GABA-B receptors agonist) did not lead to Ca2+ transients (data not shown). The Ca2+ transients recorded in GH3 cells using either GABA or CACA are most probably due to Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (16Safa P. Boulter J. Hales T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38727-38737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Indeed, both KCl- and GABA-induced Ca2+ transients are almost completely blocked by Gd3+ (500 μM), a blocker of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (preliminary studies, data not shown). In this study, the expression of GABA-C receptors is reported in endocrine cells, namely in the pituitary GH cells and in their corresponding cell line, GH3. These receptors are functional in GH3 cells: the current induced by GABA or by the typical GABA-C agonist, CACA, is characterized by its insensitivity to the GABA-A antagonist bicuculline and by its quick desensitization. The opening of GABA-C channels may induce a membrane depolarization as suggested by an increase in Ca2+i levels measured by fluorometry on GH3 cells. In the pituitary gland, all types of GABA receptors are expressed (7Mayerhofer A. Hohne-Zell B. Gamel-Didelon K. Jung H. Redecker P. Grube D. Urbanski H.F. Gasnier B. Fritschy J.M. Gratzl M.

Tramu G. Garret M. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1627-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore, these cells served as positive controls in our study. We detected the ρ2 subunit in GH and, as expected, in TSH cells. Boue-Grabot et al. (6Boue-Grabot E. Taupignon A. Tramu G. Garret M. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1627-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) showed that TSH cells possess functional GABA-C channels, reported the absence of ρ1 in follicle-stimulating hormone, adrenocorticotropin, and prolactin cells, but did not investigate GH cells. By identifying ρ2 in TSH and GH cells, we confirm and extend their results. We verified by RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry that GH3 cells also express GABA-C receptors. Then, performing patch clamp recordings on single GH3 cells, we could prove functional GABA-C receptors. The application of either GABA or CACA (100 μm of each) induced a Cl- current insensitive to bicuculline, exhibiting an untypical fast desensitization but lacking rundown. Similar inactivating GABA-C currents were observed in rat TSH cells (6Boue-Grabot E. Taupignon A. Tramu G. Garret M. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1627-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) but also in bipolar cells of the carp retina (22Han M.H. Li Y. Yang X.L. Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 1331-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Usually, GABA-C receptor activation is regarded to entail sustained Cl- currents (23Enz R. Cutting G.R. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 24Polenzani L. Woodward R.M. Miledi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neurobiol. 1998; 37: 305-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) in contrast to the typically desensitizing GABA-A receptor (26Levitan E.S. Blair L.A. Dionne V.E. Barnard E.A. Neuron. 1988; 1: 773-781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 27Shields C.R. Tran M.N. Wong R.O. Lukasiewicz P.D. J.

Most likely, variations in the subunit composition (29Qian H. Dowling J.E. Ripps H. J. Neurobiol. 1999; 40: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), species-dependent protein sequence differences, or/and tissue-specific splicing variants (6Boue-Grabot E. Taupignon A. Tramu G. Garret M. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1627-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) account for these different properties. In addition, we reported previously the presence of the GABA-A receptor subunit γ2 in rat GH cells (7Mayerhofer A. Hohne-Zell B. Gamel-Didelon K. Jung H. Redecker P. Grube D. Urbanski H.F. Gasnier B. Fritschy J.M. Gratzl M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1089-1091PubMed Google Scholar). The possibility that heterooligomerization might occur among ρ and GABA-A subunits is under debate (30Hackam A.S. Wang T.L. Guggino W.B. Cutting G.R. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 31Pan Z.H. Zhang D. Zhang X. Lipton S.A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 3137-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and may also explain various electrogenic profiles. In this report, we show that pituitary GH cells express GABA-C receptors and that they are functional in a corresponding tumor cell line, GH3. What could be the physiological role of GABA-C receptors in GH-secreting cells? A gut neuroendocrine tumor cell line STC-1 was also shown to possess functional GABA-C receptors (5Jansen A. Hoepfner M. Herzig K.H. Riecken E.O. Scherubl H. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2000; 441: 294-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 6Boue-Grabot E. Taupignon A. Tramu G. Garret M. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1627-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In STC-1 cells, GABA increases Ca2+i levels by acting on GABA-C receptors. It is also known that the activation of GABA-B receptors influences Ca2+i concentrations in neurons (32Couve A. Moss S.J. Pangalos M.N. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2000; 16: 296-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Since GH3 cells bear functional GABA-B receptors as well (8Gamel-Didelon K. Corsi C. Pepeu G. Jung H. Gratzl M. Mayerhofer A. Neuroendocrinology. 2002; 76: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), one can suppose that GABA may control Ca2+i levels via both metabotropic and ionotropic mechanisms. To test this hypothesis, we performed fluorimetric measurements of cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations in GH3 cells. We showed that both GABA and CACA (100 μm of each) induced Ca2+ transients of similar amplitude. However, preliminary experiments using baclofen (a GABA-B receptor agonist) did not result in Ca2+ transients. These observations argue for a control of Ca2+i levels by GABA via ionotropic routes. A possible mechanistic explanation for the Ca2+ transients can be deduced from results obtained in developing neurons. There, GABA acts as a trophic substance. Via GABA-A channels, GABA can depolarize the cell membrane when the Cl- reversal potential is positive to the resting membrane potential (33Ben Ari Y. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 728-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (1805) Google Scholar, 34Cherubini E. Martina M. Sciancalepore M. Strata F. Perspect. Dev. Neurobiol. 1998; 5: 289-304PubMed Google Scholar, 35Jentsch T.J. Stein V. Weinreich F. Zdebik A.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 503-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). Thus, it can provoke Ca2+ transients via the activation of voltage-operated Ca2+ channels (5Jansen A. Hoepfner M. Herzig K.H. Riecken E.O. Scherubl H. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2000; 441: 294-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 36Kullmann P.H. Ene F.A. Kandler K. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 15: 1093-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ transients recorded in GH3 cells, using either GABA or CACA, are most probably due to Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (16Safa P. Boulter J. Hales T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38727-38737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Indeed, preliminary results showed that both KCl- and GABA-induced Ca2+ transients are almost completely blocked by Gd3+ (500 μM), a blocker of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. We propose that GABA action on GABA-C receptors leads to membrane depolarization and Ca2+ influx in GH3 cells, suggesting an excitatory function of GABA in endocrine cells. In summary, the presence of multiple GABA receptor subtypes in GH cells, with different properties and GABA sensitivities, suggests that GABA may have several functions in these cells (e.g. regulation of chloride conductance, membrane potential, control of Ca2+i concentrations, modulation of hormone secretion). Our present results are in accordance with recent reports indicating new roles of neurotransmitters, including GABA, in various nonneuronal tissues. This is best illustrated in the pancreas, where the neurotransmitter glutamate is secreted by α-cells and triggers the Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of GABA from β-cells. Once secreted, GABA in turn binds to GABA-A receptors on α-cells, where it acts as a paracrine inhibitor for glucagon secretion (37Hayashi M. Yamada H. Uehara S. Morimoto R. Muroyama A. Yatsushiro S. Takeda J. Yamamoto A. Moriyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1966-1974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thus, signaling molecules originally thought to be restricted to the central nervous system appear to be produced and active in important endocrine systems, namely the anterior pituitary and the pancreas. We thank all our colleagues, in particular Barbara Zschiesche, Andreas Mauermayer, and Marlies Rauchfuss. We are grateful to Dr. Ralf Enz for the generous gift of anti-GABA-C antiserum and to Prof. Enrico Cherubini and Dr. Frédéric Didelon for expert advice.

https://openalex.org/W1983098541,"Recently, we have shown that autocrine transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α) controls the expression of integrin α2, cell adhesion to collagen IV and motility in highly progressed HCT116 colon cancer cells (Sawhney, R. S., Zhou, G-H. K., Humphrey, L. E., Ghosh, P., Kreisberg, J. I., and Brattain, M. G. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 75–86). We now report that expression of basal integrin α2 and its biological effects are controlled by constitutive activation of the extracellular signal-regulated/mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK/MAPK) pathway. Treatment of cells with selective mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors PD098059 and U0126 showed that integrin α2 expression, cell adhesion, and activation of ERK are inhibited in a parallel concentration-dependent fashion. Moreover, autocrine TGF-α-mediated epidermal growth factor receptor activation was shown to control the constitutive activation of the ERK/MAPK pathway, since neutralizing antibody to the epidermal growth factor receptor was able to block basal ERK activity. TGF-α antisense-transfected cells also showed attenuated activation of ERK. Using a real time electric cell impedance sensing technique, it was shown that ERK-dependent integrin α2-mediated cell micromotion signaling is controlled by autocrine TGF-α. Thus, this study implicates ERK/MAPK signaling activated by endogenous TGF-α as one of the mechanistic features controlling metastatic spread. Recently, we have shown that autocrine transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α) controls the expression of integrin α2, cell adhesion to collagen IV and motility in highly progressed HCT116 colon cancer cells (Sawhney, R. S., Zhou, G-H. K., Humphrey, L. E., Ghosh, P., Kreisberg, J. I., and Brattain, M. G. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 75–86). We now report that expression of basal integrin α2 and its biological effects are controlled by constitutive activation of the extracellular signal-regulated/mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK/MAPK) pathway.

We have recently shown that constitutive endogenous activation of the EGFr by TGF-α provides a critical growth and survival advantage to colon cancer cells (1Jiang D. Liang J. Humphrey L.E. Yang H. Brattain M.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 175: 174-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 2Venkateswarlu S. Dawson D.M. St. Clair P. Gupta A. Willson J.K.V. Brattain M.G. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Similarly, it is conceivable that human colon cancer cells involved in metastasis may derive an advantage in cell motility from a strong autocrine TGF-α loop, because the initial number of cells contributing to metastatic behavior is small. Recently, we showed that in HCT116 cells, the DNA synthesis response is saturated by a relatively low EGFr occupation resulting from autocrine TGF-α (3Sawhney R.S. Zhou G.-H.K. Humphrey L.E. Ghosh P. Kreisberg J.I. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 75-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The expression level of integrin α2 and its functions, on the other hand, show a much wider window of response, increasing from low EGFr occupation by autocrine TGF-α to saturation by complete receptor occupation with exogenous EGF. The initiation of this response at low level receptor occupation was shown by its attenuation with treatment by an EGFr blocking antibody that inhibits basal EGFr activation resulting from autocrine TGF-α as well as by stable transfection with a TGF-α antisense cDNA to inhibit basal EGFr activation in HCT116 cells. We also observed that the addition of exogenous EGF results in further EGFr activation, which is associated with higher expression of integrin α2, enhanced cell adhesion, and micromotility. Thus, there is a difference in response windows based on the extent of EGFr activation. While the activation of EGFr was demonstrated to be critical to α2 integrin-mediated adhesion and motility, the EGFr-mediated downstream mechanism(s) and the intracellular pathways that control autocrine TGF-α-mediated cell adhesion and motility remain unclear. In the present study, selective pharmacological inhibitors of signaling intermediates have been used to link cell signaling to integrin α2 expression, cell adhesion, and motility in HCT116 colon cancer cells. This cell line has been shown to generate liver metastases when implanted orthotopically in athymic nude mice (4Bresalier R.S. Raper S.E. Hujanen E.S. Kim Y.S. Int. J. Cancer. 1987; 39: 625-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 5Bresalier R.S. Hujanen E.S. Raper S.E. Roll F.J. Itzkowitz S.H. Martin G.R. Kim Y.S.

The link between metastases and motility suggests that endogenous TGF-α also has a role in the control of metastatic tumor formation. The binding of a growth factor to its receptor may result in the activation of multiple signaling pathways, including the superfamily of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)/extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) (7Rigot V. Lehmann M. Andre F. Daemi N. Marvaldi J. Luis J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3119-3127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Martin-Blanco E. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Our work shows that in highly malignant growth factor-independent, metastatic HCT116 colon cancer cells, ERK plays an important role mediating endogenous cellular control of integrin α2 expression, cell adhesion, and motility. This study implicates ERK activated by endogenous TGF-α as one of the mechanistic features controlling metastatic spread.

Cell Culture and Adhesion Assay—These experiments were performed as described previously (3Sawhney R.S. Zhou G.-H.K. Humphrey L.E. Ghosh P. Kreisberg J.I. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 75-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). HCT 116 cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 in chemically defined serum-free medium consisting of McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 4 μg/ml transferrin and 20 μg/ml insulin either in the absence or presence of EGF (10 ng/ml) depending upon experimental conditions. For adhesion assays, 96-well tissue culture plates were coated overnight at room temperature with CN IV at concentrations of 0–0.25 μg/ml, blocked with 3% BSA in PBS for 3 h, and then rinsed once with PBS. Subsequently, the colorimetric MTT procedure was followed as described previously (3Sawhney R.S. Zhou G.-H.K. Humphrey L.E. Ghosh P. Kreisberg J.I. Brattain M.G. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 936-942PubMed Google Scholar). After trypsinization, cells were incubated at 37 °C with inhibitors for 3 h to determine autocrine TGF-α- or exogenous EGF-mediated cell adhesion functions. Cells were plated at 6 × 104 cells/well on CN IV-coated plates and incubated for 90 min in the absence or presence of MEK inhibitors PD098059 and U0126. Nonadherent cells were removed by washing three times with serum-free medium. The relative number of attached cells was determined by the MTT method. All inhibitors were dissolved in Me2SO as stock solutions and diluted at the time of experiment. Cell Lysates, Biotinylation, and Immunoblotting—The procedures were the same as described previously (3Sawhney R.S. Zhou G.-H.K. Humphrey L.E. Ghosh P. Kreisberg J.I. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 75-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, subconfluent cultures of HCT116 cells were treated either with Joklik's EDTA for 8 min or trypsinized for 3 min at room temperature, and subsequently cells were scraped and pelleted by centrifugation in a clinical centrifuge for 3 min at 800 × g. The pellet was washed twice with cold PBS, and cells were biotinylated in suspension with NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce), 0.1 mg/ml in Me2SO at room temperature for 1 h. The biotinylated cells for integrins were washed with PBS and lysed in buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, and a mixture of protease inhibitors) by shearing them through a 26-gauge needle and centrifuging at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. Equal amounts of protein from treated and untreated (control) cell lysates were incubated with streptavidin-agarose for 90 min at 4 °C. Agarose beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 4 °C and subsequently washed five times with lysis buffer containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The beads were boiled in 2× Laemmli buffer containing 4% β-mercaptoethanol for 8 min, and supernatant was filtered through Bio-Rad columns and analyzed by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond), and the membrane was blocked for 2–3 h with 5% nonfat dry milk in Triton Tris-buffered saline and subsequently incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody. After washing the membrane three times with Triton Tris-buffered saline, it was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit or mouse secondary antibody. The membrane was washed twice, and detection of specific protein was achieved by using enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For Western blot analysis of cell signaling proteins, biotinylation of cells was omitted, and proteins were separated by either 7.5 or 10% SDS-PAGE. Transfection of TGF-α Antisense Cells with Activated ERK1 DNA— TGF-α antisense cells were transfected with ERK1 DNA using Fu-GENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, ∼1 × 106 cells were seeded in 100-mm tissue culture plates in chemically defined serum-free medium 3 days before transfection and changed to serum-free medium devoid of EGF on the third day. The cells were transfected with activated MEK1 DNA, a gift of Drs. Weber and Slack-Davis (10Catling A.D. Schaeffer H.J. Reuter C.W. Reddy G.R. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5214-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) at a 4:1 ratio of FuGENE to plasmid DNA. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the medium was replaced. Sixty-two hours after transfection, cells were harvested and cell lysates were prepared as described earlier. The cell lysates were analyzed for ERK activation and integrin α2 protein expression by Western blot. RNase Protection Assay—Total cellular RNA was isolated from control or treated HCT116 cells by lysing cells with the Trizol reagent following the supplier's protocol (11Chomczynski P. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 532-537PubMed Google Scholar). Equivalent amounts of RNA samples (40 μg) were used in RNase protection assays. The α2 subunit template was constructed by subcloning a 292-base pair ECoR V-Hinc II fragment of the human α2 subunit cDNA into plasmid PBSK (-). A high specific activity α2 subunit riboprobe was synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase, whereas actin antisense probe was prepared by Sρ6-RNA polymerase in the presence of [32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences). Normalization of sample loading was assessed as previously described (3Sawhney R.S. Zhou G.-H.K. Humphrey L.E. Ghosh P. Kreisberg J.I. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 75-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Determination of Cell Surface Integrin α2by Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter Analysis—HCT116 cells either were treated with Me2SO, PD098059 (25 μm), or U0126 (10 μm) for 48h. The cells were harvested with Joklik's EDTA and washed once in culture medium. For each experimental condition, ∼1 × 106 cells were pelleted and fixed in 2% formaldehyde at 4 °C overnight. The cells were washed twice with a cold 1% BSA in PBS solution. Cells were resuspended in 0.25 ml of cold 0.1% BSA in PBS and incubated with the primary antibody (IgG1 and P1E6; 1:50 dilution) for 45 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed three times with 1% BSA in PBS, resuspended in 0.1% BSA in PBS, and incubated with a secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate antibody (1:100 dilution) for 45 min on ice in the dark. The cells were washed twice with 1% BSA in PBS, resuspended in PBS, and maintained on ice. Cells were analyzed on a Becton-Dickinson FACScan Analyzer using CellQuest and WinList software. Cell Motility Measurements by the Electrical Cell Impedance Sensor (ECIS) Technique—These experiments were performed as described previously (3Sawhney R.S. Zhou G.-H.K. Humphrey L.E. Ghosh P. Kreisberg J.I. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 75-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, to determine cell motion, HCT116 cells were plated at 4 × 104 cells/well on small active gold electrodes (diameter, 250 μm) at the bottom of tissue culture wells (area, 0.5 cm2) (12Wegener J. Keese C.R. Giaever I. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 259: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 13Giaever I. Keese C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7896-7900Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 14Giaever I. Keese C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3761-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Four hundred microliters of medium, which served as an electrolyte, were used per well. Depending on the experimental design, arrays consisting of either five or eight individual small electrodes were used. In these measurements, a 1-μA, 4-kHz AC signal from a constant current source was applied between the small electrode and a much larger counter electrode (0.15 cm2). This signal was too weak to disturb the cells or to change cell behavior (12Wegener J. Keese C.R. Giaever I. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 259: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). The voltage of the system was monitored by a lock-in amplifier, which can detect both magnitude and phase of the voltage appearing across the sample. The in-phase and out-of-phase voltages across the electrode were recorded by the lock-in amplifier once every second for measuring micromotion. The ECIS software (Applied BioPhysics, Troy, NY) calculated the impedance (resistance and capacitance) values of the electrode over a designated period of time. The movement of the cells on the active electrode interfered with the flow of the current, resulting in fluctuations in the electrode impedance. These real time cellular movements were called micromotion (13Giaever I. Keese C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7896-7900Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar) and were a measure of the motile ability of the cells under investigation. As the cells moved on the gold electrode, the sensitive nature of the lock-in amplifier detected the fluctuations in the resistance and capacitance values of impedance (14Giaever I. Keese C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3761-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). These fluctuations were then statistically analyzed by the ECIS software, thus revealing the percentage variation in resistance, which in turn was a reflection of cellular micromotion on the electrode (14Giaever I. Keese C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3761-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). The technique is real time, quantitative, and completely automated. ERK/MAPK Activity Is Induced by Endogenous and Exogenous EGFr Ligands—Since ERK/MAPK is a downstream effector of EGFr-mediated signaling, cells were suspended and then incubated at 37 °C for 20 min in the absence or presence of exogenous EGF. Both ERK-1 (44 kDa) and ERK-2 (42 kDa) activities were enhanced by endogenous and exogenous ligands as determined by Western blot analyses using a mAb against the active phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK). In the upper panel (Fig. 1A), a Western blot of ERK using anti-phospho antibodies is shown, whereas the lower panel shows total ERK. Densitometric quantitation showed that endogenous ligand increased ERK activation about 80%, whereas exogenous EGF enhanced ERK activation about 230%, as compared with the control (Fig. 1B). Constitutive ERK Activation through Endogenous TGF-α-mediated EGFr Activation—Previously, we showed that mAb 528 inhibited autocrine TGF-α-mediated EGFr activation and cell adhesion in HCT116 cells (3Sawhney R.S. Zhou G.-H.K. Humphrey L.E. Ghosh P. Kreisberg J.I. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 75-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To further define the role of activated ERK as a downstream event of EGFr activation, HCT116 cells were treated with EGFr-blocking mAb 528, and its effect on ERK levels was observed by Western blot analysis. The anti-EGFr antibody mAb 528 was effective in blocking activation of ERK in cells maintained in the absence of EGF. Fig. 2A shows that mAb 528 inhibited phosphorylation of ERK as compared with control HCT116 cells. The antibody did not have any effect on total ERK. The results indicate that autocrine TGF-α contributes to ERK/MAPK signaling. If TGF-α were acting in an autocrine manner to effect ERK activation, it would be expected that anti-TGF-α antisense-transfected cells would block activation of ERK relative to parental HCT116 cells. We have previously used well characterized HCT116 cells stably transfected with a full-length antisense TGF-α cDNA to show that the TGF-α antisense mRNA can be detected in these stably transfected cells (15Howell G.M. Humphrey L.E. Ziober B.L. Awwad R. Periyasamy B. Koterba A. Li W. Willson J.K.V. Coleman K. Carboni J. Lynch M. Brattain M.G. Mol. Cell.

Physiol. 1995; 162: 256-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The antisense mRNA forms duplexes with the sense TGF-α mRNA, which results in the reduced steady state of TGF-α mRNA but not of other genes (16Howell G.M. Ziober B.L. Humphrey L.E. Willson J.K.V. Sun L.-Z. Lynch M. Brattain M.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 162: 256-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). All of these effects as well as the biological effects (loss of tumorigenicity, gain of dependence on exogenous EGFr ligand for DNA synthesis, and cell proliferation) are reversed when the antisense mRNA is lost by revertant transfected cells or by the addition of exogenous ligand. Similarly, we have previously shown that exogenous EGFr ligand rescues the effects of TGF-α antisense transfection on basal steady state integrin α2 expression as well on the subsequent steady state cell adhesion and micromotility properties (3Sawhney R.S. Zhou G.-H.K. Humphrey L.E. Ghosh P. Kreisberg J.I. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 75-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The TGF-α antisense transfected cells were used to characterize autocrine TGF-α effects on ERK. Fig. 2B (lane 1) shows activation of ERK in parental HCT116 cells in the absence of exogenous EGF, whereas lane 2 exhibits attenuation of ERK activation in HCT116 TGF-α antisense transfected cells showing that ERK activation is sensitive to TGF-α antisense expression. Furthermore, the decreased activation of ERK was rescued by treating TGF-α antisense cells with exogenous EGF, showing that reactivation of EGFr rescues the antisense effect. However, levels of total ERK were not altered. These results are consistent with the effects of EGFr blocking mAb 528 on ERK phosphorylation in HCT116 cells. To demonstrate that the decrease in integrin α2 expression in TGF-α antisense cells can be rescued by overexpressing ERK, we transfected TGF-α antisense cells with constitutively activated MEK1 (10Catling A.D. Schaeffer H.J. Reuter C.W. Reddy G.R. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5214-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The activation of ERK and expression of integrin α2 was analyzed by immunoblotting. Fig. 2C shows that by constitutively overexpressing ERK in TGF-α antisense transfected cells, inhibition of integrin α2 is rescued. Fig. 2C (upper panel) shows activation of ERK in antisense cells (lane 1), whereas lane 2 shows activation of ERK in MEK1-transfected cells. Fig. 2C (lower panel) shows expression of integrin α2 in TGF-α antisense cells (lane 1), whereas lane 2 shows expression of integrin α2 in MEK1-transfected antisense cells. PD098059 and U0126 Inhibit Cell Adhesion, Integrin α2Expression, and ERK Activation in a Parallel Fashion—Because ERK can be activated by EGFr signaling, we determined whether autocrine TGF-α contributes to cell adhesion functions via ERK activation in HCT116 cells. We utilized highly selective MEK inhibitors to further define the role of the MAPK pathway in the control of integrin α2 and its functions (17Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R.

Treatment with PD098059 or U0126 selectively inhibits MEK activity, which is responsible for phosphorylation and activation of ERK. PD098059 inhibits MEK1, whereas U0126 is an inhibitor of MEK1 and -2. Both inhibitors were effective for inhibition of cell adhesion (Fig. 3). The effect of PD098059 on CN IV-mediated adhesion in the absence of exogenous EGF on cell adhesion was characterized. Inhibition of adhesion (35–67%) by different concentrations of the drug indicated that basal control of cell adhesion on CN IV is mediated by endogenous MAPK activation (Fig. 3A). HCT116 cells showed 33–67% inhibition of cell adhesion to CN IV (in the absence of exogenous EGF) when incubated with MEK inhibitor U0126 relative to Me2SO-treated controls under identical conditions (Fig. 3B). The inhibitory effect of MEK inhibitors on cell adhesion was directly correlated with reduced expression of integrin α2, both at the protein and mRNA levels, as shown by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4A) and by an RNase protection assay (Fig. 4B).Fig. 4A (left panel), effect of MEK inhibitors on expression of integrin α2. HCT116 cells were treated with different concentrations of PD098059 and U0126 for 48 h.

Substrates were prepared by coating tissue culture 96-well plates with CN IV at a concentration of 0.025 μg/ml overnight at room temperature. Cells were seeded at 6 × 104 cells/well onto coated plates and incubated for 90 min at 37 °C. The relative number of attached cells was determined by MTT assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the effect of MEK inhibitors on functional cell surface integrin α2 expression, cells were treated with MEK inhibitors (U0126 and PD098059) or with the Me2SO vehicle alone. The effect of the inhibitors was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis with integrin α2-specific (P1E6) functional antibodies. Fig. 4C shows that both MEK inhibitors induce a loss of cell surface integrin α2 expression. To confirm that MEK activation was directly related to ERK activation under these conditions, cells were incubated with MEK inhibitors, and cell lysates were analyzed for ERK activation by Western blot analysis. The constitutive activation of ERK is inhibited by MEK inhibitors in a concentration-dependent fashion (Fig. 5, A and B). Inhibition of activation of ERK by a MEK inhibitor in the absence of EGF shows endogenous control of integrin functions via ERK. The inhibitors did not affect levels of nonphosphorylated ERK.

https://openalex.org/W2002440238,"Limitations of current anticoagulant therapies have led us to develop two distinct classes of exosite peptide inhibitors for the initiator of the clotting process, the tissue factor-factor VIIa (TF·FVIIa) complex (Roberge, M., Santell, L., Dennis, M. S., Eigenbrot, C., Dwyer, M. A., and Lazarus, R. A. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 9522–9531). Although both peptide classes are potent and selective inhibitors of TF·FVIIa, neither showed 100% inhibition at saturating concentrations. Crystal structures of these peptides in complex with the FVII/FVIIa protease domain revealed their distinct binding sites and close proximity to the active site. The favorable orientation of the 15-mer A-site peptide A-183 (EEWEVLCWTWETCER) suggested that a C-terminal extension into the FVIIa active site could yield a chimeric inhibitor that was not only potent and selective but complete as well. A novel two-step “protease switch” approach using substrate phage display was developed by first binding all phage containing A-183 and C-terminal extension libraries to immobilized and inactive FVIIa. Upon altering pH and adding TF to switch on FVIIa enzymatic activity, only those phage released by proteolytic cleavage within the extension were propagated. This process selected for both preferred sequence and length in the extension, leading to a 27-mer peptide A-183X (EEWEVLCWTWETCERGEGVEEELWEWR) with a C-terminal 12-mer extension containing an Arg in the P1 position. A-183X was a more potent and complete inhibitor of FX activation, having a maximal extent of inhibition of ∼99% with an IC50 of 230 pmversus A-183 which maximally inhibited to 74% with an IC50 of 1.5 nm. A-183X also had a maximal prolongation of the prothrombin time of 7.6- versus 1.9-fold for A-183, making it a more effective anticoagulant. Limitations of current anticoagulant therapies have led us to develop two distinct classes of exosite peptide inhibitors for the initiator of the clotting process, the tissue factor-factor VIIa (TF·FVIIa) complex (Roberge, M., Santell, L., Dennis, M. S., Eigenbrot, C., Dwyer, M. A., and Lazarus, R. A. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 9522–9531).

The limitations of current anticoagulant therapies have stimulated the search for new alternatives based on selective inhibition of serine proteases in the coagulation pathway (1Lazarus R.A. Kirchhofer D. Smith H.J. Simons C. Proteinase and Peptidase Inhibition: Recent Potential Targets for Drug Development. Taylor & Francis Ltd., London2002: 202-230Google Scholar, 2Moll S. Roberts H.R.

Uprichard A.C.G. Gallagher K.P. Antithrombotics. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1999: 1-39Google Scholar). Commonly used anticoagulants, such as coumarin and heparin, lack specificity and have a narrow therapeutic window, leading to undesirable side effects such as bleeding. The tightly regulated coagulation cascade consists of several highly homologous serine proteases and their cofactors and inhibitors (5Davie E.W. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 6Mann K.G. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The development of a specific inhibitor for a single coagulation factor could reduce side effects and improve the therapeutic profile. The architecture of the active site in all these proteases is very similar, which makes the development of a specific small molecule active site inhibitor challenging. Although relatively nonselective with respect to small chromogenic substrates, these proteases are highly specific for their natural macromolecular substrates. In order to achieve this, exosites on these enzymes play an important role in substrate recognition and catalysis (7Baugh R.J. Dickinson C.D. Ruf W. Krishnaswamy S. Biochemistry. 2000; 275: 28826-28833Google Scholar, 8Shobe J. Dickinson C.D. Edgington T.S. Ruf W. J. Biol.

Upon vascular damage, zymogen FVII binds to tissue factor (TF), a membrane-bound protein cofactor that is expressed in the surrounding tissue (13Morrissey J.H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). This results in the formation of the active complex TF·FVIIa, which activates FX to FXa, FIX to FIXa, and FVII to FVIIa through specific proteolytic cleavages. Ultimately, this cascade leads to the generation of thrombin, resulting in the formation of fibrin and eventually a blood clot. Because FVII/FVIIa is present only in relatively low concentrations in blood (10 nm) and it initiates the coagulation cascade (13Morrissey J.H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), this enzyme is an attractive drug target for the development of anticoagulants.Recent focus on the search for specific inhibitors has lead to the development of two new classes of exosite peptide inhibitors of human FVIIa (14Dennis M.S. Eigenbrot C. Skelton N.J. Ultsch M.H. Santell L. Dwyer M.A. O'Connell M.P. Lazarus R.A. Nature. 2000; 404: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 15Dennis M.S. Roberge M. Quan C.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9522-9531Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These cyclic peptide classes, termed E-series and A-series, are typified by the 18-mer E-76 and the 15-mer A-183 (EEWEVLCWTWETCER), respectively. They bind tightly to two distinct exosites on the protease domain of FVIIa and potently inhibit the activation of FX to FXa by TF·FVIIa with IC50 values in the single digit nanomolar range. Similar potency was observed for the inhibition of the amidolytic activity of TF·FVIIa. Although these peptides were potent inhibitors of TF·FVIIa, their inhibition was incomplete. At saturating concentrations, E-76 and A-183 showed a maximal extent of inhibition of FX activation of 90 and 78%, respectively, whereas the maximal extent of inhibition of the amidolytic activity was 50 and 32%, respectively. The partial inhibition by these exosite peptides has been explained by their mechanisms of inhibition involving both allosteric effects on the active site of FVIIa as well as steric hindrance with the substrate FX (14Dennis M.S. Eigenbrot C. Skelton N.J. Ultsch M.H. Santell L. Dwyer M.A. O'Connell M.P. Lazarus R.A. Nature. 2000; 404: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 15Dennis M.S. Roberge M. Quan C.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9522-9531Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).The extent of inhibition of the A-series peptides correlated with the degree of anticoagulant activity determined by prolongation of the TF-dependent prothrombin time (PT) (15Dennis M.S. Roberge M. Quan C. Lazarus R.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9513-9521Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Whereas partial inhibition and moderate PT prolongation has some potential advantages, more complete inhibition may be required to achieve effective anticoagulation in vivo. We recently pursued one strategy to obtain more complete inhibition by linking the A- and E-series peptides together to make fusion peptides (17Roberge M. Peek M. Kirchhofer D. Dennis M.S. Lazarus R.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 387-393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, these bifunctional fusion peptides were relatively large and required 2 disulfide bonds. Here we have pursued a new strategy to obtain less complex peptide exosite inhibitors that are both specific and complete. The crystal structure of the protease domain of FVII in complex with A-183 revealed that its C terminus was in close proximity to the active site (16Roberge M. Santell L. Dennis M.S. Eigenbrot C. Dwyer M.A. Lazarus R.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9522-9531Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 18Eigenbrot C. Kirchhofer D. Dennis M.S. Santell L. Lazarus R.A. Stamos J. Ultsch M.H. Structure. 2001; 9: 627-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This suggested that extending its C terminus into the active site region should result in a chimeric peptide having a high degree of specificity and potency due to its exosite interactions and more complete inhibition due to greater steric hindrance in the substrate binding cleft of the active site. Furthermore, such a chimeric peptide inhibitor could also have a higher affinity due to a more extensive binding surface.In order to determine both the preferred length and sequence for such an extension, we developed a novel strategy using substrate phage display. Substrate phage display has been successfully employed to determine preferred cleavage sequences for a variety of proteases (19Matthews D.J. Wells J.A.

The substrate phage library is displayed between the p3 coat protein of the phage and a protein or peptide affinity tag. Following addition of protease to the phage library, only phage containing preferred sequences are cleaved from the tag. Libraries immobilized prior to proteolysis release phage directly into the supernatant, whereas libraries in solution require capture of uncleaved phage after proteolysis. In either case, phage in the supernatant are propagated, and preferred substrate sequences are determined by sequencing of selected phage.In this report, we describe a new substrate phage approach in the context of the peptide exosite inhibitor A-183 and FVIIa, which serves as both the binding target and the protease. A-183 was used as the anchor to bring the substrate library in close proximity to the active site of FVIIa under conditions where the enzyme is not active (Fig. 1). Upon activation of FVIIa by addition of its obligate cofactor TF and modification of the pH, only phage with suitable sequences for enzymatic cleavage by TF·FVIIa are released and propagated. Employing this strategy, we panned 4 initial libraries and one consensus library to ultimately obtain a 27-residue peptide, which completely (∼99%) inhibited FX activation with enhanced affinity and improved the TF-dependent anticoagulant profile.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMolecular Modeling—A plausible and short route from the C terminus of A-183 to an Arg in the S1 subsite 2The numbering system used refers to positions in the linker libraries that start after the C-terminal Arg of A-183.

Academic Press, San Diego1999Google Scholar). This was carried out by first combining two halves of the protease domain, one from the A-183·FVII zymogen structure (16Roberge M. Santell L. Dennis M.S. Eigenbrot C. Dwyer M.A. Lazarus R.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9522-9531Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 18Eigenbrot C. Kirchhofer D. Dennis M.S. Santell L. Lazarus R.A. Stamos J. Ultsch M.H. Structure. 2001; 9: 627-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and the other from the TF·FVIIa structure (31Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chène C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). The rationale for this derives from the protease architecture (two distorted β-barrels) and the largely independent effects of A-183 in one barrel and the presentation of the S1 subsite in the other barrel. Despite the conceptual simplicity of this approach, the resulting hybrid structure is very likely to faithfully represent the salient features of the A-183·FVIIa structure.Substrate Phage Library Design—A His6-A183-(protease-resistant spacer)-p3 fusion was constructed for monovalent display of an A-183 extension peptide library on filamentous phage. The previously described clone AD (15Dennis M.S. Roberge M. Quan C. Lazarus R.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9513-9521Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) was used as a template for Kunkel mutagenesis (32Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4544) Google Scholar) to create a template phagemid containing DNA encoding His6, peptide A-183, 3 stop codons, and the protease-resistant sequence TPTDPPTTPPT (33Sidhu S.S. Kalmar G.B. Willis L.G. Borgford T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20167-20171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which was fused to the N terminus of g3. The following primers were used: 5′-TGC TGG ACG TGG GAG ACC TGC GAA CGT GGT GAA GGT CAG TAA TAA TAA ACC CCG ACC GAT CCG CCG ACC ACC CCG CCG ACC GAT TTT GAT TAT-3′ and 5′-ACA AAT GCC TAT GCA CAT CAC CAT CAC CAT CAC TCC GAA GAG TGG GAG-3′.Four random sequence peptide libraries were constructed based on the template phagemid above, which was used as the template: His6-A183-X1-X2-X3-X4-X5-X6-X7-a8-Asn9-Leu10-Thr11-Arg12-Ile13-Val14-Gly15-Gly16-(protease-resistant spacer)-p3, library A; His6-A183-X1-X2-X3-X4-X5-X6-X7-b8-Leu9-Thr10-Arg11-Ile12-Val13-Gly14-Gly15-(protease-resistant spacer)-p3, library B; His6-A183-X1-X2-X3-X4-X5-X6-X7-c8-Thr9-Arg10-Ile11-Val12-Gly13-Gly14-(protease-resistant spacer)-p3, library C; His6-A183-Gly1-Gly2-Ser3-Gly4-Gly5-Ser6-Gly7-X8-X9-X10-X11-X12-X13-X14-Gly15-Gly16-(protease-resistant spacer)-p3, library D. X refers to all 20 amino acids encoded by the 32 NNS codons (N stands for A, C, G, or T; S stands for G or C). Amino acid sets (S, N, K, R), (N, K), and (L, Q) are designated by a, b, and c, respectively, and are encoded by tailored codons (34Sidhu S.S. Lowman H.B. Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 333-363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides 5′-GAG ACC TGC GAA CGT NNS NNS NNS NNS NNS NNS NNS ARM AAC CTG ACC CGT ATC GTG GGT GGT ACC CCG ACC GAT CCG-3′, 5′-GAG ACC TGC GAA CGT NNS NNS NNS NNS NNS NNS NNS AAM CTG ACC CGT ATC GTG GGT GGT ACC CCG ACC GAT CCG-3′, 5′-GAG ACC TGC GAA CGT NNS NNS NNS NNS NNS NNS NNS CWG ACC CGT ATC GTG GGT GGT ACC CCG ACC GAT CCG-3′, and 5′-GAG ACC TGC GAA CGT GGT GGT AGC GGT GGT AGC GGT NNS NNS NNS NNS NNS NNS NNS GGT GGT ACC CCG ACC GAT CCG-3′ were used to generate libraries A, B, C, and D, respectively, which yielded 4.7 × 1010, 3.5 × 1010, 1.5 × 1010, and 1.7 × 1010Escherichia coli transformants, respectively. For these nucleotides, R stands for A or G, M stands for A or C, W stands for A or T, and N and S are described above.Peptide Library Selection—Individual wells of MaxiSorp plates were coated with 100 μl of FVIIa (10 μg/ml) or 100 μl of anti-His4 monoclonal antibody (mAb; 5 μg/ml) (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) in 50 mm carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, at 4 °C overnight. Wells were blocked for 1 h with casein in Tris-buffered saline or Superblock in Tris-buffered saline (Pierce) at room temperature before each round of panning. FVIIa-coated wells were incubated with peptide phage libraries in binding buffer (50 mm MES, pH 6.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% BSA, and 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h. Unbound phage were removed by repetitive washing in binding buffer. Individual wells were immediately treated with 100 μl of cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Tween 20, 1% BSA, 100 μg/ml TF-(1–219) (sTF)) and incubated for 5 min. The supernatant was removed and incubated with the anti-His4 mAb-coated wells. After 1 h, supernatant was removed, and phage were propagated in XL1-Blue cells with VCSM13 helper phage (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). After several rounds of panning, individual clones from each library were picked and sequenced. Enrichment was monitored by titering the number of phage released by FVIIa in cleavage buffer compared with phage released by FVIIa in binding buffer.Statistical Analysis of Sequence Data—The percent occurrence of each amino acid at each position was calculated after normalization for codon bias. The significance of the standard deviation was calculated essentially as described (35Lowman H.B. Wells J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 564-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar).Construction and Panning of a Partially Randomized Consensus Sequence—Based on the preferred residues found by panning libraries A and D, a consensus library was designed for monovalent display of His6-A183-Gly1-Glu2-X3-X4-X5-X6-Glu7-X8-X9-Glu10-Trp11-Arg12-Gly13-X14-X15-Gly16-Gly17-(protease-resistant spacer)-p3 random peptides. Codons GDG, GDC, GAS, GRG were used for positions X3, X4, X5, and X6, respectively, and codon NNS was used for positions X8, X9, X14, X15, respectively, where D stands for nucleotides A, G or T; N, S, and R nucleotides are defined above. This consensus library was sorted as described above, and individual clones were sequenced.Binding and Amidolytic Activity of Immobilized FVIIa—MaxiSorp plates were coated with 100 μl of FVIIa at different concentrations (1, 5, 10, and 20 μg/ml) in 50 mm carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, at 4 °C overnight. Amidolytic activity was monitored at 405 nm over 5 min with 0.5 mm Chromozym t-PA in 50 mm MES, pH 6.0, or 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, containing 5 mm CaCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% BSA in the absence and presence of a 10-fold molar excess of sTF over FVIIa in a total volume of 100 μl. Binding of N-terminal biotinylated A-183 to immobilized FVIIa was carried out at various pH values, ranging from pH 4 to 11 as described previously (16Roberge M. Santell L. Dennis M.S. Eigenbrot C. Dwyer M.A. Lazarus R.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9522-9531Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).TF·FVIIa Control Substrates—DNA encoding an 18-residue linker control sequence GGGSGGSNLTRIVGGSGG (CS) was inserted into pA-100-Z (15Dennis M.S. Roberge M. Quan C. Lazarus R.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9513-9521Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) between A-183 and the 58-residue Z-domain of staphylococcal protein A (36Nilsson B.

Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4544) Google Scholar). This A-183-CS-Z fusion peptide (EEWEVLCWTWETCERGGGSGGSNLTRIVGGSGGZ), which contains a FVIIa cleavage site (NLTRIVGG), was expressed and purified as described below for the Z-A-183 extension peptides. A-183-CS-Z (20 μg) was incubated in 50 mm MES, pH 6.0, or 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, each containing 5 mm CaCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20 for 2 h at room temperature at a 10:1:10 molar ratio of A-183-CS-Z/FVIIa/sTF. The reaction mixture was separated by reversed-phase HPLC using a water/acetonitrile gradient containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peaks were collected and analyzed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE, N-terminal sequencing, and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.A second substrate (A-183X-IVGGSGG-Z) was made as above using the 12-mer extension consensus sequence derived from substrate phage followed by the 7-residue sequence IVGGSGG. A-183X-IVGGSGG-Z (EEWEVLCWTWETCERGEGVEEELWEWRIVGGSGG-Z) was expressed and purified as described below for the Z-A-183 extension peptides. A-183X-IVGGSGG-Z (25 μg) was incubated in 50 mm MES, pH 6.0, or 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, and 5 mm CaCl2, each containing 150 mm NaCl for 20 h at room temperature at a 20:1:10 molar ratio of A-183X-IVGGSGGZ/FVIIa/sTF. The final reaction volume was 50 μl. The reaction mixture was analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and non-reducing SDS-PAGE using a 10–20% NOVEX gel.Z-A-183 Extension Peptides—DNA sequence encoding a linker (GGSGGDDDDK), A-183, and a stop codon were inserted into the vector pZCT (37Starovasnik M.A. O'Connell M.P. Fairbrother W.J. Kelley R.F. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1423-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) after the C terminus of the Z-domain using Kunkel mutagenesis (32Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4544) Google Scholar) to make an expression plasmid for Z-A-183 (pZCT-A-183), which was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The extension plasmids pZCT-A-183X, pZCT-A-183-[GGS]3GGR, pZCT-A-183-[GGS]4, pZCT-A-183X-R12A, and pZCT-A-183X-ΔR12 were constructed by Kunkel mutagenesis using pZCT-A183 as template by inserting DNA sequence encoding GEGVEEELWEWR, GGSGGSGGSGGR, GGSGGSGGSGGS, GEGVEEELWEWA, and GEGVEEELWEW, respectively, between the C terminus of A-183 and the stop codon. All constructs were transformed into E. coli strain 27C7 and grown in low phosphate minimal media (15Dennis M.S. Roberge M. Quan C. Lazarus R.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9513-9521Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). All Z-fusion peptides were secreted into the media and purified using IgG-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (38Dennis M.S. Carter P. Lazarus R.A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1993; 15: 312-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) followed by size exclusion on Superdex 75 (Amersham Biosciences) at 0.5 ml/min flow rate using Tris buffer, pH 7.5, and 200 mm NaCl. Fractions from gel filtration containing monomeric Z-fusion peptides were loaded on a 1-ml Resource Q column (Amersham Biosciences) for concentration and final purification by ion exchange chromatography, using a salt gradient from 0.2 to 0.8 m NaCl in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, over 12 column volumes at a flow rate of 3 ml/min.To obtain A-183X, we replaced the 10-residue linker above preceding the A-183X sequence with one having a FXa cleavage site (GGSGGIEGR) in pZCT-A-183X. A-183X was cleaved from Z-A-183X by overnight incubation at room temperature with bovine FXa in a 50:1 molar ratio (Z-A-183X/FXa). A-183X was then purified by size exclusion, using PBS containing 300 mm NaCl at 0.5 ml/min on a peptide Superdex column (Amersham Biosciences). Peaks were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and reversed phase HPLC, which resulted in a single peak.Inhibition of TF·FVIIa Activity—Inhibition of FX activation by TF·VIIa was determined in triplicate with 800 pm relipidated TF-(1–243), 8 pm FVIIa, and 330 nm FX at 25 °C as a function of peptide concentration essentially as described (14Dennis M.S.

TF was incorporated into phospholipid vesicles and quantified as described previously (39Kelley R.F. Refino C.J. O'Connell M.P. Modi N. Sehl P. Lowe D. Pater C. Bunting S. Blood. 1997; 89: 3219-3227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The linear rates of FXa generation (mA405·min–1·min–1) were converted to percent activities (100% × vi/v0). Control experiments showed that the peptides tested did not inhibit the FXa amidolytic activity.Inhibition of amidolytic activity to measure the IC50 value and extent of inhibition was carried out in triplicate at pH 7.8 essentially as described previously except that 30 nm sTF and 1 mm Chromozym t-PA were used (14Dennis M.S.

The linear rates of the increase in absorbance at 405 nm are expressed as percent activities (100% × vi/v0).Clotting Assays—The PT assay was performed in citrated and pooled normal human plasma as described previously (14Dennis M.S. Eigenbrot C. Skelton N.J. Ultsch M.H. Santell L. Dwyer M.A. O'Connell M.P. Lazarus R.A. Nature. 2000; 404: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Clotting times were determined in triplicate using an ACL 6000 Coagulation Analyzer (Coulter Corp., Miami, FL) using Innovin (human relipidated TF and Ca2+) from Dade Behring Inc. (Newark, DE) to initiate the assay.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONStructure-based Design and Substrate Phage Strategy—The crystal structure of A-183 in complex with the protease domain of FVII revealed the location of its binding site as well as the orientation of its N and C termini (16Roberge M.

https://openalex.org/W2024473097,"Transcription factor NF-κB plays a pivotal regulatory role in the genetic programs for cell cycle progression and inflammation. Nuclear translocation of NF-κB is controlled by an inducible protein kinase called IKK, which earmarks cytoplasmic inhibitors of NF-κB for proteolytic destruction. IKK contains two structurally related catalytic subunits termed IKKα and IKKβ as well as a noncatalytic subunit called IKKγ/NEMO. Mutations in the X-linked gene encoding IKKγ can interfere with NF-κB signaling and lead to immunodeficiency disease. Although its precise mechanism of action remains unknown, IKKγ is phosphorylated in concert with the induction of NF-κB by the viral oncoprotein Tax and the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor α (TNF). We now demonstrate that TNF-induced phosphorylation of IKKγ is blocked in cells deficient for IKKβ but not IKKα. Phosphopeptide-mapping experiments with metabolically radiolabeled cells indicate that IKKβ phosphorylates human IKKγ at Ser-31, Ser-43, and Ser-376 following the enforced expression of either the Tax oncoprotein or the type 1 TNF receptor. Inducible phosphorylation of IKKγ is attenuated following the deletion of its COOH-terminal zinc finger domain (amino acids 397–419), a frequent target for mutations that occur in IKKγ-associated immunodeficiencies. As such, IKKβ-mediated phosphorylation of IKKγ at these specific serine targets may facilitate proper regulation of NF-κB signaling in the immune system.

Each of these signal-dependent responses is controlled by labile cytoplasmic inhibitors of NF-κB such as IκBα and a multicomponent IκB kinase called IKK (8Zandi E. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The core IKK holoenzyme contains two catalytic subunits termed IKKα and IKKβ. Following cellular stimulation, the IKKβ catalytic subunit phosphorylates IκBα, leading to degradation of the inhibitor and nuclear translocation of NF-κB. Signal-dependent activation of IKKβ is triggered by phosphorylation of two serine residues in its “T loop” regulatory domain (9Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). This modification appears to involve either autophosphorylation or phosphoryl group transfer from an upstream IKKβ kinase to the same acceptor sites following cellular stimulation (9Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). More recent studies of the IκB kinase complex have identified a noncatalytic component called IKKγ (also known as NEMO, IKKAP1, or FIP-3) (10Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R.

Med. 2001; 7: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In terms of structural organization, sequences within the NH2-terminal half of IKKγ mediate its interaction with IKKβ (11Mercurio F. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Young D.B. Li J.W. Pascual G. Motiwala A. Zhu H. Mann M. Manning A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1526-1538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the COOH-terminal half of IKKγ is required for signal-dependent regulation of IκB kinase activity, suggesting that IKKγ links IKKβ to upstream activators (11Mercurio F. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Young D.B. Li J.W. Pascual G. Motiwala A. Zhu H. Mann M. Manning A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1526-1538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Natoli G.

Considering the key role that phosphorylation plays in the mechanism for IKKβ activation, these findings suggest that IKKγ subunit phosphorylation is important for proper regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. To extend these fundamental observations, we conducted new experiments that address the mechanism of IKKγ phosphorylation and the relevant phosphoacceptor sites. In this report, we demonstrate that endogenous IKKβ but not IKKα is required for signal-dependent phosphorylation of IKKγ in vivo. Using a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and phosphopeptide mapping, we have also monitored changes in the phosphorylation status of IKKγ in metabolically radiolabeled cells. Results from these biochemical experiments indicate that human IKKγ is phosphorylated at Ser-31, Ser-43, and Ser-376 in response to cellular stimulation with either TNF or the HTLV1 Tax oncoprotein. Minimal deletion of the zinc finger domain of IKKγ attenuates this inducible response. We conclude that IKKβ mediates phosphorylation of IKKγ at both amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal sites via a zinc finger-dependent mechanism. The observed in vivo pattern of signal-dependent phosphorylation at distal sites in the protein may reflect post-translational control of IKKγ at two distinct levels.

Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate method (27Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). At 36 h post-transfection, 293T cells were labeled for 4 h with [32P]orthophosphate (1 mCi/ml, ICN) in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech). Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from recipient cells by detergent lysis (28Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W.

Extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG M2 antibodies coupled to agarose in ELB buffer (250 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) (5Chu Z.L. DiDonato J.A.

MEFs were incubated overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum and then labeled in phosphate-free medium for 4 h with [32P]orthophosphate (1 mCi/ml) prior to agonist treatment. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as described above, precleared with polyclonal anti-HA antibodies bound to protein A, and immunoprecipitated with polyclonal anti-IKKγ antibodies. Resultant complexes were washed sequentially with ELB buffer containing 2 m urea and then with 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate pH 7.2, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40. Immunoprecipitates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride (PVDF) membranes. Phosphoproteins were identified by autoradiography and analyzed by immunoblotting using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Pierce) (5Chu Z.L. DiDonato J.A. Hawiger J. Ballard D.W. J. Biol.

Resolved phosphoproteins were quantitatively analyzed with a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Phosphopeptide Mapping and Phosphoamino Acid Analysis—Phosphoproteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes, and visualized by autoradiography. Membrane sections containing radiolabeled IKKγ were excised, incubated with methanol, and then blocked with 50 mm NH4HCO3 containing 0.1% Tween 20 (Bio-Rad) for 30 min at room temperature. Phosphoproteins were digested in situ with N-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK) treated chymotrypsin (8 μg, Worthington) in 125 μl of NH4HCO3 (37 oC, 12 h) (29Luo K.X. Hurley T.R. Sefton B.M.

(30Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar) excluding the performic acid oxidation. Phosphoproteins were first separated by electrophoresis on TLC plates at pH 1.9 (30Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar) using the Hunter thin-layer electrophoresis system (model HTLE-7000, CBS Scientific). Separation in the second dimension was performed by ascending chromatography in n-butanol (37.5%), pyridine (25%), and acetic acid (7.5%) (30Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). Resolved phosphopeptides were visualized by autoradiography using Biomax MS high speed film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Phosphoaminoacid analysis was performed by hydrolysis of membrane-bound IKKγ with 6 n HCl as described previously (30Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). IκB Kinase Assays—Cytoplasmic extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-T7 antibodies in the presence of ELB buffer. IκB kinase activity was measured as described previously (5Chu Z.L. DiDonato J.A. Hawiger J. Ballard D.W. J. Biol.

Radiolabeled products were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes, and visualized by autoradiography. IKKβ Is Required for in Vivo Phosphorylation of IKKγ—Two interactive components of IKK termed IKKβ and IKKγ are essential for TNF-induced phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα (7Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). Phosphoryl group transfer to IκBα is mediated by IKKβ, which is itself activated via a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism (9Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). However, the functional requirement for IKKγ in this context remains an enigma (16Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: 81-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3286) Google Scholar). In this regard, we recently found that IKKγ also serves as a phosphorylation substrate in cells expressing the Tax oncoprotein of HTLV1, a potent pathologic inducer of IκB kinase activity (19Carter R.S. Geyer B.C. Xie M. Acevedo-Suarez C.A. Ballard D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24445-24448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Accordingly, signal-dependent phosphorylation of IKKγ may regulate the function of this noncatalytic subunit in the NF-κB signaling pathway. To extend our findings with Tax, we monitored IKKγ subunit phosphorylation in MEFs following treatment with proinflammatory mediators. In initial experiments, wild type MEFs were metabolically radiolabeled with [32P]orthophosphate and then stimulated with either TNF, IL-1, or LPS. Endogenous IKKγ complexes were purified by immunoprecipitation, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by sequential autoradiography and immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 1A (top panel), TNF induced significant phosphorylation of IKKγ as compared with untreated controls (top panel, lanes 1 and 2). Similar results were obtained with IL-1 and LPS (lanes 3 and 4). Changes in the phosphorylation status of IKKγ could not be attributed to differences in either IKKβ or IKKγ protein content (lower panels). As expected, IKKβ was also phosphorylated and activated under these stimulatory conditions (top panel and data not shown). We conclude that phosphorylation of endogenous IKKγ is induced not only by Tax but also by multiple proinflammatory agonists of NF-κB in murine fibroblasts. In prior studies, we found that IKKβ has the capacity to phosphorylate a recombinant IKKγ substrate in vitro (19Carter R.S. Geyer B.C. Xie M. Acevedo-Suarez C.A. Ballard D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24445-24448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This finding raised the possibility that in vivo phosphorylation of IKKγ is mediated by IKKβ or the structurally related IKKα catalytic subunit. To test this hypothesis, MEFs deficient for either IKKα or IKKβ were cultured in the presence of [32P]orthophosphate and stimulated with TNF under conditions leading to optimal IκB kinase activity (data not shown). We then prepared IKK immunocomplexes and monitored the core subunits for phosphoprotein content. As shown in Fig. 1B (top panel), treatment of wild type MEFs with TNF led to a 13.6-fold increase in IKKγ phosphorylation (lanes 1 and 2). This inducible response was readily detected in MEFs lacking IKKα (lanes 3 and 4), whereas IKKγ phosphorylation was almost completely blocked in MEFs lacking IKKβ (lanes 5 and 6). Coupled with our prior in vitro results (19Carter R.S. Geyer B.C. Xie M. Acevedo-Suarez C.A. Ballard D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24445-24448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we conclude that IKKβ mediates phosphorylation of IKKγ under physiologic signaling conditions. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that IKKα plays a secondary role in IKKγ phosphorylation. IKKγ Is Phosphorylated on Multiple Serines—A prerequisite for understanding the functional consequences of IKKγ subunit phosphorylation is to identify the relevant IKKβ-responsive acceptor sites. To address this important question, expression vectors for IKKβ, IKKγ, and HTLV1 Tax were transfected into 293T cells. After metabolic radiolabeling with 32Pi, ectopic IKKγ complexes were immunopurified and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 2A, phosphoryl group transfer to IKKγ was significantly increased in the presence of Tax relative to the basal level of IKKγ phosphorylation in Tax-deficient cells. Importantly, IKKβ was chronically phosphorylated and activated by Tax under these experimental conditions, permitting us to capture sufficient quantities of stably modified IKKγ for subsequent phosphoamino acid and phosphopeptide-mapping analyses. As shown in Fig. 2B, these biochemical studies revealed the presence of phosphoserine in IKKγ but no evidence for signal-dependent phosphorylation of either threonine or tyrosine residues. Based on the corresponding cDNA sequences, human IKKγ contains a total of 26 serine residues, 19 of which are conserved in murine IKKγ (10Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R.

A. 1999; 96: 1042-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Accordingly, IKKγ may contain more than one inducible phosphoacceptor site. To address this possibility, human 293T cells were programmed with expression vectors for IKKγ and IKKβ in the presence or absence of a Tax effector plasmid. Radiolabeled IKKγ was purified from recipient cells and digested with chymotrypsin, and the resultant peptides were resolved by two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping (30Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2C, IKKγ derived from Tax-expressing cells contained four major chymotryptic phosphopeptides, which we designated as PP-1, PP-2, PP-3, and PP-4. Radiolabeling efficiencies for the same set of IKKγ phosphopeptides were significantly reduced in parallel studies with Tax-deficient cells, thus confirming the signal-dependent nature of these post-translational modifications (Fig. 2C). Considering that there are 14 potential sites for chymotryptic cleavage in IKKγ, our biochemical mapping data strongly suggest that Tax induces phosphorylation of IKKγ at multiple serine residues in vivo. Identification of Inducible Phosphoacceptors in IKKγ—To assign specific phosphoacceptors in IKKγ, we next used site-directed mutagenesis to replace individual serine residues with alanine in the full-length protein. In this regard, sequences in the NH2-terminal region of IKKγ (amino acids 1–120) are necessary for its interaction with the IKKβ catalytic subunit (11Mercurio F. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A.

Pober J.S. Ghosh S. Science. 2000; 289: 1550-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). To determine whether the IKKβ binding domain of IKKγ is subject to signal-dependent phosphorylation, 293T cells were programmed with expression vectors for Tax, IKKβ, and human IKKγ containing alanine replacements at serine residues 17, 31, 43, 68, and 85. All five of these serines are conserved between mouse and human IKKγ (10Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A.

A. 1999; 96: 1042-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). After labeling recipient cells with 32Pi, IKKγ proteins were isolated, digested with chymotrypsin, and analyzed by two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping. As shown in Fig. 3 (upper panels), point mutations at Ser-31 and Ser-43 in IKKγ eliminated two of the four major phosphopeptides identified in control-mapping experiments with wild type IKKγ (PP-1 and PP-2, respectively). In sharp contrast, replacement of either Ser-17, Ser-68, or Ser-85 with alanine yielded a phosphopeptide fingerprint that was indistinguishable from the pattern for wild type IKKγ following chymotrypsin digestion (Fig. 3, lower panels). These in vivo results indicate that IKKβ mediates inducible phosphorylation of IKKγ at Ser-31 and Ser-43, whereas other local serine residues in the IKKβ binding domain of IKKγ are spared from modification. In contrast to the NH2-terminal region of IKKγ, sequences in the COOH-terminal half of the protein (amino acids 320–419) appear to couple IKK to upstream signal (11Mercurio F. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Young D.B. Li J.W. Pascual G. Motiwala A. Zhu H. Mann M. Manning A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1526-1538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Natoli G. Karin M. Nature. 1998; 395: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). In the case of human IKKγ, this region contains potential serine phosphoacceptors at positions 341, 346, 350, 364, 376, 377, 383, and 387. Based on their corresponding phosphopeptide fingerprints, mutations affecting the first four members of this set did not significantly change the phosphorylation status of IKKγ in Tax-expressing cells (data not shown). Accordingly, we engineered alanine replacements into IKKγ at the cluster of serines positioned between amino acids 370 and 390 (denoted as S376A, S377A, S383A, and S387A). As shown in Fig. 4 (top panels), point mutations at either Ser-383 or Ser-387 had no significant effect on distribution of the four major phosphopeptides identified in studies with wild type IKKγ. However, in vivo phosphorylation of S376A in Tax-expressing cells yielded a pattern of chymotryptic peptides that was clearly distinct from the wild type IKKγ fingerprint, specifically with respect to PP-3 and PP-4 (Fig. 4, bottom panels). Of particular interest, the mutation of Ser-376 was associated with the appearance of two new phosphopeptides (designated PP-3′ and PP-4′), suggesting the presence of compensatory phosphoacceptors in the same chymotryptic fragments. Consistent with this hypothesis, alanine replacement of Ser-377 in mutant S376A eliminated the appearance of PP-3′ and PP-4′ (mutant S376/377A), whereas the disruption of Ser-377 alone was without affect (mutant S377A). These data indicate that Ser-376 is the primary target for phosphorylation in the COOH-terminal region of IKKγ and the vicinal serine at position 377 serves a compensatory role. Taken together with data shown in Fig. 3, our mapping experiments strongly suggest that Ser-31, Ser-43, and Ser-376 are the major phosphoacceptor sites in human IKKγ. To confirm this interpretation, we next engineered expression vectors for IKKγ containing serial mutations at the identified serine phosphoacceptors and introduced them into 293T cell transfectants along with Tax and IKKβ effector plasmids. IKKβ immunocomplexes were then isolated from 32Pi-labeled recipients and analyzed for phosphoprotein content. As shown in Fig. 5, simultaneous disruption of Ser-31 and Ser-43 in the NH2-terminal region of IKKγ led to a significant reduction in subunit-specific phosphorylation (mutant S31/43A, lane 3). Simultaneous disruption of Ser-376 and compensatory Ser-377 in the COOH-terminal half of IKKγ also attenuated 32Pi incorporation into the protein (mutant S376/377A, lane 4). Consistent with the biochemical phenotype of these double point mutants, the defect in substrate-radiolabeling efficiency was further evident (∼19% wild type control) when all four of the identified serine targets in IKKγ were disrupted in combination by site-directed mutagenesis (lane 5). Observed changes in the phosphorylation status of IKKγ were not attributed to fluctuations in ectopic protein expression, because each of the phosphorylation-defective mutants of IKKγ were comparably expressed in metabolically radiolabeled cells (Fig. 5, bottom panels). Moreover, these results could not be attributed to changes in the overall structural integrity"
https://openalex.org/W2076483928,"In mating mixtures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, cells polarize their growth toward their conjugation partners along a pheromone gradient. This chemotropic phenomenon is mediated by structural proteins such as Far1 and Bem1 and by signaling proteins such as Cdc24, Cdc42, and Gβγ. The Gβγ subunit is thought to provide a positional cue that recruits the polarity establishment proteins, and thereby induces polarization of the actin cytoskeleton. We identified RHO1 in a screen for allelespecific high-copy suppressors of Gβγ overexpression, suggesting that Rho1 binds Gβγ in vivo. Inactivation of Rho1 GTPase activity augmented the rescue phenotype, suggesting that it is the activated form of Rho1 that binds Gβγ. We also found, in a pull-down assay, that Rho1 associates with GST-Ste4 and that Rho1 is localized to the neck and tip of mating projections. Moreover, a mutation in STE4 that disrupts Gβγ-Rho1 interaction reduces the projection tip localization of Rho1 and compromises the integrity of pheromone-treated cells deficient in Rho1 activity. In addition to its roles as a positive regulator of 1,3-β-glucan synthase and of the cell integrity MAP kinase cascade, it was recently shown that Rho1 is necessary for the formation of mating projections.

Signal-induced polarized growth is a fundamental mechanism of cellular differentiation and environmental response. The function of many mammalian cell types depends on their ability to sense relevant stimuli and grow in a directed fashion. An excellent model system with which to study such chemotropic phenomena is the mating response of the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In preparation to mate, haploid yeast of opposite mating types exchange peptide mating pheromones. The binding of pheromone to G protein-coupled receptors triggers a developmental program that ultimately blocks cell cycle progression, alters gene expression, and induces the formation of elongated projections called shmoos. These mating projections grow toward the highest concentration of pheromone and are crucial for the establishment of cell fusion (1Segall J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In S. cerevisiae, the plasma membrane is supported by a rigid cell wall composed of polysaccharides and mannoproteins (9Klis F.M. Yeast. 1994; 10: 851-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Presumably, growth of the plasma membrane requires growth of the cell wall. The biosynthesis of cell wall components is tightly coordinated with the construction of new cell wall (9Klis F.M. Yeast. 1994; 10: 851-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). This coordination is partially dependent on Rho1, a monomeric G protein belonging to the same GTPase subfamily as Cdc42. Rho1 plays a dual role in cell wall biosynthesis. First, Rho1 is a regulatory subunit of the glucan synthase enzymatic complex (10Drgonova J. Drgon T. Tanaka K. Kollar R. Chen G.-C. Ford R.A.

Here we show that in addition to stimulating polarized growth of the plasma membrane by recruiting Cdc42, Gβγ also associates with Rho1. This association is required for proper localization of Rho1 to the tip of the mating projection. Molecular and Microbiological Techniques—Standard methods were used for microbial and molecular manipulation (15Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology.

All other yeast strains used in this study were derived from strain 15Dau (MATabar1Δ ade1 his2 leu2–3,-112 trp1 ura3Δ), which is isogenic with strain BF264 –15D (17Reed S.I. Hadwiger J.A. Lorincz A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4055-4059Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Both strains A35 and ELY115 contain the STE4A405V allele at the STE4 locus. Strain A35 is the original mutant STE4 isolate (18Li E. Meldrum E. Stratton H. Stone D.E. Genetics. 1998; 148: 947-961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was back-crossed three times prior to use in this study. Strain ELY115 was created by replacing STE4 with STE4A405V in the wild type 15Dau background (18Li E. Meldrum E. Stratton H. Stone D.E. Genetics. 1998; 148: 947-961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast transformations were preformed by the lithium acetate method (19Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Escherichia coli transformations were preformed by electroporation (16Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Janssen K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar). The plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I. Plasmids YCplac33/GAL1-STE4 and YCplac33/GAL1-STE4A405V were constructed as follows: STE4 was PCR-amplified from YCplac33/STE4 and YCplac33/STE4A405V (18Li E. Meldrum E. Stratton H. Stone D.E.

PYES2.0/GAL1-RHO1 was created as follows: RHO1 was PCR-amplified using strain 15Dau genomic DNA as template, and the product was cloned into the pYES2.0 vector (Invitrogen) as a BamHI-EcoRI fragment. The priming oligonucleotides were: 5′-CGGGTACCTGCACTAATAGAAAATCATAGAAC-3′ and 5′-GGGAATTC AAAGGCATACGTACATACAATAGA-3′. pEB15.0 was created as follows: RHO1 was PCR-amplified from strain 15Dau genomic DNA, and the product was cloned into pESC-URA (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as a KpnI-XhoI fragment, thereby placing RHO1 under GAL1 promoter control. The priming oligonucleotides were: 5′-CCGCTCGAGATGTCACAACAAG TTGGTAAC-3′ and 5′-CGGGGTACCCTATAACAAGACACATTTC-3′. FAR1 was PCR-amplified from strain 15Dau genomic DNA, and the product was cloned into pESC-URA as a PacI-BglII fragment, thereby placing FAR1 under GAL10 promoter control. The priming oligonucleotides were: 5′-CCTTAATTAAGCGTAGTATAGACGTGGAG-3′ and 5′-GAAGATCTTGAAGACACCAACAAGAGTTTCG-3′. pEB13.0 was created as follows: STE4 was PCR-amplified from 15Dau genomic DNA, and the product was cloned into pYEX4T-1 (Clontech Lab. Palo Alto, CA) as an EcoRI fragment. The priming oligonucleotides were: 5′-CGGAATTCATGGCAGCACATCAGATGG-3′ and 5′-GAATTCCACAGTATTTCCAATTCG-3′. The resulting CUP1-GST-STE4 hybrid gene was then excised as a PvuII-NdeI fragment. Its ends were blunted using Klenow fragments and subcloned into PvuII-digested YCplac111. pEB13.2 was created by subcloning the blunt-ended PvuII-NdeI CUP1-GST fragment from pYEX4T-1 to YCplac111. pEB13.1 was created by converting the wild type STE4 allele of pEB13.0 to STE4A405V using the QuikChange™ mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutagenic primers were: 5′-GTCCAGATGGGTTAGTTGTATGTACAGGTTCA-3′ and 5′-CCTGTACATACAACTAACCCATCTGGACTCG-3′ (the mutagenic bases are indicated in boldface and underlined). pEB13.5 was created as follows: PKC1378–640 (PKC1RID) was PCR-amplified from pGAD424/ PKC1. The priming oligonucleotides were: 5′-GCGAAGATCTACACTAGGATTCCACAAGTC-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGCGGGGCCTCATTTTCATCGA-3′. The PCR product was digested with BglII and XhoI and subcloned into BamHI/XhoI-digested pEB13.2. pEB18.0 was created as follows: PKC1RID was PCR-amplified from pGAD424/PKC1. The priming oligonucleotides were: 5′-TCCCCGCGGGGAATGACACTAGGATTCCACAAGTC-3′ and 5′-TCCCCGCGGGGACTCATTTTCATCGATAAATTTATTTAG-3′. The PCR product was digested with SacII and ligated to SacII-digested pRS316CG. YCplac22/GAL1-His6-STE18 was created as follows: STE18 was PCR-amplified from 15Dau genomic DNA. The priming oligonucleotides were: 5′-GGATCCATGCATCACCATCACCATCACATGACATCAGTTCAAAACTC TCCACGC-3′ and 5′-GAAGCTTTTACATAAGCGTACAACAAACAC-3′. The PCR product was ligated into PCRII (Invitrogen), and subsequently subcloned into YCplac22/GAL1 as a BamHI-HindIII fragment.

Transformants were spread on selective sucrose medium lacking uracil and tryptophan. Approximately 100,000 colonies were then replica-plated to selective dextrose or to selective galactose medium lacking uracil and tryptophan. Rescue of growth arrest was verified, and sterile mutants were discarded. The YCpLac33/GAL1-STE4 plasmid was cured using 5-fluoroorotic acid, and the strains were transformed with YCplac33/GAL1-STE4A405V. The ability of the library clone to rescue overexpression of STE4A405V was then determined. Library clones that showed allele specificity were characterized further. Colony Formation Assays—Colony formation assays were performed by spreading 750 cells on the appropriate selective medium containing a range of α-factor concentrations. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 3–5 days. Resistance to α-factor was quantified by determining the percent survival on medium containing 3, 6, 15, 30, and 60 nm α-factor as compared with the number of colonies that formed on medium lacking pheromone. FUS1 Expression Assays—Expression of the pheromone-inducible FUS1 transcript was assayed by measuring β-galactosidase levels in cells containing a FUS1-lacZ reporter gene. Strain 15Dau was transformed with the FUS1-LacZ reporter vector (pSB231) (21Trueheart J. Boeke J.D. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2316-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) and either pYES2 or pYES2/GAL1-RHO1. Cultures were grown at 30 °Ctoan A600 of 0.5 in selective galactose medium. α-Factor was added to a final concentration of 15 nm, and the cultures were shaken at 30 °C. Cells were harvested, and β-galactosidase activity was determined as described previously (22Slater M.R. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1906-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To assay β-galactosidase in cells grown on solid medium, nitrocellulose lift assays were performed as described (23Breeden L. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1987; 48: 389-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Immunoblots—Yeast whole cell extracts were prepared by bead beating and clarified by centrifugation. 15 μg of total protein/well was electrophoresed on discontinuous SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electro-blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PVDF-PLUS, MSI Inc., Westborough, MA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Blots were then blocked with 5% nonfat dry-milk in TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl) for 1 h and incubated with a 1:2000 dilution of a rabbit anti-GST antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or a 1:500 dilution of the 9E10 mouse anti c-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz). Membranes were incubated at 4 °C overnight and then washed three times with TBS plus 0.2% Tween for 10 min. The washed membranes were probed with either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Promega, Madison, WI) or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were washed three times with TBS plus 2% Tween, and peroxidase activity was visualized using ECL (Amersham Biosciences) and Fuji RX film (Fuji Medical Systems, Stanford, CT). GST Pull-down—Yeast strains EBY185, EBY186, and EBY187 were derived from strain 15Dau by transformation. They each carry the YCplac22/GAL1-His6-STE18 and pEB15.0 plasmids. In addition, EBY185 carries the pEB13.0 plasmid, EBY186 carries the pEB13.1 plasmid, and EBY187 carries the pEB13.2 plasmid. All three strains were grown in selective medium at 30 °C to an A600 of 0.4, at which point galactose was added to a final concentration of 3%. Cultures were then split and incubated for 2 h at 30 °C. α-Factor was added to a final concentration of 15 nm, and the cultures were incubated for an additional 4 h. Cells were visualized by phase-contrast light microscopy to confirm mating projection formation in the treated cultures. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once with cold water, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Upon thawing, cell pellets were washed once with TBS and lysed with glass beads in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm NaPPi, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF). Protease inhibitors were added just before lysis: 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Roche Applied Science), 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin (Sigma). The crude lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. For each sample, 1 mg of total protein was transferred to a chilled microcentrifuge tube containing 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences); the tubes were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and then for an additional 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed several times with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with the protease inhibitor mixture described above. To elute the bound proteins, 50 μl of sample loading buffer was added, and the samples were boiled for 3 min. Samples were subjected to SDS electrophoresis. Immunofluorescence—Strains 15Dau, A35, and ELY115 were transformed with pHA-RHO1 and grown to mid-log phase in selective medium at 30 °C. The localization of HA-Rho1 was determined by immunofluorescence before and 2 h after treatment with 30 nm α-factor. Cells were prepared for immunofluorescent microscopy as described previously (15Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1991Google Scholar). The primary antibody, 12CA5 (Roche Diagnostics), was incubated with the immobilized cells at a dilution of 1:500, and the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Santa Cruz) was diluted 1:2000. Fluorescent images were acquired using a Zeiss Axioskop 2 microscope fitted with a Zeiss AxioCam digital camera and processed using Zeiss AxioVision software. PKC1RID-GFP Visualization—Strains 15Dau, A35, and ELY115 were transformed with pEB18.0 and grown to mid-log phase in selective medium at 30 °C. The expression of PKC1RID-GFP was induced by adding CuSO4 to a concentration of 0.5 mm. The localization of Pkc1RID-GFP was visualized before and 2 h after treatment with 30 nm α-factor. Live cells were scored for the presence of Pkc1RID-GFP at the mating projection tip using a Zeiss Axioskop 2 microscope. Photomicrographs and Quantification of HA-Rho1 Localization— Fluorescent images were acquired using a Zeiss Axioskop 2 microscope fitted with a Zeiss AxioCam digital camera and processed using Zeiss AxioVision software. Localization of HA-Rho1 was quantified from the digital images using the histogram function of Adobe Photoshop, version 5.5. A circle of set size was used to sample the brightness of the projection tip and a peripheral point directly opposite the tip of cells from randomly chosen fields. The ratio of tip to bottom fluorescence was rounded to the nearest 0.1, and values corresponding to 50 cells for each strain were plotted in histograms. Cell Lysis Assay—Cells were grown at 23 °C in selective media to a density of A600 = 2.5, and then 4 ml of each culture was harvested and resuspended in 1 ml of rich medium (YEPD medium, containing 1% yeast extract (Difco Laboratories), 2% Bacto-Peptone (Difco), and 2% glucose). After incubation at 23 °C for 4 h, the cells were pelleted again and resuspended in 40 μl of YEPD. 10 μl of each suspension was spotted onto YEPD plates and on YEPD plates supplemented with 150 nm α-factor. After incubation at room temperature overnight, the lysis assay was performed as described previously (24Paravicini G. Cooper M. Friedli L. Smith D.J. Carpentier J.L. Klig L.S. Payton M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4896-4905Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Digital images of the plates were acquired after 2 h at room temperature. Rho1 Associates with Ste4 —On the basis of genetic and structural evidence, we have inferred that an unknown protein binds and down-regulates the βγ subunit of the pheromone responsive G protein. Gβ and Gγ are encoded by the STE4 and STE18 loci, respectively. A tight cluster of mutations in STE4 (A405V, G409D, S410L, and W411L/S) disrupts interaction with the putative regulator (18Li E. Meldrum E. Stratton H. Stone D.E. Genetics. 1998; 148: 947-961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To identify the unknown element, we took advantage of the observation that Gβγ overexpression strongly induces the mating signal and thereby confers permanent cell cycle arrest (25Cole G.M. Stone D.E. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 510-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 26Nomoto S. Nakayama N. Arai K.-I. Matsumoto K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 27Whiteway M. Hougan I. Thomas D.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Plasmids were constructed that allow for the galactose-inducible expression of Gβ (GAL1-STE4) and Gγ (GAL1-STE18). A high-copy GAL1-cDNA yeast library was then screened for plasmids that could rescue the overexpression of wild type Gβγ. Plasmids recovered in this step were re-screened for the inability to rescue the overexpression of a mutant form of Gβγ, encoded by STE4A405V and STE18. We reasoned that genes identified in this allele-specific screen might encode proteins that interact with Ste4. Of the 250,000 transformants screened, the most frequently isolated plasmid contained RHO1. Rho1 is a highly conserved and well studied monomeric G protein. The mammalian homologue of Rho1, RhoA, is involved in polarization of the actin cytoskeleton. It has also been implicated in transcription, adhesion, and transformation (28Narumiya S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 29Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K.

Like mammalian Rho proteins, Rho1 is thought to play a role in polarization of the actin cytoskeleton (10Drgonova J. Drgon T. Tanaka K. Kollar R. Chen G.-C. Ford R.A. Chan C.S.M. Takai Y. Cabib E.

However, it also stimulates 1,3-β-glucan synthase (10Drgonova J. Drgon T. Tanaka K. Kollar R. Chen G.-C. Ford R.A. Chan C.S.M. Takai Y. Cabib E.

Chem. 1996; 271: 9193-9196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 34Levin D.E. Fields F.O. Kunisawa R. Bishop J.M. Thorner J. Cell. 1990; 62: 213-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), both of which are necessary for growth of the yeast cell wall. To confirm and quantitate the effect of Rho1 overexpression on Gβγ-induced lethality, we performed single-colony formation assays. Strain 15Da (17Reed S.I. Hadwiger J.A. Lorincz A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4055-4059Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) was co-transformed with either the wild type or mutant Gβγ-overexpressing plasmids and either RHO1 low-copy, RHO1 high-copy, or control plasmids. Transformants were plated on glucose and on galactose medium, respectively, to repress and induce expression of Gβγ. Only about 0.5% of the cells overexpressing wild type Gβγ in the absence of excess Rho1 were able to form colonies (Fig. 1A). In contrast, about 5% of the cells transformed with the low-copy number RHO1 plasmid and about 13% of the cells transformed with the high-copy number RHO1 plasmid could overcome the excess Gβγ and form colonies. Interestingly, overexpression of a mutationally activated form of Rho1, RHO1Q68H, enhanced the rescue phenotype by about 3-fold. However, neither Rho1 nor Rho1Q68H could significantly increase the plating efficiency of cells forced to overexpress the mutant form of Gβγ. The simplest interpretation of these data is that excess Rho1 antagonizes Gβγ-induced cell cycle arrest by directly interacting with Ste4. A less likely possibility is that Rho1 rescues cells overexpressing Gβγ by promoting cell cycle progression rather than by relieving the inhibitory effects of the mating signal. To distinguish these hypotheses, we assessed the effect of Rho1 overexpression on mating specific transcription using a FUS1-lacZ reporter. The reporter was stimulated either by treating cells with pheromone or by expression of Ste11-4, a dominant mutant form of the Ste11 MEK kinase that constitutively activates the mating pathway (35Stevenson B.J. Rhodes N. Errede B. Sprague G.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1293-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Excess wild type Rho1 reduced pheromone-induction of FUS1-lacZ by about 50% (Fig. 1B) but had no effect on the activity of Ste11-4 (Fig. 1C). Thus, Rho1 overexpression inhibits the effects of free Gβγ on both transcription and cell cycle progression, and it does so at or above the level of the MEK kinase. To further evaluate the possibility that Gβγ physically interacts with Rho1, we constructed tagged versions of Ste4, Ste18, and Rho1, and performed pull-down assays. The tagged forms of all three proteins proved to be functional (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2, myc-Rho1 specifically associated with GSTSte4 but failed to associate with GST-Ste4A405V or GST alone. Interestingly, the Far1 protein, which links Gβγ with Bem1 and Cdc42, also failed to associate with GST-Ste4A405V (data not shown). The Localization of Rho1 to the Tips of Mating Projections Depends on Ste4 —In dividing cells, Rho1 associates with cortical actin patches, concentrating at the site of bud emergence, the tip of growing buds, and the mother-bud neck region prior to cytokinesis (31Drgonova J.

The GMp motif in the N-terminal region of the cytokeratin 14 of ameloblasts binds to trityrosyl motif peptide (ATMP) of amelogenin (Ravindranath, R. M. H., Tam, W., Bringas, P., Santos, V., and Fincham, A. G. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 36586 – 36597). K14 (Type I) pairs with K5 (Type II) in basal epithelial cells; GlcNAc-acylated K5 is identified in ameloblasts. Dosimetric analysis showed the binding affinity of amelogenin to K5 and to GlcNAc-acylated-positive control, ovalbumin. The specific binding of [3H]ATMP with K5 or ovalbumin was confirmed by Scatchard analysis. [3H]ATMP failed to bind to K5 after removal of GlcNAc. Blocking K5 with ATMP abrogates the K5-amelogenin interaction. K5 failed to bind to ATMP when the third proline was substituted with threonine, as in some cases of human X-linked amelogenesis imperfecta or when tyrosyl residues were substituted with phenylalanine. Confocal laser scan microscopic observations on ameloblasts during postnatal (PN) growth of the teeth showed that the K5-amelogenin complex migrated from the cytoplasm to the periphery (on PN day 1) and accumulated at the apical region on day 3. Secretion of amelogenin commences from day 1. K5, similar to K14, may play a role of chaperone during secretion of amelogenin. Upon secretion of amelogenin, K5 pairs with K14. Pairing of K5 and K14 commences on day 3 and ends on day 9. The pairing of K5 and K14 marks the end of secretion of amelogenin. The enamel protein amelogenin binds to GlcNAc (Ravindranath, R. M. H., Moradian-Oldak, R., and Fincham, A.G. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 2464–2471) and to the GlcNAc-mimicking peptide (GMp) (Ravindranath, R. M. H., Tam, W., Nguyen, P., and Fincham, A. G. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 39654–39661). The GMp motif in the N-terminal region of the cytokeratin 14 of ameloblasts binds to trityrosyl motif peptide (ATMP) of amelogenin (Ravindranath, R. M. H., Tam, W., Bringas, P., Santos, V., and Fincham, A. G. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 36586 – 36597). K14 (Type I) pairs with K5 (Type II) in basal epithelial cells; GlcNAc-acylated K5 is identified in ameloblasts. Dosimetric analysis showed the binding affinity of amelogenin to K5 and to GlcNAc-acylated-positive control, ovalbumin. The specific binding of [3H]ATMP with K5 or ovalbumin was confirmed by Scatchard analysis. [3H]ATMP failed to bind to K5 after removal of GlcNAc.

Ameloblasts synthesize and secrete the proteins involved in the microstructure and biomineralization of the enamel. Amelogenin constitutes 90% of the total enamel proteins secreted by ameloblasts. It is a non-glycosylated single polypeptide of about 180 amino acids (1Termine J.D. Belcourt A.B. Miyamoto M.S. Conn K.M. J. Biol.

The C-terminal 13-amino acid sequence in the TRAP region called “amelogenin tyrosyl motif peptide” (ATMP: PYPSYGYEPMGGW) possesses unique ligand-binding properties, in that it binds specifically to N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) (4Ravindranath R.M.H.

A GMp motif is found in the N-terminal region of Type I cytokeratin 14 (K14), a differentiation marker for ameloblasts prior to amelogenin synthesis (7Tabata M.J. Matsumura T. Liu J.G. Wakisaka S. Kurisu K. Arch. Oral Biol. 1996; 41: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The purified or recombinant amelogenin and TRAP bind to K14 in vitro dosimetrically (8Ravindranath R.M.H.

Scatchard analysis confirms the specific interaction between K14 and ATMP in vitro. GlcNAc and GMp blocked binding of rM179 or ATMP with K14. Mutated ATMP failed to bind to K14 when the third proline was substituted with threonine, as in some cases of human X-linked AI (6Collier P.M. Sauk J.J. Rosenbloom S.J. Yuan Z.A. Gibson C.W. Arch. Oral Biol. 1997; 42: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) or when tyrosyl residues were substituted with phenylalanine. Amelogenin co-assembled with K14 in the perinuclear region of ameloblasts on day 0. The K14-amelogenin complex migrated to the apical region of the ameloblasts on day 1 and accumulated there between days 3 and 5 and collapsed on day 9. Autoradiography with [3H]ATMP and [3H]GMp corroborated the dissociation of amelogenin and K14 at the Tomes' process of the ameloblast, suggesting that K14 plays a chaperone role for nascent amelogenin polypeptide during secretion of amelogenin (8Ravindranath R.M.H. Tam W. Bringas Jr., P. Santos V. Fincham A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36586-36597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). K14 (Type I) pairs with Type II K5 in basal epithelial cells. Such pairing of Type I and Type II cytokeratins are known to occur during epithelial cell differentiation (9Sun T.T. Eichner R. Schermer A. Cooper D. Nelson W.G. Weiss R.A. Levine A.J. VandeWoude G.F. Topp W.C. Watson J.D. The Transformed Phenotype 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1984: 169-176Google Scholar). K5 is also present in ameloblasts (10Kasper M. Karsten U. Stosiek P. Moll R. Differentiation. 1989; 40: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 11Domingues M.G. Jaeger M.M.M. Araujo V.C. Araujo N.S. Eur. J. Oral. Sci. 2000; 108: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The pairing of K5 with K14 requires N-terminal regions of both cytokeratins (12Wilson A.K. Coulombe P.A. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 401-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that, if the N-terminal region (GMp motif) of K14 is bound to the ATMP motif of amelogenin, it may not pair with K5 until amelogenin is disassociated from it. Furthermore, we hypothesize that K5, per se, might also bind to amelogenin, because it may carry GlcNAc at the N-terminal residues similar to other Type II keratins (K8) (13Omary M.B. Ku N.O. Liao J. Price D. Subcell. Biochem. 1998; 31: 105-140PubMed Google Scholar). If K5 were to bind to amelogenin, it might define the relative role of Type I and II cytokeratins in secretion of amelogenin. If pairing of K14 and K5 were to occur in ameloblasts, it would be important to define the event in the context of amelogenin secretion and enamel formation. We present evidence to show that K5 binds to amelogenin, leading to the secretion of amelogenin and pairing with K14. The in vitro and in situ observations, during different stages of enamel formation, define the interactions among amelogenin and cytokeratins. The pairing of K14 with K5 does occur after secretion of amelogenin and just prior to the disintegration of cytokeratins. These findings are novel and critical, and they define the relative role of cytokeratins in the secretion of amelogenin during enamel formation. The results are important for understanding the events taking place during secretion of amelogenin and enamel formation, and the development of corrective measures to prevent abnormal enamel development in genetic disorders like AI and different kinds of epidermolysis bullosa caused by mutations in K14 or K5 (14Coulombe P.A.

Mice—All observations were made on Swiss Webster mice at different developmental stages ranging from newborn day “0” through postnatal days (PN) 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. A total of 25 normal, healthy, female pregnant Swiss Webster mice (Charles River Breeding) were used to obtain a sufficient number of litters as was carried out previously (8Ravindranath R.M.H.

The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Los Angeles, CA) approved all protocols involving mice. Isolation and Purification of K5—We have isolated and purified K5 from HeLa cells (19Taddei A. Roche D. Sibarita J.-B. Turner B.M. Almouzni G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1153-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). We have obtained HeLa cells (CCL-2 obtained from ATCC) and have grown them in Eagle's minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C. The cells were collected and frozen at -20 °C. The proteins were extracted as previously described (20Sun T.T. Eichner R. Nelson W.G. Vidrich A. Woodcock-Mitchell J. Curr. Probl. Dermatol. 1983; 11: 277-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Vidrich A. Gilmartin M.E. Mitchell J. Freedberg I.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1985; 455: 354-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The keratin fraction was obtained from cells that were homogenized in equal volumes of ice-cold Tris-Triton buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The extract was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 2 min. The pellet was extracted three times with Tris-Triton buffer. The supernatant fractions contain most of the soluble cellular proteins, including many membrane proteins. The pellet was washed in Tris buffer and then dispersed in double the volume of Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with 1 m KCl, incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and once again centrifuged for 10,000 × g for 30 min. The final pellet was solubilized in about 1.5 volumes of buffered urea-β-mercaptoethanol (BME) solution (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 9 m urea, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm BME, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The extracted proteins were purified by the USC Microchemical Core Laboratory, using a reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatograph (C18 analytical column with a gradient of 0–100% B in 45 min; buffer B contained 70% (v/v) aqueous acetonitrile, 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid; buffer A contained 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). Protein concentrations were determined by Lowry et al. (23Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.H. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and purity and homogeneity were assessed by affinity-purified monoclonal antibody for K5. The antibodies used included mouse anti-K5 (1:1000) (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) and sheep monoclonal K5 antibody (1:100) (Binding Site, Birmingham, UK). The availability of a source of defined and purified K5 has now permitted us to study the binding properties of this molecule with amelogenins. Protein Preparations from Ameloblasts—We have isolated ameloblasts from mouse postnatal mandibular first molars at different developmental stages ranging from newborn day “0” through postnatal (PN) days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. Isolated ameloblasts were pooled, frozen, and thawed (four cycles) to extract the proteins as described with modifications previously used (20Sun T.T. Eichner R. Nelson W.G. Vidrich A.

The cytokeratin fraction was obtained from cells that were homogenized with approximately three volumes of ice-cold Tris-HCl (Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with 1 m urea, 100 μm EDTA, 10 mm BME). The homogenates were incubated for about 30 min at 37 °C and then centrifuged for 5 min at 8,000 × g in a Beckman Microfuge 12, and the supernatant was collected. The proteins from the supernatants were isolated using a Microcon concentrator with a cut-off size of 10,000 and centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 12 min. The protein fraction was collected and stored at -20 °C until further use. Equivalent amounts of isolated proteins (∼20 μg), as assessed by spectrophotometry (23Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.H. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were added to the gel (4–12% gradient SDS-PAGE).

After washing, a substrate (O-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride, Invitrogen) in citrate-phosphate buffer and hydrogen peroxidase was added to the plates for color development. The enzymatic oxidation was arrested after 30 min in the dark, with 6 n H2SO4. The absorbency difference at 490 – 650 nm was measured after automix in a microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The values were corrected for background (wells without antigen). Ovalbumin was used as a positive control because it contains two residues of terminal GlcNAc (25Silva M.L.C. Stubbs H.J. Tamura T. Rice K.G. Arch. Biochem.

After washing and drying, the membranes were exposed to hyperfilm-3H (Amersham Biosciences) for 5 days at 4 °C, and the films were developed manually. To assess whether [3H]ATMP binds GlcNAc residues of K5, we treated blots of K5 on PVDF membranes, after blocking with PBS, 1% HSA for 1 h at 37 °C, N-acetyl glucosaminidase recombinant from Escherichia coli (A6805, Sigma). 100 μl (5 units) of the enzyme suspension (in PBS, pH 7.00) was overlaid on two strips. Control strips were overlaid with blocking buffer. A thin strip of Parafilm was placed over the solution to retain the enzyme at one location. The overlaid strips were incubated at room temperature (1 h) and at 37 °C for 90 min. After washing with the PBS, 0.1% HSA, 0.005% Tween 20, the strips were incubated in sealer bags with [3H]ATMP (8 × 105 dpm/ml) resuspended in PBS (pH 7.2) for 18 h at 4 °C.

Protein transfer was assessed as described previously. After blocking the membrane with 1% HSA in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C and washing, the membranes were overlaid with K5 alone or K5 preincubated (for 1 h) with ATMP or K5 preincubated with T-ATMP or F-ATMP.

Morphometry of Enamel and Ameloblast during Development—The serial sections (6 μm) were obtained from paraffin-embedded mouse mandibular incisors on different postnatal days and stained with Mallory. The width of enamel and length of ameloblasts were measured at the 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% levels from the base of the incisor using the software program Image-Pro Plus 4.0 (Media Cybernetics). At each level, the mean width and length were obtained after measuring nine sections (three incisors from three mice).

Based on agonist affinity profiles, they can be subdivided into three subfamilies: α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA),1N-methyl-d-aspartate, and kainate receptors (1Hollmann M.

Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6634-6647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), has provided the first direct structural insight into how the changes at the ligand binding site lead to the sequence of conformational changes that regulate ion flow in this class of important proteins (5Armstrong N.A. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 6Sun Y. Olson R. Horning M. Armstrong N. Mayer M. Gouaux E. Nature. 2002; 417: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). The validity of these inferences hinges on the assumption that the ligand binding domain is the same in the model construct as in the native receptor (Fig. 1). There is no direct structural (x-ray or spectroscopy-based) comparison between the S1S2 protein and the native receptor, which would clearly indicate whether the S1S2 protein is a good model for the ligand binding domain in the full receptor. The assumption that the S1S2 protein is a representative model of the domain in the full glutamate receptor is currently based on equilibrium ligand binding assays that suggest similar ligand binding properties for the two proteins (11Kuusinen A. Arvola M. Keinänen K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6327-6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 12Chen G.-Q. Sun Y. Jin R. Gouaux E. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2623-2630Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In the present report using absorption spectroscopy, which is sensitive to changes in the ligand binding domain, we establish that the electronic environment and therefore structural environment of the ligand binding site is the same in the S1S2 and in the native receptor. Perhaps the most noteworthy aspect of this approach is that it is straightforward to conduct visible absorption spectroscopy on cells in their native state without the need to make model constructs or purify the full receptors expressed in cells. The GluR2-S1S2 construct containing the S1 segment (amino acids 390–506 in the GluR2 sequence) and the S2 segment (amino acids 632–763 in the GluR2 sequence) with the two domains being linked together via an amino acid linker (GT) was kindly provided by Dr. Gouaux (Columbia University, New York, NY) (5Armstrong N.A. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). The protein was expressed, purified, and characterized as described by Chen et al. (13Chen G.-Q. Gouaux E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13431-13436Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The digestion and purity of the protein was tested using SDS-PAGE, and the activity (ligand binding) was tested by measuring the Kd values using fluorescence spectroscopy. GluR4-S1S2 was kindly provided by Dr. Madden (Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH). HEK-293 (ATCC CRL 1573) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 2 mm glutamine, 50 μg/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. One day before transfection, cells were replated in 35-mm culture dishes coated with rat tail collagen (Sigma). Transfections were performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) transfection reagent with 1–2 μg of glutamate receptor cDNA. The plasmid encoding for the GluR4-flip subunit of the glutamate receptors used for the transfection was generously provided by Dr. Seeburg (Max Planck Institute, Heidelberg, Germany). Transfected cells were allowed to grow for 1–3 days before use. The UV-visible absorption spectra were obtained using Agilent 8453 or Shimadzu UV 2501 spectrometers (photometric repeatability of 0.0003 absorbance units) and analyzed using Gram's Spectral Notebase (Thermo Galactic, Salem, NH). The spectra were collected in the range of 500–250 nm with a sampling interval of 1 nm using a 1-cm quartz cuvette. The absorption spectra for GluR2-S1S2 and GluR4-S1S2 were obtained using 10 μmprotein and 20 μm6-cyano-7-nitro-2,3-dihydroxyquinoxaline (CNQX). For the absorption experiments with HEK-293 cells the number of cells used was such that the background due to scattering from cells was 0.7 absorbance units at 310 nm; this ensured that the total absorption was less than 1 absorption unit upon adding 20 μm CNQX. When determining the difference absorption spectra for GluR4-S1S2 and GluR2-S1S2 using competitive ligands, parallel control experiments were performed by adding the corresponding concentrations of ligands to 20 μm CNQX in buffer to ensure that no spectral changes were observed due to ligand-CNQX interactions. Similarly for the HEK-293 cells the difference spectra have been corrected for any differences arising due to nonspecific changes in the CNQX spectrum that arise due to the addition of ionic ligands by performing parallel control experiments using HEK-293 cells that have not been transfected. Specifically difference spectra were obtained between the spectra for homogenized non-transfected HEK-293 cells with 20 μm CNQX in the presence and absence of competitive ligands. Small differences were observed only at millimolar concentrations of competitive ligands, and these were subtracted from the corresponding difference spectra generated for transiently transfected cells. A logistic equation (Equation 1) was used to fit the dose-response curves to obtain the IC50 values for the agonists competing with CNQX. y=min+max−min1+10log(IC50)−log(x)Equation 1 where min and max are the minimum and maximum yvalues, respectively, in the dose-response curves. The IC50values thus obtained were used to calculate the Kdvalues for the various agonists using the corrected Cheng-Prusoff equation (14Munson P.J. Rodbard D. J. Recept. Res. 1988; 8: 533-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) (Equation 2).Kd1=IC501+y+p(y+2)2Kd2(y+1)−Kd2yy+2Equation 2 where y is the ratio of the bound to free concentrations of CNQX before the addition of competitive agonist,p is the total initial concentration of CNQX (20 μm), Kd2 is the dissociation constant for CNQX, and Kd1 is the dissociation constant for the agonist. The bound and free concentrations of CNQX were calculated using Kd2 and the protein concentration (10 μm for GluR2-S1S2). For calculating the Kd value for glutamate binding to GluR4 receptors expressed in HEK-293 cells, the Cheng-Prusoff equation (Equation 3) was used since the concentration of protein was significantly lower, and therefore depletion of CNQX was small.Kd1=IC501+[CNQX]Kd2Equation 3 A number of ligands bind with high specificity to the glutamate family of receptors. Of particular interest is CNQX, which exhibits electronic transitions in the visible region as evidenced by its orange/red color. Moreover CNQX exists in a unique electronic configuration when bound to the S1S2 protein as established by the dramatic changes in its infrared vibrational modes (9Madden D.R. Thiran S. Zimmermann H. Romm J. Jayaraman V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37821-37826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The difference in the electronic configurations of the free and protein-bound forms of CNQX is expected to be reflected in its absorption spectra. The UV-visible absorption spectra of CNQX bound to GluR2-S1S2 and in the free form are shown in Fig. 2. A decrease in the absorption is observed at 330 and 343 nm upon CNQX binding to the protein. Based on the wavelength as well as on the structure of CNQX (extended conjugation and presence of a nitro group) these absorbance bands are expected to arise from Π-Π* orn-Π* transitions. The change in the absorption spectral features are highlighted by examining the difference absorption spectrum (shown in Fig. 3). These changes in the absorption and the underlying changes in the electronic environment could arise due to specific and nonspecific binding of CNQX. By conducting a series of competitive binding studies we have identified that the changes in the absorption spectra are mainly due to specific binding of CNQX to the GluR2-S1S2. Specifically we have examined the competition with glutamate receptor agonists such as glutamate (Fig. 3B), AMPA (Fig. 3C), kainate (Fig. 3D), and a non-binding compound, γ-aminobutyric acid (Fig. 3E). The difference spectrum between the bound and unbound forms of CNQX is only observed upon selective displacement of CNQX from the ligand binding site and not with a nonspecific binding compound. Additionally we have investigated the changes in the absorption spectrum of CNQX due to changes in pH and in the presence of dimethylsulfoxide as a solvent (Fig. 4). These studies clearly indicate that the differences in the absorbance bands due to CNQX binding to S1S2 protein cannot be mimicked by changes in the electronic environment of CNQX induced by changes in pH and solvent, thus indicating that the differences in the absorbance bands of CNQX upon binding to S1S2 is unique to the environment of the ligand binding site in S1S2.Figure 3Difference absorption spectra between 20 μmCNQX in buffer and CNQX in the presence of GluR2-S1S2 (A) and 20 μmCNQX bound to GluR2-S1S2 in the presence and absence of 500 μmAMPA(B), 500 μmglutamate (C), 500 μm kainate (D), and 500 μmγ-aminobutyric acid (E).

Specifically, since the absorbance is directly proportional to the concentration of the chromophore (CNQX), a quantitative measure of the concentration of CNQX dissociated from the binding site can be obtained from the integrated area of the difference spectral features (320–353 nm). Based on this, dose-response curves were obtained for the displaced CNQX at various concentrations of competitive agonists, and the dissociation constants of the competitive agonists were determined. A plot of the integral areas as a function of the concentration of the competitive ligands is shown in Fig. 5for various ligands added to a solution containing CNQX bound to GluR2-S1S2. Using a logistic fit for these dose-response curves the IC50 values were determined to be 7 ± 2, 22 ± 5, and 115 ± 25 μm for AMPA, glutamate, and kainate, respectively. Based on these IC50 values, using the corrected Cheng-Prusoff equation (14Munson P.J. Rodbard D. J. Recept. Res. 1988; 8: 533-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) (corrected for ligand depletion; see “Experimental Procedures” for details), theKd values were determined for AMPA, glutamate, and kainate (shown in Table I). These values are in good agreement with the values previously reported based on radioactive ligand binding experiments (Table I) (13Chen G.-Q. Gouaux E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13431-13436Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The ability to use the differences in the absorbance of CNQX to determine the affinities of various ligands makes this an excellent assay to screen for compounds that selectively bind to the this receptor.Table IThe dissociation constants for agonists of the glutamate receptor from GluR2-S1S2LigandAbsorptionRadioactive ligand binding1-aRef. 13.AMPA55 ± 15 nm25 nmGlutamate470 ± 110 nm455 nmKainate3 ± 0.7 μm8 μm1-a Ref. 13Chen G.-Q.

Open table in a new tab Since the difference spectrum provides a fingerprint of the local electronic structure of the ligand binding site, we used this to compare the structure of the isolated ligand binding domain with the same domain in the full receptor. For these investigations we have compared the difference absorption spectra for CNQX binding to the GluR4-S1S2 (isolated ligand binding domain of GluR4 subunit) and homomeric GluR4 receptors expressed in HEK-293 cells (Fig.6). The difference spectra are identical for the isolated domain and the native receptor. Additionally no spectral features were observed in displacement studies with a non-binding compound γ-aminobutyric acid, confirming that the spectral features shown in Fig. 6 arise due to specific binding of CNQX. Finally for a quantitative comparison a dose-response curve was obtained for competitive displacement of CNQX by glutamate from homomeric GluR4-flip receptors expressed in HEK-293 cells (Fig. 5,open squares). The IC50 value determined using a logistic fit was 20 ± 5 μm, similar to that obtained for GluR2-S1S2, and the corresponding Kdvalue for glutamate was 450 ± 110 nm assuming theKd for CNQX is 460 nm (15Keinänen K.

The results presented here provide definitive evidence that the electronic environment of CNQX is the same in the homomeric GluR4 glutamate receptors transiently expressed in HEK-293 cells as that in the isolated ligand binding domain, therefore clearly indicating that the GluR2-S1S2 and GluR4-S1S2 are good models for the ligand binding domain in the native receptor, thus providing additional validation for the structure-function insights currently available based on the atomic level structure of GluR2-S1S2.

Here we report that Thermotoga maritima MazG protein (Tm-MazG), the product of the TM0913 gene, has both nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase (NTPase) and pyrophosphatase activities. Tm-MazG catalyzes the hydrolysis of all eight canonical ribo- and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates to their corresponding nucleoside monophosphates and PPi and subsequently hydrolyzes the resultant PPi to Pi. The NTPase activity with deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates as substrate is higher than corresponding ribonucleoside triphosphates. dGTP is the best substrate among the deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, and GTP is the best among the ribonucleoside triphosphates. Both NTPase and pyrophosphatase activities were enhanced at higher temperatures and blocked by the α,β-methyleneadenosine triphosphate, which cannot be hydrolyzed by Tm-MazG. Furthermore, PPi is an inhibitor for the Tm-MazG NTPase activity.

An oxidized form of dGTP, 8-oxo-dGTP, is a potent mutagenic substrate for DNA synthesis to induce A:T to C:G transversion. 8-Oxo-dGTP can be hydrolyzed and eliminated from the nucleotide pool by MutT protein to prevent misincorporation of 8-oxo-dGTP into DNA (6Maki H.

The function of this protein family has been proposed to eliminate minor potentially mutagenic purine nucleoside triphosphates from cell.The genomic DNA of Thermotoga maritima has been sequenced (21Nelson K.E.

In this paper, we demonstrated that the MazG protein from T. maritima (Tm-MazG), unlike E. coli MazG, has not only the NTPase activity but also the pyrophosphatase activity, converting (d)NTP to (d)NMP and PPi and subsequently hydrolyzing the resultant PPi to Pi. By the site-directed mutagenesis, the amino acid residues involved in both enzymatic activities were identified. We demonstrated that Tm-MazG has dual enzymatic functions, NTPase and pyrophosphatase, and that these activities are coordinated probably by having partially overlapping active sites.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Enzyme—Restriction enzymes and DNA-modifying enzymes used for cloning were from New England Biolabs. Pfu DNA polymerase was from Stratagene. Radioactive nucleotides were from Amersham Biosciences. Nucleoside triphosphates and AMPCPP were purchased from Sigma. Pyrophosphate was provided from the PiPer pyrophosphate assay kit purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR).Strains and Plasmids—The genomic DNA of T. maritima was used as template for PCR to amplify the TM0931 gene with primer 1,5′-GAATTCCATATGAAAGAGGCAGGAATCCTCTTC-3′ (an NdeI site is underlined) and primer 2,5′-CCCAAGCTTTCATGTTTCATCTCCTCCCTTCG-3′ (a HindIII site is underlined). The PCR product was digested with NdeI and HindIII and cloned into the NdeI-HindIII site of pET17b. This plasmid was designated as pET17b-Tm-MazG. pET17b-Tm-MazG was introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3) strain for protein expression.Protein Expression and Purification—The E. coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring the pET17b-Tm-MazG were grown to midexponential phase in M9 medium supplemented with 0.2% casamino acid and 50 μg of ampicillin/ml, and then the expression of Tm-MazG was induced in the presence of 1 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in buffer A (100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and then lysed through a French press followed by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris and unbroken cells and by ultracentrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 h to remove membrane and insoluble fractions. The supernatant was treated at 80 °C for 15 min and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min to remove denatured E. coli proteins. The resulting supernatant was loaded on a Q-Sepharose column and eluted with buffer A using a gradient of 0.1–1 m potassium phosphate. Fractions containing Tm-MazG were pooled together and dialyzed with buffer B (10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The protein sample was then loaded onto a hydroxyapatite column (Bio-Rad), which had been equilibrated with buffer B. Tm-MazG was eluted with buffer B using a gradient of 0.01–1 m potassium phosphate. The fractions containing purified Tm-MazG were pooled together and concentrated. Protein concentrations were measured with the Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent. The Tm-MazG mutants indicated in Fig. 7 were constructed by site-directed mutation. All of the Tm-MazG mutant proteins were purified with the same protocol as mentioned above.Enzyme Assay—With α-32P-labeled nucleoside triphosphates as substrates, the NTPase activity of Tm-MazG was assayed by measuring the hydrolyzed products from the α-32P-labeled nucleoside triphosphates by TLC. The assay was carried out in 20 μl of reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2,and1mm DTT) containing α-32P-labeled nucleoside triphosphate and an appropriate amount of Tm-MazG at 70 °C for 10 min. The reaction mixture (5 μl) was mixed with 5 μl of stop solution (2% SDS and 20 mm EDTA) to terminate the reaction. Each terminated reaction mixture (2 μl) was spotted onto a polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plate, which was then developed in 0.75 m KH2PO4 (pH 3.3). The corresponding unlabeled nucleoside triphosphates were spotted alongside. The dried plates were exposed to x-ray films to identify the hydrolyzed products. Spots of unlabeled nucleoside triphosphates were visualized by UV shadowing.With γ-32P-labeled nucleoside triphosphates as substrates, the NTPase activity of Tm-MazG was measured as follows. The reaction mixture (20 μl) contained 100 μm nucleoside triphosphate, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 1 μg of Tm-MazG protein. The reaction was carried out at 70 °C for 10 min and terminated by the addition of 20 μl of a mixture of four parts of 20% Norit A (Sigma) and one part of 7% perchloric acid. After mixing and incubating for 2 min on ice, the mixture was centrifuged, and the radioactivity of the supernatant was measured with a liquid scintillation counter.The pyrophosphatase activity was detected with pyrophosphate as substrate. The reaction mixture (20 μl) contained 1 mm pyrophosphate, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 1 μg of Tm-MazG protein. The reaction was carried out at 70 °C for 10 min and terminated by the addition of 5 μl of the stop solution. The amount of Pi released was measured by the standard colorimetric assay method as described by Ames and Dubin (22Ames B.N. Dubin D T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Substrate Specificity of Tm-MazG Protein—The specificity of nucleotide hydrolysis by Tm-MazG protein was examined using various nucleoside triphosphates. The reactions were performed at 70 °C for 10 min in 20 μl of reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 μg of Tm-MazG protein. Rates of hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates were determined with six different concentrations of the substrates from 0.1 to 2 mm. Under these conditions, the velocity of the reaction was linear with time. Amounts of (d)NMP product were measured, and the kinetic parameters were calculated from the average values of three independent experiments.Detection of Pyrophosphate—Nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis assays were performed as mentioned above with [γ-32P]GTP as substrate. The reaction mixture (5 μl) was mixed with 5 μl of the stop solution to terminate the reaction. The samples (1 μl) were spotted onto a Whatman 3MM paper, which was then developed in a solution containing n-butyl alcohol, n-propyl alcohol, acetone, 80% formic acid, and 30% trichloroacetic acid at a ratio of 40:20:25:25:15 (v/v/v/v/v) in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml EDTA. Then the Whatman 3MM paper was autoradiographed to identify products from [γ-32P]GTP. The unlabeled monophosphate and pyrophosphate were analyzed alongside and visualized as described by Schwemmle and Staeheli (23Schwemmle M. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11299-11305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).RESULTSCloning, Expression, and Purification—MazG family proteins are highly conserved among bacteria. The TM0913 gene, encoding the MazG homolog in T. maritima, was cloned as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Its original GTG start codon was changed to ATG. Expression of the gene cloned in pET-Tm-MazG plasmid transformed in E. coli BL21(DE3) resulted in a major band on an SDS-PAGE gel, corresponding to about 20% of total cellular protein. The cell lysate was incubated at 80 °C for 15 min and centrifuged to remove denatured E. coli proteins. At this stage, MazG was substantially purified. Tm-MazG was subsequently purified by column chromatography with Q-Sepharose and hydroxyapatite columns, resulting in a highly homogenous protein band in SDS-PAGE. The molecular mass of this product was 29,728 Da as determined by mass spectrometry, which agrees well with the predicted mass of 29,674 Da for recombinant Tm-MazG without the N-terminal Met residue. Thermal denaturation of Tm-MazG protein was examined using a far-UV CD spectropolarimeter. Tm-MazG was very stable at high temperature, and no change was detected up to 85 °C. The purified Tm-MazG showed a CD spectrum of a typical protein containing both α-helixes and β-sheets (data not shown).Tm-MazG Converts (d)NTP to (d)NMP—The purified Tm-MazG was incubated with [α-32P]ATP, [α-32P]dATP, [α-32P]GTP, or [α-32P]dGTP at 70 °C for 10 min, and then the nucleotide analysis was performed by polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer chromatography. It was found that Tm-MazG could convert ATP/dATP to AMP/dAMP and GTP/dGTP to GMP/dGMP with no detectable nucleoside diphosphate products (Fig. 1A). Further studies revealed that GDP and ADP could not be hydrolyzed by Tm-MazG (data not shown).Fig. 1Nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase activity of Tm-MazG.A, conversion of ATP, dATP, GTP, and dGTP to their corresponding monophosphates by Tm-MazG. Reactions were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” with [α-32P]ATP (lane 2), [α-32P]dATP (lane 4), [α-32P]GTP (lane 6), or [α-32P]dGTP (lane 8) as substrate. Lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7 are the controls of each reaction without Tm-MazG. The hydrolysis products were assayed by polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer chromatography. B, the GTP hydrolysis activity of Tm-MazG in the presence of nucleotide competitors. The GTP hydrolysis assays were carried out in a 20-μl reaction mixture with 10 μm GTP, 10 μCi of [α-32P]GTP, and 0.5 μg of Tm-MazG at 70 °C for 10 min in the presence of 4 mm nucleotide competitor. The hydrolysis products were assayed by polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer chromatography. The amounts of [α-32P]GMP produced were estimated with a PhosphorImager. The hydrolysis activity with each nucleotide competitor indicated was depicted relative to the activity without any nucleotide competitor, which was taken as 100%. Each value is the mean from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)With [α-32P]GTP as substrate for Tm-MazG, the GTP hydrolysis activity was tested with unlabeled nucleoside triphosphates as competitors. In the presence of 4 mm competitors (400-fold excess), GTP hydrolysis was effectively blocked by all of the eight canonical nucleoside triphosphates, among which CTP was the strongest competitor. The ribonucleoside triphosphates were stronger competitors than the corresponding deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (Fig. 1B).The general kinetic parameters for hydrolysis of the eight canonical nucleoside triphosphates by Tm-MazG were measured (Table I). Among the various nucleoside triphosphates used, the hydrolytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of deoxynucleoside triphosphates was higher than that of the corresponding ribonucleoside triphosphates. dGTP was the most preferred substrate for Tm-MazG among deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, and GTP was the most preferred among ribonucleoside triphosphates. The Km values for the ribonucleoside triphosphates were lower than those for the corresponding deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates except that for GTP, which was similar to that for dGTP. Consistent with the competition experiment results described above, the ribonucleoside triphosphates were stronger competitors, and CTP with the lowest Km value is the strongest inhibitor (Fig. 1B, column 5).Table IComparison of the nucleotide substrate specificity of Tm-MazGSubstrateKmVmaxkcatkcat/KmRelative kcat/KmmMnmol/min/μgmin-1min-1 mM-1dGTP1.0 ± 0.31.90 ± 0.1256.6 ± 3.556.0100dCTP1.7 ± 0.12.00 ± 0.7459.6 ± 2.134.361dTTP1.5 ± 0.41.30 ± 0.5638.7 ± 6.726.547dATP3.2 ± 0.82.25 ± 0.9667.2 ± 8.620.937GTP1.0 ± 0.11.39 ± 0.1141.4 ± 3.240.673CTP0.4 ± 0.10.22 ± 0.036.4 ± 1.017.932ATP1.0 ± 0.30.39 ± 0.1611.82 ± 4.711.921UTP1.1 ± 0.20.36 ± 0.0510.6 ± 1.69.818 Open table in a new tab Production of Piwith Pyrophosphate as an Intermediate Product—As shown above, Tm-MazG converts (d)NTP to (d)NMP without any detectable production of (d)NDP. Therefore, pyrophosphate should be another product of the Tm-MazG-catalyzed nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis. To detect the pyrophosphate product in the reaction mixture, the hydrolysis reaction was performed with [γ-32P]GTP as substrate for Tm-MazG (1 μg), and the reaction products were analyzed by paper chromatography and visualized by autoradiography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A radioactive spot was observed at the position of Pi but not at the position of pyrophosphate, whether the reaction was performed at 37 °C (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 6) or 70 °C (Fig. 2A, lanes 8 and 9). The same results were obtained from the experiments performed at various other temperatures even for shorter reaction times (data not shown). However, with E. coli MazG (1 μg) the radioactive signal was observed only at the position of pyrophosphate (Fig. 2A, lane 2), and it shifted to the position of Pi only when the reaction mixture was treated with yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase (Fig. 2A, lane 3). Even if 10 μgof E. coli MazG was used, only PPi and no Pi was detected in the products of E. coli MazG-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis (data not shown). These results indicate that E. coli MazG hydrolyzes GTP to GMP and PPi, whereas Tm-MazG is able to convert GTP to GMP and Pi.Fig. 2Product analysis of Tm-MazG-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis.A, production of Pi in the Tm-MazG-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis. The reaction was performed in a 20-μl reaction mixture with 100 μm GTP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]GTP. Samples were analyzed by paper chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Lane 1, control without protein; lane 2, with 1 μg of E. coli MazG at 37 °C for 10 min; lane 3, the sample in lane 2 was treated with 0.5 units of yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase at 37 °C for 10 min. Lane 4, control without protein; lane 5, with 1 μg of Tm-MazG at 37 °C for 5 min; lane 6, with 1 μg of Tm-MazG at 37 °C for 10 min.

B, production of pyrophosphate in the Tm-MazG-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis reaction as an intermediate product. The reaction was carried out at 70 °C for 5 min. Lane 1, control without Tm-MazG; lane 2, with 1 μg of Tm-MazG; lanes 3–6, with 1 μg of Tm-MazG at various concentrations of pyrophosphate as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The results above indicate that Tm-MazG has not only NTPase but also pyrophosphatase activity that effectively hydrolyzes pyrophosphate, a primary product of the NTPase activity, to Pi. In order to prove that pyrophosphate is a primary product of the NTPase activity, nonradioactive pyrophosphate was added into the Tm-MazG-catalyzed [γ-32P]GTP hydrolysis reaction mixture at various concentrations, since the degradation of newly formed radiolabeled pyrophosphate is expected to be inhibited in the presence of excess nonradioactive pyrophosphate. As shown in Fig. 2B, the accumulation of radiolabeled pyrophosphate was detectable in the presence of 2 mm pyrophosphate (Fig. 2B, lane 3), indicating that pyrophosphate is indeed produced in the Tm-MazG-catalyzed [γ-32P]GTP hydrolysis. With 5 mm pyrophosphate in the reaction mixture, the amount of radiolabeled pyrophosphate was dramatically reduced (Fig. 2B, lane 4), and it was not detectable in the presence of 10 and 25 mm pyrophosphate (Fig. 2B, lanes 5 and 6), indicating that pyrophosphate does function as an inhibitor for the NTPase activity at higher concentrations. The inhibitory effect of pyrophosphate on the NTPase activity was further confirmed by another experiment, in which the GTP hydrolysis reaction was carried out with [α-32P]GTP (100 μM) as substrate in the presence of various concentrations of pyrophosphate (Fig. 3). It was found that GTP hydrolysis activity, as detected by the production of [α-32P]GMP, was decreased with higher pyrophosphate concentrations (Fig. 3, lanes 2–4), and the GTP hydrolysis was almost completely blocked at 5 mm pyrophosphate (Fig. 3, lane 4). With ATP as substrate for Tm-MazG, Pi released could be detected by the standard colorimetric assay, whereas almost no Pi production was detected with AMPCPP as substrate under the same reaction condition (Fig. 4A), indicating that AMPCPP, in which the linkage between α- and β-phosphates is not a phosphodiester bond, cannot be hydrolyzed by Tm-MazG. These results indicated that, in the Tm-MazG-catalyzed (d)NTP hydrolysis reaction, (d)NTP is first hydrolyzed between α- and β-phosphates, yielding (d)NMP and PPi, and subsequently the resultant PPi is hydrolyzed to Pi.Fig. 3Inhibition of the Tm-MazG-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis by pyrophosphate. GTP hydrolysis reactions were carried out at 70 °C for 10 min in 20 μl of reaction mixture with 100 μm GTP, 10 μCi of [α-32P]GTP, and 1 μg of Tm-MazG at various concentrations of pyrophosphate.

As shown in Fig. 4A, Tm-MazG indeed did have pyrophosphatase activity that directly hydrolyzed PPi to Pi (Fig. 4A, column 3). Although the Tm-MazG preparation was purified from E. coli by heat treatment, one cannot exclude a possibility that the pyrophosphatase activity detected in Tm-MazG might be due to E. coli pyrophosphatase contamination. Therefore, we next examined the temperature dependence of the NTPase and pyrophosphatase activities. As shown in Fig. 5, both enzymatic activities increase as the reaction temperature increases, and the optimal temperatures are ∼80 °C for both enzymatic activities, which is expected for a T. maritima protein. The NTPase activity of Tm-MazG increased more than 10 times from 30 to 80 °C (Fig. 5A), whereas the NTPase activity of E. coli MazG was the highest at 37 °C and dropped at 80 °C to only a few percent of that at 37 °C (data not shown). It has been reported that the activity of the E. coli pyrophosphatase is severely inhibited at higher temperatures (24Satoh T. Takahashi Y. Oshida N. Shimizu A. Shinoda H. Watanabe M. Samejima T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1531-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the pyrophosphatase activity is an intrinsic enzymatic activity of Tm-MazG.Fig. 5The effects of temperature on the NTPase and pyrophosphatase activities of Tm-MazG.A, the NTPase assay was performed in a 20-μl reaction mixture with 100 μm GTP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]GTP, and 1 μg of Tm-MazG for 10 min at various temperatures as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, the pyrophosphatase assay was performed in a 20-μl reaction mixture with 1 mm pyrophosphate and 1 μg of Tm-MazG for 10 min at various temperatures.

https://openalex.org/W2093251472,"Soluble methane monooxygenase requires complexes between its three component proteins for efficient catalysis. The hydroxylase (MMOH) must bind both to the reductase (MMOR) and to the regulatory protein (MMOB) to facilitate oxidation of methane to methanol. Although structures of MMOH, MMOB, and one domain of MMOR have been determined, less geometric information is available for the complexes. To address this deficiency, MMOH and MMOR were cross-linked by a carbodiimide reagent and analyzed by specific proteolysis, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and capillary high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Tandem mass spectra conclusively identified two amine-to-carboxylate cross-linked sites involving the α subunit of MMOH and the [2Fe-2S] domain of MMOR (MMOR-Fd). In particular, the N terminus of the MMOH α subunit forms cross-links to the side chains of MMOR-Fd residues Glu-56 and Glu-91. These Glu residues are close to one another on the surface of MMOR-Fd and >25 Å from the [2Fe-2S] cluster. Because the N terminus of the α subunit of MMOH was not located in the crystal structure of MMOH, a detailed structural model of the complex based on the cross-link was precluded; however, a previously proposed binding site for MMOR on MMOH could be ruled out. Based on the cross-linking results, a MMOR E56Q/E91Q double mutant was generated. The mutant retains >80% of MMOR NADH oxidase activity but reduces sMMO activity to ∼65% of the level supported by the wild type reductase. Cross-linking to MMOH was diminished but not abolished in the double mutant, indicating that other residues of MMOR also form cross-links to MMOH.

In particular, the N terminus of the MMOH α subunit forms cross-links to the side chains of MMOR-Fd residues Glu-56 and Glu-91. These Glu residues are close to one another on the surface of MMOR-Fd and >25 Å from the [2Fe-2S] cluster. Because the N terminus of the α subunit of MMOH was not located in the crystal structure of MMOH, a detailed structural model of the complex based on the cross-link was precluded; however, a previously proposed binding site for MMOR on MMOH could be ruled out. Based on the cross-linking results, a MMOR E56Q/E91Q double mutant was generated. The mutant retains >80% of MMOR NADH oxidase activity but reduces sMMO activity to ∼65% of the level supported by the wild type reductase. Cross-linking to MMOH was diminished but not abolished in the double mutant, indicating that other residues of MMOR also form cross-links to MMOH. Methanotrophic bacteria rely on metalloenzymes to catalyze methane hydroxylation (Equation 1), the first step in the metabolic pathway that supplies all their cellular carbon and energy. CH4+O2+NADH+H+→CH3OH+H2O+NAD+(Eq. 1) Methanotrophs express a membrane-bound enzyme termed particulate methane monooxygenase to convert methane to methanol. When copper is unavailable some methanotrophs, including Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) and Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b, employ an iron-containing soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) 1The abbreviations used are: sMMO, soluble methane monooxygenase; MMOH, hydroxylase protein of sMMO; MMOR, reductase protein of sMMO; MMOB, regulatory protein of sMMO; MMOR-Fd, ferredoxin domain (residues 1–98) of MMOR; MMOR-FAD, FAD and NAD(H) binding domains (residues 99–348) of MMOR; MMOR EQ2, double mutant (E56Q/E91Q) of MMOR; EDC, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide; QoTOF, quadrupole orthogonal time-of-flight; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization; MS, mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; LC, liquid chromatography; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.

The sMMO system comprises several proteins. The α2β2γ2 hydroxylase (MMOH, 251 kDa) contains a glutamate-bridged diiron active site in each α subunit. The crystal structure of MMOH has been determined in several redox states and with various products and substrate analogs bound (2Rosenzweig A.C. Nordlund P. Takahara P.M. Frederick C.A. Lippard S.J.

Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 556-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). An iron-sulfur flavoprotein reductase (MMOR, 38.5 kDa) transfers electrons from NADH to MMOH. The solution structure of the N-terminal [2Fe-2S] domain of MMOR is available (7Müller J. Lugovskoy A.A. Wagner G. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 42-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A cofactorless regulatory protein (MMOB, 15.9 kDa) alters the properties of the diiron site and is required for activity, and its solution structure has also been determined (8Walters K.J.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5799-5812Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A fourth protein (MMOD (component D of sMMO), 11.9 kDa) binds to the hydroxylase and inhibits catalysis in vitro, but its function has yet to be determined (1Merkx M. Kopp D.A. Sazinsky M.H. Blazyk J.L. Muller J. Lippard S.J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2001; 40: 2782-2807Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 10Merkx M. Lippard S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5858-5865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Complex formation between MMOH, MMOR, and MMOB is required for sMMO catalysis. The catalytic cycle begins with the diiron site of MMOH in its Fe(III)Fe(III) resting state. MMOR then docks to MMOH, transfers two electrons (derived from NADH) to each diiron(III) active site, and reduces MMOH to the Fe(II)Fe(II) state. In the presence of MMOB, reduced MMOH reacts with O2 to generate a series of intermediates that hydroxylate substrates. An MMOB:MMOH ratio of 2 produces maximal activity. Binding of MMOB also alters the redox potentials and spectroscopic properties of the diiron center in MMOH and accelerates electron transfer from MMOR (1Merkx M. Kopp D.A. Sazinsky M.H. Blazyk J.L. Muller J. Lippard S.J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2001; 40: 2782-2807Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of complexes involving these proteins in the catalytic cycle, only limited structural information is available about them. More than 10 years ago (11Fox B.G. Liu Y. Dege J.E. Lipscomb J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 540-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was demonstrated that the proteins of sMMO could be covalently cross-linked by the reagent 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC). SDS-PAGE analysis of the reaction products allowed identification of the polypeptides involved in cross-links. These early studies located some of the proximal polypeptides of the MMOH holoprotein before its crystal structure was available (11Fox B.G. Liu Y. Dege J.E. Lipscomb J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 540-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Rosenzweig A.C. Lippard S.J. Acc. Chem. Res. 1994; 27: 229-236Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Several other methods have been used to study complexes of the sMMO proteins. NMR titrations indicated specific residues on MMOB and MMOR-Fd that interact with MMOH (7Müller J. Lugovskoy A.A. Wagner G. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 42-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 8Walters K.J. Gassner G.T. Lippard S.J. Wagner G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Small-angle x-ray scattering studies led to a model of a ternary MMOH·MMOB·MMOR complex in which MMOH undergoes a large structural rearrangement (14Gallagher S.C. Callaghan A.J. Zhao J.K. Dalton H. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6752-6760Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Modification of positively charged residues on the surface of MMOH inhibits the binding of MMOB and electron transfer from MMOR (15Balendra S. Lesieur C. Smith T.J. Dalton H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2571-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Measurements of the distance between the hydroxylase diiron site and a site-directed spin label on MMOB provide information about where MMOB may contact MMOH (16MacArthur R. Sazinsky M.H. Kuhne H. Whittington D.A. Lippard S.J. Brudvig G.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 13392-13393Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the present study we have applied mass spectrometry to identify specific amino acid residues that are cross-linked by EDC in complexes of the sMMO proteins. Of particular interest were those cross-links between MMOHα, where the catalytic non-heme diiron center is located, and the other protein components. The results allow definitive statements to be made concerning the interaction of the ferredoxin domain of MMOR with MMOHα and pave the way to future experiments that apply this methodology. Reagents and General Techniques—The EDC cross-linking reagent was purchased from Pierce, and other biochemicals were from Sigma. Solvents used in LC runs were purchased from Burdick and Jackson (Muskeegon, MI) and were of high performance liquid chromatography grade or higher. Protein Purification—MMOH was isolated from cultures of M. capsulatus (Bath), as previously described (17Gassner G.T. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12768-12785Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous work, purified MMOH contained 3.9–4.0 mol of iron/mol of protein, and specific activity for conversion of propylene to propylene oxide at 45 °C was in the range 200–300 nmol min-1 mg-1 MMOH. Conditions for purification of recombinant MMOR, MMOR-FAD, and MMOR-Fd from Escherichia coli are reported elsewhere (18Kopp D.A. Gassner G.T. Blazyk J.L. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14932-14941Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 19Blazyk J.L. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15780-15794Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). EDC Cross-linking Reactions—Typically, solutions of 10–20 μm protein in 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, were allowed to react with 25 or 50 mm EDC for 5 min at ambient temperature. Reactions were quenched by the addition of an equal volume of 2× SDS loading buffer containing 200 mm dithiothreitol. In-gel Proteolytic Digestion—Aliquots of the products from the cross-linking reactions were separated by SDS-PAGE using either 7.5 or 4–20% Ready Gels (Bio-Rad). Gels were stained either with Coomassie Blue or with zinc. Zinc staining was carried out by soaking the gel in 0.2 m imidazole for 10 min, then rinsing briefly with water and incubating in 0.2 m ZnSO4. When the desired degree of opacity was reached, the zinc solution was removed, and the gel was stored in water. Bands of interest were excised from the gel with a clean razor blade, minced, and washed 3 times with 100 μl of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5, 50% acetonitrile, then dehydrated with 100 μl acetonitrile and dried in a centrifugal evaporator. Gel pieces were treated with 30 μl of 20 mm dithiothreitol in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate and 5% acetonitrile and incubated for 1 h at 55 °C. Dithiothreitol was removed by washing with 100 μl of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, then with 100 μl of acetonitrile. Cysteines were alkylated by adding 30 μl of 100 mm iodoacetamide in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate and incubating for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. Gel pieces were washed twice with 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate and acetonitrile before drying in a centrifugal evaporator. Gel pieces were rehydrated with a small volume of digestion solution (50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5, and sequencing grade trypsin (Sigma or Promega, Madison, WI). Trypsin was used at an enzyme: substrate ratio of ∼1:100 by weight. Digestion was allowed to proceed overnight at 37 °C. Peptides were extracted from the gel pieces with 100 μl of 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate followed by 2 extractions of 100 μl of 1:1 water: acetonitrile plus 1% trifluoroacetic acid and, finally, 1 extraction with 100 μl of acetonitrile. All extracts were combined in a fresh tube, flash-frozen, and dried in a centrifugal evaporator. Dried extracts were stored at -20 °C until analyzed. Mass Spectrometry—MALDI-TOF MS. Extracted peptides were analyzed using both the Finnigan MAT Vision 2000 MALDI-TOF (Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA) and the Bruker Reflex IV (Bremen, Germany) reflectron mass spectrometers equipped with ultraviolet lasers (nitrogen, 337 nm). The MALDI matrix was 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, and typically 50–200 laser shots were summed for each spectrum. The laser power used was between 33 and 60%. Capillary LC MS—An LC Packings capillary LC (Dionex; Cambridge, MA) coupled to an Applied Biosystems Inc. (Foster City, CA) Sciex QSTAR quadrupole orthogonal time-of-flight (QoTOF) mass spectrometer was employed using information-dependent acquisition. Peptide separation was achieved by using a 256-μm internal diameter × 20-cm homemade capillary column packed with Michrom (Auburn, CA) Magic C18 as the stationary phase. A 100-min gradient from 98:2 H2O:CH3CN with 0.1% HCOOH (A) and 85:10:5 CH3CN: CH3CHOHCH3:H2O with 0.1% HCOOH (B) going from 5% to 85% B was run at 1 μl/min. Eluent was sprayed at 4500 V, and tandem MS data were generated with collision energies of 16, 24, and 35 V for each selected peptide. Data from capillary LC runs were standardized by internal calibration. A mass selection window of ∼2.5–3 Da, dependent on mass value, was used allowing for isolation of the isotopic cluster. MS Data Analysis—LC/MS data were analyzed with QAnalyst software (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA). Tryptic peptide masses were calculated from amino acid sequences of sMMO proteins based on DNA sequencing results (20Coufal D.E. Blazyk J.L. Whittington D.A. Wu W.W. Rosenzweig A.C. Lippard S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2174-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) using the programs PEPTIDEMASS (21Wilkins M.R. Lindskog I. Gasteiger E. Bairoch A. Sanchez J.C. Hochstrasser D.F. Appel R.D. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) or GPMAW (22Peri S. Steen H. Pandey A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 687-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Observed masses were manually matched to calculated values to make assignments. Mascot (Matrix Science, Ltd., London, UK; www.matrixscience.com) was also used to analyze tandem MS data (23Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6776) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis—The MMOR variant carrying E56Q and E91Q mutations was prepared from the plasmid pRED21 according to the QuikChange method (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). pRED21 contains the M. capsulatus (Bath) mmoC gene in a pET21 vector. 2J. Müller and S. J. Lippard, unpublished results. The E56Q mutation was introduced first with the primer 5′-GCAAGGCCTTGTGCAGCCAAGGGACTACGACC-3′ and its reverse complement. Positive clones for the E56Q mutation were selected and sequenced at the MIT Biopolymers Laboratory using an ABI 3730 sequencer. The E91Q mutation was introduced in the E56Q background using the primer 5′-CCGAAGACCGACCCTGCAAATCGAACTGCCCTATAC-3′ and its reverse complement. The DNA sequence of the double mutant was similarly verified, and the plasmid pRED21 E56Q/E91Q was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). Expression and purification were carried out in the same manner as for MMOR (18Kopp D.A. Gassner G.T. Blazyk J.L. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14932-14941Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). MMOR E56Q/E91Q is hereafter designated MMOR EQ2. NADH Consumption Assays—The activity of sMMO was measured by combining 1 μm MMOH and 2 μm MMOB with varying amounts of MMOR or MMOR EQ2 (17Gassner G.T. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12768-12785Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Propylene-saturated buffer (25 mm MOPS, pH 7.0) was added to give a final propylene concentration of 0.8 mm. Reactions, thermostatted at 25 °C, were initiated by the addition of NADH to a final concentration of 160 μm in a total volume of 400 μl in a quartz cuvette. The absorbance at 340 nm was measured for 2 min, and the rate of NADH consumption was calculated as a linear fit of ΔA340versus time. Cross-linking of MMOR-Fd and MMOR to MMOHα—EDC facilitates formation of amide bonds between amine and carboxylate groups affording intra- or intermolecular protein cross-links (Fig. 1A). Products resulting from EDC cross-linking of MMOH, polypeptides, an MMOH·MMOR-Fd complex, and an MMOH·MMOR complex are revealed in Fig. 1B. MMOH alone forms several intramolecular cross-links, including MMOHα-MMOHβ, MMOHβ-MMOHβ, and with extended reaction times, MMOHα-MMOHβ-MMOHγ, where the hyphen denotes cross-link formation between two peptide chains. The band arising from cross-linking between MMOH and MMOR-Fd was assigned as MMOHα-MMOR-Fd based on its mobility and confirmed by proteolytic digestion and mass spectrometry (see below). Full-length MMOR also cross-links to MMOHα, in contrast to previous findings for sMMO from M. trichosporium OB3b (11Fox B.G. Liu Y. Dege J.E. Lipscomb J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 540-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The predicted molecular mass of an MMOHα-MMOR cross-link, 99.1 kDa, lies between those of MMOHα-MMOHβ (105.6 kDa) and MMOHβ-MMOHβ (90 kDa), and the band assigned to the MMOH-MMOR cross-link migrates at that position. If MMOR were cross-linked to MMOHβ, the resulting band would have a molecular mass of 83.5 kDa and would migrate more quickly than MMOHβ-MMOHβ on SDS-PAGE. Incubation of MMOH and the FAD domain of MMOR (MMOR-FAD) with EDC did not produce a cross-link (data not shown). Thus, the residues of MMOR that cross-link to MMOHα lie exclusively within the [2Fe-2S] domain of MMOR. A mixture of MMOR-Fd and MMOR-FAD did not cross-link upon treatment with EDC, suggesting that these domains do not interact strongly in the full-length protein. Electron transfer kinetics and isothermal titration calorimetry experiments support such a conclusion (19Blazyk J.L. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15780-15794Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). MMOHα will also cross-link to MMOB (data not shown and Ref. 11Fox B.G. Liu Y. Dege J.E. Lipscomb J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 540-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and MMOD (component D of sMMO) (10Merkx M. Lippard S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5858-5865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). MS Analysis of MMOHα-MMOR-Fd—Initial samples of the MMOHα-MMOR-Fd EDC cross-link product were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. The cross-link involving MMOR-Fd rather than MMOR was chosen for two reasons. The yield of cross-linked material was higher for MMOR-Fd, and it results in fewer peptides after digestion, thus simplifying analysis of the MS data. 76% of MMOHα sequence and 78% of MMOR-Fd sequence was observed in the spectrum. No cross-linked peptides could be conclusively identified, however. Capillary LC/MS was thus employed to separate and analyze the peptide mixture. A sample of the tryptic digest of the MMOHα-MMOR-Fd EDC cross-link product was subjected to LC/MS analysis. The total ion chromatogram is shown in Fig. 2, and sequence coverage statistics are presented in Table I. The origin of MMOHβ peptide fragments in the mass spectrum may be a consequence of protein contamination during SDS-PAGE. Intensities of the MMOHβ peptides were low compared with those of MMOHα or MMOR-Fd. Four major gaps in the MMOHα sequence were responsible for most of the missing residues, namely, residues 95–134, 183–245, 331–360, and 392–419. The large size of these tryptic peptides may have limited the efficiency of their extraction from the gel. In-gel tryptic digestion followed by MALDI-TOF MS analysis of unmodified MMOHα also revealed a sequence gap at residues 183–245 (data not shown).Table ISequence coverage of MMOHα, MMOR-Fd, and MMOHβ in LC/MSProteinNo. of unique peptidesResidues observed/total% coverageMMOHα36359/52668MMOR-Fd1190/9892MMOHβ12126/38832 Open table in a new tab Identification of Cross-linked Peptides—The identity and structures of two cross-linked peptides were confirmed by tandem MS analysis of peaks in the MS spectrum, the mass values of which suggested that they might represent cross-linked peptides (Figs. 3 and 4). These results indicated that, in the presence of EDC, the N-terminal amine of MMOHα forms amide bonds with the carboxylate side chains of MMOR-Fd Glu-56 and Glu-91 (Figs. 3A and 4A). A peptide with [M + 3H]3+m/z 648.4, elutes at 33.5 min. This mass closely matches that predicted for a cross-link between the tryptic peptides MMOR-Fd 52–62 and MMOHα 2–8 3We begin numbering of MMOHα from the initial Met even though it is missing from the mature protein as expressed in M. capsulatus (Bath) (25Buzy A. Millar A.L. Legros V. Wilkins P.C. Dalton H. Jennings K.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Thus, the N-terminal Ala residue is assigned number 2. We use this numbering scheme to be consistent with our previous studies. (Mr calc = 1941.93). The tandem mass spectrum recorded after fragmentation of the triply charged form of this peptide (m/z [M + 3H]3+ 648.4) is shown in Fig. 3B, and the data are presented in Table II. The entire y-ion series is present, and the assignment of Glu-56 of MMOR-Fd (rather than Asp-58 or Asp-60) as the cross-linking site is unambiguous.Fig. 4Structure and tandem mass spectrum of the cross-link between MMOR-Fd Glu-91 and the N terminus of MMOHαA, structure of the cross-link.

MMOR-Fd 88–98 includes three possible sites of cross-linking, Asp-89, Glu-91, and Glu-93, but the tandem mass spectrum unambiguously locates Glu-91 as the only site of cross-link formation (Fig. 4B and Table III).Table IIITandem MS data for peptide with cross-link between MMOR-Fd Glu-91 and MMOHα-N terminusMass (obs.)Mass (calc.)DifferenceErrorStructureIon typeppm2002.0902002.0300.06030TDLE(ALSTATK)IELPYTHPrecursor1785.9141785.950-0.036-20LE(ALSTATK)IELPYTHy91782.8241672.870-0.046-28E(ALSTATK)IELPYTHy81485.8301485.8000.03020TDLE(ALSTATK)IELb71372.7301372.7160.01410TDLE(ALSTATK)IEb61243.8301243.6740.156125TDLE(ALSTATK)Ib51215.6831215.6790.0043TDLE(ALSTATK)Ia51130.5891130.590-0.001-1TDLE(ALSTATK)b4914.583914.5200.06369LE(ALSTATK)y9b4886.539886.5250.01415LE(ALSTATK)y9a4871.433871.440-0.008-9IELPYTHy7773.396773.441-0.045-59E(ALSTATK)y8a4758.366758.3600.0057ELPYTHy6756.394756.415-0.020-27E(ALSTATK)y8a4-NH3740.327740.350-0.024-32ELPYTHy6-H2O690.391690.3900.0011ALSTATKy7α629.317629.320-0.003-4LPYTHy5619.355619.3500.0059LSTATKy6α516.229516.233-0.004-9PYTHy4506.262506.270-0.008-16STATKy5α491.236491.260-0.024-49LSTATy6αb1α419.238419.2380.0000TATKy4α419.238419.180-0.058-138YTHy3329.154329.167-0.006-39TDLb3318.196318.190-0.00420ATKy3α301.170301.172-0.002-12TDLa3256.115256.117-0.002-7THy2247.147247.153-0.006-7TKy2α216.076216.082-0.006-29TDb2188.083188.0890.006-34TDa2155.070155.0700.0000Hy185.09385.0800.013150I/LImmonium73.06473.0470.060104TImmonium Open table in a new tab MMOR-Fd 52–62 and 88–98 were also observed in the LC/MS data as unmodified peptides. Residues 2–8 of MMOHα, however, appeared only as part of a cross-link to segments of MMOR-Fd. These observations are consistent with MMOHα having a single site at the N terminus, which can cross-link to either MMOR-Fd Glu-56 or Glu-91. Examination of the solution structure of MMOR-Fd (7Müller J. Lugovskoy A.A. Wagner G. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 42-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) reveals that Glu-56 and Glu-91 are exposed to solvent and are quite close to one another (Fig. 5A). Glu-56 is located at the end of strand β4, and Glu-91 is located at the beginning of strand β6. The closest carboxylate oxygen atoms to each residue are ∼6 Å from one another. The FAD and NAD(H) binding domains of full-length MMOR are not expected to interfere with cross-linking at Glu-56 and Glu-91, based on comparison to the crystal structure of the analogous iron-sulfur flavoprotein phthalate dioxygenase reductase (26Correll C.C. Batie C.J. Ballou D.P. Ludwig M.L. Science. 1992; 258: 1604-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure analysis of MMOH, the N terminus of the α-subunit is disordered, with Ala-15 being the most N-terminal residue that can be defined (27Rosenzweig A.C. Brandstetter H. Whittington D.A. Nordlund P. Lippard S.J. Frederick C.A. Proteins. 1997; 29: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The remainder of the N terminus is disordered. Fig. 5B shows the structure of MMOH with the position of Ala-15 indicated as a yellow sphere. A previous mass spectrometric investigation of MMOH identified N-terminal variants of MMOHα. In addition to the native form, with Ala-2 at the N terminus, two truncated versions were discovered. One had Lys-8 at the N terminus, and the other had Ala-10 (25Buzy A. Millar A.L. Legros V. Wilkins P.C. Dalton H. Jennings K.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We did not detect these truncates in our preparations of MMOH, and thus, no cross-links to MMOR-Fd involving these truncates were expected or observed. The MMOR EQ2 Mutant—To confirm that the EDC-promoted cross-links between MMOHα and MMOR or MMOR-Fd involve the sites identified, the double mutant MMOR E56Q/E91Q (MMOR EQ2) was prepared. MMOR EQ2 was expected to behave similarly to MMOR in most respects but to lack the ability to form the identified cross-links. Indeed, the UV-visible spectrum of purified MMOR EQ2 is identical to that of MMOR. Similar levels of NADH oxidase activity (Table IV) in the two variants indicate that binding of NADH, reduction and reoxidation of cofactors are not seriously affected by the mutations. Steady-state activity of the sMMO system, however, is impaired with MMOR EQ2.Table IVNADH oxidation activity of sMMO with MMOR or MMOR EQ2MMOH·MMOB·MMORNADH oxidation activity (turnover number)MMORMMOR EQ2Ratioμms-1%0:0:10.1870.161861:2:10.6790.425631:2:20.81"
https://openalex.org/W2039633888,"We previously described enterophilin-1 (Ent-1), a new intestinal protein bearing an extended leucine zipper and a B30.2 domain. Ent-1 expression is associated with growth arrest and enterocyte differentiation. To investigate the importance of Ent-1 in the differentiation, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening. We identified sorting nexin 1 (SNX1) as a novel partner of Ent-1 and confirmed the specificity of interaction by co-immunoprecipitation experiments in mammalian cells. SNX1 is associated with endosomal membranes and triggers the endosome-to-lysosome pathway of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). We observe by immunofluorescence microscopy that Ent-1 and SNX1 are co-localized on vesicular and tubulovesicular structures, which are different from early endosome antigen 1-containing endosomes. By gel filtration chromatography, we show that Ent-1 and SNX1 co-eluted in macromolecular complexes containing part of EGFR. Furthermore, overexpressed Ent-1 decreases cell surface EGFR. Ent-1 and SNX1 co-overexpression strongly extends EGFR diminution, indicating a synergetic effect of both proteins on cell surface EGFR removal. Interestingly, the increase of endogenous Ent-1 expression correlates with the decrease of EGFR during spontaneous differentiation of Caco-2 cells. We thus propose a role of Ent-1 in the trafficking of EGFR to down-regulate intestinal mitogenic signals, highlighting the mechanisms of cell growth arrest associated with enterocytic differentiation."
