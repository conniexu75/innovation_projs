https://openalex.org/W1513843435,"A rapid technique for the determination of the dissociation constant and the number of binding sites of an enzyme-substrate complex has been developed. The method is based on measuring the rate of dialysis of radioactive substrate from an enzyme-substrate equilibrium mixture. Accurate results can be obtained quickly, thus permitting studies with somewhat labile substances."
https://openalex.org/W2007314601,"A mechanical stimulus applied to the anterior part of Paramecium causes a transient increase in membrane permeability to calcium. This permits a calcium current to flow into the cell, causing the membrane potential to approach the equilibrium level for calcium. The transient depolarization which results elicits a reversal in the direction of ciliary beat. When the organisms are free-swimming this is seen as the reversed locomotion of Jennings' ""avoiding reaction."" In contrast, a mechanical stimulus applied to the posterior part results in increased permeability to potassium ions, and hence an outward potassium current. The hyperpolarization which results causes an increase in the frequency of ciliary beat in the normal direction. In free-swimming specimens this is seen as an increase in the velocity of forward locomotion."
https://openalex.org/W1571668808,"Bovine rhodopsin prepared by extraction from retinal outer segments with a nonionic detergent and chromatographic purification on calcium phosphate and ECTEOLA-cellulose migrated electrophoretically as a single band on polyacrylamide gel. The preparation showed spectral ratios of A400:A498 = 0.168 and A280:A498 = 1.75. By amino acid analysis the pigment gave a molecular weight of 28,000 per mole. The 190 and 276 mµ absorption of rhodopsin increased slightly on bleaching. Optical rotatory dispersion and circular dichroism measurements on the highly purified rhodopsin preparation indicate that native rhodopsin possesses approximately 60% helical structure and one-fifth of the helical content is lost on irreversible bleaching. The light-induced conformational change, however, is not observed with outer segments."

https://openalex.org/W1628169521,"Abstract Respiration-inhibited rat liver mitochondria possess two major classes of Ca++-binding sites, which have widely different affinity. At pH 7.4, the low affinity sites can bind about 40 nmoles of Ca++, whereas the high affinity sites bind about 1.2 nmoles of Ca++ per mg of protein and are half-saturated at about 0.025 µm. High affinity Ca++ binding is inhibited by 2,4-dinitrophenol and other uncoupling agents, but is not influenced by the respiratory inhibitors, oligomycin, aurovertin, valinomycin, or gramicidin. Uncoupling agents cause discharge of some of the endogenous Ca++ of mitochondria. No H+ ejection accompanies binding of Ca++ at either the high affinity or low affinity sites if respiration is inhibited. Binding of Ca++ is extremely rapid and apparently temperature-independent. Mn++ and Sr++ are also bound at the high affinity sites, but Mg++ and K+ are not. Aging of the mitochondria caused loss of high affinity Ca++-binding capacity, but not of low affinity binding. Although sonic particles and inner membrane preparations retain the high affinity sites, they are lost in water-lysed mitochondrial ghosts or in mitochondria treated with the nonionic detergent Lubrol WX. The properties of the high affinity Ca++-binding sites suggest they may be contributed either by hypothetical high energy intermediates generated in electron transport or by a specific divalent cation carrier molecule in the membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1601012679,"Abstract Vitamin A deficiency caused a marked decrease in the number of goblet cells in the small intestine of the rat but no other morphological changes were revealed by electron microscopy. RNA and protein concentrations remained unaffected. Large polyribosomes could be isolated from the mucosa after the common bile duct was ligated. No differences were found in polyribosome stability or the protein-synthesizing activity of free polyribosomes from mucosa of vitamin A-deficient or pair fed normal rats. Rough endoplasmic reticulum, on the other hand, showed a decrease in uptake of a labeled amino acid into protein (to less than one-half of the normal level) under conditions of vitamin A deficiency. The lesion was located in the pH 5 fraction by crossing-over experiments, that is, by incubating normal rough endoplasmic reticulum with deficient pH 5 fraction and deficient rough endoplasmic reticulum with normal pH 5 fraction. The mucosal lesion occurs at a very early stage of the deficiency, before the weight plateau stage; however, it was not observable in liver. It is concluded that protein synthesis by membrane-bound but not by free polyribosomes of intestinal mucosa is depressed under conditions of vitamin A deficiency and that the vitamin is therefore involved, directly or indirectly, in protein synthesis at the translational level."
https://openalex.org/W1500632314,"A highly active preparation of human chorionic gonadotropin has been obtained by simple methods of column chromatography on diethylaminoethyl Sephadex and Sephadex G-100. The preparation appeared homogeneous by disc and immunoelectrophoresis, ultracentrifugation, and end group analysis. It assayed at 12,000 i.u. per mg by the rat prostrate gland and accessory sex organ method. The s20, w value was found to be 2.89 S. A molecular weight of 59,000 ± 4,000 was determined by gel filtration on Sephadex G-150. However, the sedimentation equilibrium method gave a value of 47,000 ± 3,000. The molecular weight of the reduced carboxamidomethylated human chorionic gonadotropin, determined by gel filtration, was 30,000 ± 2,000, indicating that human chorionic gonadotropin was probably composed of two polypeptide chains. The minimal molecular weight, computed from the chemical composition, was 27,000. The amino acid and carbohydrate composition of the hormone has been determined."
https://openalex.org/W1591598861,"Abstract Purine nucleoside phosphorylase has been purified about 7,300-fold and crystallized from human erythrocytes (mol wt 81,000). The recrystallized enzyme exists in the form of needles and sometimes bundles of needles and has a specific activity of 96 µm units per mg of protein. A number of phenomena reported earlier for a less pure preparation of this enzyme are still seen with the crystalline enzyme. These include (a) substrate activation by inosine and (b) a constant ratio of reactivity with inosine and deoxyinosine. However, the ribosyl transfer reaction seems markedly decreased with the crystalline preparation. The effect of pH on maximal velocity suggests the occurrence of essential imidazole and sulfhydryl groups, whereas the effect of pH on the Michaelis constant suggests the existence of an essential ionizing group at about pH 7.2 in the free enzyme. Binding studies with hypoxanthine-8-14C indicate that there are at least three binding sites per molecule of enzyme. When the commercially available bovine spleen purine nucleoside phosphorylase was compared with human erythrocytic enzyme, the two enzymes were found to be similar in molecular weight. However, they have different crystal structures and different specific activities, and in contrast to the behavior of the human enzyme, the spleen enzyme did not display the phenomena of substrate activation at high concentrations of inosine."

https://openalex.org/W1496516653,"Abstract Three embryonic hemoglobins are formed in erythroid cells derived from yolk sac blood islands in fetal mice of the C57BL/6J strain. These cells provide a suitable model to study the rates of synthesis of specific proteins during the differentiation of cells. Erythroid cells differentiate initially in yolk sac blood islands from the 8th to the 10th day of gestation. (Fetal mice have a 20- to 21-day period of gestation.) These cells enter the fetal circulation and continue to develop as a relatively homogeneous population until Day 14 or 15, as indicated by a progressive decrease in the size of the nucleus, increasing pycnosis of nuclear chromatin, increasing content of hemoglobin in the cytoplasm, and decreasing content of ribosomes in the cytoplasm. The relative rates of synthesis of the three embryonic hemoglobins, Hb Ei, Hb Eii, and Hb Eiii, change as these erythroid cells differentiate. The synthesis of Hb Ei, the most abundant of the hemoglobins present at Day 10, decreases markedly after Day 11, while the synthesis of Hb Eii proceeds at a relatively linear rate over the entire period and by Day 12 is present in the largest amount. Hb Eiii is formed at a slower rate than Hb Ei or Hb Eii during the entire period from Day 10 to Day 14. Hemoglobin formation in yolk sac erythroid cells is not inhibited by actinomycin D from Day 10, while the antibiotic does inhibit RNA formation and non-heme protein synthesis in these cells. It is suggested that changes in rates of synthesis of the three embryonic hemoglobins which occur as yolk sac erythroid cells develop between Days 10 and 14 may be largely determined by factors regulating protein formation which do not require the immediate or continued synthesis of RNA."

https://openalex.org/W2019577870,"IN a recent interesting communication Barnett1 discusses teaching in man and other mammals. He points out that teaching by punishment is common among animals but believes that the evidence for teaching by encouragement is weak. He further notes that it is difficult to distinguish between “behaviour which promotes learning of skills by imitation, on the one hand, and directed teaching, on the other”, but he does not deal with a third possibility which forms the basis of the educational system of subprimate mammals. This is the creation by the parent of a situation in which the responses of the young automatically lead to their learning."
https://openalex.org/W1585110518,"Abstract Ornithine δ-transaminase activity in the livers of rats, on a commercial diet from 21 days after birth, increased to a maximum at about 35 days of age and decreased thereafter, reaching the 21-day level by about 120 days after birth. Under the same conditions the activity in the kidneys also reached a maximum at about 35 days but did not decline thereafter. One reason for the difference in the shapes of the developmental curves for ornithine δ-transaminase activity for the two organs appeared to depend on different responses to dietary components. The activity in the livers of younger animals was increased by a high nitrogen intake and was decreased by restricting the nitrogen intake. In older animals, high nitrogen intake did not increase ornithine δ-transaminase activity. The activity in kidneys of either young or older rats did not decrease on a restricted nitrogen intake, and the changes in total and specific activities brought about by dietary protein depended on the total food intake. Fasting decreased total ornithine δ-transaminase activity in both liver and kidney, but did not change the specific activities. With carbohydrate as the sole food source, liver activity decreased but kidney activity increased. In experiments with amino acids added to the diet, liver ornithine δ-transaminase activity was decreased by added arginine and increased by arginine deficiency, or increased ingestion of glycine or serine. The activity in kidney was increased by dietary leucine, valine, and isoleucine, all of which are known to inhibit the ornithine δ-transaminase reaction per se and decreased by extra glutamate in the diet. The only response observed in regard to ornithine δ-transaminase which is common to liver and kidney was a significant increase of activity in response to dietary methionine. This methionine-induced increase of activity was apparently not decreased by arginine in the case of liver or by glutamate in the case of kidney. It is speculated that ornithine δ-transaminase may exist in liver and kidney in two different forms, the former functioning in the direction of arginine synthesis and the latter in the direction of arginine metabolism to glutamate."
https://openalex.org/W1603206368,"Abstract Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) was desialyzed by mild acid hydrolysis, reduced with mercaptoethanol, and carboxamidomethylated by iodoacetamide. The resulting alkylated product was subjected to tryptic hydrolysis. Two chromatographically homogeneous glycopeptides were obtained by gel filtration on Sephadex G-50 and ion exchange chromatography on Dowex 1. The carbohydrate composition of these glycopeptides was found to be Fuc1, Gal4, Man5, GluNAc6 and Gal2, Man5, GluNAc5. The sequence of monosaccharides in the carbohydrate chains of these highly complex units was determined by stepwise cleavage of the sugars from the nonreducing ends with specific glycosidases, such as β-galactosidase, β-N-acetylglucosaminidase, α-mannosidase, and α-l-fucosidase. HCG and desialyzed HCG were also studied with these glycosidases and neuraminidase. The carbohydrate chains in the hormone, as shown by this investigation, have the following monosaccharide sequence: N-acetylneuraminic acid [see PDF for sequence], sialic acid or fucose being at the nonreducing ends of the chains. The carbohydrate unit of each of the above glycopeptides was composed of several chains and was probably linked to the polypeptide chains by an N-acetylglucosaminyl-asparagine linkage. Preliminary studies on the alkaline degradation of HCG suggested that all galactosamine residues were linked to the polypeptide chain by N-acetylgalactosaminyl-serine linkages. Based on these studies, the tentative structures of the carbohydrate units have been proposed."

https://openalex.org/W1571925951,"Abstract UDP-galactose pyrophosphorylase (EC 2.7.7.10) has been characterized in human liver and its activity studied at various ages. A new assay method was developed which utilized uniformly labeled 14C-galactose-1-P and rapid chromatographic separation of the 14C-UDP-galactose formed on diethylaminoethyl cellulose paper. Enzyme activity is enhanced 2-fold by the sulfhydryl reagent, dithioerythritol. Magnesium is an absolute requirement for enzyme activity but the enzyme is inhibited by high magnesium concentrations. Michaelis constants were 0.8 x 10-3 m for UTP and 1.8 x 10-3 m for galactose-1-P. Inhibition of enzyme activity was observed by high levels of UTP; this inhibition was reversible by increasing the concentration of galactose-1-P. In contrast to earlier studies of the rat hepatic enzyme, this enzyme activity in human liver changes little from the newborn period to old age. The ability of this enzyme to metabolize galactose-1-P in human liver is probably not more than 1.0% the activity of galactose 1-phosphate uridyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.12)."
https://openalex.org/W1491207315,"Abstract Combination of apocytochrome c peroxidase with various porphyrins such as proto-, hemato-, meso-, and deuteroporphyrins IX was investigated. These porphyrins combined with the apoprotein with a molar stoichiometry of 1:1 to form well defined porphyrin-protein complexes. The complexes were further purified by chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose columns and crystallized by dialysis against distilled water. Spectrophotometric studies of the kinetics of the interaction of the apoenzyme with porphyrins indicated that their reactions were composed of at least two steps, a fast reaction followed by a slow reaction: the former appeared to be a chemical binding of porphyrins to the apoenzyme and the latter a conformational change of the protein moiety caused by the porphyrin binding. The molecular weight and isoelectric point of the protoporphyrin-apoenzyme complex were determined as 4 x 104 and pH 5.45, respectively. The porphyrin-apocytochrome c peroxidase complexes were found neither to form distinct peroxide compounds in reaction with hydroperoxide nor to show the peroxidase activity. Comparison of these porphyrin-protein complexes with natural and synthetic cytochrome c peroxidases indicated that the iron atom in the prosthetic group is needed for the peroxidase activity but not for the binding of the prosthetic group to the apoenzyme. Light absorption, fluorescence spectra, and heat stability curves of the porphyrin-protein complexes were compared with those of the apoenzyme and natural holoenzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1541561972,"Abstract The (+) isomer of β-methylcholine and phosphoryl-β-methylcholine is present in the phosphatidyl-β-methylcholine of housefly larvae that have been reared in the presence of any one of the following phosphatidyl-β-methylcholine precursors: (+) carnitine, (-) carnitine, dl-β-methylcholine, γ-butyrobetaine, or trimethylaminoacetone. The conversion of both (+) and (-) carnitine to (+) β-methylcholine shows that the hydroxyl group of carnitine or a metabolite of carnitine is epimerized by larvae. The larvae do not convert crotonylbetaine to β-methylcholine, establishing that free crotonylbetaine is not an intermediate in the conversion of γ-butyrobetaine to carnitine. The major larval metabolites of γ-butyrobetaine are phosphatidyl-β-methylcholine, phosphoryl-β-methylcholine, and carnitine. The major metabolites of carnitine are phosphatidyl-β-methylcholine and phosphoryl-β-methylcholine. Phosphatidyl-β-methylcholine is converted to glycerophosphoryl-β-methylcholine, a compound that can be metabolized by larvae. The major 32P-containing material obtained by the action of a 40,000 x g larval supernatant on 32P-labeled glycerophosphoryl-β-methylcholine is glycerophosphate (g80% conversion); however, a minimum of four other compounds were detected, including Pi. Such results are consistent with the concept that larvae synthesize and degrade phosphatidyl-β-methylcholine in a manner analogous to the synthesis and degradation of phosphatidylcholine."
https://openalex.org/W1484693377,"Abstract The requirement for Na+ for the uptake of α-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB) by cells of a marine pseudomonad was found to be quantitatively similar to the requirement for Na+ to prevent the release of AIB from previously loaded cells of the organism. At concentrations of Na+ different from the optimum, the viability of cells decreased in proportion to the extent of loss of AIB from previously loaded cells. AIB loss, however, preceded the loss of viability. The uptake of AIB required Na+ specifically while retention could be at least partially effected by other ions, particularly Li+. As the Na+ concentration in the suspending medium increased from 0 to 50 mm, the Km for transport decreased 12-fold while Vmax remained essentially constant. Between 50 and 200 mm Na+, Km remained constant at 8.33 x 10-5 m while Vmax continued to increase. Up to 200 mm Na+ the rate of uptake of AIB and the capacity of the cells for AIB were a direct function of the Na+ concentration or of the Li+ concentration if Na+ was present. Above 200mm Na+ the capacity of the cells for AIB decreased. Na+ could not be replaced by Li+ or K+ in effecting exchange diffusion of unlabeled AIB in the suspending medium with AIB-14C in the cells. Cells suspended at pH 7.2 in a medium containing NaCl or LiCl at a concentration optimum for retention of AIB lost AIB in the presence of NaCl but not LiCl when treated with 2,4-dinitrophenol or KCN. At pH 5.3 dinitrophenol caused the loss of AIB from the cells in the presence of either salt. The results suggest that there are two functions of Na+ in these cells, one concerned with uptake of compounds and the other involved in the prevention of their release."

https://openalex.org/W1480303334,"Abstract Temperature dependence studies, at a slightly acid pH, on the competitive water analogue inhibitors of α-chymotrypsin show that complex formation is independent of temperature and that binding is primarily entropy-driven. The inhibitors of this type studied here were tertiary amyl alcohol and 3-pentanone. In addition, studies on another class of inhibitor are presented. These competitive inhibitors consist of a benzene ring with different functional groups attached. The compounds are benzene, toluene, benzyl alcohol, benzaldehyde, and benzoate ion. Such inhibitors are similar to the substrate methyl hippurate in that the ΔH0 values for complex formation are quite negative while ΔS0 values may range from slightly positive to quite negative. Compounds of this type give rise to very large negative values for the change in heat capacity, ΔCp, for the complex-forming step, suggesting that considerable conformational change takes place in the enzyme during the process. This is in striking contrast to the first mentioned water analogue inhibitors where ΔCp is equal to zero. In addition it is shown that ΔCp for the formation of the ES complex from diethylglutarate which does not contain an aromatic nucleus is also very close to zero; this implies that the proposed conformational change brought about by the aromatic substrates and inhibitors does not take place in the absence of an aromatic ring, and suggests that a charge transfer complex may be involved in triggering the aforementioned conformational change. Examples are produced to show that comparison of association constants at a single temperature can be very misleading. Evidence is presented which indicates that there is no charge neutralization when complex formation with an anion such as benzoate takes place, but that there is a truly enormous change in heat capacity. It is suggested that the aliphatic alcohol and ketone may well bind at a slightly different site or portion of the enzyme than that with which the aromatic inhibitors combine. It is further proposed that both of these sites may be used to help bind a substrate such as methyl hippurate by means of a two-point hydrophobic attachment. The hydrophobic binding of the aromatic portion of the substrate molecule is probably exothermic, while the binding of the aliphatic portion of the alcohol component may not make a significant contribution to the enthalpy change. The ratio of inhibitor to enzyme in the enzyme-inhibitor complex is unity for all types of inhibitors studied."

https://openalex.org/W2009744100,"IT has been shown that radiation-sensitive mutants in separate genes, which presumably affect different steps in the repair of damaged DNA, can complement in Escherichia coli1, or yeast2 and Ustilago diploids. Could such strains complement each other's deficiencies in heterokaryotic cell ? Such complementation would not be expected if the repair mechanism was completely confined to the nucleus. Recently, mutants of Neurospora two or three times more sensitive to the lethal effect of ultraviolet light than wild type have been reported to complement in heterokaryons3. We have tested this further with three radiation sensitive (uvs) mutants of Ustilago maydis which are 10–30 times more sensitive to ultraviolet light than wild type cells, and which are believed to be deficient in ability to repair damaged DNA4. These mutants are recessive, unlinked and complement in diploid cells. Heterokaryotic cells were obtained using the conditions devised by Puhalla5 which allow strains of opposite mating type to fuse to form hyphal cells containing nuclei of opposite mating type, although we used a different medium (Ustilago liquid complete medium supplemented with 1.7 per cent Difco cornmeal agar). Groups of heterokaryotic cells were removed with a needle from compatible matings between strains with like or different uvs mutations, and spread on a plate of complete medium. The plate was irradiated with 960 ergs/mm2 ultraviolet light from a standard germicidal lamp. This dose kills about 20 per cent of wild type cells and at least 98 per cent of uvs cells. After overnight incubation, 150 heterokaryotic cells of each type were scored for viability under a low power microscope. On this medium viable heterokaryons grow to form a microcolony consisting largely of haploid cells. The parent strains each carry complementing auxotrophic markers, and so it is easy to show that the surviving colonies are not diploids by replica plating them to unsupplemented medium on which only diploids will grow. The results of the tests are shown in Table 1."
