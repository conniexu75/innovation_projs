https://openalex.org/W2074775821,"Rats with one- or two-stage lesions in the hippocampus, anzygdala, or frontal cortex were tested on a variety of tasks. Even though locus and amount of tissue damage were very similar in the two groups, animals with one-stage lesions were impaired as judged by performance on all problems, while aninmals with two-stage lesionis were not."

https://openalex.org/W2022912989,Apparatus designed to measure absorption of ammonia from the air by aqueous surfaces was installed near several cattle feedlots and in appropriate control areas. Ammonia absorption rates measured near feedlots were as much as 20 times greater than near the control. Their magnitudes indicate that absorption of ammonia volatilized from cattle feedlots contributes significantly to the nitrogen enrichment of surface water in the vicinity of feedlots.

https://openalex.org/W2078970226,A study of the effects of ouabain and propranolol on the spontaneous activity in the preganglionic sympathetic nerves to the cat heart showed that ouabain can produce both an inhibition and a stimulation of the spontaneous activity in sympathetic nerves. The inhibition appears to be reflex in nature and is not present when the buffer nerves are sectioned. The stimulation is correlated with the development of cardiac arrhythmias and is antagonized by propranolol.

Retention was unimpaired, however, when the electroconvulsive shock treatment was given 1 day after training immediately after the presentation of the stimulus used in the fear conditioning training. These results support the view that electroconvulsive shock disrupts memory trace consolidation but does not disrupt a recently reactivated memory trace."

https://openalex.org/W2031726998,"A calcium salt given by stomach tube in modest amounts, such as might be ingested in a normal meal, produced hypercalcemia in acutely thyroidectomized fasted rats, whereas in rats with intact thyroid glands the same dose of calcium had little or no detectable effect, presumably because of release of thyrocalcitonin. Thyrocalcitonin apparently protects against hypercalcemia during feeding after deprivation."

https://openalex.org/W2076555014,"THE ability of a variety of alkylating chemicals to produce infertility in male animals has long been established1 and investigations have shown that many such compounds are capable of alkylating genetic materials2. Their mutagenic effects in insects3 and the induction of dominant lethal mutations in experimental rodents4,5 are presumably the result of such interactions."

https://openalex.org/W2072933420,Contractures induced by KCl are produced in cat ventricular muscle after depletion of catecholamine stores by previous treatment with reserpine or by selective blocking of adrenergic receptor sites with propranalol. Contractures are reproducible for 2 to 3 hours and are markedly depressed by the addition of epinephrine. The relaxation of contracture induced by epinephrine parallels the eftect of this compound of shortening the duration of the normal twitch. The failure of the normal mammalian myocardium to maintain tension in solutions of high KCI concentration appears to be related to the endogenous amounts of catecholamines in the tissue.

https://openalex.org/W2012189549,"Mild alkaline treatment induces the formation of a specific RNA complex inside turnip yellow mosaic virus. Dialysis at pH 4.5 destroys this complex inside the capsid, but does not destroy complexes that have been removed from their capsids. These facts were interpreted in terms of a breakage and subsequent re-formation of RNA-protein links. In combination with supporting potentiometric data, they suggest histidinyl-phosphate salt links or carboxylate-amino hydrogen bonds, or both, as the principal means of association of turnip yellow mosaic virus protein and RNA."

https://openalex.org/W1490601639,"Abstract An acid ribonuclease from lymphosarcoma P1798 has been purified about 1000-fold. The purified protein can be resolved into two bands by analytical acrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme is an endonuclease, splitting polyuridylic acid into oligonucleotides of chain length 7 or less with a cyclic 2',3'-end group. The physical and chemical properties of this enzyme are similar to but not identical with hog spleen acid ribonuclease."

https://openalex.org/W4232027348,"Bolin and Davis1 have reported a lactase deficiency in non-Caucasians. There is an increasing interest in lactase and it could be important to have our baselines correct. Western communities now live on comparatively high protein diets. We tend to think that we are meat eaters, but in fact the figures published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in 1966 illustrate that a large proportion of our animal protein comes from milk (Table 1). Although some African minority groups use milk as adults, most non-Caucasians use insignificant amounts, relying largely on cereals or fish. They will, however, drink their mothers' milk for perhaps the first 9â€“24 months of life and presumably have adequate lactase during this period."
