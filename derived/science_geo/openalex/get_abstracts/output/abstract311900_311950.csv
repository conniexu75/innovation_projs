https://openalex.org/W1979868326,"We examined the circumstances of death and injury among victims of the tornado that struck Wichita Falls, Texas, on 10 April 1979. We also assessed the protective measures taken by a representative sample of community residents who suffered no major injury in order to estimate the relative risk of injury to people directly in the tornado's path. Twenty-six (60 percent) of the 43 traumatic deaths and 30 (51 percent) of the 59 serious injuries occurred in people who, despite ample warning, went to their cars to drive out of the storm's path. These people had a risk of serious or fatal injury of 23 per 1000. People who remained indoors and in stationary homes were at relatively low risk (3 per 1000) if they took simple precautions; people in mobile homes were at greatest risk (85 per 1000). Current safety recommendations and housing codes for single family homes and mobile homes need to be amended to decrease the impact of future tornadoes on human health."

https://openalex.org/W2030979024,"Human occupation of New Guinea had begun 50,000 years ago, but islands further east were settled only in Recent times. In part of the New Guinea highlands, wet and dry horticultural systems began by 9000 years ago. Local intensification is evident until the present, but only the most recent major crop (sweet potato, which has been grown in the region for less than 300 years) is documented. On the south coast, exchange systems and economies locally diversify over the last two millennia. In the Melanesian islands, exotic materials were moved 3000 kilometers 3000 years ago, but whether traders or colonists were involved is not yet clear. The prehistory of the area is proving more complex than was believed even a decade ago."

https://openalex.org/W2083984001,"There is evidence that the golden hamster (Cricetus auratus) is the animal of choice for the isolation of leptospirae, especially of the Leptospira canicola type since young guinea pigs and mice are resistant to infection and rats are entirely refractory. Both the classical strain, L. icterohaemorrhagiae and L. canicola on isolation have been found to produce a fatal infection in hamsters. The present report deals with the isolation of L. canicola in two instances by the injection intraperitoneally into hamsters of urine obtained from dogs ill with suspected leptospirosis. Each of the dogs was apparently the source of infection for a human case of Canicola leptospirosis. The classical strain L. icterohaemorrhagiae was isolated from the dog for the first time in the United States. In this instance the organism was isolated by injecting both whole blood and urine from the patient intraperitoneally into young hamsters. The injection into hamsters of suitable material from patients infected with L. canicola and L. icterohaemorrhagiae is followed by a fatal leptospirosis in the test animal."

Although the renewable resources in principle have unlimited potential, it is not clear that they can make a major contribution to electricity expansion within the 20th century. Coal and nuclear power are the practical alternatives. The adverse effects of nuclear power probably remain less than those of coal, despite the impact of the Three Mile Island accident. It is important to explore and exploit all options, especially the endangered nuclear option."

The library report of April, 1939 listed a total of over fifty thousand volumes, and the rooms contained DALTON'S manuscripts and apparatus, JOULE'S chronometer, and portraits of NEWTON, DAVY, DALTON, JOULE, PERCIVAL and other distinguished men who have been associated with the Society.2 The Society, one of the earliest of its kind outside London, was founded in 1781, largely through the activities of THOMAS PERCIVAL. The early history is linked with that of the Warrington Academy (1757-1784),5 for PERCIVAL was a pupil at the school and came under the influence of PRIESTLEY. It is not surprising therefore that when the school was compelled to close its doors, its supporters turned to Manchester, where PERCIVAL'S Literary and Philosophical Society was creating an atmosphere of intellectual curiosity unknown elsewhere in provincial England. The new Manchester Academy remained in the town for several years, but after much wandering finally settled in Oxford as Manchester College. The Literary and Philosophical Society remained in Manchester, continuing to stimulate thought and discussion, and giving rise to continual demands for provincial university education, which culminated in the founding of Owen's College in 1851, and finally in the Victoria University Charter in 1880. THOMAS PERCIVAL, the Father of the Society, and author of the greatest book on medical ethics in the English language,t was born in 1740, in Warrington, the son of JOSEPH PERCIVAL, a merchant. THOMAS was at one time a student at the Manchester Grammar School and later a pupil at the Warrington Academy. He studied medicine in Edinburgh, and in 1765 went"
