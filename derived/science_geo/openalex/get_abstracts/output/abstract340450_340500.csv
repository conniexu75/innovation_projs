https://openalex.org/W2035279439,"Everyday observation reveals that both individuals and organizations often become overly committed to losing courses of action; in a sense, throwing good money after bad. More than 10 years of research on this escalation problem shows that persistence is associated with at least four major clases of determinants: project, psychological, social, and organizational variables. The influence of these four sets of variables evolves over time, forming a dynamic model of behavior in escalation situations."
https://openalex.org/W2092216315,"Cambrian arthropods are now well known, but there has been little agreement on how they contribute to an understanding of arthropod phylogeny. Fossils have either been lumped together as ""trilobitomorphs"" or, more recently, have been the subject of speculation invoking a multiple polyphyletic origin of arthropods. Cladistic analysis of characters of Cambrian and living representatives (excluding Uniramia) shows that trilobites and chelicerates are relatively advanced compared with ""crustaceans,"" and there are doubts whether the latter constitute a national group. An undue emphasis on singular autapomorphies of problematic fossils has obscured these relationships in the past. ""Trilobitomorphs"" were simply an artificial taxon based on shared primitive characters. The arthropods that evolved during the Cambrian radiation show no more apparent morphological diversity than do the living groups. The evidence of wellpreserved problematica is critical to understanding the nature of this radiation and the affinities of the groups that remain today."
https://openalex.org/W1996606122,"Problems involving physiochemical phenomena on both the microscopic and macroscopic scales often raise similar sets of generic issues and questions. The complexity of these problems is beginning to make inoperative the traditional intuition-based approaches to their analysis and solution. The common characteristics of large, multivariable, complex molecular systems call for a new, more systematic approach to guide theoretical and experimental efforts. With mathematical modeling becoming an essential ingredient in the studies, it is argued that molecular systems analysis and especially the systematic tools of sensitivity analyis can play an increasingly important role in understanding and finding solutions to complex, chemically based problems."
https://openalex.org/W1983435928,"Certain genes of Nectria haematococca, a fungal pathogen of pea (Pisum sativum), encode pisatin demethylase (pda), a cytochrome P-450 monoxygenase that detoxifies the phytoalexin pisatin. Because pda is required by N. haematococca for pathogenicity on pea, pisatin helps defend pea against N. haematococca. The possibility that pisatin is a general defense factor—that is, that pda can confer pathogenicity to fungi not normally pathogenic on pea—was investigated. Genes encoding pda were transformed into and highly expressed in Cochliobolus heterostrophus, a fungal pathogen of maize but not of pea, and in Aspergillus nidulans, a saprophytic fungus, neither of which produces a significant amount of pda. Transformants contained at least as much pda as did wild-type N. haematococca. Recombinant C. heterostrophus was normally virulent on maize, but it also caused symptoms on pea, whereas recombinant A. nidulans did not affect pea. Thus, phytoalexins can function in nonspecific resistance of plants to microbes; saprophytes appear to lack genes for basic pathogenicity."
https://openalex.org/W2035572164,"A series of archeomagnetic measurements have been carried out on archeologic materials from Arizona and Mexico which can be compared with results from Europe and Asia. This comparison shows a westward drift of geomagnetic intensity at a rate of about 0.24 degree per year. Furthermore, an apparent coincidence between changes in the earth's magnetic moment and changes in the production rate of radiocarbon is observed."
https://openalex.org/W2141291391,"Refraction measurements made in the deep ocean between the Marshall and Hawaiian islands reveal a layer of seismic velocity 7.3 kilometers per second between the 6.8 kilometer per second oceanic crustal layer and the mantle. This layer, normally masked as a second arrival, is revealed by continuous air gun refraction data. The layer may be widespread in the deep oceans."

Although bimodal distributions of drop size shift to smaller diameters with increasing electrification for both liquids, the lower surface tension of the alcohol promotes the formation of secondary jets and a fan configuration not observed for water."

https://openalex.org/W1974730745,"Excavations at Altun Ha, British Honduras (Belize), have yielded a claw-shaped bead of tumbaga, a gold-copper alloy, occurring as part of an Early Classic offering. Stratigraphic evidence plus radiocarbon dates place the cache at or before A.D. 500, and stylistic elements indicate a source for the bead in the Coclé culture of central Panama."
https://openalex.org/W1990928161,"An attempt to produce polywater in a corona discharge in moist air was unsuccessful. However, the major product produced, nitric acid, has a midrange infrared spectrum which is strikingly similar to that reported for polywater. The Raman spectrum offers a better means of distinguishing between nitric acid and polywater than the infrared spectrum does."

https://openalex.org/W2062826049,"The weevil Smicronyx quadrifer (broad sense) is restricted in host preference to the parasitic dodders (Cuscuta species) during its adult life, but its larvae consistently move from dodder stems into living stems of certain hosts of dodders, where they feed, grow to maturity, and undergo metamorphosis. Such associations, involving three interacting organisms, are very unusual among phytophagous insects."
