https://openalex.org/W2079440628,"A family of genes including ETR1, ETR2, EIN4, ERS1, and ERS2 is implicated in ethylene perception in Arabidopsis thaliana. As only dominant mutations were previously available for these genes, it was unclear whether all of them are components in the ethylene signaling pathway and whether they code for positive or negative regulators of ethylene responses. In this study, we have isolated loss-of-function mutations of four of these genes (ETR1, ETR2, EIN4, and ERS2) and identified an ethylene-independent role of ETR1 in promoting cell elongation. Quadruple mutants had constitutive ethylene responses, revealing that these proteins negatively regulate ethylene responses and that the induction of ethylene response in Arabidopsis is through inactivation rather than activation of these proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2063639010,"In this study, we show that oligodendrocyte differentiation is powerfully inhibited by activation of the Notch pathway. Oligodendrocytes and their precursors in the developing rat optic nerve express Notch1 receptors and, at the same time, retinal ganglion cells express Jagged1, a ligand of the Notch1 receptor, along their axons. Jagged1 expression is developmentally regulated, decreasing with a time course that parallels myelination in the optic nerve. These results suggest that the timing of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination is controlled by the Notch pathway and raise the question of whether localization of myelination is controlled by this pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2037048003,"Stem cells are thought to occupy special local environments, or niches, established by neighboring cells that give them the capability for self-renewal. Each ovariole in the Drosophila ovary contains two germline stem cells surrounded by a group of differentiated somatic cells that express hedgehog and wingless. Here we show that the BMP2/4 homolog decapentaplegic (dpp) is specifically required to maintain female germline stem cells and promote their division. Overexpression of dpp blocks germline stem cell differentiation. Conversely, mutations in dpp or its receptor (saxophone) accelerate stem cell loss and retard stem cell division. We constructed mutant germline stem cell clones to show that the dpp signal is directly received by germline stem cells. Thus, dpp signaling helps define a niche that controls germline stem cell proliferation."

https://openalex.org/W2150094887,"Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is a distant member of the TGFbeta protein family that is essential for neuronal survival and renal morphogenesis. We show that mice who are deficient in the glycosyl-phosphatidyl inositol (GPI) -linked protein GFRalpha1 (GDNFRalpha) display deficits in the kidneys, the enteric nervous system, and spinal motor and sensory neurons that are strikingly similar to those of the GDNF- and Ret-deficient mice. GFRalpha1-deficient dopaminergic and nodose sensory ganglia neurons no longer respond to GDNF or to the structurally related protein neurturin (NTN) but can be rescued when exposed to GDNF or neurturin in the presence of soluble GFRalpha1. In contrast, GFRalpha1-deficient submandibular parasympathetic neurons retain normal response to these two factors. Taken together with the available genetic and biochemical data, these findings support the idea that GFRalpha1 and the transmembrane tyrosine kinase Ret are both necessary receptor components for GDNF in the developing kidney and nervous system, and that GDNF and neurturin can mediate some of their activities through a second receptor."

https://openalex.org/W2010435020,The adaptor protein SLP-76 is expressed in T lymphocytes and myeloid cells and is a substrate for ZAP-70 and Syk. We generated a SLP-76 null mutation in mice by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells to evaluate the role of SLP-76 in T cell development and activation. SLP-76-deficient mice exhibited subcutaneous and intraperitoneal hemorrhaging and impaired viability. Analysis of lymphoid cells revealed a profound block in thymic development with absence of double-positive CD4+8+ thymocytes and of peripheral T cells. This block could not be overcome by in vivo treatment with anti-CD3. V-D-J rearrangement of the TCRβ locus was not obviously affected. B cell development was normal. These results indicate that SLP-76 collects all pre-TCR signals that drive the development and expansion of double-positive thymocytes.

https://openalex.org/W2035299191,"Anteroposterior (AP) patterning in the vertebrate hindbrain is dependent upon the establishment of segmental domains of Hox expression. We investigated the mechanism that governs the early expression of Hoxb4 and found that transient signaling from the paraxial mesoderm induces expression in the hindbrain. Induction involves a retinoid pathway requiring retinoic acid receptor (RAR) function within the neural plate. Characterization of a prerhombomeric enhancer from Hoxb4 reveals that a retinoic acid (RA) response element is an essential component of the early neural response to somite (s) signaling and can interpret positional information for setting the anterior boundary of expression. These data suggest a mechanism whereby, during normal hindbrain development, Hoxb4 expression is initiated by extrinsic signals and is subsequently maintained by Hox feedback circuits. This mechanism also accounts for the ectopic response of Hoxb4 in rhombomere (r) transpositions and after exposure to retinoids."

https://openalex.org/W1990761413,"Proteolysis by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is often regulated, but the mechanisms underlying such regulation remain ill-defined. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, cell type is controlled by the MAT transcription factors. The α2 repressor is a known ubiquitin pathway substrate in α haploid cells. We show that a1 is rapidly degraded in a haploids. In a/α diploids, α2 and a1 are stabilized by heterodimerization. Association depends on N-terminal coiled-coil interactions between a1 and α2. Residues in α2 important for these interactions overlap a critical determinant of an α2 degradation signal, which we delimit by extensive mutagenesis. Our data provide a detailed description of a natural ubiquitin-dependent degradation signal and point to a molecular mechanism for regulated turnover in which proteolytic signals are differentially masked in alternative multiprotein complexes."

https://openalex.org/W1993760399,"A putative tumor suppressor, PTEN/MMAC1 gene at 10q23 was recently identified and found to be mutated in many different human tumors. To determine the role of the PTEN/MMAC1 gene in lung cancer, we screened 34 small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines, 10 SCLC tumors, 13 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines and 10 NSCLC tumors using Denaturing HPLC (DHPLC) and direct sequencing methods. In SCLC, six (18%) of the cell lines and one of the primary tumor samples (10%) showed alterations of the PTEN/MMAC1 gene including point mutations, small fragment deletions, and homozygous deletions. All of the point mutations and small fragment deletions were observed in hemizygously deleted cell lines. In contrast to SCLC, none of the NSCLC tumors or cell lines had mutations in the PTEN/MMAC1 gene. These data indicate that PTEN/MMAC1 mutations contribute to the pathogenesis and neoplastic evolution in SCLC but not in NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W2142365954,"Determination of the crystal structure of the human TBP-associated factor (hTAFII)28/hTAFII18 heterodimer shows that these TAFIIs form a novel histone-like pair in the TFIID complex. The histone folds in hTAFII28 and hTAFII18 were not predicted from their primary sequence, indicating that these TAFIIs define a novel family of atypical histone fold sequences. The TAFII18 and TAFII28 histone fold motifs are also present in the N- and C-terminal regions of the SPT3 proteins, suggesting that the histone fold in SPT3 may be reconstituted by intramolecular rather than classical intermolecular interactions. The existence of additional histone-like pairs in both the TFIID and SAGA complexes shows that the histone fold is a more commonly used motif for mediating TAF–TAF interactions than previously believed."

https://openalex.org/W170625709,"Vertebrate neurogenesis is initiated by the organizer factors that inhibit antineuralizing activities of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) in the ectoderm. Here, we report a candidate mediator of neuralization, SoxD. Expression of SoxD starts at late blastula stages widely in the prospective ectoderm and becomes restricted to the dorsal ectoderm by mid-gastrula stages. SoxD expression is enhanced by the neural inducer Chordin and is suppressed by BMP4 and its downstream genes. Microinjection of SoxD mRNA causes ectopic formation of neural tissues in vivo and induces neural and neuronal markers in the isolated animal cap. Injection of a dominant-negative form of SoxD mRNA can block neuralization of ectoderm caused by attenuation of BMP signals and can strongly suppress formation of anterior neural tissues in vivo. These data show that SoxD functions as an essential mediator of downstream signaling of neural induction."
https://openalex.org/W2328242170,"Overexpression of the high mobility group I (HMGI) proteins is often associated with the malignant phenotype. Moreover, many benign human tumors, mainly of mesenchymal origin, are characterized by rearrangements of the HMGI-C gene. In most cases, HMGI-C alterations involve breaks within the third intron of the gene resulting in aberrant transcripts carrying exons from 1–3, which encode the three DNA binding domains, fused to ectopic sequences. Here, we show that the expression of a truncated form of HMGI-C protein carrying only the three DNA-binding domains, or of a fusion protein carrying the three DNA-binding domains of HMGI-C and the LIM domains of the lipoma preferred partner gene (LPP) protein, causes malignant transformation of NIH3T3 cells. The unrearranged wild-type HMGI-C cDNA did not exert any transforming activity. These findings indicate that rearranged forms of HMGI-C play a role in cell transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2329080279,"The rodent S100-related calcium-binding protein, S100A4 induces metastasis in non-metastatic rat and mouse benign mammary cells and co-operates with benign-tumour-inducing changes in two transgenic mouse models, to yield metastatic mammary tumours. Co-transfection of the human gene for S100A4 with pSV2neo into the benign rat mammary cell line, Rama 37, yielded cells which expressed a low level of the endogenous S100A4 mRNA, and either high or undetectable levels of human S100A4 mRNA. The cells which expressed a high level of human S100A4 mRNA induced metastasis in the benign rat mammary cell line Rama 37 in an in vivo assay, whereas the cells which expressed an undetectable level of human S100A4 did not induce any detectable metastases. The primary tumours arising from the S100A4-expressing cells contained high levels of immunocytochemically-detected S100A4 and this high level of S100A4 and the metastatic potential were maintained when cells from a metastasis were re-injected into syngeneic rats. The results show that the human S100A4 possesses metastasis-inducing capabilities."
https://openalex.org/W2314995980,"In this study, critical signaling pathway required for the stretch induced morphological changes of human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs) was investigated. Uni-axial cyclic stretch (1 Hz, 20% in length) of the cells cultured on an elastic silicon membrane induced a gradual morphological change in the cells from a polygonal shape to an elongated spindle-like shape whose long axis was aligned perpendicular to the stretch axis. We found that protein tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins increased and peaked at 20 min in response to cyclic stretch. Either treatment of cells with gadolinium (Gd3+), a potent blocker for stretch-activated channels, or removal of extracellular Ca2+ blocked the tyrosine phosphorylation of the proteins, suggesting that stretch-activated (SA) ion channels regulated stretch specific tyrosine phosphorylation. The major phosphorylated proteins had molecular masses of approximately 120–135 kDa, and 70 kDa. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that paxillin, focal adhesion kinase (pp125FAK) and pp130CAS were included in the 70 kDa and 120–135 kDa bands, respectively. The morphological change was inhibited by herbimycin A and genistein, inhibitors of tyrosine kinases, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation was required for the morphological change. In addition, the kinase activation of pp125FAK was observed in response to cyclic stretch. Moreover, suppression of pp125FAK expression by the antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides (S-ODN) in HUVECs resulted in inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin and the stretch-dependent morphological changes. These results suggest that an activation of tyrosine kinase(s) by an increase in intracellular Ca2+ and pp125FAK play a critical role in the unique morphological change specifically observed in endothelial cells subjected to uni-axial cyclic stretch."
https://openalex.org/W1991703712,"Gestational trophoblastic diseases comprise a spectrum of interrelated diseases including partial mole, complete mole and gestational choriocarcinoma. Using reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) analysis, we identified higher levels of DOC-2/hDab2 expression in the normal trophoblast cells in culture than in choriocarcinoma cell lines. Subsequent study using immunohistochemistry showed high levels of DOC-2/hDab2 protein expression in normal trophoblast tissues but significantly lower levels of expression in gestational trophoblastic disease tissues, particularly in complete mole and choriocarcinoma. When DOC-2/hDab2 was transfected into the choriocarcinoma cell lines, Jar, JEG and BeWo, the stable transfectants showed significantly reduced growth rate in culture. These data suggest that down regulation of DOC-2/hDab2 may play an important role in the development of gestational trophoblastic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1665004120,"The relay of information through thalamus to cortex is dynamically gated, as illustrated by the retinogeniculocortical pathway. Important to this is the inhibitory interneuron in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). For the typical neuron, synaptic information arrives through postsynaptic dendrites and is transmitted by axon terminals. However, the typical thalamic interneuron, in addition to conventional axonal outputs, has distal dendrites that serve both pre- and postsynaptic roles. These dendritic terminals participate in curious and enigmatic triadic arrangements, in which each contacts a relay cell dendrite and is contacted by a glutamatergic retinal terminal that innervates the same relay cell dendrite. Here we show that agonists of the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) activate dendritic terminals of interneurons in the absence of action potentials, thereby inhibiting the postsynaptic relay neuron. Somatic recordings from LGN interneurons reveal that there is no response to mGluR agonists, suggesting that their dendritic terminals are electrically isolated from their somata and axons, consistent with anatomical modelling of these cells. Our results offer insight into the functioning of triadic circuitry and indicate that thalamic interneurons can perform independent computations expressed through axonal as opposed to dendritic outputs."

https://openalex.org/W2334157097,"c-erbB-2, a member of the tyrosine kinase oncogene family, is overexpressed in about 30% of human breast tumors where it correlates with poor prognosis. In vitro studies have suggested that increased expression of the receptor plays an important role in malignant progression. To better understand the direct effects of p185HER2 overexpression, a human c-erbB-2 expression vector was transfected into the hormone-dependent MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cell line and cell growth was analysed. Unexpectedly, colony formation assay revealed a reduction in the number and size of colonies as compared with mock-transfected cells. In hormone-deprived medium, c-erbB-2 transfected cells acquired growth capability, consistent with previous reports. By contrast, two c-erbB-2-transfected clones grown in complete medium showed a reduced proliferation rate despite the activation of a fully functional oncoprotein capable of autophosphorylation and induction of the MAPK pathway. The number of c-erbB-2-overexpressing cells in the S phase of the cell cycle was about one-half the number of control and mock-transfected cells. Also, overexpression of c-erbB-2 induced overexpression of p21WAF1, pRB hypophosphorylation and a mature differentiated cell phenotype with production of lipid droplets. Functional inactivation of p185HER2 by means of a specific single chain antibody indicated the c-erbB-2-dependence of the observed alterations. These data show that the exogenous overexpression of the c-erbB-2 gene in hormone-dependent breast cancer cells inhibits proliferation and induces differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W2318605144,"Elk-1, an ets related gene codes for at least two splice variants Elk-1, which regulates c-fos transcription and deltaElk-1, both of which function as transcriptional activators. To investigate the role of Elk-1 and deltaElk-1 proteins in apoptosis; we have developed rat fibroblast cell lines and human breast cancer cell lines expressing Elk-1 and deltaElk-1. The expression of Elk-1 and deltaElk-1 proteins in the Elk-1/deltaElk-1 transfectants were analysed by immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot analysis. The Elk-1 unlike deltaElk-1 transfectants showed a shortened and flattened morphology compared to the parental cells. We have found that calcium ionophore treatment of Rat-1 Elk-1, MCF-7 Elk-1, Rat-1 deltaElk-1 and MCF-7 deltaElk-1 transfectants resulted in programmed cell death. These results indicate that constitutive expression of Elk-1 and deltaElk-1 proteins triggers apoptosis in Rat-1 fibroblasts and breast cancer cells when treated with calcium ionophore."
https://openalex.org/W2077978159,"Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) stimulates mitogenic, motogenic, and morphogenic responses in various cell types. We analysed HGF-responsive cells by differential display PCR to identify HGF-induced genes that mediate these biological events. One of the genes identified encoded a member of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) family, TIMP-3. HGF transiently induced TIMP-3 mRNA in keratinocytes as well as kidney and mammary epithelial cells maximally between 4 and 6 h post-stimulation. Increased TIMP-3 protein secretion returned to basal levels within 18 h, while the expression of gelatinases A and B remained unchanged, suggesting that temporary suppression of matrix degradation is a delayed early response to HGF. Ectopic overexpression of TIMP-3 in cultured leiomyosarcoma cells conferred an epithelial morphology, reduced cell growth rate, anchorage-independent growth, and matrix invasion in vitro. Antisense suppression of TIMP-3 was associated with a scattered, fibroblastic cell morphology, as well as enhanced proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and matrix invasion. A survey of tumor cell lines revealed an inverse relationship between metastatic potential and TIMP-3 expression level. These data suggest that early, transient TIMP-3 expression mediates specific HGF-induced phenotypic changes, and that loss of TIMP-3 expression may enhance the invasion potential of certain tumors."

https://openalex.org/W2043222317,"Approximately 25-30% of childhood pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (pre-B ALL) is characterized by the presence of a (1;19)(q23;p13.3) translocation. The presence of this translocation is generally accompanied by a poor prognosis. The chimeric gene resulting from this chromosomal rearrangement encodes a hybrid transcription factor, E2A-Pbx1. In an attempt to delineate the genetic cascade initiated by E2A-Pbx1, we sought to identify genes that are deregulated by this transcription factor in t(1;19) pre-B ALL. We show here that the gene encoding the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFr) is specifically upregulated in pre-B cells expressing E2A-Pbx1. G-CSFr is also expressed in cell lines established from t(1;19) pre-B cell leukemia and on primary t(1;19) tumor cells, but not on control cells. These data indicate that G-CSFr gene is a target for deregulation by E2A-Pbx1."

https://openalex.org/W2321588377,"The SH2-containing tyrosine phosphatase Shp-2 appears to function downstream of a variety of growth factor receptors and might play a positive role in cell proliferation. Here we report that expression of the beta subunit of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR-beta) was specifically downregulated in mutant fibroblasts lacking a functional Shp-2, while the levels of PDGFR-alpha EGFR and IGFIR were not changed. PDGF-stimulated DNA synthesis and extracellular signal regulated kinase (Erk) activation was severely suppressed in mutant cells. RasGAP, that responds to activation of PDGFR-beta but not PDGFR-alpha, was not phosphorylated on tyrosine in mutant cells upon PDGF-treatment. Northern blot analysis failed to detect PDGFR-beta mRNA in mutant cells. The transcription initiation from the PDGFR-beta gene promoter was not significantly changed, but the half-life of its mRNA was shortened in Shp-2 mutant cells. These observations indicate that Shp-2 not only participates in transmission of signals from growth factor receptors but also plays a specific role in the control of the PDGFR-beta expression. We propose that this is an important mechanism for the positive control of cell proliferation by Shp-2."
