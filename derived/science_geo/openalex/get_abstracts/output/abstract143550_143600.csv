https://openalex.org/W1994715177,"In a typical thermoelectric device, a junction is formed from two different conducting materials, one containing positive charge carriers (holes) and the other negative charge carriers (electrons). When an electric current is passed in the appropriate direction through the junction, both types of charge carriers move away from the junction and convey heat away, thus cooling the junction. Similarly, a heat source at the junction causes carriers to flow away from the junction, making an electrical generator. Such devices have the advantage of containing no moving parts, but low efficiencies have limited their use to specialty applications, such as cooling laser diodes. The principles of thermoelectric devices are reviewed and strategies for increasing the efficiency of novel materials are explored. Improved materials would not only help to cool advanced electronics but could also provide energy benefits in refrigeration and when using waste heat to generate electrical power."

https://openalex.org/W2145078103,"The generation of cell-mediated immunity against many infectious pathogens involves the production of interleukin-12 (IL-12), a key signal of the innate immune system. Yet, for many pathogens, the molecules that induce IL-12 production by macrophages and the mechanisms by which they do so remain undefined. Here it is shown that microbial lipoproteins are potent stimulators of IL-12 production by human macrophages, and that induction is mediated by Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Several lipoproteins stimulated TLR-dependent transcription of inducible nitric oxide synthase and the production of nitric oxide, a powerful microbicidal pathway. Activation of TLRs by microbial lipoproteins may initiate innate defense mechanisms against infectious pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2109715166,"A computational method is proposed for inferring protein interactions from genome sequences on the basis of the observation that some pairs of interacting proteins have homologs in another organism fused into a single protein chain. Searching sequences from many genomes revealed 6809 such putative protein-protein interactions in Escherichia coli and 45,502 in yeast. Many members of these pairs were confirmed as functionally related; computational filtering further enriches for interactions. Some proteins have links to several other proteins; these coupled links appear to represent functional interactions such as complexes or pathways. Experimentally confirmed interacting pairs are documented in a Database of Interacting Proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1973788573,"We determined that two mouse cryptochrome genes, mCry1 and mCry2, act in the negative limb of the clock feedback loop. In cell lines, mPER proteins (alone or in combination) have modest effects on their cellular location and ability to inhibit CLOCK:BMAL1 -mediated transcription. This suggested cryptochrome involvement in the negative limb of the feedback loop. Indeed, mCry1 and mCry2 RNA levels are reduced in the central and peripheral clocks of Clock/Clock mutant mice. mCRY1 and mCRY2 are nuclear proteins that interact with each of the mPER proteins, translocate each mPER protein from cytoplasm to nucleus, and are rhythmically expressed in the suprachiasmatic circadian clock. Luciferase reporter gene assays show that mCRY1 or mCRY2 alone abrogates CLOCK:BMAL1-E box-mediated transcription. The mPER and mCRY proteins appear to inhibit the transcriptional complex differentially."
https://openalex.org/W2047376205,"Apoptosis is implicated in the generation and resolution of inflammation in response to bacterial pathogens. All bacterial pathogens produce lipoproteins (BLPs), which trigger the innate immune response. BLPs were found to induce apoptosis in THP-1 monocytic cells through human Toll-like receptor-2 (hTLR2). BLPs also initiated apoptosis in an epithelial cell line transfected with hTLR2. In addition, BLPs stimulated nuclear factor-kappaB, a transcriptional activator of multiple host defense genes, and activated the respiratory burst through hTLR2. Thus, hTLR2 is a molecular link between microbial products, apoptosis, and host defense mechanisms."

Various renewable systems are presented, and the issues of energy payback, carbon dioxide abatement, and energy storage are addressed. Pathways for renewable hydrogen generation are shown, and the implementation of hydrogen technologies into the energy infrastructure is presented. The question is asked, Should money and energy be spent on carbon dioxide sequestration, or should renewable resources be implemented instead."
https://openalex.org/W2147176626,"Vascular endothelial cadherin, VE-cadherin, mediates adhesion between endothelial cells and may affect vascular morphogenesis via intracellular signaling, but the nature of these signals remains unknown. Here, targeted inactivation (VEC-/-) or truncation of the beta-catenin-binding cytosolic domain (VECdeltaC/deltaC) of the VE-cadherin gene was found not to affect assembly of endothelial cells in vascular plexi, but to impair their subsequent remodeling and maturation, causing lethality at 9.5 days of gestation. Deficiency or truncation of VE-cadherin induced endothelial apoptosis and abolished transmission of the endothelial survival signal by VEGF-A to Akt kinase and Bcl2 via reduced complex formation with VEGF receptor-2, beta-catenin, and phosphoinositide 3 (PI3)-kinase. Thus, VE-cadherin/ beta-catenin signaling controls endothelial survival."
https://openalex.org/W2043614029,"The advantages and limitations of photovoltaic solar modules for energy generation are reviewed with their operation principles and physical efficiency limits. Although the main materials currently used or investigated and the associated fabrication technologies are individually described, emphasis is on silicon-based solar cells. Wafer-based crystalline silicon solar modules dominate in terms of production, but amorphous silicon solar cells have the potential to undercut costs owing, for example, to the roll-to-roll production possibilities for modules. Recent developments suggest that thin-film crystalline silicon (especially microcrystalline silicon) is becoming a prime candidate for future photovoltaics."
https://openalex.org/W2064496329,"Self-renewing, totipotent embryonic stem (ES) cells may provide a virtually unlimited donor source for transplantation. A protocol that permits the in vitro generation of precursors for oligodendrocytes and astrocytes from ES cells was devised. Transplantation in a rat model of a human myelin disease shows that these ES cell–derived precursors interact with host neurons and efficiently myelinate axons in brain and spinal cord. Thus, ES cells can serve as a valuable source of cell type–specific somatic precursors for neural transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W1966070420,"Surface proteins of Gram-positive bacteria are linked to the bacterial cell wall by a mechanism that involves cleavage of a conserved Leu-Pro-X-Thr-Gly (LPXTG) motif and that occurs during assembly of the peptidoglycan cell wall. A Staphylococcus aureus mutant defective in the anchoring of surface proteins was isolated and shown to carry a mutation in the srtA gene. Overexpression of srtA increased the rate of surface protein anchoring, and homologs of srtA were found in other pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria. The protein specified by srtA , sortase, may be a useful target for the development of new antimicrobial drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2096353669,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are invariably upregulated in the stromal compartment of epithelial cancers and appear to promote invasion and metastasis. Here we report that phenotypically normal mammary epithelial cells with tetracycline-regulated expression of MMP3/stromelysin-1 (Str1) form epithelial glandular structures in vivo without Str1 but form invasive mesenchymal-like tumors with Str1. Once initiated, the tumors become independent of continued Str1 expression. Str1 also promotes spontaneous premalignant changes and malignant conversion in mammary glands of transgenic mice. These changes are blocked by coexpression of a TIMP1 transgene. The premalignant and malignant lesions have stereotyped genomic changes unlike those seen in other murine mammary cancer models. These data indicate that Str1 influences tumor initiation and alters neoplastic risk."
https://openalex.org/W2024591653,"The erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) is essential for production of red blood cells; a principal function of EpoR is to rescue committed erythroid progenitors from apoptosis. Stat5 is rapidly activated following EpoR stimulation, but its function in erythropoiesis has been unclear since adult Stat5a−/−5b−/− mice have normal steady-state hematocrit. Here we show that Stat5 is essential for the high erythropoietic rate during fetal development. Stat5a−/−5b−/− embryos are severely anemic; erythroid progenitors are present in low numbers, show higher levels of apoptosis, and are less responsive to Epo. These findings are explained by a crucial role for Stat5 in EpoR's antiapoptotic signaling: it mediates the immediate-early induction of Bcl-XL in erythroid cells through direct binding to the Bcl-X promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2023687572,"Serum response factor (SRF) regulates transcription of many serum-inducible and muscle-specific genes. Using a functional screen, we identified LIM kinase-1 as a potent activator of SRF. We show that SRF activation by LIM kinase-1 is dependent on its ability to regulate actin treadmilling. LIM kinase activity is not essential for SRF activation by serum, but signals depend on alterations in actin dynamics. Studies with actin-binding drugs, the actin-specific C2 toxin, and actin overexpression demonstrate that G-actin level controls SRF. Regulation of actin dynamics is necessary for serum induction of a subset of SRF target genes, including vinculin, cytoskeletal actin, and srf itself, and also suffices for their activation. Actin treadmilling provides a convergence point for both serum- and LIM kinase-1-induced signaling to SRF."
https://openalex.org/W2049598883,"BRCA1 encodes a tumor suppressor that is mutated in familial breast and ovarian cancers. Here, it is shown that BRCA1 interacts in vitro and in vivo with hRad50, which forms a complex with hMre11 and p95/nibrin. Upon irradiation, BRCA1 was detected in discrete foci in the nucleus, which colocalize with hRad50. Formation of irradiation-induced foci positive for BRCA1, hRad50, hMre11, or p95 was dramatically reduced in HCC/1937 breast cancer cells carrying a homozygous mutation in BRCA1 but was restored by transfection of wild-type BRCA1 . Ectopic expression of wild-type, but not mutated, BRCA1 in these cells rendered them less sensitive to the DNA damage agent, methyl methanesulfonate. These data suggest that BRCA1 is important for the cellular responses to DNA damage that are mediated by the hRad50-hMre11-p95 complex."

https://openalex.org/W2070440733,"Estrogen receptor α transcriptional activity is regulated by distinct conformational states that are the result of ligand binding. Phage display was used to identify peptides that interact specifically with either estradiol- or tamoxifen-activated estrogen receptor α. When these peptides were coexpressed with estrogen receptor α in cells, they functioned as ligand-specific antagonists, indicating that estradiol-agonist and tamoxifen–partial agonist activities do not occur by the same mechanism. The ability to regulate estrogen receptor α transcriptional activity by targeting sites outside of the ligand-binding pocket has implications for the development of estrogen receptor α antagonists for the treatment of tamoxifen-refractory breast cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2015068634,"Many psychotropic drugs interfere with the reuptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. Transport capacity is regulated by kinase-linked pathways, particularly those involving protein kinase C (PKC), resulting in transporter phosphorylation and sequestration. Phosphorylation and sequestration of the serotonin transporter (SERT) were substantially impacted by ligand occupancy. Ligands that can permeate the transporter, such as serotonin or the amphetamines, prevented PKC-dependent SERT phosphorylation. Nontransported SERT antagonists such as cocaine and antidepressants were permissive for SERT phosphorylation but blocked serotonin effects. PKC-dependent SERT sequestration was also blocked by serotonin. These findings reveal activity-dependent modulation of neurotransmitter reuptake and identify previously unknown consequences of amphetamine, cocaine, and antidepressant action."

https://openalex.org/W1976215537,"An abrupt episode of global warming marked the end of the Paleocene epoch. Oxygen and carbon isotope records from two widely separated sites support the notion that degassing of biogenic methane hydrate may have been an important factor in altering Earth's climate. The data show evidence for multiple injections of methane, separated by intervals in which the carbon cycle was in stasis. Correlations between the two sites suggest that even these small-scale events were global in nature."
https://openalex.org/W2071319701,"High-temperature engine applications have been limited by the performance of metal alloys and carbide fiber composites at elevated temperatures. Random inorganic networks composed of silicon, boron, nitrogen, and carbon represent a novel class of ceramics with outstanding durability at elevated temperatures. SiBN(3)C was synthesized by pyrolysis of a preceramic N-methylpolyborosilazane made from the single-source precursor Cl(3)Si-NH-BCl(2). The polymer can be processed to a green fiber by melt-spinning, which then undergoes an intermediate curing step and successive pyrolysis. The ceramic fibers, which are presently produced on a semitechnical scale, combine several desired properties relevant for an application in fiber-reinforced ceramic composites: thermal stability, mechanical strength, high-temperature creep resistivity, low density, and stability against oxidation or molten silicon."
https://openalex.org/W2151421295,"Adenylyl cyclase (AC) converts adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic adenosine monophosphate, a ubiquitous second messenger that regulates many cellular functions. Recent structural studies have revealed much about the structure and function of mammalian AC but have not fully defined its active site or catalytic mechanism. Four crystal structures were determined of the catalytic domains of AC in complex with two different ATP analogs and various divalent metal ions. These structures provide a model for the enzyme-substrate complex and conclusively demonstrate that two metal ions bind in the active site. The similarity of the active site of AC to those of DNA polymerases suggests that the enzymes catalyze phosphoryl transfer by the same two-metal-ion mechanism and likely have evolved from a common ancestor."
https://openalex.org/W1975809429,"Unique attributes in sequences of recurring, similar microearthquakes at Parkfield, California, provide a means for inferring slip rate at depth throughout the active fault surface from the time intervals between sequence events. Application of the method using an 11-year microseismicity record revealed systematic spatial and temporal changes in the slip rate that were synchronous with earthquake activity and other independent measures of fault-zone slip. If this phenomenon is found to be generally common behavior in active faults, it forms the basis for a method to monitor the changing strain field throughout a seismogenic fault zone."

https://openalex.org/W2011206098,"At least 85 percent selectivity to ethylene at greater than 70 percent conversion can be obtained by partial oxidation of ethane by adding large amounts of H 2 to the reaction mixture and using a platinum-tin catalyst operating at 950°C with a contact time of ∼10 −3 seconds. This system almost totally shuts off the reactions that form undesired CO and CO 2 , which fall from 20 percent without H 2 to 5 percent when H 2 is added. Although a 2/1 H 2 /O 2 mixture should be explosive at high temperatures, no flames or explosions occur in the presence of ethane. The successive reactions on the catalyst generate more H 2 than used in the feed, so with recycle no additional H 2 would be needed. These results are unexpected because ethylene is a nonequilibrium product and entropy considerations argue that all reaction channels open at high temperatures so the products should approach equilibrium, which predicts only a few percent ethylene. This process is promising for the replacement of steam cracking in the production of ethylene."

https://openalex.org/W1570032933,"Febrile (fever-induced) seizures affect 3-5% of infants and young children. Despite the high incidence of febrile seizures, their contribution to the development of epilepsy later in life has remained controversial. Combining a new rat model of complex febrile seizures and patch clamp techniques, we determined that hyperthermia-induced seizures in the immature rat cause a selective presynaptic increase in inhibitory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus that lasts into adulthood. The long-lasting nature of these potent alterations in synaptic communication after febrile seizures does not support the prevalent view of the 'benign' nature of early-life febrile convulsions."

https://openalex.org/W2155744341,"This Viewpoint examines data on international trends in energy research and development (R&D) funding, patterns of U.S. energy technology patents and R&D funding, and U.S. R&D intensities across selected sectors. The data present a disturbing picture: (i) Energy technology funding levels have declined significantly during the past two decades throughout the industrial world; (ii) U.S. R&D spending and patents, both overall and in the energy sector, have been highly correlated during the past two decades; and (iii) the R&D intensity of the U.S. energy sector is extremely low. It is argued that recent cutbacks in energy R&D are likely to reduce the capacity of the energy sector to innovate. The trends are particularly troubling given the need for increased international capacity to respond to emerging risks such as global climate change."

https://openalex.org/W2076324043,"In many instances, remote signaling involves the transport of secreted molecules. Here, we examine the spread of Wingless within the embryonic epidermis of Drosophila. Using two assays for Wingless activity (specification of naked cuticle and repression of rhomboid transcription), we found that Wingless acts at a different range in the anterior and posterior directions. We show that this asymmetry follows in part from differential distribution of the Wingless protein. Transport or stability is reduced within engrailed-expressing cells, and farther posteriorward Wingless movement is blocked at the presumptive segment boundary and perhaps beyond. We demonstrate the role of hedgehog in the formation of this barrier."
https://openalex.org/W2030810484,"Drosophila melanogaster pair-rule segmentation gene transcripts localize apically of nuclei in blastoderm embryos. This might occur by asymmetric (vectorial) export from one side of the nucleus or by transport within the cytoplasm. We have followed fluorescently labeled pair-rule transcripts postinjection into Drosophila embryos. Naked, microinjected fushi tarazu (ftz) transcripts do not localize in blastoderm embryos, indicating that cytoplasmic mechanisms alone are insufficient for apical targeting. However, prior exposure of ftz to Drosophila or human embryonic nuclear extract leads to rapid, specific, microtubule-dependent transport, arguing against vectorial export. We present evidence that ftz transcript localization involves the Squid (Hrp40) hnRNP protein and that the activity of hnRNP proteins in promoting transcript localization is evolutionarily conserved. We propose that cytoplasmic localization machineries recognize transcripts in the context of nuclear partner proteins."

Through extensive longitudinal analyses of human factor IX gene expression in transgenic mice, two essential age-regulatory elements, AE5' and AE3', have been identified. These elements are required and together are sufficient for normal age regulation of factor IX expression. AE5', a PEA-3 related element present in the 5' upstream region of the gene encoding factor IX, is responsible for age-stable expression of the gene. AE3', in the middle of the 3' untranslated region, is responsible for age-associated elevation in messenger RNA levels. In a concerted manner, AE5' and AE3' recapitulate natural patterns of the advancing age-associated increase in factor IX gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2049156052,"Although in the past, environmental engineering has been primarily concerned with waste disposal, the focus of the field is now shifting toward viewing wastes as potential resources. Because reclamation usually consumes less energy than producing new materials, increasing reclamation not only reduces pollution but saves energy. Technological innovations contributing to this shift are summarized here, and are variously classified as emerging technologies or research topics, as either new departures or incremental improvements, and as opportunistic innovations, or examples of a unifying strategy. Both liquid and solid waste examples are given, such as a recent discovery of effects in disinfecting microfiltered reclaimed wastewater with ultraviolet light. In addition to its value in reducing pollution and conserving energy, this reorientation of environmental engineering could contribute to a more general shift toward greater cooperation among organizations dealing with the environment."
https://openalex.org/W2096883850,"Geochemical fluxes into and out of the ocean control its chemical composition. Measurements of the magnesium (Mg) content of seawater, an assumed ""conservative"" element in the ocean, reveal mid-depth Mg depletions in the vicinity of the East Pacific Rise. The magnitude of the anomalies suggests that fluxes associated with the low-temperature circulation of seawater through axial mid-ocean ridge systems are much larger than the high-temperature axial component. A higher total axial hydrothermal flux provides a mechanism that simultaneously satisfies the mass balance requirement of several major seawater constituents."

The spatial extent of electronic wave functions is probed by investigating the dependence of these energies on changes in the dot confining potential. For low electron densities, electrons occupy distinct spatial sites localized within the dot. At higher densities, the electrons become delocalized, and all wave functions are spread over the full dot area. Near the delocalization transition, the last remaining localized states exist at the perimeter of the dot. Unexpectedly, these electrons appear to bind with electrons in the dot center."
