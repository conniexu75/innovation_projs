https://openalex.org/W3092333808,"Background Social distancing measures (e.g., avoiding travel, limiting physical contact with people outside of one’s household, and maintaining a 1 or 2-metre distance between self and others when in public, depending on the country) are the primary strategies used to prevent transmission of the SARS-Cov-2 virus that causes COVID-19. Given that there is no effective treatment or vaccine for COVID-19, it is important to identify barriers and facilitators to adherence to social distancing to inform ongoing and future public health campaigns. Method This cross-sectional study was conducted online with a convenience sample of English-speaking adults. The survey was administered over the course of three weeks (March 30 –April 16, 2020) when social distancing measures were well-enforced in North America and Europe. Participants were asked to complete measures assessing socio-demographic characteristics, psychological constructs, including motivations to engage in social distancing, prosocial attitudes, distress, and social distancing behaviors. Descriptive (mean, standard deviation, percentage) and inferential statistics (logistic regression) were used to describes endorsement rates for various motivations, rates of adherence to social distancing recommendations, and predictors of adherence. Results Data were collected from 2013 adults living primarily in North America and Europe. Most frequently endorsed motivations to engage in social distancing (or facilitators) included “I want to protect others” (86%), “I want to protect myself” (84%), and I feel a sense of responsibility to protect our community” (84%). Most frequently endorsed motivations against social distancing (or barriers) included “There are many people walking on the streets in my area” (31%), “I have friends or family who need me to run errands for them” (25%), “I don’t trust the messages my government provides about the pandemic” (13%), and “I feel stressed when I am alone or in isolation” (13%). Adherence to social distancing recommendations ranged from 45% for “working from home or remotely” to 90% for “avoiding crowded places/non-essential travel”, with men and younger individuals (18–24 years) showing lower adherence compared to women and older individuals. Conclusion This study found that adherence to social distancing recommendations vary depending on the behaviour, with none of the surveyed behaviours showing perfect adherence. Strongest facilitators included wanting to protect the self, feeling a responsibility to protect the community, and being able to work/study remotely; strongest barriers included having friends or family who needed help with running errands and socializing in order to avoid feeling lonely. Future interventions to improve adherence to social distancing measures should couple individual-level strategies targeting key barriers to social distancing identified herein, with effective institutional measures and public health interventions. Public health campaigns should continue to highlight compassionate attitudes towards social distancing."
https://openalex.org/W3036750843,"The current coronavirus pandemic is an unprecedented public health challenge that is having a devastating economic impact on households. Using a sample of 230,540 respondents to an online survey from 17 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, the study shows that the economic impacts are large and unequal: 45 percent of respondents report that a household member has lost their job and, among households owning small businesses, 59 percent of respondents report that a household member has closed their business. Among households with the lowest income prior to the pandemic, 71 percent report that a household member lost their job and 61 percent report that a household member has closed their business. Declines in food security and health are among the disproportionate impacts. The findings provide evidence that the current public health crisis will exacerbate economic inequality and provides some of the first estimates of the impact of the pandemic on the labor market and well-being in developing countries."
https://openalex.org/W3092370600,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has devastated many countries with ripple effects felt in various sectors of the global economy. In November 2019, the Global Health Security (GHS) Index was released as the first detailed assessment and benchmarking of 195 countries to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats. This paper presents the first comparison of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD countries' performance during the pandemic, with the pre-COVID-19 pandemic preparedness as determined by the GHS Index. Using a rank-based analysis, four indices were compared between select countries, including total cases, total deaths, recovery rate, and total tests performed, all standardized for comparison. Our findings suggest a discrepancy between the GHS index rating and the actual performance of countries during this pandemic, with an overestimation of the preparedness of some countries scoring highly on the GHS index and underestimation of the preparedness of other countries with relatively lower scores on the GHS index."
https://openalex.org/W3091004423,"Cortical computations are critically reliant on their local circuit, GABAergic cells. In the hippocampus, a large body of work has identified an unprecedented diversity of GABAergic interneurons with pronounced anatomical, molecular, and physiological differences. Yet little is known about the functional properties and activity dynamics of the major hippocampal interneuron classes in behaving animals. Here we use fast, targeted, three-dimensional (3D) two-photon calcium imaging coupled with immunohistochemistry-based molecular identification to retrospectively map in vivo activity onto multiple classes of interneurons in the mouse hippocampal area CA1 during head-fixed exploration and goal-directed learning. We find examples of preferential subtype recruitment with quantitative differences in response properties and feature selectivity during key behavioral tasks and states. These results provide new insights into the collective organization of local inhibitory circuits supporting navigational and mnemonic functions of the hippocampus."
https://openalex.org/W3092568232,"Individuals who encounter false information on social media may actively spread it further, by sharing or otherwise engaging with it. Much of the spread of disinformation can thus be attributed to human action. Four studies (total N = 2,634) explored the effect of message attributes (authoritativeness of source, consensus indicators), viewer characteristics (digital literacy, personality, and demographic variables) and their interaction (consistency between message and recipient beliefs) on self-reported likelihood of spreading examples of disinformation. Participants also reported whether they had shared real-world disinformation in the past. Reported likelihood of sharing was not influenced by authoritativeness of the source of the material, nor indicators of how many other people had previously engaged with it. Participants' level of digital literacy had little effect on their responses. The people reporting the greatest likelihood of sharing disinformation were those who thought it likely to be true, or who had pre-existing attitudes consistent with it. They were likely to have previous familiarity with the materials. Across the four studies, personality (lower Agreeableness and Conscientiousness, higher Extraversion and Neuroticism) and demographic variables (male gender, lower age and lower education) were weakly and inconsistently associated with self-reported likelihood of sharing. These findings have implications for strategies more or less likely to work in countering disinformation in social media."
https://openalex.org/W3091823103,"Microplastics, particularly microfibers, are ubiquitous, found in aquatic (freshwater and marine) and terrestrial environments and within the food web worldwide. It is well-established that microplastics in the form of textile fibers enter the environment via washing machines and wastewater treatment effluent. Less is known about the release of microfibers from electric clothes dryers. In this study we measure microfiber emissions from home installed dryers at two different sites. At each site the distribution of fibers landing on the snow’s surface outside dryer vents and the weight of lint in dryer exhaust exiting dryer vents were measured. Fibers from the pink polyester fleece blankets used in this study were found in plots throughout a 30ft (9.14m) radius from the dryer vents, with an average number across all plots of 404 ± 192 (SD) (Site 1) and 1,169 ± 606 (SD) (Site 2). The majority of the fibers collected were located within 5 ft (1.52m) of the vents. Averages of 35 ± 16(SD)mg (Site 1) and 70 ± 77 (SD)mg (Site 2) of lint from three consecutive dry cycles were collected from dryer vent exhaust. This study establishes that electric clothes dryers emit masses of microfiber directly into the environment. Microfiber emissions vary based on dryer type, age, vent installation and lint trap characteristics. Therefore, dryers should be included in discussions when considering strategies, policies and innovations to prevent and mitigate microfiber pollution."

Significantly, and in contrast to earlier reports, they reported an increased risk of death in female mice from several mutant C9ORF72 BAC transgenic lines, with a substantial portion of their study focused on the early mortality of mice harboring a C9ORF72 transgene with 500 GGGGCC repeats (C9-500). Prior to their demise, these C9-500 mice were also described as displaying several behavioral phenotypes reminiscent of ALS/FTD, including deficits in motor performance and anxiety-like behaviors. More specifically, a subset of female C9-500 mice had a rapidly progressive “acute” phenotype that included labored breathing, sudden weight loss, and hindlimb weakness. Further investigation led to the conclusion that behavioral changes in the acute progressive C9-500 animals were likely caused by underlying degeneration of hippocampal and spinal cord motor neurons. Additionally, a larger number of C9-500 mice developed a “slow” progressive phenotype characterized by reduced activity, hyperactivity when provoked, and intermittent seizures. The findings by Liu and colleagues were striking because they are consistent with the notion that gain-of-function effects of the C9ORF72 mutant gene are sufficient to cause the hallmark pathologies found in ALS/FTD patients. Furthermore, their results suggest that C9-500 transgenic mice are an exciting preclinical animal model for testing hypotheses concerning how the C9ORF72 mutations lead to neural degeneration and assessing the preclinical effectiveness of candidate therapeutics (Hayes and Rothstein, 2016Hayes L.R. Rothstein J.D. C9ORF72-ALS/FTD: transgenic mice make a come-BAC.Neuron. 2016; 90: 427-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Given our respective interests in how the C9ORF72 mutation causes ALS/FTD and our desire to critically evaluate new therapeutic strategies in a relevant mouse model, we obtained, characterized, and then extensively phenotyped two independent cohorts of C9-500 animals at Harvard University (HU) and Johns Hopkins University (JHU). The C9-500 transgenic colony studied at HU was obtained through rederivation by aseptic embryo transfer at the Jackson lab from founders obtained from the University of Florida (UF), although the JHU cohort was obtained directly from the Ranum colony at UF. Encouragingly, both of our groups (HU and JHU) were able to confirm that our cohorts of C9-500 mice harbored and expressed the expected number of C9ORF72 hexanucleotide repeats. However, and in contrast to the results of Liu et al., detailed phenotyping of the transgenic mice in our two colonies demonstrated that their motor function and survival were indistinguishable from non-transgenic littermate controls and that there was no evidence of ongoing neurodegeneration or neuroinflammation. Thus, our findings from studies of the C9-500 BAC model are more consistent with earlier reports of C9ORF72-BAC animals (O’Rourke et al., 2015O’Rourke J.G. Bogdanik L. Muhammad A.K.M.G. Gendron T.F.

Here, we propose a series of factors that could explain the discrepancies between our findings and those reported by Liu and colleagues (Liu et al., 2016Liu Y. Pattamatta A. Zu T. Reid T. Bardhi O. Borchelt D.R. Yachnis A.T. Ranum L.P.

Two independent cohorts of the C9-500 BAC gain-of-function mouse model, which was initially developed and characterized by Liu et al., 2016Liu Y. Pattamatta A. Zu T. Reid T. Bardhi O. Borchelt D.R.

The JHU colony was established using C9-500 transgenic mice on the FVB genetic background obtained directly from Liu and colleagues (UF) and crossed with wild-type FVB breeders from Jackson Laboratory (JAX) to establish experimental animals. For the HU colony, C9-500 animals on the FVB genetic background were obtained from JAX following isogenic rederivation by embryo transfer using founders obtained from UF and propagated at HU through intercross with wild-type FVB animals obtained from JAX. Given the known instability of repeat expansion mutations, we first sought to verify that mice in both the JHU and HU colonies harbored the expected number of GGGGCC repeats within the mutant C9ORF72 BAC transgene reported by Liu and colleagues. Southern blot analysis of DNA from transgenic mice in both HU and JHU colonies showed that most animals contained a repeat length of approximately 500 GGGGCC repeats (Figures 1A and 1B ). Importantly, direct comparison of DNA from transgenic mice studied at JHU with DNA provided from transgenic animals at UF confirmed that most animals at JHU possessed a C9ORF72 transgene of a comparable repeat length. We did note that, in any given cohort, a small number of animals displayed a retraction of repeat length (see, for instance, Figure 1A, animal no. 3), which was consistent with the reported intergenerational instability of this model (Liu et al., 2016Liu Y. Pattamatta A. Zu T. Reid T. Bardhi O. Borchelt D.R. Yachnis A.T. Ranum L.P. C9orf72 BAC mouse model with motor deficits and neurodegenerative features of ALS/FTD.Neuron. 2016; 90: 521-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We therefore validated repeat length in each experimental transgenic animal by Southern blot for our studies before inclusion in any behavioral or pathologic study. As the hexanucleotide expansion at C9ORF72 is composed of GGGGCC repeats, we reasoned that it could be subjected to DNA methylation and epigenetic silencing. To rule out this possibility, we examined brain expression of the human C9ORF72 transgene. Examination of the abundance of both sense and antisense transcripts by quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated expression levels in HU animals comparable to those previously reported (Figure 1C). Although quantification of DPR protein expression by ELISA had not been previously reported for C9-500 animals, we found that transgenic mice at JHU, but not littermate controls, expressed poly-GP in the forebrain at levels similar to or even higher than reported in other BAC mouse models (Figure 1D; Gendron et al., 2017Gendron T.F.

Liu and colleagues reported that a subset of C9-500 BAC transgenic females developed a rapidly progressive disease characterized by sudden weight loss, paralysis, and decreased survival between 20 and 40 weeks, termed acute disease (Liu et al., 2016Liu Y. Pattamatta A. Zu T. Reid T. Bardhi O. Borchelt D.R. Yachnis A.T. Ranum L.P. C9orf72 BAC mouse model with motor deficits and neurodegenerative features of ALS/FTD.Neuron. 2016; 90: 521-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Based on this previous observation and because body weight is used as a measure of disease progression in ALS rodent models, we closely monitored and weighed C9-500 animals and littermate controls in our respective cohorts. However, we did not observe female transgenic mice to develop an acute phenotype of severe weight loss and sudden onset of paralysis followed by death in this time window. We further extended our analysis to both males and females but did not observe a significant difference in weight arise between C9-500 and wild-type animals in either sex during a year of study (HU: female wild type [WT] n = 20, female C9-BAC n = 15; not significant [p > 0.9999 all weeks]; male WT n = 20, male C9-BAC n = 19; not significant [p > 0.9999 all weeks]; JHU: female WT n = 15–18, female C9-BAC n = 15–26; not significant [p > 0.9999 all weeks]; male WT n = 19–31, male C9-BAC n = 19–23; not significant [p > 0.9999 all weeks]; Figures 2A–2D). Consistent with an absence of a decline in weight that might be indicative of symptom onset, neither female nor male C9-500 transgenic animals showed an increased risk of premature mortality relative to controls in either cohort over the course of 1 year (HU: female WT n = 20, female C9-BAC n = 31; p = 0.66; male WT n = 24, C9-BAC n = 20; male p = 1.00; JHU: female WT n = 22, C9-BAC n = 39; p = 0.55; male WT n = 33, C9-BAC n = 35; p = 0.69; Figures 2F and 2I). Of note, the vast majority of mouse deaths at both HU and JHU were animals found suddenly dead in cage without prior signs of weight loss, paralysis, or other concerning symptoms. This was in striking contrast to the previous report of Liu and colleagues, who found 36% percent mortality in female C9-500 animals relative to only 8% in controls (female WT n = 50; female C9-BAC n = 28; p < 0.01; Liu et al., 2016Liu Y. Pattamatta A. Zu T. Reid T. Bardhi O. Borchelt D.R. Yachnis A.T. Ranum L.P. C9orf72 BAC mouse model with motor deficits and neurodegenerative features of ALS/FTD.Neuron. 2016; 90: 521-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Although we did not observe overt changes in the health of C9-BAC animals, we still considered whether behavioral differences relevant to ALS or FTD might be arising in the JHU and HU cohorts, especially given that Liu et al. had reported decreased grip strength in female BAC mice (WT n = 5; C9-BAC “asymptomatic” n = 7; C9-BAC “acute end stage” n = 4; p < 0.05). Forelimb and hindlimb grip strength testing are well-established methods for testing motor function in ALS models. Unfortunately, we found no significant differences in grip strength between C9-500 and wild-type animals of either sex measured over 1 year at several time points (Figures 3A–3C; JHU: female WT n = 11–16, female C9-BAC n = 11–18, male WT n = 23–30, female C9-BAC n = 15–22; male forelimb not significant [ns], p > 0.9999 for all weeks, female forelimb ns, p > 0.9999 to 0.1677 for all weeks, male hindlimb ns, p > 0.9999 to 0.4751 for all weeks, and female hindlimb ns, p > 0.9999 for all weeks; HU: female WT n = 11–20, female C9-BAC n = 9–14, male WT n = 13–19, male C9-BAC n = 18–20, female forelimb ns, p > 0.9999 for all weeks, male forelimb ns, p > 0.9999 to 0.6018 for all weeks). At HU, we also attempted to employ a functional rating scale of motor decline developed for the SOD1 transgenic mouse model but did not observe C9-BAC animals to develop paralysis-related phenotypes. The open field test has been suggested as a potential measure of anxiety-like behavior in mice. Liu and colleagues reported that a subset of C9-500 animals spent 50% less time in the central region of the test chamber when compared to WT littermates (WT n = 7; C9-BAC asymptomatic n = 8; C9-BAC “symptomatic” n = 14; p < 0.001; Liu et al., 2016Liu Y. Pattamatta A. Zu T. Reid T. Bardhi O. Borchelt D.R. Yachnis A.T. Ranum L.P. C9orf72 BAC mouse model with motor deficits and neurodegenerative features of ALS/FTD.Neuron. 2016; 90: 521-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We therefore conducted the open field test in one cohort at several time points (weeks 24, 32, 40, and 48). We observed no significant differences between female C9-500 and control animals in either the total distance they traveled or time they spent in the center of the open field (HU: WT n = 14–30; C9-BAC n = 7–21; not significant at each week tested; Figure 3D). Thus, we conclude that we were unable to observe functional motor or behavioral phenotypes in two distinct cohorts of C9-500 mice. It is well known that pathological changes can occur in the hippocampus of C9ORF72-ALS/FTD patients. Liu et al. reported the dramatic loss of neurons in the cornu ammonis (CA) region of the hippocampus of acute end-stage animals. Though we did not observe the previously described acute behavioral phenotypes to occur in our cohorts, we proceeded to examine the histology of the hippocampus in animals at 1 year of age. We did not observe transgene linkage to signs of degeneration in any hippocampal region or increased staining of the microglia marker Iba1 (Figure 4) or significant changes in the number of choline acetyl transferase (ChAT)-positive neurons in ventral regions of the spinal cord (Figure S1). Although we did not observe transgene-linked pathologies, we did note chronic inactivity (~8.3% at HU and ~35% at JHU) as well as occasional seizure-like events (~3.8% at HU and ~12% at JHU) in our animal cohorts; however, we observed these phenotypes in both transgene carriers and non-carriers. We, therefore, suggest that they are likely due to the FVB genetic background where these unusual phenotypes have been previously reported (Hsiao et al., 1995Hsiao K.K. Borchelt D.R. Olson K. Johannsdottir R. Kitt C. Yunis W. Xu S. Eckman C. Younkin S.

Oliveira P. Sousa N. Maciel P. Motor and behavioural abnormalities associated with persistent spontaneous epilepsy in the fvb/n mouse strain.Scand. J. Lab. Anim.

Our studies of two independent cohorts of C9-500 animals show that both the length and the expression of the C9-500 transgene reported by Liu and colleagues seem sufficiently stable to allow this transgenic model to be shared widely. Unfortunately, we were unable to replicate the early mortality or any of the behavioral phenotypes previously described in these animals that would make them valuable for mechanistic enquiries or preclinical testing. Instead, our observations are consistent with the first reports of C9ORF72 BAC transgenic mouse models, which uniformly failed to detect decreased survival or motor deficits in their respective models (O’Rourke et al., 2015O’Rourke J.G.

Medical records of children and adolescents (aged <18 years) presenting with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus and DKA between 2000-2017 at the MacKay Children's Hospital were retrospectively reviewed. AKI was defined by an admission creatinine level >1.5 times the calculated expected baseline creatinine level. Patients were divided into three groups based on AKI severity: no AKI, mild AKI, and severe AKI. In total, 170 (56.5%) patients with DKA presented AKI (mild AKI, 116 [38.5%]; severe AKI, 54 [18.0%]). Heart rate and laboratory parameters related to dehydration, such as corrected sodium level and blood urea nitrogen, were strongly associated with AKI development (P<0.01). Blood pH, plasma glucose, and potassium levels were also associated with AKI. A negative correlation with borderline significance between the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and recovery time from metabolic acidosis was observed in the severe AKI group. AKI was highly prevalent in children and adolescents with DKA. An association between AKI and biomarkers indicating dehydration was noted. The recovery time from metabolic acidosis following treatment may be longer in children with a decreased eGFR who present with severe AKI. AKI is a common complication in children with DKA."

Here, we used environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding to investigate fish biodiversity in five different estuaries in Japan. Water samples for eDNA were collected from river mouths and adjacent coastal areas of two estuaries with high degrees of development (the Tama and Miya Rivers) and three estuaries with relatively low degrees of development (the Aka, Takatsu, and Sendai Rivers). A total of 182 fish species across 67 families were detected. Among them, 11 species occurred in all the rivers studied. Rare fishes including endangered species were successfully detected in rich natural rivers. Biodiversity was the highest in the Sendai River and lowest in the Tama River, reflecting the degree of human development along each river. Even though nutrient concentration was low in both the Aka and Sendai Rivers, the latter exhibited greater diversity, including many tropical or subtropical species, owing to its more southern location. Species composition detected by eDNA varied among rivers, reflecting the distribution and migration of fishes. Our results are in accordance with the ecology of each fish species and environmental conditions of each river."
https://openalex.org/W3092046866,"The presence of the ‘Keilmesser-concept’ in late Middle Paleolithic assemblages of Central and Eastern Europe defines the eponymous ‘Keilmessergruppen’. The site of Lichtenberg (Lower Saxony, Germany) was discovered in 1987 and yielded one of the most important Keilmessergruppen assemblages of the northwestern European Plain. At that time, researchers used the bifacial backed knives to define a new type, the ‘Lichtenberger Keilmesser’, which they characterized by an aesthetic form-function concept with a specific range of morphological variability on the one hand, and a standardized convex cutting edge one the other hand. Thereby, a shape continuum was observed between different form-function concepts in the Lichtenberg assemblage, from Keilmesser through to Faustkeilblätter and handaxes. In a contrasting view, it was recently suggested that the morphology of Keilmesser, including what is defined here as type Lichtenberg, is the result of solutions to establish and maintain edge angles during resharpening. With the intention to evaluate these contrasting hypotheses, I conducted a re-analysis of the Keilmesser from Lichtenberg and their relationship to central German late Middle Paleolithic knives, using 3D geometric morphometric analyses and an automatized approach to measure edge angles on 3D models. Despite a morphological overlap of the tools from both regions, I could show that the Lichtenberg Keilmesser concept refers to one solution to create a tool with specific functionalities, like potentially cutting, prehension, and reusability. To establish and maintain its functionality, certain angles where created by the knappers along the active edges. This behavior resulted in specific shapes and positions of the active parts and created what looks like a standardized or template morphology of this Keilmesser type."

This can be seen in Political Correctness (PC) on the left, and white identitarian (WI) attitudes on the 'Alt-Right' (AR). While highly covered in mainstream media, limited academic research has investigated their possible antecedents and psychological correlates. The current study investigated the prevalence and psychological predictors of these attitudes. Utilising a quota-based sample of 512 U.S. participants, we found that extreme political attitudes were associated with various personality traits, social media use, and upbringing. PC attitudes were associated with agreeableness, black-white thinking, social-media use, and perceived overprotective parenting. WI attitudes were associated with low agreeableness and openness, and high black-white thinking. Our results show that extreme left and right attitudes are separated by individual differences, and that authoritarianism can be seen on both the left and the right."
https://openalex.org/W3092282042,"Experts are typically advised to avoid jargon when communicating with the general public, but previous research has not established whether avoiding jargon is necessary in a crisis. Using the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as a backdrop, this online survey experiment (N = 393) examined the effect of jargon use across three different topics that varied in situational urgency: COVID-19 (high urgency), flood risk (low urgency), and federal emergency policy (control). Results revealed that although the use of jargon led to more difficult processing and reduced persuasion for the two less-urgent topics (flood risk, emergency policy), there was no effect of jargon in the COVID-19 condition. Theoretically, these findings suggest that the motivation to process information is an important moderator for crisis communication in particular and science communication in general. Practically, these findings suggest that science communicators, during times of crisis, do not need to ""dumb down"" their language in the same way they should during non-crises."
https://openalex.org/W3091961099,"Introduction Cervical cancer is one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality among women in developing countries including Ethiopia. Unlike other types of cancers, the grave outcomes of cervical cancer could be prevented if detected at its early stage. However, in Ethiopia, awareness about the disease and the availability of screening and treatment services is limited. This study aims to determine the role of health education on cervical cancer screening uptake in selected health facilities in Addis Ababa. Methods Two-pronged clustered randomized controlled trial was conducted in 2018 at eight public health centers that provide cervical cancer screening services using visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Each of the eight health centers were randomly assigned to serve as either an intervention or a control center. A two-pronged clustered randomized controlled trial was conducted in eight public health care centers. All the selected facilities provided cervical cancer screening services using visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA). Four health centers were randomly assigned to the intervention and control arms. The study participants were women aged 30–49 years who sought care at maternal and child health clinics but who had never been screened for cervical cancer. In the intervention health centers, all eligible women received one-to-one health education and educational brochures about cervical cancer and cervical cancer screening. In the control health centers, participants received standard care. Baseline data were collected at recruitment and follow-up data were collected two months after the baseline. For the follow-up data collection, participants (both in the intervention and control arms) were interviewed over the phone to check whether they were screened for cervical cancer. Result From the 2,140 women who participated in the study, 215 (10%) screened for cervical cancer, where 152(71%) were from the intervention health centers. Seventy-four percent of these participants reported that they learned about the benefits of screening from the one-to-one health education or the brochure. Women from the intervention health centers had higher odds of getting screened (AOR = 2.43,95%CI;1.58–2.90) than the controls. Women with the educational status of the first degree and those who have a history of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) had higher odds of getting screened (AOR = 2.03,95%CI;(1.15–2.58) and (AOR = 1.55,95%CI;1.01–2.36), respectively. Conclusion and recommendation Providing focused health education supported by printed educational materials increased the uptake of cervical cancer screening services. Integrating one-to-one health education and providing a take-home educational material into the existing maternal and child health services can help increase cervical cancer screening uptake."

https://openalex.org/W3092040195,"Nematodes are representative soil metazoans with diverged species that play crucial roles in nutrient recycling in the pedosphere. Qualitative and quantitative information on nematode communities is useful for assessing soil quality, and DNA barcode-mediated taxonomic analysis is a powerful tool to investigate taxonomic compositions and changes in nematode communities. Here, we investigated four regions (regions 1–4) of the 18S small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU) gene as PCR targets of deep amplicon sequencing for the taxonomic profiling of individual soil nematodes. We determined the sequence variants (SVs) of 4 SSU regions for 96 nematodes (total 384 amplicons) isolated from copse soils and assigned their taxonomy using the QIIME2 software with dada2 or deblur algorithm and the SILVA database. Dada2 detected approximately 2-fold more nematode-derived SVs than deblur, and a larger number of SVs were obtained in regions 1 and 4 than those in other regions. These results and sufficient reference sequence coverage in region 4 indicated that DNA barcoding using a primer set for region 4 followed by dada2-based analysis would be most suitable for soil nematode taxonomic analysis. Eighteen SSU-derived operational taxonomic units (rOTUs) were obtained from 68 isolates, and their orders were determined based on the phylogenetic trees built by four regional sequences of rOTUs and 116 nematode reference species as well as the BLASTN search. The majority of the isolates were derived from three major orders Dorylaimida (6 rOTUs, 51.5% in 68 isolates), Rhabditida (4 rOTUs, 29.4%), and Triplonchida (7 rOTUs, 17.6%). The predicted feeding types of the isolates were fungivores (38.2% in total nematodes), plant feeders (32.4%), and 14.7% for both bacterivores and omnivores/predators. Additionally, we attempted to improve the branch structure of phylogenetic trees by using long nucleotide sequences artificially prepared by connecting regional sequences, but the effect was limited."

To complete a PMHP assessment, paramedics drew blood, measured point-of-care (POC) troponin (i-STAT; Abbott Point of Care) and calculated a HEAR score. Patients were stratified into three groups: high-risk based on an elevated troponin, low-risk based on a HEAR score <4 with a negative troponin, or moderate risk for a HEAR score ≥4 with a negative troponin. Sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values of the PMHP for detection of major adverse cardiac events (MACE: cardiac death, MI, or coronary revascularization) at 30-days were calculated. A total of 506 patients were accrued, with PMHP completed in 78.1% (395/506). MACE at 30-days occurred in 18.7% (74/395). Among these patients, 7.1% (28/395) were high risk yielding a specificity and PPV for 30-day MACE of 96.6% (95%CI: 94.0–98.3%) and 60.7% (95%CI: 40.6–78.6%) respectively.

https://openalex.org/W3091845999,"Anthracnose, caused by the fungal pathogen Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, is one of the world’s most destructive diseases of common bean. The use of resistant cultivars is the most cost-effective strategy to manage this disease; however, durable resistance is difficult to achieve due to the vast virulence diversity of the anthracnose pathogen. Finding new genes with broad-spectrum resistance increases the prospect of designing an effective anthracnose-management strategy. Genetic analysis confirmed the presence of a single, dominant anthracnose-resistance locus in AC, which we provisionally named Co-AC. Bulk segregant analysis and genetic mapping of two F2 populations from the crosses AC × PI207262 and AC × G 2333 were used to determine the position of the Co-AC locus in a 631 Kbp genomic region flanked by the SNP markers SS56 and SS92 on the lower arm of chromosome Pv01. By genotyping 77 F3 plants from the AC × PI207262 cross using nine additional markers, we fine-mapped the Co-AC locus to a significantly smaller genomic region (9.4 Kbp) flanked by the SNP markers SS102 and SS165. This 9.4 Kbp region harbors three predicted genes based on the common bean reference genome, notably including the gene model Phvul.001G244300, which encodes Clathrin heavy chain 1, a protein that supports specific stomatal regulation functions and might play a role in plant defense signaling. Because the Co-AC resistance locus is linked in cis, it can be selected with great efficiency using molecular markers. These results will be very useful for breeding programs aimed at developing bean cultivars with anthracnose resistance using marker-assisted selection. This study revealed the broad-spectrum resistance of AC to C. lindemuthianum and the existence of the Co-AC anthracnose-resistance locus. Fine mapping positioned this locus in a small genomic region on the lower end of chromosome Pv01 that contained three candidate genes for the Co-AC locus."

https://openalex.org/W3092211280,"Mosquitoes have increased in their abundance and geographic distribution in northeastern North America, coinciding with an increase in extreme precipitation events and up to a doubling of dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentrations in some inland waters. Increases in DOM can reduce exposure of mosquito larvae to solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Although mosquito larvae are most common in shaded habitats, almost nothing is known about their susceptibility to damage by solar UV radiation, or the ability of DOM to create a refuge from damaging UV in their shallow-water habitats. We hypothesize that 1) exposure to solar UV radiation is lethal to mosquito larvae, 2) larvae lack photo-enzymatic repair to fix UV-damaged DNA, and 3) DOM shades larvae from lethal solar UV radiation. We tested these hypotheses with experiments that manipulated UV radiation, the photo-repair radiation necessary for photo-enzymatic DNA repair, and DOM. Exposure to solar UV radiation significantly decreased larval survivorship, while DOM significantly increased it. There was no evidence of photo-enzymatic DNA repair. Our findings confirm that solar UV radiation decreases habitat suitability for mosquito larvae, but DOM provides a refuge from UV. This highlights the need for vector control managers to prioritize high DOM and shaded habitats in their efforts to reduce mosquito populations."

The present study aimed to examine the association between maternal secondhand smoking (SHS) during pregnancy and preterm birth. METHODS A 1:1 case-control study was conducted at delivery room of The Women's and Children's Hospital of An Giang, Vietnam. A total of 288 cases of preterm birth and 288 controls included in this study. A structured questionnaire in a face-to-face interview was used to assess SHS and potential confounders (maternal age, body mass index, occupation, education level, parity, antenatal care visits, history of preterm birth, prenatal bleeding and preeclampsia/eclampsia). RESULTS SHS was reported more frequently by women who delivered preterm babies compared with women of term deliveries (67.4% vs. 51.0%; P <0.001). After controlling all potential confounders, multivariable logistic regression analysis showed a relationship between SHS during pregnancy and preterm delivery (adjusted Odds ratio: 1.92; 95% CI 1.31, 2.81). CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that exposure to household tobacco smoke during pregnancy is associated with preterm birth."

The current study takes advantage of emotionality—operationally defined as positive valence and high arousal—to improve memory. In two experiments, the present paper addresses whether participants have more difficulty learning the names of objects they have never seen before in their foreign language and whether embedding them in a positive semantic context can help make learning easier. With this in mind, we had participants (with a minimum of a B2 level of English) in two experiments (43 participants in Experiment 1 and 54 in Experiment 2) read descriptions of made-up objects—either positive or neutral and either in their native or a foreign language. The effects of language varied with the difficulty of the task and measure used. In both cases, learning the words in a positive context improved learning. Importantly, the effect of emotionality was not modulated by language, suggesting that the effects of emotionality are independent of language and could potentially be a useful tool for improving foreign language vocabulary learning."
https://openalex.org/W3092567580,"A thermochemical nonequilibrium analysis was performed under the low enthalpy shock-tunnel flows. A quasi-one-dimensional flow calculation was employed by dividing the flow calculations into two parts, for the shock-tube and the Mach 6 nozzle. To describe the thermochemical nonequilibrium of the low enthalpy shock-tunnel flows, a three-temperature model is proposed. The three-temperature model treats the vibrational nonequilibrium of O2 and NO separately from the single nonequilibrium energy mode of the previous two-temperature model. In the three-temperature model, electron-electronic energies and vibrational energy of N2 are grouped as one energy mode, and vibrational energies of O2, O2+, and NO are grouped as another energy mode. The results for the shock-tunnel flows calculated using the three-temperature model were then compared with existing experimental data and the results obtained from one- and two-temperature models, for various operating conditions of the K1 shock-tunnel facility. The results of the thermochemical nonequilibrium analysis of the low enthalpy shock-tunnel flows suggest that the nonequilibrium characteristics of N2 and O2 need to be treated separately. The vibrational relaxation of O2 is much faster than that of N2 in low enthalpy condition, and the dissociation rate of O2 is manly influenced by the species vibrational temperature of O2. The proposed three-temperature model is able to describe the thermochemical nonequilibrium characteristics of N2 and O2 behind the incident and reflected shock waves, and the rapid vibrational freezing of N2 in nozzle expanding flows."
https://openalex.org/W3011364065,"Blood Concentrates (BCs) are autologous non-transfusional therapeutical preparations with biological properties applied in tissue regeneration. These BCs differ in the preparation method, in fibrin network architecture, growth factors release as well as in platelet/cell content. Methodological changes result in distinct matrices that can compromise their clinical effectiveness. The present study evaluated the influence of different g-forces and types of tubes in the release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) from platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) as a function of time. The PRF-like samples were obtained with three g-forces (200, 400, and 800 x g) for 10 minutes in pure glass tubes or in polystyrene-clot activator tubes. Scanning and Transmission electron microscopy was used to morphometric analyzes of PRF’s specimens and flow cytometry was used to quantify VEGF slow release until 7 days. Our results showed that platelets were intact and adhered to the fibrin network, emitting pseudopods and in degranulation. The fibrin network was rough and twisted with exosomic granulations impregnated on its surface. An increase in the concentration of VEGF in the PRF supernatant was observed until 7 days for all g forces (200, 400 or 800 xg), with the highest concentrations observed with 200 x g, in both tubes, glass or plastic. Morphological analyzes showed a reduction in the diameter of the PRF fibers after 7 days. Our results showed that g-force interferes with the shape of the fibrin network in the PRF, as well as affect the release of VEGF stored into platelets. This finding may be useful in applying PRF to skin lesions, in which the rapid release of growth factors can favor the tissue repair process. Our observations point to a greater clarification on the methodological variations related to obtaining PRF matrices, as they can generate products with different characteristics and degrees of effectiveness in specific applications."
https://openalex.org/W3092005494,"Background Anxiety could be felt even in objectively peaceful situations, but a vision of conflict could result in increased stress levels. In this article, we aimed to identify hidden patterns of mental conditions and create male profiles to illustrate the different subgroups as well as determinants of anxiety levels among them in accordance with proximity to a possibility of direct exposure to military action. Methods A sample of Ukrainian males, in duty as conscripts to military service (n = 392, M±SD = 22.1±5.3) participated in a survey. We used the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. In addition to psychological indices, social-demographic data were collected. To discover the number of clusters, the k-means algorithm was used, the optimal number of clusters was found by the elbow algorithm. For validation of the model and its use for further prediction, the random forest machine-learning algorithm, was used. Results By performing k-means cluster analyses, 3 subgroups were identified. High values of psychological indices dominated in Subgroup 2, while lowest values dominated in Subgroup 3. Subgroup 1 showed a more even distribution among the indices. The strength of the relevance and main determinants of the prediction of the presented model mostly consisted of mental qualities, while socio-demographic data were slightly significant. Conclusions There is no clear relevance between proximity or even the experience of military actions and anxiety levels. Other factors, mostly subjective feelings about mental conditions, are crucial determinants of feeling anxiety."
https://openalex.org/W3092422524,"Black Americans (BA) have higher incidence and higher mortality rates for colorectal cancers (CRC) as compared to White Americans (WA). While there are several identified risk factors associated with the development of CRC and evidence that high levels of adequate screening can reduce differences in incidence for CRC between BA and WA, there remains little data regarding patient co-morbid contributions towards survival once an individual has CRC. Here we set out to identify patient risk factors that influenced overall survival in a cohort of 293 BA and 348 WA with colon cancer. Amid our cohort, we found that patients' age, tobacco usage, and pre-diagnosed medical conditions such as hypertension and diabetes were associated with shorter overall survival (OS) from colon cancer. We identified pre-diagnosed hypertension and diabetes among BA were responsible for one-third of the colon cancer mortality disparity compared with WA. We also identified long-term regular use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin, was associated with shorter OS from colon cancer among WA >65 years of age, but not younger WA patients or any aged BA patients. Our results raise the importance of not only treating the colon cancer itself, but also taking into consideration co-morbid medical conditions and NSAID usage to enhance patient OS. Further evaluation regarding adequate treatment of co-morbidities and timing of NSAID continuance after cancer therapy will need to be studied."
https://openalex.org/W3092570154,"This study used high throughput, image-based phenotyping (HTP) to distinguish growth patterns, detect facilitation and interpret variations to nutrient uptake in a model mixed-pasture system in response to factorial low and high nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) application. HTP has not previously been used to examine pasture species in mixture. We used red-green-blue (RGB) imaging to obtain smoothed projected shoot area (sPSA) to predict absolute growth (AG) up to 70 days after planting (sPSA, DAP 70), to identify variation in relative growth rates (RGR, DAP 35-70) and detect overyielding (an increase in yield in mixture compared with monoculture, indicating facilitation) in a grass-legume model pasture. Finally, using principal components analysis we interpreted between species changes to HTP-derived temporal growth dynamics and nutrient uptake in mixtures and monocultures. Overyielding was detected in all treatments and was driven by both grass and legume. Our data supported expectations of more rapid grass growth and augmented nutrient uptake in the presence of a legume. Legumes grew more slowly in mixture and where growth became more reliant on soil P. Relative growth rate in grass was strongly associated with shoot N concentration, whereas legume RGR was not strongly associated with shoot nutrients. High throughput, image-based phenotyping was a useful tool to quantify growth trait variation between contrasting species and to this end is highly useful in understanding nutrient-yield relationships in mixed pasture cultivations."
https://openalex.org/W3091953332,"Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is the most common human sarcoma and arises in the gastrointestinal tract. Most GISTs are caused by activating mutations in the KIT receptor tyrosine kinase, such as the exon 11 KIT V559Δ mutation. The small molecule imatinib inhibits KIT and has been a mainstay of therapy in GIST. Unfortunately, imatinib-treated patients typically relapse, most often due to clonal emergence of the resistance-associated KIT V654A mutation. To determine the biologic impact of this second-site mutation in vivo, we created a mouse model with the corresponding V558Δ;V653A Kit double mutation restricted (a) spatially to ETV1+ cells, which include the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) from which GISTs presumably originate, and (b) temporally through tamoxifen treatment after birth. This resulted in the first in vivo model of the most common second-site mutation associated with imatinib resistance in GIST and the first in vivo demonstration that cell-autonomous expression of mutant KIT in the ICC lineage leads to GIST. GISTs driven by the V558Δ;V653A Kit double mutation were resistant to imatinib, while cabozantinib was more effective in overcoming resistance than sunitinib. Compared to control mice with a single V558Δ Kit mutation, mice with a double V558Δ; V653A Kit mutation had increased tumor oncogenesis and associated KIT-dependent STAT activation. Our findings demonstrate that the biologic consequences of a second-site mutation in an oncogenic driver may include not only a mechanism for drug resistance, but changes in tumor oncogenic potential and differential activation of signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W3092094211,"Evaluations of replacement heifers in intensively managed grazing systems in tropical conditions are warranted. Thus, we aimed to evaluate performance, muscle and mammary gland development, oocyte quality, and in vitro production of embryos of crossbred heifers grazing an intensively managed pasture and supplemented with high or low protein concentrates. Eighteen pubertal crossbred heifers (Holstein x Gyr) with an initial weight of 350 ± 8.0 kg were used in a 60-day trial. Two supplement types, 12% crude protein (CP) (S12CP) or 24% CP (S24CP), and a control treatment (mineral mixture, CON) were randomly distributed to the heifers. Throughout the experiment, four digestibility trials were performed over four consecutive days. Four ovarium pick-ups were performed to evaluate oocyte quality and in vitro embryo production. Lastly, ultrasounds of carcasses and mammary glands were performed. The intakes of dry matter (DM), digestible energy (DE), and CP were greater for supplemented (SUP) compared with CON heifers. The SUP heifers had a greater average daily gain (ADG) (645 versus 390 g/d) and rib eye area (58.78 versus 53.32 cm2) than the CON heifers. Oocyte recovery, quality, and follicle features were not affected by supplementation strategy. However, the cleavage rate (47.17% versus 30.31%) and blastocyst rate (27.91% versus 10.12%) were negatively affected by supplementation. The S12CP presented a blastocyst rate much lower than the S24CP (3.02% versus 17.23%). Carcass ultrasonography indicated a trend for greater rib eye area for S24CP and mammary ultrasonography indicated no effects of supplementation on mammary gland development. In summary, supplementation seems to be an appropriate strategy for satisfactory performance, with greater muscle deposition and no negative impacts on mammary gland development. However, in vitro embryo production was impaired when the animals received the supplementation with 12% CP."
https://openalex.org/W3092177649,"Environmental parameters constrain the distributions of plant and animal species. A key question is to what extent does environment influence human behavior. Decreasing linguistic diversity from the equator towards the poles suggests that ecological factors influence linguistic geography. However, attempts to quantify the role of environmental factors in shaping linguistic diversity remain inconclusive. To this end, we apply Ecological Niche Modelling methods to present-day language diversity in New Guinea. We define an Eco-Linguistic Niche (ELN) as the range of environmental conditions present in the territory of a population speaking a specific language or group of languages characterized by common language traits. In order to reconstruct the ELNs, we used Papuan and Austronesian language groups, transformed their geographical distributions into occurrence data, assembled available environmental data for New Guinea, and applied predictive architectures developed in the field of ecology to these data. We find no clear relationship between linguistic diversity and ELNs. This is particularly true when linguistic diversity is examined at the level of language groups. Language groups are variably dependent on environment and generally share their ELN with other language groups. This variability suggests that population dynamics, migration, linguistic drift, and socio-cultural mechanisms must be taken into consideration in order to better understand the myriad factors that shape language diversity."
https://openalex.org/W3092214827,"Social networking sites offer an important means for increasing the accessibility and enabling new forms of health communication between the public and medical social influencers (MSIs). MSIs have a social presence and are perceived as a credible source of health-related information. A research gap, however, exists in understanding the communication strategies employed by MSIs and the factors driving the public to engage in health communication with MSIs. This study, therefore, developed a new conceptual framework incorporating health communication, dialogic and interpersonal communication by employing quantitative content analysis to examine public engagement with MSI communication on the largest microblogging site in China, Sina Weibo. The analysis yielded insights into how the usefulness of health-related information provided alongside the interactive dialogue and affective practices played an active role in engaging the public. The public sought health-related information primarily to address issues of concern for well-being and a high level of engagement in terms of online shares, likes, and comments was found. The use of multimedia made the site more appealing, resulting in likes while the expression of emotions by MSIs generated likes and comments. The need to connect with other online users and have a sense of community was reflected in engagement through sharing useful MSI posts by the public. By identifying influential MSIs on social networking sites, health information providers such as organizations and the government can raise awareness of health issues to foster a healthy lifestyle and contribute to better living in the community."
https://openalex.org/W3091799667,"The direct effects of rising global temperatures on insect herbivores could increase damage to cereal crops. However, the indirect effects of interactions between herbivores and their biotic environment at the same temperatures will potentially counter such direct effects. This study examines the potential for intraspecific competition to dampen the effects of optimal temperatures on fitness (survival × reproduction) of the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens [BPH] and whitebacked planthopper, Sogatella furcifera [WBPH], two phloem-feeders that attack rice in Asia. We conducted a series of experiments with increasing densities of ovipositing females and developing nymphs on tropical and temperate rice varieties at 25, 30 and 35°C. Damage from planthoppers to the tropical variety was greater at 30°C compared to 25°C, despite faster plant growth rates at 30°C. Damage to the temperate variety from WBPH nymphs was greatest at 25°C. BPH nymphs gained greater biomass at 25°C than at 30°C despite faster development at the higher temperature (temperature-size rule); however, the effect was apparent only at high nymph densities. WBPH survival, development rates and nymph weights all declined at ≥ 30°C. At about the optimal temperature for WBPH (25°C), intraspecific crowding reduced nymph weights. Temperature has little effect on oviposition responses to density, and intraspecific competition between females only weakly counters the effects of optimal temperatures on oviposition in both BPH and WBPH. Meanwhile, the deleterious effects of nymph crowding will counter the direct effects of optimal temperatures on voltinism in BPH and on body size in both BPH and WBPH. The negative effects of crowding on BPH nymphs may be decoupled from resource use at higher temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W3092155762,"Melanopic stimuli trigger diverse non-image-forming effects. However, evidence of a melanopic contribution to acute effects on alertness and performance is inconclusive, especially under common lighting situations. Effects on cognitive performance are likely mediated by effort-related physiological changes. We assessed the acute effects of lighting in three scenarios, at two times of day, on effort-related changes to cardiac contraction as indexed by the cardiac pre-ejection period (PEP). In a within-subject design, twenty-seven participants performed a cognitive task thrice during a morning and a late-afternoon session. We set the lighting at 500 lux in all three lighting scenarios, measured horizontally at the desk level, but with 54 lux, 128 lux, or 241 lux melanopic equivalent daylight illuminance at the eye level. Impedance cardiography and electrocardiography measurements were used to calculate PEP, for the baseline and task period. A shorter PEP during the task represents a sympathetic heart activation and therefore increased effort. Data were analysed with linear mixed-effect models. PEP changes depended on both the light scene and time of day (p = 0.01 and p = 0.002, respectively). The highest change (sympathetic activation) occurred for the medium one of the three stimuli (128 lux) during the late-afternoon session. However, effect sizes for the singular effects were small, and only for the combined effect of light and time of day middle-sized. Performance scores or self-reported scores on alertness and task demand did not change with the light scene. In conclusion, participants reached the same performance most efficiently at both the highest and lowest melanopic setting, and during the morning session. The resulting U-shaped relation between melanopic stimulus intensity and PEP is likely not dependent solely on intrinsic ipRGC stimuli, and might be moderated by extrinsic cone input. Since lighting situations were modelled according to current integrative lighting strategies and real-life indoor light intensities, the result has implications for artificial lighting in a work environment."
https://openalex.org/W3092347012,"Individuals from small populations face challenges to initiating reproduction because stochastic demographic processes create local mate scarcity. In response, flexible dispersal patterns that facilitate the movement of individuals across groups have been argued to reduce mate search costs and inbreeding depression. Furthermore, factors that aggregate dispersed peoples, such as rural schools, could lower mate search costs through expansion of mating markets. However, research suggests that dispersal and school attendance are costly to fertility, causing individuals to delay marriage and reproduction. Here, we investigate the role of dispersal and school attendance on marriage and reproductive outcomes using a sample of 54 married couples from four small, dispersed ranching communities in Baja California Sur, Mexico. Our analyses yield three sets of results that challenge conventional expectations. First, we find no evidence that dispersal is associated with later age at marriage or first reproduction for women. For men, dispersal is associated with younger ages of marriage than those who stay in their natal area. Second, in contrast to research suggesting that dispersal decreases inbreeding, we find that female dispersal is associated with an increase in genetic relatedness among marriage partners. This finding suggests that human dispersal promotes female social support from genetic kin in novel locales for raising offspring. Third, counter to typical results on the role of education on reproductive timing, school attendance is associated with younger age at marriage for men and younger age at first birth for women. While we temper causal interpretations and claims of generalizability beyond our study site given our small sample sizes (a feature of small populations), we nonetheless argue that factors like dispersal and school attendance, which are typically associated with delayed reproduction in large population, may actually lower mate search costs in small, dispersed populations with minimal access to labor markets."
https://openalex.org/W3092360580,"Background For population health management, it is important to have health indices that can monitor prevailing health trends in the population. Traditional health indices are generally measurable at different geographical levels with varied number of health dimensions. The aim of this work was to develop and validate a scalable and extendable multi-dimensional health index based on individual data. Methods We defined health to be made up of five different domains: Physical, Mental, Social, Risk, and Healthcare utilization. Item response theory was used to develop models to compute domain scores and a health index. These were normalized to represent an individual’s health percentile relative to the population (0 = worst health, 100 = best health). Data for the models came from a longitudinal health survey on 1,942 participants. The health index was validated using age, frailty, post-survey one-year healthcare utilization and one-year mortality. Results The Spearman rho between the health index and age, frailty and post-survey one-year healthcare utilization were -0.571, -0.561 and -0.435, respectively, with all p<0.001. The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) for post-survey one-year mortality was 0.930. An advantage of the health index is that it can be calculated using different sets of questions and the number of questions can be easily expanded. Conclusion The health index can be used at the individual, program, local, regional or national level to track the state of health of the population. When used together with the domain scores, it can identify regions with poor health and deficiencies within each of the five health domains."
https://openalex.org/W3092643263,"China has made considerable progress with health system reforms in recent years. Rural China, however, has lagged behind as the diversity of needs of China's 3,000 rural counties were not always well addressed by national top-down reforms. China's Rural Health Reform Project Health XI (HXI) piloted a hybrid process of top down and bottom up implementation of health system reforms which were tailored to rural county level needs and covered a population of more than 21 million. Different studies provide evidence that HXI counties have achieved substantial benefits given the relatively limited investment. The Effectiveness of HXI subsequently raises the question how the hybrid approach may have resulted in effective implementation of interventions. We answer this question to advance understanding of hybrid approaches in general and in the rural Chinese context in particular, where the bottom-up elements might match poorly with the traditional organisational culture and learning style.We conducted an in-depth qualitative analysis in three 'best practice' counties, performing document-analyses, observations, semi-structured individual and group interviews. In alignment with the research question, this study is of an explorative nature and follows a sequence of deductive and inductive steps.HXI struggled initially as counties had difficulties to take initiative and autonomously select and adapt their own reforms. The initial reforms required multiple improvement iterations before achieving the planned results. The effectiveness of these bottom up reform processes has been aided by tight top down supervision and extensive domestic expert involvement. County level leadership is seen as essential to align the top down and bottom up structures and processes. Where successful, HXI has changed mind-sets and counties developed generic health improvement capabilities.Tailoring innovations to fit local needs formed a severe challenge for the three 'best practice' counties studied. A 'change of mindset' to actively take initiative and assume autonomy was needed to advance. Top down supervision and extensive support of experts was required to overcome the barriers. The studied counties finally achieved sustainable improvements and developed double loop learning capabilities beyond HXI objectives. Taken together, the above findings suggest that the continuum of healthcare reform implementation approaches in which hybrid approaches reside-from bottom up to top down-has two dimensions: a content dimension and a procedural dimension. Enabled by top down procedures, counties were able to bottom up tailor the content of best practice innovations to fit local needs."

https://openalex.org/W3092539410,"Local flow dynamics play a central role in physiological processes like respiration and nutrient uptake in coral reefs. Despite the importance of corals as hosts to a quarter of all marine life, and the pervasive threats facing corals, characterizing the hydrodynamics between the branches of scleractinian corals has remained a significant challenge. Here, we investigate the effects of colony branch density and surface structure on the local flow field using three-dimensional immersed boundary, large-eddy simulations for four different colony geometries under unidirectional oncoming flow conditions. The first two colonies were from the Pocillopora genus, one with a densely branched geometry, and one with a comparatively loosely branched geometry. The second pair of geometries were derived from a scan of a single Montipora capitata colony, one with the roughness elements called verrucae covering the surface intact, and one with the verrucae removed. For the Pocillopora corals, we found that the mean velocity profiles changed substantially in the center of the dense colony, becoming significantly reduced at middle heights where flow penetration was poor, while the mean velocity profiles in the loosely branched colony remained similar in character from the front to the back of the colony. For the Montipora corals, somewhat counterintuitively, the colony without verrucae produced almost double the maximum Reynolds stress magnitude above the colony compared to the colony without verrucae. This implies that the smooth colony will have enhanced mass transport and higher bed shear stress and friction velocity values relative to the colony with verrucae."
https://openalex.org/W3092599258,"Efforts to mitigate global warming are often justified through calculations of the economic damages that may occur absent mitigation. The earliest such damage estimates were speculative mathematical representations, but some more recent studies provide empirical estimates of damages on economic growth that accumulate over time and result in larger damages than those estimated previously. These heightened damage estimates have been used to suggest that limiting global warming this century to 1.5 °C avoids tens of trillions of 2010 US$ in damage to gross world product relative to limiting global warming to 2.0 °C. However, in order to estimate the net effect on gross world product, mitigation costs associated with decarbonizing the world's energy systems must be subtracted from the benefits of avoided damages. Here, we follow previous work to parameterize the aforementioned heightened damage estimates into a schematic global climate-economy model (DICE) so that they can be weighed against mainstream estimates of mitigation costs in a unified framework. We investigate the net effect of mitigation on gross world product through finite time horizons under a spectrum of exogenously defined levels of mitigation stringency. We find that even under heightened damage estimates, the additional mitigation costs of limiting global warming to 1.5 °C (relative to 2.0 °C) are higher than the additional avoided damages this century under most parameter combinations considered. Specifically, using our central parameter values, limiting global warming to 1.5 °C results in a net loss of gross world product of roughly forty trillion US$ relative to 2 °C and achieving either 1.5 °C or 2.0 °C require a net sacrifice of gross world product, relative to a no-mitigation case, though 2100 with a 3%/year discount rate. However, the benefits of more stringent mitigation accumulate over time and our calculations indicate that stabilizing warming at 1.5 °C or 2.0 °C by 2100 would eventually confer net benefits of thousands of trillions of US$ in gross world product by 2300. The results emphasize the temporal asymmetry between the costs of mitigation and benefits of avoided damages from climate change and thus the long timeframe for which climate change mitigation investment pays off."
https://openalex.org/W3092000041,"Measuring vibration perception threshold (VPT) accurately classifies and quantifies the severity of loss of vibration perception. A biothesiometer (Bio-thesiometer®; Bio Medical Instrument Co, Ohio, USA) appears to be the most suitable tool to determine VPT due to its low inter-rater variability and low occurence of adaption to the sensation. Different VPT values for a biothesiometer have been described, however, specification on age, height and different measurement locations is currently lacking. The objective of our study was to identify determinants of vibration perception in non-diabetic subjects, in order to provide individualized normal values of VPTs for clinical practice. Measurements of the vibration perception were performed on the big toes, insteps, lateral malleoli, and wrists. A total of 205 healthy subjects were included (108 (52.7%) males) with a median [interquartile range] age of 59 [51;64] (range 21–80) years. Mean height was 174.45 ± 9.20 cm and mean weight was 82.94 ± 14.84 kg, resulting in a mean BMI of 27.19 ± 4.00 kg/m2. In stepwise forward linear regression analyses, age (st. β = 0.51, p < 0.001) and height (st. β = 0.43, p < 0.001) were found to be the independent unmodifiable determinants of the VPT at the big toe. Regression coefficients for quantiles of the determinants age and height were incorporated in the corresponding regression equations. This study provides equations to calculate age- and height-specific normal values for VPT that can be used in clinical practice and in large research studies."
https://openalex.org/W3091928564,"Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is released from tumor cells into blood in advanced cancer patients. Although gene mutations in individual tumors can be diverse and heterogenous, ctDNA has the potential to provide comprehensive biomarker information. Here, we performed multi-region sampling (three sites) per resected specimen from 10 gastric cancer patients followed by targeted sequencing and proteomic profiling using reverse-phase protein arrays. A total of 126 non-synonymous mutations were identified from 30 samples from 10 tumors. Of these, 16 (12.7%) were present in all three regions and were designated as founder mutations. Variant allele frequencies (VAFs) of founder mutations were significantly higher than those of non-founder mutations. Phylogenetic analysis also demonstrated a good concordance between founder and truncal mutations, defined as mutations shared by all simulated clones at the trunk of the tumor phylogenetic tree. These findings led us to prioritize founder mutations for quantitative ctDNA monitoring by digital PCR with individually-designed primer/probe sets. In preoperative plasma, the average ctDNA VAF of founder mutations was significantly higher than that of non-founder mutations (p = 0.039). Proteomic heterogeneity was present across the tumor regions both within and between patients independent of mutational status. Our results suggest that, in practice, mutations having high VAF identified without multi-regional sequencing may be immediately useful for quantitative ctDNA monitoring but do not provide sufficient information to predict the proteomic composition of tumors."
https://openalex.org/W3092469936,"Background Repeated practice to acquire expertise could result in the structural and functional changes in relevant brain circuits as a result of long-term potentiation, neurogenesis, glial genesis, and remodeling. Purpose The goal of this study is to use surface-based morphology (SBM) to study cortical thickness differences in Chinese chess experts and novices, and to use regions of cortical thickness differences as seeds to guide a resting state connectivity analysis of the same population. Methods A raw public dataset from Huaxi MR Research Center consisting of 29 Chinese chess experts and 29 novices was used in this study, with both T1-weighted and resting state functional MRI. Surface based morphometry was performed on the T1 images with the Freesurfur pipeline, with a vertex significance threshold of p<0.05 and a cluster false discovery rate of α < 0.05. Regions with significant differences were used in a seed-based comparison of resting state functional connectivity carried out with Statistical Parameter Mapping (SPM) and the Connectivity Toolbox (CONN). Regions of connectivity differences within groups were computed with a voxel significance threshold of p<0.05 and a cluster false discovery rate of α < 0.01. Results Ten regions of the cortex of Chinese chess experts were found to be thinner than chess novices, including regions involved in visual processing, attention, working and episodic memory, and mental imagery, as well as several regions in the prefrontal cortex. There were no regions where experts’ cortices were thicker than novices. Three of the thinner regions exhibited increased functional connectivity to distant brain regions in chess experts. Conclusions Brain regions that are structurally affected by chess training are associated with processes that would likely have a high utility in chess expertise. Using a hierarchical control model, we hypothesize that the functional changes linked with some of these structural changes are related to the professionally trained chess players’ ability to perceive and use contextual information, visuospatial perception, and outcome prediction in the domain of chess, all contributing to their exceptional performance."

Systolic mitral annular excursion (SExc) is also reduced in HCM and must be an intrinsic limitation to the extent of the subsequent motion during diastole. However, the effects of HCM on excursion during early diastole (EDExc) and atrial contraction (AExc), the duration of early diastolic motion (EDDur), and the relationships of EDExc with SExc, and of e`with EDExc and EDDur, are all unknown. Methods The study group was 22 subjects with HCM and there were 22 age and sex matched control subjects. SExc, EDExc, e`, AExc and EDDur were measured from pulsed wave tissue Doppler signals acquired from the septal and lateral walls. In the combined group of HCM and control subjects, multivariate analyses were performed to identify independent predictors of EDExc and e`for both LV walls. Results SExc, EDExc and e`were all lower, and EDDur was longer in the HCM group compared to the control group for both LV walls (p<0.05 for all). In contrast, AExc was lower for the septal wall in the HCM group (p<0.05), but not different between the groups for the lateral wall. In regression analyses of the combined group, EDExc was positively correlated with SExc, and SExc explained 57–86% of the variances in septal and lateral EDExc, e`was positively correlated with EDExc, and EDExc explained 58–68% of the variances of e`, whereas the combination of EDExc with EDDur explained 87–92% of the variances in e`. A diagnosis of HCM was not an independent predictor of EDExc when in combination with SExc, but was a minor contributor to the prediction of e`in combination with EDExc and EDDur. Conclusion In HCM, the decrease in LV longitudinal contraction is the major mechanism accounting for a lower EDExc, the lower e`is accounted for by contributions from the lower EDExc and prolongation of early diastolic motion, and there is no atrial compensation for the reduction of long-axis contraction."
https://openalex.org/W3092627768,"The use of carbon dioxide (CO2) exposure as a means of animal euthanasia has received considerable attention in mammals and birds but remains virtually untested in reptiles. We measured the behavioral responses of four squamate reptile species (Homalopsis buccata, Malayopython reticulatus, Python bivitattus, and Varanus salvator) to exposure to 99.5% CO2 for durations of 15, 30, or 90 minutes. We also examined alterations in plasma corticosterone levels of M. reticulatus and V. salvator before and after 15 minutes of CO2 exposure relative to control individuals. The four reptile taxa showed consistent behavioral responses to CO2 exposure characterized by gaping and minor movements. The time taken to lose responsiveness to stimuli and cessation of movements varied between 240-4260 seconds (4-71 minutes), with considerable intra- and inter-specific variation. Duration of CO2 exposure influenced the likelihood of recovery, which also varied among species (e.g., from 0-100% recovery after 30-min exposure). Plasma corticosterone concentrations increased after CO2 exposure in both V. salvator (18%) and M. reticulatus (14%), but only significantly in the former species. Based on our results, CO2 appears to be a mild stressor for reptiles, but the relatively minor responses to CO2 suggest it may not cause considerable distress or pain. However, our results are preliminary, and further testing is required to understand optimal CO2 delivery mechanisms and interspecific responses to CO2 exposure before endorsing this method for reptile euthanasia."

We investigated the size of pancreatic cancer tumors using multi-plane and 3D reconstructed computed tomography (CT) images and investigated their clinical usefulness. Patients who underwent surgery for pancreatic adenocarcinoma were included. We measured the largest diameter of each pancreatic tumor in the axial, coronal, and sagittal planes of CT images. In addition, maximal diameter and cancer volume were measured from 3D images that were constructed using a semi-automated software system. Final data were compared with pathologic examination and the effect of each value on prognosis was analyzed. A total of 183 patients were analyzed. The maximal diameters measured on the axial, coronal, and sagittal planes were 2.9 ± 1.1, 3.2 ± 0.9, and 3.2 ± 1.0 cm, respectively, which were significantly smaller than pathologic results (3.4 ± 1.4 cm, all p<0.05 by paired t-test). The longest diameter among them (3.4 ± 1.1 cm) was nearly similar to the pathologic diameter. Cancer volume measured on 3D images demonstrated a higher area under the receptor operating characteristic curve [0.714, (95% confidence interval: 0.640-0.788)] for predicting early death compared to any unidimensional CT diameters measured. The longest pancreatic tumor diameter measured on multiplanar CT images was most accurate when compared to its corresponding pathologic diameter. Tumor volume had a stronger correlation with overall survival than tumor diameter."
