https://openalex.org/W2075641736,"The response of the terrestrial carbon cycle to climate change is among the largest uncertainties affecting future climate change projections. The feedback between the terrestrial carbon cycle and climate is partly determined by changes in the turnover time of carbon in land ecosystems, which in turn is an ecosystem property that emerges from the interplay between climate, soil and vegetation type. Here we present a global, spatially explicit and observation-based assessment of whole-ecosystem carbon turnover times that combines new estimates of vegetation and soil organic carbon stocks and fluxes. We find that the overall mean global carbon turnover time is 23(+7)(-4) years (95 per cent confidence interval). On average, carbon resides in the vegetation and soil near the Equator for a shorter time than at latitudes north of 75° north (mean turnover times of 15 and 255 years, respectively). We identify a clear dependence of the turnover time on temperature, as expected from our present understanding of temperature controls on ecosystem dynamics. Surprisingly, our analysis also reveals a similarly strong association between turnover time and precipitation. Moreover, we find that the ecosystem carbon turnover times simulated by state-of-the-art coupled climate/carbon-cycle models vary widely and that numerical simulations, on average, tend to underestimate the global carbon turnover time by 36 per cent. The models show stronger spatial relationships with temperature than do observation-based estimates, but generally do not reproduce the strong relationships with precipitation and predict faster carbon turnover in many semi-arid regions. Our findings suggest that future climate/carbon-cycle feedbacks may depend more strongly on changes in the hydrological cycle than is expected at present and is considered in Earth system models."
https://openalex.org/W2061515205,"The ability to store energy on the electric grid would greatly improve its efficiency and reliability while enabling the integration of intermittent renewable energy technologies (such as wind and solar) into baseload supply. Batteries have long been considered strong candidate solutions owing to their small spatial footprint, mechanical simplicity and flexibility in siting. However, the barrier to widespread adoption of batteries is their high cost. Here we describe a lithium-antimony-lead liquid metal battery that potentially meets the performance specifications for stationary energy storage applications. This Li||Sb-Pb battery comprises a liquid lithium negative electrode, a molten salt electrolyte, and a liquid antimony-lead alloy positive electrode, which self-segregate by density into three distinct layers owing to the immiscibility of the contiguous salt and metal phases. The all-liquid construction confers the advantages of higher current density, longer cycle life and simpler manufacturing of large-scale storage systems (because no membranes or separators are involved) relative to those of conventional batteries. At charge-discharge current densities of 275 milliamperes per square centimetre, the cells cycled at 450 degrees Celsius with 98 per cent Coulombic efficiency and 73 per cent round-trip energy efficiency. To provide evidence of their high power capability, the cells were discharged and charged at current densities as high as 1,000 milliamperes per square centimetre. Measured capacity loss after operation for 1,800 hours (more than 450 charge-discharge cycles at 100 per cent depth of discharge) projects retention of over 85 per cent of initial capacity after ten years of daily cycling. Our results demonstrate that alloying a high-melting-point, high-voltage metal (antimony) with a low-melting-point, low-cost metal (lead) advantageously decreases the operating temperature while maintaining a high cell voltage. Apart from the fact that this finding puts us on a desirable cost trajectory, this approach may well be more broadly applicable to other battery chemistries."
https://openalex.org/W2084866557,"Transmission spectroscopy to date has detected atomic and molecular absorption in Jupiter-sized exoplanets, but intense efforts to measure molecular absorption in the atmospheres of smaller (Neptune-sized) planets during transits have revealed only featureless spectra. From this it was concluded that the majority of small, warm planets evolve to sustain high mean molecular weights, opaque clouds, or scattering hazes in their atmospheres, obscuring our ability to observe the composition of these atmospheres. Here we report observations of the transmission spectrum of HAT-P-11b (~4 Earth radii) from the optical to the infrared. We detected water vapour absorption at 1.4 micrometre wavelength. The amplitude of the water absorption (approximately 250 parts-per- million) indicates that the planetary atmosphere is predominantly clear down to ~1 mbar, and sufficiently hydrogen-rich to exhibit a large scale height. The spectrum is indicative of a planetary atmosphere with an upper limit of ~700 times the abundance of heavy elements relative to solar. This is in good agreement with the core accretion theory of planet formation, in which gas giant planets acquire their atmospheres by directly accreting hydrogen-rich gas from the protoplanetary nebulae onto a large rocky or icy core."

https://openalex.org/W2063180224,"The addition of charcoal (or biochar) to soil has significant carbon sequestration and agronomic potential, making it important to determine how this potentially large anthropogenic carbon influx will alter ecosystem functions. We used column experiments to quantify how hydrologic and nutrient-retention characteristics of three soil materials differed with biochar amendment. We compared three homogeneous soil materials (sand, organic-rich topsoil, and clay-rich Hapludert) to provide a basic understanding of biochar-soil-water interactions. On average, biochar amendment decreased saturated hydraulic conductivity (K) by 92% in sand and 67% in organic soil, but increased K by 328% in clay-rich soil. The change in K for sand was not predicted by the accompanying physical changes to the soil mixture; the sand-biochar mixture was less dense and more porous than sand without biochar. We propose two hydrologic pathways that are potential drivers for this behavior: one through the interstitial biochar-sand space and a second through pores within the biochar grains themselves. This second pathway adds to the porosity of the soil mixture; however, it likely does not add to the effective soil K due to its tortuosity and smaller pore size. Therefore, the addition of biochar can increase or decrease soil drainage, and suggests that any potential improvement of water delivery to plants is dependent on soil type, biochar amendment rate, and biochar properties. Changes in dissolved carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) fluxes also differed; with biochar increasing the C flux from organic-poor sand, decreasing it from organic-rich soils, and retaining small amounts of soil-derived N. The aromaticity of C lost from sand and clay increased, suggesting lost C was biochar-derived; though the loss accounts for only 0.05% of added biochar-C. Thus, the direction and magnitude of hydraulic, C, and N changes associated with biochar amendments are soil type (composition and particle size) dependent."
https://openalex.org/W2078990441,"Retinoblastoma is a childhood retinal tumour that initiates in response to biallelic RB1 inactivation and loss of functional retinoblastoma (Rb) protein. Although Rb has diverse tumour-suppressor functions and is inactivated in many cancers, germline RB1 mutations predispose to retinoblastoma far more strongly than to other malignancies. This tropism suggests that retinal cell-type-specific circuitry sensitizes to Rb loss, yet the nature of the circuitry and the cell type in which it operates have been unclear. Here we show that post-mitotic human cone precursors are uniquely sensitive to Rb depletion. Rb knockdown induced cone precursor proliferation in prospectively isolated populations and in intact retina. Proliferation followed the induction of E2F-regulated genes, and depended on factors having strong expression in maturing cone precursors and crucial roles in retinoblastoma cell proliferation, including MYCN and MDM2. Proliferation of Rb-depleted cones and retinoblastoma cells also depended on the Rb-related protein p107, SKP2, and a p27 downregulation associated with cone precursor maturation. Moreover, Rb-depleted cone precursors formed tumours in orthotopic xenografts with histological features and protein expression typical of human retinoblastoma. These findings provide a compelling molecular rationale for a cone precursor origin of retinoblastoma. More generally, they demonstrate that cell-type-specific circuitry can collaborate with an initiating oncogenic mutation to enable tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1964273058,"Pathogenic mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene have been described as causing early onset familial Alzheimer disease (AD). We recently identified a rare APP variant encoding an alanine-to-threonine substitution at residue 673 (A673T) that confers protection against development of AD (Jonsson, T., Atwal, J.

(2012) Nature 488, 96–99). The Ala-673 residue lies within the β-secretase recognition sequence and is part of the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide cleavage product (position 2 of Aβ). We previously demonstrated that the A673T substitution makes APP a less favorable substrate for cleavage by BACE1. In follow-up studies, we confirm that A673T APP shows reduced cleavage by BACE1 in transfected mouse primary neurons and in isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons. Using a biochemical approach, we show that the A673T substitution modulates the catalytic turnover rate (Vmax) of APP by the BACE1 enzyme, without affecting the affinity (Km) of the APP substrate for BACE1. We also show a reduced level of Aβ(1–42) aggregation with A2T Aβ peptides, an observation not conserved in Aβ(1–40) peptides. When combined in a ratio of 1:9 Aβ(1–42)/Aβ(1–40) to mimic physiologically relevant mixtures, A2T retains a trend toward slowed aggregation kinetics. Microglial uptake of the mutant Aβ(1–42) peptides correlated with their aggregation level. Cytotoxicity of the mutant Aβ peptides was not dramatically altered. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that A673T, a protective allele of APP, reproducibly reduces amyloidogenic processing of APP and also mildly decreases Aβ aggregation. These effects could together have an additive or even synergistic impact on the risk of developing AD.

Identification of genetic variants that protect from AD can be equally informative in revealing the mechanisms underlying disease biology, and they could guide therapeutic approaches to block disease development or progression. Recently, we reported a low frequency variant in the APP gene (rs63750847-A) that confers significant protection against AD (1.Jonsson T. Atwal J.K. Steinberg S. Snaedal J. Jonsson P.V. Bjornsson S.

A mutation in APP protects against Alzheimer's disease and age-related cognitive decline.Nature. 2012; 488: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar). This variant results in an alanine-to-threonine substitution at position 673 in the APP gene (A673T), adjacent to the β-cleavage site. Our primary characterization of the A673T variant demonstrated that this mutation made APP a less favorable substrate for BACE1, resulting in reduced levels of Aβ production (1.Jonsson T. Atwal J.K. Steinberg S. Snaedal J. Jonsson P.V. Bjornsson S. Stefansson H. Sulem P. Gudbjartsson D. Maloney J. Hoyte K. Gustafson A. Liu Y. Lu Y. Bhangale T. Graham R.R. Huttenlocher J. Bjornsdottir G.

A mutation in APP protects against Alzheimer's disease and age-related cognitive decline.Nature. 2012; 488: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar). However, the A673T substitution lies within the Aβ peptide and thus could also alter the properties of the Aβ peptide itself. Here, we examine the effects of this variant on the kinetics of APP processing by BACE1, and additionally, we evaluate the impact of this substitution on Aβ aggregation and biological activity, including microglial uptake and cellular toxicity. Our results provide further support for reduced β-site cleavage of the A673T APP variant and additionally reveal modest alterations in Aβ(1–42) peptide aggregation, as assessed using synthetic peptides. Human APP695 cDNAs encoding WT APP, APP A673T, or APP A673V were transfected into 293T cells maintained in DMEM + 10% FBS as described previously (1.Jonsson T. Atwal J.K. Steinberg S. Snaedal J.

After 4 days in vitro (DIV), cells were lysed using RIPA buffer with Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Applied Science) to assay for β-CTFs. The cell supernatant was also collected to confirm reduced Aβ production. Dissociated cortical neuron cultures (plated at 2.5 × 104 cells/well in a 96-well plate) were prepared from E16.5 C57BL/6J mice. Prior to plating, cells were nucleofected with Amaxa (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) with cDNAs encoding the same human APP695 constructs described above or β-galactosidase (control). After 6 DIV, cells were incubated with 50 µl/well fresh cell medium for 24 h. The medium was collected and used for Aβ ELISA measurements (see below). For both cell types, the efficiency of transfection across different constructs was compared by lysing a separate well of cells with Ambion Cells-to-CTTM (Invitrogen) to assess APP RNA levels by quantitative PCR. Human cortical neurons (catalogue no. DDP-NC-1.0) derived from control donor iPS cells (clone ID 01279.107), the isogenic APP-A673V iPS cells (01279.A32), and the isogenic APP-A673T iPS cells (01279.A27) were ordered from Cellular Dynamics International Inc. (Madison, WI). Human iPSC-derived neurons were plated in 8-well chamber slide (BD 354688) at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well. The culture slides were prepared with poly-d-lysine and laminin following the Cellular Dynamics International user's guide. Half of the conditioned media was replaced with fresh warm media every 2 days. To confirm APP expression, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, 4% sucrose, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and blocked in 2% BSA/PBS. Cells were stained with rabbit monoclonal anti-APP clone Y188 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and mouse anti-MAP2 clone 5F9 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) in 2% BSA/PBS for 2 h. After washing, the secondary goat anti-mouse IgG AlexaFluor®488 antibody A10680 (Invitrogen) and goat anti-rabbit IgG AlexaFluor®568-conjugated antibody A11036 (Invitrogen) were applied for 30 min at 1:200 in 2% BSA/PBS. Media were harvested after 4 DIV for sAPP analysis and after 14 DIV for Aβ measurements. Experiments were performed at least three times, with technical triplicates in each experiment. Cell lysates from transfected 293T cells were run on 4–12% Novex BisTris gels (Invitrogen) for SDS-PAGE analysis. β-CTFs were detected by incubating blots with the C-terminal polyclonal APP antibody A8717 (Sigma) or the monoclonal mid-domain APP antibody 6E10 (Covance, Dedham, MA). Imaging was performed on the Bio-Rad VersaDoc gel imaging system. β-CTFs were quantified using an ELISA from IBL International (catalogue no. 27776, Hamburg, Germany) following the manufacturer's guidelines. Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptides were measured from transfected HEK 293 and primary neuron cell supernatants by sandwich ELISAs as described previously (1.Jonsson T. Atwal J.K. Steinberg S. Snaedal J.

Briefly, rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for the C terminus of Aβ40 or Aβ42 (Millipore, Bedford, MA) was coated onto plates, and biotinylated anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody 6E10 (Covance, Dedham, MA) was used for detection. The assays had a lower limit of quantification values of 6.24 pg/ml for Aβ40 and 18.76 pg/ml for Aβ42. For iPSC-derived neurons, Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptides were measured from cell supernatants using a sandwich electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay (Meso Scale Discovery catalogue no. K15148E, Gaithersburg, MD). Cell supernatants from all cell types were also assayed for sAPP cleavage products by using a sAPPα/sAPPβ multiplex kit (Meso Scale Discovery catalogue no. K15120E). N-terminally biotinylated peptide substrates containing either WT (biotin-KTEEISEVKMDAEFRHDSGYEVHHQKL), A673T (biotin-KTEEISEVKMDTEFRHDSGYEVHHQKL), or A673V (biotin-KTEEISEVKMDVEFRHDSGYEVHHQKL) and similar peptides with the Swedish mutation in combination (biotin-KTEEISEVNLDAEFRHDSGYEVHHQKL, biotin-KTEEISEVNLDTEFRHDSGYEVHHQKL, and biotin-KTEEISEVNLDVEFRHDSGYEVHHQKL) were custom-synthesized by American Peptide Co. Streptavidin-d2 (SA-d2) and anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody 6E10 (Covance, Dedham, MA) labeled with europium cryptate (6E10-Eu) were purchased from CisBio (Bedford, MA). We previously demonstrated that the A673T mutation does not interfere with detection by the 6E10 antibody (1.Jonsson T. Atwal J.K. Steinberg S. Snaedal J. Jonsson P.V. Bjornsson S. Stefansson H.

Enzyme reactions were carried out in 384-well black low volume proxiplate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with 50 nm recombinant human BACE1 ECD (Genentech) and 5 µm peptide substrate in the reaction buffer (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.4, 0.1% CHAPS, 0.1% BSA) at ambient temperature for up to 48 h for non-Swedish peptides and up to 30 min for peptides containing the Swedish mutation. The enzyme reactions were quenched with the addition of equal volume stop buffer (200 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.1% CHAPS, 0.1% BSA). Peptides in the reactions were then further diluted to 300 nm prior to the addition of an equal volume of detection reagent (10 nm anti-Aβ 6E10-Eu, 75 nm SA-d2, 800 mm KF, 200 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.1% CHAPS, 0.1% BSA), and the mixture was incubated at ambient temperature for 1 h. The plates were measured in an EnVision (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) reader, and the TR-FRET ratio with 320 nm excitation, 615 nm donor emission, and 665 nm acceptor emission was calculated as (em665/em615)·Z, where Z = 5000. The reaction progress curves were determined by subtracting background signal at time 0 for each reaction, and reaction rates (min−1) were calculated from linear fits using GraphPad Prism (Sunnyvale, CA). Three FRET peptide substrates, containing WT APP amino acid sequence 668–675 (E(EDANS)EVKMDAEFK(Dabcyl)NH2), A673T (E(EDANS)EVKMDTEFK(Dabcyl) NH2), or A673V (E(EDANS)EVKMDVEFK(Dabcyl)NH2) were custom-synthesized by American Peptide Co. (Sunnyvale, CA). Each peptide was conjugated with a fluorescent donor molecule EDANS at the N terminus and a quencher molecule Dabcyl at the C terminus. The peptide substrates were titrated up to 100 µm in reaction buffer (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.4, 0.1% CHAPS, 0.1% BSA), and the proteolytic reaction was carried out using 50 nm BACE1 at ambient temperature. The enzyme reactions were quenched at various time points up to 48 h with the addition of equal volume stop buffer (200 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.1% CHAPS, 0.1% BSA). Fluorescence intensity at 490 nm with excitation at 340 nm was measured using Tecan M1000 fluorescence reader (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland), and the total fluorescence intensity gain was determined by subtracting background fluorescence at time 0 from the fluorescence intensity of each reaction mixture at different time points. Reaction rates (min−1) were calculated from linear fits of the reaction progress curves, and the Michaelis-Menten equation was applied to determine Km and Vmax values using GraphPad Prism (Sunnyvale, CA). FRET peptide substrate with the Swedish mutation (Rh-EVNLDAEFK-Quencher) was obtained from Invitrogen. Enzyme reactions were carried out with 50 nm BACE1, 150 nm FRET peptide substrate with Swedish mutation, and up to 100 µm biotinylated peptide in reaction buffer (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.4, 0.1% CHAPS, 0.1% BSA) at ambient temperature. Fluorescence intensity (530 nm excitation, 590 nm emission) was continuously monitored for 85 min on a Tecan M1000 fluorescence reader. Initial background signal at each peptide concentration was subtracted from each reaction time. Reaction rates (min−1) were calculated from linear fits, and peptide IC50 values were generated using a four-parameter nonlinear fit in GraphPad Prism. The synthetic peptides (AnaSpec, Fremont, CA) were disaggregated by dissolution in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP), followed by evaporation under a stream of nitrogen. Immediately before analysis, the peptide film was thoroughly dissolved in 10 mm NaOH, neutralized in an equal volume of 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and filtered with a 0.2-µm syringe filter. UV absorbance of the solution at 280 nm was measured, and the peptide concentration was determined using the respective theoretical extinction coefficient and adjusted to 1.0 mg/ml with 5 mm NaOH, 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The redissolved and adjusted peptide solution was transferred into a well of the 96-well plate containing an equal volume of 56 µm thioflavin-T (ThT) in 2 mm NaN3, 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. All data were recorded with a Tecan Safire II reader and black, clear-bottom, and sealed 96-well plates (Corning Glass) in bottom-reading mode at 37 °C. Kinetic reads were taken every 15 min (Aβ(1–40)) or every 10 min (Aβ(1–42) and Aβ(1–42)/Aβ(1–40) mixtures). ThT was excited at 450 nm, and the fluorescence emission signal was read at 490 nm. For each experiment, traces of the mean of three technical replicates were plotted using GraphPad Prism 5, and error bars of the final point indicate standard deviation. Primary microglia were prepared from P2 C57BL/6J mice at a density of 6 × 104 cells per well in 8-well poly-d-lysine-coated chamber slides, and the Aβ uptake assay was performed 48 h later. Aβ(1–40) and Aβ(1–42) peptides were custom-synthesized by rPeptide (Bogart, GA) and prepared as oligomers according to Stine et al. (16.Stine W.B. Jungbauer L. Yu C. LaDu M.J. Preparing synthetic Aβ in different aggregation states.Methods Mol. Biol. 2011; 670: 13-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: peptides were resuspended in 1:10 v/v 1% NH4OH/HFIP to 20 µm and lyophilized overnight. Lyophilized peptides were resuspended in anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) D2650 (Sigma) to 5 mm and immediately diluted to 100 µm in ice-cold cell culture medium (phenol red-free Ham's F-12), vortexed for 30 s, and incubated at 4 °C for 24 h. Peptides were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. 1 µm of Aβ(1–40) or Aβ(1–42) peptides was added to primary microglial cultures. After 90 min, microglia were washed three times with cold PBS, immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 4% sucrose. Cells were then blocked in 2% BSA/PBS and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma catalogue no. 93426-250 ml) for 20 min and stained with mouse anti-Aβ (Covance, Dedham, MA, catalogue no. SIG-39320) at 1:500 and rabbit anti-Iba1 019–19741 (Wako, Osaka, Japan) at 1:200 in 2% BSA/PBS for 2 h. After washing, the secondary goat anti-mouse IgG AlexaFluor®488 antibody A10680 (Invitrogen) and goat anti-rabbit IgG AlexaFluor®568-conjugated antibody A11036 (Invitrogen) were applied for 30 min at 1:200 in 2% BSA/PBS. Immunostained cells were analyzed on a Zeiss 200 M confocal microscope (Thornwood, NY) and processed with Photoshop CS5. To quantify intracellular Aβ uptake by microglia, the area corresponding to intracellular Aβ was delineated using Iba1 staining, and the raw integrated signal intensity was determined per microglia. The quantification was performed using ImageJ software, and values are represented in arbitrary units. 10–20 cells from each condition were quantified in each of three independent experiments, and data from the three experiments were then averaged. Cortical neurons were isolated from E16.5 C57BL/6J mice and plated at a density of 3.5 × 104 cells per well in 96-well poly-d-lysine-coated plates (BD Biosciences). At 6 DIV, cells were treated with freshly prepared Aβ(1–40) or Aβ(1–42) WT, A2T, or A2V synthetic peptides (rPeptide, Bogart, GA) or vehicle. The peptides were initially resuspended in NH4OH/HFIP and lyophilized as described for microglial experiments. Lyophilized peptides were then dissolved in DMSO to generate a 5 mm stock and immediately diluted in culture medium and incubated with cells. After 72 h, cell viability was assessed using the Cell Titer Glo assay, following the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). Experiments were performed three times, with technical triplicates per construct in each experiment. We previously reported that the A673T variant of APP decreases production of the BACE1 cleavage product sAPPβ and both of the amyloidogenic peptides Aβ40 and Aβ42 by ∼40% when overexpressed in HEK 293 cells (1.Jonsson T. Atwal J.K. Steinberg S. Snaedal J. Jonsson P.V. Bjornsson S. Stefansson H. Sulem P. Gudbjartsson D. Maloney J. Hoyte K. Gustafson A. Liu Y. Lu Y. Bhangale T. Graham R.R. Huttenlocher J. Bjornsdottir G. Andreassen O.A. Jönsson E.G. Palotie A. Behrens T.W. Magnusson O.T. Kong A. Thorsteinsdottir U. Watts R.J. Stefansson K. A mutation in APP protects against Alzheimer's disease and age-related cognitive decline.Nature. 2012; 488: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar). To extend these findings, we looked at the production of another APP BACE1 cleavage product, the β-CTF, C99. We transfected HEK 293 cells with APP WT or the protective A673T variant. For comparison, we also examined two pathogenic APP variants, A673V and K670N/M671L (Swedish mutation), which have both been shown to increase Aβ and β-CTF production. We first examined β-CTF production by Western blot analysis of cell lysates using two antibodies as follows: A8717, which detects both α- and β-CTF, and 6E10, which detects only β-CTF (Fig. 1A). CTFs were readily detected in APP-transfected cells and absent in control GFP-transfected cells. As expected, higher levels of β-CTF were seen in cells expressing the pathogenic APP variants A673V or K670N/M671L; conversely, APP A673T reduced β-CTF levels. To quantify these changes, we used a β-CTF ELISA to analyze these cell lysates. A673T reduced β-CTF levels to ∼25% that of WT APP levels (Fig. 1B). This reduction is consistent with the effects of A673T on sAPPβ and Aβ production as we reported previously (1.Jonsson T. Atwal J.K. Steinberg S. Snaedal J. Jonsson P.V. Bjornsson S. Stefansson H. Sulem P. Gudbjartsson D. Maloney J. Hoyte K. Gustafson A. Liu Y. Lu Y. Bhangale T. Graham R.R. Huttenlocher J. Bjornsdottir G. Andreassen O.A. Jönsson E.G. Palotie A. Behrens T.W. Magnusson O.T.

A mutation in APP protects against Alzheimer's disease and age-related cognitive decline.Nature. 2012; 488: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar). Our findings thus far have focused on APP processing in the HEK 293 cell line. To confirm that A673T had similar effects on APP processing by BACE1 in neurons, we performed experiments in cultured primary mouse cortical neurons. Cultured neurons were transfected with cDNA encoding human APP WT, the protective A673T variant, the pathogenic APP A673V variant, or a control vector expressing β-gal. All constructs expressed APP at similar levels, as confirmed by quantitative PCR (data not shown). We assessed the formation of APP cleavage products Aβ40, Aβ42, sAPPβ, and sAPPα in the media of transfected cells. Our assays were designed to specifically detect cleavage products from transfected human APP constructs and did not detect endogenous mouse APP cleavage products. Similar to what was observed in HEK 293 cells, we found that the A673T APP variant generated less Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptides as compared with WT APP (Fig. 1, C and D). Aβ40 was reduced by 38 (±25)% and Aβ42 by 35 (±10)%. APP A673V increased Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels by ∼2.5-fold. Immunoassay analysis for sAPPβ and sAPPα in cell supernatants (Fig. 1E) showed that the A673T APP variant reduced the ratio of sAPPβ relative to sAPPα when compared with WT APP by 49 (±5)%. Conversely, the pathogenic APP A673V variant robustly increased the sAPPβ/sAPPα ratio."
https://openalex.org/W2076309706,"Missense mutations in alanine 673 of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which corresponds to the second alanine of the amyloid β (Aβ) sequence, have dramatic impact on the risk for Alzheimer disease; A2V is causative, and A2T is protective. Assuming a crucial role of amyloid-Aβ in neurodegeneration, we hypothesized that both A2V and A2T mutations cause distinct changes in Aβ properties that may at least partially explain these completely different phenotypes. Using human APP-overexpressing primary neurons, we observed significantly decreased Aβ production in the A2T mutant along with an enhanced Aβ generation in the A2V mutant confirming earlier data from non-neuronal cell lines. More importantly, thioflavin T fluorescence assays revealed that the mutations, while having little effect on Aβ42 peptide aggregation, dramatically change the properties of the Aβ40 pool with A2V accelerating and A2T delaying aggregation of the Aβ peptides. In line with the kinetic data, Aβ A2T demonstrated an increase in the solubility at equilibrium, an effect that was also observed in all mixtures of the A2T mutant with the wild type Aβ40. We propose that in addition to the reduced β-secretase cleavage of APP, the impaired propensity to aggregate may be part of the protective effect conferred by A2T substitution. The interpretation of the protective effect of this mutation is thus much more complicated than proposed previously."
https://openalex.org/W1967837646,"Objective Our aim was to replicate and extend the recently found association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and ADHD symptoms in school-age children. Methods Participants were members of the Auckland Birthweight Collaborative Study, a longitudinal study of 871 infants of European descent sampled disproportionately for small for gestational age. Drug use during pregnancy (acetaminophen, aspirin, antacids, and antibiotics) were analysed in relation to behavioural difficulties and ADHD symptoms measured by parent report at age 7 and both parent- and child-report at 11 years of age. The analyses included multiple covariates including birthweight, socioeconomic status and antenatal maternal perceived stress. Results Acetaminophen was used by 49.8% of the study mothers during pregnancy. We found significantly higher total difficulty scores (Strengths and Difficulty Questionnaire parent report at age 7 and child report at age 11) if acetaminophen was used during pregnancy, but there were no significant differences associated with any of the other drugs. Children of mothers who used acetaminophen during pregnancy were also at increased risk of ADHD at 7 and 11 years of age (Conners’ Parent Rating Scale-Revised). Conclusions These findings strengthen the contention that acetaminophen exposure in pregnancy increases the risk of ADHD-like behaviours. Our study also supports earlier claims that findings are specific to acetaminophen."
https://openalex.org/W2004005433,"The formation of branched lariat RNA is an evolutionarily conserved feature of splicing reactions for both group II and spliceosomal introns. The lariat is important for the fidelity of 5′ splice-site selection and consists of a 2′-5′ phosphodiester bond between a bulged adenosine and the 5′ end of the intron. To gain insight into this ubiquitous intramolecular linkage, we determined the crystal structure of a eukaryotic group IIB intron in the lariat form at 3.7 Å. This revealed that two tandem tetraloop-receptor interactions, η–η′ and π–π′, place domain VI in the core to position the lariat bond in the post-catalytic state. On the basis of structural and biochemical data, we propose that π–π′ is a dynamic interaction that mediates the transition between the two steps of splicing, with η–η′ serving an ancillary role. The structure also reveals a four-magnesium-ion cluster involved in both catalysis and positioning of the 5′ end. Given the evolutionary relationship between group II and nuclear introns, it is likely that this active site configuration exists in the spliceosome as well. This study determines the structure of a branched lariat RNA, providing insights into rearrangement of the intron between the two steps of RNA splicing. The first step of RNA splicing involves the formation of a lariat or noose-like structure, in a process that is autocatalytic. This results from an incision at one end of the intron, followed by formation of a 2′-5′ phosophodiester linkage. Navtej Toor and colleagues have now solved the structure of this branched intermediate, revealing details of the rearrangement of the structure between the two steps of splicing. The core contains four magnesium ions that organize the substrate and facilitate lariat formation. These data on a group II intron are also relevant to the action of the spliceosome."
https://openalex.org/W2007379492,"A conserved tyrosine residue, Tyr 57, of histone H2A is phosphorylated by an unsuspected tyrosine kinase activity of casein kinase 2, influencing a series of histone marks associated with active transcription and regulating transcription elongation. Post-translational modifications to histones are involved in regulating various nuclear processes, including transcription. Here, Michael Rosenfeld and colleagues find that a conserved tyrosine residue, Y57, in the globular domain of histone H2A is phosphorylated by an unsuspected tyrosine kinase activity of casein kinase 2 (CK2). This modification affects a series of histone marks associated with active transcription and has a role during transcription elongation. Post-translational histone modifications have a critical role in regulating transcription, the cell cycle, DNA replication and DNA damage repair1. The identification of new histone modifications critical for transcriptional regulation at initiation, elongation or termination is of particular interest. Here we report a new layer of regulation in transcriptional elongation that is conserved from yeast to mammals. This regulation is based on the phosphorylation of a highly conserved tyrosine residue, Tyr 57, in histone H2A and is mediated by the unsuspected tyrosine kinase activity of casein kinase 2 (CK2). Mutation of Tyr 57 in H2A in yeast or inhibition of CK2 activity impairs transcriptional elongation in yeast as well as in mammalian cells. Genome-wide binding analysis reveals that CK2α, the catalytic subunit of CK2, binds across RNA-polymerase-II-transcribed coding genes and active enhancers. Mutation of Tyr 57 causes a loss of H2B mono-ubiquitination as well as H3K4me3 and H3K79me3, histone marks associated with active transcription. Mechanistically, both CK2 inhibition and the H2A(Y57F) mutation enhance H2B deubiquitination activity of the Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex, suggesting a critical role of this phosphorylation in coordinating the activity of the SAGA complex during transcription. Together, these results identify a new component of regulation in transcriptional elongation based on CK2-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the globular domain of H2A."

To guide mothers in breastfeeding, it is important to know when preterm infants can initiate breastfeeding and progress. The aim was to analyse postmenstrual age (PMA) at breastfeeding milestones in different preterm gestational age (GA) groups, to describe rates of breastfeeding duration at pre-defined times, as well as analyse factors associated with PMA at the establishment of exclusive breastfeeding.The study was part of a prospective survey of a national Danish cohort of preterm infants based on questionnaires and structured telephone interviews, including 1,221 mothers and their 1,488 preterm infants with GA of 24-36 weeks.Of the preterm infants, 99% initiated breastfeeding and 68% were discharged exclusively breastfed. Breastfeeding milestones were generally reached at different PMAs for different GA groups, but preterm infants were able to initiate breastfeeding at early times, with some delay in infants less than GA 32 weeks. Very preterm infants had lowest mean PMA (35.5 weeks) at first complete breastfeed, and moderate preterm infants had lowest mean PMA at the establishment of exclusive breastfeeding (36.4 weeks). Admitting mothers to the NICU together with the infant and minimising the use of a pacifier during breastfeeding transition were associated with 1.6 (95% CI 0.4-2.8) and 1.2 days (95% CI 0.1-2.3) earlier establishment of exclusive breastfeeding respectively. Infants that were small for gestational age were associated with 5.6 days (95% CI 4.1-7.0) later establishment of exclusive breastfeeding.Breastfeeding competence is not developed at a fixed PMA, but is influenced by multiple factors in infants, mothers and clinical practice. Admitting mothers together with their infants to the NICU and minimising the use of pacifiers may contribute to earlier establishment of exclusive breastfeeding."

https://openalex.org/W2046538549,"Single-molecular-interaction-sequencing involves attaching DNA barcodes to proteins, assaying these barcoded proteins en masse in an aqueous solution, followed by immobilization in a polyacrylamide film and amplifying and analysing the barcoding DNAs—the method allows for precise protein quantification and simultaneous interrogation of molecular binding affinity and specificity. George Church and colleagues have developed a single-molecular-interaction sequencing (SMI-seq) technology for parallel protein interaction profiling that harnesses the power of single-molecule DNA approaches for protein functional analysis. SMI-seq works by coupling proteins to DNA identifiers or 'barcodes' through ribosome display or enzymatic conjugation. These barcoded proteins are then assayed en masse in aqueous solution and immobilized in a polyacrylamide film. Barcoding DNAs are then amplified and analysed by DNA sequencing. The method allows precise protein quantification and simultaneous interrogation of molecular binding affinity and specificity. In contrast with advances in massively parallel DNA sequencing1, high-throughput protein analyses2,3,4 are often limited by ensemble measurements, individual analyte purification and hence compromised quality and cost-effectiveness. Single-molecule protein detection using optical methods5 is limited by the number of spectrally non-overlapping chromophores. Here we introduce a single-molecular-interaction sequencing (SMI-seq) technology for parallel protein interaction profiling leveraging single-molecule advantages. DNA barcodes are attached to proteins collectively via ribosome display6 or individually via enzymatic conjugation. Barcoded proteins are assayed en masse in aqueous solution and subsequently immobilized in a polyacrylamide thin film to construct a random single-molecule array, where barcoding DNAs are amplified into in situ polymerase colonies (polonies)7 and analysed by DNA sequencing. This method allows precise quantification of various proteins with a theoretical maximum array density of over one million polonies per square millimetre. Furthermore, protein interactions can be measured on the basis of the statistics of colocalized polonies arising from barcoding DNAs of interacting proteins. Two demanding applications, G-protein coupled receptor and antibody-binding profiling, are demonstrated. SMI-seq enables ‘library versus library’ screening in a one-pot assay, simultaneously interrogating molecular binding affinity and specificity."

https://openalex.org/W2049659786,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, fatal disease, thought to be largely transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) driven, for which there is no effective therapy. We assessed the potential benefits in IPF of nitrated fatty acids (NFAs), which are unique endogenous agonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), a nuclear hormone receptor that exhibits wound-healing and antifibrotic properties potentially useful for IPF therapy. We found that pulmonary PPARγ is down-regulated in patients with IPF. In vitro, knockdown or knockout of PPARγ expression in isolated human and mouse lung fibroblasts induced a profibrotic phenotype, whereas treating human fibroblasts with NFAs up-regulated PPARγ and blocked TGFβ signaling and actions. NFAs also converted TGFβ to inactive monomers in cell-free solution, suggesting an additional mechanism through which they may inhibit TGFβ. In vivo, treating mice bearing experimental pulmonary fibrosis with NFAs reduced disease severity. Also, NFAs up-regulated the collagen-targeting factor milk fat globule-EGF factor 8 (MFG-E8), stimulated collagen uptake and degradation by alveolar macrophages, and promoted myofibroblast dedifferentiation. Moreover, treating mice with established pulmonary fibrosis using NFAs reversed their existing myofibroblast differentiation and collagen deposition. These findings raise the prospect of treating IPF with NFAs to halt and perhaps even reverse the progress of IPF.—Reddy, A. T., Lakshmi, S. P., Zhang, Y., Reddy, R.

https://openalex.org/W2035616558,"Use of fluorescent proteins to study in vivo processes in mammals requires near-infrared (NIR) biomarkers that exploit the ability of light in this range to penetrate tissue. Bacteriophytochromes (BphPs) are photoreceptors that couple absorbance of NIR light to photoisomerization, protein conformational changes, and signal transduction. BphPs have been engineered to form NIR fluorophores, including IFP1.4, Wi-Phy, and the iRFP series, initially by replacement of Asp-207 by His. This position was suggestive because its main chain carbonyl is within hydrogen-bonding distance to pyrrole ring nitrogens of the biliverdin chromophore, thus potentially functioning as a crucial transient proton sink during photoconversion. To explain the origin of fluorescence in these phytofluors, we solved the crystal structures of IFP1.4 and a comparison non-fluorescent monomeric phytochrome DrCBDmon. Met-186 and Val-288 in IFP1.4 are responsible for the formation of a tightly packed hydrophobic hub around the biliverdin D ring. Met-186 is also largely responsible for the blue-shifted IFP1.4 excitation maximum relative to the parent BphP. The structure of IFP1.4 revealed decreased structural heterogeneity and a contraction of two surface regions as direct consequences of side chain substitutions. Unexpectedly, IFP1.4 with Asp-207 reinstalled (IFPrev) has a higher fluorescence quantum yield (∼9%) than most NIR phytofluors published to date. In agreement, fluorescence lifetime measurements confirm the exceptionally long excited state lifetimes, up to 815 ps, in IFP1.4 and IFPrev. Our research helps delineate the origin of fluorescence in engineered BphPs and will facilitate the wide-spread adoption of phytofluors as biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W1973740991,"Adipocyte lipolysis can increase the production of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) that promote insulin resistance. However, the mechanisms that link lipolysis with inflammation remain elusive. Acute activation of β3-adrenergic receptors (ADRB3) triggers lipolysis and up-regulates production of IL-6 in adipocytes, and both of these effects are blocked by pharmacological inhibition of hormone-sensitive lipase. We report that stimulation of ADRB3 induces expression of sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) and increases sphingosine 1-phosphate production in adipocytes in a manner that also depends on hormone-sensitive lipase activity. Mechanistically, we found that adipose lipolysis-induced SphK1 up-regulation is mediated by the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/activating protein-1 signaling pathway. Inhibition of SphK1 by sphingosine kinase inhibitor 2 diminished the ADRB3-induced IL-6 production both in vitro and in vivo. Induction of IL-6 by ADRB3 activation was suppressed by siRNA knockdown of Sphk1 in cultured adipocytes and was severely attenuated in Sphk1 null mice. Conversely, ectopic expression of SphK1 increased IL-6 expression in adipocytes. Collectively, these data demonstrate that SphK1 is a critical mediator in lipolysis-triggered inflammation in adipocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1991457939,"Although it is known that lysosomal cysteine cathepsins require a reducing environment for optimal activity, it is not firmly established how these enzymes are maintained in their reduced-active state in the acidic and occasionally oxidative environment within phagosomes and lysosomes. γ-Interferon-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT) has been the only enzyme described in the endosomes, lysosomes, and phagosomes with the potential to catalyze the reduction of cysteine cathepsins. Our goal in the current study was to assess the effect of GILT on major phagosomal functions with an emphasis on proteolytic efficiency in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages. Assessment of phagosomal disulfide reduction upon internalization of IgG-opsonized experimental particles confirmed a major role for GILT in phagosomal disulfide reduction in both resting and interferon-γ-activated macrophages. Furthermore we observed a decrease in early phagosomal proteolytic efficiency in GILT-deficient macrophages, specifically in the absence of an NADPH oxidase-mediated respiratory burst. This deficiency was more prominent in IL-4-activated macrophages that inherently possess lower levels of NADPH oxidase activity. Finally, we provide evidence that GILT is required for optimal activity of the lysosomal cysteine protease, cathepsin S. In summary, our results suggest a role for GILT in maintaining cysteine cathepsin proteolytic efficiency in phagosomes, particularly in the absence of high NADPH oxidase activity, which is characteristic of alternatively activated macrophages."

https://openalex.org/W2040569081,"Clostridium botulinum (group III), Clostridium novyi and Clostridium haemolyticum are well-known pathogens causing animal botulism, gas gangrene/black disease, and bacillary hemoglobinuria, respectively. A close genetic relationship exists between the species, which has resulted in the collective term C. novyi sensu lato. The pathogenic traits in these species, e.g., the botulinum neurotoxin and the novyi alpha toxin, are mainly linked to a large plasmidome consisting of plasmids and circular prophages. The plasmidome of C. novyi sensu lato has so far been poorly characterized. In this study we explored the genomic relationship of a wide range of strains of C. novyi sensu lato with a special focus on the dynamics of the plasmidome. Twenty-four genomes were sequenced from strains selected to represent as much as possible the genetic diversity in C. novyi sensu lato. Sixty-one plasmids were identified in these genomes and 28 of them were completed. The genomic comparisons revealed four separate lineages, which did not strictly correlate with the species designations. The plasmids were categorized into 13 different plasmid groups on the basis of their similarity and conservation of plasmid replication or partitioning genes. The plasmid groups, lineages and species were to a large extent entwined because plasmids and toxin genes had moved across the lineage boundaries. This dynamic process appears to be primarily driven by phages. We here present a comprehensive characterization of the complex species group C. novyi sensu lato, explaining the intermixed genetic properties. This study also provides examples how the reorganization of the botulinum toxin and the novyi alpha toxin genes within the plasmidome has affected the pathogenesis of the strains."

However, as ongoing advances are rapidly yielding increasing read lengths, a technical hurdle remains in identifying the degree to which differences in read length influence various transcriptome analyses. In this study, we generated two paired-end RNA-seq datasets of differing read lengths (2×75 bp and 2×262 bp) for lymphoblastoid cell line GM12878 and compared the effect of read length on transcriptome analyses, including read-mapping performance, gene and transcript quantification, and detection of allele-specific expression (ASE) and allele-specific alternative splicing (ASAS) patterns. Our results indicate that, while the current long-read protocol is considerably more expensive than short-read sequencing, there are important benefits that can only be achieved with longer read length, including lower mapping bias and reduced ambiguity in assigning reads to genomic elements, such as mRNA transcript. We show that these benefits ultimately lead to improved detection of cis-acting regulatory and splicing variation effects within individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2030276408,"Microtubule-stabilizing agents, such as paclitaxel (Taxol), are effective chemotherapy drugs for treating many cancers, and painful neuropathy is a major dose-limiting adverse effect. Cation-chloride cotransporters, such as Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) cotransporter-1 (NKCC1) and K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter-2 (KCC2), critically influence spinal synaptic inhibition by regulating intracellular chloride concentrations. Here we show that paclitaxel treatment in rats significantly reduced GABA-induced membrane hyperpolarization and caused a depolarizing shift in GABA reversal potential of dorsal horn neurons. However, paclitaxel had no significant effect on AMPA or NMDA receptor-mediated glutamatergic input from primary afferents to dorsal horn neurons. Paclitaxel treatment significantly increased protein levels, but not mRNA levels, of NKCC1 in spinal cords. Inhibition of NKCC1 with bumetanide reversed the paclitaxel effect on GABA-mediated hyperpolarization and GABA reversal potentials. Also, intrathecal bumetanide significantly attenuated hyperalgesia and allodynia induced by paclitaxel. Co-immunoprecipitation revealed that NKCC1 interacted with β-tubulin and β-actin in spinal cords. Remarkably, paclitaxel increased NKCC1 protein levels at the plasma membrane and reduced NKCC1 levels in the cytosol of spinal cords. In contrast, treatment with an actin-stabilizing agent had no significant effect on NKCC1 protein levels in the plasma membrane or cytosolic fractions of spinal cords. In addition, inhibition of the motor protein dynein blocked paclitaxel-induced subcellular redistribution of NKCC1, whereas inhibition of kinesin-5 mimicked the paclitaxel effect. Our findings suggest that increased NKCC1 activity contributes to diminished spinal synaptic inhibition and neuropathic pain caused by paclitaxel. Paclitaxel disrupts intracellular NKCC1 trafficking by interfering with microtubule dynamics and associated motor proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1996260153,"Ecological engineering for pest management involves the identification of optimal forms of botanical diversity to incorporate into a farming system to suppress pests, by promoting their natural enemies. Whilst this approach has been extensively researched in many temperate crop systems, much less has been done for rice. This paper reports the influence of various plant species on the performance of a key natural enemy of rice planthopper pests, the predatory mirid bug, Cyrtorhinus lividipennis. Survival of adult males and females was increased by the presence of flowering Tagetes erecta, Trida procumbens, Emilia sonchifolia (Compositae), and Sesamum indicum (Pedaliaceae) compared with water or nil controls. All flower treatments resulted in increased consumption of brown plant hopper, Nilaparvata lugens, and for female C. lividipennis, S. indicum was the most favorable. A separate study with a wider range of plant species and varying densities of prey eggs showed that S. indicum most strongly promoted predation by C. lividipennis. Reflecting this, S. indicum gave a relatively high rate of prey search and low prey handling time. On this basis, S. indicum was selected for more detailed studies to check if its potential incorporation into the farming system would not inadvertently benefit Cnaphalocrocis medinalis and Marasmia patnalis, serious Lepidoptera pests of rice. Adult longevity and fecundity of both pests was comparable for S. indicum and water treatments and significantly lower than the honey solution treatment. Findings indicate that S. indicumis well suited for use as an ecological engineering plant in the margins of rice crops. Sesame indicum can be a valuable crop as well as providing benefits to C. lividipennis whilst denying benefit to key pests."
https://openalex.org/W2044524666,"Renal fibrosis is responsible for progressive renal diseases that cause chronic renal failure. Sfrp1 (secreted Frizzled-related protein 1) is highly expressed in kidney, although little is known about connection between the protein and renal diseases. Here, we focused on Sfrp1 to investigate its roles in renal fibrosis using a mouse model of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). In wild-type mice, the expression of Sfrp1 protein was markedly increased after UUO. The kidneys from Sfrp1 knock-out mice showed significant increase in expression of myofibrobast markers, α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA). Sfrp1 deficiency also increased protein levels of the fibroblast genes, vimentin, and decreased those of the epithelial genes, E-cadherin, indicated that enhanced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. There was no difference in the levels of canonical Wnt signaling; rather, the levels of phosphorylated c-Jun and JNK were more increased in the Sfrp1(-/-) obstructed kidney. Moreover, the apoptotic cell population was significantly elevated in the obstructed kidneys from Sfrp1(-/-) mice following UUO but was slightly increased in those from wild-type mice. These results indicate that Sfrp1 is required for inhibition of renal damage through the non-canonical Wnt/PCP pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2157529914,"Color research has shown that red is associated with avoidance of threat (e.g., failure) or approach of reward (e.g., mating) depending on the context in which it is perceived. In the present study we explored one central cognitive process that might be involved in the context dependency of red associations. According to our theory, red is supposed to highlight the relevance (importance) of a goal-related stimulus and correspondingly intensifies the perceivers' attentional reaction to it. Angry and happy human compared to non-human facial expressions were used as goal-relevant stimuli. The data indicate that the color red leads to enhanced attentional engagement to angry and happy human facial expressions (compared to neutral ones) - the use of non-human facial expressions does not bias attention. The results are discussed with regard to the idea that red induced attentional biases might explain the red-context effects on motivation."
https://openalex.org/W2029297764,"Aberrant expression of hedgehog molecules, particularly Gli1, is common in cancers of many tissues and is responsible for their aggressive behavior and chemoresistance. Here we demonstrate a novel and tumor-specific role for aberrant Gli1 in the regulation of the S-phase checkpoint that suppresses replication stress and resistance to chemotherapy. Inhibition of Gli1 in tumor cells induced replication stress-mediated DNA damage response, attenuated their clonogenic potential, abrogated camptothecin (CPT)-induced Chk1 phosphorylation, and potentiated its cytotoxicity. However, in normal fibroblasts, Gli1 siRNAs showed no significant changes in CPT-induced Chk1 phosphorylation. Further analysis of ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR)/Chk1 signaling cascade genes in tumor cells revealed an unexpected mechanism whereby Gli1 regulates ATR-mediated Chk1 phosphorylation by transcriptional regulation of the BH3-only protein Bid. Consistent with its role in DNA damage response, Bid down-regulation in tumor cells abolished CPT-induced Chk1 phosphorylation and sensitized them to CPT. Correspondingly, Gli1 inhibition affected the expression of Bid and the association of replication protein A (RPA) with the ATR- interacting protein (ATRIP)-ATR complex, and this compromised the S-phase checkpoint. Conversely, complementation of Bid in Gli1-deficient cells restored CPT-induced Chk1 phosphorylation. An in silico analysis of the Bid promoter identified a putative Gli1 binding site, and further studies using luciferase reporter assays confirmed Gli1-dependent promoter activity. Collectively, our studies established a novel connection between aberrant Gli1 and Bid in the survival of tumor cells and their response to chemotherapy, at least in part, by regulating the S-phase checkpoint. Importantly, our data suggest a novel drug combination of Gli1 and Top1 inhibitors as an effective therapeutic strategy in treating tumors that expresses Gli1."
https://openalex.org/W1963931438,"The biologically and clinically important membrane transporters are challenging proteins to study because of their low level of expression, multidomain structure, and complex molecular dynamics that underlies their activity. ATP7B is a copper transporter that traffics between the intracellular compartments in response to copper elevation. The N-terminal domain of ATP7B (N-ATP7B) is involved in binding copper, but the role of this domain in trafficking is controversial. To clarify the role of N-ATP7B, we generated nanobodies that interact with ATP7B in vitro and in cells. In solution NMR studies, nanobodies revealed the spatial organization of N-ATP7B by detecting transient functionally relevant interactions between metal-binding domains 1-3. Modulation of these interactions by nanobodies in cells enhanced relocalization of the endogenous ATP7B toward the plasma membrane linking molecular and cellular dynamics of the transporter. Stimulation of ATP7B trafficking by nanobodies in the absence of elevated copper provides direct evidence for the important role of N-ATP7B structural dynamics in regulation of ATP7B localization in a cell."
https://openalex.org/W1971003964,"This paper introduces a strategy to kill selectively multidrug-resistant cells that express the ABCG2 transporter (also called breast cancer resistance protein, or BCRP). The approach is based on specific stimulation of ATP hydrolysis by ABCG2 transporters with subtoxic doses of curcumin combined with stimulation of ATP hydrolysis by Na+,K+-ATPase with subtoxic doses of gramicidin A or ouabain. After 72 h of incubation with the drug combinations, the resulting overconsumption of ATP by both pathways inhibits the efflux activity of ABCG2 transporters, leads to depletion of intracellular ATP levels below the viability threshold, and kills resistant cells selectively over cells that lack ABCG2 transporters. This strategy, which was also tested on a clinically relevant human breast adenocarcinoma cell line (MCF-7/FLV1), exploits the overexpression of ABCG2 transporters and induces caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death selectively in resistant cells. This work thus introduces a novel strategy to exploit collateral sensitivity (CS) with a combination of two clinically used compounds that individually do not exert CS. Collectively, this work expands the current knowledge on ABCG2-mediated CS and provides a potential strategy for discovery of CS drugs against drug-resistant cancer cells.

https://openalex.org/W2007878738,"The molecular chaperone ClpB/Hsp104, a member of the AAA+ superfamily (ATPases associated with various cellular activities), rescues proteins from the aggregated state in collaboration with the DnaK/Hsp70 chaperone system. ClpB/Hsp104 forms a hexameric, ring-shaped complex that functions as a tightly regulated, ATP-powered molecular disaggregation machine. Highly conserved and essential arginine residues, often called arginine fingers, are located at the subunit interfaces of the complex, which also harbor the catalytic sites. Several AAA+ proteins, including ClpB/Hsp104, possess a pair of such trans-acting arginines in the N-terminal nucleotide binding domain (NBD1), both of which were shown to be crucial for oligomerization and ATPase activity. Here, we present a mechanistic study elucidating the role of this conserved arginine pair. First, we found that the arginines couple nucleotide binding to oligomerization of NBD1, which is essential for the activity. Next, we designed a set of covalently linked, dimeric ClpB NBD1 variants, carrying single subunits deficient in either ATP binding or hydrolysis, to study allosteric regulation and intersubunit communication. Using this well defined environment of site-specifically modified, cross-linked AAA+ domains, we found that the conserved arginine pair mediates the cooperativity of ATP binding and hydrolysis in an allosteric fashion."
https://openalex.org/W1991516734,"IL-22 is a Th17/Th22 cytokine that is increased in asthma. However, recent animal studies showed controversial findings in the effects of IL-22 in allergic asthma. To determine the role of IL-22 in ovalbumin-induced allergic inflammation we generated inducible lung-specific IL-22 transgenic mice. Transgenic IL-22 expression and signaling activity in the lung were determined. Ovalbumin (OVA)-induced pulmonary inflammation, immune responses, and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) were examined and compared between IL-22 transgenic mice and wild type controls. Following doxycycline (Dox) induction, IL-22 protein was readily detected in the large (CC10 promoter) and small (SPC promoter) airway epithelial cells. IL-22 signaling was evidenced by phosphorylated STAT3. After OVA sensitization and challenge, compared to wild type littermates, IL-22 transgenic mice showed decreased eosinophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and in lung tissue, decreased mucus metaplasia in the airways, and reduced AHR. Among the cytokines and chemokines examined, IL-13 levels were reduced in the BAL fluid as well as in lymphocytes from local draining lymph nodes of IL-22 transgenic mice. No effect was seen on the levels of serum total or OVA-specific IgE or IgG. These findings indicate that IL-22 has immune modulatory effects on pulmonary inflammatory responses in allergen-induced asthma."
https://openalex.org/W1986102322,"Perception, cognition, and emotion do not operate along segregated pathways; rather, their adaptive interaction is supported by various sources of evidence. For instance, the aesthetic appraisal of powerful mood inducers like music can bias the facial expression of emotions towards mood congruency. In four experiments we showed similar mood-congruency effects elicited by the comfort/discomfort of body actions. Using a novel Motor Action Mood Induction Procedure, we let participants perform comfortable/uncomfortable visually-guided reaches and tested them in a facial emotion identification task. Through the alleged mediation of motor action induced mood, action comfort enhanced the quality of the participant's global experience (a neutral face appeared happy and a slightly angry face neutral), while action discomfort made a neutral face appear angry and a slightly happy face neutral. Furthermore, uncomfortable (but not comfortable) reaching improved the sensitivity for the identification of emotional faces and reduced the identification time of facial expressions, as a possible effect of hyper-arousal from an unpleasant bodily experience."
https://openalex.org/W2015041993,"The first pandemic of the 21st century occurred in 2009 and was caused by the H1N1pdm influenza A virus. Severe cases of H1N1pdm infection in adults are characterized by sustained immune activation, whereas pregnant women are prone to more severe forms of influenza, with increased morbi-mortality. During the H1N1pdm09 pandemic, few studies assessed the immune status of infected pregnant women. The objective of this study was to evaluate the behavior of several immune markers in 13 H1N1pdm2009 virus-infected pregnant (PH1N1) women, in comparison to pregnant women with an influenza-like illness (ILI), healthy pregnant women (HP) and healthy non-pregnant women (HW). The blood leukocyte phenotypes and the serological cytokine and chemokine concentrations of the blood leukocytes, as measured by flow cytometry, showed that the CD69+ cell counts in the T and B-lymphocytes were significantly higher in the PH1N1 group. We found that pro-inflammatory (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines and some chemokines (CXCL8, CXCL10), which are typically at lower levels during pregnancy, were substantially increased in the women in the ILI group. Our findings suggest that CD69 overexpression in blood lymphocytes and elevated levels of serum cytokines might be potential markers for the discrimination of H1N1 disease from other influenza-like illnesses in pregnant women."

Genomic sequencing of Chlamydia indicated this medically important bacterium was not exclusively dependent on the host cell for energy.

Two distinct biosynthetic routes of MK have been described in bacteria (Fig. 1), the well studied traditional route (4.Bentley R. Meganathan R.

An alternative menaquinone biosynthetic pathway operating in microorganisms.Science. 2008; 321: 1670-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Both routes begin with chorismate and involve common enzymes at several of the later steps. Importantly, no organism has been found to possess a complete set of enzymes required for both the traditional and futalosine MK biosynthetic routes (6.Hiratsuka T. Furihata K. Ishikawa J.

Thus, the presence of genes unique to either pathway indicates that complete routes are encoded. Human commensal bacteria, primarily facultative anaerobes (e.g. Lactobacillus), typically do not synthesize MK (7.Brooijmans R. Smit B. Santos F. van Riel J. de Vos W.M. Hugenholtz J. Heme and menaquinone induced electron transport in lactic acid bacteria.Microb. Cell Fact. 2009; 8: 28Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and those that do (e.g. E. coli) utilize the traditional route. The absence of futalosine genes in these organisms strengthens the development of antimicrobial compounds targeting pathogenic bacteria that synthesize MK (8.Dairi T.

Chlamydia are obligate intracellular bacteria and include pathogenic species for which the requisite electron transport quinone is undetermined. The metabolically active form of Chlamydia replicates within a microaerophilic environment inside a modified intracellular vacuole (9.Juul N. Jensen H. Hvid M. Christiansen G. Birkelund S. Characterization of in vitro chlamydial cultures in low-oxygen atmospheres.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 6723-6726Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).

However, genome sequencing indicated otherwise, revealing the presence of four UQ biosynthesis homologs that could play a role in quinone synthesis. As these predicted enzymes could potentially catalyze reactions found in both UQ and MK biosynthetic pathways, the predicted quinone biosynthetic pathway of Chlamydia has remained undefined. Previous reports suggested that Chlamydia possess futalosine enzyme homologs (8.Dairi T.

In keeping with consistent chlamydial nomenclature, all references to this gene product will utilize the C. trachomatis D/UW-3 homolog CT263. CTL0515 and CT263 are 99% identical, with a single substitution (A76G) at the amino acid level. Upon DNA sequence confirmation, the vector was transformed into BL21(DE3) E. coli competent cells. This strain was grown to an A600 of 0.8 at 37 °C within Terrific Broth supplemented with kanamycin (50 µg/ml), and protein expression was induced overnight at 16 °C by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a 1 mm final concentration. Bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole), and then lysed by sonication. The soluble His6-labeled protein was collected in the supernatant following centrifugation of the cell homogenate and purified on a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose column according to published protocols (12.Geisbrecht B.V. Bouyain S. Pop M. An optimized system for expression and purification of secreted bacterial proteins.Protein Expr. Purif. 2006; 46: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Recombinant tobacco etch virus protease was used to digest the fusion affinity tag from the target protein. Both the affinity tag and tobacco etch virus protease were removed by reverse Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose chromatography. After desalting into 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), final purification was achieved by ResourceQ anion-exchange chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography (GE Healthcare). The purified protein was concentrated to 10 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl buffer by ultrafiltration and stored at 4 °C for further use. Selenomethionine (SeMet)-substituted CT263 was grown according to standard protocols (13.Doublié S. Production of selenomethionyl proteins in prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems.Methods Mol. Biol. 2007; 363: 91-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), purified as described above (all buffers contained 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and concentrated to 10 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl buffer for crystallization. Recombinant C. trachomatis CT263 was crystallized by vapor diffusion in Compact Jr. (Emerald Biosystems) sitting drop plates at 20 °C. Specifically, 0.5 µl of protein solution (10 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl) was mixed with 0.5 µl of reservoir solution containing 200 mm ammonium sulfate, 100 mm sodium acetate trihydrate (pH 4.6), and 30% (w/v) PEG 2K MME from the Crystal HT screen condition F1 (Hampton) and equilibrated against 75 µl of the latter. Single rectangular prism-shaped crystals appeared after 1 day and continued to grow for ∼4 days. Crystals were flash-cooled in a cryoprotectant solution consisting of mother liquor with 20% (v/v) glycerol. Gold-derivatized CT263 crystals were generated by incubating native crystals for 24–48 h in mother liquor supplemented with 10 mm K2AuCl4. Crystals that had changed to a yellow color (indicating the likely presence of ordered gold atoms) were harvested as described above. SeMet-CT263 crystals were obtained in essentially the same manner as wild type; however, small block-shaped crystals required reduced ammonium sulfate concentrations as well as increased pH and PEG 2K MME. Briefly, protein solution (0.5 µl) was mixed with 0.5 µl of reservoir solution (50 mm ammonium sulfate, 100 mm BisTris (pH 6.4), and 32% (w/v) PEG 2K MME) and equilibrated against 100 µl of the latter. Small block-shaped crystals were harvested as described above. Ligand-bound CT263 crystals were obtained in a similar manner as wild type. Briefly, CT263 (wild-type or D161N, 10 mg/ml) was incubated with 10 mm MTA on ice for 30 min prior to crystallization. The ligand/protein solution (0.5 µl) was then mixed with 0.5 µl of reservoir solution (200 mm ammonium sulfate, 100 mm sodium acetate trihydrate (pH 4.6) and 30% (w/v) PEG 2K MME) and equilibrated against 100 µl of the latter. Large block-shaped crystals were harvested in a similar manner as described above. X-ray diffraction data were collected on all CT263 crystals at 1.000 Å at 100 K with the exception of CT263-Au and SeMet-CT263 crystals, which were collected at 1.03969 Å and 0.97911 Å, respectively, using a Dectris Pilatus 6 M pixel array detector at IMCA-CAT beamline 17ID at the APS (Table 2).

Disordered side chains were truncated to the point where electron density could be observed. Additional information and refinement statistics are presented in Table 2. Enzymatic assays were performed in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 200 mm KCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol and initiated by the addition of recombinant CT263. CT263 was added to a 200-µl reaction volume at a final concentration of 250 nm. Enzymatic activity was tested against 50 µm of the following substrates: 6-amino-6-deoxyfutalosine (AFL), S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy), 5′-methylthioadenosine (MTA), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Samples were incubated overnight at room temperature and assayed via HPLC. Product peaks were collected, dried on a speed vacuum, and analyzed by mass spectroscopy. Activity with AFL was continuously monitored by UV-visible spectrophotometry at 263 nm. Reactions were performed in 1-ml volumes under similar reaction conditions as above with varying concentrations of AFL. Reactions were initiated by the addition of CT263 to final concentrations of 100–200 nm. A luciferase-coupled assay converted product adenine to ATP in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.7) (22.Sturm M.B.

https://openalex.org/W2326818815,"Mammals contain 1 melanopsin (Opn4) gene that is expressed in a subset of retinal ganglion cells to serve as a photopigment involved in non-image-forming vision such as photoentrainment of circadian rhythms. In contrast, most nonmammalian vertebrates possess multiple melanopsins that are distributed in various types of retinal cells; however, their functions remain unclear. We previously found that the lamprey has only 1 type of mammalian-like melanopsin gene, which is similar to that observed in mammals. Here we investigated the molecular properties and localization of melanopsin in the lamprey and other cyclostome hagfish retinas, which contribute to visual functions including image-forming vision and mainly to non-image-forming vision, respectively. We isolated 1 type of mammalian-like melanopsin cDNA from the eyes of each species. We showed that the recombinant lamprey melanopsin was a blue light-sensitive pigment and that both the lamprey and hagfish melanopsins caused light-dependent increases in calcium ion concentration in cultured cells in a manner that was similar to that observed for mammalian melanopsins. We observed that melanopsin was distributed in several types of retinal cells, including horizontal cells and ganglion cells, in the lamprey retina, despite the existence of only 1 melanopsin gene in the lamprey. In contrast, melanopsin was almost specifically distributed to retinal ganglion cells in the hagfish retina. Furthermore, we found that the melanopsin-expressing horizontal cells connected to the rhodopsin-containing short photoreceptor cells in the lamprey. Taken together, our findings suggest that in cyclostomes, the global distribution of melanopsin in retinal cells might not be related to the melanopsin gene number but to the extent of retinal contribution to visual function."
https://openalex.org/W2023468513,"Gene family encoding small Heat-Shock Proteins (sHSPs containing α-crystallin domain) are found both in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms; however, there is limited knowledge of their evolution. In this study, two small HSP genes termed AvHSP28.6 and AvHSP27, both organized in one intron and two exons, were characterised in the Mediterranean snakelocks anemone Anemonia viridis. The release of the genome sequence of Hydra magnipapillata and Nematostella vectensis enabled a comprehensive study of the molecular evolution of α-crystallin gene family among cnidarians. Most of the H. magnipapillata sHSP genes share the same gene organization described for AvHSP28.6 and AvHSP27, differing from the sHSP genes of N. vectensis which mainly show an intronless architecture. The different genomic organization of sHSPs, the phylogenetic analyses based on protein sequences, and the relationships among Cnidarians, suggest that the A.viridis sHSPs represent the common ancestor from which H. magnipapillata genes directly evolved through segmental genome duplication. Additionally retroposition events may be considered responsible for the divergence of sHSP genes of N. vectensis from A. viridis. Analyses of transcriptional expression profile showed that AvHSP28.6 was constitutively expressed among different tissues from both ectodermal and endodermal layers of the adult sea anemones, under normal physiological conditions and also under different stress condition. Specifically, we profiled the transcriptional activation of AvHSP28.6 after challenges with different abiotic/biotic stresses showing induction by extreme temperatures, heavy metals exposure and immune stimulation. Conversely, no AvHSP27 transcript was detected in such dissected tissues, in adult whole body cDNA library or under stress conditions. Hence, the involvement of AvHSP28.6 gene in the sea anemone defensome is strongly suggested."
https://openalex.org/W2060486089,"Background The transmission of influenza viruses occurs person to person and is facilitated by contacts within enclosed environments such as households. The aim of this study was to evaluate secondary attack rates and factors associated with household transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in the pandemic and post-pandemic seasons. Methods During the 2009–2010 and 2010–2011 influenza seasons, 76 sentinel physicians in Navarra, Spain, took nasopharyngeal and pharyngeal swabs from patients diagnosed with influenza-like illness. A trained nurse telephoned households of those patients who were laboratory-confirmed for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 to ask about the symptoms, risk factors and vaccination status of each household member. Results In the 405 households with a patient laboratory-confirmed for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 977 susceptible contacts were identified; 16% of them (95% CI 14–19%) presented influenza-like illness and were considered as secondary cases. The secondary attack rate was 14% in 2009–2010 and 19% in the 2010–2011 season (p = 0.049), an increase that mainly affected persons with major chronic conditions. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the risk of being a secondary case was higher in the 2010–2011 season than in the 2009–2010 season (adjusted odds ratio: 1.72; 95% CI 1.17–2.54), and in children under 5 years, with a decreasing risk in older contacts. Influenza vaccination was associated with lesser incidence of influenza-like illness near to statistical significance (adjusted odds ratio: 0.29; 95% CI 0.08–1.03). Conclusion The secondary attack rate in households was higher in the second season than in the first pandemic season. Children had a greater risk of infection. Preventive measures should be maintained in the second pandemic season, especially in high-risk persons."
https://openalex.org/W2090693552,"p75 is expressed among Purkinje cells in the adult cerebellum, but its function has remained obscure. Here we report that p75 is involved in maintaining the frequency and regularity of spontaneous firing of Purkinje cells. The overall spontaneous firing activity of Purkinje cells was increased in p75−/− mice during the phasic firing period due to a longer firing period and accompanying reduction in silence period than in the wild type. We attribute these effects to a reduction in small conductance Ca2+-activated potassium (SK) channel activity in Purkinje cells from p75−/− mice compared with the wild type littermates. The mechanism by which p75 regulates SK channel activity appears to involve its ability to activate Rac1. In organotypic cultures of cerebellar slices, brain-derived neurotrophic factor increased RacGTP levels by activating p75 but not TrkB. These results correlate with a reduction in RacGTP levels in synaptosome fractions from the p75−/− cerebellum, but not in that from the cortex of the same animals, compared with wild type littermates. More importantly, we demonstrate that Rac1 modulates SK channel activity and firing patterns of Purkinje cells. Along with the finding that spine density was reduced in p75−/− cerebellum, these data suggest that p75 plays a role in maintaining normalcy of Purkinje cell firing in the cerebellum in part by activating Rac1 in synaptic compartments and modulating SK channels. p75 is expressed among Purkinje cells in the adult cerebellum, but its function has remained obscure.

As one of the small GTPases, Rac1 plays a central role in spine formation during development and in the adult, thereby regulating synaptic activity in a wide variety of neurons (5.de Curtis I.

Interestingly, the effect of RacGTP on synaptic function is not merely a consequence of spine morphology regulation. Rac1 signaling has been shown to affect ion channels, such as Kir2.1 (12.Boyer S.B. Slesinger P.A. Jones S.V. Regulation of Kir2.1 channels by the Rho-GTPase, Rac1.J.

Therefore, Rac1 can modulate neuronal activities at multiple levels during development and plasticity, including acute effects through ion channel regulation and long term consequences resulting from structural changes of dendritic arbors and spines. Indeed, dysregulation of Rac1 has been implicated in several mental disorders, such as schizophrenia (19.Hayashi-Takagi A. Takaki M. Graziane N. Seshadri S. Murdoch H. Dunlop A.J. Makino Y.

Neurosci. 2010; 30: 10977-10984Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Here, we report that p75 also activates Rac1 in synaptic compartments of cerebellar Purkinje cells, and this activation plays a role in maintaining normal firing regularity of Purkinje neurons through, at least in part, regulation of small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (SK) channels. Phospho-PAK, PAK, and PSD95 antibodies were from Cell Signaling; Rac1, Cdc42, and tubulin antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; SK2 antibody was from Alomone Labs; and anti-mouse calbindin was from Swant. The p75 knock-out mice that carried the mutation in exon 3 of the p75 gene (21.Lee K.F. Li E. Huber L.J. Landis S.C. Sharpe A.H. Chao M.V. Jaenisch R.

The mice were back-crossed to C57/BL6 for 10 generations to make them congenic. The genotype was determined by PCR analyses of tail DNA according to Bentley and Lee (22.Bentley C.A. Lee K.F. p75 is important for axon growth and schwann cell migration during development.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7706-7715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cerebellum and cerebral cortex were homogenized with Dounce homogenizers in 0.32 m sucrose and 4 mm HEPES plus 10 mm NaF, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm vanadate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Postnuclear supernatants were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min to collect the pellet, which was subsequently resuspended in the homogenization buffer and overlaid on top of a sucrose step gradient (0.8, 1, and 1.2 m). The gradient was centrifuged at 82,500 × g for 2 h. The resulting fraction that was overlaid onto the interface between 1 and 1.2 m sucrose was collected and overlaid onto 0.8 m sucrose solution and centrifuged at 230,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet contained both presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes, or synaptosomes. The synaptosome pellet was resuspended in a lysis buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 25 mm NaF, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, and 2 mm PMSF. The lysates were subjected to RacGTP assays using pull-down methods as described (3.Harrington A.W. Kim J.Y. Yoon S.O. Activation of Rac GTPase by p75 is Necessary for c-Jun N-terminal kinase-mediated apoptosis.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 156-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Brains were sectioned at 30 µm in a sagittal or coronal plane using a cryostat and used for immunohistochemistry as described (4.Tep C. Kim M.L. Opincariu L.I. Limpert A.S. Chan J.R. Appel B. Carter B.D. Yoon S.O. BDNF induces polarized signaling of small GTPase (Rac1) at the onset of Schwann cell myelination through partitioning-defective 3 (Par3).J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 1600-1608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For p-PAK staining, tissues were subjected to antigen retrieval at 50 °C for 50 min in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0). The images were obtained using a Leica confocal microscope (model TCS SL) at the identical setting for wild type and p75 knock-out sections. Freshly dissected brains were cut at 200 µm on the sagittal plane at 4 °C using a vibratome (Leica), and cerebellar slices that contained all 10 lobules were placed inside a Millicell on the sagittal orientation as described (24.del Río J.A. Soriano E. Regenerating cortical connections in a dish: the entorhino-hippocampal organotypic slice co-culture as tool for pharmacological screening of molecules promoting axon regeneration.Nat. Protoc. 2010; 5: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). BDNF was added to the underlying media at 50 ng/ml, incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, and processed for protein extraction. Mice (postnatal days 15–25) were anesthetized with halothane and sacrificed by decapitation. Sagittal slices of 300-µm thickness were prepared from the vermis of the cerebellum with a vibratome (World Precision Instruments) in ice-cold, oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF): 125 mm NaCl, 26 mm NaHCO3, 1.25 mm NaH2PO4, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm glucose bubbled with 5% CO2 and 95% O2 (pH 7.4). Slices were recovered at 35 °C for 1 h and then maintained at room temperature (22–24 °C) in the aCSF until use. Littermate pairs of the wild type and p75−/− mice were used. The recordings from each pair of littermates were performed either on the same day or on two consecutive days under the same experimental conditions. From each animal, 20–40 Purkinje cells from the apex of the lobule VI of the cerebellum were randomly recorded. Prior to recording, the cerebellar slice was mounted in a chamber on the stage of a Nikon E600-FN upright microscope and continuously perfused (2 ml/min) with a modified aCSF (i.e. aCSF supplemented with 5 mm kynurenic acid (a broad spectrum ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonist) and 100 µm picrotoxin (a GABAA receptor blocker)). The solution was heated to 33–35 °C with an SC-20 in-line solution heater (Harvard Apparatus). The Rac1 inhibitor, NSC23766 (Calbiochem), was diluted in the modified aCSF to 100 µm and applied through whole-chamber perfusion. Extracellular field potentials were recorded using glass electrodes with a tip size of 0.5–1 µm filled with aCSF without the synaptic blockers. The pipette tip was positioned near the initial axon segment of the Purkinje cell soma. Action potentials appeared as fast negative deflections of 100–1000 µV. Only clearly isolated single cell signals were chosen for recording and subsequent analysis. Signals were preamplified and filtered (at 3 kHz) by NPI EXT-10C and LPBF-01GX amplifier/filter modules before being digitized and sampled (at 10 kHz) by the built-in AD/DA converter of an EPC10 amplifier (HEKA Electronics Inc.). Data were analyzed using the Spike2 program (Cambridge Electronic Design). Recording pipettes were pulled from micropipette glass (A-M Systems, Inc., Carlsborg, WA) to 3–5 MΩ and filled with an intracellular solution containing 122 mm potassium gluconate, 9 mm NaCl, 1.8 mm MgCl2, 0.9 mm EGTA, 9 mm HEPES, 14 mm Tris-creatine phosphate, 4 mm Mg-ATP, and 0.3 mm Tris-GTP (pH 7.2) and placed in the modified aCSF. When needed, NSC23766 was diluted in the intracellular solution and applied into the cytoplasm of Purkinje cells through dialysis from the recording pipette. Purkinje cells in lobule VI of mouse cerebellar slices were selected for whole-cell recording using an EPC10 amplifier and the PatchMaster version 2.2.0 software while the slice was continuously perfused with the modified aCSF at 33 °C. Tight (GΩ) seal and high quality break-in were made using the ez-gSEAL pressure controller (NeoBiosystems, Inc., San Jose, CA). As soon as the whole-cell configuration was established, fast and slow capacitances were canceled, and the holding potential was set to −70 mV. Spontaneous firing was recorded after switching to current clamp mode and setting the current injection value to 0. Voltage signals were sampled at 20 kHz using a gap-free recording protocol. Cerebellar Purkinje neurons were isolated as described (69.Raman I.M. Bean B.P. Ionic currents underlying spontaneous action potentials in isolated cerebellar Purkinje neurons.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1663-1674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, the vermal layer of the cerebellum from the wild type or p75−/− mice (P13–P18) was removed and minced in an ice-cold, oxygenated dissociation solution containing 82 mm Na2SO4, 30 mm K2SO4, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, and 0.001% phenol red (pH 7.4). The minced tissue was subsequently incubated in the dissociation solution with 3 mg/ml protease XXIII (pH 7.4; Sigma) at 35 °C for 7 min while oxygen was blown over the surface of the solution. Subsequently, the tissue was washed in prewarmed, oxygenated dissociation solution containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 1 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor and then maintained in Tyrode's solution containing 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose at room temperature (pH 7.4) while oxygen was blown over the surface of the fluid. Occasionally, an aliquot of the tissue suspension was withdrawn and triturated with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette to liberate individual neurons. Purkinje cells were identified by their large diameter and characteristic pearlike shape. Dendrites were rarely seen, but some dendritic membrane may have been incorporated into the isolated neurons. Cells were used between 30 min and 4 h of dissociation. Acutely dissociated Purkinje cells were allowed to settle in the recording chamber for 5 min. After washing out tissue debris with Tyrode's solution, Purkinje cells with a pearlike shape and smooth surface were selected. Recording pipettes (2–4 MΩ) were filled with an intracellular solution containing 122 mm potassium gluconate, 9 mm NaCl, 1.8 mm MgCl2, 0.9 mm EGTA, 9 mm HEPES, 14 mm Tris-creatine phosphate, 4 mm MgATP, and 0.3 mm Tris-GTP (pH 7.2). The control external solution was Tyrode's solution, which was applied to the recorded cell during the gigaseal formation. After adding 300 nm tetrodotoxin (TTX) to Tyrode's solution to block all major sodium channels, the solution was referred to as “Ca ECS”. A “Co ECS” solution was made by replacing CaCl2 in Ca ECS with 2 mm CoCl2, which reversibly blocks calcium currents through all types of calcium channels. In order to block certain potassium channels, tetraethylammonium (TEA; 1 mm) was added to Ca ECS and Co ECS to make “CaTEA ECS” and “CoTEA ECS,” respectively. Fast change of different ECS was achieved by using a pressure-driven, solenoid valve-controlled perfusion system (SmartSquirt 8, AutoMate Scientific). The open end of the perfusion probe was positioned near the cell to ensure complete coverage of the cell by the perfusate. Whole-cell recordings of isolated Purkinje cells were performed at room temperature (22–24 °C) using the EPC10 amplifier. Current signals were digitized at 10 kHz. After establishment of the whole-cell configuration, the cell was voltage-clamped at −80 mV. Fast and slow capacitances were canceled using the auto compensation function of the PatchMaster software. For isolation of potassium currents, voltage step protocols were repeated when the cell was exposed to Ca ECS, Co ECS, CaTEA ECS, and CoTEA ECS sequentially. For quantification of ionic currents of interest, recordings from the last three ECS solutions were subtracted from their corresponding control records. To evaluate SK channel activities, we adopted a voltage clamp protocol used previously to isolate SK-mediated tail currents in cerebellar Purkinje cells (25.Cingolani L.A. Gymnopoulos M. Boccaccio A. Stocker M. Pedarzani P. Developmental regulation of small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel expression and function in rat Purkinje neurons.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4456-4467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For this study, cerebellar slices prepared from a pair of wild type and p75−/− littermates were recorded on the same day. The slice was perfused with aCSF supplemented with 1 µm TTX and 1 mm TEA to block voltage-gated Na+ channels, most of the voltage-gated K+ channels, and large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BK) channels. Drugs (100 nm apamin or 100 µm NSC23766) were applied to the cerebellar slice through bath perfusion. Purkinje cells located in lobules V–VII were randomly picked. The patch electrode was filled with an intracellular solution containing 135 mm potassium gluconate, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm Na2-ATP, 0.4 mm Na3-GTP, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2–7.3 with KOH). Purkinje cells were held at −50 mV before stepping to potentials ranging from −10 to +30 mV every 30 s for a period of 100–300 ms to induce unclamped Ca2+ spike complexes. At the end of the voltage step, the membrane potential was stepped back to −50 mV to allow for the generation of Ca2+-activated tail currents. Using this protocol, currents evoked during the voltage step were not fully clamped due to space clamp errors. However, the voltage control after the step back to −50 mV can be well maintained (26.Sah P. Role of calcium influx and buffering in the kinetics of Ca2+-activated K+ current in rat vagal motoneurons.J. Neurophysiol. 1992; 68: 2237-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 27.Constanti A. Sim J.A. Calcium-dependent potassium conductance in guinea-pig olfactory cortex neurones in vitro.J. Physiol. 1987; 387: 173-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Because individual Purkinje cells responded to the same voltage step with distinct numbers and positions of Ca2+ spike complexes, which could strongly affect the size and shape of the tail currents, special care was taken to maintain the constant number and position of Ca2+ spikes before and during the drug application. In most recordings, step parameters were adjusted to allow only one Ca2+ spike complex with the peak occurring right in the middle of the step (see Fig. 3A (a), region 2, inward peak). This ensured no or little overlap between currents of the Ca2+ spike complex and the tail current and a good consistency of all tail currents recorded from the same cell. SK currents were evaluated based on either the peak tail current amplitude (for the comparison between p75+/− and p75−/− neurons) or the tail current amplitude at the time when maximal inhibition by NSC23766 was achieved. Because the size of the Ca2+ spike may potentially affect tail current amplitude, SK tail current was normalized to the integral of the Ca2+ spike complex from the same recording and then used for paired comparison between p75+/− and p75−/− cells (for Fig. 3C (c)) and for paired comparison before and during the NSC23766 treatment for the same cell (for Fig. 6B (b)).FIGURE 6SK channel activity is regulated by Rac1 in Purkinje cells.

Data are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test and analysis of variance. p < 0.05 was defined as statistically significant. Mice were perfused with 2% paraformaldehyde, 2% glutaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) prior to dissecting the brain (n = 3 for each genotype). The brain was first cut in a sagittal plane, and 1 × 1-mm square areas were cut out from the lobule VI/VII. The tissues were rinsed in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer and placed in 1% osmium, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate for 1–1.5 h at room temperature. The tissues were stained en bloc for 1 h in 2% uranyl acetate and embedded in Spurr resin following dehydration procedures. Sections were cut at 80 nm using a Reichert Ultracut E ultramicrotome and collected on 300-mesh grids. Sections were stained in 2% uranyl acetate and Reynolds lead citrate before observation in an FEI Technai G2 Spirit transmission electron microscope at 60 kV (Ohio State University Campus Microscopy and Imaging Facility). For quantification of spine head areas, the electron photomicrographs were taken at ×15,750 magnification, and the spine length and spine head area were calculated using ImageJ software in a blinded manner. For statistical analyses, Student's t test was used. Freshly dissected brains were stained for Golgi analysis using the Rapid GolgiStainTM kit as directed by the manufacturer (FD Neurotechnologies Inc.) and sectioned in the sagittal plane at 200 µm. Five Purkinje neurons from each of lobes IV, V, VI, and VII of each cerebellum per set of p75+/+ and p75−/− mice (n = 3) were then analyzed in a blinded manner using the Neurolucida® 7 image analysis system (MBF Biosciences), and the spine density was determined. For each Purkinje neuron, at least five different dendritic secondary and tertiary branches were randomly selected for spine analysis at ×100 magnification to obtain the number of spines per given length of the dendritic branch. For statistical analyses, Student's t test was used. Rodent cerebellar Purkinje cells are known to fire spontaneously in the absence of any afferent inputs at a relatively constant rate (tonic firing) or intermittently with pauses of variable lengths that separate the firing periods (phasic firing). During phasic firing, there can also be a short duration of bursting, which typically precedes long pauses or silence periods, giving rise to the so-called trimodal firing pattern of Purkinje neurons (28.Womack M.

https://openalex.org/W1990266541,"Epidemiological models are key tools for designing and evaluating detection and control strategies against animal infectious diseases. In France, after decades of decrease of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) incidence, the disease keeps circulating. Increasing prevalence levels are observed in several areas, where the detection and control strategy could be adapted. The objective of this work was to design and calibrate a model of the within-herd transmission of bTB. The proposed model is a stochastic model operating in discrete-time. Three health states were distinguished: susceptible, latent and infected. Dairy and beef herd dynamics and bTB detection and control programs were explicitly represented. Approximate Bayesian computation was used to estimate three model parameters from field data: the transmission parameter when animals are inside (βinside) and outside (βoutside) buildings, and the duration of the latent phase. An independent dataset was used for model validation. The estimated median was 0.43 [0.16–0.84] month−1 for βinside and 0.08 [0.01–0.32] month−1 for βoutside. The median duration of the latent period was estimated 3.5 [2]–[8] months. The sensitivity analysis showed only minor influences of fixed parameter values on these posterior estimates. Validation based on an independent dataset showed that in more than 80% of herds, the observed proportion of animals with detected lesions was between the 2.5% and 97.5% percentiles of the simulated distribution. In the absence of control program and once bTB has become enzootic within a herd, the median effective reproductive ratio was estimated to be 2.2 in beef herds and 1.7 in dairy herds. These low estimates are consistent with field observations of a low prevalence level in French bTB-infected herds."

The ring, composed of 10 copies of Atp9p, is part of the rotor that couples proton translocation to synthesis or hydrolysis of ATP. We present evidence that before its assembly with other ATP synthase modules, most of Atp9p is present in at least three complexes with masses of 200-400 kDa that co-immunopurify with Cox6p. Pulse-labeling analysis disclosed a time-dependent reduction of radiolabeled Atp9p in the complexes and an increase of Atp9p in the ring form of wild type yeast and of mss51, pet111, and pet494 mutants lacking Cox1p, Cox2p, and Cox3p, respectively. Ring formation was not significantly different from wild type in an mss51 or atp10 mutant. The atp10 mutation blocks the interaction of the Atp9p ring with other modules of the ATP synthase. In contrast, ring formation was reduced in a cox6 mutant, consistent with a role of Cox6p in oligomerization of Atp9p. Cox6p involvement in ATP synthase assembly is also supported by studies showing that ring formation in cells adapting from fermentative to aerobic growth was less efficient in mitochondria of the cox6 mutant than the parental respiratory-competent strain or a cox4 mutant. We speculate that the constitutive and Cox6p-independent rate of Atp9p oligomerization may be sufficient to produce the level of ATP synthase needed for maintaining a membrane potential but limiting for optimal oxidative phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2062861516,"Complex biomedical research can lead to disquiet in communities with limited exposure to scientific discussions, leading to rumours or to high drop-out rates. We set out to test an intervention designed to address apprehensions commonly encountered in a community where literacy is uncommon, and where complex biomedical research has been conducted for over a decade. We aimed to determine if it could improve the validity of consent.Data were collected using focus group discussions, key informant interviews and observations. We designed an intervention that exposed participants to a detailed demonstration of laboratory processes. Each group was interviewed twice in a day, before and after exposure to the intervention in order to assess changes in their views.Factors that motivated people to participate in invasive biomedical research included a desire to stay healthy because of the screening during the recruitment process, regular advice from doctors, free medical services, and trust in the researchers. Inhibiting factors were limited knowledge about samples taken from their bodies during endoscopic procedures, the impact of endoscopy on the function of internal organs, and concerns about the use of biomedical samples. The belief that blood can be used for Satanic practices also created insecurities about drawing of blood samples. Further inhibiting factors included a fear of being labelled as HIV positive if known to consult heath workers repeatedly, and gender inequality. Concerns about the use and storage of blood and tissue samples were overcome by a laboratory exposure intervention.Selecting a group of members from target community and engaging them in a laboratory exposure intervention could be a useful tool for enhancing specific aspects of consent for biomedical research. Further work is needed to determine the extent to which improved understanding permeates beyond the immediate group participating in the intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2005552732,"Coalescent theory provides powerful models for population genetic inference and is now increasingly important in estimates of divergence times and speciation research. We use molecular data and methods based on coalescent theory to investigate whether genetic evidence supports the hypothesis of A. pretrei and A. tucumana as separate species and whether genetic data allow us to assess which allopatric model seems to better explain the diversification process in these taxa. We sampled 13 A. tucumana from two provinces in northern Argentina and 28 A. pretrei from nine localities of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. A 491 bp segment of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase I was evaluated using the haplotype network and phylogenetic methods. The divergence time and other demographic quantities were estimated using the isolation and migration model based on coalescent theory. The network and phylogenetic reconstructions showed similar results, supporting reciprocal monophyly for these two taxa. The divergence time of lineage separation was estimated to be approximately 1.3 million years ago, which corresponds to the lower Pleistocene. Our results enforce the current taxonomic status for these two Amazon species. They also support that A. pretrei and A. tucumana diverged with little or no gene flow approximately 1.3 million years ago, most likely after the establishment of a small population in the Southern Yungas forest by dispersion of a few founders from the A. pretrei ancestral population. This process may have been favored by habitat corridors formed in hot and humid periods of the Quaternary. Considering that these two species are considered threatened, the results were evaluated for their implications for the conservation of these two species."
https://openalex.org/W2049013342,"Studies of the origin and maintenance of disjunct distributions are of special interest in biogeography. Disjunct distributions can arise following extinction of intermediate populations of a formerly continuous range and later maintained by climatic specialization. We tested hypotheses about how the currently disjunct distribution of the Blossomcrown (Anthocephala floriceps), a hummingbird species endemic to Colombia, arose and how is it maintained. By combining molecular data and models of potential historical distributions we evaluated: (1) the timing of separation between the two populations of the species, (2) whether the disjunct distribution could have arisen as a result of fragmentation of a formerly widespread range due to climatic changes, and (3) if the disjunct distribution might be currently maintained by specialization of each population to different climatic conditions. We found that the two populations are reciprocally monophyletic for mitochondrial and nuclear loci, and that their divergence occurred ca. 1.4 million years before present (95% credibility interval 0.7-2.1 mybp). Distribution models based on environmental data show that climate has likely not been suitable for a fully continuous range over the past 130,000 years, but the potential distribution 6,000 ybp was considerably larger than at present. Tests of climatic divergence suggest that significant niche divergence between populations is a likely explanation for the maintenance of their disjunct ranges. However, based on climate the current range of A. floriceps could potentially be much larger than it currently is, suggesting other ecological or historical factors have influenced it. Our results showing that the distribution of A. floriceps has been discontinous for a long period of time and that populations exhibit different climatic niches have taxonomic and conservation implications."
https://openalex.org/W2121606974,"Temperature is an important factor in affecting population dynamics and diffusion distribution of organisms. Alien species can successfully invade and colonize to various temperature environments, and one of important reasons is that alien species have a strong resistance to stress temperature. Recently, researchers have focused on the mechanisms of temperature sensing to determine the sensing and regulation mechanisms of temperature adaptation. The transient receptor potential (TRP) is one of the key components of an organism's temperature perception system. TRP plays important roles in perceiving temperature, such as avoiding high temperature, low temperature and choosing the optimum temperature. To assess high temperature sensation and the heat resistance role of the TRP gene, we used 3' and 5' rapid-amplification of cDNA ends to isolate the full-length cDNA sequence of the TRP gene from Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) MEAM1 (Middle East Asia Minor 1), examined the mRNA expression profile under various temperature conditions, and identified the heat tolerance function. This is the first study to characterize the TRP gene of invasive B. tabaci MEAM1 (MEAM1 BtTRP). The full-length cDNA of MEAM1 BtTRP was 3871 bp, and the open reading frames of BtTRP was 3501 bp, encoding 1166 amino acids. Additionally, the BtTRP mRNA expression level was significantly increased at 35°C. Furthermore, compared with control treatments, the survival rate of B. tabaci MEAM1 adults was significantly decreased under high temperature stress conditions after feeding with dsRNA BtTRP. Collectively, these results showed that MEAM1 BtTRP is a key element in sensing high temperature and plays an essential role in B. tabaci MEAM1 heat tolerance ability. Our data improved our understanding of the mechanism of temperature sensation in B. tabaci MEAM1 at the molecular level and could contribute to the understanding of the thermal biology of B. tabaci MEAM1 within the context of global climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2066938443,"Neuroscience education can be promoted by the availability of low cost and engaging teaching materials. To address this issue, we developed an open-source lipid bilayer amplifier, the OpenPicoAmp, which is appropriate for use in introductory courses in biophysics or neurosciences dealing with the electrical properties of the cell membrane. The amplifier is designed using the common lithographic printed circuit board fabrication process and off-the-shelf electronic components. In addition, we propose a specific design for experimental chambers allowing the insertion of a commercially available polytetrafluoroethylene film. This experimental setup can be used in simple experiments in which students monitor the bilayer formation by capacitance measurement and record unitary currents produced by ionic channels like gramicidin A. Used in combination with a low-cost data acquisition board this system provides a complete solution for hands-on lessons, therefore improving the effectiveness in teaching basic neurosciences or biophysics."
https://openalex.org/W2091621944,"ISPRA, on behalf of the Italian Ministry of Environment, carried out the initial assessment of environmental quality status of the 3 Italian subregions (Mediterranean Sea Region) on Descriptor 9. The approach adopted to define the GES started to verify that contaminants in fish and other seafood for human consumption did not exceed levels established by Community legislation (Reg. 1881/2006 and further updates). As the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) requires to use health tools to assess the environment, Italy decided to adopt a statistical range of acceptance of thresholds identified by national (D.Lgs. 152/2006 concerning water quality required for mussel farms) and international legislation (Reg. 1881/2006 and further updates), which allowed to use the health results and to employ them for the assessment of environmental quality. Italy proposed that Good Environmental Status (GES) is achieved when concentrations are lower than statistical range of acceptance, estimated on samples of fish and fishery products coming from only national waters. GIS-based approach a to perform different integration levels for station, cell’s grid and years, was used; the elaborations allowed to judge the environmental quality good."
