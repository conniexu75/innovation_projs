https://openalex.org/W2017515700,"The structural basis for the distinction of viral RNA from abundant self RNA in the cytoplasm of virally infected cells is largely unknown. We demonstrated that the 5'-triphosphate end of RNA generated by viral polymerases is responsible for retinoic acid-inducible protein I (RIG-I)-mediated detection of RNA molecules. Detection of 5'-triphosphate RNA is abrogated by capping of the 5'-triphosphate end or by nucleoside modification of RNA, both occurring during posttranscriptional RNA processing in eukaryotes. Genomic RNA prepared from a negative-strand RNA virus and RNA prepared from virus-infected cells (but not from noninfected cells) triggered a potent interferon-alpha response in a phosphatase-sensitive manner. 5'-triphosphate RNA directly binds to RIG-I. Thus, uncapped 5'-triphosphate RNA (now termed 3pRNA) present in viruses known to be recognized by RIG-I, but absent in viruses known to be detected by MDA-5 such as the picornaviruses, serves as the molecular signature for the detection of viral infection by RIG-I."
https://openalex.org/W2009127910,"Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) produced during viral replication is believed to be the critical trigger for activation of antiviral immunity mediated by the RNA helicase enzymes retinoic acid–inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation–associated gene 5 (MDA5). We showed that influenza A virus infection does not generate dsRNA and that RIG-I is activated by viral genomic single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) bearing 5′-phosphates. This is blocked by the influenza protein nonstructured protein 1 (NS1), which is found in a complex with RIG-I in infected cells. These results identify RIG-I as a ssRNA sensor and potential target of viral immune evasion and suggest that its ability to sense 5'-phosphorylated RNA evolved in the innate immune system as a means of discriminating between self and nonself."
https://openalex.org/W2101512932,"Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory of the strong interaction, explaining (for example) the binding of three almost massless quarks into a much heavier proton or neutron--and thus most of the mass of the visible Universe. The standard model of particle physics predicts a QCD-related transition that is relevant for the evolution of the early Universe. At low temperatures, the dominant degrees of freedom are colourless bound states of hadrons (such as protons and pions). However, QCD is asymptotically free, meaning that at high energies or temperatures the interaction gets weaker and weaker, causing hadrons to break up. This behaviour underlies the predicted cosmological transition between the low-temperature hadronic phase and a high-temperature quark-gluon plasma phase (for simplicity, we use the word 'phase' to characterize regions with different dominant degrees of freedom). Despite enormous theoretical effort, the nature of this finite-temperature QCD transition (that is, first-order, second-order or analytic crossover) remains ambiguous. Here we determine the nature of the QCD transition using computationally demanding lattice calculations for physical quark masses. Susceptibilities are extrapolated to vanishing lattice spacing for three physical volumes, the smallest and largest of which differ by a factor of five. This ensures that a true transition should result in a dramatic increase of the susceptibilities. No such behaviour is observed: our finite-size scaling analysis shows that the finite-temperature QCD transition in the hot early Universe was not a real phase transition, but an analytic crossover (involving a rapid change, as opposed to a jump, as the temperature varied). As such, it will be difficult to find experimental evidence of this transition from astronomical observations."
https://openalex.org/W2069929255,"Neural activity increases local blood flow in the central nervous system (CNS), which is the basis of BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent) and PET (positron emission tomography) functional imaging techniques. Blood flow is assumed to be regulated by precapillary arterioles, because capillaries lack smooth muscle. However, most (65%) noradrenergic innervation of CNS blood vessels terminates near capillaries rather than arterioles, and in muscle and brain a dilatory signal propagates from vessels near metabolically active cells to precapillary arterioles, suggesting that blood flow control is initiated in capillaries. Pericytes, which are apposed to CNS capillaries and contain contractile proteins, could initiate such signalling. Here we show that pericytes can control capillary diameter in whole retina and cerebellar slices. Electrical stimulation of retinal pericytes evoked a localized capillary constriction, which propagated at approximately 2 microm s(-1) to constrict distant pericytes. Superfused ATP in retina or noradrenaline in cerebellum resulted in constriction of capillaries by pericytes, and glutamate reversed the constriction produced by noradrenaline. Electrical stimulation or puffing GABA (gamma-amino butyric acid) receptor blockers in the inner retina also evoked pericyte constriction. In simulated ischaemia, some pericytes constricted capillaries. Pericytes are probably modulators of blood flow in response to changes in neural activity, which may contribute to functional imaging signals and to CNS vascular disease."

We experimentally observed their spontaneous, template-free organization into free-floating particulate sheets, which resemble the assembly of surface layer (S-layer) proteins. Computer simulation and concurrent experiments demonstrated that the dipole moment, small positive charge, and directional hydrophobic attraction are the driving forces for the self-organization process. The data presented here highlight the analogy of the solution behavior of the two vastly different classes of chemical structures."

https://openalex.org/W1996187477,"The treelike structures of many organs, including the mammary gland, are generated by branching morphogenesis, a reiterative process of branch initiation and invasion from a preexisting epithelium. Using a micropatterning approach to control the initial three-dimensional structure of mouse mammary epithelial tubules in culture, combined with an algorithm to quantify the extent of branching, we found that the geometry of tubules dictates the position of branches. We predicted numerically and confirm experimentally that branches initiate at sites with a local minimum in the concentration of autocrine inhibitory morphogens, such as transforming growth factor–β. These results reveal that tissue geometry can control organ morphogenesis by defining the local cellular microenvironment, a finding that has relevance to control of invasion and metastasis."

Here, we report the complete genome sequence of the psyllid symbiont Carsonella ruddii, which consists of a circular chromosome of 159,662 base pairs, averaging 16.5% GC content. It is by far the smallest and most AT-rich bacterial genome yet characterized. The genome has a high coding density (97%) with many overlapping genes and reduced gene length. Genes for translation and amino acid biosynthesis are relatively well represented, but numerous genes considered essential for life are missing, suggesting that Carsonella may have achieved organelle-like status."

https://openalex.org/W2104833230,"An analysis of 1516 radiocarbon dates demonstrates that the development of the current circumarctic peatlands began ∼16.5 thousand years ago (ka) and expanded explosively between 12 and 8 ka in concert with high summer insolation and increasing temperatures. Their rapid development contributed to the sustained peak in CH 4 and modest decline of CO 2 during the early Holocene and likely contributed to CH 4 and CO 2 fluctuations during earlier interglacial and interstadial transitions. Given the decreased tempo of peatland initiation in the late Holocene and the transition of many from fens (which generated high levels of CH 4 ) to ombrotrophic bogs, a neoglacial expansion of northern peatlands cannot explain the increase in atmospheric CH 4 that occurred after 6 ka."
https://openalex.org/W2081407315,"A method is presented for controlling the outcome of photochemical reactions by using the dynamic Stark effect due to a strong, nonresonant infrared field. The application of a precisely timed infrared laser pulse reversibly modifies potential energy barriers during a chemical reaction without inducing any real electronic transitions. Dynamic Stark control (DSC) is experimentally demonstrated for a nonadiabatic photochemical reaction, showing substantial modification of reaction channel probabilities in the dissociation of IBr. The DSC process is nonperturbative and insensitive to laser frequency and affects all polarizable molecules, suggesting broad applicability."

The 422,434–base pair genome of Buchnera aphidicola BCc, primary endosymbiont of the aphid Cinara cedri , is ∼200 kilobases smaller than the previously sequenced B. aphidicola genomes. B. aphidicola BCc has lost most metabolic functions, including the ability to synthesize the essential amino acid tryptophan and riboflavin. In addition, most retained genes are evolving rapidly. Possibly, B. aphidicola BCc is losing its symbiotic capacity and is being complemented (and might be replaced) by the highly abundant coexisting secondary symbiont."
https://openalex.org/W2056677650,"The function of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) is often abolished after DNA damage. The inhibition of CDK2 plays a central role in DNA damage–induced cell cycle arrest and DNA repair. However, whether CDK2 also influences the survival of cells under genotoxic stress is unknown. Forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors are emerging as key regulators of cell survival. CDK2 specifically phosphorylated FOXO1 at serine-249 (Ser 249 ) in vitro and in vivo. Phosphorylation of Ser 249 resulted in cytoplasmic localization and inhibition of FOXO1. This phosphorylation was abrogated upon DNA damage through the cell cycle checkpoint pathway that is dependent on the protein kinases Chk1 and Chk2. Moreover, silencing of FOXO1 by small interfering RNA diminished DNA damage–induced death in both p53-deficient and p53-proficient cells. This effect was reversed by restored expression of FOXO1 in a manner depending on phosphorylation of Ser 249 . Functional interaction between CDK2 and FOXO1 provides a mechanism that regulates apoptotic cell death after DNA strand breakage."

The approximately 1.5-kilometer-diameter primary (Alpha) is an unconsolidated gravitational aggregate with a spin period approximately 2.8 hours, bulk density approximately 2 grams per cubic centimeter, porosity approximately 50%, and an oblate shape dominated by an equatorial ridge at the object's potential-energy minimum. The approximately 0.5-kilometer secondary (Beta) is elongated and probably is denser than Alpha. Its average orbit about Alpha is circular with a radius approximately 2.5 kilometers and period approximately 17.4 hours, and its average rotation is synchronous with the long axis pointed toward Alpha, but librational departures from that orientation are evident. Exotic physical and dynamical properties may be common among near-Earth binaries."
https://openalex.org/W2031318656,"Riboswitches are structured RNAs typically located in the 5′ untranslated regions of bacterial mRNAs that bind metabolites and control gene expression. Most riboswitches sense one metabolite and function as simple genetic switches. However, we found that the 5′ region of the Bacillus clausii metE messenger RNA includes two riboswitches that respond to S -adenosylmethionine and coenzyme B 12 . This tandem arrangement yields a composite gene control system that functions as a two-input Boolean NOR logic gate. These findings and the discovery of additional tandem riboswitch architectures reveal how simple RNA elements can be assembled to make sophisticated genetic decisions without involving protein factors."

https://openalex.org/W2168463034,"Stereoblastic embryos from the Doushantuo Formation of China exhibit occasional asynchronous cell division, with diminishing blastomere volume as cleavage proceeded. Asynchronous cell division is common in modern embryos, implying that sophisticated mechanisms for differential cell division timing and embryonic cell lineage differentiation evolved before 551 million years ago. Subcellular structures akin to organelles, coated yolk granules, or lipid vesicles occur in these embryos. Paired reniform structures within embryo cells may represent fossil evidence of cells about to undergo division. Embryos exhibit no evidence of epithelial organization, even in embryos composed of â¼1000 cells. Many of these features are compatible with metazoans, but the absence of epithelialization is consistent only with a stem-metazoan affinity for Doushantuo embryos."
https://openalex.org/W2006687407,"The Ladolam hydrothermal system, on Lihir Island, Papua New Guinea, hosts one of the youngest and largest gold deposits in the world. Several deep (more than 1 kilometer) geothermal wells were drilled beneath the ore bodies to extract water at &gt;275°C and to facilitate open-pit mining. Using a titanium down-hole sampler, we determined that the deep geothermal brine of magmatic origin contains ∼15 parts per billion gold. At the current gold flux of 24 kilograms per year, this deposit could have formed within ∼55,000 years. The combination of sustained metal flux and efficient metal precipitation led to the formation of a giant hydrothermal gold deposit in a short period."

Many tumor-specific antigens are mutant proteins that are predominantly intracellular and thus not readily accessible to monoclonal antibodies. We found that a wild-type transmembrane protein could be transformed into a tumor-specific antigen. A somatic mutation in the chaperone gene Cosmc abolished function of a glycosyltransferase, disrupting O-glycan Core 1 synthesis and creating a tumor-specific glycopeptidic neo-epitope consisting of a monosaccharide and a specific wild-type protein sequence. This epitope induced a high-affinity, highly specific, syngeneic monoclonal antibody with antitumor activity. Such tumor-specific glycopeptidic neo-epitopes represent potential targets for monoclonal antibody therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2003197155,"Voltage-dependent K+ (Kv) currents in macrophages are mainly mediated by Kv1.3, but biophysical properties indicate that the channel composition could be different from that of T-lymphocytes. K+ currents in mouse bone marrow-derived and Raw-264.7 macrophages are sensitive to Kv1.3 blockers, but unlike T-cells, macrophages express Kv1.5. Because Shaker subunits (Kv1) may form heterotetrameric complexes, we investigated whether Kv1.5 has a function in Kv currents in macrophages. Kv1.3 and Kv1.5 co-localize at the membrane, and half-activation voltages and pharmacology indicate that K+ currents may be accounted for by various Kv complexes in macrophages. Co-expression of Kv1.3 and Kv1.5 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells showed that the presence of Kv1.5 leads to a positive shift in K+ current half-activation voltages and that, like Kv1.3, Kv1.3/Kv1.5 heteromers are sensitive to r-margatoxin. In addition, both proteins co-immunoprecipitate and co-localize. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies further demonstrated that Kv1.5 and Kv1.3 form heterotetramers. Electrophysiological and pharmacological studies of different ratios of Kv1.3 and Kv1.5 co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes suggest that various hybrids might be responsible for K+ currents in macrophages. Tumor necrosis factor-α-induced activation of macrophages increased Kv1.3 with no changes in Kv.1.5, which is consistent with a hyperpolarized shift in half-activation voltage and a lower IC50 for margatoxin. Taken together, our results demonstrate that Kv1.5 co-associates with Kv1.3, generating functional heterotetramers in macrophages.

Ion Channels of Excitable Cells, 3rd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar). In addition, they are involved in the activation and proliferation of leukocytes (2Cahalan M.D. Wulff H. Chandy K.G. J. Clin. Immunol. 2001; 21: 235-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Functional Kv complexes are formed by four transmembrane α subunits and up to four cytoplasmic β subunits (3Martens J.R. Kwak Y.G. Tamkun M.M. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1999; 9: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The mammalian Shaker family (Kv1) contains at least eight different genes (Kv1.1-Kv1.8), coding for α subunits, which form functional homo- and heterotetrameric complexes. Thus, Kv1 proteins can assemble promiscuously, yielding a wide variety of biophysically and pharmacologically distinct channels (4MacKinnon R. Nature. 1991; 350: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar, 5Isacoff E.Y. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1990; 345: 530-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). However, although a number of studies have demonstrated that specific Kv heteromeric complexes predominate in nerve and muscle, many other possible combinations go undetected (6Wang F.C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 7Po S. Roberds S. Snyders D.J. Tamkun M.M. Bennett P.B. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 1326-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Therefore, this mechanism of channel assembly may underlie some of the functional diversity of potassium currents found in the brain and the cardiovascular system. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) are fully differentiated cells. In response to different growth factors and cytokines, macrophages can proliferate, become activated, or differentiate. These cells have a key function at inflammatory loci, where they arrive 24-48 h after lesion and remain until inflammation disappears. However, the persistence of macrophages at inflammatory loci is associated with the pathogenesis of a wide range of inflammatory diseases. Kv are tightly regulated during proliferation and activation in macrophages, and their functional activity is important for cellular responses (8Vicente R. Escalada A. Coma M. Fuster G. Sanchez-Trillo E. Lopez-Iglesias C. Soler C. Solsona C. Celada A. Felipe A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278 (Correction (2005) J. Biol.

Proliferation and activation trigger an induction of the outward K+ current that is under transcriptional and translational control (8Vicente R. Escalada A. Coma M. Fuster G. Sanchez-Trillo E. Lopez-Iglesias C. Soler C. Solsona C. Celada A. Felipe A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278 (Correction (2005) J. Biol.

In this context, assigning specific K+ channel clones to native currents is difficult, since this complexity is further enhanced by heteromultimeric assembly of different Kv subunits. Lymphocytes express several voltage-dependent K+ currents (n, n′, and l-type channels). Although Kv1.3, the major Kv channel in leukocytes, is associated with the n-type channel and Kv3.1 accounts for the l-type, the proteins responsible for the n′-type are unknown (2Cahalan M.D. Wulff H. Chandy K.G. J. Clin. Immunol. 2001; 21: 235-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar).

Thus, different K+ channel subunit composition could lead to specific alteration of cellular excitability, thus determining specific cell responses. The aim of the present study was to explore whether Kv1.5 has a function in the major voltage-dependent K+ current in macrophages. Our results suggest that Kv1.5 co-associates with Kv1.3, generating functional Kv1.3/Kv1.5 heterotetrameric channels. Upon different physiological stimuli, changes in the oligomeric composition of functional Kv could have a crucial effect on intracellular signals, determining the specific macrophage response. Animals and Cell Culture—BMDM and Raw 264.7 macrophages, human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells, EL-4 T cell line, and Xenopus laevis oocytes were used. BMDM from 6-10-week-old BALB/c mice (Charles River Laboratories) were isolated and cultured as described elsewhere (8Vicente R. Escalada A. Coma M. Fuster G. Sanchez-Trillo E. Lopez-Iglesias C.

Briefly, animals were killed by cervical dislocation, and both femurs were dissected with adherent tissue removed. The ends of bones were cut off, and the marrow tissue was flushed by irrigation with medium. The marrow plugs were passed through a 25-gauge needle for dispersion. The cells were cultured in plastic dishes (150 mm) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum and 30% L-cell-conditioned media as a source of macrophage-colony stimulating factor. Macrophages were obtained as a homogeneous population of adherent cells after 7 days of culture and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Raw 264.7 macrophages and EL-4 and HEK-293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium culture media containing 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 10 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin and 2 mm l-glutamine. Cells were grown in 100-mm tissue culture dishes for sample collection and on non-coated glass coverslips for electrophysiology and confocal imaging. In some experiments Raw 264.7 cells were incubated with 100 ng/ml recombinant TNF-α (PrepoTech E) for 24 h. All animal handling was approved by the ethics committee of the University of Barcelona and was in accordance with European Union regulations. RNA Isolation and RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA from tissues (brain, liver) and cell lines was isolated using the Tripure isolation reagent (Roche Diagnostics). To avoid DNA contamination, the obtained RNA was treated with DNase I, and additional PCR controls were performed in the absence of reverse transcriptase. Ready-to-Go RT-PCR beads (Amersham Biosciences) were used in a one-step RT-PCR reaction. Total RNA and Kv1.3 and Kv1.5 primers were added to the beads as described (8Vicente R. Escalada A. Coma M.

Forward and reverse oligonucleotide sequences and accession numbers were as follows: Kv1.3 (accession number M30441; forward, 5′-CTCATCTCCATTGTCATCTTCTGA-3′, base pairs 741-765; reverse, 5′-TTGAAGTTGGAAACAATCAC-3′, base pairs 1459-1440); Kv1.5 (accession number AF302768, forward, 5′-GGATCACTCCATCACCAG-3′, base pairs 3003-3020; reverse, 5′-GGCTTCCTCCTCCTTCCTTG-3′, base pairs 3337-3320). The RT reaction was initiated by incubating the mixture at 42 °C for 30 min. Once the first-strand cDNA was synthesized, the conditions were set for further PCR: 92 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. These settings were applied for 30 cycles. Protein Extracts, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot— Cells were washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed on ice with lysis solution (1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 50 mmol/liter HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mmol/liter NaCl) supplemented with 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 86 μg/ml iodoacetamide, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride as protease inhibitors. To obtain enriched membrane preparations, homogenates were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at ∼150,000 × g for 90 min. The pellet was resuspended in 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and protein content was determined by Bio-Rad protein assay. Samples were separated into aliquots and stored at -80 °C. Crude membrane protein samples (50 μg) were boiled in Laemmli SDS loading buffer and separated on 10% SDS-PAGE. They were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore) and blocked in 5% dry milk-supplemented 0.2% Tween 20 PBS before immunoreaction. Filters were immunoblotted with antibodies against Kv1.3 (1/200, Alomone) and Kv1.5 (1/500, Alomone). As a loading and transfer control, a monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody (1/5000, Sigma) was used. The specificity of Kv1.3 and Kv1.5 commercial antibodies was tested with control antigen peptides provided by the manufacturer. For immunoprecipitation studies, membrane pellets were resuspended in 1% Triton, 10% glycerol, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl incubated in the presence of protein A-Sepharose, and pelleted. Supernatants incubated overnight with anti-Kv1.3 antibody (Alomone) were further incubated with protein A-Sepharose, washed with 0.1% Triton/PBS, and centrifuged. Pellets were re-suspended in Laemmli SDS-loading buffer, boiled at 95 °C, and separated on 8% SDS-PAGE. To detect immunoprecipitated Kv1.5, an anti-Kv1.5 antibody (1/250) produced and characterized in the Tamkun laboratory was used. Densitometric analysis of the filters was performed by Phoretix software (Nonlinear Dynamics). Results are the mean ± S.E. of each experimental group. DNA Constructs, Cell Transfection, and Microinjection—Rat Kv1.3 cDNA, kindly donated by T. C. Holmes (New York University), was amplified by PCR and ligated into pEYFP-C1 (Clontech) by using BglII and HinDIII restriction sites. Human Kv1.5 cDNA was amplified by PCR and ligated into pECFP-C1 (Clontech) by using BglII and EcoRI. Both constructs were verified by sequencing. Raw 264.7 and HEK cells were grown on glass coverslips in 35-mm dishes, and transient transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) to near 80% confluency. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were washed with PBS, fixed, and mounted with Aqua Poly/Mount from Polysciences, Inc. X. laevis oocytes were prepared and injected by standard methods. Mature female frogs were purchased from the Centre d'Elevage de Xenopes (Montpellier, France). Animals were anesthetized in cold distilled water containing 1.7 g/liter tricaine(ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonic acid; Sigma). Ovarian sacs were extracted by sterile surgical procedures and placed in sterile Barth's solution (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 0.33 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 2.40 mm NaHCO3, and 20 mm HEPES at pH 7.5 supplemented with penicillin 100 IU/ml and streptomycin 0.1 mg/ml). Oocytes at stages V and VI were dissected out and kept at 15-16 °C in sterile Barth's solution. Full-length Kv1.3 and Kv1.5 were subcloned into pcDNA3. cRNAs were generated with T7 RNA polymerase by using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Ambion). Oocytes were injected with 10 ng of Kv1.3 or Kv1.5 of in vitro transcribed cRNAs to form homotetramers. Heterotetramers were expressed in oocytes injected with 10 ng of total cRNA of Kv1.3 and Kv1.5 in the proportions of 1:1, 3:1, and 1:3 using a Variable Nanoject (Drummond Scientific Co). Twenty-four hours after injection, the follicular cell layer was partially removed by incubation for 30 min with 0.25 mg/ml type-1A collagenase (Sigma). Oocytes were maintained at 15-16 °C in sterile Barth's solution, and recordings were made 3 days later. Confocal Imaging and Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) Experiment—Transient transfected cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, PBS for 10 min. Acceptor photobleaching method was used to measure the FRET. Fluorescent proteins from fixed cells were excited with the 458-nm or the 514-nm lines by low excitation intensities and 475-495-nm bandpass and >530-nm longpass emission filters, respectively. Subsequently, YFP protein was bleached by using maximum laser power, obtaining around 80% of acceptor intensity bleaching. After photobleaching images of the donor and acceptor were taken, FRET efficiency was calculated as ((FCFPafter - FCFPbefore)/FCFPafter) × 100, where FCFPafter is the intensity of fluorescence of donor after bleaching, and FCFPbefore is before bleaching. Loss of fluorescence intensity was corrected by measuring CFP intensity in the non-bleached part of the cell. The FRET values are expressed as the means ± S.E. of n > 10 cells for each population. Electron Microscopy—Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature and then replaced with 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Fixation was removed by washing with 0.02 m glycine in PBS. Cells were scraped and collected in Eppendorf tubes with 12% gelatin. After solidifying on ice, gelatin blocks were infiltrated in 2.3 m sucrose in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Blocks were frozen in liquid nitrogen. Ultrathin cryosections were obtained using Leica ULTRACUT EM FCS at -118 °C and subjected to immunogold labeling. Cryosections were incubated at room temperature on drops of 2% gelatin in phosphate buffer for 20 min at 37 °C followed by 50 mm glycine in PBS for 15 min and 5% normal goat serum in PBS for 10 min. Then they were incubated with anti-Kv1.5 or and anti-Kv1.3 polyclonal antibodies in 5% normal goat serum in PBS for 30 min. After 3 washes with drops of 5% normal goat serum in PBS for 20 min, sections were incubated for 60 min using IgG anti-rabbit coupled to 10-nm or to 15-nm diameter colloidal gold particles (Aurion) using a 1:60 dilution in 5% normal goat serum in PBS. This was followed by 3 washes with drops of PBS for 10 min and 2 washes with distilled water. As a control for nonspecific binding of the colloidal gold-conjugated antibody, the primary polyclonal antibody was omitted. Finally, the cryosections were contrasted and embedded in a mixture of methylcellulose and uranyl acetate. At the double immunogold, an immunolabeling with one of the primary antibodies was done. In the first immunolabeling procedure we used the secondary antibody conjugated with the small gold (10 nm). Then the inactivation of the anti-IgG binding sites, using 3% paraformaldehyde, 2% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 2 h, was performed (20Jensen H.L. Norrild B. Histochem. J. 1999; 8: 525-533Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). After inactivation the immunolabeling with the other primary antibody was done using in this case the secondary antibody conjugated to 15-nm gold particles. Primary antibody dilutions were 1:50 in both cases. Samples were viewed with a Jeol 1010 electron microscope. Electrophysiological Recordings—Whole-cell currents were measured with the patch clamp technique. An EPC-9 (HEKA) amplifier with the appropriate software was used for data recording and analysis. Currents were filtered at 2.9 kHz. Series resistance compensation was always above 70%. Patch electrodes of 2-4 megaohms were fabricated in a P-97 puller (Sutter Instruments Co.) from borosilicate glass (outer diameter of 1.2 mm and inner diameter of 0.94 mm; Clark Electromedical Instruments Co). Electrodes were filled with the 120 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 11 mm EGTA, 20 mm d-glucose adjusted to pH 7.3 with KOH. The extracellular solution contained 120 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 25 mm d-glucose adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. After establishment of a whole-cell configuration, macrophages were clamped to a holding potential of -60 mV, with seal resistances of at least 2.5 gigaohms. All recordings were routinely subtracted for leak currents at -50 mV online. Only cells with a series resistance compensation of 80-90% were selected for analysis. Uncompensated series resistances were 4-8 megaohms, as currents evoked were less than 1nA; voltage errors from uncompensated series resistance were less than 2 mV. To determine voltage dependence of steady-state activation, currents were elicited by 200-ms voltage pulses (-50 to +50 mV, Vh) from a holding potential Vh of -60 mV with 10-mV increments. To ensure complete recovery from inactivation, cells were repolarized for 45 s at -60 mV. After converting the steady-state peak outward currents (Ik) into conductances, Gk (Gk = Ik/(Vh-Ek); Ek, Nernst potential of K+ -79 mV), conductances at various membrane potentials were normalized to maximal conductance Gmax. G/Gmax was plotted versus Vh. The normalized G/Gmax versus voltage curve was fitted using the Boltzmann equation, G/Gmax = 1/(1 + exp((V1/2-V)/k)), where V1/2 is the voltage at which the current is half-activated, and k is the slope factor of the activation curve. To calculate inactivation time, constants (τ) cells were held at -60 mV, and pulse potentials of 4 s were applied. Inactivation adjustment was calculated from the peak of the current at 50 mV to the steady-state inactivation, and traces were fitted with Sigma Plot (SPSS Inc.). To analyze the cumulative inactivation, currents were elicited by a train of 8 depolarizing voltage steps of 200 ms to + 50 mV once every 400 ms. Oocytes were voltage-clamped with a two-electrode system, Gene Clamp 500 (Axon Instruments). The voltage and the current microelectrodes were filled with KCl (3 m) and had resistances ranging from 0.5 to 1 megaohms. The volume of the oocyte recording chamber was 200 μl. Recordings were done under constant bath perfusion (1 ml/min). The bath electrode was an Ag-AgCl pellet that made contact with the recording solution (115 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES at pH 7.4) through an agar bridge. Membrane potential and current were digitized through a PCI-MIO-16E-4 Multifunction I/O Board and NI-DAQ (National Instruments). The board was controlled by the Whole Cell Analysis Program (kindly provided by John Dempster, University of Strathclyde). The signal was filtered at twice the acquisition frequency. Oocytes were clamped to a holding potential of -60 mV. To evoke voltage-gated currents, all oocytes were stimulated with 1-s square pulses ranging from -80 mV to +80 mV in 10-mV steps. To ensure complete recovery from inactivation, oocytes were repolarized for 60 s at -60 mV. To calculate inactivation time constants (τ), pulse potentials of 5 s were applied. Inactivation adjustment was calculated from the peak of the current at + 80 mV to the steady-state inactivation, and traces were fitted with Sigma Plot (SPSS Inc.). Data were leak-subtracted using hyperpolarizing P/4 subtraction pulses. Data were analyzed by the Whole Cell Analysis program. To characterize the voltage-dependent outward K+ current pharmacologically, recombinant margatoxin (MgTx) was added to the external solution (8Vicente R. Escalada A. Coma M. Fuster G. Sanchez-Trillo E. Lopez-Iglesias C. Soler C. Solsona C. Celada A. Felipe A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278 (Correction (2005) J. Biol.

Solutions were perfused by gravity and controlled by electrovalves (ALA, Scientific Instruments). All recordings were performed at room temperature (20-23 °C). Statistics—Values are expressed as the mean ± S.E. The significance of differences was established by Student's t test or by analysis of variance (GraphPad, PRISM 4.0) where indicated. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. Macrophages Express Kv1.3 and Kv1.5 Channels—Voltage-dependent potassium currents were evoked in macrophages by depolarizing pulses. Fig. 1, A and B, show representative potassium currents in BMDM and Raw 264.7 macrophages, respectively. The current density (picoamperes/picofarads)/voltage relationships depicted in Fig. 1C indicate that currents in BMDM were 3-fold higher than in Raw cells. Fig. 1D shows the normalized conductance against the test potential. Although the threshold for activation was about -40 mV in BMDM, channels opened at -20 mV in Raw macrophages. Whereas k slopes were similar for both groups (18.3 ± 3 and 11.9 ± 2 for BMDM and Raw, respectively, n = 10), V1/2 values were significantly different (-7.2 ± 2 and 6.3 ± 2 mV for BMDM and Raw, respectively, p < 0.001, n = 10). Kv1.3 is the main voltage-dependent K+ channel in leukocytes (2Cahalan M.D. Wulff H. Chandy K.G. J. Clin. Immunol. 2001; 21: 235-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). This was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis in our cells. Fig. 1E shows that not only EL-4, a murine T-cell line, but also macrophages (BMDM and Raw) expressed Kv1.3. However, the presence of Kv1.5 was only observed in macrophages. Mouse brain and liver RNAs were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The presence of Kv1.5 protein in both myeloid cell lines was further confirmed by Western blot analysis performed in crude membrane preparations (Fig. 1F). Contrary to Kv1.5, Kv1.3 is highly sensible to specific toxins (21Gutman G.E. Chandy K.G. Grissmer S. Lazdunski M. Mckinnon D. Pardo L.A. Robertson G.A. Rudy B. Sanguinetti M.C. Stühmer W. Wang X. Pharmacol. Rev. 2005; 57: 473-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). K+ currents in BMDM are blocked by Kv1.3 inhibitors such as MgTx and ShK-Dap22 (8Vicente R. Escalada A. Coma M. Fuster G. Sanchez-Trillo E. Lopez-Iglesias C. Soler C. Solsona C. Celada A. Felipe A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278 (Correction (2005) J. Biol.

Immunol. 2005; 174: 4736-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, the presence of Kv1.5 indicates that either Kv1.5 forms homotetrameric complexes or Kv1.5 subunits are assembled with Kv1.3 in heterotetrameric structures that are sensitive to Kv1.3 toxins. Fig. 1G shows that K+ currents in both macrophage cell lines are inhibited by the presence of MgTx. The IC50 values were 50 ± 5.1 and 772 ± 40 pm for BMDM and Raw, respectively (p < 0.001, n = 10). MgTx does not block Kv1.5 (21Gutman G.E. Chandy K.G. Grissmer S. Lazdunski M. Mckinnon D. Pardo L.A. Robertson G.A. Rudy B. Sanguinetti M.C. Stühmer W. Wang X. Pharmacol. Rev. 2005; 57: 473-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Therefore, these results indicate that, although Kv1.5 is expressed, this subunit does not form homomeric channels in macrophages. However, Raw and BMDM may differ in the K+ channel complex composition since biophysical and pharmacological differences were evident. Co-localization experiments supported the pharmacological and biophysical data. Unfortunately, immunocytochemistry studies with anti-Kv1.3 and anti-Kv1.5 antibodies were unsuccessful, probably due to high levels of Fc receptors expressed in macrophages. However, since Raw cells ha"

Hsps are known to be regulated by heat shock factor (Hsf), but our results demonstrate an unexpected regulatory link between the oxygen-sensing and heat shock pathways. Hsf transcription is up-regulated during hypoxia due to direct binding by hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) to HIF-1 response elements in an Hsf intron. This increase in Hsf transcripts is necessary for full Hsp induction during hypoxia and reoxygenation. The HIF-1-dependent increase in Hsps has a functional impact, as reduced production of Hsps decreases viability of adult flies exposed to hypoxia and reoxygenation. Thus, HIF-1 control of Hsf transcriptional levels is a regulatory mechanism for sensitizing heat shock pathway activity in order to maximize production of protective Hsps. This cross-regulation represents a mechanism by which the low oxygen response pathway has assimilated complex new functions by regulating the key transcriptional activator of the heat shock pathway.

This cross-regulation represents a mechanism by which the low oxygen response pathway has assimilated complex new functions by regulating the key transcriptional activator of the heat shock pathway. In order to endure oxygen deprivation, most eukaryotes utilize a conserved set of cellular adaptations (1Semenza G.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 551-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar). Many of these changes are brought about by the activation of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), 2The abbreviations used are: HIF-1, hypoxia-inducible factor-1; Hsp, heat shock protein; Hsf, heat shock factor; RNAi, RNA interference; GFP, green fluorescent protein; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; HRE, hypoxia response element; RT-PCR, reverse transcription PCR. a heterodimeric complex composed of HIF-1α and HIF-1β subunits. When this complex is formed it binds to specific DNA enhancer sequences and regulates the activity of target genes. Both HIF-1α and HIF-1β are constitutively expressed in normal oxygen conditions (normoxia), but HIF-1α protein is quickly degraded before dimerization can occur with HIF-1β (2Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5105) Google Scholar). Normoxic HIF-1α degradation is mediated by a series of hydroxylations and ubiquitinations that tag HIF-1α for disposal through the proteasome (3Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar, 6Hon W.C. Wilson M.I. Harlos K. Claridge T.D. Schofield C.J. Pugh C.W. Maxwell P.H. Ratcliffe P.J. Stuart D.I. Jones E.Y. Nature. 2002; 417: 975-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). The HIF-1 complex transcriptionally regulates a wide array of genes involved in anaerobic metabolism, growth, proliferation, angiogenesis, and cell death (7Huang L.E. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19575-19578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 8Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar). This multifaceted control of cellular and organismal physiological pathways is exploited by solid tumors through the natural hypoxic environment caused by rapid growth or genetic alterations that stabilize HIF-1α (9Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 789-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (3359) Google Scholar). Overexpression or activation of HIF-1α is often seen in a wide array of cancers and is correlated with patient survival (10Semenza G.L. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: S62-S67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar), and studies have shown that targeting the HIF-1 pathway is a promising means of cancer therapy (11Semenza G.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (5371) Google Scholar, 12Pouyssegur J. Dayan F. Mazure N.M. Nature. 2006; 441: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1396) Google Scholar). Thus, HIF-1 is a central regulator of normal and pathological changes in response to low oxygen. Although many genes that are up-regulated during hypoxia are known to be regulated by HIF-1, there are also diverse sets of genes up-regulated that have not been linked to the actions of HIF-1. Among these are the highly conserved heat shock proteins (Hsps) that are highly up-regulated during hypoxia but have not been linked to HIF-1 regulation (13Shen C. Nettleton D. Jiang M. Kim S.K. Powell-Coffman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20580-20588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Hsps are known to act as cellular chaperones for proteins that are misfolded by cellular stresses (14Welch W.J. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1993; 339: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Heat shock factor (Hsf) was one of the first studied transcription factors, and its activation by stresses that promote the unfolding of proteins has been well characterized. When cells are unstressed Hsf is in a monomeric state, but cellular stress induces trimerization of the protein (15Westwood J.T. Clos J. Wu C. Nature. 1991; 353: 822-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 16Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). The trimeric form of Hsf activates transcription of downstream genes such as Hsps (17Pelham H.R. Cell. 1982; 30: 517-528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 18Orosz A. Wisniewski J. Wu C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7018-7030Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, this study identifies a novel mode of regulation of heat shock pathway activity during hypoxia through a HIF-1-dependent increase in Hsf transcript levels. This up-regulation of Hsf is necessary for the full increase of Hsp transcripts normally observed during hypoxia and also during reoxygenation. These findings establish a novel regulatory link between two stress pathways previously thought to be independent in responding to hypoxia. Cell Culture and Hypoxia Treatments—Drosophila melanogaster Kc167 tissue culture cells were obtained from the Drosophila Genomics Resource Center. Cells were maintained in Schneider's Drosophila medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). For hypoxia experiments, cells were incubated for 6 h in chambers flushed with 0.5% O2 gas. The reoxygenation step consisted of a 15-min return to normal oxygen levels. RNA Interference (RNAi)—RNAi was performed as previously reported (19Clemens J.C. Worby C.A. Simonson-Leff N. Muda M. Maehama T. Hemmings B.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6499-6503Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). The following primer pairs were used to generate template DNA: control green fluorescent protein (GFP) (5′-GCCACAAGTTCAGCGTGTCC and 5′-GCTTCTCGTTGGGGTCTTTC), HIF-1α (sima) (5′-CTGCGGGACTATCATAACAACC and 5′-AGGCTCAAAATCAATCTTTTGG), alternate HIF-1α (5′-GCATCACATCAAAGAGTCCCGAG and 5′-TCCGCAACCGTAACACCACTAC), and Hsf (5′-TGCCAAACAGTCCGCCTTATTAC and 5′-TGCTTTCCAAGTGCCCGTG). The T7 promoter sequence (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGA) was added 5′ to all above primers when ordered (IDT). Reverse Transcription PCR—Total RNA was isolated using standard TRIzol protocols. Instructions from the Superscript III One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum Taq (Invitrogen) were followed using 1 μg of total RNA, and 21 cycles of amplification were used for each test. The following primer pairs were used: HIF-1α (5′-CGAACTCGGTACTAAAGAACCTGC and 5′-GGGTCCTACTTTCACGCAAGG), Hsf (5′-ATCTGCTGCGTGGCGATG and 5′-CGTCCGTGTCCAAAATGTCG), Hsp26 (5′-ATGGCGTGCTCACCGTCAGTATTC and 5′-GGATGATGTTGGATGATGATGGCTC), Hsp27 (5′-AGGAGGAAGAAGACGACGAGATTCG and 5′-CATTGGGTGTGTTGTGGTGTGTCC), Hsp68 (5′-TTCACCACCTATGCCGACAACCAG and 5′-TCACATTCAGGATACCGTTTGCGTC), Hsp70Ab (5′-TCCATTCAGGTGTATGAGGGCG and 5′-CGTTCAGGATTCCATTGGCGTC), Hsp70Ba (5′-ACGATGCCAAGATGGACAAGGG and 5′-CGTCTGGGTTGATGGATAGGTTGAG), and Actin5c (5′-GGATGGTCTTGATTCTGCTGG and 5′-AGGTGGTTCCGCTCTTTTC). Real-time PCR—Total RNA was isolated using standard TRIzol protocols. cDNA was synthesized following the Super-Script III Reverse Transcriptase protocol (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR was performed using the Sybr Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and an ABI PRISM 7900HT detection system (Applied Biosystems). The supplied analysis software was used for data interpretation. The following primer pairs were used: Hsf (5′-ACACCGCAGCCTCACATTATGACC and 5′-ATTTCCCTGGAGCAGCAAGTCCTC), Hsp27 (5′-AGGAGGAAGAAGACGACGAGATTCG and 5′-CATTGGGTGTGTTGTGGTGTGTCC), Hsp68 (5′-TTCACCACCTATGCCGACAACCAG and 5′-TCACATTCAGGATACCGTTTGCGTC), Hsp70Ab (5′-TCCATTCAGGTGTATGAGGGCG and 5′-CGTTCAGGATTCCATTGGCGTC), Hsp70Ba (5′-ACGATGCCAAGATGGACAAGGG and 5′-CGTCTGGGTTGATGGATAGGTTGAG), and Actin5c (5′-TGCTGGAGGAGGAGGAGGAGAAGTC and 5′-GCAGGTGGTTCGCTCTTTTCATC). Hypoxia Reporter Construction—A small region of the Hsf intron containing the possible hypoxia regulatory elements was cloned into the Green H Pelican reporter vector. Kc167 cells were transfected using the Effectene kit (Qiagen) with this reporter and put in normoxia, hypoxia, or hypoxia with HIF-1α RNAi. Images were taken using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U microscope and MetaVue image capture software. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Kc167 cells were transfected using the Effectene kit (Qiagen) with a pAc5.1/Sima plasmid that contains the full-length HIF-1α (sima) cDNA sequence with a c-terminal V5 epitope tag under the control of the Actin5c promoter. An equal quantity of mock transfected cells was used as a control, and all purification steps were carried out in parallel with the control and experimental cells. 24 h after transfection, control and experimental cells were incubated in hypoxia at room temperature for 24 h. DNA isolation and purification procedures followed standard V5 protocol. PCR was used to detect Hsf, Hph, and Actin5c genomic regions in each of the samples of isolated DNA. 35 cycles were used to amplify 2 μl of template from each sample using the following primers: Hsf (5′-CTCCCACCACATACCGCTAATC and 5′-AAAAGCCAACTGAATGACCAAGG), Hph (5′-CCTTCTCACACTCCCTTCGCTG and 5′-CACTCTCTGCCAAGCCAAACC), Actin5c (5′-TGTGTGTGAGAGAGCGAAAGCC and 5′-CTGGAATAAACCGACTGAAAGTGG). Larval Survival—First instar larvae of wild-type or flies with only one copy of the Hsf gene were counted and placed 10/vial of food. These vials were split and placed into groups for normoxic or hypoxia and reoxygenation stresses. This experimental group was maintained at 0.5% oxygen for 23 h and then placed in ambient oxygen for 1 h before returning to hypoxia. This cycle was repeated daily, and after 2 weeks the vials were scored for survival. Hsf Transcript Levels Increase during Hypoxia in a HIF-1α-dependent Manner—D. melanogaster Kc167 cells were treated with GFP control double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) or dsRNA directed to eliminate transcripts of the Drosophila HIF-1α homologue, similar (20Nambu J.R. Chen W. Hu S. Crews S.T. Gene. 1996; 172: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 21Lavista-Llanos S. Centanin L. Irisarri M. Russo D.M. Gleadle J.M. Bocca S.N. Muzzopappa M. Ratcliffe P.J. Wappner P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6842-6853Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), through RNAi. After exposure of the treated cells to normoxic or hypoxic conditions, total RNA was isolated for semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR in order to characterize the transcript levels of HIF-1α, Hsf, and Actin5c as a control (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, we found that transcript levels of Hsf increased during hypoxia and that this up-regulation was HIF-1α dependent. Cells lacking HIF-1α due to RNAi did not display a hypoxic increase in Hsf, instead maintaining Hsf levels more similar to control normoxic cells. Real-time PCR was then used to more accurately characterize these results (Fig. 1B) and further corroborated that Hsf transcripts increase under hypoxic conditions in a HIF-1α-dependent manner. As an additional control we repeated the RNAi with an alternate dsRNA sequence targeting another area of HIF-1α, which also showed a HIF-1α-dependent hypoxic increase of Hsf (Fig. 1C). This control experiment confirms our results were not due to off-target effects of the original RNAi. The Increase in Hsf Transcript Levels during Hypoxia Is Directly Regulated by HIF-1α—The DNA recognition element to which HIF-1 binds during hypoxia contains a core 5′-RCGTG sequence (22Semenza G.L. Jiang B.H. Leung S.W. Passantino R. Concordet J.P. Maire P. Giallongo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32529-32537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar). We had identified multiple instances of a related motif, 5′-TACGTGC, in the intron of the known HIF-1 target gene (23Aprelikova O. Chandramouli G.V. Wood M. Vasselli J.R. Riss J. Maranchie J.K. Linehan W.M. Barrett J.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 92: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) HIF-1 prolyl hydroxylase and searched for this motif in the Hsf gene region. We identified two of these putative hypoxia response elements (HREs) in close proximity to one another in the second intron of Hsf. The two sites were 923 and 992 base pairs downstream from the transcriptional start site of Hsf, respectively. When this genomic region was aligned (24Bray N. Pachter L. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) with seven other Drosophila species these potential HREs were perfectly conserved (Fig. 2A). The sequence conservation of the two HRE motifs strongly suggests that there is evolutionary pressure to maintain these specific sequences. We next tested whether these conserved HRE motifs had a regulatory function during hypoxia. A portion of the second intron of Hsf containing the potential HREs was cloned upstream of a minimal promoter driving GFP in the Green H Pelican reporter vector (25Barolo S. Carver L.A. Posakony J.W. BioTechniques. 2000; 29: 726-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). This reporter construct was then transfected into the Kc167 cell line and put under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. The hypoxic cells showed a dramatic increase in GFP fluorescence compared with the normoxic cells (Fig. 2B). The hypoxic increase in GFP expression was eliminated by HIF-1α RNAi treatment. The original reporter vector lacking the Hsf intron showed no hypoxic activation of GFP (data not shown), confirming that it was the cloned intronic region of Hsf that was leading to the HIF-1-dependent induction of the reporter during hypoxia. The HRE-containing region was also tested by chromatin immunoprecipitation for direct binding by HIF-1. We transfected Kc167 cells with an epitope-tagged HIF-1α expression vector (26Gorr T.A. Tomita T. Wappner P. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36048-36058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). DNA bound to HIF-1 protein during hypoxia was immunoprecipitated, and the Hsf intron genomic region as well as control genomic regions were PCR amplified to test for enrichment compared with DNA immunoprecipitated from a mock transfection. We found distinct enrichment of a 260-bp fragment encompassing the two HREs of the Hsf intron (Fig. 2C). As a positive control we showed an enrichment of a genomic region containing an HRE within the intron of the known HIF-1 target Hph. A negative control fragment located in an Actin5c intron showed no enrichment between the HIF-1α pulldown and the untransfected pulldown. These data indicate that Hsf is a direct target of HIF-1α through the binding of an intronic region containing two HREs that act as an enhancer of transcription during hypoxia. Full Induction of Hsps during Hypoxia Is Dependent on HIF-1α Regulation of Hsf—The functional impact of the up-regulation of Hsf by HIF-1α on Hsp induction during hypoxia was then assayed. Kc167 cells were exposed to normoxia and hypoxia after treatment with control and HIF-1α RNAi, and reverse transcription PCR assayed transcript levels of various Hsps. All Hsps examined were dramatically up-regulated under hypoxia, and this increase was partly HIF-1α dependent (Fig. 3A). Hsp transcripts were not completely eliminated in hypoxic cells treated with HIF-1α dsRNA, presumably because the hypoxic stress activated the basal (normoxic) levels of Hsf protein already present in the cells. No HREs were found near any of the Hsp genes; therefore it is unlikely that HIF-1 was directly up-regulating these genes during hypoxia. We tested whether the up-regulation of Hsps during hypoxia was dependent on Hsf. Cells were treated with control or Hsf RNAi and placed in normoxic and hypoxic conditions. When Hsf was removed through RNAi, Hsp transcripts were eliminated completely compared with the strong induction seen in cells treated with control dsRNA (Fig. 3B). Real-time PCR was used to more accurately quantify the results from both of the RNAi experiments. HIF-1α RNAi reduced the up-regulation of Hsps during hypoxia, yet Hsf RNAi completely removed Hsp transcripts (Fig. 3C). From these results, we can discern that Hsf regulates Hsps, while HIF-1 regulates Hsf. The lack of strong Hsp up-regulation in hypoxic HIF-1 knockdown cells suggests that the HIF-1-mediated increase in Hsf transcript levels is an important step in regulating the sensitivity and activity of the heat shock response pathway. The functional impact of an increase in Hsf transcript levels in hypoxia was tested by assaying the response to hypoxia of a fly heterozygous for the null Hsf1 mutation (27Jedlicka P. Mortin M.A. Wu C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2452-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and therefore containing only a single wild-type copy of Hsf. After exposure to hypoxia, these flies had reduced levels of Hsf transcripts compared with wild-type Oregon R flies as measured by real-time PCR (Fig. 4). The heterozygous flies with a reduction in Hsf transcripts also showed a strong reduction in Hsp26, Hsp27, and Hsp68 transcript levels compared with the control flies, although two Hsp70 genes had normal levels of induction. These findings suggest that Hsf abundance impacts the up-regulation of some Hsps in a dose-dependent manner during hypoxia. Lower Hsf transcript abundance than the levels normally achieved during hypoxia are insufficient for the full up-regulation of Hsps. Full Induction of Hsps and Viability during Reoxygenation Is Dependent on Increased Hsf Levels—During the return to normal oxygen conditions, Hsp levels remain high and are critical to tissue survival during this reoxygenation (28Donnelly T.J. Sievers R.E. Vissern F.L. Welch W.J. Wolfe C.L. Circulation. 1992; 85: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 29Kabakov A.E. Budagova K.R. Bryantsev A.L. Latchman D.S. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2003; 8: 335-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The effect of the HIF-1-dependent increase in Hsf level on Hsp expression persists during reoxygenation. Kc167 tissue culture cells with HIF-1α knocked down by RNAi had little increase in Hsp expression after hypoxia treatment and a reoxygenation period (Fig. 5A). Thus, the up-regulation of Hsf during hypoxia is critical to the high levels of Hsp transcripts during reoxygenation, as well as hypoxia. Furthermore, we examined the functional importance in vivo of increased Hsf transcript abundance by assaying larval survival under hypoxia and reoxygenation stress. First instar larvae were reared in a regimen of alternating hypoxia and reoxygenation. The Hsf1 heterozygotes had greatly reduced survival compared with larvae reared in normoxia (Fig. 5B). Control wild-type larvae showed no significant difference in survival between normoxia and the hypoxia and reoxygenation environments. These findings demonstrate the dosage importance of Hsf transcript levels for coping with hypoxia and reoxygenation at the organismal level. Taken together, these experiments show the sequential order and importance of the hypoxia response. During hypoxia, HIF-1 directly up-regulates Hsf, which in turn up-regulates the whole family of Hsps. Without the HIF-1-regulated increase in Hsf, Hsps transcript levels never reach full induction during hypoxia or reoxygenation and organismal viability is reduced. Up-regulation of Hsps during hypoxia is part of the canonical low oxygen stress response seen in Drosophila (30Liu G. Roy J. Johnson E.A. Physiol. Genomics. 2006; 25: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), Caenorhabditis elegans (13Shen C. Nettleton D. Jiang M. Kim S.K. Powell-Coffman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20580-20588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and mammalian tissues (31Morimoto R.I. Science. 1993; 259: 1409-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar). This study provides evidence that the up-regulation of Hsf during hypoxia surprisingly requires the activity of HIF-1, the effector of the low oxygen response. The transcriptional control of Hsf by HIF-1 has a functional impact on the activity of the heat shock response during hypoxia and the return to normal oxygen levels. Cells lacking HIF-1 or with reduced dosage of Hsf only increase Hsp transcript production slightly during low oxygen exposure and reoxygenation. The decreased production of Hsps reduces viability in flies experiencing hypoxia and reoxygenation, demonstrating that the full induction of the heat shock response is essential to counter the diverse physiological stresses associated with low oxygen. Thus, we propose a model where HIF-1 directly up-regulates Hsf during hypoxia and the increased Hsf abundance in turn allows Hsf to further up-regulate Hsps during low oxygen exposure and also after the return to normal oxygen levels. The regulation of Hsf by HIF-1 provides a clear example of how cross-regulation between physiological stress response pathways can allow one pathway to sensitize the second and elicit a response under conditions where normally it would not be activated. Complex Regulation of Physiological Response Pathways— Cross-regulation between physiological pathways appears to be a feature of the low oxygen response. It has been shown that the insulin pathway can dramatically affect the HIF-1 pathway (32Zelzer E. Levy Y. Kahana C. Shilo B.Z. Rubinstein M. Cohen B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5085-5094Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Through the actions of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway, HIF-1α translation is increased in a manner that outpaces the naturally normoxic degradation of HIF-1α (33Mottet D. Dumont V. Deccache Y. Demazy C. Ninane N. Raes M. Michiels C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31277-31285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). This leads to HIF-1 activation even when oxygen is present and up-regulating its downstream targets. Recently it has been shown that transforming growth factor-β1 activates the HIF-1 pathway by reducing the levels of prolyl hydroxylases that tag HIF-1α for degradation. Interestingly, it is also known that Hsp90 plays a role in stabilizing HIF-1α (34Minet E. Mottet D. Michel G. Roland I. Raes M. Remacle J. Michiels C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 35Isaacs J.S. Jung Y.J. Mimnaugh E.G. Martinez A. Cuttitta F. Neckers L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29936-29944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). This mechanism is independent of the canonical oxygen-dependent regulation of HIF-1α and was the first evidence of any link between the heat shock and hypoxia stress pathways. The cross-regulation between HIF-1 and Hsf found here is a new type of control, where the transcriptional effector of the low oxygen response directly regulates the transcript level of the effector of the heat shock response in order to sensitize the pathway. Interestingly, it has been already shown that HIF-1 and Hsf pathways have regulatory interactions, but in response to heat. Studies using C. elegans and rats showed that HIF-1 activity was essential for heat acclimation (36Treinin M. Shliar J. Jiang H. Powell-Coffman J.A. Bromberg Z. Horowitz M. Physiol. Genomics. 2003; 14: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 37Maloyan A. Eli-Berchoer L. Semenza G.L. Gerstenblith G. Stern M.D. Horowitz M. Physiol. Genomics. 2005; 23: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Our findings may explain the mechanism behind this phenomenon in that the increase in metabolic activity during high temperature may cause oxygen scarcity, thus stabilizing HIF-1 and increasing Hsf transcript levels. Transcriptional Control of the Heat Shock Response—The activity of the heat shock pathway has been shown to be controlled by the trimerization and post-translational modification of Hsf protein subunits (18Orosz A. Wisniewski J. Wu C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7018-7030Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that transcriptional control of Hsf is a means of further regulation of heat shock pathway activity. This transcriptional regulatory step is controlled by HIF-1, supporting a model in which the HIF-1 pathway causes increased Hsf transcription during hypoxia as a means to increase the cellular abundance of Hsf and increase the sensitivity of the heat shock pathway. In addition, the control of heat shock response sensitivity by HIF-1, the regulator of the low oxygen response, suggests that stress response pathways can assimilate complex new functions by regulating the transcriptional activators of other stress pathways. Disease Implications—It has been shown that the increases in Hsp levels are critical for cell survival during hypoxia and the subsequent reoxygenation (29Kabakov A.E. Budagova K.R. Bryantsev A.L. Latchman D.S. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2003; 8: 335-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 38Nakano M. Mann D.L. Knowlton A.A. Circulation. 1997; 95: 1523-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that it is through the HIF-1 pathway that the cell achieves this Hsp increase and is a means to protect against the stress of hypoxia. HIF-1 accumulation and activity have been linked to tumor progression, and various Hsps have also been shown to be crucial to cancer survival (39Ciocca D.R. Calderwood S.K. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2005; 10: 86-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar); thus, the hypoxic and heat shock response pathways play important roles in the pathophysiology of cancer. Our finding that the activity of HIF-1 controls the output of the heat shock pathway offers possible therapeutic approaches for mitigating hypoxic tissue damage and tumor growth by targeting this novel regulatory link.

PKGIα is present in the heart, although its role in protection against ischemia/reperfusion injury is not known. We investigated the direct effect of PKGIα against necrosis and apoptosis following simulated ischemia (SI) and reoxygenation (RO) in cardiomyocytes. Adult rat cardiomyocytes were infected with adenoviral vectors containing hPKGIα or catalytically inactive mutant hPKGIαK390A. After 24 h, the cells were subjected to 90 min of SI and 2 h RO for necrosis (trypan blue exclusion and lactate dehydrogenase release) or 18 h RO for apoptosis studies. To evaluate the role of KATP channels, subgroups of cells were treated with 5-hydroxydecanoate (100 μm), HMR1098 (30 μm), or glibenclamide (50 μm), the respective blockers of mitochondrial, sarcolemmal, or both types of KATP channels prior to SI. The necrosis observed in 33.7 ± 1.6% of total myocytes in the SI-RO control group was reduced to 18.6 ± 0.8% by PKGIα (mean ± S.E., n = 7, p < 0.001). The apoptosis observed in 17.9 ± 1.3% of total myocytes in the SI-RO control group was reduced to 6.0 ± 0.6% by PKGIα (mean ± S.E., n = 7, p < 0.001). In addition, PKGIα inhibited the activation of caspase-3 after SI-RO in myocytes. Myocytes infected with the inactive PKGIαK390A mutant showed no protection. PKGIα enhanced phosphorylation of Akt, ERK1/2, and JNK, increased Bcl-2, inducible nitric-oxide synthase, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase, and decreased Bax expression. 5-Hydroxydecanoate and glibenclamide abolished PKGIα-mediated protection against necrosis and apoptosis. However, HMR1098, had no effect. A scavenger of reactive oxygen species, as well as inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, ERK, JNK1, and NOS, also blocked PKGIα-mediated protection against necrosis and apoptosis.

A number of receptors and intracellular signaling pathways have been identified that play an essential role in the cardioprotective effect of preconditioning. Endogenously released agents including adenosine, norepinephrine, opioids, free radicals, and bradykinin are involved in preconditioning (5Yellon D.M. Downey J.M. Physiol.

Nevertheless, the direct role of PKGIα and the downstream signaling pathways that lead to protection of cardiomyocytes against apoptosis after ischemia/reoxygenation injury remain to be elucidated.PKGI has a number of effects that may be relevant to its regulation of apoptosis. PKGI can modulate gene expression in a variety of cell types by either stimulating or inhibiting extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (18Hofmann F. Ammendola A. Schlossmann J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1671-1676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Pilz R.B. Casteel D.E. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 1034-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar).

The present study was designed to examine whether the expression of PKGIα protects cardiomyocytes from necrosis and apoptosis following simulated ischemia and reoxygenation. We also examined whether opening of mitoKATP channel, ROS generation and activation of multiple signaling pathways including Akt, NOS, and MAPKs are essential to PKG-mediated cellular protection. Our findings define mechanisms by which PKGIα inhibits necrosis and apoptosis signaling pathways to protect cardiomyocytes from ischemia/reperfusion injury.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIsolation of Ventricular Cardiomyocytes and Adenoviral Infection— Adult male Wistar rats (300 g) were purchased from Harlan Sprague-Dawley Inc. (Indianapolis, IN). The animal experimental protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Virginia Common-wealth University. Ventricular cardiomyocytes were isolated using an enzymatic technique as previously reported (13Das A. Xi L. Kukreja K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12944-12955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The freshly isolated cardiomyocytes were plated with Medium 199 containing 2 mm l-carnitine, 5 mm creatine, 5 mm taurine, 5 mm glucose, 0.1 μm insulin, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. After 1 h of plating, the myocytes were infected with adenoviral vectors containing hPKGIα (Ad.PKGIα) (24Begum N. Sandu O.A. Ito M. Lohmann S.M. Smolenski A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6214-6222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) or catalytically inactive hPKGIαK390A (25Smolenski A. Poller W. Walter U. Lohmann S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25723-25732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) in serum-free growth medium for 24 h. The cells were routinely infected with the viruses at a concentration of 1 × 103 particles/cell.Simulated Ischemia/Reoxygenation Protocol—After 24 h of adenoviral infection, the cells were subjected to simulated ischemia (SI) for 90 min by replacing the cell medium with an “ischemia buffer” that contained 118 mm NaCl, 24 mm NaHCO3, 1.0 mm NaH2PO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2-2H2O, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 20 mm sodium lactate, 16 mm KCl, 10 mm 2-deoxyglucose (pH adjusted to 6.2) as reported previously (13Das A. Xi L. Kukreja K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12944-12955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated at 37 °C in tri-gas incubator adjusting 1-2% O2 and 5% CO2 during the entire SI period. RO was accomplished by replacing the ischemic buffer with normal cell medium under normoxic conditions. Cell necrosis and apoptosis were assessed after 2 or 18 h of reoxygenation, respectively.Evaluation of Cell Viability and Apoptosis—Trypan blue exclusion assay and lactate dehydrogenase release into the medium were used to assess cell necrosis (13Das A. Xi L. Kukreja K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12944-12955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Cardiomyocyte apoptosis was analyzed by TUNEL staining as reported previously (13Das A. Xi L. Kukreja K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12944-12955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar).Detection of Activated Caspase 3—Activated caspase was detected using the CaspaTagTM Caspase 3,7 in situ assay kit (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions (13Das A. Xi L. Kukreja K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12944-12955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar).Inhibitor Studies—Each experiment was started with a change of medium in the wells. To evaluate the involvement of KATP channels in PKG1α-mediated protection, Ad.P-KGIα-infected cells were treated for 30 min before SI-RO with 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD, 100 μm), HMR1098 (30 μm), or glibenclamide (Glib, 50 μm), the respective blockers of mitochondrial, sarcolemmal, or sarcolemmal/mitoKATP channels. To test the effect of a ROS scavenger on PKG-induced protection, a subgroup of cells were treated with N-(2 mercaptopropionyl)glycine (MPG, 1 mm) for 30 min prior to SI-RO. Other subgroups of cells were treated similarly with the NOS inhibitor l-nitro-amino-methyl-ester (l-NAME, 100 μm), PI 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin (100 nm) and LY-294002 (10 μm), the ERK inhibitor PD-98059 (25 μm), and the JNK inhibitor SP600125 (10 μm).Western Blot Analysis—Western blots were performed as described previously (13Das A. Xi L. Kukreja K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12944-12955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The blots were incubated with rabbit polyclonal primary antibody or mouse monoclonal antibody at a dilution of 1:1000 for each of the respective proteins, i.e. PKGIα, nNOS, iNOS, eNOS, Bcl-2, Bax, pAkt, Akt, pERK, ERK1, pp38, p38, pJNK, JNK, and actin (all purchased from Santa Cruz) for 2 h. The membranes were then incubated with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2000 dilution; Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h. The blots were developed using a chemiluminescent system, and the bands were scanned and quantified by densitometric analysis.Data Analysis and Statistics—The data are presented as the means ± S.E. The difference between the groups was analyzed respectively with an unpaired t test or one-way analysis of variance followed by Student-Newman-Keul post-hoc test. p < 0.001 was considered to be statistically significant.RESULTSPKGIα Overexpression Inhibits Necrosis and Apoptosis—Fig. 1A shows a typical preparation of our isolated adult rat cardiomyocytes. At least 90% of the cardiomyocytes had rod-shaped morphology. After SI (90 min)-RO (2 h), the percentage of necrotic, trypan blue-positive cardiomyocytes increased to 33.7 ± 1.6 as compared with non-SI-RO controls (2.0 ± 0.2) (n = 7; p < 0.001; Fig. 1, A, B, and E). PKGIα expression in cardiomyocytes exposed to SI-RO reduced trypan blue-positive cardiomyocytes (n = 7; p < 0.001 versus SI-RO alone; Fig. 1, C and E). The overexpression of catalytically inactive PKGIαK390A failed to protect cells (Fig. 1, D and E). Similarly, PKGIα overexpression attenuated the release of lactate dehydrogenase as compared with SI-RO alone, whereas cardiomyocytes overexpressing PKGIαK390A did not (Fig. 1F).Apoptosis was not detectable after 90 min of SI and 2 h of RO. With an extended RO period of 18 h, TUNEL-positive cells increased as compared with the control group (p < 0.001 versus control, n = 7; Fig. 2, A and G). PKGIα overexpression reduced the TUNEL-positive cells (n = 7; p < 0.001 versus SI-RO group; Fig. 2, B and G), whereas PKGIαK390A failed to do so (Fig. 2, C and G). Representative staining of total nuclei with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole is shown for SI-RO control (Fig. 2D) and cells overexpressing PKGIα (Fig. 2E) or PKGIαK390A (Fig. 2F). Likewise, the red fluorescence of active caspase-positive cells increased in cardiomyocytes following SI and 18 h of RO (Fig. 2I) as compared with the control group (Fig. 2H), however clearly reduced by PKGIα overexpression (Fig. 2J) but not by PKGIαK390A (Fig. 2K). Representative panels (Fig. 2, L-O) show that 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining of total nuclei was more or less similar in three groups, suggesting that the observed changes in caspase-3 staining represented true differences in apoptosis, not the number of nuclei. Quantitative measurements showed that the active caspase-positive cardiomyocytes are significantly higher in SI-RO-treated control (25. 6 ± 0.6%) and PKGIαK390A cardiomyocytes (26.3 ± 0.7%) as compared with the cells overexpressing PKG1α (7.2 ± 0.5%) (p < 0.001, n = 7; Fig. 2P). Nonischemic group showed only 1.3 ± 0.1% (n = 7) of the caspase-positive cardiomyocytes.FIGURE 2PKGIα inhibits apoptosis in cardiomyocytes. Apoptotic nuclei were observed using TUNEL assay after 90 min of SI and 18 h of RO in cardiomyocytes with no adenoviral transfection (A and D), with overexpression of PKGIα (B and E) or catalytically inactive PKGIαK390A (C and F).

Similarly, Glib and 5-HD blocked PKGIα protection against apoptosis, as demonstrated by an increase in TUNEL-positive cells (p < 0.001 versus PKGIα; n = 3; Fig. 3B). HMR1098 failed to block the protective effect of PKGIα against necrosis (Fig. 3A) as well as apoptosis (Fig. 3B) (p > 0.05 versus PKGIα; n = 3), ruling out a role of sarcolemmal KATP channels in PKGIα-induced protection. Glib, 5-HD, and HMR1098 had no effect on necrotic or apoptotic cell death after SI-RO in control or PKGIαK390A-expressing cardiomyocytes, thereby ruling out any potential PKG-independent effects of these agents. MPG abolished protective effects of PKGIα, i.e. increased the percentage of trypan blue-positive cells (Fig. 3A) and TUNEL-positive nuclei (Fig. 3B) after SI-RO, suggesting a role for ROS in PKGI-dependent cardiomyocyte protection.FIGURE 3Effect of KATP channel blockers and ROS scavenger on PKGIα-induced cardiomyocyte protection. 24 h after infection with PKGIα, cardiomyocytes were treated with 5-HD (100μm), HMR1098 (HMR,30μm), or Glib (50 μm) for 30 min before SI-RO. Another subgroup of cells was treated with MPG (1 mm) for 30 min before SI-RO. A, cell necrosis as determined by trypan blue-positive cells after 90 min of SI and 2 h of RO; B, apoptotic nuclei identified using TUNEL assay after 90 min of SI and 18 h of RO.

PKGIα overexpression increased the phosphorylation of Akt as compared with control (without infection) and PKGIαK390A in cardiomyocytes (Fig. 4, A and B). No further increases in Akt phosphorylation were observed when cardiomyocytes were subjected to SI and 15 or 30 min of reoxygenation following transfection with PKGIα (data not shown). Wortmannin and LY-294002 increased the percentage of trypan blue-positive cardiomyocytes from 18.1 ± 0.3 (PKGIα overexpression group) to 33.5 ± 0.6 and 34.7 ± 0.9, respectively (n = 3; p < 0.001; Fig. 4C). The number of TUNEL-positive nuclei was also increased from 6.8 ± 0.8 (in PKGIα overexpression group) to 23.5 ± 0.2 and 23.8 ± 1.0 by wortmannin and LY-294002, respectively (n = 3; p < 0.001; Fig. 4D). Wortmannin and LY-294002 had no effect on necrosis or apoptosis in control or PKGIαK390A-overexpressing cardiomyocytes exposed to SI-RO.FIGURE 4Role of Akt phosphorylation in PKGIα-induced cardiomyocyte protection. A, representative Western blots showing expression of phosphorylated Akt and total Akt after 24 h of infection with PKGIα or PKGIαK390A. B, bar diagram showing average ratio of p-Akt to total Akt. PKGIα expression increased significantly compared with control (without infection) and PKGIαK390A expression. Treatment with wortmannin (Wort, 100 nm) or LY-294002 (LY, 10 μm) before SI-RO abolished PKG-dependent protection. C, cell necrosis is determined by trypan blue-positive cells after 90 min of SI and 2 h of RO. D, apoptotic nuclei identified using TUNEL assay after 90 min of SI and 18 h of RO. Note that wortmannin and LY-294002 abolished PKGIα-induced protection against necrosis and apoptosis.

PKGIα overexpression clearly increased iNOS, eNOS, and Bcl-2 expression as compared with the control cells or cells infected with PKGIαK390A (Fig. 5, A and B). However, Bax was significantly decreased with overexpression of PKGIα as compared with control and PKGIαK390A-overexpressing cells (Fig. 5, A and B). No increase in nNOS was observed after PKGIα or PKGIαK390A overexpression as compared with control cells (Fig. 5, A and B). Similar results were obtained when cardiomyocytes were subjected to SI and 15 or 30 min of reoxygenation following transfection with PKGIα (data not shown).FIGURE 5Effect of PKGIα on expression of NOS isoforms, Bax, and Bcl-2.

Excitation of the mutual orbit will stimulate complex fluctuations in the orbit and rotation of both components, inducing the attitude of the smaller component to have large variation within some orbits and to hardly vary within others. The primary's proximity to its rotational stability limit suggests an origin from spin-up and disruption of a loosely bound precursor within the past million years."
https://openalex.org/W1991330040,"Itch is a ubiquitin ligase that has been implicated in the regulation of a number of cellular processes. We previously have identified Itch as a binding partner for the endocytic protein Endophilin and found it to be localized to endosomes. Using affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry, we have now identified the ubiquitin-protease FAM/USP9X as a binding partner of Itch. The association between Itch and FAM/USP9X was confirmed in vitro by glutathione S-transferase pulldown and in vivo through coimmunoprecipation. Itch and FAM partially colocalize in COS-7 cells at the trans-Golgi network and in peripheral vesicles. We mapped the FAM-binding domain on Itch to the WW domains, a region known to be involved in substrate recognition. However, transient overexpression of FAM/USP9X resulted in the deubiquitylation of Itch. Moreover, we show that Itch auto-ubiquitylation leads to its degradation in the proteasome. By examining the amounts of Itch and FAM in various cell lines and rat tissues, a positive correlation was found in the expression of both proteins. This observation suggests that the levels of FAM expression could have an influence on Itch in cells. Experimental decrease in FAM levels by RNA interference leads to a significant reduction in intracellular levels of endogenous Itch, which can be prevented by treatment with the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin. Accordingly, overexpression of FAM/USP9X resulted in a marked increase in endogenous Itch levels.

These results demonstrate an intriguing interplay between a ubiquitin ligase and a ubiquitin protease, based on direct interaction between the two proteins. The ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic pathway has been implicated in multiple cellular processes, including endocytosis, cell cycle regulation, transcriptional activation, and antigen presentation. Polyubiquitylated proteins are recognized and degraded by the proteasome, a multisubunit protein degradation complex (1Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2857) Google Scholar). Protein ubiquitylation also serves regulatory functions in the cell that do not involve proteasome-mediated degradation. For example ligand-induced ubiquitylation of the Ste2 receptor in yeast triggers receptor endocytosis and targeting to vacuoles (2Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Similarly, ubiquitylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 5The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; PRD, proline-rich domain; USP, ubiquitin-specific protease(s); siRNA, small interfering RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; MS/MS, mass spectrometry; CL, cell lysate(s); JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; WT, wild type. 5The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; PRD, proline-rich domain; USP, ubiquitin-specific protease(s); siRNA, small interfering RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; MS/MS, mass spectrometry; CL, cell lysate(s); JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; WT, wild type. triggers its degradation in lysosomes after trafficking in the endosomal compartments (3Katzmann D.J. Odorizzi G. Emr S.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 893-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). The ubiquitin ligase Itch belongs to the Nedd4/Rsp5p HECT domain-containing family of E3 ligases characterized by a number of regions that are involved in intracellular localization and protein-protein interactions, which include an N-terminal C2 domain, four WW domains, and a C-terminal HECT domain (Fig. 1A). The N-terminal Itch C2 domain is responsible for its intracellular localization to endosomes (4Angers A. Ramjaun A.R. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11471-11479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar); the WW domains are responsible for the recognition of several substrate proteins (e.g. Refs. 5Chang L. Kamata H. Solinas G. Luo J.L. Maeda S. Venuprasad K. Liu Y.C. Karin M. Cell. 2006; 124: 601-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 12Qiu L. Joazeiro C. Fang N.

Huang Q.H. Zhang Q.H. Wang Z.G. Li B.L. Chen Z. Chen S.J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3385-3394Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Previously we have demonstrated that Endophilin A1, an Src homology 3 (SH3) domain-containing protein that functions in clathrin-mediated endocytosis is a substrate for Itch. Interestingly, Itch does not interact with Endophilin via its WW domains; rather through a short 18-amino acid proline-rich domain (PRD) (4Angers A. Ramjaun A.R. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11471-11479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Because of the prominent role of ubiquitylation in endocytosis and our observation that both Itch and Endophilin are highly expressed in the brain, we performed pulldown experiments from rat brain extracts to identify novel substrates of Itch. Interestingly, one of the protein bands isolated was identified as the ubiquitin specific protease FAM, also known as USP9X. Ubiquitin proteases, or deubiquitylating enzymes, form a large class of proteins whose activity is to mediate the disassembly of ubiquitin-protein conjugates. Based on sequence motif similarity, more than 90 deubiquitylating enzymes have been identified in the human genome and were originally classified into two main families: the ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases and ubiquitin-specific proteases (USP) (14Baek K.H. Exp. Mol. Med. 2003; 35: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Proteases belonging to the C-terminal hydrolase family are generally small (20-30 kDa) and are associated with the proteasomes. They are involved in the generation/recycling of ubiquitin monomers from polyubiquitin chains by removing it from proteins degraded in proteasomes (15Hochstrasser M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Members of the USP family, which includes FAM/USP9X, are large (60-300 kDa) and are able to hydrolyze ubiquitin from ubiquitylated substrates prior to proteasomal entry, thus extending the half-life of the protein and therefore modulate their activities in the cell. This type demonstrates tissue specific pattern of expression and has been shown to exhibit substrate specificity. USP9X/FAM is the mammalian counterpart of the product of the Drosophila fat-facets gene (faf) that is essential for normal eye development and viability of the early embryo (16Fischer-Vize J.A. Rubin G.M. Lehmann R. Development (Camb.). 1992; 116: 985-1000Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic experiments have identified the Liquid facets protein (Lqf) as one critical substrate of Faf in the eye (17Cadavid A.L. Ginzel A. Fischer J.A. Development (Camb.). 2000; 127: 1727-1736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, a few substrates have been identified for USP9X/FAM. It binds to and stabilizes β-catenin and AF-6, important components of cell-cell adhesions and members of a transcription factor complex. Another substrate for FAM/USP9X is the vertebrate homologue of Lqf, Epsin1 (17Cadavid A.L. Ginzel A. Fischer J.A. Development (Camb.). 2000; 127: 1727-1736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Chen H. Polo S. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14908-14913Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Epsin 1, a major binding partner for Eps15 (EGFR-phosphorylated protein 15), functions as an important adaptor in clathrin coat assembly and may have additional roles in growth factor receptor signaling and transcription (20De Camilli P. Chen H. Hyman J. Panepucci E. Bateman A. Brunger A.T. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In this report, we characterize the interaction between Itch and FAM/Usp9X. Similar to other HECT domain ubiquitin ligases, Itch activity leads to its auto-catalytic ubiquitylation (21Gao M. Labuda T. Xia Y. Gallagher E. Fang D. Liu Y.C. Karin M. Science. 2004; 306: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 23Verdecia M.A. Joazeiro C.A. Wells N.J. Ferrer J.L. Bowman M.E. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 249-259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). We show that this auto-ubiquitylation activity leads to proteasomal degradation of Itch. Interaction between Itch and FAM reverses Itch auto-ubiquitylation and protects the ligase from proteasomal degradation. Consistent with this observation, experimental manipulation of FAM levels by overexpression or siRNA-induced down-regulation directly impact on endogenous Itch levels. Accordingly, the expression levels of both proteins are correlated in a variety of tissues and cell lines. Together, these results suggest that FAM directly regulates the level of expression of Itch, which suggests that Itch-dependent cellular processes would also be dependent on FAM expression. cDNA Constructs and Mutagenesis—Full-length Itch WT, Itch ΔC2, Itch ΔC2/ΔPRD, Itch C2, Itch PRD, and ligasedead Itch CA constructs were described in Angers et al. (4Angers A. Ramjaun A.R. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11471-11479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Other Itch cDNA constructs were obtained by PCR using Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) and the following primers: Itch HECT, 5′-GAGAATCGATAAGTCGACCCTATGTTCGGGACTTCAAAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAGAGGTACCGCGGCCGCTTACTCTTGTCCAAATCCTTCTG-3′ (reverse); Itch ΔHECT, 5′-GAGAATCGATAAGTCGACCAATGGGTAGCCTCACCATG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAGAGGTACCGCGGCCGCTTACCGAACATAGGCTATCTGAG-3′ (reverse); Itch WW, 5′-GAGAATCGATAAGTCGACTCAATGGTTCACCATCTGCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAGAGGTACCGCGGCCGCTTACCGAACATAGGCTATCTGAG-3′ (reverse); Itch C2/PRD, 5′-GAGAATCGATAAGTCGACCAATGGGTAGCCTCACCATG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAGAGGTACCGCGGCCGCTTAGGCAGATGGTGAACCATTG-3′ (reverse); Itch PRD/WW, 5′-GAGAATCGATAAGTCGACCTGAAGATGCAGGAGCTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAGAGGTACCGCGGCCGCTTACCGAACATAGGCTATCTGAG-3′ (reverse). The resulting PCR products were subcloned into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) to add a GST tag. Itch ΔWW was produced by deleting the 5′ end of Itch full-length in pGEX-4T-1 with EcoRI digestion and subcloning in its place the PCR product obtained from primers forward 5′-GAGAGAATTCTCAATGGGTAGCCTCACCATG-3′, reverse 5′-GAGAGAATTCTAGGGCCTGAGCCTCCAG-3′. His6-Myc-ubiquitin was described previously (24Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). hemagglutinin-ubiquitin expression vector was a kind gift from Ted Dawson (John Hopkins University) and FAM siRNA vectors were a kind gift from René Bernards (Netherlands Cancer Institute) (25Dirac A.M.G.

All GST fusion proteins were expressed in DH5α and BL21 strains of Escherichia coli and purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies—Monoclonal antibodies against the FLAG epitope and β-actin were purchased from Sigma. Monoclonal antibody against Myc and hemagglutinin epitopes were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and US Biologicals, respectively. Polyclonal antibody against GFP was purchased from Molecular Probes and Pan-Endophilin polyclonal antibody was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. Affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies against GST (26McPherson P.S. Czernik A.J. Chilcote T.J. Onofri F. Benfenati F. Greengard P. Schlessinger J. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 2004; 15: 1591-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) were described previously. Immunofluorescence Analysis—COS-7 cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips and transfected using FuGENE reagent (Roche Diagnostics). Approximately 15 h post-transfection, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (20 mm NaH2PO4, 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.4) for 20 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100/phosphate-buffered saline for 4 min and processed with appropriate primary and secondary antibodies. Immunoprecipitation and Pulldown Assays—For cultured cells, 100-mm dishes of transfected HEK-293T cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 1 ml/dish buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, protease inhibitors). The cells were sonicated and Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%. Extracts were incubated for 20 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge. For brain extracts, adult rat brains were homogenized in buffer A and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min. Triton X-100 was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 1%, and the extract was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The sample was then centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 30 min. For immunoprecipitation assays, extracts of transfected cells were precleared with either protein A-Sepharose or protein G-agarose beads. The precleared supernatants were then incubated with the indicated antibodies and protein A-Sepharose or protein G-agarose beads for 4-16 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed extensively with buffer A, 1% Triton X-100 and prepared for Western blot analysis. For pulldown assays, extracts were incubated with 10 μg of the appropriate GST fusion protein for 4-16 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed extensively in the same buffer and prepared for Western blot analysis. In Vitro Ubiquitylation Assays—Recombinant ubiquitin was purchased from Sigma, and ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) and UbcH7 (E2) were purchased from Affinity Bioreagents. Full-length Itch CA proteins were produced as GST fusions and eluted from glutathione beads by thrombin cleavage. Ubiquitylation reactions (25 μl) contained 10 μg of Itch CA, ubiquitin (25 μm), ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 (100 nm), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH7 E2 (0.5 μm), and 10 μg of total proteins extracted from HEK-293T cells, or the same extract immunodepleted for Itch, and ATP (4 mm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The reactions were incubated for 90 min at 25 °C and stopped by addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer and boiling. The reaction mixtures were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and subjected to Western blot. Identification of FAM/USP9X as a Novel Itch-interacting Partner—To detect Itch binding patners, GST and GST-Itch fusion proteins precoupled to glutathione-Sepharose were then incubated with rat brain extract. Affinity-purified complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue G (Fig. 1B). Several protein bands that specifically associated with GST-Itch were identified and cut out of the gel. Each band was individually processed to yield in-gel trypsin digestion products and the resulting peptide products were separated and analyzed in an automated system by nanoscale liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight MS/MS as described in Ref. 28Blondeau F. Ritter B. Allaire P.D. Wasiak S. Girard M. Hussain N.K. Angers A. Legendre-Guillemin V. Roy L. Boismenu D. Kearney R.E. Bell A.W. Bergeron J.J. McPherson P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3833-3838Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar. Spectra were analyzed by MASCOT software to identify tryptic peptide sequences matching to the National Center for Biotechnology Information of non-redundant protein data base with a confidence level of 95% or greater (29Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6661) Google Scholar). Six of the eight bands isolated were heavily contaminated with GST and/or Itch peptides, which prevented the identification of potential Itch interacting partners present within that region of the gel. One of the remaining bands, positioned at ∼40 kDa in the gel, contained 12 peptides assigned to Endophilin. Itch was identified as an Endophilin binding partner in earlier work (4Angers A. Ramjaun A.R. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11471-11479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The other band was positioned well above the 200 kDa marker. MS/MS analysis revealed 28 peptide matches to the ubiquitin specific protease USP9X/FAM (Fig. 1B). The calculated molecular mass of USP9X/FAM is ∼290 kDa. FAM/USP9X Directly Forms Complexes with Itch—FAM/USP9X is a large protein and the conserved enzymatically active site represents only a small fraction of its size. It is thus likely that the protease exhibits a complex structure, possibly with multiple specific binding domains to recognize various substrates (30Wood S.A. Pascoe W.S. Ru K. Yamada T. Hirchenhain J. Kemler R. Mattick J.S. Mech. Dev. 1997; 63: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 31Chen X. Overstreet E. Wood S.A. Fischer J.A. Dev. Genes Evol. 2000; 210: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To verify that FAM/USP9X and Itch form complexes in vivo at physiological concentrations, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments of endogenous proteins in cell lysates from HEK-293T cells. HEK-293T cells were selected because they express detectable levels of both Itch and FAM/USP9X (Fig. 6B). Immunoprecipitation of endogenous Itch coimmunoprecipitated substantial amounts of FAM/USP9X (Fig. 2A). Endophilin was also coimmunoprecipitated. Hence endogenous Itch is capable of interacting with both FAM/USP9X and Endophilin. Since it is known that Endophilin directly interacts with Itch, we next investigated whether coimmunoprecipitation of Itch with Endophilin would also pull down FAM/UXP9X. Indeed, immunoprecipitation of endogenous Endophilin resulted in the coimmunoprecipitation of both FAM/USP9X and Itch (Fig. 2A). Taken together, these results suggest that Itch can interact with both Endophilin and FAM/USP9X, in the same ternary complex in vivo.FIGURE 2Itch forms complexes with FAM/USP9X. A, coimmunoprecipitation (IP) of endogenous Itch (left panel) or Endophilin (right panel) proteins. CL from HEK-293T cells were immunoprecipated with antibodies against either Itch or Endophilin. CL (100 μg) and immunoprecipated complexes were separated on a 3-12% SDS-PAGE. The gel was cut horizontally and Western blotted with the FAM/USP9X antibody (top), the Itch antibody (middle), and the Endophilin antibody (bottom). As a control (C3), protein A-Sepharose beads were incubated with the CL in the absence of either antibody. IB, immunoblotted.B, overlay assay using GST, GST-Itch, or GST-Endophilin were performed on extracts from HEK-293T cells. 100 μg of CL from HEK-293T cells was separated on SDS-PAGE. The membrane corresponding to each lane was cut vertically, incubated with 50 pmol/ml GST, GST-Itch, or GST-Endophilin separately, and Western blotted with antibodies to GST. The first lane shows control blots with the indicated antibodies. C, GFP-Itch was transfected into COS-7 cells, and its localization was compared with that of endogenous FAM/USP9X. The colocalization of Itch (green) with FAM/USP9X (red) is revealed in the blended image (right panel). Open arrows point to the trans-Golgi network region where most colocalization was observed. The closed arrows point to vesicular compartments where both proteins are also present. n = nucleus. Scale bar represents 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next performed overlay experiments to determine whether the interaction between Itch and FAM/USP9X is direct. In these assays, extracts from HEK-293T cells were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and incubated with purified GST, GST-Itch, or GST-Endophilin. Bound proteins were subsequently detected with an anti-GST antibody. Significant binding of Itch to FAM/USP9X was observed. Additionally, Itch bound directly to Endophilin (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, Endophilin did not directly interact with FAM/USP9X under these conditions but with several other proteins migrating around 100 kDa, most likely corresponding to Itch, GLK, and Dynamin, proteins previously demonstrated to interact with Endophilin (Fig. 2B) (4Angers A. Ramjaun A.R. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11471-11479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 32Ramjaun A.R. Angers A. Legendre-Guillemin V. Tong X.K.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8710-8716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). No binding was detected when resolved HEK-293T proteins were incubated with GST alone. Thus, the interaction between Itch and FAM can occur in the absence of an intermediate. However, results from the coimmunoprecipitation and overlay assays indicate that the association between FAM/USP9X and Endophilin can be explained via an indirect interaction, most likely mediated by Itch. These data also imply that FAM/USP9X exhibits specificity in its direct interaction with select substrates. To further confirm the interaction between the proteins, we investigated whether FAM/USP9X and Itch are localized to similar subcellular compartments. The subcellular localization of Itch and FAM/USP9X have been previously explored separately. In COS-7 cells Itch expression was found in the trans-Golgi network and endosomal compartments (4Angers A. Ramjaun A.R. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11471-11479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The perinuclear pool overlapped with markers of the Golgi with no significant overlap with those of the endoplasmic reticulum. Similar to Itch localization, FAM/USP9X staining was associated with the Golgi, multive-sicular bodies, and lysosomes. Little, if any, colocalization was found with markers of the early endosomes or the endoplasmic reticulum (27Murray R.Z. Jolly L.A. Wood S.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1591-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To explore this further, we transiently transfected COS-7 cells with GFP-tagged Itch-full length and performed immunofluorescent detection of endogenous FAM/USP9X using a specific FAM polyclonal antibody (27Murray R.Z. Jolly L.A. Wood S.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1591-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). Similar to previous reports, FAM staining was visualized predominantly in a perinuclear compartment and exhibited punctate staining that extended throughout the cell. Similarly, the expression of Itch was predominantly detected as punctate structures in the cytoplasm and around the nucleus, consistent with our previous observations. The proteins overlap in a perinuclear compartment most likely corresponding to the Golgi apparatus. The extent of colocalization is less apparent in more peripheral vesicular structures, suggesting that only a subset pool of both proteins are colocalized in vivo. FAM/USP9X Interacts with Itch through the WW Domain—HECT domain ubibiquitin ligases of the Nedd4 family generally interact with their substrates through the WW domains, with recognition preference for the motif PPXY(PY) (34Otte L. Wiedemann U. Schlegel B. Pires J.R. Beyermann M. Schmieder P. Krause G. Volkmer-Engert R. Schneider-Mergener J. Oschkinat H. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Additionally, in earlier work we have shown that another domain on Itch, the PRD, is also involved in protein interaction, specifically to Endophilin (4Angers A. Ramjaun A.R. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11471-11479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Hence, we sought to map the specific region on Itch involved in binding to FAM/USP9X. A number of N- and C-terminal truncations were engineered by successively deleting each characterized domain separately or in combination (Fig. 3A). Rat brain extracts were mixed with the constructs expressed as GST fusion proteins precoupled to glutathione-Sepharose. Bound proteins were then resolved on SDS-PAGE and blotted with a polyclonal antibody specific to FAM/USP9X. As a control for Itch interaction, we also blotted for Endophilin. All GST-Itch fusion proteins containing the WW domains were able to pull down FAM/USP9X from the extract. Conversely those lacking the WW domains were unable to bind FAM/USP9X (Fig. 3B). Deletion of the WW domains alone completely abolished the ability of Itch to bind to FAM/USP9X (Fig. 3B). Similar to previous reports, Itch required the PRD domain to recognize Endophilin (Fig. 3B). Additionally, FAM/USP9X did not bind to control GST (Fig. 3B) or GST-Endophilin (data not shown). These results demonstrate that FAM/USP9X is recognized by the WW domains of Itch. FAM/USP9X Can Deubiquitylate Itch—FAM/USP9X is a member of the USP family of deubiquitylating enzymes characterized by a number of conserved regions including the Cys and His boxes in the catalytic core of the enzyme. The protease has been shown to deubiquitylate a number of target proteins such as Epsin and AF-6. On the other hand, Itch itself ubiquitylates various substrates. By virtue of the direct interaction between Itch and FAM/USP9X, we reasoned that each might be a substrate for the other, that is that FAM/USP9X could deubiquitylate Itch, and Itch could ubiquitylate FAM/USP9X. Since Itch can undergo autocatalytic ubiquitylation (see below), HEK-293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing Myc-ubiquitin and FLAG-Itch with or without V5-FAM. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, the cells were lysed, and ubiquitylated proteins were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Myc antibody. Proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blotted with anti-FLAG or anti-V5 antibody to assess the presence of Itch or FAM, respectively, in the ubiquitylated protein pool. When cells were transfected with FLAG-Itch and Myc-ubiquitin, ubiquitylated forms of Itch could be detected by the FLAG antibody in the immunoprecipitated fraction (Fig. 4A, lower panel). In the presence of FAM/USP9X, all ubiquitylated FLAG-Itch was lost. Interestingly, ubiquitylated FAM could not be detected in the cells coexpressing FLAG-Itch and V5-FAM, suggesting that Itch might not ubiquitylate FAM (Fig. 5A, upper panel). FLAG Western blots of cell lysates (CL) revealed equal expression of FLAG-Itch in all conditions. To further explore FAM-induced deubiquitylation of Itch, HEK-293T cells transfected with FLAG-Itch and Myc-ubiquitin and with or without V5-FAM were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody, and immunoprecipated proteins were blotted with monoclonal anti-Myc antibody to detect ubiquitylation. A significant decrease in Itch ubiquitylation was observed upon FAM/USP9X overexpression represented by a reduction in the number of Itch migrating species resulting from ubiquitin modifications of this protein (Fig. 4B). Together these results demonstrate that FAM/USP9X is capable of cleaving ubiquitin chains from the ligase Itch.FIGURE 5Itch is ubiquitylated by itself and degraded in the proteasome. A, HEK-293T cells were transfected with Myc-ubiquitin and FLAG-Itch WT or the ligase dead mutant FLAG-Itch CA. 48 h post-transfection, cell-lysates were obtained and immunoprecipitated (IP) with either anti-FLAG or anti-Myc antibodies as indicated and immunoblotted with either anti-FLAG or anti-Myc antibodies"

The mechanisms responsible for the massive accumulation of GFAP in Alexander disease remain unclear. In this study, we show that overexpression of both wild type and R239C mutant human GFAP led to cytoplasmic inclusions. GFAP accumulation also led to a decrease of proteasome activity and an activation of the MLK2-JNK pathway. In turn, the expression of activated mixed lineage kinases (MLKs) induced JNK activation and increased GFAP accumulation, whereas blocking the JNK pathway decreased GFAP accumulation. Activated MLK also inhibited proteasome function. A direct inhibition of proteasome function pharmacologically further activated JNK. Our data suggest a synergistic interplay between the proteasome and the SAPK/JNK pathway in the context of GFAP accumulation.

The major molecular constituents of RFs are the intermediate filament protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), the small heat shock proteins (shsps), αB-crystallin and hsp 27, as well as ubiquitin (1Johnson A.B. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 2002; 20: 391-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Overexpression of normal human GFAP in the astrocytes of transgenic mice resulted in cytoplasmic inclusions that appeared identical to the RFs in AxD (2Eng L.F. Lee Y.L. Kwan H. Brenner M. Messing A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 53: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 3Messing A. Head M.W. Galles K. Galbreath E.J. Goldman J.E. Brenner M. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 391-398PubMed Google Scholar), raising the possibility that genetic defects in the GFAP gene were a primary cause of AxD. Sequencing analysis revealed that almost all AxD patients are heterozygous for nonconservative mutations in the coding region of GFAP (4Brenner M. Johnson A.B. Boespflug-Tanguy O. Rodriguez D. Goldman J.E. Messing A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), a finding subsequently confirmed by other investigations (reviewed in Refs. 5Li R. Messing A. Goldman J.E. Brenner M. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 2002; 20: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar and 6Li R. Johnson A.B. Salomons G. Goldman J.E. Naidu S. Quinlan R. Cree B. Ruyle S.Z.

Neurol. 2005; 57: 310-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Although mutations in GFAP are regarded as causative for AxD, little is known of the mechanisms by which GFAP accumulates in RFs or the effects of GFAP accumulation on astrocyte function. Earlier work in our laboratory focused on protein inclusions resulting from expression of GFAP in cell lines. Transient transfection of wild type (WT) human GFAP caused filamentous, cytoplasmic inclusions in cultured primary mouse astrocytes, NIH3T3 cells, and rat and human glioma cells (7Koyama Y. Goldman J.E. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 1563-1572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Inclusion formation was further confirmed by Hsiao et al. (8Hsiao V.C. Tian R. Long H. Perng Der M. Brenner M. Quinlan R.A. Goldman J.E. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2057-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), who expressed WT and R239C mutant (mt) human GFAP in Cos7 cells, which contain vimentin (Vim) but not GFAP, and also in SW13 Vim- cells, which contain no endogenous intermediate filaments. Introduction of both WT and mt GFAP led to a variety of GFAP aggregation phenotypes, including a filamentous pattern, a diffuse pattern, irregular coils, and aggregates or large inclusions scattered around the nuclei. Both altered proteasome function and activated stress pathways might be important consequences of GFAP accumulation. First, small hsps are major constituents of RFs, and AxD tissues contain high levels of shsp transcripts (9Head M.W. Corbin E. Goldman J.E. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 1743-1753PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that GFAP accumulation results in the up-regulation of stress pathways. Second, protein aggregation is a signature pathology of a number of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, and polyglutamine disorders, and is accompanied by a decrease in proteasome activity, indicating that the proteasome system might be a critical pathway through which cellular dysfunction occurs (10Kopito R.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 524-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar). Thus, to gain insights into the effects of GFAP accumulation, we investigated the possibility that it leads to a cellular stress response and decreased proteasome function. Since the mutation generating an amino acid change at Arg-239 is the most common in AxD and produces severe disease, we focused on the expression of R239C mt GFAP. When compared with WT, the mutation exacerbated the aggregation of GFAP. GFAP accumulation resulted in an impaired proteasome function and also in the activation of the JNK pathway. In turn, both the proteasome hypofunction and JNK activation increased GFAP accumulation, leading to a positive feedback loop that produced further protein accumulation, and finally, an increased susceptibility of the cell to stressful stimuli. Reagents—Cell culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium), F12, and molecular biological reagents were obtained from Invitrogen and Qiagen. Primary antibodies included anti-GFAP polyclonal antibody (DAKO), anti-GFAP monoclonal antibody, anti-αB-crystallin polyclonal antibody, anti-ubiquitin monoclonal antibody (Chemicon), anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti-p-JNK, total JNK, p-MLK3, and Hsp70 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-GAPDH monoclonal antibody (Encor), and anti-20S polyclonal antibody (Biomol). The fluorescence-conjugated and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Chemicon and Amersham Biosciences. MG132, lactacystin, camptothecin, anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel, and protein G-Sepharose were from Sigma. Brain Tissue—Tissues stored at -80 °C from cerebral hemispheric white matter of control subjects or AxD cases with different mutations were obtained postmortem. For immunohistochemistry, the tissue was fixed in formalin and then embedded in paraffin. All AxD cases were diagnosed based on histopathological examination and confirmed by the molecular genetic analysis for GFAP mutation. Controls included frozen central nervous system tissue from two children, one with no neurological disease (Control I) and one with Werdnig-Hoffman disease (non-AxD, non-leukodystrophy neurological disease without RFs) (Control II). Cell Cultures and Transfection—cDNA clones encoding WT GFAP or R239C mt GFAP were inserted into a pcDNA3-FLAG expression vector for expressing a GFAP-FLAG fusion protein or into the EGFP-C1 expression vector, resulting in a fusion of GFP to the N-terminal of GFAP. pcDNA3-HA-AvMLK2, pcDNA3-HA-AvMLK3, pcDNA3-HA-Av ASK1, and pCMV-d/N-C-Jun were constructed as before (11Xu Z. Maroney A.C. Dobrzanski P. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 4713-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The GFP-U plasmid was a gift from Prof. Ron R. Kopito. Five cell lines were used in this study, including three GFAP-negative cells (Cos7, SW13 Vim-, and 293T) and two GFAP-positive cells, immortalized human astrocytes (IM) and U251 astrocytoma cells. Among them, Cos7 and SW13 Vim- cells were transiently transfected with the GFAP-FLAG plasmid using Lipofectamine Plus. 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested or fixed for either Western blotting or immunostaining. MG132 (10 μm), lactacystin (10 μm), or camptothecin (CPT) (10 μm) were added to cultures at 24 h after transfection and incubated for a further 24 h, with Me2SO as the vehicle control. To generate permanent cell lines, IM and U251 cells were transfected with the GFAP-GFP plasmid using calcium phosphate. The transfected cells were then cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, antibiotics, and 500 μg/ml G418. Clonal lines of stably transfected cells were isolated and confirmed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter sorting or Western blot analysis. The 293T cells stably expressing GFP-U were obtained using the same protocol. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—For protein extraction and fractionation, brain tissue or cells were homogenized in total cell lysis buffer (2% w/v SDS, 6.25% mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA supplemented with the protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science)) for total protein or in a fractional lysis buffer to separate soluble and insoluble fractions. Briefly, cells or brain tissues were homogenized in S1 buffer (0.5% v/v Triton-X, 2 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA, and sucrose implemented with Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). After centrifugation for 20 min at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C, the supernatant was collected as the soluble fraction, and the pellet (insoluble fraction) was recovered in S2 buffer (2% w/v SDS, 2 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA). Protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. For immunoprecipitation, equal amounts of protein from whole cell extracts were diluted in immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (11Xu Z. Maroney A.C. Dobrzanski P. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 4713-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and were incubated with M2-conjugated protein A-Sepharose or with anti-GFAP antibody and protein G-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were then separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blotting as described previously (11Xu Z. Maroney A.C. Dobrzanski P. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 4713-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Analysis of Cell Survival—The cells were plated into 96-well plates, and cell viability was measured by methylthiazoletetrazolium (MTT) assay according to standard protocol. All results were confirmed by the trypan blue test. Data were presented as the percentage of living cells. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Proteasome Activity Assay—Cell debris were homogenized in ice-cold proteolysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.035% SDS, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). The homogenates was incubated with proteasome substrate II (S-II, Z-20LLE22-AMC) or III (S-III, Suc-LLVY-AMC) to detect the post-glutamyl peptidase hydrolase (PGPH) and chymotrypsin-like peptidase activities, respectively. Fluorescence was monitored at 360 nm excitation and 450 nm emission in a fluorescence plate reader (Bio-Tek FL600). Immunostainning and Immunohistochemistry—Immunostaining of cultured cells was performed at 48 h after transfection, as described before (8Hsiao V.C. Tian R. Long H. Perng Der M. Brenner M. Quinlan R.A. Goldman J.E. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2057-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In some experiments, cultures were exposed to a cytoskeleton buffer (PHEM buffer: 100 mm Pipes, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 6.8) to remove soluble proteins prior to immunostaining. Fluorescent labeled cells were visualized using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope. Immunohistochemisty was performed according to general protocols. 10-μm-thick consecutive sections were prepared. Sections were blocked in Tris-buffered saline with Tween/5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h and subsequently incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Negative control sections were held in phosphate-buffered saline during the primary incubation. Sections were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody 1 h at room temperature and developed with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine. Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as mean ±S.D. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Overexpression of WT or AxD Mutant GFAP Leads to Protein Accumulation and Intracellular Inclusions—WT and mt GFAP were overexpressed in four different cell lines, each with different intermediate filament constituents: Cos7 cells (GFAP-, Vim+), SW13 Vim- cells (GFAP-, Vim-), and two GFAP-positive astrocytic cell lines (immortalized human astrocytes (IM) and U251 human astrocytoma cells (U251)). Among them, the Cos7 and SW13 Vim- cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged GFAP. Because of the low transfection efficiency of astrocytes, we established permanent GFAP overexpressers in the IM and U251 cells, using a GFP-GFAP construct that expresses a fusion protein. Intracellular inclusions were found in all lines (Fig. 1A). A statistical analysis of the various organizational patterns observed in Cos7 cells revealed a significant difference between WT and mt GFAPs (Fig. 1B); the WT generally formed filamentous structures, although some cells also contained inclusions, especially the large ones located next to nuclei. The mt GFAP largely formed inclusions or diffuse patterns composed of tiny dot-like aggregates and far fewer filamentous patterns. The mt GFAP formed more inclusions than did the WT in all cell backgrounds. Note that in astrocytic lines (IM and U251), WT GFAP usually formed filamentous bundles and occasionally very few aggregates (Fig. 1A), whereas mt GFAP formed punctate aggregates predominantly. The transfection of both WT and mt GFAP constructs led to GFAP protein accumulation, as assayed by Western blotting. The increases were apparent in both the Triton X-100-soluble and the Triton X-100-insoluble fractions of the transfected cells (Fig. 2, A-D). Note that in the IM or U251 cells stably expressing WT or mt GFAP-GFP, the anti-GFAP antibody recognized both the endogenous WT GFAP (50 kDa) and the exogenous GFAP-GFP fusion protein (∼80 kDa, Fig. 2, C and D). Interestingly, in the two astrocytic lines, transfection of both WT and mt GFAPs caused an accumulation of the endogenous GFAP of the cells (Fig. 1, C and D). This observation is consistent with our model in which the overexpression of GFAP leads to further accumulation of GFAP (see below). We noted a high molecular weight band immunoreactive to GFAP that was more prominent with the mt than the WT protein. The major band migrated with an apparent molecular weight of approximately twice that of GFAP, suggesting a dimerization. We did not observe any more slowly migrating bands. This GFAP band appeared not only in cells transfected with FLAG-tagged (Fig. 2, A and B) or GFP-tagged mt GFAP (Fig. 2, C and D) but also in non-tagged mt GFAP-expressing cells (not shown), indicating that it was not a function of the tag. We also asked whether the endogenous GFAP is recruited to the GFAP inclusions formed by exogenously introduced mt GFAP in the astrocytic cell lines. Because of the lack of antibody that specifically recognizes WT or R239C mt GFAP, we established permanent IM or U251 cells stably expressing GFP-tagged WT GFAP at a low level. Very few GFAP aggregates were seen in those WT GFAP overexpressers. Transient transfection of FLAG-tagged mt GFAP constructs led to formation of GFAP aggregates. By immunostaining, we found both WT GFP-GFAP and exogenous FLAG-tagged mt GFAP in these aggregates. GFAP Accumulation Elicits a shsp Response—Western blot analysis revealed an increased level of αB-crystallin in WT and mt GFAP-expressing Cos7 and SW13 Vim- cells (Fig. 3). The accumulation of αB-crystallin was also seen in U251 or IM stably expressing WT or mt GFAPs (Fig. 3). In contrast, the level of Hsp70, another heat shock protein and also an ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) component, was not increased due to GFAP overexpression (data not shown), consistent with our previous findings for astrocytes (3Messing A. Head M.W. Galles K. Galbreath E.J. Goldman J.E. Brenner M. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 391-398PubMed Google Scholar) and AxD brain tissues (9Head M.W. Corbin E. Goldman J.E. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 1743-1753PubMed Google Scholar). GFAP Accumulation Activates the SAPK/JNK Pathway—Due to the massive amounts of αB-crystallin that accumulate in the brains of children with AxD and the increased levels in cell cultures overexpressing GFAP, we speculated that GFAP accumulation evokes a cellular stress response. Here we addressed whether the JNK pathway is activated in response to the overexpression of GFAP by monitoring the activated form of JNK (phosphorylated JNK (p-JNK)). Transfection with the vector alone did not activate JNK, but overexpression of WT or mt GFAP resulted in significant increases of p-JNK at 24 and 48 h after transfection (Fig. 4A), whereas levels of total JNK did not change during this period. Persistent elevation of p-JNK also existed in IM cells or U251 cells stably expressing WT or mt GFAP (Fig. 4, B and C) when compared with non-transfected or vector-transfected cells. The increase of activated JNK was greater in cells expressing mt than cells expressing WT GFAP. It is also interesting to note that some of the p-JNK co-localized with the GFAP inclusion bodies in each of the transfected cell lines (data for Cos7 and IM cells shown in Fig. 4E). We explored the association between p-JNK and GFAP inclusions by treating Cos7 cells with the PHEM cytoskeleton buffer to remove soluble proteins and then fixed and immunostained for GFAP and p-JNK. A strong association between p-JNK and GFAP inclusions existed in both WT and mt expressers (Fig. 4E). To determine whether there was a correlation between the level of overexpressed GFAP and extent of activation of JNK, four lines of U251 cells stably expressing WT GFAP and four lines expressing mt GFAP, at low, medium, and high levels were studied. JNK activation was evident in cells with medium levels of either WT or mt GFAP and was enhanced in cells expressing high levels of GFAP (Fig. 4C). The JNK activation state was also assessed in brain tissue from AxD and brain tissues without RFs from non-AxD subjects. A monoclonal anti-p-JNK antibody recognized and co-localized with the RFs(Fig. 4F), showing a similar pattern to the anti-GFAP antibody. We also examined p-JNK by Western blotting in AxD white matter containing RFs and found that the p-JNK was elevated in both Triton-soluble and Triton-insoluble fractions (Fig. 4D). Activation of the SAPK/JNK Pathway Further Increases GFAP Accumulation—To understand how JNK was activated by the GFAP accumulation, we examined kinases upstream of JNK. We found an increased level of phospho-MLK3 in both WT and mt GFAP-transfected cells when compared with the vector controls (Fig. 5A). We next asked whether activation of the JNK pathway promoted GFAP accumulation. We studied the effects of activated MLK2, MLK3, and ASK1, three kinases upstream of JNK, on GFAP levels. Cos7 cells were transfected with WT or mt GFAP alone or together with plasmids encoding constitutively activated (Av) forms of MLK2, MLK3, or ASK1. The introduction of activated kinases led to a dramatic increase in GFAP levels (Fig. 5B, left panel). Examination of co-transfected cells by immunofluorescence showed that MLK2, MLK3, or ASK1 increased the numbers of cells with one or more GFAP inclusions (data not shown). We also co-transfected the cells with GFAP constructs along with a dominant negative mutant form of c-Jun, an immediate downstream component of the JNK pathway. Suppression of the JNK pathway by dominant negative c-Jun led to a decrease in both WT and mt GFAP accumulation in the insoluble fraction (Fig. 5B, right panel), indicating that blocking the JNK pathway inhibits GFAP accumulation. GFAP Accumulation Impairs Proteasome Function—We next asked whether proteasome function is impaired by GFAP accumulation. We examined the effects of GFAP overexpression on proteasome function by transfecting WT or mt GFAP plasmids into 293T/GFP-U stable cell lines, a model system for evaluating function of the proteasome pathway. This cell line permanently expresses a reporter peptide consisting of a short degron fused to the C terminus of GFP (12Bence N.F. Sampat R.M. Kopito R.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1833) Google Scholar). Ordinarily, the ubiquitin-GFP hybrid protein has a very rapid turnover. By monitoring the fluorescence in the GFP-U cells transiently expressing WT or mt GFAP, we found that both WT and mt GFAP overexpression increased steady-state GFP-U fluorescence levels (Fig. 6A). We also observed by Western blotting an accumulation of GFP-U protein in cells expressing WT or mt GFAP (Fig. 6B) or, as a positive control, in empty vector-transfected cells treated with MG132 (not shown). We further examined the proteasome activity with a different, independent assay: the levels of chymotrypsin-like peptidase and PGPH activities (Fig. 7C). Both the PGPH and the chymotrypsin-like peptidase activities were reduced in cells overexpressing WT and mt GFAP when compared with control cells transfected with vector alone. The decreased proteasome activity caused by GFAP accumulation was not the result of a reduction in proteasome complexes. 3Tang, G., in preparation. Inhibition of Proteasome and Activation of the JNK Pathway Have Synergistic Effects on GFAP Accumulation—When we treated cells with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, or CPT, a SAPK/JNK activator, we found that both compounds led to increased GFAP accumulation (Fig. 7A), and also an increased level of phospho-JNK (Fig. 7A). We asked whether there existed a synergistic effect of these two pathways on GFAP accumulation. We first addressed the interplay between proteasome inhibition and the activation of the JNK pathway. In non-GFAP-expressing Cos7 cells, which were transfected with vector only, inhibition of the proteasome pathway did activate SAPK/JNK. As shown in Fig. 7A, cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 showed an increased level of p-JNK when compared with non-drug-treated cells. This observation is in accord with a previous report showing that proteasome inhibition may act as a potential upstream regulator of JNK activation (13Meriin A.B. Gabai V.L. Yaglom J. Shifrin V.I. Sherman M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6373-6379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Overexpression of constitutively activated MLK2 or MLK3 in 293T cells stably expressing GFP-U led to the accumulation of the short-lived protein GFP-U, indicating an impaired proteasome function following the activation of the JNK pathway (Fig. 7B). While treating the cells pharmacologically with CPT, we also observed a decreased protease activity in Cos7 cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. 7C, p < 0.05). CPT treatment further exacerbated the effects of GFAP overexpression. Thus, after CPT treatment, WT GFAP expressers had decreased chymotrypsin-like protease activity by an additional 67%, and mt GFAP expressers had decreased this activity by an additional 58%. WT expressers decreased PGPH activity an additional 44%, and mt GFAP expressers had decreased this activity an additional 47% (Fig. 7C, p < 0.05). Thus, the activation of JNK in the context of GFAP overexpression resulted in further proteasome inhibition. We then asked whether inhibiting proteasome activity by GFAP overexpression or by JNK activation by CPT in GFAP-overexpressing cells would lead to the accumulation of ubiquitinated GFAP. Cells were treated with MG132 or CPT, and GFAP was immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates. Proteins were separated by PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose, on which they were blotted first with an anti-ubiquitin antibody and then reprobed with an anti-GFAP antibody. In non-drug-treated cells (control), there was a high molecular weight smear for ubiquitinated species in WT and mt GFAP transfectants (Fig. 7D), not seen in empty vector controls or in control samples precipitated without antibody (not shown). After JNK activation by CPT, the GFAP-overexpressing cells increased the accumulation of ubiquitinated GFAP (Fig. 7D). Used as a positive control, MG132 also increased the accumulation of ubiquitinated GFAP (Fig. 7D). Taken together, these data suggest that proteasome inhibition, which was already produced by GFAP overexpression, can activate the SAPK/JNK pathway and subsequently be further inhibited by JNK activation itself. Further proteasome inhibition will then increase GFAP levels, establishing a positive feed-back loop in which GFAP levels may continue to rise. Overexpression of mt GFAP Leads to Increased Susceptibility to Apoptotic Stimuli Induced by Camptothecin When Compared with WT GFAP—Based on the observation that activation of the JNK pathway can lead to death in some cell types, we assessed proliferation and death of GFAP-overexpressing cells. We transfected Cos7 cells with the PCDNA3 vector or the same vector encoding WT or mt GFAP cDNA. By Hoechst 33342 staining, we found few apparent apoptotic nuclei in cells transfected with vector alone or with either GFAP construct (data not shown). Cell viability was measured in Cos7 cells at 48 h after transfection or in the stably transfected U251 cells, using the MTT assay and trypan blue dye exclusion methods. No significant cell death was observed in either cell type (Fig. 8, A and B). Using two U251 lines expressing high levels of WT or mt GFAP, we asked whether GFAP accumulation might contribute to cell death at higher JNK activation levels. Cells were exposed to three different concentrations of CPT (10, 25, and 40 μm), using the non-transfected U251 cells as control. No significant cell death was detected in cells at low doses of CPT (10 μm). In contrast, in cells treated with a higher level of CPT (25 μm), significant cell death appeared in cells expressing mt GFAP but not in controls or cells expressing WT GFAP (Fig. 8B), suggesting that mt GFAP overexpression conferred an increased vulnerability to apoptotic stress (cells exposed to 40 μm detached from the plate and were difficult to count in the cell viability assay). We then assayed for p-JNK in the CPT-treated cells and found dose-dependent increases of p-JNK (Fig. 8C), indicating that persistent high activation levels of p-JNK are associated with cell death. WT GFAP Is Prone to Aggregate, and the R239C Mutation Exacerbates the GFAP Accumulation and Aggregation—In accordance with our previous observations in transgenic mice and cell cultures (3Messing A. Head M.W. Galles K. Galbreath E.J. Goldman J.E. Brenner M. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 391-398PubMed Google Scholar, 7Koyama Y. Goldman J.E. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 1563-1572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 8Hsiao V.C. Tian R. Long H. Perng Der M. Brenner M. Quinlan R.A. Goldman J.E. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2057-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we found that overexpression of both WT GFAP and the R239C mt GFAP leads to GFAP accumulation and produces cytoplasmic inclusions. Inclusions formed in GFAP-negative cell lines (Cos7 and SW13 Vim-) and in GFAP-positive cell lines (IM and U251 cells). Based on these findings, we postulate that the formation of inclusions is at least in part due to the increased levels of GFAP protein. To determine whether the presence of the FLAG or GFP tags affected the capacities of the tagged GFAPs to form inclusions, we compared the staining profiles of Cos7, SW13 Vim- cells, and astrocytes transfected with the tagged constructs to those seen when they are transfected with the corresponding non-tagged GFAP construct (7Koyama Y. Goldman J.E. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 1563-1572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 8Hsiao V.C. Tian R. Long H. Perng Der M. Brenner M. Quinlan R.A. Goldman J.E. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2057-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Both tagged and non-tagged WT or mt GFAP could form aggregates in vitro, although there might be a possibility that tags increase the tendency of GFAP to form more aggregates and thus increase the pathology. 4Quinlan, R., manuscript in preparation. This might compromise our ability to detect the differences between effects of overexpressing WT and mt GFAP. However, there are relatively many more aggregate-bearing cells after mt GFAP transfection than after WT transfection, despite the presence of tags (as seen in this report and also in Hsiao et al. (8Hsiao V.C. Tian R. Long H. Perng Der M. Brenner M. Quinlan R.A. Goldman J.E. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2057-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), where no tags were used). The tendency for mt GFAP to form more aggregates was much more apparent in stable astrocytic cell lines expressing GFAP. In IM or U251 cells, WT GFAP formed filamentous bundles, whereas mt GFAP formed punctate aggregates predominantly. In response to accumulation of the exogenously introduced mt GFAP, endogenous WT GFAP was up-regulated and was even incorporated into aggregates. Our immunoblot analysis also revealed a high molecular weight band that existed exclusively in the mt GFAP overexpressers, suggesting that the mt GFAP protein has an increased stability to SDS. Together with the fact that the R239C mutant GFAP is more prone to form more aggregates and more resistant to high salt extraction (8Hsiao V.C. Tian R. Long H. Perng Der M. Brenner M. Quinlan R.A. Goldman J.E. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2057-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we speculate that the mutation itself might confer increased stability to protein-protein interactions in the GFAP polymers and thus exacerbate protein aggregation. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found more activation of JNK (Fig. 4, A-C) and a more dramatic decrease in proteasome activity (Fig. 7C) in cells expressing mt when compared with WT. GFAP Accumulation Induces a Stress Response—A number of studies indicate that protein accumulation activates cellular stress pathways (14Merienne K. Helmlinger D. Perkin G.R. Devys D. Trottier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16957-16967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 17Richter-Landsberg C. Bauer N.G. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 2004; 22: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We found that the accumulation of either WT or an AxD mutant GFAP activates MLKs and JNK in cultured cells and that the accumulation of GFAP is associated with activated JNK in the AxD brain. WT GFAP accumulation in cultured cells and the overexpression of WT hGFAP in transgenic mice both produce cytoplasmic protein inclusions and increased shsps, elements of a stress response (18Hagemann T.L. Gaeta S.A. Smith M.A. Johnson D.A. Johnson J.A. Messing A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 2443-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), suggesting that too much GFAP protein per se can elicit a stress response. Consistent with this idea, the levels of activated JNK correlate positively with levels of both WT and mt GFAPs in the astrocytoma cells stably expressing GFAP. GFAP Accumulation Inhibits Proteasome Activity—We have provided several pieces of evidence that GFAP accumulation impairs proteasome activity. First, at least some of the overexpressed GFAP protein was degraded through the UPS in an ubiquitin-dependent manner. Second, overexpressing either WT or R239C GFAP led to impaired proteasome function, assayed either by GFP-U accumulation or by in vitro proteolytic assays. One possible mechanism for this inhibition is that the accumulated GFAP saturates the capacity of free cytosolic ubiquitin or molecular chaperones required for UPS function. Another possible mechanism might involve a direct interaction between proteasome and GFAP filaments that might retain proteasomes in GFAP inclusions.3 Thus, a competition between the excess GFAP and other cellular proteins for proteasome degradation might occur, leading to slowed protein turnover in general. GFAP Accumulation Increases shsp Levels—In the case of AxD and GFAP accumulation, it is primarily the shsps (αB-crystallin and hsp27) that are up-regulated (2Eng L.F. Lee Y.L. Kwan H. Brenner M. Messing A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 53: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 9Head M.W. Corbin E. Goldman J.E. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 1743-1753PubMed Google Scholar, 19Iwaki T. Kume-Iwaki A. Liem R.K. Goldman J.E. Cell. 1989; 57: 71-78Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). These shsps interact with intermediate filaments, possibly serving a debundling or disaggregating purpose (7Koyama Y. Goldman J.E. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 1563-1572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 20Head M.W. Hurwitz L. Kegel K. Goldman J.E. Neuroreport. 2000; 11: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Transcript and protein levels of shsps are markedly elevated in brains of AxD patients. Similarly, we found that overexpression of WT or R239C GFAP increased the levels of αB-crystallin in cultured cells with different intermediate filament constituents. Shsps are important protectors against cell death (21Arrigo A. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 19-26PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, αB-crystallin protects cells from apoptosis induced by a large number of stresses through interacting with the precursors of caspase-3 (22Kamradt M.C. Chen F. Cryns V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16059-16063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 24Mao Y.W. Xiang H. Wang J. Korsmeyer S.J. Reddan J. Li D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43435-43445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) or with Bax and Bcl-Xs to prevent translocation of these proapoptotic regulators into mitochondria, thus inhibiting downstream apoptotic events (25Mao Y.W. Liu J.P. Xiang H. Li D.W. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 512-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In our cell culture system, we did not find evidence of cell death after GFAP transfection, although the activation of MLKs leads to activation of JNK and death in a number of cell types (11Xu Z. Maroney A.C. Dobrzanski P. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 4713-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). However, persistent and high activation by CPT treatment compromised the ability of mt GFAP-expressing cells to withstand stressful stimuli. Further study will be directed to the possible protective roles of αB-crystallin in the context of GFAP accumulation. Synergistic Interactions among GFAP Accumulation, JNK Activation, and Proteasome Inhibition—The formation of GFAP inclusions was further stimulated by activating the JNK stress-signaling cascade. This appears to be similar to the observation that inclusion bodies formed by polyQ-containing peptides or other abnormal proteins (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutants) are increased by MEKK1 activation, a kinase that activates several downstream stress kinases (15Meriin A.B. Mabuchi K. Gabai V.L. Yaglom J.A. Kazantsev A. Sherman M.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 851-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In our study, the expression of activated forms of ASK1 and MLK2 or MLK3, MAP kinases that activate the JNK and p38 MAP kinase signaling (11Xu Z. Maroney A.C. Dobrzanski P. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 4713-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 26Takeda K. Matsuzawa A. Nishitoh H. Ichijo H. Cell Struct. Funct. 2003; 28: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), stimulated GFAP accumulation. In contrast, inhibiting pathways downstream of JNK with a dominant negative c-jun suppressed GFAP accumulation. The reasons for the progressive accumulation of GFAP may be related to a synergistic interplay between the activated SAPK/JNK pathway and the impaired proteasome system. We observed that the inhibition of proteasome activity, with either MG132 or GFAP overexpression, increased p-JNK, suggesting a stimulatory effect of proteasome inhibition on JNK activation, as reported by Meriin et al. (13Meriin A.B. Gabai V.L. Yaglom J. Shifrin V.I. Sherman M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6373-6379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Similarly, proteasome function was impaired by JNK activation, either by CPT treatment or by the introduction of activated MLKs. We suggest a model in which two linked pathways, proteasome-based protein degradation and JNK activation, interact to regulate GFAP accumulation in AxD (Fig. 9). GFAP accumulation, produced by the expression of the mutant and WT proteins in AxD, overexpression of WT or mt GFAP in transgenic mice, or overexpression of GFAPs in transfected cells, is the inciting pathological stimulus. This accumulation has several consequences. First, it results in the activation of the MLKs-JNK pathway, which in turn exacerbates the GFAP accumulation. The accumulation also inhibits proteasome activity. This has further consequences: more protein accumulation and further activation of the JNK pathway. As a feedback response, JNK activation further inhibits proteasome activity, thus aggravating the adverse effects of GFAP accumulation. In this feedback loop, MLKs may act as the cross-talk signal between two pathways since a direct interaction exists between MLKs and proteasome regulatory complexes PA28. 5Xu, Z., unpublished. Thus, GFAP accumulation elicits the activation of MLKs, and the introduction of activated MLKs impairs proteasome activity (in this report). Second, as a positive consequence, the accumulation of GFAP results in αB-crystallin accumulation. This might act to reverse the abnormal GFAP aggregation (7Koyama Y. Goldman J.E. Am. J.

The balance between the positive and negative consequences of GFAP accumulation might define the survival or death of a cell. In astrocytic cell lines, increased vulnerability to stress occurs when JNK is highly activated using CPT as a stress inducer. It is noteworthy that the AxD brain is full of astrocytes that contain RFs. Indeed, the predominant cell type in the demyelinated or non-myelinated white matter is the astrocyte. Although studies of astrocyte death have not been performed on AxD tissues, it is possible that positive pathways, through hsps, for example, may predominate over death pathways to ensure astrocyte survival. We are grateful to Drs. Paul Fisher and Ron Liem for providing immortalized human astrocytes and SW13 Vim- cells, to Dr. Ron Kopito for supplying the GFP-u construct, and to R.

https://openalex.org/W2049556477,"We have demonstrated a defect in expression of chondroitin 4-O-sulfotransferase-1 (C4ST-1) in murine sog9 cells, which are poorly sensitive to infection by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). Sog9 cells were previously isolated as CS-deficient cells from gro2C cells, which were partially resistant to HSV-1 infection and defective in the expression of heparan sulfate (HS) because of a splice site mutation in the EXT1 gene encoding the HS-synthesizing enzyme. Here we detected a small amount of CS chains in sog9 cells with a drastic decrease in 4-O-sulfation compared with the parental gro2C cells. RT-PCR revealed that sog9 cells had a defect in the expression of C4ST-1 in addition to EXT1. Gel filtration analysis showed that the decrease in the amount of CS in sog9 cells was the result of a reduction in the length of CS chains. Transfer of C4ST-1 cDNA into sog9 cells (sog9-C4ST-1) restored 4-O-sulfation and amount of CS, verifying that sog9 cells had a specific defect in C4ST-1. Furthermore, the expression of C4ST-1 rendered sog9 cells significantly more susceptible to HSV-1 infection, suggesting that CS modified by C4ST-1 is sufficient for the binding and infectivity of HSV-1. Analysis of CS chains of gro2C and sog9-C4ST-1 cells revealed a considerable proportion of the E disaccharide unit, consistent with our recent finding that this unit is an essential component of the HSV receptor. These results suggest that C4ST-1 regulates the expression of the E disaccharide unit and the length of CS chains, the features that facilitate infection of cells by HSV-1.

Biol. 2000; 10: 518-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). GAGs are linear, sulfated polysaccharides composed of repeating disaccharide units consisting of alternating uronic acid and N-acetylhexosamine residues, and synthesized as proteoglycans linked to specific Ser residues in the core protein (1Kjellén L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar, 2Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev.

Sulfated GAGs are typically divided into two types, chondroitin sulfate (CS) and heparan sulfate (HS), on the basis of the N-acetylhexosamine in the disaccharide units (1Kjellén L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar, 3Prydz K. Dalen K.T. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 193-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Sugahara K. Kitagawa H. Curr. Opin.

Compelling evidence has shown that GAGs play crucial roles in a number of physiological phenomena such as cell adhesion, morphogenesis, neural network formation, and cell division (5Perrimon N. Bernfield M. Nature. 2000; 404: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 6Sugahara K. Mikami T. Uyama T. Mizuguchi S. Nomura K. Kitagawa H. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Many glycoproteins of HSV-1 decorate the virion envelope, and some play essential roles in viral attachment to and entry into host cells. In particular, gB, gC, and gD utilize cell surface GAGs and some other receptors to effectively bind to and infect host cells (7Shukla D. Liu J. Blaiklock P. Shworak N.W. Bai X. Esko J.D. Cohen G.H.

Investig. 2001; 108: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent experiments using cell lines deficient in expression of GAGs have suggested that gC also binds to CS characterized by the E disaccharide unit, and that the CS-E unit is a potent inhibitor of HSV infectivity and an essential component of the receptor for HSV (10Bergefall K.

Previously, in the course of the screening to isolate cells non-permissive for lytic infection by HSV-1, gro2C cells were isolated from mouse L cell fibroblasts. Gro2C were subsequently shown to be an HS-deficient mutant cell line due to the dysfunction of EXT1, which encodes a glycosyltransferase essential for the synthesis of HS chains (11McCormick C. Leduc Y. Martindale K. Esford L.E. Dyer A.P. Tufaro F. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 15Gruenheid S. Gatzke L. Meadows H. Tufaro F. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 93-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although gro2C cells cannot synthesize HS and survived the lytic infection with HSV-1, some susceptibility of these cells to HSV-1 was detected (15Gruenheid S. Gatzke L. Meadows H. Tufaro F. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 93-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further selection for HSV-1 resistant gro2C cells led to the isolation of sog9 cells, a cell line >99% resistant to HSV-1 infection (16Banfield B.W. Leduc Y. Esford L. Schubert K. Tufaro F. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3290-3298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Tufaro and colleagues reported that sog9 cells could synthesize neither HS nor CS. Although exactly why CS could not be synthesized in sog9 cells remained unclear (16Banfield B.W. Leduc Y. Esford L. Schubert K. Tufaro F. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3290-3298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it was speculated that a gene mutated in these cells is critical for the biosynthesis of CS, and that the product of this gene is a key enzyme or factor regulating the biosynthesis. This prompted us to investigate sog9 cells to better understand the biosynthesis of CS. Here, we report that sog9 cells are defective in the expression of chondroitin 4-O-sulfotransferase-1 (C4ST-1), which transfers a sulfate to the 4-O-position of a GalNAc residue in CS chains (17Hiraoka N. Nakagawa H. Ong E. Akama T.O. Fukuda M.N. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20188-20196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 18Yamauchi S. Mita S. Matsubara T.

The deficiency in the expression of C4ST-1 was found to lead to a drastic decrease in the 4-O-sulfation of a GalNAc residue and notably the E unit, a highly sulfated disaccharide unit consisting of GlcUAβ1-3GalNAc(4S,6S) (19Sugahara K. Yamada S. Trends Glycosci. Glycotech. 2000; 12: 321-349Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar), where 4S and 6S represent 4-O- and 6-O-sulfate. CS containing the E unit was recently reported as one of the cellular receptors for HSV-1 (10Bergefall K. Trybala E. Johansson M. Uyama T. Naito S. Yamada S. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. Bergström T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32193-32199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The introduction of C4ST-1 into sog9 cells increased the length of CS chains and the susceptibility of the cells to HSV-1. These results indicate that C4ST-1 regulates the length, 4-O-sulfation of CS chains and the subsequent formation of the E unit thus facilitating infection of cells by HSV-1.

Tufaro F. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3290-3298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry Using an Anti-CS Monoclonal Antibody—Gro2C and sog9 cells were fixed in cold methanol at -20 °C for 10 min and air-dried. After being blocked with PBS containing 3% BSA for 1 h at room temperature, the cells were incubated with the anti-CS monoclonal antibody 2H6 (diluted 1:100 in 0.1% BSA/PBS) at room temperature for 1 h, washed with 0.1% BSA/PBS three times, and stained with fluorescein-conjugated goat (anti-mouse IgM) antibody (diluted 1:100 in 0.1% BSA/PBS) at room temperature for 1 h. To confirm the specificity of the staining with the antibody, sog9 cells were pretreated with chondroitinase ABC protease-free (2 milli international units) to remove CS and then processed for immunostaining as described above. Fluorescent images were obtained using a laser-scanning confocal microscope, FLUOVIEW (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Derivatization of GAGs from gro2C and sog9 Cells Using a Fluorophore, 2AB—Cells were homogenized in acetone, and air-dried. The dried materials were digested with heat-pretreated (60 °C, 30 min) actinase E in 200 μl of 0.1 m borate-sodium, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm calcium acetate at 60 °C for 24 h. Following incubation, each sample was treated with trichloroacetic acid and the resultant precipitate was removed by centrifugation. The soluble fraction was extracted with ether. The aqueous phase was neutralized with 1.0 m sodium carbonate and adjusted to contain 80% ethanol. The resultant precipitate was dissolved in 50 mm pyridine acetate and subjected to gel filtration on a PD-10 column using 50 mm pyridine acetate as an eluent. The flow through fractions were collected and evaporated dry. The dried sample was dissolved in water. Digestion with chondroitinase ABC (5 milli-international units) was conducted as described previously at 37 °C for 1 h in a total volume of 10 μl (20Sugahara K. Ohkita Y. Shibata Y. Yoshida K. Ikegami A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7204-7212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Reactions were terminated by boiling for 1 min. Each digest was derivatized with 2-AB, then analyzed by HPLC as reported previously (21Kinoshita A. Sugahara K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Metabolic Labeling—Gro2C and sog9 cells were initially starved in a Glc-free medium for 1 h. The cells were then labeled metabolically with d-[3H]Gal (285.2 mCi/mmol) and [3H]GlcNH2 (285.2 mCi/mmol) in a Glc-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 50 nm Glc and 0.5 μm benzyl-α-d-GalNAc at 37 °C for 24 h (22Kuan S.F. Byrd J.C. Basbaum C. Kim Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19271-19277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cell layer was solubilized with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl and 1% Triton X-100 with gentle rocking at 4 °C overnight and centrifuged. The supernatant fluids were treated with 0.5 m LiOH at room temperature overnight to release the O-linked sugar from core proteins, and neutralized with acetic acid. Labeled GAGs were isolated by anion exchange chromatography using DEAE-Sephacel and subjected to gel filtration on a PD-10 column using 50 mm pyridine acetate as an eluent. The flow-through fraction was collected and evaporated dry. The dried samples were dissolved in water. Purified GAGs were digested with either chondroitinase ABC, a mixture of heparitinase and heparinase, or both simultaneously, and subjected to gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column. Establishment of an Expression Vector for C4ST-1 and Preparation of Cells That Stably Overexpress C4ST-1—The cDNA fragment encoding mouse C4ST-1 was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR with total RNA derived from a mouse heart Marathon-Ready cDNA library as a template using a 5′-primer (5′-AGAGCCTCGGTGAAGCTA-3′) containing a SacII site and a 3′-primer (5′-ATAACCCAGTCTCCATAGAATTC-3′) containing a SalI site. PCR was carried out with KOD-Plus-DNA polymerase (TOYOBO, Tokyo) for 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 53 °C for 42 s, and 68 °C for 120 s in 5% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide. The PCR fragments were subcloned into the SacII-SalI site of the pCMV expression vector (Invitrogen, La Jolla, CA). The nucleotide sequence of the amplified cDNA was determined in a 377 DNA sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems). The expression plasmid (6.7 μg) was transfected into sog9 cells on 100-mm plates using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfectants were cultured in the presence of 300 μg/ml of G418. Then, resultant colonies were picked up and propagated for experiments. Viruses—The HSV strains used were HSV-1 KOS 321, a plaque-purified isolate of wild-type strain KOS (23Holland T.C. Marlin S.D. Levine M. Glorioso J. J. Virol. 1983; 45: 672-682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and HSV-1 gC-39, a gC-null derivative of KOS 321 (24Holland T.C. Homma F.L. Marlin S.D. Levine M. Glorioso J. J. Virol. 1984; 52: 566-574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For infectivity assays, stocks of virus were titrated on GMK AH1 cells. For attachment assays, [methyl-3H]thymidine-labeled virions were purified from culture media by centrifugation through a three step discontinuous sucrose gradient as described previously (25Trybala E. Liljeqvist J.A. Svennerholm B. Bergström T. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9106-9114Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Relative amounts of purified virions in the preparations were estimated based on the quantification of VP5 (26WuDunn D. Spear P.G. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 52-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Viral Infectivity and Effects of Enzymatic Degradation of CS— Sog9, sog9-C4ST-1-1, sog9-C4ST-1-5, and sog9-C6ST-1 cells were grown to confluence in 6-well plates. For determination of the effects of an enzymatic treatment, chondroitinase ABC at a concentration of 0.1 unit/ml in PBS-A (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4) supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% BSA, or buffer alone, was added at a volume of 0.6 ml/well, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 40 min then cooled at 4 °C for 20 min. After rinsing with cold PBS-A, the virus was added in 5-fold dilutions to duplicate wells and the infected cells were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. After further rinsing with culture medium, a fresh medium containing 1% methylcellulose was added and the infected cells were incubated at 37 °C for 4-5 days. Cells were stained with crystal violet solution to count the viral plaques. Viral Attachment and Effects of Enzymatic Degradation of CS— Sog9 and sog9-C4ST-1-1 cells were grown to confluence in 24-well plates. Cells were either mock-treated or treated with chondroitinase ABC at a concentration of 0.1 unit/ml, as described above. After rinsing, cells were blocked for 30 min at 4 °C with 1% BSA solution in PBS-A supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 mm MgCl2. [methyl-3H]Thymidine-labeled KOS 321 and gC-39 viruses were prediluted in PBS-A supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2 and 0.1% BSA to contain the same number of relative VP5 units, and 200 μl of the virus suspension (271 and 113 cpm/μl for KOS 321 and gC-39, respectively) were added per well. Plates were incubated with continuous shaking at 4 °C for 1 h, and the cells were washed three times with PBS-A. The cells were lysed with 5% SDS and transferred to scintillation vials for quantification of radioactivity. Sog9 Cells Synthesize CS Chains—Previously, sog9 cells, a murine L cell mutant defective in both HS and CS synthesis, were isolated by selection for cells resistant to lytic HSV-1 infection (16Banfield B.W. Leduc Y. Esford L. Schubert K. Tufaro F. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3290-3298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Investigation revealed that this cell line contains a specific defect in the EXT1 gene, which encodes a glycosyl-transferase related to the formation of the HS backbone (27McCormick C. Duncan G. Goutsos K.T. Tufaro F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 668-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). However, the cause of the CS deficiency in sog9 cells has remained elusive. To confirm that CS cannot be synthesized in sog9 cells, immunocytochemistry with sog9 and parental mutant gro2C cells was performed using an anti-CS monoclonal antibody, 2H6, which mainly recognizes CS-A consisting of 4-O-sulfated disaccharide units (Fig. 1B). Unexpectedly, clear signals were detected in sog9 cells, and the signals were eliminated by chondroitinase ABC digestion (Fig. 1, C and D), suggesting that sog9 cells synthesize CS chains. As the immunohistochemical analysis suggested that sog9 cells may form CS, we next measured the glycosyltransferase activity required for the biosynthesis of CS using a cell lysate as an enzyme source. When GalNAcT-I activity, which initiates the biosynthesis of CS by transferring the first GalNAc residue to the linkage tetrasaccharide, was measured using the authentic synthetic substrate GlcUAβ1-3Galβ1-O-benzyloxycarbonyl, analogous to the linkage tetrasaccharide as an acceptor substrate, significant activity comparable to that of gro2C cells was detected (data not shown). In addition, GalNAcT-II and GlcAT-II activities responsible for the formation of the repeating disaccharide units in CS were similar to levels of activity by gro2C cells (data not shown). Hence, the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the chondroitin backbone appeared to be present in sog9 cells as in gro2C cells. These results indicated that glycosyltransferases participating in the biosynthesis of CS are not affected in sog9 cells. Sog9 Cells Express CS with a Low Degree of 4-O-Sulfation—To examine whether sog9 cells in fact synthesize CS, GAGs isolated from this cell line were chemically analyzed. The acetone powder of sog9 or gro2C cells was digested with actinase E, and the resultant GAG-peptides were purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The purified GAG peptides were subjected to digestion with chondroitinase ABC or a mixture of heparitinase and heparinase. The resultant disaccharides were derivatized with 2-aminobenzaminde (2-AB) followed by anion-exchange HPLC on a PA-03 column. As shown in Fig. 2A, gro2C cells contained CS disaccharides dominated by ΔDi-4S, which occupied 69% of the total. As expected, sog9 cells, which have been regarded as a CS-deficient cell line (16Banfield B.W. Leduc Y. Esford L. Schubert K. Tufaro F. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3290-3298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), also contained a detectable amount of CS, although the total amount of disaccharide units was approximately one-third in that of gro2C cells (Fig. 2B and Table 1). Notably, the proportions of ΔDi-4S and ΔDi-diSE units in sog9 cells were dramatically reduced (Table 1). Whereas the proportion of ΔDi-4S (27%) in sog9 cells was less than half that (69%) in gro2C cells, the proportion of ΔDi-diSE in sog9 cells exhibited a drastic reduction, being about one-tenth (1%) that (10%) in gro2C cells (Table 1). As the 4-O-sulfation of GalNAc residues is catalyzed by the chondroitin/dermatan 4-O-sulfotransferase (C4ST/D4ST) family, one member of this family may be defective in sog9 cells and this sulfotransferase may play a critical role in regulating CS content and the formation of the ΔDi-diSE unit (28Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Disaccharide composition of CS from gro2C, sog9, sog9-C4ST-1-1, sog9-C4ST-1-5, sog9-C4ST-2, sog9-D4ST-1, and sog9-C6ST-1 cells Values represent the averages of three independent experiments.Compositiongro2C cellssog9 cellssog9-C4ST-1-1 cellssog9-C4ST-1-5 cellssog9-C4ST-2 cellssog9-D4ST-1 cellssog9-C6ST-1 cellspmol/mg (mol%)ΔDi-0S51.2 (15)70.3 (61)49.8 (16)78.0 (48)74.9 (68)53.1 (64)13.2 (12)ΔDi-6S21.9 (6)13.2 (11)11.8 (4)13.6 (8)7.1 (6)6.9 (8)80.6 (74)ΔDi-4S234.8 (69)31.5 (27)222.9 (72)65.7 (40)28.8 (26)23.2 (28)13.0 (12)ΔDi-diSDNDaND, not detectedNDNDNDNDND1.1 (1)ΔDi-diSE32.7 (10)0.8 (1)25.9 (8)6.3 (4)NDND0.9 (1)Total (pmol/mg)340.6115.8310.4163.6110.883.2108.8Molar ratio of sulfate to disaccharide0.950.400.920.560.320.360.90a ND, not detected Open table in a new tab Sog9 Cells Are Defective in the Expression of C4ST-1—To date, four sulfotransferases, C4ST-1, C4ST-2, C4ST-3, and D4ST-1, which are involved in the 4-O-sulfation of GalNAc residues in CS/DS, have been identified. As C4ST-1, C4ST-2, and D4ST-1 are the major contributors to the 4-O-sulfation of CS/DS in terms of level of enzymatic activity and tissue distribution (28Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), the expression of the mRNA for these genes was evaluated by RT-PCR using cDNA libraries prepared from gro2C and sog9 cells. It was revealed that C4ST-1 mRNA was not expressed in sog9 cells, whereas the levels of C4ST-2 and D4ST-1 mRNA in sog9 cells were indistinguishable from those in gro2C cells (Fig. 3). These results indicated that the C4ST-1 locus might be mutated in sog9 cells, and the residual 4-O-sulfated GalNAc in sog9 cells is most likely formed by the actions of C4ST-2 and/or D4ST-1. Rescue of sog9 Cells by Introducing C4ST-1—To verify that C4ST-1 can restore levels of CS and the E disaccharide unit, a pCMV-Script expression vector, which possesses the cytomegalovirus promoter and the neomycin-resistance gene, and harbors the open reading frame of mouse C4ST-1, was transfected into sog9 cells, followed by positive selection in the presence of a neomycin analog, G418. Each of the resultant colonies was picked up and propagated for experiments. As shown in Fig. 2, C and D, the disaccharide composition and the amount of CS isolated from the two stable clones with the different expression levels of C4ST-1 introduced (sog9-C4ST-1-1 (high expression) and sog9-C4ST-1-5 (low expression) cells) were analyzed by HPLC as above. The results showed that the disaccharide composition and the amount of CS in sog9-C4ST-1-1 cells were similar to those in gro2C cells, verifying that sog9 cells are deficient in C4ST-1 expression. In addition, differences in disaccharide composition and amount of CS were observed between the two stable clones, corresponding to the difference in the expression level of the mouse C4ST-1 introduced (Table 1). Notably, the proportion of ΔDi-diSE unit in sog9-C4ST-1-1 cells was closer to that in gro2C cells, suggesting that C4ST-1 is critical to the formation of this unit. In addition, the increase in the percentage of the disaccharide units ΔDi-4S and ΔDi-diSE, which contain 4-O-sulfate, among all disaccharide units was concomitant with the increase in the total amount of CS (Table 1). These results suggest that 4-O-sulfation of CS formed by C4ST-1 or the expression of C4ST-1 protein itself may be one of the determinants of the total amount of CS. To examine whether the regulation of the amount of CS is specific to C4ST-1, C4ST-2, D4ST-1, or chondroitin 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 (C6ST-1) required for sulfation of the 6-O-position of GalNAc in CS (28Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 30Tsutsumi K. Shimakawa H. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), was introduced into sog9 cells and the CS extracted from these cells was analyzed. Although higher expression of C4ST-2 and D4ST-1 mRNA was observed in sog9-C4ST-2 and sog9-D4ST-1 cells, respectively, than sog9 cells (data not shown), the disaccharide composition and the amount of CS in sog9-C4ST-2 and sog9-D4ST-1 cells were similar to those in sog9 cells (Table 1). In addition, HPLC analysis for sog9-C6ST-1 cells showed no increase in the amount of CS despite a drastic increase in the proportion of ΔDi-6S (Table 1). These results indicate that the amount of CS is specifically regulated by C4ST-1. Deficiency of C4ST-1 Expression Leads to a Reduced Chain Length of CS—To evaluate whether the decrease in the amount of CS in sog9 cells was caused by a reduction in the length or number of CS chains, the length of CS chains obtained from gro2C and sog9 cells was compared. GAGs of each cell line were radiolabeled with [3H]GlcNH2 and [3H]Gal in the presence of benzyl-α-d-GalNAc, which is an inhibitor for the synthesis of mucin-type O-glycans (22Kuan S.F. Byrd J.C. Basbaum C. Kim Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19271-19277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and isolated after mild alkaline treatment using LiOH, which releases O-linked polysaccharides including GAGs from core proteins through β-elimination. The released GAGs were purified using DEAE-Sephacel and treated with heparitinase and heparinase for the analysis of CS chains. Gel filtration analysis using a Superdex 200 column revealed the CS chains of gro2C cells to be much longer than those of sog9 cells, suggesting that the decrease in the amount of CS in sog9 cells was caused by the decrease in the length of CS chains (Fig. 4). Whereas the CS chains of sog9 cells were shorter than those of gro2C cells, the elution profile of the CS chains from sog9-C4ST-1-1 cells was closer to that of the CS chains from gro2C cells (Fig. 4), confirming that the increase in the amount of CS in sog9-C4ST-1-1 was mainly caused by the increase in the length of CS chains. Because of the higher expression of C4ST-1 in gro2C cells than in sog9-C4ST-1-1 cells (data not shown), the recovery of the amount and the chain length of CS in sog9-C4ST-1-1 cells were not completely rescued, compared with gro2C cells. The elution profile of sog9-C4ST-1-5, which showed a moderate increase in 4-O-sulfation (Table 1), was between that of sog9-C4ST-1-1 and sog9 cells (Fig. 4). These results indicated that the expression of C4ST-1 increased the amount as well as the length of CS chains. Infectivity and Attachment of HSV to sog9 Cells before and after Introduction of C4ST-1—Because earlier studies (16Banfield B.W. Leduc Y. Esford L. Schubert K. Tufaro F. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3290-3298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Mårdberg K. Trybala E. Tufaro F. Bergström T. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) had indicated that CS may function as an initial receptor for HSV-1, we investigated whether transfection of sog9 cells with C4ST-1 cDNA can rescue their susceptibility to HSV-1 infection. Compared with sog9 cells, a 7- or 5-fold increase in the number of plaques of an HSV-1 wild-type strain, KOS 321, was observed on the sog9-C4ST-1-1 or sog9-C4ST-1-5 cells, respectively (Fig. 5), suggesting that the expre"

Indeed, we show that a member of this family encoded by a previously uncharacterized open-reading frame in the Schizosaccharomyces pombe genome is required for NHEJ in this organism. Furthermore, our data reveal that XLF family proteins can bind to DNA and directly interact with the ligase IV-XRCC4 complex to promote DSB ligation.

Biochem. 2004; 73: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) is the predominant pathway for DSB repair, particularly in the G0 and G1 phases of the cell cycle, and is mediated by the Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer, the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), XRCC4 and DNA ligase IV (3Hefferin M.L.

Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 1193-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It is believed that during NHEJ, newly created DSB ends are bound by the Ku heterodimer (5Blier P.R. Griffith A.J. Craft J.

The Ku-DNA-PKcs complex is thought to stabilize the DNA ends and prevent extensive end resection (10Lee S.E. Moore J.K. Holmes A. Umezu K. Kolodner R.D. Haber J.E. Cell. 1998; 94: 399-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar), and most likely also plays an important role in aligning the DNA termini (11Rivera-Calzada A. Maman J.P.

The DNA-PKcs-Ku complex then promotes the recruitment of a preformed complex between XRCC4 and DNA ligase IV (ligase IV), which mediates the final ligation steps of the NHEJ process (8Kysela B.

It has been well established that XRCC4 forms homodimers, as well as higher order multimers (16Junop M.S. Modesti M. Guarné A. Ghirlando R. Gellert M. Yang W.

Significantly, XRCC4 not only promotes ligase IV activity but is also required for ligase protein stability (20Bryans M. Valenzano M.C. Stamato T.D. Mutat. Res.

NHEJ proteins are also involved in V(D)J recombination, the site-specific recombination process that generates antibody and T-cell receptor diversity in mammals (28Gellert M. Annu. Rev.

Recently, a previously uncharacterized mammalian protein, XRCC4-like factor (XLF; also called Cernunnos), was identified as an XRCC4 interactor and was shown to bind to the LX complex (31Ahnesorg P.

Strikingly, structural predictions indicated that XLF likely adopts a structure reminiscent of XRCC4 (31Ahnesorg P. Smith P. Jackson S.P.

Although the above reports have identified XLF as a core NHEJ factor required for efficient DSB repair in mammalian cells and have established that XLF can interact with the LX complex, the mechanism(s) by which XLF promotes NHEJ has thus far not been addressed. Here, we show that XLF homologues exist in a wide range of eukaryotes, and demonstrate that the XLF counterpart of the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe plays a crucial role in NHEJ. Furthermore, we reveal that, like XRCC4 itself, S. pombe XLF and human XLF are able to multimerize in solution and can bind to DNA. Finally, we establish that XLF functions by directly stimulating the DNA ligation function of the LX complex. Construction of S. pombe Mutants—Media and standard genetic techniques were as described previously (35Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3137) Google Scholar). To construct an S. pombe strain xlf1Δ, the ORF SPCC24B10.14c was replaced by the nourseothricin-resistance cassette through genomic integration of a PCR fragment as previously described (36Hentges P. Van Driessche B. Tafforeau L. Vandenhaute J. Carr A.M. Yeast. 2005; 22: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The strain xlf1Δ lig4Δ was constructed by crossing xlf1::natMX ura4.D18 leu1.32 ade6.704 with lig4::kanMX ura4.D18 leu1.32 ade6.704 (37Manolis K.G. Nimmo E.R. Hartsuiker E. Carr A.M. Jeggo P.A. Allshire R.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 210-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Cloning, Expression, and Purification of S. pombe Xlf1—S. pombe xlf1 (SPCC24B10.14c) was PCR amplified from cDNA, and cloned into pET28a using BamHI and XhoI. Sequencing confirmed that the single intron predicted for xlf1 in the S. pombe genome annotation was absent in the clone. His6-Xlf1 was expressed and purified from Escherichia coli B834 (DE3) pLysS cells. Briefly, B834(DE3) cells transformed with xlf1-pET28a were grown at 37 °C to A600 of ∼0.6 OD followed by induction for 4 h at 30°C using 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested and stored at –80 °C. Frozen cell pellets were resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 17 μg/ml of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 34 μg/ml of benzamidine) and cells broken by lysozyme digestion and sonication. Following centrifugation, the cell supernatant was loaded onto an NTA (Qiagen) column pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The sample was washed with 20% buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 300 mm imidazole, 10% (v/v) glycerol) to remove contaminants and then eluted with 300 mm imidazole (100% buffer B). Chromatographic fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and those containing Xlf1 were concentrated and loaded onto a Superdex S-200 analytical gel-filtration column equilibrated in buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm DTT). After passage through the size-exclusion column Xlf1 eluted as a highly purified fraction. Expression and Purification of Human XLF—BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with a pGEX plasmid containing GST-tagged human XLF (31Ahnesorg P. Smith P. Jackson S.P. Cell. 2006; 124: 301-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar) and grown overnight at 37 °C in LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. After 16 h, 5 ml of this culture was used to inoculate 2 liters of LB and grown at 37 °C. When the culture reached an optical density of 1.2, it was rapidly cooled. To induce protein expression, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm and grown at 19 °C overnight for 18 h. The cells were harvested and resuspended in Buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm EDTA, 400 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 17 μg/ml of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 34 μg/ml of benzamidine). Cells were broken by sonication, and cleared by centrifugation. The supernatant was loaded onto a GSTrap™ HP Column (GE Healthcare). After washing, the GST tagged protein eluted with Buffer A plus 40 mm reduced l-glutathione (Sigma). Chromatographic fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Fractions containing XLF were concentrated and loaded onto a Superdex S-200 analytical gel-filtration column equilibrated in buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm DTT). After passage through the size-exclusion column Xlf1 eluted as a highly purified fraction. The GST tag was removed by thrombin cleavage. In Vivo DSB Plasmid Repair Assay—The plasmid DSB assay was carried out as described previously (37Manolis K.G. Nimmo E.R. Hartsuiker E. Carr A.M. Jeggo P.A. Allshire R.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 210-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Briefly, plasmids pAL19, PS and PI were digested with PvuII, PstI, or EcoRI, to make blunt-ended, 3′-overhang or 5′-overhang fragments, respectively. The linearized plasmid DNA was separated from uncut DNA by purification from agarose gels. pAL19 was used as the undigested control. 1 μg of either linearized or uncut control plasmid DNA were transformed into log-phase cells using the lithium acetate method. NHEJ frequency was calculated as the percentage of leu+ colonies arising from cells transformed with linear over those transformed with undigested DNA. Three experiments were performed for each strain. In Vitro PCR-based End-joining Assays—pUC18 was cut with PvuI (which cuts twice in the plasmid) to give two-base 5′-overhangs, producing a linearized DNA duplex ∼900 bp smaller than the uncut plasmid. Reaction mixtures contained 66 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP, 120 ng PvuI-cut pUC18, and various amounts of DNA ligase IV-XRCC4 complex (LX) and XLF as indicated in the figure legend. Initially, LX was titrated into this reaction without XLF to find a concentration at which it does not efficiently religate PvuI-cut pUC18. Reactions were incubated for 1 h at 37°C, then were analyzed by PCR, using forward and reverse primers upstream and downstream respectively of the PvuI-restriction sites such that a 1.4-kbp product would be generated by uncut plasmid and one of ∼500 bp if the cut plasmid was successfully religated. The PCR products were then separated and examined on a 1% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Spore Survival Assay—To prepare spores, strains of opposite mating type of the same mutants were mixed on ELN plates and incubated at 30 °C. The mixture of vegetative and postmeiotic cells that grew after 2 days were scraped off the plates, resuspended in sterile water, and treated with Helix pomatia snail gut enzyme for 2 days to kill remaining vegetative cells. The spore preparation was then washed once with sterile water and resuspended in water. The spore concentration was determined using a heamocytometer. Spores were either γ-irradiated or mock-irradiated, plated on rich media and incubated at 30 °C. After 4 days, the number of colonies that had formed were counted. Survival was determined as the percentage of colonies derived from irradiated spores in comparison to colonies from the mock-irradiated spores. Agarose Gel Mobility Shift Assays—Double-stranded DNA (pUC18 or 1kb PCR-amplified DNA) was incubated with XLF at room temperature in EMSA buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm DTT, 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5% glycerol), followed by electrophoresis of the samples in a 1% agarose-TBE gel at 100 V for 1 h. Gels were then stained with ethidium bromide and visualized with UV light. DNA Ligation Assays—Indicated amounts of proteins were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in a 20-μl reaction mixture (66 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP, pH 7.5) with 10 ng of the AflIII-PstI fragment of pBLUESCRIPT as a substrate ([γ-32P]ATP labeled on the 5′-end). Reactions with XLF were pre-incubated for 10 min on ice with indicated amounts of XLF, and ligation was started by adding the LX complex or T4 DNA ligase and transfer to 37 °C. After incubation, the reactions were deproteinized by treating with 0.6% SDS and 0.6 mg/ml proteinase K (Sigma) for 10 min at 37 °C, phenol/chloroform extracted and precipitated with Pellet-Paint co-precipitant (Novagen). Aliquots were then run on 0.8% agarose gels, dried, analyzed using a STORM phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics). Reaction efficiencies were quantified using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics) and expressed as the percentage of the radioactively labeled reaction substrate converted into higher order concatemers. Identification of XLF Homologues in a Wide Range of Eukaryotes—The recent discovery of human XLF/Cernunnos prompted us to search for homologous proteins in other organisms for which extensive genome sequence information exists. By using Psi-Blast searches (38Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59732) Google Scholar), we readily identified XLF homologues in vertebrates and insects, as well as in filamentous fungi such as Neurospora crassa and Aspergillus fumigatus. Lower scoring, but significant, hits were found in the genomes of the fission yeast S. pombe (E = 4e-31, searched with human XLF amino acids (aa) 1–200) and the budding yeasts Yarrowia lipolytica (4e-32) and Debaryomyces hansenii (6e-6). However, these proteins differed considerably in size, ranging from S. pombe XLF (202 aa), metazoan XLFs (∼300 aa) and D. hansenii (335 aa), up to 540–630 aa residues for the predicted XLF homologues in filamentous fungi. To further explore the nature of these XLF-related proteins, we submitted the sequence of human XLF and the sequences of XLF homologues from S. pombe and N. crassa to the online sequence-structure threading program PHYRE (39Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 499-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). For each of these proteins, the N-terminal portion was predicted to be most compatible with the XRCC4 fold among a library of solved structures (supplemental Fig. S1). Only the N-terminal 150–220 residues were modeled into the XRCC4 fold, encompassing the globular domain and the beginning of the C-terminal α-helical stalk, which is also the portion where most sequence similarity between XLF homologues resides. In N. crassa, the region further C-terminal is predicted to be largely disordered by several methods used in PHYRE; the C terminus of human XRCC4 (204–265 aa) has been found to be disordered in the crystal structure (16Junop M.S. Modesti M. Guarné A. Ghirlando R. Gellert M. Yang W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5962-5970Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). These data suggest that, despite the considerable differences in size, the N-terminal portions of all these proteins are likely to adopt an XRCC4-like globular-stalk fold, as has previously been predicted for human XLF (31Ahnesorg P. Smith P. Jackson S.P. Cell. 2006; 124: 301-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). We have therefore termed this group of predicted eukaryotic proteins the XLF family. Although Psi-Blast searches with human XLF did not identify an XLF homologue in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae, when the search was initiated with the D. hansenii sequence, a possible XLF homologue was identified in the genome of the ascomycete Candida albicans, and, strikingly, subsequent analyses revealed that this corresponds to the counterpart of the S. cerevisiae NHEJ gene, NEJ1. Nej1p has been shown to serve as a transcriptionally controlled mating-type regulator of NHEJ in S. cerevisiae, and to function epistatically with Lif1p (S. cerevisiae XRCC4 homologue) and Dnl4p (S. cerevisiae ligase IV homologue) (40Frank-Vaillant M. Marcand S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3005-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 43Valencia M. Bentele M. Vaze M.B. Herrmann G. Kraus E. Lee S.E. Schar P. Haber J.E. Nature. 2001; 414: 666-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Searches with the putative C. albicans XLF homologue also identified proteins in various other budding yeast species; and although these proteins displayed considerable sequence divergence from one another, they were more closely related to S. cerevisiae Nej1p than to any other protein in this organism. Taken together, the above data reveal that XLF-like proteins exist in a wide range of eukaryotic species, and furthermore suggest that S. cerevisiae Nej1p might correspond to the XLF counterpart in this organism, as has recently been suggested by Callebaut et al. (33Callebaut I. Malivert L. Fischer A. Mornon J.P. Revy P. de Villartay J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13857-13860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To further characterize the sequences identified in the above Psi-Blast searches, we divided them into three groups: metazoan homologues of human XLF; yeast sequence homologues of human XLF; and yeast proteins related to Nej1p. We then carried out multiple sequence alignments within each group by using the N-terminal portions (∼200 residues) of the proteins, and then performed secondary structure predictions for each group. Significantly, the three secondary structure predictions were found to be largely compatible between the three alignments (supplemental Fig. S2). These alignments were then all combined into a single alignment (supplemental Fig. S3), and a phylogenetic tree was calculated (Fig. 1A). In the final alignment, the XLF/Nej1p family is shown to be highly divergent, with only a small number of conserved sequence motifs between Nej1p and XLF. Interestingly, the structure of the phylogenetic tree relates to the order in which Psi-Blast searches identified homologues of human XLF; the phylogenetic tree illustrates that the D. hansenii and C. albicans sequences provide a link between human XLF and S. cerevisiae Nej1p, previously not suspected of sharing an evolutionary relationship. Notably, however, we have so far been unable to find XLF/Nej1p homologues in plants or in prokaryotes. Given the high degree of sequence divergence within the XLF/Nej1p family and the predicted similarity to the XRCC4 family, we considered it essential to verify the relationships between members by using methods that did not rely solely on primary structure. Thus, we made four alignments of sequences belonging to either Nej1p, XLF, Lif1p or XRCC4 using the program Muscle (44Edgar R.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1792-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (30184) Google Scholar) and submitted these alignments separately to the sequence structure threading program Fugue (45Shi J. Blundell T.L. Mizuguchi K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 243-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). In each case, the best hits predicted a fold similar to human XRCC4. Because the sequences submitted were aligned to the structure of human XRCC4, this allowed us to make an alignment of the XLF/Nej1p and XRCC4/Lif1p families (supplemental Fig. S4). To further explore the possibility that S. cerevisiae Nej1p is homologous to human XLF, we examined the syntenic relationship between the S. cerevisiae chromosomal interval bearing NEJ1 and related yeast genomes (Fig. 1B). Examination of the conservation of gene order and orientation in chromosomal regions of different ascomycete genomes allows inferences to be drawn as to the evolutionary origin of genes within such syntenic regions, even when the genes themselves are poorly conserved at the sequence level. Comparative genomic studies of syntenic regions have revealed that a whole genome duplication (WGD) occurred in a common ancestor of S. cerevisiae and C. glabrata (these are therefore named post-duplication yeasts) (Fig. 1C and Refs. 46Dujon B. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2005; 15: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar and 47Fischer G. Rocha E.P. Brunet F. Vergassola M. Dujon B. PLoS Genet. 2006; 2: e32Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, the WGD occurred after divergence of the lineages leading to two other ascomycetes closely related to S. cerevisiae, A. gossypii, and K. lactis (hence named pre-duplication yeasts). Thus, a single chromosomal region in preduplication A. gossypii and K. lactis is generally represented by two syntenic regions in postduplication S. cerevisiae and C. glabrata, containing either two diverging homologues or a single homologue if the duplicated copy has disappeared through gene loss. In addition, chromosomal regions syntenic to the S. cerevisiae genome can sometimes be discerned in the genomes of D. hansenii and Y. lipolytica, which are much more distantly related to S. cerevisiae (Fig. 1C). Syntenic relationships are generally much less well conserved in C. albicans because of extensive shuffling of chromosomal regions that has taken place since the lineages diverged (48Chibana H. Oka N. Nakayama H. Aoyama T. Magee B.B. Magee P.T. Mikami Y. Genetics. 2005; 170: 1525-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The ORFs identified as NEJ1 homologues in Psi-Blast searches in the pre-duplication ascomycetes A. gossypii and K. lactis are located in a chromosomal region whose synteny is well conserved in S. cerevisiae and C. glabrata (Fig. 1B). In these four organisms, all of the previously identified NEJ1 homologues are clearly also syntenic homologues, with only a single copy"
https://openalex.org/W2011821683,"Organic anion transporters (OATs) play a critical role in the handling of endogenous and exogenous organic anions by excretory and barrier tissues. Little is known about the OAT three-dimensional structure or substrate/protein interactions involved in transport. In this investigation, a theoretical three-dimensional model was generated for human OAT1 (hOAT1) based on fold recognition to the crystal structure of the glycerol 3-phosphate transporter (GlpT) from Escherichia coli. GlpT and hOAT1 share several sequence motifs as major facilitator superfamily members. The structural hOAT1 model shows that helices 5, 7, 8, 10, and 11 surround an electronegative putative active site (∼830A3). The site opens to the cytoplasm and is surrounded by three residues not previously examined for function (Tyr230 (domain 5) and Lys431 and Phe438 (domain 10)). Effects of these residues on p-aminohippurate (PAH) and cidofovir transport were assessed by point mutations in a Xenopus oocyte expression system. Membrane protein expression was severely limited for the Y230A mutant. For the K431A and F438A mutants, [3H]PAH uptake was less than 30% of wild-type hOAT1 uptake after protein expression correction. Reduced Vmax values for the F438A mutant confirmed lower protein expression. In addition, the F438A mutant exhibited an increased affinity for cidofovir but was not significantly different for PAH. Differences in handling of PAH and cidofovir were also observed for the Y230F mutant. Little uptake was determined for cidofovir, whereas PAH uptake was similar to wild-type hOAT1. Therefore, the hOAT1 structural model has identified two new residues, Tyr230 and Phe438, which are important for substrate/protein interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2036820171,"The studies on the intrinsic structural determinants for export trafficking of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been mainly focused on the C termini of the receptors. In this report we determined the role of the extracellular N termini of α2-adrenergic receptors (α2-ARs) in the anterograde transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through the Golgi to the cell surface. The N-terminal-truncated α2B-AR mutant is completely unable to target to the cell surface. A single Met-6 residue is essential for the export of α2B-AR from the ER, likely through modulating correct α2B-AR folding in the ER.

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 2The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; AR, adrenergic receptor; AT1R, angiotensin II type 1 receptor; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TGN, trans-Golgi network; GFP, green fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; ERK1/2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2; WT, wild type; BFA, brefeldin A; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HA, hemagglutinin. constitute a superfamily of membrane proteins that respond to a vast array of sensory and chemical stimuli and regulate downstream effectors such as adenylyl cyclases, phospholipases, protein kinases, and ion channels through coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins (1Premont R.T. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 2Wess J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 80: 231-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). GPCRs are synthesized in the ER. After being correctly folded in the ER, newly synthesized receptors are packaged into the ER-derived COPII transport vesicles and move to the ER-Golgi intermediate complex and the Golgi apparatus through which they are post-translationally modified. The receptors then move from the Golgi to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to attain fully matured statuses (3Duvernay M.T. Filipeanu C.M. Wu G. Cell. Signal. 2005; 17: 1457-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and are further targeted to their functional destination at the plasma membrane. GPCRs at the plasma membrane may undergo internalization upon stimulation with their agonists. The internalized receptors in the endosome may be sorted to target to the lysosome for degradation or to recycle back to the plasma membrane. Therefore, expression of an individual GPCR at the plasma membrane is determined by the overall balance of export from the ER to the cell surface, internalization, recycling, and degradation. However, compared with the extensive studies performed on the events of the endocytotic pathway (4von Zastrow M. Life Sci. 2003; 74: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 6Tan C.M. Brady A.E. Nickols H.H. Wang Q. Limbird L.E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2004; 44: 559-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), molecular mechanisms governing the export trafficking of GPCRs from the ER through the Golgi to the cell surface and their role in regulating receptor expression at the cell surface and function is relatively less well understood (3Duvernay M.T. Filipeanu C.M. Wu G. Cell. Signal. 2005; 17: 1457-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The progress achieved over the past few years indicates that export from the ER, the first step in intracellular trafficking of GPCRs, is a highly regulated process and influences the cell-surface expression level of GPCRs (3Duvernay M.T. Filipeanu C.M. Wu G. Cell. Signal. 2005; 17: 1457-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 7Petaja-Repo U.E. Hogue M. Laperriere A. Walker P. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13727-13736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). GPCR export from the ER is modulated by direct interactions with multiple regulatory proteins such as the ER chaperones and receptor activity modifying proteins (8Tai A.W. Chuang J.Z. Bode C. Wolfrum U. Sung C.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 877-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 9McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G. Foord S.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1856) Google Scholar). GPCR dimerization also plays an important role in receptor folding and export from the ER. Several studies have indicated that some GPCR dimers are constitutively formed in the ER and that dimerization is required for their transport from the ER to the cell surface (10Jones K.A. Borowsky B. Tamm J.A. Craig D.A. Durkin M.M. Dai M. Yao W.J. Johnson M. Gunwaldsen C. Huang L.Y. Tang C. Shen Q. Salon J.A. Morse K. Laz T. Smith K.E. Nagarathnam D. Noble S.A. Branchek T.A.

Chem. 2003; 278: 49369-49377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the identification of conserved sequences in the membrane-proximal C termini essential for ER export indicates that GPCR export from the ER may be directed by specific motifs (14Duvernay M.T. Zhou F. Wu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30741-30750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 17Robert J. Clauser E. Petit P.X. Ventura M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2300-2308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Protein transport from the Golgi may be mediated through constitutive or regulatory pathways (18Traub L.M. Kornfeld S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Recently, several studies have demonstrated that protein export from the Golgi is mediated through highly specified motifs. For example, vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein uses the Tyr-based di-acidic motif found in its cytoplasm tail to export from the TGN through recruiting adaptor protein complex 3 (19Nishimura N. Plutner H. Hahn K. Balch W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6755-6760Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic N-terminal positively charged residues are necessary for the efficient export of inward rectifier potassium channels from the Golgi complex (20Stockklausner C. Klocker N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17000-17005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, the specific sequences for exit from the Golgi of the GPCR superfamily have not been identified. As an initial approach to understanding the export pathways for different GPCRs, we focused on the adrenergic (AR) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) (14Duvernay M.T. Zhou F. Wu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30741-30750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 21Wu G. Zhao G. He Y. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 1571-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that Rab1, a Ras-like small GTPase that coordinates protein transport specifically from the ER to the Golgi, selectively regulates the transport of AT1R and β2-AR. In contrast, the transport from the ER to the cell surface of α2B-AR is independent of Rab1 (21Wu G. Zhao G. He Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47062-47069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These data demonstrated that different GPCRs may use distinct pathways for their transport from the ER to the cell surface. Most importantly, the transport of α2B-AR from the ER to the cell surface is mediated through a non-conventional Rab1-independent pathway. We then identified a motif consisting of a Phe and double Leu spaced by six residues (FX6LL), which is required for the export of AT1R and α2B-AR from the ER (14Duvernay M.T. Zhou F. Wu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30741-30750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This motif is highly conserved in the membrane-proximal C termini of GPCRs and, therefore, may provide a common signal in mediating export of the receptors from the ER. To further define the intrinsic structural determinants for GPCR export trafficking, in this manuscript we determined the role of the N termini of α2-ARs in the transport from the ER to the cell surface. We demonstrated that the single Met-6 residue modulates α2B-AR export from the ER, and the Tyr-Ser motif, which is highly conserved in the membrane-proximal N termini of all α2-AR subtypes, regulates exit of α2A-AR and α2B-AR from the Golgi. These data provide strong evidence for the first time indicating that the N termini of GPCRs contain multiple signals modulating the export of the receptors from distinct intracellular compartments.

Plasmid Constructions—α2B-AR tagged with GFP at its C terminus (α2B-AR-GFP) was generated as described previously (21Wu G. Zhao G. He Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47062-47069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). For generation of GFP-tagged α2B-AR-12 construct in which the N-terminal 12 amino acid residues (Ser-2—Ser-13) were deleted from α2B-AR, the full-length α2B-AR-GFP was amplified by PCR (forward primer, 5′-GATCAAGCTTATGGTGCAGGCCACCGCCGCCATCGCGTCG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GATCGTCGACGCCCAGCCAGTCTGGGTC-3′) in which the truncated α2B-AR was in-frame with GFP, restricted with HindIII and SalI, and ligated into the pEGFP-N1 vector (Invitrogen). Similar strategies were used to generate C-terminal GFP-tagged α2A-AR and the α2A-AR mutant lacking the N-terminal 28 residues (Gly-2—Ser-29). For generation of the C-terminal YFP-tagged α2B-AR, α2B-AR was released from the pEGFP-N1 vector by digestion with HindIII and SalI and ligated into the pEYFP-N1 vectors (Invitrogen), which was cleaved with the same restriction enzymes. Receptor mutants were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using GFP-tagged receptors as templates. The sequence of each construct used in this study was verified by restriction mapping and nucleotide sequence analysis (Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center DNA Sequence Core). Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transient transfection of the HEK293T cells was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent as described previously (21Wu G. Zhao G. He Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47062-47069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). For measurement of cell-surface receptor expression and ERK1/2 activation, HEK293T cells were cultured on 6-well plates and transfected with 0.5 μg of GFP-tagged receptors. To determine the influence of the endocytotic pathway on α2B-AR expression at the cell surface, HEK293T cells were transfected with 0.25 μg of GFP-tagged α2B-AR or its mutants together with 0.75 μg of dominant negative mutants Arr3-(201-409), DynK44A, or Rab5S34N. For co-localization with pDsRed2-ER, an ER marker, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of pDsRed2-ER and equal amounts of receptors. The transfection efficiency was estimated to be about 80% based on the GFP fluorescence. Measurement of α2-AR Expression at the Cell Surface—Cell-surface α2-AR expression was measured by [3H]RX821002 binding to intact cells. HEK293T cells were cultured on 6-well plates and transfected with α2-AR constructs for 6 h. The cells were then split onto poly-l-lysine-coated 12-well plates at a density of 4 × 105 cells/well and grown for 24 h. To determine whether the reduced temperature could rescue the transport of mutated α2B-AR, HEK293T cells were grown at 30 °C for 40 h after being split onto 12-well plates. To determine the effect of the chemical chaperone Me2SO on α2B-AR export, HEK293T cells were cultured at 37 °C for 24 h and then incubated with Me2SO at a concentration of 2% for another 24 h. The cells were incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 nm [3H]RX821002 for 90 min at room temperature with constant shaking (40 rpm). The nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of nonradioactive rauwolscine (10 μm). The cells were washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the cell surface-bound [3H]RX821002 was extracted by 1 m NaOH treatment for 2 h at 37 °C. The radioactivity was counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry in 5 ml of Ecoscint A scintillation solution (National Diagnostics, Inc., Atlanta, GA). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HEK293T cells were grown on coverslips and fixed with a 4% paraformaldehyde, 4% sucrose mixture in PBS for 15 min. The cells were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 5 min, and the coverslips were mounted. For co-localization of the receptor with intracellular markers, HEK293T cells were permeabilized with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min and blocked with 5% normal donkey serum for 1 h. The cells were then incubated with antibodies against GM130 or p230 (1:50) for 1 h. After washing with PBS (3 × 5 min), the cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 594-labeled secondary antibody (1:2000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. The fluorescence was detected with a Leica DMRA2 epifluorescent microscope. For co-localization of YFP-tagged receptors with the ER marker pECFP-ER in live cells, HEK293T cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-precoated 35-mm glass bottom dishes and transiently transfected with 100 ng of YFP-tagged receptor and 100 ng of the ER marker pECFP-ER with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent for 24 h. One hour before imaging, culture medium was replaced with CO2-independent medium (Invitrogen). Fluorescence was detected with a Zeiss Axiovert microscope (200M). Images were deconvolved using SlideBook software and the nearest neighbors deconvolution algorithm (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Denver, CO). Measurement of ERK1/2 Activation—HEK293T cells were cultured on 6-well plates and transfected as described above. At 36 h after transient transfection, HEK293T cells were starved for at least 3 h and then stimulated with UK14304 at concentrations from 0.01 to 10 μm for 5 min. Stimulation was terminated by the addition of 1 × SDS gel loading buffer. After solubilizing the cells, 20 μl of total cell lysates was separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The ERK1/2 activation was determined by measuring the levels of phosphorylation of ERK1/2 with phosphospecific ERK1/2 antibodies (21Wu G. Zhao G. He Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47062-47069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The signal was detected using ECL Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and a Fuji Film luminescent image analyzer (LAS-1000 Plus) and quantitated using the Image Gauge program (Version 3.4). The membranes were stripped and reprobed with anti-ERK1/2 antibodies to confirm equal protein loading. Immunoprecipitation of α2B-AR—HEK293T cells cultured on 100-mm dishes were transfected with 4 μg of HA-tagged α2B-AR together with 4 μg of the pEGFP-N1 vector or GFP-tagged wild-type or mutated α2B-AR in the pEGFP-N1 vector for 28 h. The cells were washed twice with PBS and harvested. The cells were then lysed with 500 μl of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture. After gentle rotation for 1 h, samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 × g, and the supernatant was incubated with 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose for 1 h at 4°C to remove nonspecific bound proteins. Samples were then incubated with 5 μg of anti-GFP antibodies overnight at 4 °C with gentle rotation followed by an incubation with 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads for 5 h. Resin was collected by centrifugation and washed 3 × 500 μl of lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitated receptors were eluted with 100 μl of 1 × SDS-PAGE loading buffer, separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, and visualized by immunoblotting using anti-HA antibodies. Statistical Analysis—Differences were evaluated using Student's t test, and p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. A Requirement of the N terminus of α2B-AR for the Transport to the Cell Surface—We have recently identified the FX6LL motif in the membrane-proximal C termini of α2B-AR and AT1R, which is required for their export from the ER (14Duvernay M.T. Zhou F. Wu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30741-30750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To further define the structural determinants for export trafficking of GPCRs, we determined the role of the N terminus of α2B-AR in its anterograde trafficking from the ER to the cell surface. We first determined the effect of deleting the entire N terminus on the transport of α2B-AR to the cell surface. α2B-AR and its mutant lacking N-terminal 12 amino acid residues (Ser-2—Ser-13) (α2B-AR-12) were conjugated with the GFP at their C termini and transiently expressed in HEK293T cells. The cell-surface expression of α2B-AR-12 was markedly reduced by 95% as compared with wild-type (WT) α2B-AR as measured by intact cell ligand binding using [3H]RX821002 (Fig. 1A). Consistent with the lack of α2B-AR-12 cell-surface expression as measured by ligand binding, ERK1/2 activation by the agonist UK14304 was completely lost in cells transfected with α2B-AR-12 (Fig. 1B). In contrast, ERK1/2 activation was stimulated dose-dependently by UK14304 in cells transiently transfected with α2B-AR (Fig. 1B). Subcellular localization of the receptors indicated that α2B-AR-12 was trapped in the perinuclear region, whereas α2B-AR was mainly localized at the cell surface (Fig. 1C), which was confirmed by co-localization with tetramethylrhodamine-conjugated concanavalin A, a plasma membrane marker (data not shown). These data indicate that the extracellular N-terminal portion is required for α2B-AR transport to the cell surface. Identification of Amino Acid Residues in the N Terminus Required for the Cell-surface Expression of α2B-AR—To identify amino acid residues important for α2B-AR cell-surface expression, each amino acid residue (except Gly-3) in the N terminus (2SGPTMDHQEPYS13) (Fig. 2A) was substituted with Ala individually or in combination, and the cell-surface expression of each receptor mutant was determined by intact cell ligand binding. Mutation of Ser-2, Pro-4, Thr-5, Asp-7, His-8, Gln-9, Glu-10, and Pro-11 to Ala did not significantly influence the cell-surface expression of α2B-AR. In contrast, single substitution of Met-6 with Ala abolished α2B-AR transport to the cell surface, and mutation of Tyr-12 and Ser-13 significantly attenuated the cell-surface expression of α2B-AR by 65 and 55%, respectively, as compared with WT α2B-AR (Fig. 2B). Simultaneous mutation of Tyr-12 and Ser-13 (Y12A/S13A) to Ala more profoundly inhibited the cell-surface expression of α2B-AR than either mutant (Fig. 2B). Western blot analysis of total cell lysate using anti-GFP antibodies demonstrated that the reduction in the cell-surface expression of the mutant receptors was not due to the differences in total receptor expression as expression levels of these mutants were comparable with their WT (Fig. 2C). Consistent with the attenuated cell-surface expression, ERK1/2 activation in response to stimulation with UK14304 was also significantly inhibited in cells transfected with M6A, Y12A, S13A, or Y12A/S13A when compared with cells transfected with WT α2B-AR (Fig. 2D). The subcellular localization of each α2B-AR mutant was then visualized. Consistent with quantitative measurement of receptor expression at the cell surface by intact cell ligand binding, M6A mutant was completely unable to transport to the cell surface, and Y12A and S13A mutants were partially trapped inside the cells. In contrast, S2A, P4A, T5A, D7A, H8A, Q9A, E10A, and P11A mutants exhibited clear cell-surface expression patterns (Fig. 2E). Ala substitution of Val-14, Gln-15, and Thr-17 at the beginning of the first transmembrane domain also did not significantly influence the cell-surface expression and subcellular localization of α2B-AR (data not shown). These data strongly indicate that three residues, Met-6, Tyr-12, and Ser-13, at the N terminus are critical for α2B-AR export to the cell surface. Residues Met-6, Tyr-12, and Ser-13 Modulate α2B-AR Export at Distinct Organelles—The preceding data have demonstrated that residues Met-6, Tyr-12, and Ser-13 in the α2B-AR N terminus are required for cell-surface targeting. Interestingly, the subcellular localization pattern of M6A mutant is apparently different from those of Y12A, S13A, and Y12A/S13A mutants. To define the intracellular compartments in which the α2B-AR mutants M6A, Y12A, S13A, and Y12A/S13A were retained, each mutant was co-localized with markers of the ER, the Golgi, and the TGN. M6A mutant as well as α2B-AR-12 was extensively co-localized with the ER marker pDsRed2-ER (Fig. 3A) but not with the Golgi marker GM130 and the TGN marker p230 (data not shown) in fixed cells. To eliminate the possible nonspecific influence of cell fixation on the subcellular localization of α2B-AR, α2B-AR and its mutant M6A were tagged with YFP at their C termini, and their subcellular co-localization with the ER marker pECFP-ER was visualized by microscopic analysis in live cells. Similar to the results obtained from the fixed cells, M6A mutant was strongly co-localized with pECFP-ER in live HEK293T cells (Fig. 3B). These data demonstrate that M6A mutant was unable to export from the ER and indicate that Met-6 modulates α2B-AR export at the level of the ER. In contrast to M6A retained in the ER, Y12A, S13A, and Y12A/S13A, mutants were strongly co-localized with GM130 (Fig. 4A) but not with pDsRed2-ER (data not shown) and p230 (Fig. 4B). Similar results were obtained from COS-7 cells (data not shown), suggesting the role of the Tyr-12—Ser-13 motif in modulating α2B-AR export is not cell-type specific. These data demonstrate that these mutants were able to exit from the ER and transport to the Golgi, but their abilities to export from the Golgi to the TGN were impaired. These data indicate that the Tyr-12—Ser-13 motif modulates α2B-AR export at the level of the Golgi. Effect of the Dominant Negative Mutants of Arrestin-3, Dynamin, and Rab5 and Treatment with BFA on α2B-AR Export—To eliminate the possibility that the accumulation of the Y12A, S13A, and Y12A/S13A mutants in the Golgi is caused by their constitutive internalization induced by the mutation, we determined the effect of transient expression of the dominant negative mutants Arr3-(201-409), DynK44A, and Rab5S34N on the cell-surface expression and subcellular localization of the mutated receptors. Arrestin-3 and dynamin modulate α2B-AR endocytotic trafficking, and Rab5 is involved in the transport from the plasma membrane to the endosome of many GPCRs (3Duvernay M.T. Filipeanu C.M. Wu G. Cell. Signal. 2005; 17: 1457-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 25DeGraff J.L. Gagnon A.W. Benovic J.L. Orsini M.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 43247-43252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Expression of Arr3-(201-409), DynK44A, and Rab5S34N did not have clear influence on the cell-surface expression (Fig. 5A) or subcellular localization (data not shown) of α2B-AR and its mutants Y12A, S13A, and Y12A/S13A. We then determined the effect of blocking anterograde protein transport by BFA treatment on the cell-surface expression and subcellular localization of the Tyr-Ser motif mutants. BFA is a fungal metabolite that disrupts the structures of the Golgi and blocks protein transport from the ER to the Golgi. Treatment with BFA dramatically inhibited the cell-surface expression of α2B-AR and almost abolished the cell-surface expression of Y12A, S13A, and Y12A/S13A mutants (Fig. 5B). BFA treatment arrested α2B-AR in the perinuclear regions of the transfected cells, presumably in the ER. Y12A, S13A, and Y12A/S13A mutants were redistributed from the Golgi to the ER in the presence of BFA (Fig. 5C). These data suggest that the Golgi accumulation of the Tyr-Ser motif mutants is likely caused by defective export from the Golgi rather than the constitutive endocytotic transport from the plasma membrane. Hydrophobic Properties of Met-6 and Tyr-12 Are Important for Their Function in α2B-AR Export—To characterize physiochemical properties required for the function of Met-6, Tyr-12, and Ser-13 in α2B-AR transport to the cell surface, we first determined if hydrophobicity of Met-6 and Tyr-12 played a role in their function by mutating them to hydrophobic residues (M6L and Y12F) and non-hydrophobic residue (M6Q and Y12Q). The cell-surface expression of M6L and Y12F mutants was markedly enhanced as compared with M6A and Y12A mutants, respectively. In contrast, the cell-surface expression of M6Q and Y12Q mutants was the same as their respective Ala mutants (Fig. 6, A and C). Consistently, subcellular localization analysis showed that M6L and Y12F mutants were able to transport to the cell surface, whereas M6Q and Y12Q mutants were trapped inside the cell (Fig. 6, B and D). These data indicate that the hydrophobic characteristics of the residues Met-6 and Tyr-12 are crucial for their function in α2B-AR export. We next determined if the function of Tyr-12 and Ser-13 residues in α2B-AR export was regulated by their potential phosphorylation. Similar to the mutation to Ala, substitution of Tyr-12 and Ser-13 with Asp, which will mimic the status of phosphorylation, significantly attenuated α2B-AR export to the cell surface (Fig. 6E). Mutation of Ser-13 to Thr also inhibited receptor expression at the cell surface (Fig. 6E). These data suggest that phosphorylation of Tyr-12 and Ser-13 residues is unlikely involved in regulating α2B-AR export. Rescue of M6A and Y12A/S13A Transport by Low Temperature and Me2SO Treatment—To determine if Met-6 and the Tyr-Ser motif are involved in the proper α2B-AR folding, we determined the effect of low temperature culture and treatment with Me2SO, a chemical chaperone, on the cell-surface expression of the M6A and Y12A/S13A mutants. HEK293T cells cultured at a reduced temperature (30 °C) significantly enhanced the cell-surface expression of M6A mutant without influencing WT α2B-AR transport as measured by intact cell"
https://openalex.org/W2001110683,"In mammals, coat complex II (COPII)-coated transport vesicles deliver secretory cargo to vesicular tubular clusters (VTCs) that facilitate cargo sorting and transport to the Golgi. We documented in vitro tethering and SNARE-dependent homotypic fusion of endoplasmic reticulum-derived COPII transport vesicles to form larger cargo containers characteristic of VTCs (Xu, D., and Hay, J. C. (2004) J. Cell Biol. 167, 997-1003). COPII vesicles thus appear to contain all necessary components for homotypic tethering and fusion, providing a pathway for de novo VTC biogenesis. Here we demonstrate that antibodies against the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi SNARE Syntaxin 5 inhibit COPII vesicle homotypic tethering as well as fusion, implying an unanticipated role for SNAREs upstream of fusion. Inhibition of SNARE complex access and/or disassembly with dominant-negative α-soluble NSF attachment protein (SNAP) also inhibited tethering, implicating SNARE status as a critical determinant in COPII vesicle tethering. The tethering-defective vesicles generated in the presence of dominant-negative α-SNAP specifically lacked the Rab1 effectors p115 and GM130 but not other peripheral membrane proteins. Furthermore, Rab effectors, including p115, were shown to be required for homotypic COPII vesicle tethering. Thus, our results demonstrate a requirement for SNARE-dependent tether recruitment and function in COPII vesicle fusion. We anticipate that recruitment of tether molecules by an upstream SNARE signal ensures that tethering events are initiated only at focal sites containing appropriately poised fusion machinery. In mammals, coat complex II (COPII)-coated transport vesicles deliver secretory cargo to vesicular tubular clusters (VTCs) that facilitate cargo sorting and transport to the Golgi.

We anticipate that recruitment of tether molecules by an upstream SNARE signal ensures that tethering events are initiated only at focal sites containing appropriately poised fusion machinery. Vesicle targeting and fusion in the endomembrane system are mediated by several conserved protein families. Rab GTPases bind vesicles and activate and/or recruit effectors for several processes upstream of fusion, including the proper formation or loading of vesicles (1Allan B.B. Moyer B.D. Balch W.E.

Some of the defining characteristics of tethers appear to be as follows: 1) they are regulated/recruited by Rabs; 2) they are peripheral membrane proteins; 3) they are composed of long rope-like proteins or large oligomeric complexes; 4) they form membrane-bridging complexes; and 5) their initial action precedes and is independent of SNARE function (5Broadie K.

Trans-SNARE complex assembly is believed by many in the field to represent the most distal trigger of membrane fusion (9Xu D. Hay J.C. Segev N. Alfonso A. Payne G. Donaldson J. Intracellular Membrane Fusion. 2006Google Scholar). The current view is that these 4-helix bundles draw the two membranes into very close proximity until ultimately overcoming the hydrostatic barrier to membrane fusion. Sec1/Munc18 proteins are the best candidates for later stage conformational regulators of SNARE complex formation or organization (10Toonen R.F. Verhage M.

Cell. 2004; 15: 162-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A functional link between tethers and SNAREs has emerged, and a number of physical interactions between these sets of proteins have been reported (1Allan B.B. Moyer B.D. Balch W.E. Science. 2000; 289: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 8Shorter J. Beard M.B. Seemann J. Dirac-Svejstrup A.B. Warren G. J.

Current models propose that tethering proceeds upstream of and independently of SNAREs, and then tether-SNARE interactions recruit SNAREs to the site of future membrane fusion and activate or facilitate trans-SNARE interactions. For example, in vitro SNARE assembly studies involving the Rab1 effector p115 and ER/Golgi SNAREs suggested that during Golgi reassembly p115 first mediated membrane tethering through its interactions with other Golgi tethers, and then facilitated trans-SNARE complex formation via direct p115-SNARE interactions (8Shorter J. Beard M.B. Seemann J. Dirac-Svejstrup A.B. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 45-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Transport from the ER to the Golgi is one of the most studied steps in the endomembrane system because of its rate-limiting role in protein secretion and quality control, and much of the docking and fusion machinery required for this process have been identified. Rab1 appears to represent a coordinating factor for transport and has a number of effectors (1Allan B.B. Moyer B.D. Balch W.E. Science. 2000; 289: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). These include the putative tethering protein p115 (Uso1p in yeast), which is required for anterograde transport (19Alvarez C. Garcia-Mata R. Hauri H.P. Sztul E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2693-2700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The peripheral membrane protein GM130, another Rab1 effector, and integral Golgi vesicle protein Giantin are proposed to work in complex with p115 as tethers and are required for anterograde ER-to-Golgi transport at a late step as well as intra-Golgi transport (19Alvarez C.

The seven-member TRAPP complex includes subunits mBet3 and Sedlin, is required for anterograde transport, and may represent a second tethering system for ER-to-Golgi transport and a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rab1 (22Sacher M.

Scheller R.H. Cell. 1997; 89: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). These four proteins are required for ER-to-Golgi transport and form a well characterized quaternary complex that has served as a prototype for intracellular SNARE complexes (26Xu D. Joglekar A.P.

Syntaxin 5 interacts with the Sec1/Munc18 protein rSly1; both the interaction and rSly1 itself are essential to fusion (11Williams A.L. Ehm S. Jacobson N.C. Xu D. Hay J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 162-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Membrane fusion in ER-to-Golgi transport was initially thought to occur between ER-derived COPII vesicles and the cis-Golgi. However, live imaging studies demonstrated that cargo transport in mammalian systems is primarily mediated not by small vesicles but by larger vesicular tubular clusters (VTCs) that travel along microtubules to the Golgi (28Presley J.F. Cole N.B. Schroer T.A. Hirschberg K. Zaal K.J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Nature. 1997; 389: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 29Scales S.J. Pepperkok R. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 1137-1148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Some VTCs may be long lived and relatively immobile sorting stations that give rise to the transient, mobile structures (30Ben-Tekaya H. Miura K. Pepperkok R. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 357-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). ER-to-Golgi cargo transport must involve at least two membrane fusions as follows: one to transfer cargo from COPII vesicles into VTCs in the periphery of the cell, and a second to transfer cargo from Golgi-centric VTCs into the cis-Golgi (or alternatively to create the cis-Golgi de novo). This complexity of fusion events has not been dissected using in vitro reconstitutions of ER-to-Golgi transport (1Allan B.B. Moyer B.D. Balch W.E. Science. 2000; 289: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 31Beckers C.J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 32Cao X. Barlowe C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). One simple model of VTC biogenesis holds that COPII vesicles fuse with each other homotypically to form nascent VTCs. Nascent VTCs may then expand by further fusion with COPII vesicles. Consistent with this model, VTCs (33Bannykh S.I. Rowe T. Balch W.E. J.

Thus, homotypic COPII vesicle fusion appears to represent at least one pre-Golgi membrane fusion contributing to VTC biogenesis. Little is known about the mechanism of homotypic COPII vesicle fusion other than that it requires the Syntaxin 5 SNARE complex, rSly1, and the TRAPP subunit mBet3 (36Xu D. Hay J.C. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 997-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 37Yu S. Satoh A. Pypaert M. Mullen K. Hay J.C. Ferro-Novick S. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Whether p115, GM130, or other Rab effectors are involved in homotypic COPII vesicle fusion has not been determined. Antibodies and Reagents—Affinity-purified rabbit anti-Syntaxin 5 and rBet1 antibodies (25Hay J.C. Chao D.S. Kuo C.S. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1997; 89: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and anti-p115 (19Alvarez C. Garcia-Mata R. Hauri H.P. Sztul E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2693-2700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) were described previously. Antibodies used in functional assays were purified on antigen affinity columns in the absence of detergent and dialyzed extensively in 25/125 Buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 125 mm potassium acetate). Antibody concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm, assuming 1 OD unit equals 0.8 mg/ml of rabbit IgG. Anti-Myc antibody was purified on protein A-Sepharose from tissue culture medium employed to grow the 9E10 hybridoma and then biotinylated with sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce). Anti-Syntaxin 5 and preimmune Fabs were produced by papain digestion using a kit from Pierce. Following near-complete IgG digestion, intact IgG and Fc fragments were removed by passing the reaction over a protein A column. Gel analysis confirmed that our Fab preparations lacked any detectable antibody heavy chain (not shown). Anti-GM130 was a kind gift from Dr. Martin Lowe (University of Manchester). Anti-p24, Sec23, and β-COP were produced in rabbits against synthetic peptides, and then affinity-purified using columns with the immobilized peptides (p24 peptide, CQMRHLKSFFEAKKLV; Sec23 peptide, CQQNEERDGVRFSWNVWPSSR; and β-COP peptide, CKKEAGELKPEEEITVGPVQK). Anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (product number sc20357). Lysophosphatidylcholine (1-lauroyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) in powder form, weighed freshly for each use, and dispersed by vortexing for 1 min in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 125 mm potassium acetate (25/125 buffer) at a concentration of 2 mm. This suspension was added to tethering/fusion reactions at ≥240 μm. Previous users of this reagent reported significant inhibition of biological membrane fusion with 100 μm lipid (38Vogel S.S. Leikina E.A. Chernomordik L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25764-25768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, we did not observe inhibition until ∼200 μm.We speculate that its potency in membrane fusion may depend upon the physical state of the lipid dispersion. Preparation of Purified Recombinant Proteins—His-α-SNAP wild type and L294A plasmids were obtained from Dr. Phyllis Hanson (Washington University, St. Louis) and expressed in Escherichia coli using pET-28. 3 liters of culture was grown in LB containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.4-0.6, at which time the cultures were induced with 0.5 mm IPTG at 37 °C for 2 h. Induced bacterial pellets were resuspended in 60 ml of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and protease inhibitors (Complete EDTA-free; Roche Applied Science), disrupted twice with a French press, and clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min followed by 100,000 × g for 1 h. The final lysates were applied to a 2.5-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.3 m NaCl, washed, and eluted with the same buffer containing 25 mm imidazole and then with a 50-ml gradient from 25 to 250 mm imidazole. Essentially homogeneous α-SNAP protein eluted at around 100 mm imidazole, and was pooled, dialyzed extensively against 25/125 Buffer, and stored in aliquots at -80 °C until use. Quantitation of all recombinant proteins was performed by Coomassie staining in SDS gels relative to BSA standards. Vector pET3 expressing his-Rab-GDI was obtained from Dr. William Balch (Scripps Institute, La Jolla, CA). 3 liters of cultured E. coli strain BL21 harboring this construct was grown at 37 °C in LB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin to an absorbance at 600 nm, at which time the culture was shifted to 15 °C for 30 min and then induced with 1 mm IPTG for 2 h. Induced bacterial pellets were resuspended in 60 ml of French Press Buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA and protease inhibitors as above), French pressed twice, and clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min followed by 100,000 × g for 1 h. The final lysate was applied to a 2.5-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column equilibrated in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.3 m NaCl, washed, and eluted with the same buffer containing 25 mm imidazole and then with a 50-ml gradient from 25 to 250 mm imidazole. Rab-GDI eluted in the 25 mm imidazole buffer and was pooled, dialyzed extensively against 25/125 Buffer, and stored in aliquots at -80 °C until use. Tetanus toxin light chain (TTLC) was expressed as a control protein from vector pQE-3 by induction with 0.5 mm IPTG for 2 h at 37°C in LB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml kanamycin. The induced bacterial pellet was resuspended and processed similarly to that of Rab-GDI. Like Rab-GDI, TTLC eluted in the 25 mm imidazole eluate and gave a similar yield of protein per liter of culture as the Rab-GDI construct. GST-Sar1a T39N in a pGEX vector was obtained from Drs. Jinoh Kim and Randy Schekman (University of California, Berkeley). 3 liters of culture was grown in LB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C to an optical density of 0.4-0.6, and then protein expression was induced by addition of 1 mm IPTG for 2 h. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in French Press Buffer containing 1 mm DTT, 10 μm GDP, and 5 mm magnesium acetate, and a soluble extract was prepared as for Rab-GDI above. The final extract was loaded onto a 2-ml glutathione-Sepharose column, washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 μm GDP and 5 mm magnesium acetate, and eluted with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mm glutathione, 10 μm GDP, and 5 mm magnesium acetate. The purified GST-Sar1a T39N was then digested with thrombin, dialyzed extensively against 25/125 Buffer containing 10 μm GDP and 5 mm magnesium acetate, and stored at -70 °C. Co-isolation and Heterotrimerization Assays—Experiments were carried out as described before (36Xu D. Hay J.C. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 997-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, the VSV-G-myc-expressing cells and pulse-radiolabeled VSV-G*-containing cells were permeabilized by scraping with a rubber policeman, then washed, and resuspended at 125 μl/10-cm plate in 50/90 Buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 90 mm potassium acetate). A first-stage (vesicle release) incubation to produce enough vesicles for an 18-point assay contained 1.45 ml and consisted of 320 μl of water, 50 μl of 0.1 m magnesium acetate, 100 μl of ATP-regenerating system, 30 μl of 1 m Hepes, pH 7.2, 200 μl of Calcium Buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 18 mm CaCl2, and 50 mm EGTA), 500 μl of dialyzed rat liver cytosol, and 250 μl of either permeabilized cell population. After incubation at 32 °C for 30 min to allow vesicle release, cells were removed by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 1 min followed by 15,000 × g for 1 min. The supernatant, which contains released COPII vesicles, was saved. For the second-stage (tethering/fusion) incubations, each reaction totaled 200 μl and contained 72.5 μl of VSV-G-myc vesicles, 72.5 μl of VSV-G* vesicles, and 55 μl of 25/125 Buffer or purified test proteins dialyzed into 25/125 Buffer. After a 20-min preincubation on ice, the second-stage reactions were incubated at 32 °C for 60 min. For measuring co-isolation, the final intact vesicle suspensions were processed for immunoisolation using 5 μg of biotinylated anti-Myc antibodies and 5 μl (packed) of streptavidin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoisolates were solubilized in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (8%) and phosphorimaging, and co-isolated VSV-G* was quantified. For heterotrimer assays, the final vesicle suspensions were supplemented with 2% Triton X-100, incubated with agitation at 4 °C for 20 min, and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The 100,000 × g supernatants containing solubilized VSV-G trimers were then processed for immunoprecipitation using biotinylated anti-Myc antibody and streptavidin-Sepharose, and co-precipitated VSV-G* was quantified. Immunoblotting of Transport Intermediates—Only VSV-G-myc-expressing cells were employed because radioactivity was inconsequential to this assay. After scraping and washing, the cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of 50/90 Buffer per 10-cm plate. This suspension was diluted with 0.5 ml of 50/90 Buffer containing 1.5 m KCl and 1 mg/ml BSA, and the suspension was kept on ice and resuspended once every 2-3 min for 15 min. The suspension was next diluted with 1 ml of 50/90 containing 1 mg/ml BSA, and the cells were sedimented by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 3 min. Cell pellets were then resuspended in 2 ml of 50/90 Buffer containing 1 mg/ml BSA, sedimented once more, and finally resuspended in 100 μl of 50/90 Buffer per original plate. Cells treated in this way were functional for vesicle release, co-isolation, and heterotrimer assays (36Xu D. Hay J.C. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 997-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Each immunoisolation condition involved a reaction volume of 600 μl and contained the following: 96 μl of water, 15 μl of 0.1 m magnesium acetate, 30 μl of ATP-regenerating system, 9 μ l of 1 m Hepes, pH 7.2, 60 μl of Calcium Buffer, 150 μl of dialyzed rat liver cytosol, 165 μl of 25/125 Buffer or test proteins dialyzed in this buffer, and 75 μl of salt-extracted VSV-G-myc-expressing cells. Vesicle release, tethering, and fusion were allowed to occur in a single 90-min incubation at 32 °C because we wanted the test proteins to be present from the inception of vesicle biogenesis. After vesicle release/tethering/fusion, cells were removed by centrifugation as above. The vesicle-containing supernatant was supplemented with 5 μg of anti-Myc antibody and incubated for 2 h with agitation. The suspension was then cleared by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 1 min followed by addition of 15 μl (packed) of protein A-Sepharose beads (preblocked in 5 mg/ml milk and 5 mg/ml PVP-40T in 25/125 Buffer) and further mixing at 4 °C for 4-6 h or overnight. Beads were washed four times by centrifugation at 375 × g for 1 min and resuspension in 25/125 Buffer containing 1 mg/ml BSA. During the last wash, resuspended beads were transferred to a fresh tube. After the washes, proteins were eluted from the beads by addition of 50 μl of 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5, mixing, centrifugation at 375 × g for 1 min, and removing the supernatant to a tube containing 7.5 μl of 2 m Tris, pH 8.0. Elution was repeated twice more into this eluate pool (157.5 μl of total eluate) and the eluate pool was placed into a Microcon YM-10 ultrafiltration device (Amicon) and centrifuged to dryness. The sample on the membrane was dissolved in 25 μl of SDS sample buffer and analyzed by 4-20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels and immunoblotting. A preceding report described assays to detect homotypic COPII vesicle tethering and fusion (36Xu D. Hay J.C. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 997-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, two COPII vesicle populations, marked in different ways, are generated from permeabilized normal rat kidney (NRK) cells. One population of vesicles contains Myc-tagged VSV-G tsO45 (VSV-G-myc), and the second population of vesicles contains untagged but radiolabeled VSV-G* (see Fig. 1A). After the vesicles are released in a first-stage incubation, the permeabilized donor cells are removed, and the differently marked vesicle populations are combined and incubated together in a second-stage incubation during which tethering and fusion between the two vesicle populations occurs. These events can be detected subsequently as follows: VSV-G*-containing radiolabeled vesicles that interact with VSV-G-myc vesicles can be co-immunoisolated, intact, from the supernatant with anti-Myc antibody and detected with autoradiography. As depicted in Fig. 1A, this “co-isolation” assay scores tethering or a mixture of tethering and fusion but cannot distinguish these possibilities. On the other hand, heterotrimeric VSV-G molecules that contain both VSV-G-myc and VSV-G* form only following fusion and membrane mixing and can be detected specifically by immunoprecipitation in the presence of detergent. This socalled “heterotrimer” assay specifically reports fusion; by utilizing both assays, the tethering and fusion processes can be distinguished and dissected. Extensive analyses employing these assays indicated that other types of vesicles such as Golgi, ER, pre-existing VTCs, and COPI vesicles were either not present or not required for in vitro generation of nascent VTCs, providing the most direct evidence to date that COPII vesicles can tether and fuse homotypically to generate pre-Golgi intermediates de novo (36Xu D. Hay J.C. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 997-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A Role for SNAREs Upstream of Fusion in Homotypic COPII Vesicle Tethering—Fusion of COPII vesicles to form pre-Golgi intermediates required the ER-Golgi SNARE complex, because the heterotrimer assay was inhibited by anti-Syntaxin 5 and anti-rSly antibodies and by addition of ∼1 μm of dominant-negative α-SNAP L294A (36Xu D. Hay J.C. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 997-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The inhibitory properties of α-SNAP L294A arise from its association with SNARE complexes and NSF but failure to stimulate NSF ATPase activity, creating a block in SNARE recycling (39Barnard R.J. Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 875-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Curiously, α-SNAP L294A significantly inhibited the co-isolation assay as well as the heterotrimer assay (36Xu D. Hay J.C. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 997-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Although we speculated that this might be indicative of an unexpected role for SNAREs upstream of fusion, we could not rule out the simpler possibility that fusion was required for a robust co-isolation signal. To investigate the potential role for SNAREs upstream of fusion more thoroughly, we tested anti-Syntaxin 5 antibodies at different concentrations and monitored both the co-isolation and heterotrimer signals. As shown in Fig. 1B, 100 nm anti-Syntaxin 5 antibody fully inhibited the heterotrimer assay to near background without any inhibition (or perhaps even a slight stimulation) of the co-isolation signal performed in parallel. This demonstrates that membrane fusion is not a requirement for a robust co-isolation signal. On the other hand, 175 nm of the antibody caused an ∼40% inhibition (∼66% relative to the ice background) of co-isolation (Fig. 1B). Thus, it appears that anti-Syntaxin 5 antibody interferes with an earlier and distinct Syntaxin 5-dependent process when employed at higher concentrations. The effects on co-isolation are immune-specific because protein A-purified nonimmune IgG (Fig. 1B) or other irrelevant antibodies (data not shown) can be included with no inhibition of co-isolation. We do not know why the antibody inhibited co-isolation less potently than the fusion assay, but we speculate that perhaps lower affinity epitopes mediate that inhibition. To confirm that the inhibition of co-isolation was not an indirect steric consequence of antibody binding, we produced monovalent Fab fragments from the affinity-purified bivalent antibodies tested in Fig. 1B. As shown in Fig. 1C, anti-Syntaxin 5 Fab fragments inhibited both the co-isolation and heterotrimer"
https://openalex.org/W2169704122,"Phox homology (PX) domains, which have been identified in a variety of proteins involved in cell signaling and membrane trafficking, have been shown to interact with phosphoinositides (PIs) with different affinities and specificities. To elucidate the structural origin of diverse PI specificities of PX domains, we determined the crystal structure of the PX domain from phosphoinositide 3-kinase C2alpha (PI3K-C2alpha), which binds phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P(2)). To delineate the mechanism by which this PX domain interacts with membranes, we measured the membrane binding of the wild type domain and mutants by surface plasmon resonance and monolayer techniques. This PX domain contains a signature PI-binding site that is optimized for PtdIns(4,5)P(2) binding. The membrane binding of the PX domain is initiated by nonspecific electrostatic interactions followed by the membrane penetration of hydrophobic residues. Membrane penetration is specifically enhanced by PtdIns(4,5)P(2). Furthermore, the PX domain displayed significantly higher PtdIns(4,5)P(2) membrane affinity and specificity when compared with the PI3K-C2alpha C2 domain, demonstrating that high affinity PtdIns(4,5)P(2) binding was facilitated by the PX domain in full-length PI3K-C2alpha. Together, these studies provide new structural insight into the diverse PI specificities of PX domains and elucidate the mechanism by which the PI3K-C2alpha PX domain interacts with PtdIns(4,5)P(2)-containing membranes and thereby mediates the membrane recruitment of PI3K-C2alpha."
https://openalex.org/W2031117855,"We previously showed that activation of the small GTPase Cdc42 promotes breast cell migration on a collagen matrix. Here we further define the signaling pathways that drive this response and show that Cdc42-mediated migration relies on the adaptor molecule p130Cas. Activated Cdc42 enhanced p130Cas phosphorylation and its binding to Crk. Cdc42-driven migration and p130Cas phosphorylation were dependent on the Cdc42 effector Ack1 (activated Cdc42-associated kinase). Ack1 formed a signaling complex that also included Cdc42, p130Cas, and Crk, formation of which was regulated by collagen stimulation. The interaction between Ack1 and p130Cas occurred through their respective SH3 domains, while the substrate domain of p130Cas was the major site of Ack1-dependent phosphorylation. Signaling through this complex is functionally relevant, because treatment with either p130Cas or Ack1 siRNA blocked Cdc42-induced migration. These results suggest that Cdc42 exerts its effects on cell migration in part through its effector Ack1, which regulates p130Cas signaling.

Integrin-mediated cell interactions with components of the extracellular matrix regulate several aspects of both epithelial polarization and migration. Integrins are involved in signaling pathways that include activation of small GTPases, scaffolding molecules, and protein kinases (1Schoenwaelder S.M. Burridge K. Curr. Opin.

These signaling pathways regulate various aspects of cell migration on integrin ligands, such as collagen. Members of the Rho family of GTPases, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, are important regulators of the actin cytoskeleton and have been shown to mediate cell migration (4Keely P.J. Westwick J.K. Whitehead I.P.

The interaction of p130Cas with Crk has been described as a “molecular switch” for cell migration (35Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J.

Here we demonstrate that Ack1 is a Cdc42 effector that mediates Cdc42-induced migration by modulating p130Cas signaling.

Transfections—HEK cells were transfected for 24–36 h in 100-mm dishes with 4–6 μg of DNA using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. T47D cells were transfected for 48 h with Ack1, p130Cas, or control siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. Migration Assays—T47D cells stably expressing Cdc42(12V) or control pZIP vector were transiently transfected with 50 nm Ack1 siRNA, 200 nm p130Cas siRNA, or control oligonucleotide at appropriate concentrations. 48 h after transfection, cells were detached with 0.05% trypsin, counted, and equal cell numbers were seeded into transwells (Costar) coated on the underside with 100 μg/ml collagen I (BD Bioscience). Cells were allowed to migrate for 16 h. Cells that migrated to the underside were fixed and stained using Diff-Quik (Dade Behring) and mounted using Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Experiments were performed in triplicate with 6–8 fields counted for each transwell, and the total number of cells per transwell was calculated for each condition. Results are reported as averages of the three experiments relative to control pZIP cells, or pZIP cells treated with control siRNA where appropriate. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Subconfluent cells were detached with Versene (phosphate-buffered saline + 0.5 mm EDTA), washed and resuspended in medium containing 5 mg/ml fatty acid free bovine serum albumin. Cells were counted and volumes adjusted such that equal numbers were used for each immunoprecipitation. Cells were stimulated in suspension for 10–20 min at 37 °C with 0.5 mg/ml collagen I that had been neutralized by addition of 2× phosphate-buffered saline + 100 mm Hepes pH 7.3. Cells were then lysed with 2× lysis buffer containing 100 mm Hepes pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 2% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm NaF, 2 mm pervanadate, and 0.1% protease inhibitor mixture III (Calbiochem) for immunoprecipitation experiments, or 100 mm Hepes pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 2% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm NaF, 2 mm pervanadate, and 0.1% protease inhibitor mixture III for co-immunoprecipitations. Lysates were incubated at 4 °C for 15–30 min, and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm. Immunoprecipitations were performed from cleared lysates by the addition of 2–4 μg of appropriate antibody and 30 μl of Gammabind beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 2 h to overnight, washed three times with 1× lysis buffer, and processed for SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride filters (Immobilon-P; Millipore), and the filters were blocked overnight in 5 mg/ml milk, or 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for phosphotyrosine blots. Membranes were immunoblotted for phosphotyrosine content or co-immunoprecipitated proteins and subsequently stripped (100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8) and reblotted for loading. Quantification was performed by measuring the band density of scanned images using ImageJ software. SH3-GST Pulldowns—GST-tagged SH3 domains were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described in Ref. 42Chapman E.R. An S. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol.

Cdc42 Induces Cell Migration through p130Cas—We previously reported that stable expression of constitutively active Cdc42(12V) caused increased migration of T47D breast epithelial cells across collagen (4Keely P.J. Westwick J.K. Whitehead I.P. Der C.J. Parise L.V. Nature. 1997; 390: 632-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). p130Cas becomes phosphorylated upon integrin activation and is one of the key signaling molecules involved in cell migration. Phosphorylated p130Cas binds its effectors, such as Crk, which is required for its effects on cell migration (35Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). First, we wanted to know whether p130Cas was required for Cdc42-induced cell migration. Control (pZIP vector only) and Cdc42(12V)-expressing T47D cells were transiently transfected with siRNA directed against p130Cas or control siRNA, and migration across collagen-coated filters was determined in a transwell assay (43Keely P.J. Fong A.M. Zutter M.M. Santoro S.A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 595-607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cdc42(12V)-expressing cells exhibited a 2–3-fold increase in migration on collagen. Importantly, p130Cas siRNA inhibited migration induced by Cdc42(12V) to baseline levels (Fig. 1A), demonstrating an important role for p130Cas in this migration. To determine whether p130Cas signaling was affected by Cdc42, p130Cas phosphorylation, and binding to Crk were assessed. Collagen treatment caused a substantial increase in p130Cas phosphorylation in control T47D cells. In cells stably expressing activated Cdc42(12V) there was an increase in the baseline level (in absence of collagen) of p130Cas phosphorylation (Fig. 1B) compared with cells expressing control vector, suggesting stimulation of p130Cas downstream of Cdc42 activation. Similarly, the amount of Crk that could be co-immunoprecipitated with p130Cas in unstimulated cells was higher in cells expressing activated Cdc42(12V) than in control cells (Fig. 1C). Collagen stimulation could further increase Crk binding to p130Cas in both control and Cdc42(12V)-expressing cells, suggesting that additional signaling pathways downstream of collagen stimulation also contribute to this effect. As a complementary approach, HEK cells were transfected with either activated (61L) or dominant negative (17N) mutants of Cdc42 and levels of p130Cas phosphorylation and Crk binding were determined in either the absence or presence of collagen stimulation. Transient expression of activated Cdc42(61L) resulted in a substantial increase in the level of p130Cas phosphorylation in the absence of collagen. Such an increase was not noted in cells expressing control vector or dominant negative Cdc42(17N) (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, the amount of Crk that could be co-immunoprecipitated with p130Cas was increased in unstimulated cells expressing activated Cdc42(61L) (Fig. 1E). Collagen stimulation further increased p130Cas phosphorylation and Crk binding in Cdc42(61L)-expressing cells. In cells expressing control vector or inactive Cdc42(17N), p130Cas phosphorylation, and Crk binding were induced only in response to collagen stimulation. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Cdc42 activation can stimulate p130Cas signaling. The Cdc42 Effector, Ack1, Mediates Cdc42 Effects on p130Cas Phosphorylation and Migration—Ack is the only known tyrosine kinase effector of Cdc42. To determine whether Ack1 mediated the effects of Cdc42 on p130Cas phosphorylation, cells were treated with Ack1 siRNA. siRNA reduced Ack1 expression levels in T47D cells by 50–80% but did not affect the expression of Ack2, or the unrelated tyrosine kinase, Src (Fig. 2A). p130Cas was immunoprecipitated from control and Cdc42(12V)-expressing cells treated with control or Ack1 siRNA, and phosphorylation on tyrosine determined. As already noted in Fig. 1B, Cdc42 activation induced p130Cas phosphorylation even in the absence of collagen (Fig. 2B). This effect was decreased in cells transfected with Ack1 siRNA, as compared with those treated with non-silencing control siRNA (Fig. 2B). Additionally, Ack1 siRNA also resulted in a decrease in collagen-driven p130Cas phosphorylation in control cells (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that Ack1 mediates Cdc42 signaling to p130Cas. To determine whether Ack1 was required for Cdc42-driven cell migration, control and Cdc42(12V)-expressing T47D cells were transiently transfected with siRNA to Ack1, or control siRNA, and migration across collagen-coated filters determined in a transwell assay. Cdc42(12V)-expressing cells exhibited a 3-fold increase in migration on collagen. Ack1 siRNA inhibited migration induced by Cdc42(12V) to baseline levels (Fig. 2C). Additionally, treatment with Ack1 siRNA also resulted in a small reduction in migration in control cells (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that Ack1 is required for Cdc42-induced migration. Cdc42, Ack1, p130Cas, and Crk Form a Collagen-regulated Signaling Complex—Because Cdc42 and Ack1 regulate p130Cas signaling, we wanted to know whether these proteins interact in cells. We were able to co-immunoprecipitate endogenous p130Cas and Cdc42 in T47D cells (Fig. 3A). This interaction was minimal in untreated cells and significantly enhanced upon collagen stimulation. We were also able to co-immunoprecipitate endogenous Ack1 with both p130Cas and its effector Crk (Fig. 3, B and C). In both cases there was a baseline level of interaction and an increase was observed with collagen stimulation. Expression of activated Cdc42(12V) appeared not to have an effect on these interactions, suggesting the formation of these complexes is regulated by additional pathways downstream of integrins. These results suggest that Ack1, Cdc42, and p130Cas are not only functionally linked, but also interact in a complex within cells. The Interaction of Ack1 and p130Cas Relies on SH3 and Proline-rich Domains—Interactions between a kinase and its substrate often rely partially on the catalytic domain of the kinase and the tyrosine phosphorylation motifs of the substrate. To determine whether the interaction between Ack1 and p130Cas was dependent on Ack1 kinase activity, p130Cas was immunoprecipitated from HEK cells transiently transfected with either wild-type or kinase-dead HA-Ack1, and the amount of co-precipitating Ack1 was determined by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody. A similar amount of wild-type and kinase-dead Ack1 co-immunoprecipitated with p130Cas, and in both cases the association was collagen-dependent (Fig. 4A), demonstrating that kinase activity is not required for the association of Ack1 with p130Cas. The substrate domain (SD) of p130Cas is its predominant phosphorylated domain. To determine whether the substrate domain is required for the interaction with Ack1, a p130Cas mutant in which the substrate domain has been deleted (p130CasΔSD) was overexpressed in HEK cells. p130CasΔSD could be co-immunoprecipitated with Ack1, but surprisingly this interaction was no longer regulated by collagen (Fig. 4B). Although, it was difficult to obtain equal expression levels of the p130CasΔSD, the amount that co-immunoprecipitated with Ack1 was always substantially increased compared with full-length p130Cas and p130CasΔSH3. Full-length p130Cas, as well as a mutant lacking the SH3 domain also bound to Ack1, and these interactions were still increased following collagen stimulation. Both Ack1 and p130Cas contain SH3 domains and proline-rich regions (Fig. 5A). To determine whether the interaction between p130Cas and Ack1 occurred through their SH3 domains, GST pull-down assays were performed. Ack1, p130Cas, Src, and both Crk SH3 domains were expressed as GST fusion proteins, purified and adjusted to equal concentrations (Fig. 5B). The Ack1 GST-SH3 domain was able to pull-down endogenous p130Cas (Fig. 5C). Similarly, the p130Cas GST-SH3 domain was able to pull-down Ack1 from lysates of cells expressing wild-type HA-Ack1, as determined by anti-HA blotting (Fig. 5D). Endogenous Ack1 could also be pulled down with the p130Cas SH3 domain (data not shown). To determine whether the SH3 domain of p130Cas was required for the interaction with Ack1, HEK cells were transfected with either full-length p130Cas or a p130Cas mutant in which the SH3 domain was deleted (p130CasΔSH3). Full-length p130Cas could be co-immunoprecipitated with Ack1 (Fig. 5E). This interaction was present in untreated cells and increased upon collagen stimulation. The amount of p130CasΔSH3 that co-immunoprecipitated with Ack1 was reduced in comparison to full-length p130Cas (Fig. 5E). In contrast to the p130CasΔSD, collagen regulation was maintained for p130CasΔSH3 (Figs. 5E and 4B), suggesting that collagen regulation of p130Cas/Ack interactions is not through the SH3 domain. The p130Cas Substrate Domain Is the Major Site of Ack1-dependent Phosphorylation—To determine whether Ack1-driven p130Cas phosphorylation depends on its SH3 or substrate domain, full-length p130Cas, p130CasΔSH3, and p130CasΔSD were co-transfected with either pEGFP vector or EGFP-Ack1 in HEK cells. Because overexpression of Ack1 results in increased phospho-Ack1 levels, 3P. J. Keely, unpublished data. EGFP tagging was necessary to increase the size of Ack1 and allow its separation from p130Cas. In cells expressing control EGFP vector, phosphorylation of p130Cas and p130CasΔSH3 was increased only upon collagen stimulation. In contrast, in cells expressing EGFP-Ack1, p130Cas, and p130CasΔSH3 phosphorylation levels were dramatically increased even in the absence of collagen stimulation (Fig. 6A). p130CasΔSH3 was phosphorylated to a lesser extent than that of full-length p130Cas (Fig. 6A, lower exposure). Importantly, p130CasΔSD was only minimally phosphorylated in Ack1-expressing cells (Fig. 6A, longer exposure). These results suggest that the major phosphorylation sites regulated by Ack1 lie within the substrate domain of p130Cas. To map phosphorylation sites in p130Cas, lysates of cells expressing p130Cas and either control vector (EGFP) or EGFP-Ack1 were immunoblotted with antibodies specific for tyrosine sites within the substrate domain of p130Cas: pY165, pY249, and pY410. Collagen induces phosphorylation of all three sites. Significantly, in cells expressing EGFP-Ack1, all three sites were phosphorylated to a much greater extent even in the absence of collagen (Fig. 6B), which suggests that Ack1 enhances phosphorylation of all three of these sites. Although Cdc42 has been demonstrated to regulate cell migration, a complete understanding of its various effector pathways has not been fully elucidated. We demonstrate a role for the Cdc42 effector, Ack1, in Cdc42-induced cell migration on collagen and in collagen-mediated signaling pathways. An intriguing finding is that collagen stimulation regulates the formation of a complex involving both Cdc42 and integrin signaling intermediates, because Ack1 as well as Cdc42 could be co-immunoprecipitated with p130Cas and its effector, Crk (Fig. 3). Interestingly, overexpressing activated Cdc42 in the absence of collagen stimulation was not sufficient to induce complex formation between Ack1 and p130Cas or Crk, demonstrating cooperative regulation of Cdc42 effector pathways by integrin signaling. This finding adds further support to the emerging notion of cross-regulation between integrins and small GTPases. Ack1 and p130Cas interact in unstimulated cells and their binding is enhanced upon collagen stimulation (Figs. 3 and 5). The SH3 domains of both Ack1 and p130Cas were involved in facilitating this interaction (Fig. 5). It is interesting that the deletion of the SH3 domain in p130Cas significantly decreased its interaction with Ack1 in unstimulated cells, but collagen stimulation was still able to drive binding (Fig. 6). This suggests that the collagen-induced interaction lies elsewhere, such as within the substrate domain of p130Cas, which becomes heavily phosphorylated on multiple tyrosines following integrin engagement. In fact, similar levels of p130CasΔSD (p130Cas in which the substrate domain was deleted) can be co-immunoprecipitated with Ack1 in the presence or absence of collagen (Fig. 4). Surprisingly, the amount of p130CasΔSD co-immunoprecipitated with Ack1 appeared enhanced in comparison to full-length p130Cas. One conclusion from this may be that the substrate domain does drive complex formation in the presence of collagen, but actually inhibits constitutive SH3-driven Ack1 binding to p130Cas. Because the substrate domain constitutes nearly a third of the molecule, it may block access to the SH3 domain through intramolecular interactions and diminish the binding of proline-rich molecules, such as Ack1. Phosphorylation of the substrate domain may release this inhibition and allow additional binding of Ack-1 to the SH3 domain. The substrate domain of p130Cas is a region where many other proteins also bind to p130Cas, and in its absence, molecules that interact through the SH3 domain and the proline-rich region, including Ack1, may be able to bind more freely. Crk was also a component of this complex, and there are several potential ways it can interact. Crk binds to the phosphorylated substrate domain of p130Cas (37Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). We suspect that the interaction of Crk with Ack1 occurs most likely through p130Cas. However, because Ack1 is also phosphorylated upon collagen treatment3 it is possible that Crk binds via its SH2 domain not only to phosphorylated p130Cas but also to Ack1 directly. Additional binding studies are needed to investigate this possibility. Ack1 not only associated with p130Cas but also induced its phosphorylation. These results are consistent with recent findings that Ack1 can interact with p130Cas and lead to its phosphorylation in response to laminin stimulation (30van der Degenhardt Y.Y. Horst E.H. Strelow A. Slavin A. Chinn L. Orf J. Rong M. Li S. See L.H. Nguyen K.Q. Hoey T. Wesche H. Powers S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15901-15906Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and that Ack1 is required for melanoma chondroitin sulfate-induced p130Cas phosphorylation (24Eisenmann K.M. McCarthy J.B. Simpson M.A. Keely P.J. Guan J.L. Tachibana K. Lim L. Manser E. Furcht L.T. Iida J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Both full-length and p130CasΔSH3 were hyperphosphorylated in HEK cells overexpressing Ack1 under conditions in which Ack1 and p130Cas were also associated (Fig. 6). This suggests that the interaction between Ack1 and p130Cas drives the phosphorylation and suggests that p130Cas may be a direct substrate for Ack1. Interestingly, there was only a slight enhancement in phosphorylation of p130CasΔSD in cells overexpressing Ack1, although its binding to Ack1 was not impaired. These results suggest that the major Ack-1-dependent phosphorylation site(s) lie within the substrate domain of p130Cas. In fact, the phosphorylation of three sites within the substrate domain was enhanced in cells expressing Ack1: pTyr165, pTyr249, and pTyr410 (Fig. 6). Whereas Src has been shown to phosphorylate sites 249 and 410, tyrosine 165 is thought to be a minor site of Src activity (44Shin N.Y. Dise R.S. Schneider-Mergener J. Ritchie M.D. Kilkenny D.M. Hanks S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38331-38337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Cells expressing Ack1 exhibited a substantial increase in phosphorylation of site 165 in addition to tyrosine 249 and 410. Phosphorylation on tyrosines 249 and 410 creates binding sites for the Crk SH2 domain, whereas site 165 does not interact with Crk (44Shin N.Y. Dise R.S. Schneider-Mergener J. Ritchie M.D. Kilkenny D.M. Hanks S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38331-38337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Therefore, enhanced phosphorylation at Tyr249 and Tyr410 in p130Cas is consistent with enhanced binding of p130Cas to Crk, and subsequent enhanced cell migration. One possibility is that Ack1 leads to phosphorylation on some p130Cas tyrosines through Src, thus leading to increased Crk binding. In addition, Ack1 may phosphorylate sites independently of Src and create binding sites for additional SH2-containing molecules. Alternatively, Ack1 may be able to phosphorylate all three sites directly and subsequently lead to association with different downstream effectors. To rule out the role of Src, we considered using PP2 inhibitors in our phosphorylation studies, but determined that data from such experiments would not be conclusive because Src family members are also required for Ack1 activation (17Yokoyama N. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47713-47723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 21Linseman D.A. Heidenreich K.A. Fisher S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5622-5628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This is a similar situation to focal adhesion kinase (FAK), whose kinase activity is activated by Src, making it difficult to discern whether it contributes to the phosphorylation of other proteins directly or by scaffolding with Src. We propose that Ack1 is the kinase that mediates p130Cas phosphorylation in Cdc42(12V)-expressing cells. In these cells, Ack1 would be predicted to exhibit enhanced kinase activity and could potentially phosphorylate p130Cas and prompt Crk binding, even in the absence of collagen stimulation. In control cells, on the other hand, collagen may be required to activate Cdc42 and in turn activate Ack1. In both control and Cdc42-expressing cells, Ack1 is phosphorylated in response to collagen stimulation (data not shown), which should result in further activation of the Ack1-p130Cas pathway. Collagen stimulation can also lead to p130Cas phosphorylation by other kinases, which could result in a multi-armed stimulation downstream of collagen receptors. Thus far, Src has been the major kinase thought to be responsible for p130Cas phosphorylation. Interestingly, Cdc42(12V)-expressing cells exhibit lower levels of Src expression in comparison with control T47D cells (data not shown). It is possible that in cells expressing activated Cdc42(12V), Ack1 takes over as the major kinase responsible for phosphorylation of p130Cas (and possibly other substrates), and Src levels are diminished. It is increasingly clear that Rho GTPases play an important role in integrin signaling pathways. Cdc42 can be activated upon integrin engagement with extracellular matrix components (45Schwartz M.A. Shattil S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 388-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). We also see Cdc42 activation upon collagen treatment and direct β1 integrin stimulation (data not shown). It is still unclear how Cdc42 becomes activated downstream of integrin activation. One way this can occur is through a recently identified exchange factor PIX. αPIX can be recruited to integrin complexes by associating with β-parvin-ILK complex and lead to activation of both Cdc42 and Rac at sites of integrin clustering (46Mishima W. Suzuki A. Yamaji S. Yoshimi R. Ueda A. Kaneko T. Tanaka J. Miwa Y. Ohno S. Ishigatsubo Y. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 47Rosenberger G. Kutsche K. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 85: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, Cdc42 is a key component of integrin signaling pathways leading to cell migration. A substantial body of evidence suggests a crucial role for p130Cas in the process of cell migration (12Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Tan L. Lim L. Nature. 1993; 363: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 14Bourdoulous S. Orend G. MacKenna D.A. Pasqualini R. Ruoslahti E. J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 47713-47723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We found that migration induced by Cdc42 activation also relied on p130Cas, because this migration could be inhibited by p130Cas siRNA (Fig. 1). We think that the requirement for p130Cas downstream of Cdc42 goes beyond a simple obligate need for this molecule during cell migration, because Cdc42 and p130Cas associated in response to collagen (Fig. 3), and because Cdc42 activation enhanced p130Cas signaling (Fig. 2). Our results suggest that p130Cas and Cdc42 are intimately linked. In our hands, the effect of Cdc42 on integrin signaling to p130Cas is not caused by enhanced adhesion, focal contact formation, or changes in cell shape, because our results were obtained by stimulating cells in suspension with collagen fibers. Although we see striking signaling changes in cells stimulated for relatively short times, we believe these signaling events are relevant to cell migration, which we observe over several hours. Because migration is a dynamic process, multiple short term signaling events at the leading edge of the cell are likely to regulate cell migration. Importantly, we have directly linked two signaling components to cell migration, because both Ack1 and p130Cas siRNA decreased Cdc42-induced migration. Although the precise function for Ack1 in cells is not yet clear, it is becoming apparent that it is involved in several signaling pathways that regulate tumor formation and metastasis (29Mahajan N.P. Whang Y.E. Mohler J.L. Earp H.S. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10514-10523Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 30van der Degenhardt Y.Y. Horst E.H. Strelow A. Slavin A. Chinn L. Orf J. Rong M. Li S.

We also find that Ack1 plays a role in cell migration, which is consistent with results obtained by van der Horst et al. (30van der Degenhardt Y.Y. Horst E.H. Strelow A. Slavin A. Chinn L. Orf J. Rong M. Li S. See L.H. Nguyen K.Q. Hoey T. Wesche H. Powers S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15901-15906Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) who found that overexpression of Ack1 in cancer cell lines promoted a more invasive phenotype in vitro and in vivo. Our results are also consistent with those reported for Ack2; because overexpression of Ack2 results in increased migration of HeLa cells (25Coon M. Herrera R. J. Cell Biochem. 2002; 84: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Interestingly, most Ack1 effects on cell migration have been observed in highly migratory cell lines. In our hands, Ack1 siRNA also had a more potent effect on the more migratory Cdc42(12V)-expressing T47D cells. This may suggest that Ack1 could be a good target for cancer-specific drug therapy.

Voltage-dependent calcium channels are membrane-bound proteins that form large aqueous pores for the selective diffusion of Ca2+ ions across the plasma membrane (1Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Native Ca2+ channels are composed of the pore-forming CaVα1, the disulfur-linked dimer CaVα2δ, the intracellular CaVβ subunits (β1-β4), and in some cases the CaVγ subunit (3Arikkath J. Campbell K.P.

Whereas all voltage-gated Ca2+ channel α1 subunits activate and inactivate in response to membrane depolarization, the high voltage-activated (HVA) 2The abbreviations used are: HVA, high voltage-activated; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; VDI, voltage-dependent inactivation; TM, transmembrane; CDI, calcium-dependent inactivation. 2The abbreviations used are: HVA, high voltage-activated; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; VDI, voltage-dependent inactivation; TM, transmembrane; CDI, calcium-dependent inactivation. CaV1 and CaV2 α1 subunits operate at markedly more positive membrane potentials than low voltage-activated CaV3 channel α1 subunits. In the absence of a crystal structure for these proteins, details regarding the structural determinants of the channel inner pore as well as the molecular mechanism underlying the activation of CaVα1 subunits remain sketchy. Structural studies have revealed that the architecture of the ion-selective pore is conserved in the homologous α subunit of different K+ channels (10Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A.

Activation of voltage-gated K channels appears to involve the PXP locus (where X represents a hydrophobic residue) motif that is highly conserved in the lower part of S6 (16Webster S.M. Del Camino D.

Prolines tend to destabilize α-helices by the lack of a backbone hydrogen bond, normally formed by the amide nitrogen and by steric constraints (19Blaber M. Zhang X.J. Matthews B.W.

Due to their typical ϕ-Ψ bond angles, proline residues bend by at least 20° the axis of the α-helix. Based on the molecular properties of the residues, the PXP motif was thus proposed to form a “hinge” structure in voltage-gated K+ channels (16Webster S.M. Del Camino D. Dekker J.P. Yellen G.

In contrast, the crystal structure of a Ca2+-gated K+ channel (MthK) obtained in the presence of bound Ca2+ showed that the pore-lining helices are bent about 30° near Gly83 such that the helical bundle is splayed open (11Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). The closed KcsA structure, where the inner helices adopt an “inverted teepee” conformation crossing over near the intracellular surface at the helix bundle, would represent the closed state (10Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5649) Google Scholar). Based on these static crystal structures, it was proposed that K+ channels could open by bending the pore-lining α-helix at this nearly universal glycine residue located in the middle of the pore lining helix (23Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). The comparison of backbone torsions was, however, limited by the poor resolution of the x-ray structure of MthK. Furthermore, the significance of this proposed gating mechanism (23Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar) remains unclear, especially for eukaryotic ion channels. HVA CaV1 and CaV2 channels possess four distinct S6 segments, but none possesses the tandem PXP motif that has been implicated in the activation gating of KV channels. In addition, the “universal” glycine residue is conserved only in two of the four inner helices in HVA CaV1 and CaV2 channels (Fig. 1B). Instead, a triglycine motif, GX9GX3G, has been identified in IS6 of all HVA CaV1 and CaV2 channels, whereas a lone but strictly conserved Gly residue can be found in mid-IIS6. The distal GX3G motif is reminiscent of the biglycine GXXXG or GX3G motif that provides a framework for specific transmembrane helix-helix and dimerization interactions (24Brosig B. Langosch D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1052-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 25Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar, 26Senes A.

The proximal GX9G motif is similar to the biglycine GX8G motif conserved in TM2 of most Kir channels (13Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Antcliff J.F. Rahman T. Lowe E.D. Zimmer J. Cuthbertson J. Ashcroft F.M. Ezaki T. Doyle D.A. Science. 2003; 300: 1922-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). In this regard, the second proline of the PXP motif is located at the position that corresponds approximately to the second glycine (Fig. 1B), suggesting that this glycine could be pivotal in channel gating. Finally, mutations of the distal glycine GX3G residues to polar serine and arginine residues in the human CaV1.2 contributes to the Timothy syndrome, characterized by lethal arrhythmias (29Splawski I.

Herein, we show that relatively conserved alanine mutations of any glycine residue in IS6 significantly decreased macroscopic kinetics, with stronger effects observed with mutations of the second glycine in GX9GX3G of CaV1.2. In CaV2.3, mutation of the distal GX3G residue impacted significantly on the inactivation gating. It is proposed that the GX3G residues play a pivotal role in the gating of HVA CaV channels, with the distal glycine residue being mostly involved in the inactivation gating.

Constructs were verified by restriction mapping after religation of the mutated fragment into the SacI/XhoI sites of the wild-type CaV1.2. Recombinant clones for CaV1.2 and CaV2.3 were screened by double-stranded sequence analysis of the entire ligated cassette. The cDNA coding for the human camodulin (CaM) clone (GenBank™ M27319) was obtained by reverse-transcribing human placenta poly(A)+ RNA (Clontech). The cDNA was then amplified using the SMART PCR cDNA synthesis kit (Clontech) using specific primers designed to subclone into the restriction sites of the pT7TS vector (generously provided by Dr. Paul A. Krieg, University of Arizona). The pT7TS vector contains the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of Xenopus laevis β-globin mRNA inserted into pGEM-4Z. The CaM1234 mutant (D20A/D56A/D93A/D129A) was obtained with the QuikChange XL mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA constructs for the CaV1.2 and CaV2.3 subunits (wild type and mutants) were linearized at the 3′-end by HindIII digestion. The rat brain CaVβ3 subunit, the CaVα2bδ, and the human CaM were digested by NotI, EcoRI, and BamHI, respectively. Run-off transcripts were prepared using methylated cap analog m7G (5′)ppp(5′)G and T7 RNA polymerase with the mMessage mMachine® transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). The final cRNA products were resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated H2O and stored at -20 °C. The integrity of the final product and the absence of degraded RNA were determined by a denaturing agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. Functional Expression of Wild-type and Mutant Channels— Oocytes were obtained from female Xenopus laevis clawed frog (Nasco, Fort Atkinson, WI) as described previously (34Dafi O. Dodier Y. Berrou L.

Individual oocytes free of follicular cells were obtained after a 30-40-min incubation in a calcium-free solution: 82.5 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, containing 2 mg/ml collagenase (Invitrogen). 46 nl of a solution containing between 35 and 50 ng of cRNA coding for the wild-type or mutated CaVα1 subunit was injected 16 h later into stage V and VI oocytes. cRNA coding for the CaVα1 subunit was coinjected with the rat brain CaVα2bδ and the rat brain CaVβ3 subunit at a 3:1:2 weight ratio, respectively. In some experiments, 27.6-55.2 ng of cRNA coding for the calmodulin wild-type or the CaM1234 mutant was co-injected with the channel subunits. For these experiments, CaM was sometimes injected 24-48 h before the CaV subunits with the same results. Oocytes were incubated at 18 °C in a Barth's solution: 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm pyruvic acid, 100 mm units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, pH 7.6. The biophysical properties of each mutant were studied in a minimum of three different oocyte batches. Furthermore, the control channel was tested periodically over time and measured in the same oocyte batch as the mutants, thus ensuring that the channel properties were recorded under the same level of endogenous CaVβ subunits (38Lacerda A.E.

Western Blots—Western blots were performed on both total membranes and purified plasma membranes isolated from X. laevis oocytes as detailed elsewhere (40Leduc-Nadeau A. Lahjouji K. Bissonnette P. Lapointe J.-Y. Bichet D.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar). Briefly, homogenates prepared from six oocytes were centrifuged at 250 × g at 4 °C to discard cell debris. Supernatants were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min to pellet down total membranes. Total membranes were resuspended in a saline solution and frozen until use. For preparations enriched in plasma membranes, 40 oocytes were rinsed in MBSS (80 mm NaCl, 20 mm MES, pH 6.0) and incubated at room temperature with 0.005% subtilisin A (Sigma) to partially digest the vitelline membrane. Polymerization of plasma membranes was performed by two sequential 60-min incubations in MBSS first with 1% Ludox and then with 0.1% polyacrylic acid (Sigma). The oocytes were then homogenized in cold HbA (5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, 80 mm sucrose, and 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, with a protease inhibitor mixture. The homogenates centrifuged twice at 16 × g for 30 s at 4 °C and then at 25 × g and finally at 35 × g. A final centrifugation step at 16,000 × g for 20 min is used to pellet the purified plasma membranes, which are resuspended in 10 μl of HbA and frozen until use. Proteins were analyzed using the primary antibody against CaV1.2 (dilution 1:200; Alomone Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel) and the secondary anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase antibody. The quality of the overall procedure was monitored by Ponceau red staining. Electrophysiological Recordings in Oocytes—Wild-type and mutant channels were screened at room temperature for macroscopic Ba2+ currents 2-6 days after RNA injection using a two-electrode voltage clamp amplifier (OC-725C; Warner Instruments) as described earlier (34Dafi O.

Whole-cell currents were measured in a 10 mm Ba2+ solution (10 mm Ba(OH)2, 110 mm NaOH, 1 mm KOH, 20 mm Hepes titrated to pH 7.3 with methane sulfonic acid or occasionally in a 10 mm Ca2+ solution, where Ca(OH)2 replaced Ba(OH)2. To minimize kinetic contamination by the endogenous Ca2+-activated Cl- current, oocytes were injected with 18.4 nl of a 50 mm EGTA (Sigma) 0.5-2 h before the experiments (41Parent L. Gopalakrishnan M. Lacerda A.E. Wei X. Perez-Reyes E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Oocytes were superfused by gravity flow at a rate of 2 ml/min that was fast enough to allow complete chamber fluid exchange within 30 s. Experiments were performed at room temperature (20-22 °C). Data Acquisition and Analysis—PClamp software 8.2 (Molecular Devices, Axon instruments, Foster City, CA) was used for on-line data acquisition and analysis. Unless stated otherwise, data were sampled at 10 kHz and low pass-filtered at 5 kHz using the amplifier built-in filter. For CaV1.2, a series of 900-ms voltage pulses were applied from a holding potential of -100 mV at a frequency of 0.2 Hz from -40 to +50 mV, whereas the voltage pulses were 450 ms long for CaV2.3. Activation parameters were estimated from the mean I-V curves obtained for each channel combination. The I-V relationships were normalized to the maximum amplitude and were fitted to the Boltzmann Equation 1, iimax=Grel(Vm-Vrev)1+exp-zFRT(Vm-E0.5,act)(Eq. 1) where E0.5 represents the potential for 50% activation, z is the slope parameter, Vm is the test potential, and RT/F have their usual meanings. The fitting process generated an estimation of the error associated with the fit of each of the adjustable parameters. For statistical analysis, however, the experimental errors were estimated by calculating the individual E0.5 act for each I-V curve and extracting the S.E. from the mean of individual E0.5 act. For CaV1.2 that is slowly inactivating, inactivation kinetics were quantified using r800 values (i.e. the ratio of the whole-cell current remaining at the end of an 800-ms pulse). For CaV2.3 that is inactivating slightly faster, inactivation kinetics were quantified using r300 values (i.e. the ratio of the whole-cell current remaining at the end of a 300-ms pulse). For the CaV1.2 mutant channels that did not display significant inactivation during the depolarizing pulse (r800 > 0.98), macroscopic kinetics were characterized by the “time to peak” parameter that was extracted directly from the work-sheet generated with Clampfit 8.2. Unless specified otherwise, r800 and time to peak values were calculated at -10 < Vm < 30 mV but reported in the text at Vm = +10 mV. Capacitive transients were erased for clarity in the final figures. In a few experiments, the voltage dependence of inactivation (isochronal inactivation) were obtained from normalized currents measured at 0 or +10 mV after a series of 5-s prepulses that varied from -100 to +30 mV at a frequency of 0.02 Hz (34Dafi O. Dodier Y. Berrou L. Raybaud A. Sauve R. Parent L. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 3181-3192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For the isochronal inactivation figures, data points represent the mean of n ≥ 4 and were fitted to a Boltzmann equation as described elsewhere (37Berrou L. Dodier Y. Raybaud A. Tousignant A. Dafi O. Pelletier J.N. Parent L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 494-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Time constants of whole-cell current traces were estimated with the predefined Equation 2 in Clampfit 8.2 that uses the Chebyshev routine and a 4-point smoothing filter with n = 2 for Ba2+ current traces and n = 3 for Ca2+ current traces. Under the latter, time constant 1 (τ1) was defined as the slow inactivation time constant, and time constant 2 (τ2) was the fast inactivation time constant. The activation time constant is τ3. f(t)=∑i=1nAie-t/τi+C(Eq. 2) Statistical analyses were performed using the one-way analysis of variance (Tukey test) for two independent populations fitting routines provided by Origin 7.0. Data were considered statistically significant for p < 0.01. Computer-predicted Structure and Homology Modeling of IS6 in CaV1.2 and CaV2.3—The sequence alignments of the CaV channels with the KV1.2 channel and the MthK channel were based upon the universal glycine located on the S6 segment. Automated homology modeling was performed with INSIGHTII module Modeler version 8.2 (42Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10294) Google Scholar) and involved the generation of 150 monomer models for >120 residues from S5 to S6 in both CaV1.2 and CaV2.3 channels using either KV1.2 (Protein Data Bank 2A79) (15Long S.B. Campbell E.B. MacKinnon R. Science. 2005; 309: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1811) Google Scholar), KcsA (Protein Data Bank 1K4C) (14Zhou Y. Morais-Cabral J.H. Kaufman A. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2001; 414: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar), or MthK (Protein Data Bank 1LNQ) channel as templates. SAMT02 (43Karplus K. Karchin R. Draper J. Casper J. Mandel-Gutfreund Y. Diekhans M. Hughey R. Proteins. 2003; 53: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) was used to determine the CaV residues composing the pore helix, the selectivity filter, and S6. The external loop between the selectivity filter and S6 is slightly longer in CaV than in K+ channels, thus justifying the introduction of gaps in the templates. In the resulting model, the high affinity Ca2+ binding site (Glu393 in CaV1.2) is equivalent to the high affinity ion binding site S4 in the crystallized KcsA channel (44Morais-Cabral J.H. Zhou Y. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2001; 414: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). The models with the lowest objective function (roughly related to the energy of the model) and the lowest root mean square deviation for S6 between the template and the model were kept. The precision of the models decreased significantly for the residues located at the C-terminal end in the absence of structural constraints. Energy minimization was carried out with CHARMM as described elsewhere (45Simoes M. Garneau L. Klein H. Banderali U. Hobeila F. Roux B. Parent L. Sauve R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 99-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 46Dodier Y. Banderali U. Klein H. Topalak O. Dafi O. Simoes M. Bernatchez G. Sauve R. Parent L. J. Biol.

The Three Glycine Residues in IS6 Are Involved in Voltage-dependent Gating of CaV1.2—High voltage-activated CaV1.2 and CaV2.3 channels possess three Gly residues in IS6 (GX9GX3G) and one Gly residue in mid-IIS6. Glycine residues are unique in their ability to adopt a wide range of main chain dihedral angles. When projected on a helicoidal wheel (Fig. 1A), Gly422, Gly432, and Gly436 are found to line the same side of the helix in CaV1.2, suggesting that they could act in concert. No Gly or Pro residues are present in IIIS6 and IVS6. Since Gly422 in IS6 and Gly770 in IIS6 could be aligned with the hinge Gly83 in MthK (23Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R.

However, the molecular mechanisms for ERK1/2 activation by PTH remain unclear. By using a targeted mutagenesis approach, we investigated the PTH/PTH-related protein receptor (PTH1R) structural determinants for ERK1/2 activation and transcriptional activity in HEK-293 cells. First, ERK1/2 activation was inhibited by PTH1R mutations that specifically abrogate Gq-protein kinase C signaling without a decrease in cAMP-protein kinase A. Second, PTH1R C-terminal mutations and/or deletions that prevent interaction with β-arrestin inhibited ERK1/2 activation. Similar results were obtained in HEK-293 cells co-expressing wild-type PTH1R and a dominant-negative β-arrestin2. Third, the c-Src inhibitor PP2 and a kinasedead c-SrcK295M mutant co-expressed with wild-type PTH1R both inhibited ERK1/2 activation. Furthermore, c-Src co-precipitated with both PTH1R andβ-arrestin2 in response to PTH. Deleting the PTH1R-proximal C terminus abolished these interactions. However, the need for receptor interaction with β-arrestin to co-precipitate Src and activate ERK1/2 was obviated by expressing a constitutively active c-SrcY527A mutant, suggesting direct binding of activated Src to PTH1R. Subsequently, we identified and mutated to alanine four proline-rich motifs in the PTH1R distal C terminus, which resulted in loss of both c-Src and arrestin co-precipitation and significantly decreased ERK1/2 activation. These data delineate the multiple PTH1R structural determinants for ERK1/2 activation and newly identify a unique mechanism involving proline-rich motifs in the receptor C terminus for reciprocal scaffolding of c-Src and β-arrestin2 with a class II G-protein-coupled receptor.

Robinson F. Beers Gibson T. Xu B.E. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3564) Google Scholar). Recent studies on the β2-adrenergic receptor and the angiotensin type 1A receptor showed that ERK1/2 could be independently activated by the classical Gs and Gq signaling cascades and/or through receptor internalization with β-arrestins (2Shenoy S.K. Lefkowitz R.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 503-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 4Azzi M. Charest P.G. Angers S. Rousseau G. Kohout T. Bouvier M. Pineyro G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition to uncoupling GPCRs from heterotrimeric G proteins and activating phosphodiesterase 4, thereby prompting cessation of cAMP signaling (6Attramadal H. Arriza J.L. Aoki C. Dawson T.M.

Alternatively, some GPCRs, such as the β3-adrenergic receptor, are capable of binding c-Src directly in the absence of β-arrestin (12Cao W. Luttrell L.M. Medvedev A.V. Pierce K.L. Daniel K.W.

This scaffold is made possible through protein-protein interactions, including Src homology 3 (SH3) domains in c-Src and proline-rich motifs (PXXP) in the β3-adrenergic receptor. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is the primary regulator of serum calcium homeostasis and plays a major role in bone metabolism (13Fitzpatrick L.A. Bilezikian J.P. Bilezikian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, San Diego1996: 339-346Google Scholar). In osteoblasts and kidney cells, i.e. classical targets for PTH, PTH-induced ERK1/2 activation is correlated with cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (14Turner P.R. Mefford S.

The PTH/PTHrP receptor (type 1 parathyroid hormone receptor, PTH1R) is a class II GPCR that transduces PTH (and PTHrP) signaling mainly through Gs and Gq proteins (18Abou-Samra A.B. Juppner H.

The termination of receptor signaling involves receptor phosphorylation by PKC, GRKs, and to a lesser extent, PKA (20Blind E. Bambino T. Nissenson R.A.

Accordingly, PTH has been reported to activate ERK1/2 through arrestin-mediated internalization of PTH1R and subsequent transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (25Syme C.A. Friedman P.A. Bisello A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11281-11288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Moreover, it was recently shown that Gβγ subunit interaction with the juxta-membrane region of the PTH1R cytoplasmic tail is implicated in MAPK signaling (26Mahon M.J. Bonacci T.M. Divieti P. Smrcka A.V. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 136-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, most of the PTH1R structural determinants and related molecular events implicated in ERK1/2 activation remain to be elucidated. By using an extensive mutagenesis approach, we now identify a unique mechanism for ERK1/2 activation by PTH that engages scaffolding of c-Src through both proline-rich motifs and β-arrestin-binding sites in the PTH1R C terminus. In turn, direct binding of c-Src to the receptor stabilizes its interaction with arrestins and may ensure a molecular switch from cAMP/IP3 intracellular signaling to MAPK signaling cascades. Adenylyl Cyclase Activity—cAMP accumulation was determined in subconfluent cell cultures in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine as described previously (23Ferrari S.L. Bisello A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 149-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated for 2 h in medium containing [3H]adenine (2 μCi/ml), then preincubated for 15 min with 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (1 mm), and subsequently exposed to PTH-(1–34) (100 nm) for the indicated time. In all cases, reactions were stopped with 1.2 m trichloroacetic acid, and cAMP was isolated by the two-column chromatographic method as described previously (23Ferrari S.L. Bisello A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 149-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Accumulation of [3H]adenine was then determined by a standard liquid scintillation technique. Results were expressed in percentage of WT PTH1R, and EC50 values were determined by performing PTH dose response for each mutant receptor (Fig. 1). Materials—Bovine parathyroid hormone fragment 1–34 (PTH-(1–34)) and forskolin were purchased from Sigma. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was from Invitrogen. c-Src inhibitor (PP2), PKA inhibitor (H89), and PKC inhibitor (Gö6983) were obtained from Calbiochem. Anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (pERK1/2) rabbit polyclonal antibody, antiphosphotyrosine 416 c-Src, and anti-His tag (27E8) mouse monoclonal antibodies were from Cell Signaling (Allschwill, Switzerland). Mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (JL-8) was purchased from BD Biosciences. Protein A/G Plus immunoprecipitation reagent, anti-p44/p42 MAPK (ERK1/2), and anti-c-Src (Src-2) rabbit polyclonal antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Nunningen, Switzerland). Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) in a humidified 5% CO2 air incubator at 37 °C. Cells were plated at 9 × 105 cells/flask in 25-cm2 cell culture flasks (Corning Glass) for MAPK assays and co-immunoprecipitation or at 105 cells/well in 24-well dishes (Corning Glass) for luciferase assay, transfected as described previously (23Ferrari S.L.

PathDetect Reporting System—The SRE signal transduction pathways were assayed in vitro using the PathDetect SRE cis-reporting system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Briefly, 24-well tissue culture plates were seeded at a density of 105 cells/well in 0.5 ml of complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and transfected using FuGENE® reagent (Roche Applied Science) 24 h after plating, with 400 ng of pSRE-reporter and various amounts of plasmid DNA to be tested. As needed, empty pcDNA3.1 vector was added to make the total transfected DNA amount equal in all wells. As an appropriate control for transfection efficiency, plasmid pRLTK coding for Renilla luciferase was also transfected using 10 ng/well. One night before PTH treatment, the medium was replaced by 1% FCS medium. The reporter luciferase activity was assayed by cell lysis and quantitation on a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner BioSystems, Sunnyvale, CA) using the luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Results were expressed in PTH fold induction of luciferase activity. Plasmids Constructions—Cloning, ligations, transformations in E. coli XL1 blue strain, and DNA mini preparations were carried out according to Sambrook et al. (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was prepared using Qiagen kits (Basel, Switzerland). PCRs were performed using Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science). The temperature cycling protocol was 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 2 min for 30 cycles. The reactions were concluded by a 10-min elongation at 72 °C. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Microsynth AG (Balgach, Switzerland). Human PTH1R was cloned in pZeoSV2(+) (Invitrogen) as described in Bisello et al. (28Bisello A. Manen D. Pierroz D.D. Usdin T.B. Rizzoli R. Ferrari S.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1486-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). All subsequent mutants of the receptor were derived from this plasmid. Trun-cated PTH1R receptor at aa 500 was first constructed using PCR amplification as described previously (7Ferrari S.L. Behar V. Chorev M. Rosenblatt M. Bisello A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29968-29975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and the appropriate mutations were thereafter added to obtain the β-arrestin-deficient PTH1R mutant (see below). The proximal C terminus-deficient PTH1R mutant (PCdel-PTH1R) holding a deletion of 28 amino acids between aa 472 and 500 has been created by PCR amplification of the DNA fragments located upstream and downstream of the sequence to be removed, using two sets of primers. H223R mutant was a generous gift of Dr. H. Juppner (Boston). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using QuickChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Basel, Switzerland) and the appropriate oligonucleotide primers and following the recommendations of the manufacturer. DNA sequence analysis of each construct confirmed the absence of PCR-introduced mutations. The β-arrestin-deficient PTH1R (ArD-PTH1R) results in the replacements of 7 proximal serine residues in the cytoplasmic tail of the trun-cated PTH1R at aa 500 with alanine (Ser-473, Ser-475, Ser-489, Ser-491, Ser-492, Ser-493, and Ser-495). The Gq-deficient PTH1R mutant (GqD-PTH1R) was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis and resulted in the change of EKKY motif into DSEL amino acid sequence within the second intracellular loop (29Iida-Klein A. Guo J. Takemura M. Drake M.T. Potts Jr., J.T. Abou-Samra A. Bringhurst F.R. Segre G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6882-6889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The proline-rich motifs-deficient PTH1R mutant (PrD-PTH1R) resulted in the replacement of prolines (Pro-517, Pro-520, Pro-532, Pro-535, Pro-540, Pro-543, Pro-578, and Pro-581) by alanines in the four proline-rich motifs (PXXP) located in PTH1R C terminus. The resulting mutated proteins encoded by these plasmids are described in Fig. 1. All receptors used for immunoprecipitation were subcloned in the pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO vector in-frame with V5 epitope (Invitrogen). The plasmid-encoding rat β-arrestin2-GFP was described by Ferrari and Bisello (23Ferrari S.L. Bisello A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 149-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The β-arrestin2 minigene (AA284–409), containing the major clathrin binding domain, was constructed by amplification of the 3′ end of the cDNA. The 5′ forward primer was designed, including a consensus Kozak sequence, an initial methionine ATG codon followed by the GCA glycine codon, and a 3′ reverse primer encoded the last 7 amino acids without a stop codon (30Orsini M.J. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34616-34622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). PCR was performed on the plasmid encoding rat β-arrestins. The PCR fragments were cloned in the pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO vector. We selected the clones in which the insert had the correct orientation, in-frame with the V5 epitope (Invitrogen). c-Src, kinase-dead c-Src-K295M (SrcK–) and constitutively active c-Src-Y527A (SrcK+) (31Abram C.L. Courtneidge S.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) were the generous gifts of Dr. Marc Chanson (Geneva, Switzerland). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—HEK-293 cells treated with PTH were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until used for analysis. Cells were lysed at 4 °C in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm Na3VO4, 0.01 μm calyculin A, 0.1 μm microcystin LR, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS for 60 min. Lysates were then cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min, and a 75-μl sample was diluted with an equal volume of 2× reducing sample buffer containing 125 mm Tris buffer (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 200 mm dithiothreitol. The mixture was then heated at 70 °C for 30 min and subjected to gel electrophoresis on 6–15% gels. Following SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes and immunoblotted with either anti-pERK1/2 (1:10,000) or anti-ERK1/2 (1:20,000) antibodies. Detection was performed using peroxidase-coupled specific secondary antibody, enhanced chemiluminescence reaction, and visualization by autoradiography (Amersham Biosciences). Evaluation of p-ERK1/2 quantification was made using the IQMac version 1.2 software. For immunoprecipitation analysis, equal aliquots of protein lysates were immunoprecipitated using 2 μg of specific antibody (anti-His6 or anti-GFP) and incubated overnight at 4 °C in a rotating device. After 24 h, 20 μl of protein A/G Plus-agarose were added and incubated for 1 h at 4°C. Immunoprecipitates were then collected by centrifugation at 1200 × g for 3 min, and pellets were washed four times with lysis buffer and resuspended in 50 μl of running buffer. Aliquots were then subjected to electrophoresis as described above, and membranes were immunoblotted with either anti-c-Src, anti-phosphotyrosine(416)-c-Src, anti-GFP or anti-His Tag antibodies. Immunoblots were probed with peroxidase-coupled specific secondary antibodies and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Fluorescence Microscopy—To perform real time fluorescence microscopy, HEK-293 cells were plated on 25-mm glass coverslips (1.5 × 105 cells/coverslip) and culture for 48 h. After 24 h of culture, they were co-transfected with either PTH1R, PCdel-PTH1R, ArD-PTH1R or PrD-PTH1R and with β-arrestin2-GFP associated with or without dn β-arrestin2. 24 h after transfection, coverslips were washed twice with 1 ml of PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and the cell chamber was placed at 37 °C in a temperature-controlled block for the duration of the experiment. Effects of PTH-(1–34) (100 nm) on β-arrestin2-GFP localization was evaluated by adding the agonist in the same buffer and by monitoring redistribution of the green fluorescent protein at 0, 5, and 20 min. Coverslips were analyzed with a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope with a 100× oil immersion objective (Carl Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany). Statistics—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. (n), where n indicates the number of independent experiments performed in triplicate. Statistical analyses were performed by two-factor analysis of variance using Statview (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). PTH-stimulated cAMP Signaling by WT and Mutant PTH1R—To perform the structure-function analyses of PTH1R described in detail below, we generated a number of point mutations and/or deletions in the receptor second intracellular loop (IC2) and C terminus, as shown in Fig. 1, A and B. In addition, we used a previously described constitutively active mutant PTH1R, H223R (Jansen's mutant). To evaluate whether these mutant receptors were properly expressed and retained their cAMP signaling capacity, they were transiently expressed in HEK-293 cells and exposed to bPTH-(1–34) at increasing concentrations. Maximal cAMP accumulation after 30 min was similar for all mutants (range, 88–110% of wild-type), and the EC50 for PTH-stimulated cAMP signaling was in the subnanomolar range for all mutants (Fig. 1C). Gq Signaling-deficient PTH1R Mutants Abrogate ERK1/2 Activation—In HEK-293 cells expressing PTH1R, bPTH-(1–34) (100 nm) transiently activated ERK1/2 after 5 min, as evaluated by p42/44 phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). Prolonged exposure to PTH did not induce further activation of ERK1/2 (data not shown). In turn, the transcriptional activity of MAPK, as evaluated by an SRE-driven luciferase assay, was increased 7.9 ± 1.2-fold by PTH (mean ± S.E. from n = 9 independent experiments) (Fig. 2B). It has been reported that ERK1/2 cannot be activated by a cAMP signaling-selective PTH1R ligand that also prevents arrestin binding and receptor internalization (25Syme C.A. Friedman P.A. Bisello A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11281-11288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To directly evaluate whether Gq-mediated signaling is necessary for ERK1/2 activation, HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with Gq signaling-deficient PTH1R mutants carrying either an EKKY to DSEL mutation in the second intracellular loop (GqD-PTH1R) (Fig. 1) or the H223R mutation, i.e. a (cAMP) constitutively active mutant with deficient IP3 signaling (Jansen metaphyseal dysplasia mutant) (29Iida-Klein A. Guo J. Takemura M. Drake M.T. Potts Jr., J.T. Abou-Samra A. Bringhurst F.R. Segre G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6882-6889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 32Schipani E. Kruse K. Juppner H. Science. 1995; 268: 98-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 33Schipani E. Langman C.B. Parfitt A.M. Jensen G.S. Kikuchi S. Kooh S.W. Cole W.G. Juppner H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 708-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Both mutants displayed a significant reduction in PTH-stimulated ERK1/2 activation and related transcriptional activity (Fig. 2, A and B). This inhibition was mimicked by incubating HEK-293 cells expressing wild-type (WT) PTH1R with a specific PKC inhibitor (5 μm Gö6983) (Fig. 2, A and C). In contrast, the PKA inhibitor H89 (10 μm) had no effect on ERK1/2 activation and luciferase activity in response to PTH, and conversely, ERK1/2 was unresponsive to direct stimulation of adenylate cyclase with forskolin (10 μm) (Fig. 2, A and C). These data indicate that PTH-stimulated ERK1/2 activation requires Gq binding at the PTH1R and IP3/PKC signaling, whereas cAMP/PKA is not sufficient for this activation. PTH1R C-terminal Interaction with β-Arrestin and ERK1/2 Activation—We reported previously that PTH-stimulated PKC activation plays an important role for β-arrestin recruitment to PTH1R and that this interaction is further stabilized by the PTH1R proximal C terminus (7Ferrari S.L. Behar V. Chorev M. Rosenblatt M. Bisello A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29968-29975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 23Ferrari S.L. Bisello A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 149-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In turn, deleting a 28-amino acid region of the proximal C terminus (PCdel-PTH1R) (Fig. 1) abolished β-arrestin recruitment to cell membrane and thus receptor internalization, as evaluated by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3A), as well as ERK1/2 activation and transcriptional activity in response to PTH (Fig. 3, B and C). Because the PTH1R proximal C terminus has been reported recently to also be a docking site for Gβγ subunits (26Mahon M.J. Bonacci T.M. Divieti P. Smrcka A.V. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 136-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we further generated a β-arrestin-deficient PTH1R mutant (ArD-PTH1R) by mutating proximal serine residues to alanine in addition to a C-terminal deletion at aa 500, i.e. distal to the Gβγ docking region (Fig. 1). Similar to the homologous PTH2R in which these mutations restrain β-arrestin binding while retaining its ability to activate PKC (28Bisello A. Manen D. Pierroz D.D. Usdin T.B. Rizzoli R. Ferrari S.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1486-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), ArD-PTH1R failed to recruit β-arrestin2 and thus to internalize itself in response to PTH (Fig. 3A). In turn, in HEK-293 cells expressing the ArD-PTH1R mutant, ERK1/2 activation and transcriptional activity in response to PTH were both significantly decreased (p-ERK1/2, –58 ± 6.6%, n = 3, p < 0.0001; luciferase activity, –48 ± 5.4%, n = 3, p < 0.0001) (Fig. 3, B and C). To further delineate the role of β-arrestin in ERK1/2 activation, we used a dn β-arrestin2 mini-gene (aa 284–409) that contains the major binding domain to clathrin and thereby competes with endogenous β-arrestin2 for targeting the ligand-receptor complex to clathrin-coated vesicles (30Orsini M.J. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34616-34622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although this dn β-arrestin2 did not interfere with β-arrestin recruitment to activated WT PTH1R without inducing its internalization (Fig. 3A), it significantly decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation and luciferase reporter activity in response to PTH (p-ERK1/2, –46 ± 5.9%, n = 3, p < 0.0001; luciferase activity, –45 ± 4.8, n = 3, p < 0.0001) (Fig. 3, B and C). Taken together, these data indicate that PTH1R interaction with arrestins accounts for nearly half of ERK1/2 activation. Arrestins Mediate Src-dependent Activation of ERK1/2—Next, we investigated the role of c-Src in PTH-stimulated, arrestin-mediated activation of ERK1/2. The kinase-dead c-Src-K295M mutant (SrcK–) (31Abram C.L. Courtneidge S.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) inhibited PTH-stimulated ERK1/2 activation and significantly decreased its transcriptional activity (–43 ± 3.8%, n = 3, p < 0.001) (Fig. 4, A and C). Similar results were obtained with PP2, a specific c-Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor (–38 ± 4.4%, n = 4, p < 0.001) (Fig. 4C). HEK-293 cells were then transfected with His6-tagged PTH1R, c-Src, and GFP-tagged β-arrestin2. PTH treatment resulted in the co-precipitation of total and activated c-Src and of β-arrestin2 with PTH1R (Fig. 4B). In cells expressing the PCdel-PTH1R mutant that failed to recruit/bind arrestins (Fig. 3A), c-Src did not precipitate upon PTH stimulation. In contrast, a constitutively active c-Src-Y527A (SrcK+) mutant (31Abram C.L. Courtneidge S.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) was able to co-precipitate with PCdel-PTH1R, both before and after exposure to PTH, despite the absence of receptor-bound β-arrestin2 (Fig. 4B). This observation confirmed that, in addition to bind arrestins, the PTH1R proximal C terminus is involved in c-Src activation (26Mahon M.J. Bonacci T.M. Divieti P. Smrcka A.V. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 136-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and suggested the presence of PTH1R domain(s) (outside of the proximal C terminus) capable of interacting directly with activated c-Src. PTH1R Proline-rich Motifs Stabilize the Src-Arrestin Complex for ERK1/2 Activation—Four proline-rich (PXXP) motifs were identified in the receptor C terminus distal to aa 515 and mutated to alanine (PXXP → AXXA) to generate a proline-deficient PTH1R mutant (PrD-PTH1R) (Fig. 1). Similar to the other mutant receptors used in this study, PrD-PTH1R had a cAMP response to PTH similar to WT (Fig. 1). PrD-PTH1R resulted in a complete loss of c-Src and, surprisingly, β-arrestin2 co-precipitation (Fig. 4B). In contrast, constitutively active c-Src (SrcK+) co-precipitated with proline-deficient PTH1R, both before and after PTH stimulation, and co-precipitation of arrestin with the receptor was also restored (Fig. 4B). Fluoroscopy of β-arrestin2-GFP showed that the initial phase of arres"

In eukaryotes, the primer region is raised into a flap by the strand displacement activity of DNA polymerase δ. The Dna2 helicase/nuclease and then flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) are proposed to act sequentially in flap removal. Dna2 and FEN1 both employ a tracking mechanism to enter the flap 5′ end and move toward the base for cleavage. In the current model, Dna2 must enter first, but FEN1 makes the final cut at the flap base, raising the issue of how FEN1 passes the Dna2. To address this, nuclease-inactive Dna2 was incubated with a DNA flap substrate and found to bind with high affinity. FEN1 was then added, and surprisingly, there was little inhibition of FEN1 cleavage activity. FEN1 was later shown, by gel shift analysis, to remove the wild type Dna2 from the flap. RNA can be cleaved by FEN1 but not by Dna2. Pre-bound wild type Dna2 was shown to bind an RNA flap but not inhibit subsequent FEN1 cleavage. These results indicate that there is a novel interaction between the two proteins in which FEN1 disengages the Dna2 tracking mechanism. This interaction is consistent with the idea that the two proteins have evolved a special ability to cooperate in Okazaki fragment processing.

Replication of eukaryotic cellular DNA involves the synthesis and joining of Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand. These fragments are 100-150 nucleotides long in eukaryotes (1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication, 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman, New York1992: 140-144Google Scholar).

Polymerase ϵ (pol ϵ) may also play a role in lagging strand synthesis or processing, because some portion of the cellular proliferating cell nuclear antigen is bound by pol ϵ during S-phase (3Hubscher U.

This flap must then be processed to form a continuous strand of DNA, a pathway known as Okazaki fragment processing (OFP).Several models of OFP have been developed from reconstitution studies in vitro in which nuclease activity is used to remove the primer made by pol α followed by ligation to form a continuous strand (6Maga G.

Dna2 was further implicated in OFP when the ssDNA-binding protein, replication protein A (RPA), was shown to physically interact with Dna2 (27Bae K.H. Kim H.S. Bae S.H. Kang H.Y. Brill S. Seo Y.S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 38022-38031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In this model, flaps displaced by pol δ reach a length that allows them to be coated by RPA. Bound RPA inhibits cleavage by FEN1 but not by Dna2. Dna2 would then cleave these RPA-coated flaps, releasing RPA. Dna2 does not have cleavage specificity for the flap base (14Kao H.I. Veeraraghavan J. Polaczek P. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15014-15024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Instead it produces short (5-7 nucleotides), RPA-free flaps that are substrates for FEN1. The current view is that some portion of OFP occurs by the RPA/Dna2/FEN1 pathway (9Rossi M.L. Purohit V. Brandt P.D. Bambara R.A. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 453-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).The model above suggests that a unique interplay between Dna2 and FEN1 exists. As stated previously, FEN1 and Dna2 interact physically with each other. The experiments discussed in this paper are used to further understand the interaction between these two proteins. Both FEN1 and Dna2 have been shown to employ a tracking mechanism to cleave the flap substrate (13Murante R.S. Rust L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30377-30383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 30Kao H.I. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 10498-10505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). They both must interact with the 5′ end of the flap and then move to the site of cleavage. Dna2 was found to act as if it were threaded onto the flap like a bead on a string (30Kao H.I. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50840-50849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Because they are proposed to act in order, the Dna2 must cleave but then allow the FEN1 to have access to the 5′ end of the shorter flap. In this study, we used a nuclease-inactive Dna2 to block the base of a flap substrate and then determined whether FEN1 could access the substrate. Surprisingly, FEN1 was capable of efficient cleavage. We then explored the mechanism by which FEN1 could reach its cleavage site.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Synthetic oligonucleotides, including the 5′-biotin conjugation, were produced by Integrated DNA Technologies. Radionucleotide [α-32P]dCTP (6000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and ATP were from Roche Applied Science. All other reagents were the best available commercial grade.Enzyme Expression and Purification—S. cerevisiae Dna2 was cloned into the Sf9 baculovirus expression vector (Invitrogen). It was then expressed and purified as described previously (18Budd M.E. Choe W. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16518-16529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), except that High Five cells were utilized for the final expression step of the protein. S. cerevisiae Dna2 E675A was created by site-directed mutagenesis as described in Ref. 18Budd M.E. Choe W. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16518-16529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar. It was then expressed and purified as described above for the wild type Dna2. S. cerevisiae FEN1 was cloned into the T7 expression vector pET-FCH and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. It was then purified as described previously (26Kao H.I. Henricksen L.A. Liu Y. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14379-14389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar).Oligonucleotides—All downstream primers were labeled at the 3′ terminus with [α-32P]dCTP (6000 Ci/mmol) by the Klenow enzyme. They were then purified on a 12% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea. DNA substrates were annealed in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and substrates containing RNA were annealed in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm NaCl. For annealing, substrates were incubated at 95 °C for 5 min and then cooled slowly to room temperature. Protector RNase Inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) was then added to RNA-containing substrates. All substrates were annealed in a 1:2:4 ratio of downstream primer to template to upstream primer. Most experiments described were done using a 53-nucleotide DNA flap substrate. This substrate consisted of the following: downstream primer-5′-/biotin/GTACCGAGCTCGAATTCGCCCGTTTCACGCCTGTTAGTTAATTCACTGGCCGTCGTTTTACAACGACGTGACTGGG-3′, upstream primer-5′-CGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGACA-3′, and template-5′-GCCCAGTCACGTCGTTGTAAAACGGGTCGTGACTGGGAAAACCCTGGCG-3′. The experiments shown in Fig. 5 involved a 30-nucleotide RNA flap substrate, which consisted of the following primers (RNA is in bold): downstream primer-5′-GUCACGCCUGUUAGUUAAUUCACUGGCCGUCCACCCGUCCACCCGACG-3′, upstream primer-5′-CGACCGTGCCAGCCTAAATTTCAAGA-3′, and template-5′-GCGTCGGGTGGACGGGTGGCTTGAAATTTAGGCTGGCACGGTCG-3′.Nuclease Assay—The reaction buffer for both Dna2 and FEN1 reactions consisted of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 30 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, and 10 μm ATP. The reaction mixture volume was 20 μl, which included 5 fmol of labeled substrate and various amounts of enzymes, as indicated in the figure legends. Reactions were then incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, unless otherwise indicated, and stopped with a 2× termination dye (90% formamide (v/v), 10 mm EDTA, with 0.01% bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol). Reactions were then separated on a 15% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea. Pre-binding Dna2 conditions were as follows. Dna2 and labeled substrate were mixed, incubated for 10 min on ice, and then incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. In Figs. 1B and 5B, Dna2 was pre-bound prior to FEN1 addition. In Figs. 1B and 3, streptavidin was used in 50-fold excess over substrate and was conjugated to the 5′-biotin by incubation at 37 °C for 10 min. In Fig. 2, 50 microunits of micrococcal nuclease (Fermentas) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 30 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2 mm CaCl2 was added after Dna2 E675A was bound to substrate, as described previously. The reaction was then incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. For experiments using RNA, Protector RNase Inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) was added to help prevent RNA degradation.FIGURE 1FEN1 cleavage is not inhibited by Dna2 E675A-bound flaps.

All gels, after running conditions, were transferred to filter paper and dried on a gel dryer (Bio-Rad) with vacuum (Savant) for 1 h at 80°C.

Gel analysis was then performed using ImageQuantMac, version 1.2 (GE Healthcare).RESULTSDna2 is expected to precede FEN1 in tracking on a flap during OFP. Even after cleavage by Dna2 its helicase activity would be expected to drive it onto the flap so that it would block the entry of FEN1. It is known that FEN1 can access the flap after Dna2 cleavage. We hypothesized that the two proteins are designed to allow efficient, successive action. To understand how Dna2 works with FEN1, we assessed FEN1 binding and cleavage to a flap already occupied by a Dna2 molecule.Dna2 E675A Binds Flaps but Does Not Inhibit FEN1—Dna2 E675A was characterized previously and shown to be defective in nuclease activity while retaining helicase activity (18Budd M.E. Choe W. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16518-16529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We confirmed both a defect in cleavage activity and retention of helicase activity of Dna2 E675A on a flap substrate (data not shown). It was previously shown that Dna2 binds to flap substrates by gel shift assay (28Bae S.H. Bae K.H. Kim J.A. Seo Y.S. Nature. 2001; 412: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). We tested whether Dna2 E675A could bind to a flap substrate and block FEN1 cleavage. Because we have previously shown that FEN1 requires a free 5′ end for tracking to the base of the flap and cleavage (13Murante R.S. Rust L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30377-30383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that Dna2 E675A binding would inhibit FEN1 cleavage at the base of the flap. The approach was to load Dna2 so that it tracks or binds to the base of the flap but does not cleave. We used an ATP concentration that allows the Dna2 to bind onto the flap but does not make the helicase function so potently that it displaces the flap and dissociates the primer from the template (data not shown). Fig. 1A shows native PAGE separation of the 53-nucleotide flap substrate with Dna2 E675A present. Upon addition of purified Dna2 E675A (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 3), we saw a gel shift from the position of the DNA only band (Fig. 1A, lane 1) to a higher molecular weight band signifying binding. The fraction of shifted DNA was dependent on Dna2 E675A concentration. At 200 fmol of Dna2 E675A (Fig. 1A, lane 3), at least 80% of the DNA was bound with protein, as some portion of the protein may have been dissociated during electrophoresis.Dna2 E675A was then pre-bound, under the same conditions shown in Fig. 1A, lane 3, to the 53-nucleotide flap substrate. This should have prevented FEN1 access to at least 80% of the substrate molecules. FEN1 was added to the reaction mixture at the end of the pre-binding period. When FEN1 was incubated with the substrate in the absence of Dna2 E675A (Fig. 1B, circles), an increasing amount of flaps were cleaved over time. Upon addition of FEN1 to pre-bound substrate (Fig. 1B, squares), the flaps were also cleaved efficiently. Surprisingly, the presence of the Dna2 E675A made only a slight difference in the amount of cleavage, indicating that the FEN1 had access to its cleavage site on nearly all of the substrates. Inhibition of FEN1 cleavage by Dna2 E675A was compared with that of a 5′ streptavidin-biotin-blocked flap (Fig. 1B, diamonds). The almost complete elimination of cleavage activity verifies that prevention of FEN1 entry to the flap is an effective deterrent to cleavage.The early time points can be used to compare relative rates of cleavage (Fig. 1B, 0.5 and 1 min). Blockage of the flaps by Dna2 E675A resulted in a less than 2-fold decrease in cleavage rate (compare Fig. 1B, squares and circles), strikingly less inhibitory than the effect of streptavidin (Fig. 1B, diamonds). The difference in rate was reduced to only 4% by 10 min, simply because cleavage goes to near completion even in the presence of Dna2 E675A. Moreover, cleavage products made by FEN1, as seen on the gel, appeared identical on both unblocked and Dna2 E475A-blocked substrates (data not shown). This demonstrates that FEN1 reached the base of the flap for cleavage at its preferred site in both cases. Titrations of Dna2 E675A up to 200 fmol were performed in the pre-binding reaction and showed no significant effect on the amount of FEN1 cleavage (data not shown). Overall, these results show that FEN1 can bypass Dna2 bound on a flap, thus gaining access to the flap base for cleavage.Dna2 E675A Should Block FEN1 Access to the Flap—Because Dna2 appears to thread onto the flap, it is difficult to visualize how FEN1 could cleave around a bound Dna2 molecule. We determined whether FEN1 would have access to the flap during brief absences of Dna2, as might occur if Dna2 proteins occasionally slide off the 5′ end of the flap. Dna2 E675A was bound to the 53-nucleotide labeled DNA flap substrate, and micrococcal nuclease was then added (Fig. 2). Micrococcal nuclease is an endonuclease, which, unlike Dna2 or FEN1, has no loading requirement and can readily cleave exposed DNA. In addition, it prefers ssDNA over double-stranded DNA. In Fig. 2, Dna2 E675A was bound prior to micrococcal nuclease addition. This allowed us to evaluate the percent of substrates that were inaccessible to micrococcal nuclease and thus protected by bound Dna2 E675A. Fig. 2, lane 2, shows the amount of micrococcal nuclease cleavage without Dna2 E675A present. In contrast, when Dna2 E675A was bound to the substrate prior to micrococcal nuclease addition, there was a decrease in the amount of products formed after a 10-min incubation with micrococcal nuclease (Fig. 2, lanes 3-5). Upon quantitation of the protected area (indicated in Fig. 2), we"

Several investigators have linked heparan sulfate (HS) alterations in the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) with albuminuria as a marker of abnormal blood filtration and the subsequent progression to renal failure. In this study, we examined the fine structure of HS in the glomerulus and the GBM isolated from the kidneys of rats injected with streptozotocin. Using fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis, we obtained disaccharide composition analyses for HS. In a time course study, we observed that normal rat HS isolated from the GBM becomes more N-sulfated as the glomeruli mature over a period of 8 weeks. Diabetic rats injected with streptozotocin at the beginning of this period showed a reversal of this trend. Using a graded sieve technique, we found that two different sizes of glomeruli could be isolated from the rat kidneys and that there was a significant difference in the HS disaccharide content between these two pools of glomeruli. Only the larger sized glomeruli had less N-sulfation of HS as a result of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. This change in the fine structure of HS was localized to the GBM and was not associated with cell surface HS. We also generated oligosaccharides of HS that portray fine structural alterations in the diabetic rats indicative of a loss of the sulfation of N-acetylglucosamine.

One of these is nephropathy, representing the single most important cause of renal failure for adults in the Western world (1Mauer S.M. Kidney Int. 1994; 45: 612-622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). At the onset of IDDM, patients exhibit an elevated glomerular filtration rate (GFR), nephromegaly, and low levels of albuminuria (2Davidson J.K. Seils A. Clinical Diabetes Mellitus: A Problem-Oriented Approach. Thieme Medical PublishersInc., New York2000: 37-58Google Scholar). Within the first few years after onset, morphological changes in the kidney include the thickening of the glomerular and tubular basement membranes and the accumulation of periodic acid-Schiff-positive material in the mesangium (3Osterby R. Diabetologia. 1992; 35: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 4Osterby R. Parving H.H. Hommel E. Jorgensen H.E. Lokkegaard H.

Although glycemic control results in the decline of the GFR and the abatement of albuminuria, the symptoms may return in 10–20 years. As albuminuria slowly increases, the GFR begins to decrease, and an increase in blood pressure is often concomitant. Despite the common morphological changes associated with nephropathy, only 20% will result in end-stage renal disease. The glomerulus is a tuft of anastomosing capillaries supported by a mesangial network and enclosed in Bowman capsule (6McCarthy K.J. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1997; 39: 233-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This tuft consists of three cell populations as follows: (a) the visceral epithelial cells (podocytes), (b) the capillary endothelium, and (c) the mesangial cells. The podocytes include the external aspect of the capillary array and possess “foot” processes, called pedicels, that are connected by structures known as slit diaphragms. The endothelial cells line the inner aspect of the capillaries and possess fenestrae that lack the typical diaphragms observed in other fenestrated endothelium. The mesangial cells are axial within the glomerular tuft, resembling fibroblasts situated within their own interstitial matrix and provide a structural framework for the support of the capillaries. The glomerulus is composed of two extracellular matrices, namely the glomerular basement membrane and the mesangial matrix. Despite their close juxtaposition and interaction at specific sites, they are distinct from one another in both their spatial orientation as well as their structural constituents. The GBM is a continuous matrix sheet underlying the inner perimeter of the capillaries and the outer perimeter of the mesangium. It is a trilaminar structure consisting of the lamina rara externa, a lamina densa, and a lamina rara interna, although it lacks a reticular lamina typical of most basement membranes (7Farquhar M.G. Hay E.D. Cell Biology of Extracellular Matrix. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1991: 365-418Crossref Google Scholar). The structural components of these matrices that have received wide attention regarding their function in glomerular filtration are the proteoglycans (PGs). Because of their high charge to mass density, the PGs are thought to regulate blood filtration by the effect of charge and size selection. The dominant features of PGs that contribute to these biophysical properties are the nature of their glycosaminoglycans. Heparan sulfate (HS), chondroitin sulfate (CS), and hyaluronan are the only glycosaminoglycans localized to the GBM and mesangium. They are linear polymers, consisting of repeating units of Glc-NAc or GalNAc, alternating with GlcUA. HS and CS are attached to the parent protein cores via a tetrasaccharide linked to serine-glycine residues. After the initial synthesis of the carbohydrate backbone, an epimerase and several sulfotransferases modify the fine structure of glycosaminoglycans. These modifications vary between cell type, localization, and environmental status. Although little is known about the function of CS in the glomerulus, there is evidence to suggest that HS is essential for the maintenance of proper glomerular filtration. For example, it has been shown that removal of HSs from the GBM in vivo in rats by digestion with heparitinase leads to increased urinary secretion of both ferritin and albumin (8Kanwar Y.S. Linker A. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 688-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 9Rosenzweig L.J. Kanwar Y.S. Lab. Investig. 1982; 47: 177-184PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, by injecting antibodies into the bloodstream that have immunoreactivity against HS, an acute case of proteinuria developed (10van den Born J. van den Heuvel L.P. Bakker M.A. Veerkamp J.H. Assmann K.J. Berden J.H. Kidney Int. 1992; 41: 115-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). These observations are further substantiated by a study of renal biopsies from patients with diabetic nephropathy, revealing a decrease in HS staining in the GBM without corresponding changes in the core proteins of HSPGs (11Tamsma J.T. van den Born J. Bruijn J.A. Assmann K.J. Weening J.J. Berden J.H. Wieslander J. Schrama E. Hermans J. Veerkamp J.H. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In this paper, we examine the fine structural features of HS in glomeruli and the GBM in the STZ rat model (IDDM) (12Rees D.A. Alcolado J.C. Diabet. Med. 2005; 22: 359-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 13O'Donnell M.P. Kasiske B.L. Keane W.F. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2339-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Using fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE), we present disaccharide composition and oligosaccharide analyses for HS. We put these results in the context of previously reported data and highlight differences in important experimental parameters that can aid data comparison. Furthermore, we discuss the biological implications of our findings and offer potential cellular mechanisms that could be responsible for the diabetic related changes in HS noted in this study. Animals and Animal Care—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (150–174 g) were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN) and housed under conditions of constant temperature with a 12-h light/dark cycle. Food and water were available ad libitum. The rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (Abbot Laboratories, North Chicago, IL), weighed, and injected with 55 mg/kg STZ by adding the appropriate volume of the drug at 25 mg/ml in 10 mm sodium citrate, pH 4.5, via tail vein injections. The rats were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation at 3 days, 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks post-injection for a time course study. Blood-Glucose Analysis—Three days after STZ injection, the rats were anesthetized as before, and 5 μl of blood was taken from the tail vein and placed in 95 μl of 100 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.0. This solution was heated at 100 °C for 10 min, placed on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min to pellet the insoluble material. 2 μl of the supernatant was transferred to a new tube, lyophilized, and directly labeled with AMAC in 80 μl. To 4 μl of this sample was added 2.9 μlof glycerol, of which 5 μl was added to a MONO® composition gel (Prozyme, San Leandro, CA). Animals were considered hyperglycemic and used for further analysis if their blood-glucose was >2.0-fold higher than the average control. This procedure was repeated at the time of sacrifice to confirm the diabetic state. Isolation of Glomeruli—Immediately after sacrifice, the two kidneys of each rat were removed and weighed. The capsules were removed, and the kidneys from each rat were minced together with a razor blade for 10 min. Afterward, the kidney paste was transferred to a Cellector® tissue sieve (Bellco Glass, Inc., Vineland, NJ) and sieved in the gradations 190, 140, 94, and 74 μm. At every gradation, the filtrate was washed with generous amounts of phosphate-buffered saline. Depending upon the size of the animal at the time of sacrifice, we noticed that two different sizes of glomeruli could be retained by the 94- and 74-μm screens (see under “Results” and under “Discussion”). The isolated glomeruli were transferred to 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. A standard aliquot of each was transferred to a slide, and the glomeruli were manually counted using a dissection microscope. This was repeated one time for each sample. At least 50 glomeruli were counted each time. Afterward, the glomeruli were allowed to air-dry and were reconstituted in water for area measurement. Phase contrast images were taken at 10× magnification. For each group, 40 glomeruli were traced using Image-Pro® software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD), and the areas within the traced glomeruli were quantified. Afterward, the glomeruli were appropriately divided for further analyses as follows. One-third was transferred to a separate vial. This portion was directly prepared for HS analysis and is labeled as “glomeruli” in the figures. From the other two-thirds we isolated the “GBM.” For both the glomerular and GBM samples, one-half of the total was applied to the gel. For the time course, each data point was a compilation of 3 rats (n = 3), except for week 8, which used 12 rats per data point. For the preparation of HS oligosaccharides isolated from week 8 glomeruli, we took two-thirds of week 8 glomeruli and pooled the samples from each group (i.e. diabetic and control). Of this fraction, one-third of the glomeruli was used to prepare glomerular HS oligosaccharides, and the remaining two-thirds was used to prepare GBM HS oligosaccharides. Thus, each oligosaccharide sample was an average of the glomeruli from 12 rats. One-third of the total sample was applied to the FACE gel for the large glomeruli. One-half of the total sample was used for the small glomeruli. This amount of sample was required to obtain a sufficient signal for FACE. HS disaccharide analysis (Fig. 7 and the week 8 portion of the time course) was also done on a portion (one-third) of the starting material and required the equivalent of two rats to get a sufficient signal per lane of a FACE gel. In other words, these week 8 disaccharide analyses were n = 6, although the sample was derived from 12 rats. The oligosaccharide data presented in Figs. 10 and 11 represent portions of the glomeruli that were used to generate the data in Fig. 7 and the week 8 portion of the time course.FIGURE 10Heparan sulfate oligosaccharides 8 weeks after the onset of diabetes. A and B show FACE gels of HS oligosaccharides derived from large and small glomeruli, respectively. Lanes 1 and 6–8 portray oligosaccharides with 4, 6, 8, and 10 HS disaccharide standards, respectively. The various bands for each oligosaccharide standard represent different sulfation patterns for each set of oligosaccharides. Glomerular samples are presented in lanes 2 and 3, and the comparative GBM samples are in lanes 4 and 5. Controls are in lanes 2 and 4 (labeled “C”), and diabetic samples are in lanes 3 and 5 (labeled “D”). Each sample represents a compilation of 12 rats. The dominant standard oligosaccharides are designated on the gel as s1–s4 for the tetramers and as s5–s7 for the hexamers. The six major HS oligosaccharides generated as a product of heparitinase I digestion of our samples are labeled r1–r6. White lines were inserted to mark the points at which our sample oligosaccharides bisect the standards. The DNA contents for the glomerular extracts are given at the bottom of the gel and were used to normalize the oligosaccharides quantified in Fig. 11.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 1Establishment of the STZ rat model of diabetes.

Templeton D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1136: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). For GBM preparation, two-thirds of the glomeruli from two kidneys were transferred to 2-ml screw-cap microcentrifuge tubes. Each glomerular sample was suspended in 1 ml of room temperature distilled water containing 0.05% sodium azide, 5 mm benzamidine-HCl, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 10 mm disodium EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. The glomeruli were constantly vortexed at medium speed for 1 h and pelleted by centrifugation at 50 × g. This step was repeated one time. The pellet was further extracted for 1 h using 1 ml of 3% Triton X-100 in the protease inhibitor mixture described above, vortexed, and pelleted as before. The pellet was rinsed four times in 1 ml of distilled water and digested for 1 h with 50 units of DNase I (Ambion, Austin, TX) in 1 ml of 1 m NaCl at 37 °C. The remaining pellet was extracted twice for 1 h each time with 1 ml of 4% sodium deoxycholate at room temperature in the protease inhibitor mixture. The resulting GBM preparation was rinsed five times with distilled water and resuspended in 900 μl of distilled water for subsequent proteinase K digestion. Preparation of Heparan Sulfate Samples—All samples were prepared for fluorescent derivatization in the following manner. Each extract was suspended in 900 μl of distilled water, to which 50 μl of proteinase K (2.5 mg/ml) in 1 m ammonium acetate, pH 7.0, was added, and the sample was incubated at 60 °C for 2 h with vortexing at the 1-h mark. Another 50-μl aliquot of proteinase K was added, and the incubation was repeated as before. Proteinase K was inactivated by incubation at 100 °C for 10 min. The samples were then cooled on ice for 10 min, and brought to 250 μl by vacuum concentration. 1 ml of ice-cold absolute EtOH was added to each sample and maintained at –20 °C overnight. Glycosaminoglycans were pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min. Each pellet was suspended and washed with 1.25 ml of 75% EtOH, pelleted as before, and air-dried for 20 min at room temperature. Each dried pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of 100 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.0, and digested with 4 μl each of 1 milliunit/μl heparinase, heparitinase I, and heparitinase II for complete digestion or with heparitinase I only for the generation of oligosaccharides, giving a total reaction volume of 32 μl. The digests were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h with vortexing on the hour. The endoeliminases were inactivated by incubation at 100 °C for 10 min, and the samples were subsequently cooled on ice for 10 min. For disaccharide analysis, the samples containing HS digests were lyophilized and directly derivatized with 2-aminoacridone (AMAC) (Invitrogen). For oligosaccharide analysis, the digests were precipitated in 82.5% EtOH, and the pellet was derivatized with AMAC. Fluorescent Derivatization of Heparan Sulfate Samples with 2-Aminoacridone (15Calabro A. Midura R. Wang A. West L. Plaas A. Hascall V.C. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2001; 9: 16-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar)—Each sample, representing a portion of the glomeruli or GBM from two kidneys, was labeled in an 8-μl reaction volume using PCR tubes and low retention pipette tips. Briefly, 4 μl of 12.5 mm AMAC (85% Me2SO and 15% glacial acetic acid) was added to each lyophilized sample, and the solution was incubated at 25 °C for 20 min. 3One of the reviewers of the initial submission of this paper brought to our attention that the 20-min exposure of the disaccharides to an acid pH would likely cause some desulfation of the N-sulfated disaccharides. The FACE analyses in the Supplemental Material for this paper show the effect of the acidic condition on AMAC derivatives and FACE analyses of Δdisaccharides generated from heparan sulfate, and that this treatment caused an identical decrease in all the N-sulfated disaccharides with time. The 20-min composite value was 16%. No changes were observed in the N-acetylated disaccharides. All of the disaccharide data in the figures in this study have therefore been corrected for this 16% loss. We thank the reviewer for preventing us from making this error. It should also be noted that the procedure we now use for FACE analysis of heparan sulfate circumvents this problem by adding the cyanoborohydride at time 0, which maintains a near neutral pH during the entire AMAC procedure. The oligosaccharide analysis (Figs. 10 and 11) in this paper was done under these corrected conditions. Then 4 μl of 1.25 m sodium cyanoborohydride in distilled water was added, followed by an overnight (16–18 h) incubation at 37 °C. The next day, 2.9 μl of 50% glycerol containing 0.43 m Trizma (Tris base) and 4% NaOH was added to 4 μl of each reaction mixture, and the samples were incubated at 25 °C for 20 min. 5 μl of each glycerol/reaction mixture solution was loaded onto the gel. PAGE—HS disaccharides and oligosaccharides were analyzed using OLIGO® profiling gels and companion buffers (Prozyme, San Leandro, CA). The glass plates of the pre-cast gels were washed with distilled water and inserted into the gel box, and the wells were thoroughly washed with running buffer. The gel box was placed in a large container filled with ice and allowed to equilibrate to 4 °C for 1–2 h. All samples were loaded simultaneously in 5-μl aliquots using a Hamilton 8-channel glass syringe (Reno, NV). The OLIGO® gels were subjected to 15 mA/gel (constant) for about 1 h and 45 min. The gels were washed with distilled water and imaged while in their glass plates. Digital Imaging and Data Analysis—After electrophoresis, the gels were placed on a UV transilluminator (Ultra Lum, Claremont, CA) and illuminated at 365 nm. Imaging was done on a Quantix CCD camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ), and HS was quantified using Gel-Pro Analyzer® version 3.0 (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). We have used two parameters to substantiate the effect of STZ injection upon the development of experimental diabetes in our rat model. The first parameter is the fold increase in diabetic glucose concentration in the blood in relation to the blood-glucose of the control animals. Fig. 1A shows a representative FACE gel of the blood-glucose for diabetic animals compared with control. The quantification of this measurement is shown in Fig. 1B. Any animals with a blood-glucose level <2.0-fold of the control animals were not considered to be diabetic, and all data derived from them were discarded. Bloodglucose levels were also confirmed at the time of sacrifice (data not shown). The second parameter used to substantiate a diabetic state was the ratios of the average kidney weight from an animal in relation to the body weight of that animal. Fig. 1C shows the average kidney weight in relation to the body weight of the same animals and compared with the average for controls. In the STZ model, diabetic animals have lower body weights because of the inability to properly utilize blood-glucose. In contrast, their kidney weights increase as a result of renal disease. Glomeruli were isolated from minced kidneys by graded sieving. Although unexpected, we noticed that glomeruli could be isolated from both 94–140-μm (“large”) and 74–94-μm (“small”) range sieves. Large and small glomeruli were readily isolated from both diabetic and control rat kidneys. The purity of the glomeruli in each fraction was noted visually and was >90% with little tubular contamination. The average size of week 8 large and small glomeruli can be seen in Fig. 2, A and B. The quantified areas of the glomeruli are shown in Fig. 2C. There was a statistical difference in these two sizes of glomeruli for both the diabetic and control rats (p < 0.0001). Although there was no difference in the large glomeruli when the diabetic rat was compared with the control rat, the small glomeruli were statistically different (0.00046). This suggests that the small diabetic glomeruli had enlarged by week 8. To examine the changes in HS disaccharide composition in the glomeruli and GBM during the onset and development of diabetes, a time course study was implemented. As the control rats aged from day 3 to week 8, the large glomeruli population increased although the small glomeruli did not significantly change (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the small glomeruli of the diabetic rats decreased at weeks 4 and 8, whereas the large glomeruli increased proportionally (Fig. 3B). There was a statistically significant (p = 0.004) greater number (38%) of large rather than small glomeruli in the diabetic population at week 8, although they were equivalent in the control. Fig. 4 shows a representative FACE gel of HS disaccharides 8 weeks after the onset of diabetes. Under optimum conditions, this technique resolves six major bands. The identity of these disaccharides is listed in Fig. 4 legend and includes two N-acetylated disaccharides (bands 1 and 3) and four N-sulfated disaccharides (bands 2, 4, 5, and 6). The dominant disaccharide observed in rat glomeruli and GBM is Δdi-N-acetylglucosamine (band 1), followed in intensity by its 2–4 times less abundant N-sulfated form (band 2). The remaining disaccharides (bands 3–6) are 4–6 times less abundant than the acetylated form. As indicated in Figs. 5 and 7, we multiplied the data values of the less abundant disaccharides by factors of 2 or 4 so that their trends could be better compared with Δdi-N-acetylglucosamine.FIGURE 5Time course for heparan sulfate disaccharides in the glomerular basement membrane after the onset of diabetes. N-Acetylated disaccharides are shown as white bars. N-Sulfated disaccharides are shown as gray bars. Each segment of five bars represents day 3 and weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8 from left to right. A and B present the HS disaccharides from the GBM of the large glomeruli for the control and diabetic rats, respectively. C and D present the HS disaccharides from the GBM of the small glomeruli for the control and diabetic rats, respectively. The disaccharides are listed as 1–5 on the x axis. They are the same as the disaccharides presented in Fig. 4, except that 5 includes ΔU-N-sulfated and 6-sulfated N-glucosamine and 2-sulfated glucuronic acid with N-sulfated and 6-sulfated glucosamine (see text). The disaccharides are presented as a percentage of the total (y axis). The value for disaccharides “2, 4, and 5” were multiplied two times so that their data points could be better visualized. Similarly, the values for disaccharide 3 were multiplied four times for better visualization. Each of the data points was a compilation of 3 rats (n = 3), except for week 8 which used 12 rats per data point. The error bars represent S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Depending upon the gel lot, disaccharides 5 and 6 merged, resolving five total bands instead of six. Such was the case for all time points except week 8. The resolution of disaccharides 5 and 6 did not affect our study because both of these disaccharides are N-sulfated, and our primary conclusions involved comparing the N-acetylated and the N-sulfated disaccharides. For the sake of simplicity, the 5th band in the quantified disaccharide data in Figs. 5 and 7 represents the sum of N-sulfated disaccharides 5 and 6. We used FACE to examine HS disaccharides during a time course study (Fig. 5). N-Sulfated disaccharides are presented in Fig. 5 as gray bars and N-acetylated disaccharides are white bars. The disaccharides derived from the GBM of the large glomeruli showed significant changes over the time course. Specifically, as the control rats aged from day 3 to 8 weeks (Fig. 5A), the primary N-acetylated disaccharide decreased (band 1), and the primary N-sulfated form significantly increased (band 2). In contrast, the diabetic N-acetylated disaccharides did not decrease over time (Fig 5B, bands 1 and 3), whereas the N-sulfated disaccharides either decreased (bands 4 and 5) or did not change at all (band 2). The GBM derived from the small glomeruli of control rats showed a reversal of the trend observed in the large glomeruli. In this extract, the primary N-sulfated disaccharide (Fig. 5C, band 2) significantly decreased over time, whereas the N-acetylated disaccharides either increased (band 3) or did not change (band 1). In contrast, the GBM derived from the small glomeruli of diabetic rats showed no changes over the time course (Fig. 5D), except for a slight increase in the minor N-acetylated disaccharide (band 3). We compiled all of the N-sulfated disaccharides (gray bars) and compared them with the N-acetylated disaccharides (white bars) for the GBM of the large and small glomeruli (Fig. 6). The N-sulfated disaccharides in the GBM of the large glomeruli from the controls steadily increased 9.7% from day 3 to week 8 (Fig. 6A). In contrast, the N-sulfated disaccharides in the GBM of the small glomeruli from the controls decreased –11.0% from day 3 to week 8 and 3.2% for the diabetics ("

Genomic sequence mining reveals many more T4SSs of unknown function.

In nature, Agrobacterium uses the vir-encoded T4SS to genetically modify a large number of dicotyledonous plants by transferring a DNA portion, termed the T strand, from itself to plant cells. The cellular changes set in motion by the integration of the T strand give rise to crown gall disease. In the laboratory, the vir-encoded T4SS transfers DNA and protein substrates to bacteria, plants, fungi, and mammalian cells.

VirB4, the largest T4SS protein, has at least three predicted domains. An N-terminal domain (residues 172-375) belongs to the CagE_TrbE_VirB PFAM family (6Bateman A. Coin L. Durbin R. Finn R.D.

Sjolander K. Foley J. Zambryski P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1685-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Indeed, biochemical fractionation reveals that VirB4 forms oligomers of hexameric size (9Yuan Q. Carle A. Gao C. Sivanesan D. Aly K.A. Hoppner C. Krall L. Domke N. Baron C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26349-26359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Both the VirB11 and VirD4 homologs also form hexameric oligomers (10Yeo H.J. Savvides S.N. Herr A.B. Lanka E. Waksman G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1461-1472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 11Gomis-Ruth F.X. Moncalian G. Perez-Luque R. Gonzalez A. de la Cabezon E. Cruz F. Coll M. Nature. 2001; 409: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), a common feature of ATPases (12Iyer L.M. Leipe D.D. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 146: 11-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). All three ATPases (VirB4, VirB11, and VirD4) physically interact and are proposed to mediate initial T strand substrate transport (13Atmakuri K. Cascales E. Christie P.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 1199-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Although VirD4 and VirB11 have been placed at the entrance of the T4SS (14Cascales E. Christie P.J. Science. 2004; 304: 1170-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), the relative position and orientation of VirB4 with regard to these two hexamers are not known. We previously proposed that VirB4 was located in the cytoplasm, acting in concert with VirD4 (8Middleton R. Sjolander K. Foley J. Zambryski P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1685-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This assignment was based solely on the striking structural similarity between the C terminus of VirB4 and the cytoplasmic domain of TrwB, a VirD4 homolog. This hypothesis was without experimental support. Here, we have used a combination of yeast two-hybrid, biochemical, bioinformatic, and genetic methods to address the topology of the C terminus of VirB4. We present two-hybrid interactions between the C terminus of VirB4 and the periplasmic domains of several proteins, VirB1, VirB8, and VirB10. Cell fractionation studies reveal that the C-terminal half of VirB4 is localized to the periplasm, and genetic studies suggest it is physically involved in transporter function in vivo. We have further oriented VirB4 in relation to VirB11. To enable these latter studies, we have generated a structural model of Agrobacterium VirB11 based on a bioinformatics comparison with the solved structure of the Helicobacter pylori homolog HP0525 (10Yeo H.J. Savvides S.N. Herr A.B. Lanka E. Waksman G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1461-1472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and presented a refined model of our recently predicted VirB4 structure (8Middleton R. Sjolander K. Foley J. Zambryski P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1685-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). By combining our findings with existing biochemical data (9Yuan Q. Carle A.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 453-462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we suggest that the C-terminal VirB4 hexamer resides in the periplasm directly above an inner membrane-embedded VirB11 hexamer. Plasmid Constructs—Yeast two-hybrid bait fragments VirB1-(residues 8-252), VirB4 (residues 198-401) and (residues 329-650), and VirB11 (residues 1-106) were cloned into our centromere-based yeast two-hybrid vectors pCD.1 and pCD.2, which increase the specificity of yeast two-hybrid interactions (16Durfee T. Draper O. Zupan J. Conklin D.S. Zambryski P.C. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1761-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Yeast two-hybrid prey fragments VirB1 (residues 61-146), VirB4 (residues 329-650), (residues 432-511), (residues 432-522), (residues 443-564), and (residues 520-651), VirB8 (residues 60-237), and VirB10 (residues 155-241) were retrieved from a VirB library fused to the Gal4 activation domain according to the methods described in Ref. 17Ward D.V.

Agrobacterium-expressed regions coding for VirB4 (residues 1-789), (residues 432-789), and (residues 443-789) were cloned into pDW029 with and without an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) linker. pDW029 was constructed to enhance vir-regulated protein expression by fusing the virB promoter to a consensus ribosome binding site. The ribosome binding site sequence and the XhoI and ClaI sites of pBP21 (18Llosa M. Zupan J. Baron C. Zambryski P. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3437-3445Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) were replaced with the ribosome binding site corresponding to A. tumefaciens 16 S ribosomal DNA. In the introduced sequence, 5′-CTCGAGGAGGAGGTTTGTCATGATCGAT-3′, the ribosome binding site is in italics, and a BspHI site spanning the translation initiation codon (bold) is underlined. Protein expression from this promoter is 3-fold higher relative to pBP21, as estimated by green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression. 66 J. R. Zupan, D. V. Ward, C. A. Hackworth, and P. C. Zambryski, unpublished data. Strains and Culture Conditions—A. tumefaciens strains (C58 (wild-type nopaline strain), a GFP-T-DNA C58 derivative (19Tai T.H. Dahlbeck D. Clark E.T. Gajiwala P.

Strains were grown at 28 and 19 °C to increase Vir protein expression. Escherichia coli strains (DH5α and derivatives) were grown at 37 °C on LB with the appropriate antibiotics (Sigma). Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains (YD116 (16Durfee T. Draper O. Zupan J. Conklin D.S. Zambryski P.C. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1761-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and derivatives) were grown at 28 °C on YEPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose) or 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco catalog number 0919-15-3) to which were added amino acid mixes lacking leucine, tryptophan, and/or uracil as appropriate. Antibiotic concentrations (in μg/ml) for A. tumefaciens were: kanamycin 25, tetracycline 10, rifampicin 20, spectinomycin 100, and streptomycin 300. Concentrations for E. coli were: carbenicillin (100), spectinomycin (75), and streptomycin (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar). Protein Expression—Agrobacteria grown on LB agar ± 200 μm acetosyringone were harvested, resuspended in denaturing sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Proteins from 108 cells were loaded into each lane, resolved on Laemmli (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar) or tricine (21von Schagger H. Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar) protein gel systems, and transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride 0.45 μm membranes (Millipore Corporation). Standard protocols for Western blotting were used to detect VirB4 (see below for description of antibodies) or HA-tagged VirB4 constructs. HA-tagged proteins were detected with monoclonal HA.11 antibody (Covance Research Corporation). Fractionation—Cells were fractionated based on the procedure of De Maagd and Lugtenberg (22De Maagd R.A. Lugtenberg B. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 1083-1085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested and resuspended in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 5.5, and then pelleted by centrifugation at 7000 × g. An aliquot of total cells was obtained and frozen in denaturing sample buffer. The remaining cells were resuspended in an osmotic shock solution of 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 20% sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, 87 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 200 μg/ml lysozyme and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The mixture was centrifuged at 7000 × g, and the supernatant (periplasmic fraction) was concentrated by acetone precipitation. The pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 8, containing 87 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and then sonicated. Unbroken cells were pelleted and discarded. The membrane and cytoplasmic fractions were separated by treating the lysate with KCl to a final concentration of 0.2 m and centrifugation at 262,000 × g. The supernatant (cytoplasmic fraction) was concentrated by acetone precipitation. The pellet (membrane fraction) was resuspended in a buffer of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.05 mm EDTA. The samples were boiled in denaturing buffer and quantified by visual inspection of a Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Approximately equal amounts of protein were loaded in each lane of a 10% Laemmli gel (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar), run at 200 V, and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Blots were blocked in a solution of 5% milk in TBST (Tris-buffered saline and Tween 20) and then incubated with primary antibodies. The N-terminal VirB4 antibody is a polyclonal rabbit antibody to the N-terminal 103 amino acid residues of VirB4 (23Kuldau G.A. Plant and Microbial Biology. Ph.D. thesis, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA1991Google Scholar). The C-terminal VirB4 antibody is a polyclonal rabbit antibody to the C-terminal 157 amino acid residues of VirB4 (23Kuldau G.A. Plant and Microbial Biology. Ph.D. thesis, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA1991Google Scholar), which was purified with acetone-powdered (24Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) A. tumefaciens cells that had been cured of their Ti plasmid. Transient Expression Assay—Nicotiana benthamiana plants were greenhouse grown for five to seven weeks. In any one experiment, plants from the same cohort were chosen when leaves were ∼2 cm in diameter. Single colonies of A. tumefaciens were grown for 2 days at 28 °C in 2 ml of liquid LB under selection. 1 ml of the overnight cultures was plated onto LB plates with antibiotics and grown for 2 days at 28 °C. Cells were resuspended and diluted to a final concentration of A600 = 0.6 in a solution containing 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MES, pH 5.5, and 200 μm acetosyringone. The cells were incubated at 19 °C for 3 h prior to infiltration. Six 26-gauge needle holes were made on each N. benthamiana leaf and infiltrated with ∼400 μl of suspension of A. tumefaciens/leaf as described previously (19Tai T.H. Dahlbeck D. Clark E.T. Gajiwala P. Pasion R. Whalen M.C. Stall R.E. Staskawicz B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14153-14158Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The GFP-T-DNA plasmid was a gift from the Staskawicz laboratory and is a derivative of pMD1 (19Tai T.H. Dahlbeck D. Clark E.T. Gajiwala P. Pasion R. Whalen M.C. Stall R.E. Staskawicz B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14153-14158Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) modified to express GFP under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter. Plants were placed at 19 °C for 12-24 h and then transferred to a 22 °C incubator with a 16-h light and 8-h dark cycle. The plants were assayed for GFP expression at different times during a 24-72-h period post-infiltration. 10-18 inoculations were examined/construct/experiment, and experiments were repeated three times. Microscopy and Image Processing—Plant leaves were visualized on a Zeiss Axiophot epifluorescence microscope with a GFP filter set (Chroma Technology Corporation, set number 41017). Half-second exposures were captured through a Roper Quantix camera by the IP Laboratory program (Scanalytics). The color table and brightness levels were adjusted in Adobe Photoshop in a consistent manner across all exposures and experiments. Homology Modeling—We used the model of the monomer of the C terminus of VirB4 (8Middleton R. Sjolander K. Foley J. Zambryski P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1685-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) to create an improved model of the VirB4 hexamer. As previously, each subunit of the VirB4 monomer was aligned to the corresponding subunit of the solved TrwB hexamer structure (Protein Data Bank code 1E9R (11Gomis-Ruth F.X. Moncalian G. Perez-Luque R. Gonzalez A. de la Cabezon E. Cruz F. Coll M. Nature. 2001; 409: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar)). However, instead of using the program Modeler (25Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10561) Google Scholar), here we used the Fit function of the Deep View program (26Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9586) Google Scholar), which led to an emphasis toward resolved residues while de-emphasizing residues with no known coordinates. Models of VirB4 can be accessed at the phylogenomics.berkeley.edu web site. The VirB11 protein sequence from A. tumefaciens was aligned with the HP0525 protein sequence from H. pylori using the alignment given in Yeo et al. (10Yeo H.J. Savvides S.N. Herr A.B. Lanka E. Waksman G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1461-1472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The Modeler program (25Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10561) Google Scholar) was used to build a homology model of two VirB11 subunits based on the structure of two subunits of HP0525 found in the asymmetric unit of the crystal structure of HP0525 bound to ADP (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 1G6O; chains A and B (10Yeo H.J. Savvides S.N. Herr A.B. Lanka E. Waksman G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1461-1472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar)). The hexamer was then assembled by applying crystallographic 3-fold symmetry operators using the program O (27Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar). Molecular images were produced using the UCSF Chimera package from the Resource for Biocomputing, Visualization, and Informatics at the University of California, San Francisco (28Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (28332) Google Scholar). The topology of the C terminus of VirB4 was defined using several experimental approaches. We first present results defining subdomains of protein-protein interactions between VirB4 and other components of the T4SS. As described below, the C terminus of VirB4 interacts with periplasmic domains of several components of the T4SS. The C-terminal Domain of VirB4 Interacts with Periplasmic Proteins—To begin to address VirB4 topology, we defined interactions between the C terminus of VirB4 (residues 329-650) and other components of the T4SS using the yeast two-hybrid system. The C-terminal portion of VirB4 is of particular interest, because it contains a clear structural domain (the TrwB-like domain) with Walker A and B boxes characteristic of many ATPases. Fig. 1 summarizes VirB1-VirB4, VirB8-VirB4, VirB10-VirB4, and VirB11-VirB4 two-hybrid interactions. We previously reported interactions between VirB4 and VirB1, VirB8, VirB10, and VirB11 (17Ward D.V. Draper O. Zupan J.R. Zambryski P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11493-11500Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar); however, (except for the VirB4-VirB8 interaction) the data presented here are derived from new two-hybrid studies that define smaller bait and prey and lead to a finer map of the regions of interaction. Supplemental Fig. 1 describes our two-hybrid analyses using a high resolution prey library corresponding to fusions after every nucleotide of the virB operon and virD4. The high representation of the library defines positive interactions against a highly significant population of negative interactions as controls. The data in Fig. 1A display regions of interaction between two proteins as swaths of lavender and green. When two independent interactions overlap, they are shown as darker swaths of color. These latter regions of overlap then define the minimal regions of interaction between two proteins; these minimal regions are summarized in Fig. 1B. VirB1 has been proposed (29Mushegian A.R. Fullner K.J. Koonin E.V. Nester E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7321-7326Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and now demonstrated to have lytic transglycosylase activity (30Zahrl D. Wagner M. Bischof K. Bayer M. Zavecz B. Beranek A. Ruckenstuhl C. Zarfel G.E. Koraimann G. Microbiology (Read.). 2005; 151: 3455-3467Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) that likely functions in the periplasm to cleave the peptidoglycan layer, allowing localized establishment of other periplasmic T4SS proteins. In support, 1) VirB1 has a signal sequence for transport across the inner membrane via the general secretory pathway, and removal of this sequence abolishes complementation of a virB1 deletion mutant (18Llosa M. Zupan J. Baron C. Zambryski P. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3437-3445Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar); 2) alkaline phosphatase fusions along the length of the VirB1 coding sequence are active (31Beijersbergen A. Smith S.J. Hooykaas P.J. Plasmid. 1994; 32: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 32Das A. Xie Y.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and 3) the VirB1 C-terminal portion VirB1* is exported to the cell surface after periplasmic processing (18Llosa M. Zupan J. Baron C. Zambryski P. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3437-3445Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 33Baron C. Llosa M. Zhou S. Zambryski P.C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1203-1210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous two-hybrid data show multiple VirB1-VirB8 and VirB1-VirB10 interactions (17Ward D.V. Draper O. Zupan J.R. Zambryski P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11493-11500Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) consistent with a periplasmic localization for this subgroup of proteins. Here we have demonstrated reciprocal interactions between VirB1-VirB4 that support periplasmic exposure of the C terminus of VirB4 (Fig. 1A, middle). The interactions of the C terminus of VirB4 with VirB8 and VirB10 further strongly suggest that this region of the VirB4 protein resides in the periplasm. The region of VirB8 interaction (residues 60-237) represents the entire periplasmic domain of VirB8 (9Yuan Q. Carle A. Gao C. Sivanesan D. Aly K.A. Hoppner C. Krall L. Domke N. Baron C. J. Biol.

A. 2006; 103: 2582-2587Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We have also found that VirB4 residues 198-401 interact with the same periplasmic domain of VirB8 (17Ward D.V. Draper O. Zupan J.R. Zambryski P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11493-11500Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar); thus, the minimal VirB8 interaction domain occurs between amino acids 329 and 401 of VirB4 (Fig. 1A, top). Though this region of VirB4 (residues 329-401) has no known structure or function, its interaction with VirB8 supports a periplasmic localization of this portion of the VirB4 protein. Likewise, VirB4 (residues 329-650) interacts with VirB10 (residues 155-241) (Fig. 1A, top), a region that represents a large portion of the VirB10 periplasmic domain (residues 47-377) (9Yuan Q. Carle A. Gao C. Sivanesan D. Aly K.A. Hoppner C. Krall L. Domke N. Baron C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26349-26359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 31Beijersbergen A.

A. 2004; 101: 17228-17233Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Thus, both VirB4-VirB8 and VirB4-VirB10 interactions support the assignment of the VirB4 C-terminal domain to the periplasm. Further evidence for a periplasmic location of the C terminus of VirB4 is its interaction with the N terminus of VirB11 (Fig. 1A, bottom). The orientation of the solved structure of the VirB11 homolog HP0525 from H. pylori (10Yeo H.J. Savvides S.N. Herr A.B. Lanka E. Waksman G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1461-1472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) predicts that VirB11 resides in the inner membrane with its N terminus facing the periplasm and its C terminus facing the cytoplasm. The Agrobacterium VirB11-VirB4 interaction is analyzed in detail below. Homology Model of VirB11 Based on H. pylori HP0525—To test whether two-hybrid data can be used to determine how full-length T4SS proteins interact in the cell, we analyzed two-hybrid interacting domains and structural data to predict the three-dimensional relationship between VirB4 and VirB11. Because the structures of VirB4 and VirB11 are unknown, we first needed to build homology models of these proteins. A structure of VirB11 was predicted using bioinformatics approaches similar to those utilized to create a homology model of the VirB4 C terminus (8Middleton R. Sjolander K. Foley J. Zambryski P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1685-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Our VirB11 homology model is based on HP0525 from H. pylori, which shares 31% amino acid identity (and 52% similarity over 301 aligned residues) with A. tumefaciens VirB11. Two subunits of HP0525 were found in the asymmetric unit of its crystal structure (10Yeo H.J. Savvides S.N. Herr A.B. Lanka E. Waksman G. Mo"
https://openalex.org/W2033452173,"Protein kinase CK2 is a ubiquitous protein kinase that can phosphorylate various proteins involved in central cellular processes, such as signal transduction, cell division, and proliferation. We have shown that the human nucleolar phosphoprotein p140 (hNopp140) is able to regulate the catalytic activity of CK2. Unphosphorylated hNopp140 and phospho-hNopp140 bind to the regulatory and catalytic subunits of CK2, respectively, and the interaction between hNopp140 and CK2 was prevented by inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6). Phosphorylation of α-casein, genimin, or human phosphatidylcholine transfer protein-like protein by CK2 was inhibited by hNopp140, and InsP6 recovered the suppressed activity of CK2 by hNopp140. These observations indicated that hNopp140 serves as a negative regulator of CK2 and that InsP6 stimulates the activity of CK2 by blocking the interaction between hNopp140 and CK2.

Phosphorylation of α-casein, genimin, or human phosphatidylcholine transfer protein-like protein by CK2 was inhibited by hNopp140, and InsP6 recovered the suppressed activity of CK2 by hNopp140. These observations indicated that hNopp140 serves as a negative regulator of CK2 and that InsP6 stimulates the activity of CK2 by blocking the interaction between hNopp140 and CK2. The protein kinase CK2, formerly known as casein kinase II, is a serine/threonine protein kinase that has been found in virtually all tissues and cell lines and is responsible for the phosphorylation of more than 300 cellular proteins (1Meggio F. Pinna L.A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 349-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). The cellular function of CK2 is related to essential processes such as cell cycle, proliferation, or signal transduction since the proteins phosphorylated by CK2 are involved in DNA replication and transcription, translation, and signal transduction (2Henriksson M. Luscher B. Adv. Cancer Res. 1996; 68: 109-182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Lin A. Frost J. Deng T. Smeal T. al-Alawi N. Kikkawa U. Hunter T. Brenner D. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 777-789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Although the activity of CK2 is observed ubiquitously, unregulated CK2 has been correlated with cell transformation. Elevated levels of CK2 have been observed in transformed cells (6Boldyreff B. Meggio F. Pinna L.A. Issinger O.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 7Ahmed K. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 1-11PubMed Google Scholar) and a wide variety of tumors (8Tawfic S. Yu S. Wang H. Faust R. Davis A. Ahmed K. Histol. Histopathol. 2001; 16: 573-582PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, expression of the catalytic subunit of CK2 in transgenic mice as well as the altered expression of CK2 in p53 deficiency conditions have been shown to induce lymphomas (9Seldin D.C. Leder P. Science. 1995; 267: 894-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 10Landesman-Bollag E. Channavajhala P.L. Cardiff R.D. Seldin D.C. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2965-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), suggesting that CK2 plays a role in neoplastic growth (8Tawfic S. Yu S. Wang H. Faust R. Davis A. Ahmed K. Histol. Histopathol. 2001; 16: 573-582PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the recognition of many viral proteins as targets of CK2 indicates that CK2-dependent activation of viral proteins may be essential to the viral life cycle (11Pinna L.A. Meggio F. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1997; 3: 77-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Because of the involvement of CK2 in these processes, CK2 is considered a potential target for anti-neoplastic and anti-infectious agents (12Sarno S. Moro S. Meggio F. Zagotto G. Dal Ben D. Ghisellini P. Battistutta R. Zanotti G. Pinna L.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 2002; 93: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). CK2 is a holoenzyme that consists of two catalytic subunits (α or α′) and two regulatory subunits (β). The crystal structure of the CK2 holoenzyme (α2β2) showed that the two catalytic subunits each interact with a central dimer formed by the regulatory subunits and make no direct contact with one another (13Niefind K. Guerra B. Ermakowa I. Issinger O.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5320-5331Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The regulatory subunit dimer appears to regulate CK2 activity either by direct modulation of the activity of catalytic subunit (14Guerra B. Boldyreff B. Sarno S. Cesaro L. Issinger O.G. Pinna L.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 15Cochet C. Chambaz E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1403-1406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by altering the substrate specificity of the catalytic subunit (16Meggio F. Boldyreff B. Marin O. Pinna L.A. Issinger O.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The regulatory machinery controlling CK2 in the cell is poorly understood. The cellular activity of CK2 appears to be independent of either the typical secondary messengers or phosphorylation (17Guerra B. Issinger O.G. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 391-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Several proteins that could interact with CK2 and affect the activity of the enzyme have been identified. Among these proteins, the FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) complex (3Keller D.M. Zeng X. Wang Y. Zhang Q.H. Kapoor M. Shu H. Goodman R. Lozano G. Zhao Y. Lu H. Mol.

Gorbsky G.J. Litchfield D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23054-23064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) were shown to modulate CK2 substrate specificity. In addition, the tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) 2The abbreviations used are: APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; InsP6, d-myo-inositol 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate; InsP4, d-myo-inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate; InsP5, d-myo-inositol 1,2,3,4,5-pentakisphosphate; h-, human; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PCTP, phosphatidylcholine transfer protein. 2The abbreviations used are: APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; InsP6, d-myo-inositol 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate; InsP4, d-myo-inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate; InsP5, d-myo-inositol 1,2,3,4,5-pentakisphosphate; h-, human; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PCTP, phosphatidylcholine transfer protein. binds to the catalytic subunit of CK2 and suppresses CK2 activity (20Homma M.K. Li D. Krebs E.G. Yuasa Y. Homma Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5959-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Small molecules that can regulate CK2 activity have also been characterized. Polyanions, such as heparin, inhibit CK2 (21Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1991; 23: 123-164PubMed Google Scholar), where as polycations, such as spermine or polylysine, moderately activate the enzyme (22Leroy D. Heriche J.K. Filhol O. Chambaz E.M. Cochet C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20820-20827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 23Sarno S. Marin O. Meggio F. Pinna L.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Recently, highly phosphorylated forms of inositols were shown to regulate the activity of CK2. Inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6) stimulated the catalytic activity of CK2 in cell extracts or in partially purified fraction of CK2 by 2-3-fold but failed to activate purified recombinant CK2 (24Solyakov L. Cain K. Tracey B.M. Jukes R. Riley A.M. Potter B.V. Tobin A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43403-43410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), suggesting that the cell extracts contain an unidentified negative regulator whose inhibitory activity was blocked by InsP6. One of the proteins that can interact with CK2 is hNopp140, a nucleolar phosphoprotein (25Kim Y.K. Jin Y. Vukoti K.M. Park J.K. Kim E.E. Lee K.J. Yu Y.G. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 31: 260-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). It can be highly phosphorylated by CK2, and the cellular function of hNopp140 is related to both the biogenesis of the nucleolus and the cell cycle (26Meier U.T. Blobel G. Cell. 1992; 70: 127-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In this study we investigated the interaction between hNopp140 and CK2 and demonstrated that hNopp140 could negatively regulate the catalytic activity of CK2. Furthermore, we showed that InsP6 abolished the negative regulation of CK2 by hNopp140. These findings provide insight into the roles of hNopp140 and phosphoinositides in CK2 regulation. Materials—Protein kinase CK2 was purchased from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). d-myo-Inositol 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate (InsP6), d-myo-inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (InsP4), d-myo-inositol 1,2,3,4,5-pentakisphosphate (InsP5), d-myo-inositol 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakissulfate, and α-casein were obtained from Calbiochem and Sigma, respectively. Polyclonal antibodies against hNopp140 were prepared from mice immunized with purified hNopp140. Anti-GST, anti-CK2α, and anti-CK2β antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. All other consumables were of reagent grade. Plasmid Construction and Protein Purification—Recombinant hNopp140 was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and purified as previously described (25Kim Y.K. Jin Y. Vukoti K.M. Park J.K. Kim E.E. Lee K.J. Yu Y.G. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 31: 260-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The DNA fragments encoding human CK2α and CK2β subunits were amplified by PCR from the pT7-CK2α and pT7-CK2β plasmids, respectively, which were kindly provided by Prof. Young-Seuk Bae (Kyungpook National University). The amplified DNA fragments were inserted into the cloning sites of the pGEX-4T1 vector, producing GST-CK2α and GST-CK2β, in which CK2α or CK2β was fused at the C terminus of GST. The plasmids were then transformed into E. coli DH5α, and the expression of GST-CK2α or GST-CK2β was induced using 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 37°C in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Harvested E. coli cells were lysed using a micro fluidizer, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min. The crude extract was loaded onto a GST-agarose column, and bound proteins were eluted with 20 mm reduced glutathione in PBS (137 mm NaCl, 27 mm KCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 2 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4). For preparation of CK2α or CK2β, the isolated GST-CK2α or GST-CK2β was cleaved with thrombin, and CK2α or CK2β were further purified by anion exchange chromatography using a Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences). The cDNA encoding human genimin or PCTP-like protein was amplified by PCR from a human fetal brain cDNA library and inserted into the NdeI and EcoRI cloning sites (New England Biolabs) of pET28a (Novagen) or the HindIII and XhoI cloning sites of the pET21a vector (Novagen) to generate an expression vector for geminin or PCTP-like protein, respectively. The expressions of recombinant His-tagged geminin or PCTP-like protein in E. coli BL21(DE3) were induced using 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the expressed proteins were purified using nickel nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. Protein Phosphorylation—CK2-mediated protein phosphorylation assays were performed by incubating 6 μg of substrate protein with 15 units of CK2 in 20 μl of reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm ATP, pH 7.5) containing 1 μm [γ-32P]ATP (100 cpm pmol-1) at 30 °C for20 min. To prepare phospho-hNopp140, purified recombinant hNopp140 was incubated with CK2 in 100 μl of reaction buffer at 30 °C for 16 h. Quantification of the protein bands detected by autoradiography was performed using FUJIX BAS 2000 phosphorimaging (Fuji, Japan). GST Pulldown Assay—Unphosphorylated hNopp140 or phospho-hNopp140 (2 μg) were mixed with 1 μg GST-CK2α and/or GST-CK2β in PBST (PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20) at 4 °C for 2 h, then further incubated with 20 μl of GST-agarose beads (50% suspension) (Peptron, Korea). After washing the beads 5 times with PBST, the proteins bound to the resin were eluted by adding 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. The proteins on the gel were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk for 1 h, reacted with 0.2 μg/ml mouse anti-hNopp140 antibodies in PBST for 1 h, and then incubated with 0.1 μg/ml sheep anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase for 1 h. After successive washes with PBST, immunoblots were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Pierce) as described in the manufacturer's instruction manual. Cell Culture and Transfection—The cDNA encoding hNopp140, flanked by BamHI and SalI restriction sites, was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCMV-Tag3B (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to generate pCMV-hNopp140, which expressed a full-length hNopp140 with a Myc tag at the N terminus. For transformation, 293T cells were grown in 10-cm-diameter Petri dishes and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Sub-confluent cells were transiently transfected with pCMV-hNopp140 DNA (4 μg/dish) mixed with the Lipofectamine PLUS reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were harvested ∼48 h after transfection. Immunoprecipitation—Harvested cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% protease inhibitor mixture, pH 7.4) for 2 h at 4 °C, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The cell lysate was incubated with 1 μg of anti-hNopp140 antibodies in lysis buffer at 4 °C for 2 h. After incubation with protein G-Plus agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h, the mixture was centrifuged for 10 s, and the supernatant was removed. After washing the agarose beads five times with lysis buffer, the proteins bound to the beads were eluted by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins in the gel were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and visualized with specific antibodies using an ECL-chemiluminescence method (Pierce) as described in the manufacturer's protocol. hNopp140 Inhibits the Catalytic Activity of CK2—The effect of hNopp140 on the catalytic activity of CK2 was examined in vitro using α-casein as a substrate. Phosphorylation of α-casein by the CK2 holoenzyme was significantly reduced as the concentration of unphosphorylated hNopp140 increased (Fig. 1A). The activity of CK2 decreased to 40% of the control level in the presence of an equimolar ratio of hNopp140 and further decreased to 20% of control in the presence of 0.7 μm hNopp140 (Fig. 1C). Because hNopp140 is a substrate of CK2 (26Meier U.T. Blobel G. Cell. 1992; 70: 127-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), the inhibitory activity of phospho-hNopp140 was examined to eliminate the effects of competitive inhibition that might be caused by the presence of unphosphorylated hNopp140 as an alternative substrate. As shown in Fig. 1, B and C, phospho-hNopp140 is as effective in inhibiting the activity of CK2 as unphosphorylated hNopp140. The inhibitory activity of hNopp140 on CK2 was also tested using geminin, a regulator of eukaryotic DNA replication (27McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1998; 93: 1043-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) and a substrate of CK2 (28Kulartz M. Hiller E. Kappes F. Pinna L.A. Knippers R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 1011-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1D, recombinant geminin was effectively phosphorylated by CK2, and the CK2-dependent phosphorylation was significantly reduced in the presence of hNopp140 (Fig. 1D), although the inhibitory effect of hNopp140 was weaker than those with α-casein as substrate. Specific Interaction between hNopp140 and CK2 Is Modulated by Phosphorylation—To dissect the interaction between hNopp140 and CK2, binding of the catalytic and regulatory subunits of CK2, GST-CK2α or GST-CK2β, respectively, to phospho-hNopp140 or unphosphorylated hNopp140 was examined. When GST-CK2α was incubated with hNopp140 and precipitated with glutathione beads, only phospho-hNopp140 co-precipitated with CK2α. In contrast, GST-CK2β was not able to bind phospho-hNopp140 but did bind to unphosphorylated hNopp140 (Fig. 2). These results indicate that hNopp140 binding to the different subunits of CK2 depended on its phosphorylation state; phospho-hNopp140 binds to CK2α, and unphosphorylated hNopp140 binds to CK2β. Because hNopp140 is highly phosphorylated in cell extracts (26Meier U.T. Blobel G. Cell. 1992; 70: 127-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), hNopp140 would normally bind to the catalytic subunit of CK2 and repress its catalytic activity. To investigate whether hNopp140 could affect the assembly of CK2 subunits, the interaction between CK2α and GST-CK2β was measured in the presence of hNopp140. Complex formation of the two subunits of CK2 was verified by co-precipitation of CK2α with GST-CK2β (Fig. 3, second and third lanes). In the presence of excess unphosphorylated hNopp140, the level of CK2α bound to GST-CK2β was unchanged (Fig. 3, third and fourth lanes). Similarly, phosphohNopp140 failed to disrupt the interaction between CK2α and GST-CK2β (data not shown). These results indicate that hNopp140 was not able to disrupt the assembly of CK2 subunits. Thus, the inhibition of CK2 by hNopp140 might be due to reduced accessibility of substrate proteins to the active site of CK2 or induction a conformational change to a less active state. The Repressed Activity of CK2 by hNopp140 Is Stimulated by InsP6—Previously, CK2-dependent phosphorylation of PCTP-like protein was shown to be repressed by an unidentified factor(s), and the repressed CK2 activity was stimulated in the presence of inositol polyphosphates such as InsP6 (24Solyakov L. Cain K. Tracey B.M. Jukes R. Riley A.M. Potter B.V. Tobin A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43403-43410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To test whether inositol polyphosphates could stimulate the repressed activity of CK2 by hNopp140, the activity of CK2 in the presence of inositol polyphosphates InsP4, InsP5, InsP6, and d-myo-inositol 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakissulfate was examined using α-casein or human PCTP-like protein as substrates. When α-casein was used as substrate, InsP6 hardly affected the activity of CK2 in the absence of hNopp140 (Fig. 4A). However, the reduced activity of CK2 by hNopp140 was recovered as the concentration of InsP6 increased, and the inhibitory activity of hNopp140 was no longer observed at 10 μm or higher concentration of InsP6 (Fig. 4A). The abilities of various inositol phosphates to stimulate the repressed CK2 activity by hNopp140 were further tested using α-casein as substrate. It was found that InsP6 among the tested inositol phosphates showed highest stimulatory activity, whereas InsP4, InsP5, or d-myo-inositol 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakissulfate showed little stimulatory activities (Fig. 4B). The inhibitory effect of hNopp140 and the stimulatory activity of inositol phosphates on the CK2-dependent phosphorylation of human PCTP-like protein were tested with purified recombinant protein. The phosphorylation of PCTP-like protein by CK2 was significantly reduced in the presence of hNopp140 (Fig. 4C, first and second lanes). The reduced activity of CK2 by hNopp140 was significantly increased in the presence of 25 μm InsP6. In contrast, InsP4, InsP5,or d-myo-inositol 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakissulfate showed little stimulatory effect on the repressed CK2 activity (Fig. 4C). Likewise, the reduced CK2-dependent phosphorylation of geminin by hNopp140 was also stimulated by InsP6 (Fig. 4D). However, the relative stimulatory effects of various inositol phosphates were not clearly observed due to the marginal difference of the phosphorylation level in the presence or absence of hNopp140 (data not shown). These results indicated that InsP6 regulates CK2 by stimulating the repressed activity of CK2 by hNopp140, and the InsP6-dependent regulatory property of hNopp140 was well matched to the unidentified cellular factor that regulated CK2 in InsP6-dependent manner (24Solyakov L. Cain K. Tracey B.M. Jukes R. Riley A.M. Potter B.V. Tobin A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43403-43410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). InsP6 Inhibits the Interaction between hNopp140 and CK2— The binding affinity of hNopp140 to CK2 and the InsP6-dependent stimulation of hNopp140-repressed CK2 activity suggested that InsP6 might interfere the interaction between hNopp140 and CK2. The effect of InsP6 on this interaction was examined by measuring the amount of hNopp140 bound to GST-CK2α or GST-CK2β in the presence or absence of InsP6 using a GST pulldown assay. Phospho-hNopp140 did not co-precipitate with GST-CK2α when the proteins were incubated in the presence of 25 μm InsP6 (Fig. 5A). In contrast, the binding of unphosphorylated hNopp140 to GST-CK2β was only slightly reduced by InsP6. We further tested the effect of InsP6 on the interaction between hNopp140 and CK2 in cell extracts by immunoprecipitation using anti-hNopp140 antibodies and immunoblotting using anti-CK2α antibodies or anti-hNopp140 antibodies. When proteins in the cell extract were precipitated with anti-hNopp140 antibodies in the absence or presence of InsP6, equal amounts of hNopp140 were observed (Fig. 5B, lower panel). However, the amount of CK2α co-precipitating with hNopp140 decreased to 20-30% of the control in the presence of 25 μm InsP6 (Fig. 5B, upper panel). These results indicate that InsP6 stimulated the activity of CK2 by blocking the interaction between hNopp140 and CK2a. In this study we have shown that hNopp140 can bind to and negatively regulate CK2. Moreover, InsP6 was shown to stimulate hNopp140 repressed CK2 by blocking the interaction between hNopp140 and CK2. Previously, Li et al. (29Li D. Meier U.T. Dobrowolska G. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3773-3779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) showed that mouse Nopp140 in extracts of 3T3 cells bound primarily to the regulatory subunit of CK2 and that a CK2α interacted only marginally with hNopp140). In the current study hNopp140 interacted with both subunits of CK2 depending on the phosphorylation state of hNopp140. CK2α interacted preferentially with the highly phosphorylated form of hNopp140 and CK2β with the unphosphorylated form. The weak binding affinity between mouse Nopp140 and CK2α in 3T3 cell extracts could be due to a low level of phosphorylation of mouse Nopp140. Alternatively, mouse and human Nopp140 might have different binding affinities for CK2 subunits depending on their level of phosphorylation. Binding of hNopp140 to CK2 significantly reduced the catalytic activity of CK2 and the degree of hNopp140 inhibition of CK2 depended on the substrate. Phosphorylation of PCTP-like protein or α-casein by CK2 was effectively inhibited by hNopp140 (Fig. 1), suggesting that the binding of hNopp140 may restrict the substrate proteins to access to the active site of CK2. On the other hand, it was reported that the phosphorylation of the acidic peptide DSD (amino acid sequence RRRDDDSDDD) by CK2 was only marginally affected by hNopp140 (29Li D. Meier U.T. Dobrowolska G. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3773-3779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The reduced inhibitory effect of hNopp140 on CK2-dependent phosphorylation of peptide substrate may be due to the highly flexible conformation, which could be more easily accessible to the active site. Thus, hNopp140 appears to restrict the access of a certain set of substrate proteins such as α-casein or PCTP-like protein (24Solyakov L. Cain K. Tracey B.M. Jukes R. Riley A.M. Potter B.V. Tobin A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43403-43410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) to the CK2 active site but fails to affect the accessibility of small or flexible substrates such as the DSD peptide. The interaction between hNopp140 and CK2 was modulated by InsP6. Inositol polyphosphates such as InsP6 are found in mammalian cells in micromolar concentrations (30Pittet D. Schlegel W. Lew D.P. Monod A. Mayr G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18489-18493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Szwergold B.S. Graham R.A. Brown T.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 874-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Although the biological functions of inositol polyphosphates are poorly understood, they are implicated in several aspects of cell regulation such as vesicle trafficking (32Saiardi A. Sciambi C. McCaffery J.M. Wendland B. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14206-14211Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), DNA repair (33Luo H.R. Saiardi A. Yu H. Nagata E. Ye K. Snyder S.H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2509-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and chromatin remodeling (34Rando O.J. Chi T.H. Crabtree G.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the cellular concentration of InsP6 fluctuates at least 3-fold during the cell cycle (35Barker C.J. Wright J. Hughes P.J. Kirk C.J. Michell R.H. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), implying that InsP6 has an important role in cell cycle progression. When the cellular levels of InsP6 increase during cell division, CK2 may dissociate from hNopp140 and become fully activated. The increased level of InsP6 in mitotic cells (36Guse A.H. Greiner E. Emmrich F. Brand K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7129-7133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the high level of CK2 activity in proliferating cells support the coordinated regulation of CK2 by InsP6 and hNopp140 during cell growth. Tobin and co-workers (24Solyakov L. Cain K. Tracey B.M. Jukes R. Riley A.M. Potter B.V. Tobin A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43403-43410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) demonstrated the presence of an InsP6-dependent negative regulator of CK2. In their investigation, InsP6 only slightly affected the catalytic activity of purified CK2 but stimulated CK2 activity 2-3-fold when the enzyme had been repressed by unidentified heat stable cellular factor(s) (24Solyakov L.

These properties of the unknown negative regulator are well in agreement with those of hNopp140, including its high thermostability (25Kim Y.K. Jin Y. Vukoti K.M. Park J.K. Kim E.E. Lee K.J. Yu Y.G. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 31: 260-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that CK2 forms a complex with hNopp140 at low concentrations of InsP6, and the activity of hNopp140-bound CK2 is reduced 4-5-fold compared with that of free CK2. Even in this repressed state, however, flexible substrates or small peptides can be efficiently phosphorylated by CK2. This state of CK2 may be responsible for the basal and constitutive activities observed in resting cells. We also examined whether hNopp140 could negatively regulate the CK2-dependent phosphorylation of proteins other than PCTP-like protein using geminin, a regulator of eukaryotic DNA replication (27McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1998; 93: 1043-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) and a substrate of CK2 (28Kulartz M. Hiller E. Kappes F. Pinna L.A. Knippers R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 1011-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Unlike PCTP-like protein, the phosphorylation of geminin by CK2 was only slightly inhibited by hNopp140 (Fig. 1), although the slightly reduced phosphorylation was alleviated by InsP6 (Fig. 4), implying that the degree of repressed CK2 activity by hNopp140 depends on the nature of substrate proteins. It should be noted that inositol pyrophosphates such as InsP7 could specifically phosphorylate hNopp140 in a non-enzymatic way (37Saiardi A. Bhandari R. Resnick A.C. Snowman A.M. Snyder S.H. Science. 2004; 306: 2101-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). This property of hNopp140 along with the stimulatory effect of InsP6 on the activity of CK2 repressed by hNopp140 suggested a coordinated regulation mechanism of inositol polyphosphates on the cellular function of hNopp140. Recently, the APC protein was identified as a negative regulator of CK2. APC binds CK2 and inhibits the catalytic activity of CK2 (20Homma M.K. Li D. Krebs E.G. Yuasa Y. Homma Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5959-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Co-transfection experiments with fragments of APC and CK2 revealed that a small region (amino acids 2086-2394) at the C terminus of APC, which consists of 2843 amino acids, strongly inhibited CK2. Although the CK2 regulatory regions of APC and hNopp140 are both negative regulators of CK2, they showed no apparent sequence homology (data not shown). It is noticeable, however, that both hNopp140 and the CK2 regulatory region of APC have a high percentage of lysine and serine residues, ∼15-17%. This characteristic may underlie their binding to CK2. However, the APC fragment effectively inhibited the phosphorylation of peptide substrates, suggesting that APC regulation of CK2 differs from that of hNopp140. In summary, we have identified hNopp140 as an InsP6-dependent negative regulator of CK2. The coordinated regulation of CK2 by InsP6 and hNopp140 could control the range of CK2 activity from basal to highly activated level. This regulatory mechanism controls phosphorylation of a subgroup of CK2 substrates rather than all possible CK2 substrates. Identification of CK2 substrates whose phosphorylation is regulated by hNopp140 will elucidate the significance of hNopp140 on its regulation of CK2."
https://openalex.org/W2044009184,"Different members of the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup>+K<sup>+</sup> exchanger (NCKX) family are present in distinct brain regions, suggesting that they may have cell-specific functions. Many neuronal channels and transporters are regulated via phosphorylation. Regulation of the rat brain NCKXs by protein kinases, however, has not been described. Here, we report an increase in NCKX2 activity in response to protein kinase C (PKC) activation. Outward current of NCKX2 heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells was enhanced by β-phorbol dibutyrate (PDBu), whereas PDBu had little effect on activity of NCKX3 or NCKX4. The PDBu-induced enhancement (PIE) of NCKX2 activity was abolished by PKC inhibitors and significantly reduced when the dominant negative mutant of PKCϵ (K437R) was overexpressed. Moreover, PDBu accelerated the decay rate of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient at the calyx of Held, where NCKX is the major Ca<sup>2+</sup>-clearance mechanism. Intracellular perfusion with alkaline phosphatase completely inhibited PIE. Consistently, β-phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), but not 4α-PMA, induced a 3-fold stimulation of <sup>32</sup>P incorporation into NCKX2 expressed in HEK293 cells. To investigate the sites involved, PIE of wild-type NCKX2 was compared with mutant NCKX2 in which the three putative PKC consensus sites were replaced with alanine, either individually or in combination. Double-site mutation involving Thr-476 (T166A/T476A and T476A/S504A) disrupted PIE, whereas single mutation of Thr-166, Thr-476, or Ser-504 or the double mutant T166A/S504A failed to completely prevent PIE. These findings suggest that PKC-mediated activation of NCKX2 is sensitive to mutation of multiple PKC consensus sites via a mechanism that may involve several phosphorylation events."

We found previously that interleukin-2, a lymphocyte-activation cytokine, induces P-glycoprotein expression on lymphocytes. Lymphocyte activation involves adhesion with the extracellular matrix, such as hyaluronan, through adhesion molecules on lymphocytes. We investigated the transcriptional regulation of MDR-1 in lymphocytes by fragmented hyaluronan. Fragmented hyaluronan (especially the 6.9-kDa form), not native high molecular hyaluronan, induced translocation of YB-1, a specific transcriptional factor for MDR-1, from the cytoplasm into the nucleus and resulted in the transcription of MDR-1 and the expression of P-glycoprotein on lymphocytes in a dose-dependent manner. Transfection of YB-1 antisense oligonucleotides inhibited P-glycoprotein expression induced by fragmented hyaluronan. The fragmented hyaluronan induced significant P-glycoprotein expression on only activated CD4+ T cells, which highly expressed CD69, and resulted in excretion of intracellular dexamethasone added in vitro. Cyclosporin A, a competitive P-glycoprotein inhibitor, restored intracellular dexamethasone levels in CD4+ T cells. Anti-CD44 monoclonal antibody (Hermes-1) inhibited fragmented hyaluronan-induced YB-1 activation and P-glycoprotein expression in CD4+ T cells. We provide the first evidence that binding of fragmented hyaluronan to CD44 induces YB-1 activation followed by P-glycoprotein expression in accordance with activation of CD4+ T cells.

In various tumor cell lines, we and others have reported that transcription of MDR-1 is directly regulated by the human Y box-binding protein-1 (YB-1), an MDR-1 transcription factor, and that activation of YB-1 is induced in response to genotoxic stresses including multiple drugs (14Ohga T.

In lymphocytes, our group reported previously that the transcription of MDR-1 gene and expression of P-glycoprotein are induced by soluble factors including lymphocyte-activation cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-2, resulting in the activation of YB-1 and induction of its binding to DNA (13Tsujimura S. Saito K. Nakayamada S. Nakano K. Tsukada J. Kohno K. Tanaka Y. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition to soluble factors, intercellular adhesion or adhesion to the extracellular matrix transduces signals via functional molecules on lymphocytes and these processes are involved in the regulation of immunological reactions (16Sturm A.

FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2292-2299Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Hyaluronan, a representative component of extracellular matrix, is a nonsulfated glycosaminoglycan bearing linear repeats of disaccharide-β-d-glucuronyl-β-d-N-acetylglucosamine (18Sugahara K. Schwartz N.B. Dorfman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6252-6261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The principal known receptor of hyaluronan is CD44 (19Aruffo A. Stamenkovic I. Melnick M. Underhill C.B. Seed B. Cell. 1990; 61: 1303-1313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar). CD44 is a 90-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein widely distributed on T lymphocytes, granulocytes, monocytes, fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and epithelial cells (20Underhill C. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 293-298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stimulation of CD44 with hyaluronan plays a role in various physiological functions, such as cell-cell adhesion, cell-substrate interactions, and lymphocyte recruitment, as well as pathological processes such as chronic inflammation and metastasis of malignant cells (19Aruffo A. Stamenkovic I. Melnick M. Underhill C.B. Seed B. Cell. 1990; 61: 1303-1313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar). Hyaluronan is usually generated as a high molecular weight polymer, a native hyaluronan (18Sugahara K. Schwartz N.B. Dorfman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6252-6261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but a fragmented hyaluronan, a digested low molecular weight oligomer, is detected in certain pathological conditions, such as inflammation and tumors (21Balazs E.A.

Several studies have reported that the biological activities of fragmented hyaluronan markedly differ from native hyaluronan in endothelial cell, various malignant cells, and macrophages (23Lokeshwar V.B. Rubinowicz D. Schroeder G.L. Forgacs E. Minna J.D. Block N.L. Nadji M. Lokeshwar B.L. J. Biol.

Although MDR-1 transcription in lymphocytes is induced by various activation stimuli such as cytokines, there is little information on whether stimulation with hyaluronan induces activation and MDR-1 transcription in resting CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, it is also not clear at present whether the effect of fragmented hyaluronan on activation and regulation of MDR1 are different from native hyaluronan in CD4+ T cells. The present study was designed to determine the effects of fragmented hyaluronan on CD4+ T cell activation and its role in P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance, particularly in fragmented hyaluronan-rich microenvironments such as areas of chronic inflammation or tumors. Isolation of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells from Healthy Donors—We isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors by density gradient centrifugation using Lymphocyte Separation Medium 50494 (GE Healthcare) as described previously (27Tanaka Y. Minami Y. Mine S. Hirano H. Hu C.D. Fujimoto H. Fujii K. Saito K. Tsukada J. van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Kataoka T. Eto S. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6209-6216PubMed Google Scholar, 28Tanaka Y. Wake A.

We confirmed that purified PBMCs contained more than 90% of lymphocytes (CD4, CD8, or CD20 positive cells) and less than 10% of CD14 positive monocytes by immunostaining. The study was approved by the Human Subject Research Committee of the University of Occupational and Environmental Health, School of Medicine, and informed consent was obtained from all donors who enrolled in the study. CD4+ T Cells Isolation from PBMCs—CD4+ T cells were purified by negative selection using magnetic beads according to the recommended procedure supplied by the manufacturer (CD4 negative isolation kit; Dynal Biotech, Japan). The purity of the CD4+ T cell subset was determined by flow cytometry to be greater than 90%. Reagents and mAbs—Fragmented (1.7, 6.9, and 40 kDa) and native (950 kDa) hyaluronan were kindly donated by the Tokyo Research Institute of Seikagaku (Tokyo, Japan). The following monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were used as purified Ig in preparation of staining and analysis of cell surface or cytoplasmic molecules, blocking of CD44, and Western blotting analysis.

Flow Cytometric Analysis—Staining and flow cytometric analysis of PBMCs or CD4+ T cells were conducted by standard procedures as described previously using a FACScan (BD Biosciences) (27Tanaka Y. Minami Y. Mine S. Hirano H. Hu C.D. Fujimoto H. Fujii K. Saito K. Tsukada J. van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Kataoka T. Eto S. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6209-6216PubMed Google Scholar, 28Tanaka Y. Wake A.

Briefly, PBMCs or CD4+ cells (2 × 105 cells/well) were initially incubated with polyclonal γ-globulin (10 μg/ml, Yoshitomi Pharmaceutical Co.) for blocking of Fc receptors and then incubated with MRK-16, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG Ab in FACS medium consisting of phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% human serum albumin, and 0.2% NaN3 (Sigma). For the two-color analysis, we incubated PBMCs with CyChrome-conjugated CD4 mAb, CD8 mAb, or CD4+ cells with phycoerythrin-conjugated CD69 mAb after blocking of free anti-mouse IgG-binding sites with irrelevant antibodies. Monoclonal antibody two-color-stained cells were detected by electronic gating based on their CD4, CD8, or CD69 expression using a FACScan. Amplification of mAb binding was provided by a three-decade logarithmic amplifier. Quantification of the cell surface antigens on one cell was performed using QIFIKIT beads (Dako, Kyoto, Japan) as reported previously (27Tanaka Y. Minami Y. Mine S. Hirano H. Hu C.D. Fujimoto H.

The data were used to construct the calibration curve of mean fluorescence intensity versus antibody binding capacity. The cell specimen was analyzed on the FACScan and the antibody binding capacity calculated by interpolation on the calibration curve. When the green fluorescence laser detection was set at 500 nm in the FACScan, the antibody binding capacity was equal to (202.98 × exp (0.0092 × mean fluorescence intensity), (R2 = 0.9995)). Subsequently, the specific antibody binding capacity was obtained after correcting for the background, and apparent antibody binding capacity of the negative control anti-mouse IgG Ab. The specific antibody binding capacity is the mean number of accessible antigenic sites per cell, referred to as antigen density and expressed in sites/cell. Immunostaining and Confocal Microscopy Analysis—PBMCs or CD4+ T cells were plated onto a 12-well culture dish (2 × 105 cells/well) and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 50 μg/ml 6.9-kDa fragmented hyaluronan in RPMI 1640 containing 5% fetal calf serum. The cells were then treated with 4% formaldehyde (Sigma) in FACS medium for 15 min and then with 0.1% saponin (Sigma) in FACS medium. The obtained cells were incubated with a specific antibody against YB-1 for 30 min at 4 °C. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG Ab at saturating concentrations in FACS medium. We performed confocal analysis of YB-1 using a LSM 5-pascal inverted laser scan microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscope Systems, Germany). Gel Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts from PBMCs were prepared as described previously (11Cordon-Cardo C. O'Brien J.P. Casals D. Rittman-Grauer L. Biedler J.L. Melamed M.R. Bertino J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 695-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar) and then incubated with or without 50 μg/ml 6.9-kDa fragmented hyaluronan. In the next step, 4 μg of nuclear protein were preincubated for 20 min at room temperature in 15 μl of buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 4% glycerol, and 40 mm NaCl) containing 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) (GE Healthcare) and a 32P-end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the YB-1 consensus binding site (5′-GGGCAGTTTTAGCCAGCTCCTCCCTA-3′, 5′-GGGGTAGGGAGGAGCTGGCTAAAACT-3′) as described previously (30Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9149) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures were electrophoresed on 4% polyacrylamide gels in 0.25× TAE buffer. Transfection of Antisense Oligonucleotides of YB-1 in PBMCs—YB-1 antisense expression plasmid (PRC/CMV AS) was constructed as described previously (31Ohga T. Koike K. Ono M. Makino Y. Itagaki Y. Tanimoto M. Kuwano M. Kohno K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4224-4228PubMed Google Scholar). We transfected 2 μg of PRC/CMV AS or control vacant vector into 2 × 106 PBMCs in a 6-well culture dish using a cationic liposome-mediated transfection method, with cationic lipid reagents (DMRIE-CTM, Invitrogen) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer (32Itoh H.

Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2959-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Forty-eight h after transfection, the cells were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 5 μg/ml 6.9-kDa fragmented hyaluronan. Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction—After 6 h of incubation with or without 50 μg/ml of 6.9-kDa fragmented hyaluronan in RPMI 1640 (Nissui, Tokyo) containing 5% fetal calf serum (Bio-Pro, Karlsruhe, Germany), total cellular RNA from CD4+ T cells was isolated by a single step isolation procedure with ISOGEN (Wako, Osaka, Japan) and stored the purified total RNA at -80 °C. Total RNA (500 ng) was reverse transcribed at 42 °C for 30 min. Amplification with specific primers for MDR-1 and β-actin was performed in an iCycler (Bio-Rad) for 30 cycles of 45 s at 94 °C for denaturing, 45 s at 55 °C for annealing, and 90 s at 72 °C for extension. The primer sequences were as follows: human β-actin forward, 5′-TGAACCCCAAGGCCAACCGC-3′, reverse, 5′-TTGTGCTGGGTGCCAGGGCA-3′; human MDR-1 forward, 5′-CCCATCATTGCAATAGCAGG-3′, reverse, 5′-GTTCAAACTTCTGCTCCTGA-3′. Amplified products were electrophoresed with Marker 4 (Nippon Gene, Tokyo) on 3% agarose gels. Dexamethasone Accumulation—[14C]1-Butanol (Toho Biochemical, Tokyo; 1.61 mCi/mmol) was diluted with unlabeled butanol (Sigma) at a concentration of 0.5 MBq/ml. [3H]Dexamethasone (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; 40.0 Ci/mmol) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO; Nacalai tesque, Tokyo) and then diluted with phosphate-buffered saline (final concentration of Me2SO = 0.1%). CD4+ T cells, which were incubated with or without 50 μg/ml 6.9-kDa fragmented hyaluronan for 6 h at 37 °C, were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline with 7 mm dextrose for ATP supply, which is dispensable in this assay (35Richard C. John R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16059-16064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), at a density of 5 × 106 cells/ml. The CD4+ T cells were then incubated with 5.0 × 10-5 m [14C]1-butanol and 3.0 × 10-8 m [3H]dexamethasone for 20 min at 37 °C. For competitive studies with cyclosporin A, CD4+ T cells were incubated with 100 ng/ml cyclosporin A (Novartis Pharmaceutical, Japan Co., Tokyo) for 15 min and then incubated with [14C]1-butanol and [3H]dexamethasone. Cyclosporin A was dissolved in Me2SO before diluting with phosphate-buffered saline (final concentration of Me2SO was 0.03%). After incubation with fragmented hyaluronan and cyclosporin A, 100 μg/ml aliquots were layered on 80 μl of the mixture of lauryl bromide and silicon oil (mixture ratio 2:1, Nacalai tesque, Tokyo) in an Eppendorf tube (Assist, Tokyo). After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 2 min, the aliquots were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and the frozen tube was cut at the mediummixture bound-arias, thereby obtaining the upper layer as the medium fraction and the lower layer as the cell fraction. The obtained cell fractions were melted with soluene-350 and 10 ml of HIONIC-FLUOR (PerkinElmer) was added. The medium fractions were mixed with 10 ml of mixtures of toluene (Wako, Osaka, Japan), methanol (Wako), ethyleneglycol monoethyl ether (Nacalai tesque), and PERMAFLUOR (Packard; mixture ratio 200:50:50:12). The radioactivity of each fraction was counted with a scintillation counter. The cell to medium ratio (C/M ratio), which is an index of intracellular and extracellular dexamethasone concentration ratio, was computed using the following formula: C/M ratio = [(3H in cell fraction/14C in cell fraction)/(3H in medium fraction/14C in medium fraction)]. CD44 Blocking Analysis—CD4+ cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml Hermes-1 or rat IgG2a as control mAb for 30 min at 37 °C prior to incubation with or without 50 μg/ml 6.9-kDa fragmented hyaluronan, the cells were used for the following experiments. Western Blot Analysis—After incubation with or without 50 μg/ml 6.9-kDa fragmented hyaluronan, 2 × 106 of CD4+ T cells were homogenized in the presence of a hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The cells were allowed to swell on ice for 15 min, after which 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 was added and vortexed. The homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g to obtain pellet containing membrane. The pellet containing equal amounts of proteins prepared from 2 × 106 of CD4+ T cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were transferred onto the nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). After blocking with TBST-milk (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20, and 5% nonfat dry milk), the membrane was incubated overnight with 10 μg/ml F4 at 4 °C. The membrane was then washed with TBST and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse mAb (1:1000 dilution in TBST) for 30 min at room temperature. After three washes in TBST, proteins were detected using a chemiluminescence reagent (Detection Reagent, Amersham Biosciences) following the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. Statistical Analysis—Values are expressed as mean ± S.D. Student's t test was used to compare data between two groups. One-way analysis of variance and Bonferroni correction were used to compare data between three or more groups. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Fragmented Hyaluronan Up-regulates MDR-1 Gene Expression on PBMCs—We first assessed the effect of hyaluronan on P-glycoprotein expression in PBMCs. Expression of P-glycoprotein, as recognized by MRK16, was significantly induced by the addition of the 6.9-kDa fragmented hyaluronan during the observation periods (0-6 h), particularly at 6 h after incubation. In contrast, native hyaluronan (950 kDa) failed to induce P-glycoprotein expression on PBMCs (Fig. 1A). Therefore, we evaluated the expression of P-glycoprotein after a 6-h incubation with 6.9-kDa fragmented hyaluronan in the following studies. We observed that expression of P-glycoprotein was augmented in a dose-dependent manner up to 50 μg/ml 6.9-kDa fragmented hyaluronan (Fig. 1, B and C). Fragmented Hyaluronan Induces Nuclear Translocation of YB-1 in PBMCs—MDR-1 gene expression is initiated by activation and nuclear translocation of YB-1 in human lymphocytes (12Chaudhary P.M. Roninson I.B. Cell. 1991; 66: 85-94Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). We examined the intracellular distribution of the transcriptional factor YB-1 in PBMCs by immunostaining using anti-YB-1 monoclonal antibody. Confocal microscopic analysis showed localization of YB-1 in the cytoplasm of PBMCs at basal conditions and its translocation into the nucleus within 60 min of incubation with 6.9-kDa fragmented hyaluronan (Fig. 2A). We confirmed the induction of the DNA binding activity of YB-1 by 6.9-kDa fragmented hyaluronan by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Subsequently, we prepared nuclear extracts from PBMCs at basal conditions and after incubation with 6.9-kDa fragmented hyaluronan, and incubated them with a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing YB-1 consensus binding sites. We observed dense bands in the mixture of oligonucleotides and nuclear extracts derived from PBMCs stimulated with 6.9-kDa fragmented hyaluronan (Fig. 2B). These results imply that incubation of PBMCs with 6.9-kDa fragmented hyaluronan resulted in a sequence of events including activation of cytoplasmic nuclear factor YB-1, its nuclear translocation, and finally the binding of activated YB-1 to the promoter region of the MDR-1 gene. These results were consistent with those observed in the expression of P-glycoprotein in immunostaining. YB-1 Antisense Inhibits P-glycoprotein Expression on Lymphocytes—To determine whether YB-1 is directly coupled with fragmented hyaluronan-induced MDR-1 gene activation, we assessed the expression of P-glycoprotein on PBMCs transfected with YB-1 antisense expression plasmid (PRC/CMV AS) or control vacant vector and compared the levels of P-glycoprotein expression on PBMCs incubated with or without 6.9-kDa fragmented hyaluronan. In comparison with the vector alone, introduction of YB-1 antisense significantly reduced the expression of P-glycoprotein on PBMCs. Fragmented hyaluronan stimulation significantly increased the expression of P-glycoprotein on control cells, but such induction was abolished by transfection of YB-1 antisense (Fig. 3). Fragmented Hyaluronan Up-regulation of P-glycoprotein Expression on CD4+ T Cells—To investigate the expression of P-glycoprotein on lymphocytes in more detail, we next performed two-color analysis using anti-CD4 and -CD8 antibodies and examined P-glycoprotein expression on each subset of lymphocytes. Flow cytometric analysis showed that P-glycoprotein expression was significantly augmented by 6.9-kDa fragmented hyaluronan on CD4+ but not CD8+ cells in PBMCs (Fig. 4A). Therefore, in further studies, we analyzed purified CD4+ T cells isolated from PBMCs. We first evaluated the expression of P-glycoprotein on isolated CD4+ T cells after a 6-h incubation with 6.9-kDa fragmented hyaluronan. Expression of P-glycoprotein on isolated CD4+ T cells was significantly induced by the addition of the fragmented hyaluronan (Fig. 4, B-D). To test whether P-glycoprotein expression was the result of MDR-1 gene expression in response to fragmented hyaluronan, we examined the expression of MDR-1 mRNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. There was a substantial increase in MDR-1 mRNA relative to β-actin mRNA in isolated CD4+ T cells incubated with 6.9-kDa fragmented hyaluronan, compared with CD4+ T cells at the basal condition (Fig. 4E). Fragmented Hyaluronan Induces Simultaneous Activation of Resting CD4+ T Cells and Expression of P-glycoprotein—Recent studies from our laboratories demonstrated that soluble factors, which activate lymphocytes such as IL-2, induce YB-1 activation followed by P-glycoprotein expression in lymphocytes (13Tsujimura S. Saito K. Nakayamada S. Nakano K. Tsukada J. Kohno K. Tanaka Y. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the present study, we evaluated whether up-regulation of P-glycoprotein expression by fragmented hyaluronan accorded with activation of lymphocytes. We used the cell surface maker CD69, a well defined early activation marker of T cells (36Ziegler S.F. Ramsdell F. Alderson M.R. Stem Cells (Dayton). 1994; 12: 456-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), to monitor CD4+ T cell activation. Flow cytometric analysis showed that CD69 expression on CD4+ T cel"

In contrast to all known mechanisms that mediate alternative splicing in retroviruses, we found that in murine leukemia virus, distinct elements located upstream of the 5′ splice site either inhibited or activated splicing of the genomic RNA. Detailed analysis of the first untranslated exon showed that the primer binding site (PBS) activates splicing, whereas flanking sequences either downstream or upstream of the PBS are inhibitory. This new function of the PBS was independent of its orientation and primer binding but associated with a particular destabilizing role in a proposed secondary structure. On the contrary, all sequences surrounding the PBS that are involved in stem formation of the first exon were found to suppress splicing. Targeted mutations that destabilized the central stem and compensatory mutations of the counter strand clearly validated the concept that murine leukemia virus attenuates its 5′ splice site by forming an inhibitory stem-loop in its first exon. Importantly, this mode of splice regulation was conserved in a complete proviral clone. Some of the mutants that increase splicing revealed an opposite effect on translation, implying that the first exon also regulates this process. Together, these findings suggest that sequences upstream of the 5′ splice site play an important role in splice regulation of simple retroviruses, directly or indirectly attenuating the efficiency of splicing.

A characteristic feature of all retroviruses is the process of reverse transcription of the RNA genome into double-stranded DNA. Following integration into the host genome, the proviral DNA functions as one expression unit, which is transcribed by cellular RNA polymerase II, yielding a single polycistronic primary transcript that serves as genomic RNA for progeny virus. Productive infection and formation of new retroviral particles require the well balanced expression of all viral genes. This is accomplished by a combination of alternative splicing (intron retention) and regulated nuclear export of the primary transcript on the RNA processing level and proteolytic cleavage and translational read-through on the post-translational level (reviewed in Refs. 1Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Coffin J.M. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar, 4Wodrich H. Krausslich H.G. Results Probl. Cell Differ. 2001; 34: 197-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The genomic organization of all retroviruses is similar (Fig. 1A). The gag-pol open reading frame (ORF) 3The abbreviations used are: ORF, open reading frame; PBS, primer binding site; MLV, murine leukemia virus; ss, splice site(s); HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; RSL, R region stem-loop; PPT, polypyrimidine tract; GFP, green fluorescent protein; eGFP, enhanced GFP; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; CytC, cytochrome c oxidase II; pol, polymerase. 3The abbreviations used are: ORF, open reading frame; PBS, primer binding site; MLV, murine leukemia virus; ss, splice site(s); HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; RSL, R region stem-loop; PPT, polypyrimidine tract; GFP, green fluorescent protein; eGFP, enhanced GFP; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; CytC, cytochrome c oxidase II; pol, polymerase. encoding the inner structural proteins (Gag), and the replication enzymes (Pol) is located in the 5′ half of the transcript and expressed from the unspliced genomic RNA after nuclear export. The gag-pol ORF in all primary retroviral transcripts is defined as an intron through the presence of a preceding 5′ splice site (ss) in the 5′-untranslated region and a functional 3′ss located toward the end of the polymerase ORF (Fig. 1A). To express the glycoproteins (Env), which are encoded in the 3′ half of the genomic RNA, the gag-pol ORF is removed by a single splice event for subsequent export of the fully spliced RNA (1Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Coffin J.M. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar, 3Pollard V.W. Malim M.H. Annu. Rev.

This one-splice event strategy creates the challenge to export intron-containing RNAs, which is typically not supported by the cell and rather results in nuclear retention and degradation of the respective RNA (5Chang D.D. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1989; 59: 789-795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 6Legrain P. Rosbash M. Cell. 1989; 57: 573-583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). For export of their unspliced RNA, retroviruses make use of constitutive transport elements as exemplified by Mason-Pfizer monkey virus or trans-acting factors as illustrated by HIV (7Hammarskjold M.L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2001; 259: 77-93PubMed Google Scholar, 9Cullen B.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 419-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Murine leukemia virus (MLV), a paradigmatic gammaretrovirus, supports the export of unspliced mRNA by a yet unknown mechanism involving the so-called R region stem-loop (RSL) formed by the cap-proximal 28 bases (10Trubetskoy A.M. Okenquist S.A. Lenz J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3477-3483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As simple retroviruses encode no trans-acting regulators of gene expression, alternative or inefficient splicing must be regulated entirely through cis-acting RNA motifs and cellular co-factors. Such motifs may include non-consensus 3′ss, decoy 5′ss, and splice modulatory sequences such as splicing enhancers and silencers (11Bouck J. Fu X.D. Skalka A.M. Katz R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2663-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 12Zhang L. Stoltzfus C.M. Virology. 1995; 206: 1099-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 16Kraunus J. Schaumann D.H.

In MLV, the 5′ss matches to almost 100% the cellular consensus sequence (Fig. 1B) and splices to a 3′ss within the pol reading frame (13Lazo P.A. Prasad V. Tsichlis P.N. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 2038-2041Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). The 3′ss misses two relatively important nucleotides surrounding the AG. The polypyrimidine tract (PPT), a second key feature of all 3′ss, is of suboptimal length (10 nucleotides long when compared with 13 residues in average) but not interrupted by weakening purines as most PPTs of HIV (14Purcell D.F. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6365-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, a recent study showed that in the context of MLV-based retroviral vectors, the 3′ss can be replaced by very efficient counterparts derived from the human EF1α gene (15Lee J.T. Yu S.S. Han E. Kim S. Gene. Ther. 2004; 11: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although the infectious titer was reduced by about 1 order of magnitude, unspliced genomic RNA was still formed, arguing for the existence of additional splice inhibitory sequences. Recently, we have observed that self-inactivating MLV vectors display complete splicing of the retroviral intron when the promoter was placed in between the primer binding site (PBS) and the 5′ss (16Kraunus J. Schaumann D.H. Meyer J. Modlich U. Fehse B. Brandenburg G. Von Laer D. Klump H. Schambach A. Bohne J. Baum C. Gene. Ther. 2004; 11: 1568-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Using a number of mutants, we here demonstrate that distinct sequence elements upstream of the 5′ss either promote or inhibit splicing. Interestingly, this regulation correlates with the stability of the RNA secondary structure proposed by Mougel et al. (17Mougel M. Tounekti N. Darlix J.L. Paoletti J. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4677-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These data suggest a novel mechanism of splice regulation in retroviruses, directly or indirectly regulating the activity of the 5′ss through upstream sequences. Plasmids—The retroviral vector plasmids were derived from pSF91 (18Hildinger M. Abel K.L. Ostertag W. Baum C. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4083-4089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutant vectors lacking the U5 region of the 5′ long terminal repeat located 70–145 bp downstream of the cap site (pSF91delU5) or lacking the PBS located 146–163 bp downstream of the cap site (pSF91delPBS) were generated in a three-fragment ligation using PCR-based deletion strategies (primers are provided in the supplemental table). Using pSF91 as a template, two separate PCR products were generated. For the deletion of U5, the forward primer (forward, 5′-CAG ATG GTC CCC AGA TGC-3′, position –150 regarding cap) was used in combination with a reverse primer immediately upstream of U5. The 3′ primer (reverse, 5′-ACG CTG AAC TTG TGG CCG-3′) of the 3′ PCR product is located downstream of an NcoI site (+706 regarding cap). This primer was used in combination with a forward primer annealing just downstream of the U5 region. The two products were then digested with XbaI (5′ fragment) and NcoI (3′ fragment), leaving a blunt end in the middle. The two products were ligated into XbaI/NcoI digested pSF91. An analogous strategy was used for the deletion of the PBS. All other vector plasmids including deletion, antisense, and other mutants were derived from pSF91 by overlap PCR. Again, pSF91 was used as template. The outer 5′ and 3′ primers are mentioned above. The inner primers bridge the deletion (in the case of pSF91del33–182: sense primer, 5′-AGT CGC CCG G-GA CCA CCG ACC CCC CCG CCG-3′; antisense primer, 5′-GTC GGT GGT C-CC GGG CGA CTC AGT CAA TCG-3′, overlap is underlined, hyphen marks the deletion) or carry the suitable point mutations (in the case of pSF91mlvPBS: sense primer, 5′-CAT TTG GGGGCTCGT CCG GGA TTT GGA GAC CCC TG-3′; antisense 5′-CCA AAT CCCGGACGA GCC CCC AAA TGA AAG ACC CC-3′, overlap is underlined, mutations are bold). The overlapping PCR product was digested with XbaI and NcoI and ligated into the pSF91 backbone. For the deletions or mutations named sm1, sm2, sm3, and sm3comp, a different 3′ primer (5′-AAT GGG CCA CAA AAC GGG CCC CCG A-3′) was used, including an ApaI site. The final overlap PCR product was then cloned via XbaI and ApaI. All used primers (FW, forward; RV, reverse) are listed in the supplemental table, indicating name, sequence, and final vector construct. To transfer the PBS and the deletion 3′PBS to a complete proviral clone, an EcoRI/PstI fragment of pMOVGFP (kind gift from B. Schnierle, Paul-Ehrlich-Institute, Langen, Germany) was subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene). Within this subclone, the AflII/PstI fragment (–464 to +563, regarding the cap site as +1) was exchanged to the corresponding pSF91 sequence and to that of SF91delPBS and SF91del3′PBS via AflII and PstI, yielding pMOVSFGFP, pMOVSFdelPBSGFP, and pMOVSFdel3′PBSGFP, respectively. Correct deletions or nucleotide replacements were confirmed by sequencing. Cells, Transfections, and Reporter Assays—293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate including antibiotics. 7 × 105 293T cells/well were seeded in a 6-well plate. For transfection, the medium was exchanged, and 25 μm chloroquine (Sigma, Taufkirchen, Germany) was added. Retroviral vector DNA (0.9 μg) was transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (19Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). Medium was exchanged 6 h after transfection, and the cells were harvested after 48 h. Transfection efficiencies ranging between 60 and 80% and protein expression were assessed by flow cytometry in a FACScalibur (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany) using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Retroviral vector particles were produced by cotransfection of 0.9 μg of retroviral plasmid pSF91 with expression plasmids for MLV gag-pol (1.5 μg) and ecotropic envelope (0.3 μg) into 7 × 105 Phoenix GP (G. Nolan, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA) cells. In the case of pSF91artPBS, plasmids coding for artificial tRNAs (tRNA-x2-Lys, tRNA-x2-Pro (20Lund A.H. Duch M. Lovmand J. Jorgensen P. Pedersen F.S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1191-1195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) were co-transfected. Supernatants containing the viral particles were collected 48 h after transfection, filtered through a 0.22-μm filter, and used to transduce 1 × 105 target cells in serial dilutions for titer determination. Transduction was assisted by adding 4 μg/ml protamine sulfate and centrifugation for 60 min at 400 × g and 25–32 °C. Cells were grown for another 2 days before the percentage of enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)-positive cells was determined by flow cytometry. Further analysis was limited to those experiments where less than 30% of target cells were productively transduced. RNA Preparation and Northern Blot—For preparation of nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA, 8 × 106 cells were collected 48 h after transfection and treated according to the protocol of Weil et al. (21Weil D. Boutain S. Audibert A. Dautry F. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2000; 6: 962-975Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were resuspended in 500 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.14 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.4, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) for 5 min at 0 °C. After centrifugation at 470 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatant containing the cytoplasmic fraction was harvested. The nuclear pellet was washed twice with lysis buffer. RNA was extracted from total cells or nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions using the RNA Instapure reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Eurogentec, Brussels, Belgium). For Northern blot, 5–10 μg of RNA were separated at 2 V/cm in 1% agarose gels after denaturing RNA samples with glyoxal (6%) and Me2SO (50%). Subsequently, RNAs were transferred to Biodyne B membrane (0.45 μm, Pall) by capillary transfer and UV cross-linked (Stratalinker, Stratagene). Specific probes used for hybridization corresponded to the cDNAs of eGFP, GAPDH, cytochrome c oxidase II, and the env fragment of MLV. Probes (25 ng) were radiolabeled using the Prime-It II kit (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) to an activity of at least 5 × 108 cpm/μg and separated from unincorporated nucleotides on spin columns (Molecular probes, Göttingen, Germany). DNA template used for the in vitro transcription to generate antisense RNA probes specific for the GAPDH intron B was raised by PCR on genomic DNA using reverse primer 5′-GGA CTA GTT AAT ACG ACT CAC TAT AGG GTG CGG TGG AGA TCT G-3′ containing the T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence (shown in bold) and forward primer 5′-CAA GGA GAG CTC AAG GTC-3′. Transcription reactions were carried out with 0.5 μl of PCR product in a final volume of 20 μl in transcription buffer (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) containing 0.31 mm ATP, CTP, and GTP, 0.25 μm UTP, 5.0 μm [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol; Hartmann Analytic, Braunschweig, Germany), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 units of RNasin (Promega), and 20 units of T7 RNA polymerase (Promega). The reaction was terminated by adding 10 μg of yeast tRNA and 1 unit of DNaseI (Promega) and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed as above. Hybridization solutions had a final activity of 106 cpm/ml. Membranes were washed, sealed, and exposed to x-ray films (Kodak X-omat-AR, Kodak, Stuttgart, Germany) or quantified by PhosphorImager analysis (Fuji, Düsseldorf, Germany; Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany) analysis. The MLV-derived Vector SF91 Shows Balanced Splicing— The MLV-based vector SF91 (18Hildinger M. Abel K.L. Ostertag W. Baum C. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4083-4089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A) was used to investigate the potential splice regulatory role of sequences located upstream of the 5′ss, namely R, U5, PBS, and a short region downstream of PBS (here referred to as 3′PBS). The SF91 vector is derived from MLV by deleting the gag-pol ORF and introducing the env 3′ss including its PPT and branch point sequences 3′ of the packaging signal (Ψ) followed by the original gag ATG, which allows translation of a reporter gene such as eGFP. Importantly, the vector SF91 contains a 460-bp spliceable intron in the 5′-untranslated region, which uses the same 5′ss and 3′ss as the proviral gag-pol intron. For a detailed analysis of splicing, vector plasmids were transiently transfected into human 293T cells. These were harvested 48 h after transfection to prepare nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA. 5 or 10 μgof each RNA fraction were analyzed by Northern blotting. The vector SF91 showed balanced splicing with a predominance of the unspliced RNA in the nucleus (Fig. 2B, lane 2, left panel), whereas the cytoplasmic compartment revealed an accumulation of spliced message, most likely caused by more efficient export of processed RNA (Fig. 2B, lane 2, right panel). Due to this imbalance in the export kinetics of spliced and unspliced RNAs, we investigated both RNA fractions, assuming that mutants with inhibited splicing would be underrepresented in total RNA and in the cytoplasmic fraction. To control the RNA fractionation procedure, two probes were devised. The first recognized intron B of GAPDH (Fig. 2B, Intron), whose signal should be confined to the nuclear fraction. Using the intron probe, we detected two specific bands at 6.8 kb and about 13 kb in the nucleus, corresponding to the pre-mRNA (NCBI accession number NC_000012.10) and a longer transcript, which was observed previously (22Dani C. Piechaczyk M. Audigier Y. El Sabouty S. Cathala G. Marty L. Fort P. Blanchard J.M. Jeanteur P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 145: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar); these transcripts were much weaker or absent in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2B, right panel). Another band at 5 kb was detectable in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions (Fig. 2B). The size matched to the large ribosomal RNA (28 S), and since this was also seen with other probes, we regarded it as unspecific. The second probe was a fragment of cytochrome c oxidase II (CytC), a gene exclusively transcribed in the mitochondria, thus serving as a cytoplasmic marker. Due to incomplete removal of mitochondria from the nucleus, the nuclear fraction was never fully devoid of CytC RNA (Fig. 2B, left panel). In summary, we established a simplified system to study retroviral splice regulation and nuclear export of MLV RNA. Distinct Elements in the Untranslated First Exon Regulate Splicing and RNA Export—Next we focused on the region upstream of the 5′ss and its role in splice regulation. Following earlier experiments (16Kraunus J. Schaumann D.H. Meyer J. Modlich U. Fehse B. Brandenburg G. Von Laer D. Klump H. Schambach A. Bohne J. Baum C. Gene. Ther. 2004; 11: 1568-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), we deleted bases +33 to +182 (with the cap site being +1) upstream of the 5′ss, resulting in the vector SF91del33–182 (Fig. 2A). When analyzed in parallel with SF91, SF91del33–182 showed an increased splicing efficiency in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 2B, lane 3, left panel). Accordingly, the cytoplasm contained almost exclusively spliced RNA, whereas unspliced RNA could only be detected after prolonged exposure (data not shown). This experiment revealed that the deleted sequences, located upstream of the 5′ss, play a major role in retroviral RNA processing. This rather large deletion also seems to lower the RNA level (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 3, left panel). In contrast, smaller deletions that also increased the efficiency of splicing did not affect RNA levels (see below). To examine the role of the RSL, previously shown to promote the appearance of unspliced RNA in the cytoplasm (10Trubetskoy A.M. Okenquist S.A. Lenz J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3477-3483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we constructed another vector lacking the bases 4–31 of the R region (SF91delRSL, Fig. 2A) and thus the entire RSL. When compared with SF91, deletion of the RSL enhanced nuclear splicing by 2.5-fold (as determined by PhosphorImager analysis). In addition, deleting the RSL inhibited the accumulation of unspliced RNA in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 4). The ratio of spliced/unspliced RNA in the cytoplasm was 2.3 for SF91 and changed to 8.6 for SF91delRSL (3.8-fold enhancement). These data confirm that the RSL is involved in RNA export (10Trubetskoy A.M. Okenquist S.A. Lenz J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3477-3483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); moreover, our data suggest that the RSL participates in balancing the retroviral splice reaction. Splicing Is Blocked in Vectors Lacking the PBS—To study the role of the remaining sequences in the untranslated first exon in more detail, we deleted parts of this region separately. The vectors as shown in Fig. 3A were SF91delR2 (R deletion 3′ of the RSL), SF91delU5 (deletion of U5), SF91delPBS (deletion of the PBS), and SF91del3′PBS (deletion of bases +164 to +182, immediately downstream of the PBS). Following transient transfection of 293T cells and fractionation of nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA, Northern blots were performed as described above. Deletions of R2, U5, or 3′PBS produced similar amounts of total RNA but strongly enhanced the accumulation of spliced message already in the nucleus (Fig. 3B, lanes 3, 4, and 7, left panel). The overloaded lanes 4 and 7 revealed that unspliced RNA was still detectable with these deletion mutants. In contrast, splicing was nearly blocked when deleting the PBS (Fig. 3B, lane 6, left panel). Another deletion mutant with the combined deletion of PBS sequences and downstream sequences +164 to +182 (SF91delPBS-3′PBS, Fig. 3A) demonstrated a similar phenotype as SF91del3′PBS, in which only the bases +164 to +182 were deleted (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 5 and 7). Therefore, the latter mutation was dominant over the deletion of the PBS. For all these mutants except the one with the deleted PBS, we detected only spliced RNA in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 3B, right panel, compare lane 6 with lanes 3, 4, 5, and 7). This reflected the strength of the nuclear splicing reaction. As overexposure of the blot showed unspliced RNA in these cases (data not shown), a strong effect of the deleted sequences on RNA export was unlikely. The correctness of the transcripts was proven by RT-PCR and subsequent sequence analysis (data not shown). The additional band observed in the nucleus was refractory to sequence analysis due to PCR-intramolecular hybridization. However, scoring the first untranslated exon in a splice site prediction program (available from the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project) revealed a cryptic 5′ss at 262 nucleotides (3′ to the major 5′ss, consistent with the observed band). Interestingly, splicing at this site was not inhibited by deletion of the PBS (Fig. 3B, lane 6, left panel). In summary, these data revealed an exceptional role of the PBS being the only element within the first untranslated exon that promotes retroviral splicing from the 5′ss, whereas the surrounding sequences inhibit this process. Deletion of U5 and 3′PBS Impairs Translational Utilization—Taking advantage of eGFP encoded by the vectors, we also determined the influence of the 5′-untranslated region deletions on the protein level in transfected 293T cells. Although the deletion of U5 and 3′PBS produced almost exclusively spliced RNA in the cytoplasm, the mean fluorescence intensity was markedly decreased (Fig. 3C). Both U5 and 3′PBS deletions reduced the mean fluorescence intensity by 80% when compared with the parental vector SF91. Thus, in these deletion mutants, the amount of spliced RNA in the cytoplasm did not correlate with translational utilization (compare Fig. 3B, right panel with Fig. 3C). However, deleting the PBS reduced GFP expression by 40%, which correlated with the reduced amount of spliced RNA. We extended these observations to 293T-based packaging cells, which stably produce MLV Gag-Pol. The presence of Gag did not alter the translational regulation (data not shown). Moreover, identical data were obtained in transfected HeLa cells (data not shown). These data suggest that the sequences involved in splice regulation also contribute to translational control of the retroviral transcript. The Splice-promoting Effect of the PBS Is Independent of Its Genotype and Primer Binding—To find out whether the role of the PBS in splice regulation is dependent on the type of the corresponding tRNA and is therefore dependent on the PBS sequence or whether primer binding itself regulates splicing, we developed another set of PBS mutants. MLV typically contains a PBS with a specificity for the proline tRNA. Our vectors contain a PBS with a specificity for the glutamine tRNA as this PBS does not inhibit transcription in primitive embryonic and hematopoietic stem cells (23Grez M. Zornig M. Nowock J. Ziegler M. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4691-4698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Logan A.C. Haas D.L. Kafri T. Kohn D.B. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 8421-8436Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Exchanging the PBS for tRNAGln used in SF91 to the PBS for tRNAPro usually found in MLV (five point mutations within the 18 bases of the PBS) yielded SF91mlvPBS (Fig. 3A). In the transient transfection assay, SF91 and SF91mlvPBS showed similar splicing patterns, as shown in Fig. 3B (lanes 2 and 8, left and right panel). The independence of the kind of PBS and corresponding tRNA in splice regulation was also confirmed by a mutant containing the MLV-PBS followed by a deletion of +164 to +182 (SF91mlvPBSdel3′PBS, Fig. 3A). When compared with its SF91 counterpart (SF91del3′PBS), a similar splice alteration was observed in both cases (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 7 and 9, left and right panel). These data showed that the dominant splice inhibitory effect of the region 3′ of the PBS is independent of the type of the neighboring PBS and that the experimental system provided highly reproducible results. Annealing of the tRNA to the PBS takes place during virion assembly (25Marquet R. Isel C. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Biochimie (Paris). 1995; 77: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). However, it is still possible that tRNA precursors, which are present in the nucleus (26Iborra F.J. Jackson D.A. Cook P.R. Science. 2001; 293: 1139-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), might anneal to the PBS of the pre-mRNA. To rule out any effects of primer tRNA binding in splice regulation, we designed vectors containing an artificial PBS (SF91artPBS), which does not bind any cellular tRNA, adapting the approach developed by Pedersen and colleagues (20Lund A.H. Duch M. Lovmand J. Jorgensen P. Pedersen F.S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1191-1195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as described in Ref. 27Galla M. Will E. Kraunus J. Chen L. Baum C. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 309-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar. With this method, it is possible to examine splicing in the absence or presence of a bound tRNA primer. We found that the potential annealing of a matching tRNA did not alter splicing efficiency, strongly suggesting that binding of a tRNA primer is not important for splice regulation (data not shown). Evidence for a Structural Role of the PBS in Splice Enhancement—The previous experiments imply that the role of the PBS in balanced splicing is not dependent on tRNA specificity or primer binding. To analyze whether the role of the PBS in splice regulation is largely sequence-independent, we developed a mutant that carries the PBS in antisense orientation ("

Plasmepsin II (PM II) is the best studied member of this family. PM II and its close orthologs and paralogs form homodimers with extensive interfaces in all known crystal structures. This raised the question whether the homodimer is the functional subunit of plasmepsins in solution. We have used gel filtration chromatography, site-directed mutagenesis, and analytical ultracentrifugation to study the oligomeric status of PM II in solution.

Malaria is caused by the apicomplexan protozoan parasite Plasmodium. During its development in host erythrocytes, the parasite engulfs and degrades up to 80% of the host cell hemoglobin (1Loria P. Miller S. Foley M. Tilley L. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and utilizes nutrients released from this catabolic process (2Liu J. Istvan E.S. Gluzman I.Y. Gross J. Goldberg D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8840-8845Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Hemoglobin degradation is essential for the parasite to survive. Disruption of this process is an attractive drug development strategy. Hemoglobin degradation occurs in the acidic food vacuole of the parasite (3Francis S.E. Sullivan D.J. Goldberg D.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 97-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Multiple proteases have been identified in the food vacuole, including plasmepsins (4Goldberg D.E. Sullivan D. Krishna S. Malaria: Drugs, Disease, and Post-Genomic Biology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin and Heidelberg2005: 275Google Scholar). There is only one food vacuole plasmepsin for most Plasmodium species studied (5Martins T.M. Domingos A. Berry C. Wyatt D.M.

Parasitol. 2003; 130: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The exception is P. falciparum, the causative agent of severe malaria, which has four food vacuole plasmepsins (7Banerjee R. Liu J. Beatty W. Pelosof L. Klemba M. Goldberg D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 990-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The four proteins share a high degree of homology (60-70% amino acid identity) and are named plasmepsins (PM) 4The abbreviation used is: PM II, plasmepsin II. I, II, IV, and HAP. HAP stands for histo-aspartic protease, because its catalytic dyad has a histidine instead of one of the two canonical aspartates. Despite this substitution, HAP is believed to be an active protease (7Banerjee R. Liu J. Beatty W. Pelosof L. Klemba M. Goldberg D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 990-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 8Xiao H. Sinkovits A.F. Bryksa B.C. Ogawa M. Yada R.Y. Protein Expression Purif. 2006; 49: 88-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Plasmepsins are involved in the early steps of hemoglobin degradation. They are able to recognize intact hemoglobin and make an initial cleavage in the B helix of the hemoglobin α-chain between Phe-33 and Leu-34 (9Goldberg D.E. Slater A.F. Beavis R. Chait B. Cerami A. Henderson G.B. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 961-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). This cleavage is believed to unravel the globin chain, facilitating subsequent proteolytic cleavages. Recent gene disruption studies have indicated that PM II as well as the other food vacuole plasmepsins are not essential for parasite survival but each contributes to optimal parasite growth (2Liu J.

Homodimerization is one common quaternary configuration, and it has been implicated in the catalytic activity and stability of some members of the aspartic protease family. For example, human immunodeficiency virus 1 protease relies on the formation of the homodimer to complete its active site aspartate dyad (12Navia M.A. Fitzgerald P.M. McKeever B.M. Leu C.T.

Cathepsin E is a homodimer linked by an inter-molecular disulfide bridge (14Ostermann N. Gerhartz B. Worpenberg S. Trappe J. Eder J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 889-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The disulfide bridge, and thus the dimer, is not essential for cathepsin E activity, but it contributes to the stability of the enzyme (15Fowler S.D. Kay J. Dunn B.M. Tatnell P.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 366: 72-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Both β-amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme and presenilin, the core components of the β- and γ-secretases of amyloid precursor protein, respectively, form dimers in the membrane (16Westmeyer G.G. Willem M. Lichtenthaler S.F. Lurman G. Multhaup G. Assfalg-Machleidt I. Reiss K. Saftig P. Haass C. J. Biol.

It is believed that dimerization is important for β-amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme to recognize specific substrate motifs (16Westmeyer G.G. Willem M. Lichtenthaler S.F. Lurman G.

The constraints on variability of dimer interface residues have been exploited in the case of human immunodeficiency virus protease to develop potent inhibitors that may be refractory to drug resistance mutation (18Hwang Y.S. Chmielewski J. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 2239-2242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 19Merabet N. Dumond J. Collinet B. Van Baelinghem L. Boggetto N. Ongeri S. Ressad F. Reboud-Ravaux M. Sicsic S. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 6392-6400Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Multiple x-ray crystal structures of PM II, as well as those of PM IV, Plasmodium vivax, and Plasmodium malariae plasmepsins, have been determined. Interestingly, all of them are tightly associated homodimers (20Madabushi A. Chakraborty S. Fisher S.Z. Clemente J.C. Yowell C. Agbandje-McKenna M. Dame J.B. Dunn B.M. McKenna R. Acta Crystallogr.

These structures were obtained using different crystallization conditions and have different crystallographic symmetries. Different ligands are bound or, in one case, absent (24Asojo O.A. Gulnik S.V. Afonina E. Yu B. Ellman J.A. Haque T.S. Silva A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The surface area that is buried in the conserved dimer interface is large, up to ∼2500 Å2 (24Asojo O.A. Gulnik S.V. Afonina E. Yu B. Ellman J.A. Haque T.S. Silva A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This raised the questions of what quaternary structure plasmepsins have in solution and whether dimerization is necessary for their catalytic function. Because of the high degree of homology among the four P. falciparum food vacuole plasmepsins, especially the conservation of residues at the dimer interface in crystals, it was also possible that plasmepsins could form heterodimers in the food vacuole, which might be another means of modulating their catalytic activities in vivo. To explore these possibilities, we studied the quaternary structure of PM II in solution by using gel filtration chromatography, site-directed mutagenesis, and analytical ultracentrifugation. Preparation of Recombinant Proteins—Recombinant PM II was prepared in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies. The protease was expressed as the mature form, lacking the pro-domain. Recombinant PM II has been shown to have activity comparable with that of native enzyme (27Luker K.E. Francis S.E. Gluzman I.Y. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 79: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 28Istvan E.S. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6890-6896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Expression, purification, and refolding were accomplished according to the procedure described in Ref. 28Istvan E.S. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6890-6896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar. Mutant constructs were prepared using QuikChange (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with the following primers (complementary primers are not listed): 5′-CCATTTACATTTATTCTTTCTACAGGATCTGCTAATTTATGGGTCCC-3′ (for D34S), 5′-GCAAACTGTATTGTATCTAGTGGTACTAGTGCCATTACTGTACC-3′ (for D214S), 5′-CCATTTACATTTATTCTTGCTACAGGATCTGCTAATTTATGGGTCCC-3′ (for D34A), and 5′-GCAAACTGTATTGTAGCTAGTGGTACTAGTGCCATTACTGTACC-3′ (for D214A). The PM II-cathepsin E chimera was prepared using a three-step QuikChange mutagenesis. Step one involved the deletion of residues 241-252 in PM II (primer: 5′-GCAGAATTTAGATGTTATCAACAACAGCAAATTACCAAC-3′). Six amino acids (PVDGEY) of the cathepsin E loop were inserted in step two (primer: 5′-GCAGAATTTAGATGTTATCCCGGTTGACGGTGAATACAACAACAGCAAATTACCAAC-3′). In step three, five additional amino acids (AVECA) of the cathepsin E loop were inserted (primer: 5′-GGTTGACGGTGAATACGCTGTTGAATGCGCTAACAACAGCAAATTACCAAC-3′). The resulting chimeric protein contains the amino acid sequence V236I237PVDGEYAVECAN250N251 (subscript numbers correspond to amino acid number of PM II). All mutated sequences were confirmed by PCR sequencing (Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Laboratory, Washington University School of Medicine). A chimera in which the loop from PM II was inserted into cathepsin E was also constructed. This protein failed to refold and could not be analyzed further. Gel Filtration Chromatography—A Waters (Milford, MA) 626 HPLC system and an GE Healthcare Hi-load 26/60 Superdex 75 pg column were used. The column was equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.25 m NaCl, 10% glycerol. The same buffer was used as eluent at the rate of 1 ml/min. The column was calibrated with Bio-Rad gel filtration molecular weight standards before use. 5 ml of preclarified recombinant PM II and its mutants were loaded on the column, and the elution was monitored at 280 nm. 2-ml fractions were collected and pooled as indicated in Fig. 1B. Equilibrium Sedimentation—∼50 ml of gel filtration-purified PM II was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.25 m NaCl overnight at 4 °C to remove glycerol. The sample was then concentrated down to 500 μl by ultrafiltration with an Amicon Centriprep YM-30 column (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Equilibrium sedimentation experiments were performed on a Beckman Coulter (Fullerton, CA) XLA-70 analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with a Ti-50 rotor at the Keck Biophysics Facility at Northwestern University. All experiments were run at 4 °C. The samples were sedimented to equilibrium at rotor speeds of 15,500 rpm for 35 h, 22,300 rpm for 25 h, 29,200 rpm for 17 h, 36,100 for 10 h, and 43,000 rpm for 6 h. The equilibrium buffers used were 10 mm NaH2PO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 5.2 or 7.2, as noted under “Results.” The samples were loaded at four initial concentrations, OD 0.3 and 0.5 at 280 nm and OD 0.3 and 0.5 at 230 nm. The radial step size was 0.001 cm. Data analysis was performed with Ultrascan 7.0 (www.ultrascan.uthscsa.edu) at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. The data were fitted to multiple models, including a monomer-dimer equilibrium model, an ideal non-interacting two-component model, and an ideal one-component model. Inhibitor Competition Assay—The enzyme activity assay was modified from the published procedure (28Istvan E.S. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6890-6896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and the competition assay was based on the work of Tang and co-workers (29Lin X.L. Wong R.N. Tang J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4482-4489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All reactions (in triplicate) were incubated in a 96-well plate at 37 °C, and the fluorescence was read at the time points of 0, 10, 60, 120, and 180 min. A 96-well fluorescence plate reader adapted to a Cary Eclipse fluorometer (Varian, Palo Alto, CA) was used. The fluorogenic peptide substrate 2837b, (EDANS-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-ALERMFLSFP-Dap-(DABCYL)OH) (AnaSpec, San Jose, CA) (28Istvan E.S. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6890-6896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), was used at 1μm. The excitation wavelength was 336 nm, and the emission wavelength was 490 nm. Both the excitation and emission slit widths were 10 nm. The reaction buffer was 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.4, 10% glycerol, 0.1% octyl β-d-glucopyranoside (Sigma). When applicable, wild-type PM II was added to the reaction at 0.3 nm. Pepstatin A (Calbiochem) concentrations used were 0, 0.075 (molar ratio 1:4, inhibitor:enzyme), and 0.3 nm (molar ratio 1:1, inhibitor:enzyme), respectively. The mutant proteins were added to the reactions (as indicated in Fig. 3) in 4-fold excess over wild-type PM II based on OD at 280 nm. Enzyme Kinetics—Kinetic parameters of wild-type PM II and the chimera were measured in 0.2 m sodium acetate (pH 5.0), 20% glycerol with substrate 3037b (28Istvan E.S. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6890-6896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) in 400-μl reactions. Averages of three to four measurements were used at each substrate concentration. Km and Vmax values were calculated by direct fitting of initial rates using the Michaelis-Menten equation and Kaleidagraph software (Synergy, Reading, PA). Concentrations of enzymes were determined by active site titration with pepstatin A, and the kcat was calculated from kcat = Vmax/[E]. For wild-type PM II, 7.75 nm protease was used in the assays; for the chimera, the concentration was 12.0 nm. Hemoglobin and Hemoglobin α-Chain Degradation—Hemoglobin degradation assays were performed in 0.2 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 20% glycerol as described (28Istvan E.S. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6890-6896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For the hemoglobin degradation, 90 nm protease and 15 μm hemoglobin (based on heme) were used. For the hemoglobin α-chain degradation, similar substrate concentrations but decreased protease (21 nm) were used. Gel Filtration Chromatography of PM II—Mature PM II was expressed in E. coli as inclusion bodies. The inclusion bodies were refolded and purified to near homogeneity as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A, lane 1). The preparation was subjected to one more chromatographic step using gel filtration chromatography. There was no apparent improvement in the homogeneity of the preparation (Fig. 1A, lane 2), but the gel filtration column was able to separate two distinct peaks (Fig. 1B). Peak 1, the earlier eluting peak, is inactive under the standard enzymatic assay for PM II (Fig. 1C). In contrast, peak 2 is highly active. Based on calibration of the column with molecular mass standards, peak 2 migrates at ∼45 kDa and corresponds to PM II monomer, whereas peak 1 is likely to be oligomeric aggregates (maximal at >600 kDa). No change in elution profile was seen in the presence of pepstatin A (not shown). Because the resolution of the gel filtration column is limited and non-ideal interactions between protein and gel filtration matrix can affect the elution position of the protein, it is also conceivable that peak 2 contains PM II dimers rather than monomers. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—To investigate this further, we subjected the active fraction (pooled peak 2) to analytical ultracentrifugation. Equilibrium sedimentation data were collected, and a global equilibrium analysis was performed. This method has the advantage of being able to accurately determine molecular weight independent of molecule shape and matrix-protein interactions and to access the distribution of different molecular weight species in the system. In particular, a monomer-dimer equilibrium can be detected, if it exists. We did the analysis at pH 7.2, at which PM II is catalytically slow, and at pH 5.2, at which PM II has optimal activity and is close to its physiological environment in the food vacuole. Because it is known that ligand binding changes enzyme shape and may promote inter-molecular interactions, we did the analysis in the presence of pepstatin A (protein:inhibitor, 1:2 molar ratio) and compared the results to those without it. At pH 5.2, pepstatin A proved essential because in its absence there was significant self-degradation of PM II at the high protein concentration required for sedimentation analysis, even when the analysis was done at 4 °C. Multiple rotor speeds and protein loading concentrations were used (details under “Experimental Procedures”). The global analysis approach removes the concern that a set of data can be fitted to an incorrect model as may happen in the case of sedimentation velocity analysis or equilibrium sedimentation analysis using few conditions. The observed optical absorbance versus radium position is displayed in Fig. 2, upper panels, red dots. The data were fitted to different models, including an ideal one-component model, an ideal non-interacting two-component model, and a monomer-dimer equilibrium model. The summary of the results is in Table 1. The fitting to the monomer-dimer model is not shown for the pH 5.2 conditions because the modeling did not converge, suggesting it is a clearly unfitted model. As shown in Table 1, the ideal non-interacting two-component model has the least variance (<3.0 × 10-5) in all conditions tested. The other two models have higher variances or cannot be fitted. This result indicates that in each of the conditions tested there are two species with different molecular mass and they are not in equilibrium. For the pepstatin A-bound conditions, the molecular mass for the smaller species is 37.0 kDa at pH 5.2 and 38.8 kDa at pH 7.2. These numbers are close to the theoretical molecular mass of PM II (36.9 kDa) plus pepstatin A (686). The molecular mass for the larger species is about three times the monomeric molecular mass so it is likely due to PM II oligomeric aggregates. At pH 7.2 with no pepstatin A bound, the molecular mass of the smaller species is slightly lower than the theoretical number. This may due to the relatively less compacted structure of the protein when there is no ligand bound, and therefore the buoyancy would be larger. At pH 5.2 with no pepstatin A bound, most PM II has been degraded over the course of the equilibrium sedimentation as we predicted based on preliminary experiments. The molecular mass of 7.2 kDa could be due to degraded PM II fragments.TABLE 1Summary of global equilibrium analysisConditionFitting modelaA stands for ideal one-component model; A, B stands for ideal, two non-interacting component model; 2A ↔ A2 stands for monomer-dimer equilibrium modelVarianceMolecular massAMolecular massBKabKa, association constantkDakDam–1pH 7.2 no inhibitorA1.6 × 10–442.8A, B2.3 × 10–532.895.62A ↔ A21.0 × 10–431.28.9 × 10–6pH 7.2 plus inhibitorA, B2.9 × 10–538.8121.72A ↔ A29.3 × 10–540.01.3 × 10–5pH 5.2 no inhibitorA2.3 × 10–438.3A, B1.7 × 10–57.244.2pH 5.2 plus inhibitorA3.0 × 10–465.1A, B3.0 × 10–537.0100.6a A stands for ideal one-component model; A, B stands for ideal, two non-interacting component model; 2A ↔ A2 stands for monomer-dimer equilibrium modelb Ka, association constant Open table in a new tab The simulated curves of the best-fit models are displayed in Fig. 2, upper panels, blue lines, and the corresponding residues for observed data points are also graphed in Fig. 2, bottom panels. For all the conditions, the residues are centered at zero and randomly distributed with small variance. This indicates that the non-interacting two-component model faithfully represents the oligomeric status of PM II in solution. From the molecular mass-optical density graphs (Fig. 3), it can be seen that the formation of the oligomeric PM II from monomers is an irreversible process. When approaching the same protein concentration at different rotor speeds and from different loading concentrations, aggregates with different oligomeric status are formed. This is consistent with the results of gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 1, B and C). There, PM II lost its enzymatic activity after the formation of soluble oligomeric aggregates, and activity could not be restored by dilution. Competition with Active Site Mutants of PM II—A number of eukaryotic aspartic proteases rely on the formation of homodimers to gain catalytic activity (12Navia M.A. Fitzgerald P.M. McKeever B.M.

If PM II were to form dimers in solution and rely on the dimer for catalysis, replacement of one of the monomers with an active site mutant should abolish the wild-type PM II activity. Alternatively, if the monomer is the catalytic unit, mixing wild-type PM II with active site mutant would not affect the wild-type activity. We mutated the PM II catalytic aspartates (D34A, D34S, D214A, and D34S/D214S). These mutations abolished proteolytic activity (Fig. 4, red lines). To assess correct refolding (29Lin X.L. Wong R.N. Tang J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4482-4489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we mixed wild-type and mutant PM II and assessed ability of mutant enzymes to bind pepstatin A competitively and thus relieve pepstatin inhibition of wild-type activity. As shown in Fig. 4, D214A, D34S/D214S, and to a lesser extent D34S could competitively bind pepstatin A and restore wild-type PM II activity when the mutant enzyme was added in excess. This is an indication that the three mutants had refolded correctly. In contrast, D34A was not able to bind pepstatin A, perhaps reflecting improper enzyme folding. In the absence of pepstatin A, the proteolytic activity of wild-type PM II was not affected by addition of excess mutant enzyme (Fig. 4, blue lines). This suggests that the catalytic unit of PM II is the monomer rather than the dimer. Enzymatic Activity of PM II-Cathepsin E Chimera—Human hemoglobin is initially cleaved by PM II between α Phe-33 and Leu-34. This peptide bond is buried within an α helix in the tightly packed, hydrophobic hemoglobin molecule. It is an intriguing question as to how PM II active site residues access the Phe-33-Leu-34 peptide bond and make the initial cleavage. One possible mechanism is that PM II may be a hemoglobin “denaturase,” using residues outside the active site to interact with hemoglobin and make the Phe-33-Leu-34 peptide bond accessible (28Istvan E.S. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6890-6896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Candidate residues that might interact with the hydrophobic hemoglobin surface residues are found among a hydrophobic stretch (239-248, VPFLPFYVTLC) conserved among food vacuole plasmepsins (28Istvan E.S. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6890-6896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). They form a loop and are buried at the dimer interface in PM II crystal structures but would be exposed when PM II exists as a monomer in solution (Fig. 5). Interestingly, cathepsin E, a mammalian ortholog of the plasmepsins that can cleave hemoglobin only after denaturation, has a different sequence (PVDGEYAVECA) at the corresponding site. If the hydrophobic loop of PM II is essential for its hemoglobinase activity, replacement of the loop by the corresponding cathepsin E sequence would be predicted to abolish the hemoglobin degradation activity of PM II. On the other hand, the degradation of small peptide substrate should not be affected by this replacement if the mutation does not affect the refolding of the enzyme adversely. We constructed a chimeric aspartic protease based on PM II, with the hydrophobic loop replaced with the sequence from cathepsin E. As shown in Fig. 6A, peptide-cleavage kinetics of the PM II-cathepsin E chimera was comparable with those of wild-type PM II. This suggests that the distal loop does not contribute to the mechanism of peptide bond hydrolysis. The chimera was also capable of cleaving isolated hemoglobin α-chains, which are less tightly folded than in the tetramer (Fig. 6B). However, the chimera was dramatically compromised in its ability to cleave intact hemoglobin (Fig. 6, C and D). The data suggest that this loop is crucial for the ability of plasmepsins to degrade native hemoglobin. Addition of the PM II D34S/D214S double mutant in excess had no effect on hemoglobin degradation (data not shown). This suggests that dimer formation is not critical for efficient hemoglobin degradation and further supports the notion that dimer formation does not happen in solution, because the loop is buried in the crystallographic dimer. The existence of multimers in a crystal structure is often an indication that a similar complex can form in solution. This is not a universal rule, and certain examples exist where complexes formed in a particular crystallization condition do not exist in solution. In the current case, PM II is a dimer in all known crystal structures. Nevertheless, there is no detectable dimer in solution, using conditions under which the enzyme is active. Our evidence for this includes gel filtration fractionation and sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation. Some aggregates formed irreversibly in these analyses, but the rest was monomer in each case, with and without ligand. Consistent with this finding, activity appears to reside in the monomer because the monomer gel filtration peak was fully active and because catalytically dead enzyme could not diminish activity of wild-type enzyme by heterodimerization. This finding has important implications for understanding how PM II works. PM II is capable of cleaving hemoglobin at acidic pH between Phe-33 and Leu-34. Cleavage at this position facilitates further unfolding of hemoglobin and increases its accessibility to other food vacuole proteases (4Goldberg D.E. Sullivan D. Krishna S. Malaria: Drugs, Disease, and Post-Genomic Biology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin and Heidelberg2005: 275Google Scholar). In the available neutral pH structures of hemoglobin, Phe-33 and Leu-34 are buried in the B helix of the α-chain and are not accessible to solvent. It is not established how low pH affects the structure of hemoglobin, particularly at the B helix of the α-chain. However, proteases such as cathepsin E cannot cleave hemoglobin at pH 5 even though they readily cleave isolated (less tightly folded) α-chains well (28Istvan E.S. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6890-6896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), suggesting limited availability in tetrameric hemoglobin. We propose that the loop residues that contribute to the highly conserved dimer interface observed in all available plasmepsin crystal structures may comprise a protein-protein interaction motif. When plasmepsin is the sole molecule in solution, dimers can form under molecularly crowded conditions (crystallization). However, in the context of the food vacuole, the hydrophobic loop of the plasmepsin monomer could interact with and possibly intercalate into the hemoglobin substrate. This interaction may open the B helix of hemoglobin, exposing the Phe-33-Leu-34 peptide bond for hydrolysis. The action of the plasmepsin hydrophobic loop differs from the recently reported hemoglobin recognition motif in falcipains, the other food vacuole hemoglobinase family (30Pandey K.C. Wang S.X.

The latter loop confers ability of falcipains to bind and cleave hemoglobin or denatured globin. Its function is presumably in substrate recognition. In contrast, the plasmepsin loop appears to be involved in substrate accessibility for catalysis. Perhaps it works by stretching the globin helix to expose the scissile bond. In this regard it is notable that the B helix of the α-chain of hemoglobin is a weak α helix, possessing two destabilizing glycines in the helix. Most proteases are unable to cleave intact hemoglobin until substrate denaturation has occurred. Thus, it will be interesting to further explore the mechanism of this hemoglobinase.

Both are hexameric proteins comprising one A-subunit and five B-subunits. The pentameric B-subunit of E. coli has a high affinity for G(M1)-ganglioside receptors on gut epithelial cells and is directly responsible for toxin entry. The pentameric B-subunit (EtxB(5)) is an exceptionally stable protein, being able to maintain its quaternary structure over a wide pH range (2.0- 11.0). However, little is known about the formation of the pentameric structure (EtxB(5)) from newly synthesized B-subunit monomers (EtxB(1)). We previously described and characterized a mAb (LDS47) that was shown to be highly specific for an N-terminal decapeptide region of EtxB(1) (Amin, T., Larkins, A., James, R. F. L., and Hirst, T. R. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 20143-20150). Here we also describe a mAb (LDS16) with exquisite specificity for pentameric EtxB. In this study, we have used these two mAbs, in combination, to probe the in vitro assembly of EtxB(5) from EtxB(1). EtxB pentamers disassemble in highly acidic conditions, giving rise to monomeric B-subunits that can reassemble if placed in buffers of neutral pH. Using this in vitro assembly model, it was found that at a molar ratio of 1:1; LDS47:EtxB, 50% of reassembly was inhibited, and that this inhibition increased to 90% at a ratio of 2:1. These results infer that the N-terminal decapeptide region (APQSITELCS) defined by the LDS47 antibody is crucial for competent pentameric B-subunit assembly and stabilization."
https://openalex.org/W2047115841,"Plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL) is inversely associated with the development of atherosclerosis. HDL exerts its atheroprotective role through involvement in reverse cholesterol transport in which HDL is loaded with cholesterol at the periphery and transports its lipid load back to the liver for disposal. In this pathway, HDL is not completely dismantled but only transfers its lipids to the cell. Here we present evidence that a Chinese hamster ovarian cell line (CHO7) adapted to grow in lipoprotein-deficient media degrades HDL and concomitantly internalizes HDL-derived cholesterol. Delivery of HDL cholesterol to the cell was demonstrated by a down-regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis, an increase in total cellular cholesterol content and by stimulation of cholesterol esterification after HDL treatment. This HDL degradation pathway is distinct from the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor pathway but also degrades LDL. 25-Hydroxycholesterol, a potent inhibitor of the LDL receptor pathway, down-regulated LDL degradation in CHO7 cells only in part and did not down-regulate HDL degradation.

The involvement of heparan sulfate proteoglycans and lipases in this HDL degradation was further tested by two inhibitors genistein and tetrahydrolipstatin.

The atheroprotective effect of HDL is mainly due to its role in reverse cholesterol transport by which HDL removes excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues (2Tall A.R. J. Clin.

Circulation. 1994; 89: 2525-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), consistent with its atheroprotective function. In addition, HDL delivers cholesterol directly to steroidogenic tissues for steroid hormone synthesis and for storage in cholesteryl ester droplets (14Gwynne J.T. Strauss J.F. II I Endocr. Rev. 1982; 3: 299-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 16Plump A.S. Erickson S.K. Weng W. Partin J.S. Breslow J.L. Williams D.L. J. Clin.

The role of HDL in reverse cholesterol transport relies on the specific interaction with both peripheral and hepatic cells, but the mechanisms of cholesterol and cholesteryl ester exchange between cells and HDL are incompletely understood. Receptor-independent and receptor-dependent processes have been proposed to explain the transfer of cholesterol and cholesteryl ester between cell surfaces and HDL particles (6Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 211-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the receptor-independent model, diffusion is thought to account for both uptake of cholesteryl ester and efflux of free cholesterol. Diffusion, however, is considered to be relatively inefficient (3Johnson W.J. Mahlberg F.H. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1085: 273-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Evidence for the existence of several “HDL receptors” came from the fact that HDL binds to a variety of cells with varying degrees of specificity (for reviews, see Refs. 17Krieger M. Annu. Rev.

Selective cholesteryl ester uptake mediated by SR-BI is a key mechanism in receptor-mediated delivery of HDL cholesteryl esters to liver and steroidogenic tissues. In this process, only cholesteryl esters of HDL particles but not apolipoproteins are transferred to cells (9Glass C. Pittman R.C. Civen M. Steinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 744-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Glass C. Pittman R.C. Weinstein D.B. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5435-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). This mechanism is distinct from the well characterized LDL receptor pathway, in which LDL is internalized by coated pits after binding to the LDL receptor and directed to lysosomes for particle degradation (33Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4332) Google Scholar). In both pathways, cholesterol is delivered to the endoplasmic reticulum, where excess cholesterol is esterified by acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase. In contrast to the selective uptake of HDL-derived cholesteryl ester by SR-BI, several alternative holo-HDL uptake pathways exist. First, an apoE-independent uptake and resecretion pathway for holo-HDL has been described by several investigators (34Bierman E.L. Stein O. Stein Y. Circ.

Recently, SR-BI was identified as a receptor facilitating this HDL uptake, which is followed by retroendocytosis without degradation of HDL particles (37Silver D.L. Wang N. Xiao X. Tall A.R. J. Biol.

Recent studies in rodent models of genetic obesity suggest that leptin participates in the regulation of plasma HDL levels in part by stimulating holo-HDL uptake by liver cells (40Silver D.L. Wang N.

Second, apoE-associated HDL is taken up by cells via the B/E receptors and is degraded. Interestingly, apoE recycling has been reported to occur in hepatocytes and macrophages, where a part of the apoE associated with HDL escapes degradation (42Heeren J. Grewal T. Laatsch A. Rottke D.

Third, the cubilin/amnionless-megalin receptor complex can mediate endocytosis of both HDL (binding to cubilin) and LDL (binding to megalin) in the proximal convoluted tubule of the kidney and the visceral yolk sac (21Kozyraki R. Fyfe J. Kristiansen M. Gerdes C. Jacobsen C. Cui S. Christensen E.I. de la Aminoff M. Chapelle A. Krahe R. Verroust P.J. Moestrup S.K. Nat.

Gerdes C. Jacobsen C. Cui S. Christensen E.I. de la Aminoff M. Chapelle A. Krahe R. Verroust P.J. Moestrup S.K. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 656-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 23Moestrup S.K. Nielsen L.B. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2005; 16: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), both receptors have been reported to play a role in the delivery of nutrients like cholesterol from the maternal to the fetal side (23Moestrup S.K. Nielsen L.B. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2005; 16: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 45Assemat E. Vinot S. Gofflot F. Linsel-Nitschke P. Illien F. Chatelet F. Verroust P. Louvet-Vallee S.

Although the clearance of apoA-I by the kidney and the uptake of apoE-containing HDL via the LDL receptor family are well established, many other facets of HDL catabolism are still incompletely understood. The aim of the present work was to study how a line of CHO cells (CHO7) specifically adapted for continuous growth in lipoprotein-poor medium in the laboratory of Drs. Brown and Goldstein (46Metherall J.E. Goldstein J.L. Luskey K.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15634-15641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), survives in this medium with almost no external cholesterol. In this work, we present evidence that the CHO7 cells actively degrade HDL as well as LDL for cholesterol supply. Cholesterol delivery is demonstrated by an increase of the cellular cholesterol content leading to a down-regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis and a stimulation of cholesterol esterification after incubation with HDL. In addition, HDL associated with cells can be released by dextran sulfate, and the protein(s) responsible for this HDL degradation are in part released by heparin treatment. Furthermore, when we used the two inhibitors, genistein and tetrahydrolipstatin (THL), blocking heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) or lipoprotein lipase activity, respectively, a marked reduction in HDL degradation was seen. Finally, HDL degradation with similar properties was present in a human placental cell line. Taken together, the pathway of lipoprotein degradation and cholesterol delivery to cells described here is clearly distinct from the known HDL uptake pathways as well as from the receptor-mediated endocytosis via the LDL receptor. Cell Lines and Treatment—Two Chinese hamster ovarian cell lines, CHOKI and CHO7, were used; CHO7 cells were derived from CHOKI cells through propagation in lipid-deficient serum (46Metherall J.E. Goldstein J.L. Luskey K.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15634-15641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For all experiments, cells were plated in 6-well plates at a cell density of 300,000 cells/well in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM) and Ham's F-12 medium (medium A) with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate, supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Invitrogen) for CHOKI or 5% human lipoprotein-deficient serum (HLPDS) for CHO7. On day 2, CHOKI cells were switched to medium A containing 5% (v/v) HLPDS, and all cells were treated with 10 μm compactin and 100 μm mevalonate for 24 h except when stated otherwise. On day 3, cells were washed with PBS and refed with medium A supplemented with 2 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (faf-BSA; Sigma). For inhibitor treatment, cells were preincubated for 15 min before the addition of lipoproteins. The BeWo choriocarcinoma cell line (ATCC, Manassas, VA) was cultured in F12K (Kaighn's modification) nutrient mixture (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (hyClone) containing 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin and 2 mml-glutamine at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Lipoprotein Preparation and Labeling—Plasma was collected from normolipidemic volunteers, and lipoproteins were obtained by serial ultracentrifugation. LDL was recovered at a density of 1.019 g/ml, and HDL was recovered at a density of 1.21 g/ml. The HDL used did not contain any detectable apoE, as demonstrated by SDS gel electrophoresis and subsequent silver staining. The apolipoprotein part of lipoproteins was covalently labeled with either Alexa 647 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) or Cy3 (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's description (Molecular Probes). The lipid part of HDL particles was labeled with the fluorescent phospholipid DiI (Molecular Probes). The labeling procedure included incubation of HDL, diluted in lipoprotein-deficient serum, with DiI overnight at 37 °C followed by ultracentrifugation (47Pitas R.E. Innerarity T.L. Weinstein J.N. Mahley R.W. Arteriosclerosis. 1981; 1: 177-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For double labeling, DiI-HDL particles were conjugated with Alexa 647. For electron microscopy, HDL particles were covalently labeled with peroxidase using a peroxidase labeling kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Lipoproteins were iodinated with sodium (125) iodide (Hartmann Analytic, Braunschweig, Germany) using the Pierce IODO-BEADS iodination reagent kit. The labeling procedure resulted in a specific activity of the lipoprotein particles of ∼2000 cpm/ng. For the experiments, lipoproteins were diluted 1:10 with unlabeled lipoprotein. Measurement of Cholesterol Esterification—Cells were prepared as described above. On day 3, cells were switched to media A with the addition of 2 mg/ml faf-BSA and the indicated concentrations of HDL or LDL. After 5 h, cells were pulsed with 0.2 mm [14C]oleate (∼10,000 dpm/nmol; Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h and afterward washed three times with buffer A (50 mm Tris, 0.9% NaCl, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) and once with buffer B (50 mm Tris and 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.4). Lipids were extracted twice from cell monolayers with hexane/isopropyl alcohol (3:2) and analyzed by TLC (Silica Gel G) (48Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). For protein analysis, the cells were dissolved in 0.1 m NaOH. Protein concentration was estimated using the Bradford Reagent (Bio-Rad). Data are presented in pmol of cholesteryl [14C]oleate/mg of cell protein. Assay of 125I-HDL or 125I-LDL Degradation—Cells were grown and treated as described above. On day 3, cells were incubated with iodinated lipoproteins for the indicated time, media were collected, and proteins were precipitated using 50% trichloroacetic acid. To remove the free iodine, the supernatant was oxidized with hydrogen peroxide and extracted with chloroform. The amount of radioactivity in the aqueous phase was quantitated with a Cobra II γ-counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to determine the amount of acid-soluble material formed (which is almost exclusively [125I]iodotyrosine) (48Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). Specific degradation, representing cell-dependent proteolysis, is expressed in ng of 125I-labeled, acid-soluble protein fragments formed per mg of total cell protein. Specific degradation was calculated as the difference between total and nonspecific degradation, estimated by using a 40-fold excess of unlabeled lipoprotein. Measurement of Cholesterol Biosynthesis—Cells were grown and prepared as described before; on day 3, cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of HDL, LDL, or 25-hydroxycholesterol (1 μg/ml), as control, in medium A containing faf-BSA with 5 μCi of [14C]acetate (45 mm) for 7 h. Afterward, cells were washed, and lipids were extracted and analyzed using TLC as described for cholesterol esterification. The amounts of cholesterol, cholesteryl ester, fatty acids, and triglycerides synthesized by the cells were analyzed by scintillation counting and expressed as pmol/mg of cell protein. Determination of Cellular Cholesterol and Cholesteryl Ester Content—Cells were grown and treated as described above. After incubation with or without lipoproteins, cells were washed twice with buffer A and once with buffer B. Lipids were extracted directly on the dish using hexane/isopropyl alcohol (3:2) after the addition of the internal standards tricarprin (50 μg/dish, tridecanoyl glycerol; Sigma) and cholesteryl-heptadecanoate (4 μg/dish; Sigma). The solvent was evaporated, and lipids were dissolved in chloroform. Determination of cholesterol and cholesteryl esters was performed by capillary gas chromatography as described by Lohninger et al. (49Lohninger A. Preis P. Linhart L. Sommoggy S.V. Landau M. Kaiser E. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 186: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The analyses were carried out on the GC 800 Top gas chromatograph (CE Instruments, Thermo Quest Italia S.p.A., Rodano, Italy) equipped with a programmed temperature vaporizer injector. A capillary glass liner was inserted into the vaporizer block of the programmed temperature vaporizer injection system. Three-meter (0.25-mm inner diameter) fused silica capillary columns with chemically bonded DB-5 (0.1-μm coating thickness; J & W Scientific, Folsom, CA) were used for all analyses. Hydrogen was used as carrier gas at 0.4 bar (8–10 ml/min flow rate) and nitrogen as the make-up gas. The flame ionization detector temperature was kept at 380 °C. Air and hydrogen flows were adjusted to give maximum detector response. Before use, the column was conditioned at 350 °C. The gas chromatographic system was calibrated with a mixture of standards. For determination of cholesterol and cholesteryl esters, the oven temperature was programmed from 180 to 278 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min and from 278 to 340 °C at a rate of 8 °C/min. During the first 2 min of each run, the oven temperature was kept at 180 °C, and the split system was turned off in an appropriate range after 45 s and returned after 120 s to enable the cholesterol and cholesteryl esters to reach the capillary column quantitatively. Data were analyzed using the Chrom-Card program. Results are expressed in μg/mg of cell protein. HDL Retroendocytosis—Association, uptake, and resecretion of HDL particles in CHO7 and CHOK1 cells were studied as reported earlier (36DeLamatre J.G. Sarphie T.G. Archibold R.C. Hornick C.A. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 191-202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Pagler T.A. Rhode S. Neuhofer A. Laggner H. Strobl W. Hinterndorfer C. Volf I. Pavelka M. van der Eckhardt E.R. Westhuyzen D.R. Schutz G.J. Stangl H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11193-11204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded in 6-well plates and grown for 2 days in medium A with 5% FCS. Medium was changed to medium A containing HLPDS for 24 h. On the experimental day, cells were washed with PBS and incubated in DMEM containing 2 mg/ml faf-BSA for 1 h at 37°C with 10 μg/ml 125I-HDL in duplicates. To measure association, medium was withdrawn, and cells were washed twice with buffer A and B and then lysed using 0.1 m NaOH. The cell lysate was analyzed for its content of radiolabel using a Cobra II γ-counter (PerkinElmer). Specific binding was calculated by subtracting cell association derived from cells incubated with a 40-fold excess of unlabeled HDL before the addition of 125I-HDL. For determination of HDL uptake, a subset of cells was washed after the initial association step and further incubated at 0 °C for 2 h with the addition of a 50-fold excess of unlabeled lipoprotein. This displacement treatment provides the removal of surface-bound HDL particles, leaving only internalized HDL with the cells. Again, media were removed, and cells were washed, lysed, and analyzed. To study the resecretion of HDL particles, another subset of cells was warmed to 37 °C after the displacement procedure and incubated for 30 min with a 20-fold excess of unlabeled HDL. Subsequently, cells were treated as described above, and the amount of radiolabel remaining within the cells was determined. Cell protein was measured using the Bradford Reagent (Bio-Rad). The specific cell association, uptake, and resecretion of HDL particles were calculated in ng of HDL/mg of cell protein by subtraction of unspecific binding. Ultrasensitive Fluorescence Microscopy—CHO7 and CHOKI cells were maintained on collagenized coverslips in 12-well dishes seeded at a cell density of 15,000 cells/well. Cells were grown for 2 days and then washed with PBS and incubated with DMEM containing 5% (v/v) HLPDS, 10 μm compactin, and 100 μm mevalonate for 24 h. For the experimental procedure, cells were washed with PBS and switched to DMEM containing 2 mg/ml faf-BSA with either Alexa 647-DiI-HDL or Cy3-LDL (1 μg/ml) for 30 min. For imaging fluorescence-labeled lipoproteins, an epifluorescence microscope (Axiovert 200 TV; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) was used as described previously (38Rhode S. Breuer A. Hesse J. Sonnleitner M. Pagler T.A. Doringer M. Schutz G.J. Stangl H. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 41: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Large areas on the coverslip were recorded with a wide field scanning setup developed recently (50Hesse J. Sonnleitner M. Sonnleitner A. Freudenthaler G. Jacak J. Hoglinger O. Schindler H. Schutz G.J. Anal. Chem. 2004; 76: 5960-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Alexa 647 was excited with a 647-nm light from a krypton laser (Innova 300; Coherent, Santa Clara, CA), and the 514-nm line of an argon laser (2020 series; Spectra Physics, Mountain View, CA) was used for Cy3 and DiI excitation. Emitted fluorescence was collected using appropriate filter combinations and an oil ×100 immersion objective (Plan-Apochromat, numerical aperture = 1.45; Zeiss) and was detected by a cooled CCD camera (NTE-CCD 100EB; Princeton Instruments, Trenton, NJ) running in time-delayed integration mode. The sample was mounted on a high precision XY stage (Scan IM 120 × 100; Märzhäuser, Germany). Electron Microscopy—Cells were grown and treated as described above. On day 3, cells were incubated for 1 h in medium A with faf-BSA containing peroxidase-labeled HDL and prepared for electron microscopy. Fixation was performed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, pH 7.4. After an overnight rinse in PBS, peroxidase activities were visualized by the diaminobenzidine reaction (51Pavelka M. Ellinger A. Debbage P. Loewe C. Vetterlein M. Roth J. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 109: 555-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Cells were postfixed in 1% OsO4, dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, and embedded in Epon. Ultrathin sections were analyzed in a transmission electron microscope. For control, cells were incubated in medium containing a similar amount of peroxidase as was contained in the conjugated HDL added. Statistics—Results are expressed as means ± S.D. Data points represent the mean of triplicate values, and experiments were repeated three times if not stated otherwise. Mean values were compared using analysis of variance followed by Newman-Keuls t test: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001. HDL Degradation Occurs in CHO7 C"
