https://openalex.org/W1980042430,"Hepcidin is a peptide hormone secreted by the liver in response to iron loading and inflammation. Decreased hepcidin leads to tissue iron overload, whereas hepcidin overproduction leads to hypoferremia and the anemia of inflammation. Ferroportin is an iron exporter present on the surface of absorptive enterocytes, macrophages, hepatocytes, and placental cells. Here we report that hepcidin bound to ferroportin in tissue culture cells. After binding, ferroportin was internalized and degraded, leading to decreased export of cellular iron. The posttranslational regulation of ferroportin by hepcidin may thus complete a homeostatic loop: Iron regulates the secretion of hepcidin, which in turn controls the concentration of ferroportin on the cell surface."

Existing and proposed mouse resources that are optimized to study the actions of isolated genetic loci on a fixed background are less effective for studying intact polygenic networks and interactions among genes, environments, pathogens and other factors. The Collaborative Cross will provide a common reference panel specifically designed for the integrative analysis of complex systems and will change the way we approach human health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2011812102,"Reduced serotonin transporter (5-HTT) expression is associated with abnormal affective and anxiety-like symptoms in humans and rodents, but the mechanism of this effect is unknown. Transient inhibition of 5-HTT during early development with fluoxetine, a commonly used serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor, produced abnormal emotional behaviors in adult mice. This effect mimicked the behavioral phenotype of mice genetically deficient in 5-HTT expression. These findings indicate a critical role of serotonin in the maturation of brain systems that modulate emotional function in the adult and suggest a developmental mechanism to explain how low-expressing 5-HTT promoter alleles increase vulnerability to psychiatric disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2131399365,"Polar transport–dependent local accumulation of auxin provides positional cues for multiple plant patterning processes. This directional auxin flow depends on the polar subcellular localization of the PIN auxin efflux regulators. Overexpression of the PINOID protein kinase induces a basal-to-apical shift in PIN localization, resulting in the loss of auxin gradients and strong defects in embryo and seedling roots. Conversely, pid loss of function induces an apical-to-basal shift in PIN1 polar targeting at the inflorescence apex, accompanied by defective organogenesis. Our results show that a PINOID-dependent binary switch controls PIN polarity and mediates changes in auxin flow to create local gradients for patterning processes."

The global average methane mixing ratio is found to be 10 +/- 5 parts per billion by volume (ppbv). However, the mixing ratio varies between 0 and 30 ppbv over the planet. The source of methane could be either biogenic or nonbiogenic, including past or present subsurface microorganisms, hydrothermal activity, or cometary impacts."
https://openalex.org/W2077635401,"A strong temperature dependence of oxygen K-edge x-ray absorption fine structure features was observed for supercooled and normal liquid water droplets prepared from the breakup of a liquid microjet. Analysis of the data over the temperature range 251 to 288 kelvin (-22 degrees to +15 degrees C) yields a value of 1.5 +/- 0.5 kilocalories per mole for the average thermal energy required to effect an observable rearrangement between the fully coordinated (""ice-like"") and distorted (""broken-donor"") local hydrogen-bonding configurations responsible for the pre-edge and post-edge features, respectively. This energy equals the latent heat of melting of ice with hexagonal symmetry (ice Ih) and is consistent with the distribution of hydrogen bond strengths obtained for the ""overstructured"" ST2 model of water."
https://openalex.org/W2003054791,"Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are gateways for nucleocytoplasmic exchange. To analyze their structure in a close-to-life state, we studied transport-active, intact nuclei from Dictyostelium discoideum by means of cryoelectron tomography. Subvolumes of the tomograms containing individual NPCs were extracted in silico and subjected to three-dimensional classification and averaging, whereby distinct structural states were observed. The central plug/transporter (CP/T) was variable in volume and could occupy different positions along the nucleocytoplasmic axis, which supports the notion that it essentially represents cargo in transit. Changes in the position of the CP/T were accompanied by structural rearrangements in the NPC scaffold."
https://openalex.org/W2162052651,"We obtained likelihoods in the lower mantle for long-wavelength models of bulk sound and shear wave speed, density, and boundary topography, compatible with gravity constraints, from normal mode splitting functions and surface wave data. Taking into account the large uncertainties in Earth's thermodynamic reference state and the published range of mineral physics data, we converted the tomographic likelihoods into probability density functions for temperature, perovskite, and iron variations. Temperature and composition can be separated, showing that chemical variations contribute to the overall buoyancy and are dominant in the lower 1000 kilometers of the mantle."
https://openalex.org/W2094217838,"For vision, insect and vertebrate eyes use rhabdomeric and ciliary photoreceptor cells, respectively. These cells show distinct architecture and transduce the light signal by different phototransductory cascades. In the marine rag-worm Platynereis , we find both cell types: rhabdomeric photoreceptor cells in the eyes and ciliary photoreceptor cells in the brain. The latter use a photopigment closely related to vertebrate rod and cone opsins. Comparative analysis indicates that both types of photoreceptors, with distinct opsins, coexisted in Urbilateria, the last common ancestor of insects and vertebrates, and sheds new light on vertebrate eye evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2099640515,"Coexistence of cooperators and defectors is common in nature, yet the evolutionary origin of such social diversification is unclear. Many models have been studied on the basis of the assumption that benefits of cooperative acts only accrue to others. Here, we analyze the continuous snowdrift game, in which cooperative investments are costly but yield benefits to others as well as to the cooperator. Adaptive dynamics of investment levels often result in evolutionary diversification from initially uniform populations to a stable state in which cooperators making large investments coexist with defectors who invest very little. Thus, when individuals benefit from their own actions, large asymmetries in cooperative investments can evolve."
https://openalex.org/W2083700985,"The prefrontal cortex is a higher brain region that regulates thought, behavior, and emotion using representational knowledge, operations often referred to as working memory. We tested the influence of protein kinase C (PKC) intracellular signaling on prefrontal cortical cognitive function and showed that high levels of PKC activity in prefrontal cortex, as seen for example during stress exposure, markedly impair behavioral and electrophysiological measures of working memory. These data suggest that excessive PKC activation can disrupt prefrontal cortical regulation of behavior and thought, possibly contributing to signs of prefrontal cortical dysfunction such as distractibility, impaired judgment, impulsivity, and thought disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2047326068,"Rayleigh scattering spectra were obtained from individual single-walled carbon nanotubes with the use of a laser-generated visible and near-infrared supercontinuum. This diagnostic method is noninvasive and general for nanoscale objects. The approach permits clear identification of excited states in arbitrary metallic and semiconducting nanotubes. We analyzed spectral lineshapes in relation to the role of excitonic effects and correlated the results with Raman scattering data on individual tubes. The nanotube structure remained the same over distances of tens of micrometers. Small nanotube bundles retained distinct Rayleigh spectroscopic signatures of their component nanotubes, thus allowing the probing of nanotube-nanotube interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1986177839,"Among birds, the Procellariiform seabirds (petrels, albatrosses, and shearwaters) are prime candidates for using chemical cues for individual recognition. These birds have an excellent olfactory sense, and a variety of species nest in burrows that they can recognize by smell. However, the nature of the olfactory signature--the scent that makes one burrow smell more like home than another--has not been established for any species. Here, we explore the use of intraspecific chemical cues in burrow recognition and present evidence for partner-specific odor recognition in a bird."
https://openalex.org/W2080252996,"Diabetes mellitus is associated with one or more kinds of stimulus-evoked pain including hyperalgesia and allodynia. The mechanisms underlying painful diabetic neuropathy remain poorly understood. Previous studies demonstrate an important role of vanilloid receptor 1 (VR1) in inflammation and injury-induced pain. Here we investigated the function and expression of VR1 in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons isolated from streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats between 4 and 8 weeks after onset of diabetes. DRG neurons from diabetic rats showed significant increases in capsaicin- and proton-activated inward currents. These evoked currents were completely blocked by the capsaicin antagonist capsazepine. Capsaicin-induced desensitization of VR1 was down-regulated, whereas VR1 re-sensitization was up-regulated in DRG neurons from diabetic rats. The protein kinase C (PKC) activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate blunted VR1 desensitization, and this effect was reversible in the presence of the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I. Compared with the controls, VR1 protein was decreased in DRG whole-cell homogenates from diabetic rats, but increased levels of VR1 protein were observed on plasma membranes. Of interest, the tetrameric form of VR1 increased significantly in DRGs from diabetic rats. Increased phosphorylation levels of VR1 were also observed in DRG neurons from diabetic rats. Colocalization studies demonstrated that VR1 expression was increased in large myelinated A-fiber DRG neurons, whereas it was decreased in small unmyelinated C-fiber neurons as a result of diabetes. These results suggest that painful diabetic neuropathy is associated with altered cell-specific expression of the VR1 receptor that is coupled to increased function through PKC-mediated phosphorylation, oligomerization, and targeted expression on the cell surface membrane.

Painful neuropathy is one of the most common complications in early to intermediate stages of diabetes mellitus. Diabetic patients frequently exhibit one or more kinds of stimulus-evoked pain, including increased responsiveness to noxious stimuli (hyperalgesia) as well as a hyper-responsiveness to normally innocuous stimuli (allodynia) that are often concurrent with a paradoxical loss of stimulus-evoked sensation (1Marchettini P.

It has been suggested that hyperactivity of small, unmyelinated C-fibers results in hyperalgesia and allodynia in this model (6Rashid M.H. Inoue M. Bakoshi S. Ueda H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 306: 709-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 7Kamei J. Zushida K. Morita K. Sasaki M. Tanaka S. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 422: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Khan et al. (4Khan G.M. Chen S.R. Pan H.L. Neuroscience. 2002; 114: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) reported that A-fiber afferents in diabetic rats developed abnormal spontaneous discharges and increased sensitivity to mechanical stimuli, suggesting a role of large A-fiber neurons in addition to nociceptive C-fibers in the development of diabetic neuropathic pain. Capsaicin, the pungent ingredient in hot peppers, can induce action potentials, cause cation influx, and release neuropeptides from primary afferent neurons that induce hyperalgesia and inflammation (8Malmberg A.B.

Prolonged or repeated exposure to capsaicin desensitizes nociceptors. Because of this property, capsaicin is used as an analgesic agent in the treatment of various painful disorders (12Szallasi A. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 2002; 118: 110-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 13Szallasi A. Blumberg P.M. Pain. 1996; 68: 195-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The recently cloned capsaicin receptor, vanilloid receptor 1 (VR1, also known as TRPV1), encodes a protein of 838 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 95 kDa that specifically localizes to small-sized, unmyelinated C-fiber (nociceptive) sensory neurons (14Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (6875) Google Scholar). VR1 is a polymodal ligand-gated cation channel that can be activated by vanilloids, noxious heat, and protons (14Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (6875) Google Scholar, 15Jordt S.E. Tominaga M. Julius D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Studies with VR1-deficient mice demonstrate that the VR1 channel is essential for selective modalities of thermal hyperalgesia induced by tissue injury and inflammation, supporting the hypothesis that VR1 is a molecular integrator of painful stimuli (17Caterina M.J. Leffler A. Malmberg A.B. Martin W.J. Trafton J. Petersen-Zeitz K.R. Koltzenburg M. Basbaum A.I. Julius D. Science. 2000; 288: 306-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (2845) Google Scholar, 18Davis J.B. Gray J.

Neurosci. 2000; 12: 171Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). More supporting evidence comes from the study demonstrating that administration of the competitive capsaicin antagonist capsazepine reverses hyperalgesia in models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain (19Walker K.M. Urban L. Medhurst S.J. Patel S. Panesar M. Fox A.J. McIntyre P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 304: 56-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Like many ion channels, the function of the VR1 channel is modulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation processes. Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) induces VR1 activity in the absence of any other agonist and potentiates the response of VR1 to capsaicin (20Crandall M. Kwash J. Yu W.F. White G. Pain. 2002; 98: 109-117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 21Premkumar L.S. Ahern G.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 985-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). In sensory neurons the capsaicin response is also potentiated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase that directly phosphorylates VR1 and reduces its desensitization (22Bhave G. Zhu W.G. Wang H.B. Brasier D.J. Oxford G.S. Gereau R.W. Neuron. 2002; 35: 721-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of VR1 protein expression has also been observed in nerve injury-induced pain (23Hudson L.J. Bevan S. Wotherspoon G. Gentry C. Fox A. Winter J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 13: 2105-2114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying the modulation of VR1 expression and function are unknown in neuropathic pain associated with diabetic neuropathy. Here we employed STZ-induced diabetic rats as a model to investigate the expression and function of the VR1 channel that is associated with thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia. We observed that VR1 protein levels were down-regulated, whereas the function of VR1 channels was up-regulated in DRG neurons isolated from early diabetic rats. The increase in capsaicin-induced VR1 currents was potentiated by activation of PKC, antagonized by a PKC inhibitor, and correlated with increased oligomerization and phosphorylation of VR1 receptors and increased expression on the cell surface membrane. Experimental Animals—Male Sprague-Dawley rats were housed in the animal facility of the University of Michigan Unit for Laboratory Animal Medicine, which was maintained at 22 °C, 55% relative humidity, with an automatic 12-h light/dark cycle. The animals received a standard laboratory diet and tap water ad libitum. All experiments were approved by the University of Michigan Committee on Use and Care of Animals according to the National Institutes of Health guidelines. Diabetes Induced by STZ—Diabetes mellitus was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of STZ (45 mg/kg) to 180-200-g rats that had been fasted overnight to maximize the effectiveness of STZ treatment. STZ solution was prepared fresh by dissolving it in 0.1 m citrate buffer, pH 5.5. Age-matched control rats were injected with citrate buffer alone. The diabetic condition was assessed by glucose levels greater than 300 mg/dl (16.7 mm). Rats meeting this criterion were used experimentally 4-8 weeks after STZ induction. Our previous studies with this model demonstrated that rats with diabetes for 4-8 weeks displayed a variety of functional abnormalities, including delayed nerve conduction velocity, an increase in calcium influx, impaired inhibitory G protein function, impaired mitochondrial function, and activation of the apoptosis cascade in DRG neurons. These effects are reversible following 2 weeks of insulin-mediated euglycemia (24Srinivasan S. Stevens M. Wiley J.W. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1932-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 25Barber A.J. Lieth E. Khin S.A. Antonetti D.A. Buchanan A.G. Gardner T.W. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). This model also demonstrated thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia (5Hong S. Morrow T.J. Paulson P.E. Isom L.L. Wiley J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29341-29350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Neuronal Dissociation—DRG neurons were prepared as described previously (5Hong S. Morrow T.J. Paulson P.E. Isom L.L. Wiley J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29341-29350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Briefly, L1-L6 DRGs in the lumbar region of the spinal column were removed bilaterally from diabetic and control rats. The acutely dissociated ganglia were incubated for 50 min at 37 °C in 0.3% collagenase (Worthington type 2) in minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 16.5 mm NaHCO3 and 28.2 mm glucose (M-MEM). This was followed by incubation in 0.1% trypsin (type 1, Sigma) for 10 min at 37 °C. After washing three times, cells were resuspended in M-MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and plated on 35-mm sterile culture dishes that were previously coated with calf collagen. Isolated neurons were incubated in 95% air + 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 2-7 h prior to electrophysiological recording. In some experiments, neurons were cultured for 24-48 h in the presence of nerve growth factor (50 ng/ml) for immunofluorescence staining. Electrophysiology—Patch clamp recordings were performed under the whole-cell mode at room temperature (20-23 °C). Glass electrodes with 1-1.5 megohms resistance were pulled from filamented borosilicate glass using a horizontal puller (P-87; Sutter Instruments) and were fire-polished immediately before the experiment. Standard bath solution for whole-cell recordings contained (in mm) 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, pH 7.4 (adjusted with NaOH). In some experiments, MES-based solution was used to adjust the pH to 5.0. The internal solution consisted of (in mm) 140 CsCl, 5 EGTA, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4. All solutions were made fresh daily and filtered at 0.2 μm immediately before use. For the experiments testing the effects of pH and capsaicin, solutions were applied locally and rapidly (1-20 s duration) to the neurons of interest by using silica 28-gauge syringes of 0.25-mm inner diameter (World Precision Instruments). Working capsaicin solutions were prepared fresh from a 10 mm capsaicin stock solution dissolved in ethanol using extracellular solution with a negligible effect on channel function (26Trevisani M. Smart D. Gunthorpe M.J. Tognetto M. Barbieri M. Campi B. Amadesi S. Gray J. Jerman J.C. Brough S.J. Owen D. Smith G.D. Randall A.D. Harrison S. Bianchi A. Davis J.B. Geppetti P. Nature Neuroscience. 2002; 5: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Small-sized neurons with cell capacitance less than 35 pF were voltage-clamped at -80 mV, and pipette resistance was compensated as necessary. Data were acquired using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc.), low pass filtered at 5 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz through a Digidata 1322A 16-bit data acquisition system, and recorded with pClamp version 8.2 software (Axon Instruments, Inc.). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Immunoprecipitation was conducted as described previously (27Kedei N. Szabo T. Lile J.D. Treanor J.J. Olah Z. Iadarola M.J. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28613-28619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Briefly, L1-L6 DRGs from control and diabetic rats were isolated and homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10% v/v glycerol, 1% v/v Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, and “Complete” protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). Immunoprecipitation was performed using rabbit anti-VR1 antibodies (1:50, Neuromics) or anti-phosphoserine antibodies (1:40, Chemicon). The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on 4-15% Tris-HCl gels and transblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences). In some experiments, crude DRG homogenates and enriched plasma membrane preparations were separated by electrophoresis. The polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin for 12 h and incubated with the following primary antibodies: anti-VR1 antibody (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-phosphoserine antibody (1:500) overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature and developed using the West Dura Supersignal chemiluminescence kit (Pierce). The corresponding bands were scanned at 1200 dots per inch and semiquantified with ImageJ software from the National Institutes of Health. Plasma Membrane Extraction and PFO-PAGE—Plasma membrane proteins were extracted by using an aqueous two-phase polymer system of dextran-polyethylene glycol (MBL International Corp., Woburn, MA) as described previously (28Funakoshi I. Yamashina I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1976; 80: 1185-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 29Hui S.W. Stoicheva N. Zhao Y.L. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 1123-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Briefly, after the preparation of total DRG extracts, the homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the pellets containing proteins from both the plasma membrane and cellular organelle membranes were suspended using 200 μl of upper phase solution provided followed by mixture with 200 μl of lower phase solution. After incubation on ice for 5 min, the mixture was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min, and the upper phase was collected and mixed with 100 μl of lower phase solution. After centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min, the upper phase was mixed with 5 volumes of ice-cold double distilled H2O and incubated on ice for 5 min. The mixture was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellets contained enriched plasma membrane proteins. Plasma membrane proteins were separated using PFO-PAGE to detect the native structure of VR1 as described previously (27Kedei N. Szabo T. Lile J.D. Treanor J.J. Olah Z. Iadarola M.J. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28613-28619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Briefly, freshly poured 6% Tris-HCl gels containing 0.1% NaPFO (Oakwood Products Inc., West Columbia, CA) but without SDS were used. Crude DRG homogenates and enriched plasma membrane preparations were mixed with 2× sample buffer (100 mm Tris, 6% NaPFO, 20% glycerol, 20% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8). After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, the sample mixtures were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min to remove insoluble debris before loading onto gels for electrophoresis. The running buffer contained 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 0.5% NaPFO, pH 8.5. The immunoblotting was performed as described above. Immunofluorescence Staining—The animals were anesthetized with halothane and transcardially perfused with ice-cold saline solution. L1-L6 DRGs of the spinal column were acutely removed and postfixed for 2-3 h in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline. The fixed DRGs were then cryoprotected, cut on a cryostat at 6 μm thickness, and mounted serially onto Superfrost/plus microscope slides (Fisher) for staining as described previously (5Hong S.

After incubating in 0.3% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBST) for 2 h, the sections were blocked in 10% goat serum in PBST at least for 4 h, followed by incubation with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibodies were used at the following dilutions: goat anti-VR1 (carboxyl-terminal; 1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); goat anti-VR1 (amino-terminal; 1:300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); rabbit anti-VR1 (carboxyl-terminal; 1:1,000, Neuromics); rabbit anti-VRL1 (1:200, Chemicon); mouse anti-peripherin (1:200, Chemicon); mouse anti-NF200 (N52 clone; 1:500, Sigma). In the experiments utilizing goat-derived primary antibodies, the sections were blocked in 10% donkey serum in PBST. After washing three times with PBST, the sections were incubated with secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) at the following dilutions: goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (1:400), goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 (1:500), or donkey anti-goat Alexa Fluor 594 (1:400). The sections were then washed three times, mounted using an anti-fade fluorescence mounting medium, and analyzed by confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM510) or a fluorescence microscope. Data Analysis—For each series of experiments, immunostained DRG sections were viewed under a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescence microscope, and digitized images were acquired covering the entire DRG in one field under low magnification. Images from 4 to 8 different experimental series were pooled for counting in each group. Neurons were judged to be positive if they had mean brightness values greater than the corresponding control value stained with the secondary antibody alone. The average staining intensity was determined for each cell body. Significance was analyzed by Student's t test. Diabetic Neuropathy Is Associated with Increased Capsaicin-induced Current—Two days after injection of STZ, 75% of the rats developed high levels of blood glucose (mean level = 475 ± 16 mg/dl), whereas untreated rats had normal levels (mean level = 83 ± 7 mg/dl). The elevated level of blood glucose in STZ-injected rats was maintained during the entire experimental period. These results are very similar to our previous studies (5Hong S. Morrow T.J. Paulson P.E. Isom L.L. Wiley J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29341-29350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 30Hall K.E. Liu J. Sima A.A. Wiley J.W. J. Neurophysiol. 2001; 86: 760-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). As reported previously (5Hong S. Morrow T.J. Paulson P.E. Isom L.L. Wiley J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29341-29350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), diabetic rats demonstrated a significant reduction in the threshold for escape from innocuous mechanical pressure (allodynia) and a reduction in the latency to withdrawal from a noxious thermal stimulus (hyperalgesia). To investigate the function of VR1 receptors in diabetic rats, whole-cell currents activated by capsaicin were recorded in whole-cell mode using acutely dissociated DRG neurons. The average cell membrane capacitance was 25.3 ± 2.2 pF (n = 42) in control rats and 25.9 ± 3.0 pF (n = 50) in the diabetic group. Provided that the cells have a spherical shape, the mean capacitance corresponds to a cell diameter of 28.2 ± 2.4 μm in control rats and 28.6 ± 3.3 μm in diabetic rats, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1A, the inward current activated by the application of capsaicin (1 μm, 2 s) was significantly larger in neurons from diabetic rats compared with controls. The mean peak current density of capsaicin-induced currents was 372.6 ± 32.1 pA/pF (n = 15) in diabetic neurons and 256.5 ± 22.8 pA/pF (n = 18) in controls, respectively. This peak current amplitude was increased 45% in diabetic rats compared with the control group, and the difference between these two values was significant (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1B). Compared with controls, the whole-cell inward current activated by capsaicin also displayed a longer duration in DRG neurons from diabetic rats. The average duration of whole-cell current activated by capsaicin was 28.9 ± 5.6 s (n = 14) in control rats and 83.7 ± 17.6 s (n = 15) in diabetic rats, respectively. The duration of inward current was increased ∼2-fold in diabetic rats compared with the control group (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1B). Moreover, capsazepine, a competitive capsaicin antagonist, blocked capsaicin-induced inward currents almost completely in DRG neurons from both control and diabetic rats. Fig. 1C shows the neurons from control and diabetic rats that did not respond to capsaicin (1 μm, 2 s) in the presence of 10 μm capsazepine (n = 6). This result indicates that the capsaicin-binding gate of VR1 receptors is not altered in DRG neurons of diabetic rats. Increased Low pH-evoked Currents in DRG Neurons from Diabetic Rats—As the VR1 receptor can be activated by low pH as well as capsaicin (31Caterina M.J. Julius D. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar), we recorded whole-cell currents activated by delivering the bath solution at a low pH (5.0). Fig. 2A shows representative currents evoked by pH 5.0 in the absence or presence of capsazepine (10 μm) in DRG neurons from control and diabetic rats. Low pH bath solution (2-s application) evoked large inward currents in DRG neurons from both control and diabetic rats. The peak amplitude of low pH-evoked whole-cell current was 255.2 ± 29.2 pA/pF (n = 10) in control rats and 365.3 ± 32.6 pA/pF (n = 11) in diabetic rats, respectively. The level of inward current was increased 43% in diabetic rats compared with the control group, and the difference between them was significant (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2B). The low pH-evoked inward currents were blocked by capsazepine (Fig. 2A). In the presence of capsazepine (10 μm), the low pH-evoked inward current was substantially reduced in DRG neurons from both control and diabetic rats. The peak current density of pH-evoked current was 10.3 ± 1.3 pA/pF (n = 12) in control rats and 12.1 ± 2.2 pA/pF (n = 12) in diabetic rats, respectively (Fig. 2B). Compared with the inward current in the absence of capsazepine, 96% of the pH-activated current was blocked in DRG neurons from both control and diabetic rats by capsazepine. The difference in the reduced pH-activated currents in the presence of capsazepine was not significantly different between control and diabetic rats (p > 0.1), suggesting the proton-gating property of VR1 is not changed in DRG neurons in diabetic rats. Increased Oligomeric Structure and Phosphorylation of VR1 Receptor in DRGs from Diabetic Rats—To test whether the increased function of the VR1 receptor was because of increased protein expression, we extracted crude DRG homogenates and plasma membranes, and we analyzed VR1 expression level by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 3A, the expression level of VR1 was substantially decreased in diabetic rats (55 ± 10% of the control; n = 8, p < 0.05), when total protein from DRGs (including both cytoplasm and membrane protein) was analyzed using crude homogenates. When plasma membrane extracts were subjected to analysis, the level of VR1 expression was significantly increased in DRGs of diabetic rats (151 ± 6% of the control levels; n = 5, p < 0.05), indicating that more VR1 receptor was aggregated in cell membranes of diabetic DRG neurons as compared with the control. These results support a redistribution of VR1 protein from cytoplasm to cell surface membranes in diabetic rats, whereas total VR1 expression is down-regulated. Previous studies indicate that VR1 receptors exhibit oligomeric forms as native structure in transfected COS-7 cells and rat DRGs (27Kedei N. Szabo T. Lile J.D. Treanor J.J. Olah Z. Iadarola M.J. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28613-28619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). To evaluate possible structural changes in VR1 receptors in diabetic rats, we examined the VR1 protein complex by PFO-PAGE. In gel electrophoresis, NaPFO was used to replace SDS as it is less disruptive of interactions within protein oligomers and thus permits molecular mass determination of multimeric proteins (27Kedei N. Szabo T. Lile J.D. Treanor J.J. Olah Z. Iadarola M.J. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28613-28619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 32Ramjeesingh M.

When crude DRG homogenates prepared with 3% NaPFO were subjected to PFO-PAGE, a high molecular weight band (∼370 kDa) was detected by anti-VR1 antibody on 6% Tris-HCl gels as well as a lower molecular weight band (∼95 kDa) (Fig. 3B). Based on the obtained molecular weights, these two bands represented VR1 tetramer and monomer, respectively (27Kedei N. Szabo T. Lile J.D. Treanor J.J. Olah Z. Iadarola M.J. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2019083809,"Contrary to the conventional wisdom that there is only one unique liquid state for any material, recent evidence suggests that there can be more than two liquid states even for a single-component substance. The transition between these liquid states is called a liquid-liquid phase transition. We report the detailed experimental investigation on the kinetics of the continuous spinodal-decomposition-type transformation of one liquid into another for triphenyl phosphite. From the analysis of the linear regime, we found that the correlation length, ξ, of fluctuations of the relevant order parameter diverges as ξ = ξ 0 [( T SD – T )/ T SD ] –ν (where ξ 0 = 60 nm and ν = 0.5) while approaching the spinodal temperature, T SD . This is an indication of a critical-like anomaly associated with the liquid-liquid transition. We also revealed that the order parameter governing the liquid-liquid transition must be of a nonconserved nature."
https://openalex.org/W2095927366,"Protein aggregation is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and hence is considered an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. However, protein-protein interactions are exceedingly difficult to inhibit. Small molecules lack sufficient steric bulk to prevent interactions between large peptide surfaces. To yield potent inhibitors of β-amyloid (Aβ) aggregation, we synthesized small molecules that increase their steric bulk by binding to chaperones but also have a moiety available for interaction with Aβ. This strategy yields potent inhibitors of Aβ aggregation and could lead to therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease and other forms of neurodegeneration."

Four paralogous plasmepsins reside in the food vacuole of P. falciparum. Targeted gene disruption by double crossover homologous recombination has been employed to study food vacuole plasmepsin function in cultured parasites. Parasite clones with deletions in each of the individual PM I, PM II, and HAP genes as well as clones with a double PM IV/PM I disruption have been generated. All of these clones lack the corresponding PMs, are viable, and appear morphologically normal. PM II and PM IV/I disruptions have longer doubling times than the 3D7 parental line in rich RPMI medium. This appears to be because of a decreased level of productive progeny rather than an increased cell cycle time. In amino acid-limited medium, all four knockouts exhibit slower growth than the parental strain. Compared with 3D7, knock-out clone sensitivity to aspartic and cysteine protease inhibitors is changed minimally. These results suggest substantial functional redundancy and have important implications for the design of antimalarial drugs.

Malaria kills 1–2 million people every year, most of whom are children under the age of 5. The economic burden caused by malaria in endemic countries is large, estimated to be approximately 1–2% of the gross domestic product in these countries (1World Health Organization (2004) WHO Fact Sheet No. 94—Malaria, GenevaGoogle Scholar). Nearly all malarial deaths are caused by Plasmodium falciparum, a protozoan parasite that lives in human red blood cells during its asexual life cycle. Drug resistance in P. falciparum is an enormous problem and new antimalarial agents are needed desperately. In the effort to develop new treatments for malaria, the study of hemoglobin degradation in the food vacuole of the parasite has generated substantial interest because it is a major metabolic pathway of the parasite and is believed to be essential for the survival of the parasite (2Banerjee R. Goldberg D.E. Rosenthal P.J. Antimalarial Chemotherapy: Mechanisms of Action, Resistance, and New Directions. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 43-63Google Scholar).A family of P. falciparum aspartic proteases called plasmepsins has been found to be important for the initiation of hemoglobin degradation in vitro and in vivo (3Bray P.G.

However, the in vivo potency of generated compounds has been limited. The malaria genome project has revealed that there are 10 plasmepsins in the P. falciparum genome (10Coombs G.H. Goldberg D.E. Klemba M. Berry C. Kay J. Mottram J.C. Trends Parasitol. 2001; 17: 532-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Four of them, PM I and II, histoaspartic protease (HAP, known previously as PM III), and PM IV, reside in the food vacuole and can degrade hemoglobin or globin (4Banerjee R. Liu J. Beatty W. Pelosof L. Klemba M. Goldberg D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 990-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The four plasmepsins are highly homologous to each other, sharing more than 60% amino acid identity. HAP is unique in that it has a histidine in place of the first canonical aspartic acid but is an active protease that may function by an aspartic or serine protease mechanism (4Banerjee R. Liu J.

Because of the high degree of similarity, the specific roles of the food vacuole plasmepsins in vivo has been unclear, and which of these genes (if any) is essential to the parasite has been unknown.To address this question and to determine whether a particular plasmepsin should be considered as the primary drug target, we systematically disrupted all four plasmepsin genes. Our results suggest that the four plasmepsins have overlapping roles in the hemoglobin degradation pathway and that there is a selective advantage for P. falciparum to keep the multiple food vacuole plasmepsin genes in its genome.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESParasite Culture, Transfection, and Selection—Asexual stage P. falciparum clone 3D7 was cultured in human O+ erythrocytes at 2% hematocrit under 5% CO2, 5% O2, and 90% N2 (12Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6077) Google Scholar). Except as stated, cultures were grown in rich medium (RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 27 mm NaHCO3,11mm glucose, 0.37 mm hypoxanthine, 10 μg/ml gentamicin, and 5 g/liter Albumax (Invitrogen)). Serum medium (Albumax replaced by 10% heat-inactivated human O- serum (Interstate Blood Bank Inc., Memphis, TN)) was used for cultures being electroporated or under drug selection. For some experiments, an amino acid-limited medium was used, which was made by omitting all but five essential amino acids, cysteine, glutamic acid, glutamine, isoleucine, and methionine, from rich medium (13Francis S.E.

Parasite synchronization was performed by 5% d-sorbitol treatment (14Lambros C. Vanderberg J.P. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2792) Google Scholar). Ring stage parasites at 5–8% parasitemia were transfected by electroporation with 100 μg of supercoiled transfection vectors (see below) using low voltage, high capacitance conditions (15Fidock D.A. Wellems T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10931-10936Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Following transfection, parasites were maintained in drug-free medium for 48 h at which time positive selection was initiated by the addition of 10 nm WR99210 (Jacobus Pharmaceuticals, Princeton, NJ) to the medium. Drug-resistant parasites appeared in 3–6 weeks. When parasites reached a parasitemia of ∼ 2%, 4 or 10 μm ganciclovir (Roche Applied Science) was added to start negative selection. After 2–8 weeks, parasites appeared. The WR99210/ganciclovir doubly resistant parasites were cloned by limiting dilution, and their genotypes were analyzed by Southern blotting and PCR.Construction of Transfection Vectors—The parental plasmid pHHT-TK was obtained from Dr. Alan Cowman (16Duraisingh M.T.

Genomic DNA was extracted from parasite-infected red blood cells using QIAamp DNA blood mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia CA). For each clone, 1.5 μg of DNA was digested using the following restriction enzymes: ScaI for the PM I KO1 clones A9 and E9, StuI for the PM II KO2 clones C5 and D2, SpeI-MspI for the HAP KO3 clones G2 and G9, and PacI for the PM IV/I KO4/1 clones A5 and E5. 3D7 DNA was used as a control for each digestion. The digested DNA was resolved on an 0.7% agarose gel for KO1, KO2, and KO3 clones and on an 0.8% agarose gel for KO4/1 clones. Gels were blotted onto Nytran SuPer-Charge membrane (Schleicher & Schüll), and a signal was generated using an AlkPhos direct labeling and detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) with the manufacturer's recommended hybridization and washing conditions. All blots were hybridized against human dihydrofolate reductase using a probe made by the digestion of pHHT-TK with HindIII-BamHI. After stripping with 0.5% SDS, the blots were reprobed with gene-specific probes (PM I-5′ for KO1, PM II-3′ for KO2, and HAP-5′ for KO3). In the case of KO4/1, an identically loaded blot was probed with PM IV-5′.Antibodies and Western Blotting—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies 574 (anti-PM I) and 737 (anti-PM II) were described previously (17Francis S.E.

For immunoblotting, parasites were separated from the erythrocyte cytosol by treatment with ice-cold 0.1% saponin in PBS for 10 min on ice followed by a cold PBS wash. Parasite pellets were stored at -80 °C until use. Parasites were lysed by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer. The lysates were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a Protran nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schüll). Primary antibodies used were: 574 (1:1000) for KO1, 737 (1:5000) for KO2, 3F10-6 (1:5000) for KO3, and 1C6-24 (1:2000) and 13.9.2 (1:1000) for KO4/1. All blots were reprobed using anti-BiP to assess loading. The signal was developed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1: 3000) or anti-mouse IgG (1:3000) secondary antibodies and ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences).Flow Cytometry—The flow cytometry protocol was adapted from Barkan et al. (21Barkan D. Ginsburg H. Golenser J. Int. J. Parasitol. 2000; 30: 649-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In brief, parasite cultures were fixed in 0.05% glutaraldehyde in PBS and stored at 4 °C. The cells were permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature and stained with 5 μg/ml propidium iodide (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The cells were then diluted 10-fold in PBS and analyzed using an Epics XL-MCL flow cytometer (Beckman). 1 × 105 erythrocytes were counted in triplicate for each sample. Data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Treestar Inc., Ashland, OR).Parasite Growth Rate Analysis—Asynchronous cultures were maintained at parasitemias between 0.5 and 4% by daily passage. Samples were taken approximately every 24 h over a period of 7 days, and parasitemia was measured by flow cytometry. The total number of parasites, y (parasitemia × dilution factor), was graphed against time (x) and fitted to the exponential growth curve using KaleidaGraph software (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). y=m0⋅e(ln2⋅x/τ) Here, τ is the intrinsic parasite doubling time, and m0 is the theoretical parasite number at time 0. To compare directly the growth rate of cultures with slightly different starting parasitemias, the -fold increase of the parasite number, normalized to have a single theoretical parasite for each culture at time 0, was graphed and is shown in Figs. 3 and 5.Fig. 5Growth rate of knock-out clones in amino acid-limited medium. Asynchronous cultures were grown in amino acid-limited medium and sampled daily. Parasitemias were quantified by flow cytometry and plotted against time for KO1 clones A9 and E9 (A), KO2 clones C5 and D2 (B), KO3 clones G2 and G9 (C), and KO4/1 clones A5 and E5 (D). Symbols and curves are as in Fig. 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Parasite Life Cycle Analysis—Synchronous cultures of each clone with parasitemias between 1 and 2% were prepared by sorbitol treatment and dispensed in triplicate into 96-well microtiter plates in 100-μl aliquots. Every 2 h, a plate was removed from the incubator, and parasites were fixed by the addition of 100 μl of 0.1% glutaraldehyde. The distribution of stages and parasitemia of each sample were analyzed by flow cytometry. The high fluorescence region that corresponds to schizont stage parasites was gated, and the percent of parasites in this region was plotted against time. The points were fitted to an exponential sine wave function using KaleidaGraph software (Synergy Software). y=m1+m2⋅e[m3+m4⋅sin(2πx/tr+m5)] Here, y is the percentage of schizonts in the culture, x is the independent variable (time), tr is the period of the function in radians, which is converted to degrees by the formula td = (180/π) · tr, and m1–m5 are curve-fitting parameters, which are not related to the period of the function. In all cases, the R values of the curve fitting were greater than 0.99.Determination of EC50 Values for Pepstatin A and E64 —Inhibitor EC50 values were determined essentially as described previously (13Francis S.E. Gluzman I.Y. Oksman A. Knickerbocker A. Mueller R. Bryant M.L. Sherman D.R. Russell D.G. Goldberg D.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 306-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). 200-μl aliquots of late ring stage cultures at ∼0.5% parasitemia were incubated with various concentrations of either pepstatin A (Roche Applied Science) or trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamino(4-guanidine)-butane (E64) in hypoxanthine-free rich medium for 42 h. 0.5 μCi of [3H]hypoxanthine (178.7 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer) was added to the culture, and the incubation continued for 24 h. Cultures were harvested on glass fiber paper, immersed in UltimaGold scintillation counting mixture (PerkinElmer), and counted in a scintillation counter. The percentage of the inhibition of [3H]hypoxanthine uptake was plotted against the drug concentration, and the curve was fitted using the modified dose-response logistic equation in KaleidaGraph software.Statistical Analysis—One-tailed t tests were employed to analyze the significance of the doubling times and cell cycle times of the knockouts as compared with 3D7.

To disrupt the plasmepsin genes, a positive/negative selection strategy was employed (16Duraisingh M.T. Triglia T. Cowman A.F. Int. J. Parasitol. 2002; 32: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Approximately 500–650 bp of homologous sequence from the 5′ and 3′ ends of each gene was amplified from 3D7 genomic DNA and cloned into plasmid pHHT-TK at sites flanking the positive selectable marker human dihydrofolate reductase (which confers resistance to the antifolate WR99210). The sequences were chosen so that those regions of each plasmepsin gene that were necessary for the formation of the active site would be deleted on double crossover recombination. Following transfection, parasites were first selected with 10 nm WR99210 and then with 4 or 10 μm ganciclovir to obtain parasites that had undergone double crossover recombination (16Duraisingh M.T. Triglia T. Cowman A.F. Int. J. Parasitol. 2002; 32: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).Fig. 1Targeted gene disruption of plasmepsin I, II, IV and HAP.A, schematic diagram is shown of plasmepsin I, II, IV, and HAP gene loci. The four genes cluster in tandem on chromosome 14 in the order shown. Each gene is approximately 1.4 kb, and the distances between neighboring genes are indicated (the diagram is not drawn to scale). B–E, confirmation of gene disruptions by Southern blotting is shown. Restriction enzymes used are diagramed (not to scale). Dashed lines correspond to the targeted DNA fragments before and after integration. DNA for each of two clones of KO1 (B), KO2 (C), KO3 (D), and KO4/1 (E) was analyzed. 3D7 DNA was used as control (left lanes), and probes used are denoted under each blot. Arrowheads mark the migration positions of the digested targeting plasmid. hDHFR, human dihydrofolate reductase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We were able to recover parasites with individual disruptions of PM I and II and HAP. This was confirmed by Southern blotting (Fig. 1, B–D) and by PCR (data not shown). Two clones from each targeting experiment were analyzed. Using probes corresponding to the targeted region, there was a 2.2-kb increase in migration of the restriction fragment compared with parental 3D7 DNA, as predicted (Fig. 1, B–D, left panels). When the human dihydrofolate reductase gene was used as the probe, no signal was detected in the 3D7 lanes, and bands of the sizes predicted for recombination were detected for the knockout clones (Fig. 1, B–D, right panels). We were not able to recover PM IV-disrupted parasites despite multiple attempts with several different targeting constructs. As an alternative strategy, we designed a double knock-out vector with targeting sequences homologous to the PM IV-5′ end and the PM I-3′ end (no gene is predicted for the PM IV/I intergenic region). Following transfection and selection of this construct, parasites with disruption of both PM IV and PM I were obtained successfully (Fig. 1E). The PM IV-5′ probe detected the predicted 2.1-kb band in the 3D7 lane and the 9.0-kb band in the KO4/1 lanes. Hybridization to human dihydrofolate reductase also detected a band of the same size in the KO4/1 lanes.We further confirmed the disruption of each gene by Western blotting using specific anti-PM antibodies (Fig. 2). Parasites were lysed, and equal amounts of protein were loaded in each lane for each experiment. As a loading control, blots were stripped and reprobed for BiP, an ER resident protein (Fig. 2, bottom rows). In agreement with the DNA analysis, no targeted protein bands were detected in the clone of either KO1, KO2, KO3, or KO4/1 (Fig. 2). All antibodies detected the corresponding plasmepsin band in the 3D7 lane on the same blot. No significant induction of untargeted plasmepsins or of falcipain-2 was seen for any of the knockouts, as judged by Western blotting with heterologous plasmepsin and falcipain-2 antibodies (data not shown).Fig. 2Western blotting analysis of knock-out clones. Total parasite lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-PM I antibody 574 (A), anti-PM II antibody 737 (B), anti-HAP antibody 3F10–6 (C), and anti-PM I antibody 1C6–24 and anti-PM IV antibody 13.9.2 (D). Blots were reprobed with anti-BiP antibody as a loading control (lower panels). The lower band in B was seen with secondary antibody alone (34Klemba M. Beatty W. Gluzman I. Goldberg D.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Parasite Growth Analysis—Giemsa-stained knock-out clones appeared morphologically normal. To compare parental and knock-out growth rates, we monitored parasite proliferation by flow cytometry. Two clones from each knock-out line and two independently maintained 3D7 cultures were grown asynchronously in rich medium and sampled approximately every 24 h for 1 week. The samples were fixed and stained with the DNA dye propidium iodide, and parasitemia was counted by flow cytometry. After 7 days, the -fold increase of both KO2 clones was approximately 80% of 3D7 (Fig. 3B) and approximately 60% of 3D7 for the KO4/1 clones (Fig. 3D). The growth of the KO1 and KO3 clones relative to 3D7 was not significantly different (Fig. 3, A and C). We fitted these data to an exponential growth curve and calculated doubling times (see “Experimental Procedures”). Compared with 3D7, the KO2 doubling time was 5% longer, and KO4/1 doubling time was 9% longer (Table II).To test the possibility that the slow growth of KO2 and KO4/1 was caused by an extended cell cycle, we monitored the growth of synchronous parasites for 56 h, with frequent sampling (total of 26 samplings taken at ∼2-h intervals). Cultures were analyzed by flow cytometry, and the percentage of parasites at the schizont stage (post-S phase) was plotted against time (Fig. 4). As expected, the curves were periodic and fitted an exponential sine wave function (R > 0.99, see “Experimental Procedures”). A one-tailed Student's t test of the cell cycle times indicated that there was no significant difference between 3D7 and any of the knockouts (Table II). Similar results were obtained by plotting either the percentage of ring or percentage of trophozoite forms from this same experiment (data not shown).Fig. 4Cell cycle time of knock-out clones. Synchronous cultures were grown in rich medium for 56 h and sampled every 2 to 3 h. The parasite stage was analyzed by flow cytometry, and the percentage of parasites at the schizont stage was plotted against time. Two independently maintained 3D7 cultures (open and filled circles, respectively) and the two clones for each knockout, KO1, A9 and E9 (open and filled green triangles), KO2, C5 and D2 (open and filled blue squares), KO3, G2 and G9 (open and filled yellow inverted triangles), and KO4/1, A5 and E5 (open and filled red diamonds), were analyzed. Error bars indicate the standard deviation of triplicate samples. The data were fitted to an exponential sine wave equation, and the curves are shown. Dotted lines correspond to open symbols, and solid lines correspond to closed symbols.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Parasite Growth in Amino Acid-limited Medium—An amino acid-limited medium was used to test parasite growth. This medium contains the five amino acids that are lacking or limited in hemoglobin and forces the parasite to rely on hemoglobin degradation to obtain amino acids to sustain its growth (13Francis S.E. Gluzman I.Y. Oksman A. Knickerbocker A. Mueller R. Bryant M.L. Sherman D.R. Russell D.G. Goldberg D.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 306-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). A growth rate analysis similar to that in rich medium was performed. All cultures grew more slowly in amino acid-limited medium, with ∼5% of the overall growth in rich medium after 7 days (Fig. 5). The slow growth phenotype of the KO4/1 clones was the most obvious at approximately 60% of the 3D7 level in 1 week, and the growth of KO1, KO2, and KO3 clones was 70–80% of the 3D7 level. The doubling times were calculated and are listed in Table II. Doubling times for KO1, KO2, and KO3 clones were 4–5% longer than for 3D7, whereas those for KO4/1 clones were 13% longer, all of which represent significant differences.Sensitivities to Pepstatin A and E64 —Because both aspartic and cysteine protease activities participate in hemoglobin degradation in the food vacuole, we were interested to see if the susceptibility of knockouts to aspartic and cysteine protease inhibitors would change. The EC50 values of pepstatin A and E64 for each clone were determined and are reported as the percentage of inhibition relative to 3D7 (Fig. 6). All knock-out clones were slightly less sensitive (increased EC50) to pepstatin A, although they were slightly more sensitive to E64, except the KO3 clones that remained unchange"
https://openalex.org/W1994821070,"Excess cyclin E-Cdk2 accelerates entry into S phase of the cell cycle and promotes polyploidy, which may contribute to genomic instability in cancer cells. We identified 20 amino acids in cyclin E as a centrosomal localization signal (CLS) essential for both centrosomal targeting and promoting DNA synthesis. Expressed wild-type, but not mutant, CLS peptides localized on the centrosome, prevented endogenous cyclin E and cyclin A from localizing to the centrosome, and inhibited DNA synthesis. Ectopic cyclin E localized to the centrosome and accelerated S phase entry even with mutations that abolish Cdk2 binding, but not with a mutation in the CLS. These results suggest that cyclin E has a modular centrosomal-targeting domain essential for promoting S phase entry in a Cdk2-independent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2063516501,"Eukaryotic chromatin is highly dynamic and turns over rapidly even in the absence of DNA replication. Here we show that the acidic histone chaperone nucleosome assembly protein 1 (NAP-1) from yeast reversibly removes and replaces histone protein dimer H2A-H2B or histone variant dimers from assembled nucleosomes, resulting in active histone exchange. Transient removal of H2A-H2B dimers facilitates nucleosome sliding along the DNA to a thermodynamically favorable position. Histone exchange as well as nucleosome sliding is independent of ATP and relies on the presence of the C-terminal acidic domain of yeast NAP-1, even though this region is not required for histone binding and chromatin assembly. Our results suggest a novel role for NAP-1 (and perhaps other acidic histone chaperones) in mediating chromatin fluidity by incorporating histone variants and assisting nucleosome sliding.

NAP-1 may function either untargeted (if acting alone) or may be targeted to specific regions within the genome through interactions with additional factors. The organization of DNA into chromatin has profound consequences for all processes that involve the DNA template, and the biochemical makeup of the nucleosome has important regulatory functions. The nucleosome consists of an octamer of two copies each of the four histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, around which 147 bp of DNA are wrapped in 1.65 superhelical turns (1Luger K. Maeder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (6884) Google Scholar). A (H3-H4)2 tetramer organizes the central ∼70 bp of DNA and is flanked on either side by one H2A-H2B dimer that each organizes about 40 bp of DNA. Structural and functional variability is introduced by highly regulated reversible post-translational modifications of individual histones and by the introduction of histone variants, in particular H2A and H3 variants, at specific regions in the genome (for review, see Refs. 2Khorasanizadeh S. Cell. 2004; 116: 259-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar and 3Malik H.S. Henikoff S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 882-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Despite the high degree of DNA compaction, chromatin is surprisingly dynamic and fluidic, and its histone components are exchanged at a high rate in the absence of transcription and replication. Histone H2A-H2B dimers (and, to a certain extent, also (H3-H4)2 tetramers) appear to be in rapid exchange in most regions of compacted chromatin (4Jackson V. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 719-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 5Kimura H. Cook P.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1341-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), and histone variants are incorporated in replication-independent assembly pathways (e.g. Ref. 6Ahmad K. Henikoff S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1191-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors, in collaboration with histone modifying activities, further enhance chromatin fluidity (7Flaus A. Owen-Hughes T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 8Becker P.B. Horz W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 247-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 9Geiman T.M. Robertson K.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 87: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), with pronounced effects on gene expression patterns. The transient removal of one or both H2A-H2B dimers from a nucleosome is involved in many vital cellular processes. For example, it has been known for more than 20 years that transcriptionally active chromatin is depleted in H2A and H2B (10Baer B.W. Rhodes D. Nature. 1983; 301: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The FACT complex is likely to be at least in part responsible (11Belotserkovskaya R. Oh S. Bondarenko V.A. Orphanides G. Studitsky V.M. Reinberg D. Science. 2003; 301: 1090-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), but a possible role for the histone chaperone NAP-1 1The abbreviations used are: NAP-1, nucleosome assembly protein 1; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CPM, 7-diethylamino-3-(4′-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin; yNAP-1, yeast NAP-1; NCP, nucleosome core particle; MNase, micrococcal nuclease. 1The abbreviations used are: NAP-1, nucleosome assembly protein 1; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CPM, 7-diethylamino-3-(4′-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin; yNAP-1, yeast NAP-1; NCP, nucleosome core particle; MNase, micrococcal nuclease. has also been described recently (12Levchenko V. Jackson V. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2359-2372Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). RNA polymerase II alone is also able to displace H2A-H2B dimers during elongation in vitro (13Kireeva M.L. Walter W. Tchernajenko V. Bondarenko V. Kashlev M. Studitsky V.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 541-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). H2A-H2B destabilization occurs as a consequence of nucleosome sliding catalyzed by several chromatin remodeling complexes (14Bruno M. Flaus A. Stockdale C. Rencurel C. Ferreira H. Owen-Hughes T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1599-1606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Finally, it was recently found that a specific ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factor, Swr1, is responsible for the replication-independent incorporation of the histone variant H2A.Z into yeast chromatin (for review, see Ref. 15Korber P. Horz W. Cell. 2004; 117: 5-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Histones are highly basic and are usually found in complex with histone chaperones when not bound to DNA (for review, see Ref. 16Loyola A. Almouzni G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1677: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). These acidic proteins (several nonrelated families exist) are quite abundant in most eukaryotic cells, but their role in nucleosome turnover has not been investigated thoroughly (for review, see Refs. 17Tyler J.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2268-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar and 18Akey C.W. Luger K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 6-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). A renewal of interest has come with the recent discovery in yeast that the acidic histone chaperone NAP-1 is found in association with an H2A.Z-H2B dimer in vivo. This NAP·Z complex is thought to supply H2A.Z-H2B dimers to the Swr1 complex (19Krogan N.J. Keogh M.C. Datta N. Sawa C. Ryan O.W. Ding H. Haw R.A. Pootoolal J. Tong A. Canadien V. Richards D.P. Wu X.

NAP-1 is an average size (∼400 amino acids) acidic protein of unknown structure with a molecular mass of ∼ 47,000 and a pI of 4.25. Approximately 21% of all amino acids are either aspartic or glutamic acid, clustered in several acidic stretches. The exact amino acid sequence of NAP-1 is only moderately conserved between different organisms (22Ito T. Bulger M. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3112-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), but their character is maintained throughout most of its length. Although its roles in histone transport and nucleosome assembly are best characterized, NAP-1 appears to have pleiotropic roles in vivo. In Drosophila, NAP-1 is a part of the multifactorial chromatin assembly machinery that mediates the ATP-facilitated assembly of regularly spaced nucleosomal arrays (22Ito T. Bulger M. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3112-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 23Ito T. Tyler J.K. Bulger M. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25041-25048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). NAP-1 and other acidic histone chaperones were also shown to cooperate with SWI/SNF complexes in chromatin remodeling and to facilitate transcription factor binding to nucleosomal DNA in vitro (24Chen H. Li B. Workman J.L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 380-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 25Cote J. Quinn J. Workman J.L. Peterson C.L.

Furthermore, direct functional and physical interactions between transcriptional activators and human NAP-1 were reported (27Asahara H. Tartare-Deckert S. Nakagawa T. Ikehara T. Hirose F. Hunter T.

Systematic deletion of the NAP-1 gene in yeast had no pronounced effect on yeast cells (30Tong A.H. Lesage G. Bader G.D. Ding H. Xu H. Xin X. Young J. Berriz G.F. Brost R.L. Chang M. Chen Y. Cheng X.

Science. 2004; 303: 808-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar), suggesting redundancy in its function. However, genomewide expression analysis of NAP-1 deletions in yeast has shown that the transcription level of ∼10% of all yeast open reading frames changed by at least 2-fold (31Ohkuni K. Shirahige K. Kikuchi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 306: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Deletion of the NAP-1 gene in flies is lethal (32Lankenau S. Barnickel T. Marhold J. Lyko F. Mechler B.M. Lankenau D.H. Genetics. 2003; 163: 611-623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analytical ultracentrifugation has shown that yeast NAP-1 (yNAP-1) exists as an obligate dimer in solution (33McBryant S.J. Peersen O.B. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10592-10599Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Functional analysis of NAP-1 in vitro is based primarily on its ability to introduce negative supercoils into relaxed circular DNA in the presence of core histones (34Fujii Nakata T. Ishimi Y. Okuda A. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20980-20986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to generate regularly spaced nucleosomes on salt-assembled chromatin (35McQuibban G.A.

Kadonaga J.T. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 371: 499-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Using deletion analysis, it was also shown that residues 65–365 of yNAP-1 were necessary and sufficient for histone binding and in vitro assembly reaction and that a long negatively charged stretch at the C terminus was dispensable for its assembly activity in vitro (34Fujii Nakata T.

The functions described above can be ascribed to the well characterized ability of NAP-1 specifically to bind and sequester histone complexes (37McBryant S.J. Park Y.J. Abernathy S.M. Laybourn P.J.

However, only a few studies address the interactions of NAP-1 or any other chaperone with nucleosomes and chromatin or its effect on chromatin structure and dynamics (12Levchenko V. Jackson V.

Here we study yNAP-1 as a model system to investigate whether and how histone chaperones contribute to dynamic histone exchange, a property that is emerging as an essential feature of eukaryotic chromatin. Using fluorescently labeled histones and nucleosomes we find that yNAP-1 (in the absence of ATP or other protein factors) is capable of removing H2A-H2B dimers from folded nucleosomes and actively exchanges histone dimers containing an H2A variant into completely assembled nucleosomes. We characterize the ability of yNAP-1 to assist nucleosome sliding on DNA and show conclusively that this activity requires the yNAP-1-dependent transient dissociation of H2A-H2B dimers from folded nucleosome core particles (NCPs). Preparation of DNA, Histones, yNAP-1, and Nucleosomes—a 146-bp DNA fragment derived from a 5 S rRNA gene (40Simpson R.T. Stafford D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) was prepared as described previously (41Dyer P.N. Edayathumangalam R.S. White C.L. Bao Y. Chakravarthy S. Muthurajan U.M. Luger K. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 375: 23-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Both ends of the DNA were labeled with 7-diethylamino-3-(4′-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin (CPM), respectively (42Park Y.J. Dyer P.N. Tremethick D.J. Luger K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24274-24282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). To prepare the fluorescently labeled histones, H2BT112C and H4T71C mutants were used (42Park Y.J. Dyer P.N. Tremethick D.J. Luger K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24274-24282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Recombinant histones and histone H2A variants (H2A.Z, macroH2A histone domain, and H2A Bbd) were refolded to histone dimer or octamers. Nucleosomes were reconstituted by dialysis against decreasing salt concentration as described previously (41Dyer P.N. Edayathumangalam R.S. White C.L. Bao Y. Chakravarthy S. Muthurajan U.M. Luger K. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 375: 23-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar) and analyzed by native PAGE on 5% polyacrylamide gels (acrylamide:bisacrylamide 59:1) in 0.2 × TBE. Full-length yNAP-1, GST-yNAP-1, and truncated versions (yNAP-1ΔN and yNAP-1ΔNC) were expressed and purified as described previously (37McBryant S.J. Park Y.J. Abernathy S.M. Laybourn P.J. Nyborg J.K. Luger K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44574-44583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain (CTD, amino acids 302–417) of yNAP-1 was purified over a nickel affinity resin. The His tag was cleaved off with thrombin, followed by purification over a Mono Q column. Detection of H2A-H2B Dimer Dissociation from the Nucleosome—Nucleosomes containing fluorescently labeled histones or DNA were prepared as described above. 3.5 μm CPM-labeled NCP was incubated with increasing molar ratios of yNAP-1 at 4 °C for 10 h in buffer A (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol). H2A-H2B dimer dissociation was analyzed by native PAGE as described above. Nucleosomal bands (N1, S1, S2, and S3) were electroeluted from gel slices into 0.05 × TBE and were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE. As controls, fluorescently labeled NCP (as indicated) was incubated with a 4–24-fold molar excess of albumin (obtained from Sigma) under the same conditions. Histone Dimer Exchange—3.5 μm unlabeled NCP was incubated with preincubated yNAP-1-histone dimer mixtures (3.5 μm H2A-H2B CPM dimer and 3.5 μm yNAP-1 dimer) at 4 °C for 10 h in buffer A. Nucleosomes containing fluorescently labeled (H2A-H2BT112C) dimer were prepared as a control. The exchange of fluorescently labeled H2A-H2B dimer or (H2A.Z-H2B) dimer was analyzed by native PAGE as described above. Exchange was quantified by ImageQuant version 5.1 (Amersham Biosciences). Gels were first photographed without staining to view fluorescence at 365 nm followed by staining with ethidium bromide and/or Coomassie Blue as indicated. Control experiments using fluorescently labeled (H3-H4)2 tetramer were performed analogously. Nucleosome Sliding Assay—Nucleosomes were assembled on a previously characterized 196-bp DNA fragment derived from the 5 S rRNA gene (40Simpson R.T. Stafford D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 43Dong F. Hansen J.C. van Holde K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5724-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Nucleosomes located at the center (N1) or edge (N2) of the 196-bp 5 S DNA fragment were fractionated by preparative gel electrophoresis with Prep Cell (Bio-Rad Laboratories) using methods described previously for 146-bp NCP (41Dyer P.N. Edayathumangalam R.S. White C.L. Bao Y. Chakravarthy S. Muthurajan U.M. Luger K. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 375: 23-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Incubation in the presence or absence of yNAP-1 was performed at 4 °C for 10 h in buffer A. 3.5 μm NCP was incubated with the indicated amounts of yNAP-1. Samples were analyzed by native PAGE. Identical amounts of N1 and N2 nucleosomes (∼6 μg of DNA) were digested with 3.0 units of micrococcal nuclease (MNase) (Worthington) at 37 °C (44Bao Y. Konesky K. Park Y.J. Rosu S. Dyer P.N. Rangasamy D. Tremethick D.J. Laybourn P.J. Luger K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3314-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To analyze histone content, nucleosomes were first fractionated on a 5% native gel in 0.2 × TBE, and the nucleosome species were electroeluted into 0.05 × TBE for 45 min at 150 W and 4 °C. The eluate was concentrated and analyzed by 18% SDS-PAGE. MvaI (MBI Fermentas), ScaI, and AatII (New England Biolabs) were used to for restriction enzyme protection assays. ∼50 μm NCP was digested with 10 units of enzyme for 4 h at 37 °C, using prescribed buffers. Samples were treated with proteinase K (Sigma) at a concentration of 50 μg/ml (50 °C, 3 h). The digested DNA products were analyzed on a 10% acrylamide gel and were viewed by staining with ethidium bromide. yNAP-1 Removes H2A-H2B Dimers from the Nucleosome Core Particle—To investigate the structural changes in NCP structure resulting from yNAP-1 action, we used native gel electrophoresis, a highly sensitive assay for nucleosome structure (41Dyer P.N. Edayathumangalam R.S. White C.L. Bao Y. Chakravarthy S. Muthurajan U.M. Luger K. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 375: 23-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar), in conjunction with fluorescence labeling (42Park Y.J. Dyer P.N. Tremethick D.J. Luger K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24274-24282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We verified that yNAP-1 binding was not compromised (at least qualitatively) by the addition of the label to H2B (Supplemental Fig. 1B) and that a yNAP-1·H2A-H2B dimer complex was formed in solution (Supplemental Fig. 1C). CPM-labeled H2BT112C was utilized in all future experiments in which fluorescently labeled H2A-H2B or H2A.Z-H2B dimers were used. The stoichiometry of the yNAP-1·H2A-H2B dimer complex has been shown to be one yNAP-1 dimer/histone fold dimer (37McBryant S.J. Park Y.J. Abernathy S.M. Laybourn P.J. Nyborg J.K. Luger K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44574-44583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Molar ratios given throughout this manuscript take into account the dimeric nature of yNAP-1 (33McBryant S.J. Peersen O.B. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10592-10599Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Upon incubation of purified NCP reconstituted with fluorescently labeled H2B with increasing amounts of yNAP-1, two new bands were detected by native PAGE, and one additional band that is also present in the control significantly increased in intensity. Only two of these bands were visible without staining (Fig. 1A, upper panel, denoted with S1 and S2), demonstrating that only they contained H2B. One additional band, apparent at higher yNAP-1:NCP ratios, is visible only after staining with ethidium bromide (not shown) and Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Fig. 1A, lower panel, S3). Even at the largest excess of yNAP-1 dimer over NCP (4-fold, lane 5), only very small amounts (<2%) of free DNA are released. The unstained gel was digitized under fluorescent light, and the relative amounts of the nucleosomal bands (N1, S1, and S2) were plotted against the ratio of yNAP-1 to NCP (Fig. 1B). This plot reveals that S1 is present in maximum amounts at a yNAP-1 dimer to NCP ratio of ∼1.5 and that S2 appears at the expense of N1 upon increasing yNAP-1:NCP ratios. S3 was too faint to be quantified. To investigate further the composition of each band, we expanded the previous experiment and prepared NCPs in which H2B, H4, or the DNA was fluorescently labeled as described earlier (42Park Y.J. Dyer P.N. Tremethick D.J. Luger K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24274-24282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The purified NCPs were incubated with a 2-fold molar excess of yNAP-1 dimer over nucleosomes (refer to lane 3 in Fig. 1A), and the products were analyzed by native PAGE (Fig. 2A). The gels were analyzed without staining to visualize only fluorescent species. Importantly, we did not observe any detectable yNAP-1·(H3-H4)2 tetramer complexes under moderate conditions (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 5); however, at a higher temperature (37 °C for 12 h) and a large (12-fold) excess of yNAP-1 over NCP, some dissociation of the (H3-H4)2 tetramer from the DNA was observed (not shown). We show conclusively that N1 and S1 contain DNA, (H3-H4)2 tetramer, and H2A-H2B dimers because both of these bands light up if nucleosomes reconstituted with fluorescently labeled DNA (lane 3), H4 (lane 5), and H2B (lane 7) are used. S1 comigrates with the off-centered NCP species that we routinely observe after salt gradient reconstitution onto this particular DNA fragment and is thus identified as a NCP with an altered translational position of the DNA with respect to the histone octamer (45Flaus A. Luger K. Tan S. Richmond T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1370-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 46Muthurajan U.M. Park Y.J. Edayathumangalam R.S. Suto R.K. Chakravarthy S. Dyer P.N. Luger K. Biopolymers. 2003; 68: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). S3 only contains (H3-H4)2 tetramer and DNA, but no H2A-H2B dimer (lanes 3 and 5) and is thus identified as a “tetrasome” (a (H3-H4)2 tetramer·DNA complex). S2 contains fluorescently labeled H2A-H2B dimer (lane 7) but no DNA or (H3-H4)2 tetramer and comigrates with a yNAP-1·H2A-H2B dimer complex (lane 8).Fig. 2Analysis of novel nucleosomal species. A, native PAGE. NCPs were reconstituted from DNA that had been labeled with CPM at the 5′-phosphate groups (DNA*), at H4 T71C (H4*), or at H2BT112C (H2B*) (42Park Y.J. Dyer P.N. Tremethick D.J. Luger K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24274-24282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Nucleosomes (3.5 μm) were incubated in the presence (+) or absence (–) of a 2-fold molar excess of yNAP-1. Incubation and gel electrophoresis were done as in Fig. 1A. Lane 1, CPM-labeled DNA; lanes 2 and 3, DNA-labeled NCP in the absence and presence of yNAP-1; lanes 4 and 5, H4-labeled NCP in the absence and presence of yNAP-1; lanes 6 and 7, H2B-labeled NCP in the absence and presence of yNAP-1; lane 8, CPM-labeled H2A-H2B dimer with yNAP-1. B, analysis of yNAP-1·H2A-H2B complex (S2) was carried out by electromobility shift assay. Fluorescently labeled NCPs were incubated without yNAP-1 (lanes 1 and 4), with yNAP-1 (lanes 2 and 5), or with GST-yNAP-1 (lanes 3 and 6). GST-yNAP-1·H2A-H2B dimer complex (GST-S2) is indicated. C, analysis of the protein composition of yNAP-1-generated nucleosome species by 15% SDS-PAGE. Lanes 1-5, N1, S1, S3, GST-S2 (lower band) and 2GST-S2 (upper band).

D, the observed effect is specific for yNAP-1. NCP (3.5 μm) containing fluorescently labeled H2A-H2B dimer or fluorescently labeled DNA was incubated with a 2-fold molar excess of yNAP-1 or a 4-fold molar excess of albumin at 4 °C for 10 h. Lane 1, fluorescently labeled DNA; lane 2, fluorescently labeled (H2A-H2B) dimer with yNAP-1 complex; lanes 3 and 6, fluorescently labeled NCP without yNAP-1 or albumin; lanes 4 and 5, and 7 and 8, fluorescently labeled NCP was incubated with yNAP-1 or albumin as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm that S2 contains yNAP-1, we performed a similar experiment with GST-tagged yNAP-1 and visualized its electrophoretic migration by fluorescence. GST-yNAP-1 is just as efficient in converting N1 to S1 and S3, but only S2 is supershifted (Fig. 2B, lane 6). Consistent with the propensity of GST to dimerize, we observe an additional higher band on our native gels (denoted with 2GST-S2). Our experiments show no evidence of a stable yNAP-1·NCP complex because the electrophoretic migration of N1 and S1 remains unchanged (Fig. 2B). We next excised N1, S1, and S3 from a native gel and analyzed the protein content of these bands by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2C). Consistent with our interpretation of the results shown above, we found that N1 and S1 contain stoichiometric amounts of the four histones. S3 contained only histone H3 and H4, confirming that at higher yNAP-1:NCP ratios, yNAP-1 removes both H2A-H2B dimers from a folded NCP. Identical results were obtained using a GST fusion of yNAP-1 (not shown). Using GST-yNAP-1, we could also verify that S2 contained only H2A, H2B, and GST-yNAP-1 (Fig. 2C). Because yNAP-1 is highly acidic, it is formally possible that the observed removal of H2A-H2B dimers from the NCP is a “salt effect” because of competition between yNAP-1 and DNA and for the histones. To evaluate the specificity of yNAP-1 in H2A-H2B dimer dissociation, we compared the ability of yNAP-1 and albumin to alter the NCP structurally, using gel shift assays. Albumin is a protein of similar size and acidic pI. Unlike yNAP-1, a 4-fold molar excess of albumin had no effect on the nucleosomal band (Fig. 2D, compare lane 4 with 5, and 7 with 8). No H2A-H2B dimer dissociation or disruption of the NCP was observed upon addition of an up to 24-fold molar excess of albumin (data not shown). The Acidic CTD of yNAP-1 Is Necessary for the Dissociation of the H2A-H2B Dimer from the NCP, although It Is Not Required for Histone Binding—We and others have shown previously that the N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–73) and the acidic CTD (amino acids 366–417) of yNAP-1 are not required for histone binding and nucleosome assembly (34Fujii Nakata T. Ishimi Y. Okuda A. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20980-20986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37McBryant S.J. Park Y.J. Abernathy S.M. Laybourn P.J. Nyborg J.K. Luger K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44574-44583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To test whether these regions of yNAP-1 are required for the interactions with the nucleosome, we analyzed the ability of truncated yNAP-1 constructs (lacking 73 amino acids from the N terminus (yNAP-1ΔN) or the 73 N-terminal and 52 C-terminal amino acids (NAP-1ΔNC)) to remove H2A-H2B dimers from the folded NCP (Fig. 3). NAP-1ΔN retained the ability to dissociate H2A-H2B dimers from the NCP. In striking contrast, NAP-1ΔNC has completely lost the ability to alter the NCP structurally. This was shown conclusively using native PAGE of two different fluorescently labeled NCPs (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–4 and 5–8). Importantly, the CTD alone (yNAP-1 amino acids 302–417; pI 3.66) has"

When the low-pressure fluid was compressed, dark and round objects appeared in the radiograph. X-ray diffraction measurements confirmed that these objects were the highpressure liquid. The drops grew and eventually filled the sample space. Decompressing caused the reverse process. The macroscopic phase separation supported the existence of a first-order phase transition between two stable disordered phases besides the liquid-gas transition. X-ray absorption measurements revealed that the change in density at the transition corresponds to about 40% of the density of the high-pressure liquid."
https://openalex.org/W2081350198,"Thiamine diphosphate (ThDP) is used as a cofactor in many key metabolic enzymes. We present evidence that the ThDPs in the two active sites of the E1 (EC 1.2.4.1) component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex communicate over a distance of 20 angstroms by reversibly shuttling a proton through an acidic tunnel in the protein. This “proton wire” permits the co-factors to serve reciprocally as general acid/base in catalysis and to switch the conformation of crucial active-site peptide loops. This synchronizes the progression of chemical events and can account for the oligomeric organization, conformational asymmetry, and “ping-pong” kinetic properties of E1 and other thiamine-dependent enzymes."

Mitochondria relocate along microtubules (MT), but it is not clear whether MT have direct effects on mitochondrial function. Using two-photon microscopy and the mitochondrial fluorescent dyes rhodamine 123 and Rhod-2, we showed that Taxol and nocodazole, which correspondingly stabilize and disrupt MT, decreased potential and Ca2+ in the mitochondria of brain stem pre-Bötzinger complex neurons. Without changing basal cytoplasmic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), Taxol promoted the generation of [Ca2+]i spikes in dendrites. These spikes were abolished after blockade of Ca2+ influx and after depletion of internal Ca2+ stores, indicating the involvement of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release. Nocodazole decreased mitochondrial potential and [Ca2+]m and produced a long lasting increase in [Ca2+]i. MT-acting drugs depolarized single immobilized mitochondria and released previously stored Ca2+. All of these effects were inhibited by pretreatment with blockers of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), cyclosporin A, and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate. Induction of mPTP by Taxol and nocodazole was confirmed by using a calcein/Co2+ imaging technique. Electron and optical microscopy revealed tubulin bound to mitochondria. Mitochondria, MT, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) showed strong co-localization, the degree of which decreased after MT were disrupted. We propose that changes in the structure of MT by Taxol and nocodazole promote the induction of mPTP.

MT can associate with the organelles either dynamically or in a stable fashion.

Taxol (paclitaxel) and nocodazole, which correspondingly stabilize and disrupt MT, change the structure of the cytoskeleton. In proliferating cells, these drugs prevent normal mitotic spindle formation and cause the cells to halt mitosis and to initiate apoptosis. In comparison with MT-disrupting drugs, Taxol is less toxic and has recently been promoted for the treatment of ovarian, breast, lung, and prostate cancers (10Antman K. Lagakos S. Drazen J. New Engl.

We show here that Taxol and nocodazole depolarized mitochondria and released previously stored Ca2+ in brain stem pre-Bötzinger complex neurons. Both effects were inhibited by cyclosporin A (CsA) and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (APB), commonly used blockers of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). mPTP opening was validated by using the mPTP-specific calcein/Co2+ imaging technique (16Petronilli V.

Martinou J.C. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 369-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1702) Google Scholar). Electron and optical microscopy revealed close interactions of MT with mitochondria in living neurons and isolated mitochondria. We therefore suggest that mPTP induction is triggered by modification of MT interactions with proteins of the outer mitochondrial membrane, e.g. the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) (9Carre M.

Opin. Biotechnol. 2003; 14: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In non-neuronal cells mitochondria and ER are closely opposed, and mitochondria can capture Ca2+ released from the ER (21Hajnoczky G. Csordas G. Yi M. Cell Calcium. 2002; 32: 363-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 24Rizzuto R. Bernardi P. Pozzan T. J. Physiol. 2000; 529: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). In neurons, the positions of mitochondria and ER also showed a strong overlap, which disappeared after disruption of MT. Therefore we suggest that a close positioning of mitochondria and ER allows Ca2+ released via mPTP to activate a Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) from the ER but that this pathway is activated only when MT are intact and keep the two organelles in contact. Cell Isolation and Culture—The use and care of animals in this study complied with the guidelines of the European Commission (No. L358, ISSN 0378-6978) and the Committee for Animal Research, Göttingen University. The procedures for isolation of the respiratory center have been described in full previously (25Mironov S.L. Langohr K Haller M D Richter W. J. Physiol. 1998; 512: 75-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and are mentioned briefly below. Neonatal NMRI mice (P3-7) of both sexes were anesthetized with ether and decapitated at the C3-C4 spinal level. The preparation was made in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing (in mm): 136 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1.25 CaCl2, 0.8 MgSO4, 0.4 NaH2PO4, 0.3 K2HPO4, 3.3 NaHCO3, 6 glucose, pH 7.4, after equilibration with 95% O2, 5% CO2. Artificial cerebrospinal fluid was also used as a bathing medium in all experiments. After isolating the brain stem, a 1.2-1.5-mm slice was cut, and patches containing the two symmetrically placed pre-Bötzinger complexes (26Richter D.W. Spyer K.M. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 464-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) were isolated by sucking the tissue into a large bore pipette. The pieces of tissue were subsequently incubated in 50 μl of Ca2+/Mg2+-free medium (containing 0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mm EDTA) at 37 °C for 10 min. The enzymatic reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing additionally 15% horse serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 10 μg/ml (10 units/ml) penicillin/streptomycin, 1 mm Na+-pyruvate. The cell suspension, obtained by gentle pipetting, was placed onto coverslips coated with poly-d-lysine. After the cells were allowed to sediment for 30 min at 37 °C, the incubation solution was changed to 500 μl of neurobasal-A medium, also containing B27 supplement, 0.5 mml-glutamine, 10 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and growth factors neurotrophin-3 (0.5 ng/ml) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF, 0.5 ng/ml). The culture medium was exchanged on the next day after preparation and then on every fourth day. The cells were used 4-8 days after preparation. For the experiments, the coverslips were mounted onto a glass slide glued to the bottom of the perfusion camera, and the cells were examined under a microscope. experiments were performed at 34 °C. The solution exchange was achieved by switching between two reservoirs, and it took about 20 s to completely exchange the chamber contents. Cell Staining and Fluorescence Measurements—The cells were incubated at 37 °C in the dark with 2 μg/ml rhodamine 123 (Rh-123) for 25 min, with 1 μm fluo-3/AM for 20 min, 1 μm calcein/AM for 30 min (16Petronilli V. Penzo D. Scorrano L. Bernardi P. Di Lisa F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12030-12034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), or with 5 μm rhod-2/AM for 1 h. After loading, the cells were kept in a dye-free medium for at least 1 h before the experiments began. Cells were transfected with cDNA encoding enhanced yellow or cyan fluorescent tubulin or actin (Clontech, Heidelberg). 6 μl of solution containing 1 μg of cDNA and 2.7 μl of FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) was added to 97.3 μl of neurobasal-A medium without complement and thoroughly mixed with 400 μl of fresh neurobasal-A medium for 15 min. The transfection efficiency was ≤12%. The images were obtained by using either (a) a two-photon scanning microscope (performance described in full elsewhere (27Müller M. Mironov S.L. Schmidt J. Richter D.W. J. Phys. D Appl. Phys. 2003; 36: 1747-1757Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar)) or (b) a cooled charge-coupled device camera (CCD, MicroMax, Princeton Instruments) as described previously (28Mironov S.L. Richter D.W. J. Physiol. 2001; 533: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Both setups were based on the Zeiss Axioscope, and the cells were viewed under ×63 objectives (Achroplan, N.A. 0.95). Images were digitalized at 8-(a) or 12-bit (b) resolution and were collected by using custom-made (a) or MetaMorph (b) software. All experiments with one indicator dye were made by using a two-photon scanning microscope. The illumination wavelength was set to 800 nm, and the pixel acquisition time was 5-7 μs. Digital images were acquired every 5-7 s, and the average fluorescence intensity of all relevant regions was recorded and stored for a subsequent analysis. The images were analyzed by using MetaMorph software (Meta Imaging series, Universal Imaging Corp.). For simultaneous measurements of fluorescence of two indicator dyes, a monochromator light source was used (Till Photonics, Planegg, Germany). Images of wide field fluorescence were collected with exposure times ranging between 100 and 300 ms. Yellow fluorescent protein, Flutax-1, rhod-2, fluo-3, calcein, and Rh-123 were excited at 490 nm, and the fluorescence was isolated by using a dichroic mirror with mid-reflection at 505 nm and an emission filter (535 ± 15 nm). For monitoring pECFP fluorescence, the cells were excited at 435 nm by using a dichroic mirror with mid-reflection at 460 nm, and cyan fluorescence was additionally filtered by using an emission filter (475 ± 20 nm). Mitochondria and ER were co-stained with MitoGreen- and ER-Tracker, respectively, both applied at 1 μm for 30 min at 37 °C. The dyes were excited at 380 nm (ER-Tracker) and 480 nm (MitoGreen-Tracker), and the fluorescence was collected by using an emission filter (535 ± 15 nm). The degree of overlap between mitochondria and ER was calculated from the ratio of areas occupied by common pixels in the super-imposed image and that of ER. Potentiometric dyes are widely used to assess ψm changes in different preparations under various conditions (28Mironov S.L. Richter D.W. J. Physiol. 2001; 533: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 29Loew L.M. Tuft R.A. Carrington W. Fay FS.

Sci. 2004; 3: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The patterns of rhod-2 and Rh-123 fluorescence in neurons showed punctate structures representing individual mitochondria (Fig. 1). The fluorescence was measured in 2-μm-diameter regions of interest encircling the bright spots corresponding to mitochondria. The changes in the fluorescence of Rh-123 measured under different experimental conditions are in line with changes in ψm expected from known mitochondrial properties (17Duchen M.R. J. Physiol. 2000; 529: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar, 18Nicholls D.G. Budd S.L. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 315-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). The signals of 4-6 mitochondria within a cell were averaged, and the changes in fluorescence are presented as ΔF/F0 ratios (ΔF = F - F0), where F is the measured fluorescence and F0 is the initial fluorescence. Before and after each trial, the cell morphology was observed in transmitted light to ensure that experimentally induced cell death had not occurred. Each test was repeated for at least three different cell preparations, and means ± S.E. were compared by using Student's t test, with p < 0.05 being the condition for statistical significance. Analysis of variance was used for multiple comparisons. In fluo-3-loaded cells the staining was diffuse, and the signals obtained from different cell regions showed similar time dependencies. The exceptions were the local and propagating [Ca2+]i transients in dendrites initiated by Taxol (Fig. 1E). The functional viability of fluo-3-loaded neurons was routinely tested by using brief (5 s) applications of 45 mm KCl. This increased the signal of fluo-3 by about 3-fold, corresponding to the elevation of [Ca2+]i to 0.6 μm. This test was consistently used to verify that neurons are at proper resting potential and possess both functional voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels and [Ca2+]i clearance mechanisms (34Mironov S.L. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1123-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the extent of cell and hence mitochondrial loading with potentiometric probes can be affected by the activity of the plasma membrane multi-drug resistance P-glycoprotein, which is inhibited by CsA (16Petronilli V. Penzo D. Scorrano L. Bernardi P. Di Lisa F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12030-12034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Therefore in the experiments using CsA as a blocker of mPTP, the drug was added to the cells at least 1 h after the dyes were loaded. Fluorescence acquisition started 30 min after CsA addition, a protocol that excludes any effects that may be mediated by multi-drug resistance. In addition, some experiments were performed by supplementing artificial cerebrospinal fluid with 1.6 μm CsH, which inhibits the multi-drug resistance pump but not the mPTP (16Petronilli V. Penzo D. Scorrano L. Bernardi P. Di Lisa F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12030-12034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). No difference in the results was noticed. Materials—Nifedipine, CsA, Taxol (paclitaxel), APB, poly-d-lysine, l-glutamine, and horse serum were purchased from Sigma. Oligomycin, thapsigargin, and Flutax-1 were from Calbiochem. Rh-123, rhod-2/AM, fluo-3/AM, fura FF/AM, calcein/AM, and MitoGreen- and ER-Tracker were from Molecular Probes (MoBiTec, Göttingen, Germany). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Trypsin/EDTA solution, neurobasal-A medium, B27 supplement, and penicillin/streptomycin were from Invitrogen. All chemicals were reagent grade or higher. Rh-123 and oligomycin were dissolved in absolute ethanol. Other dyes and drugs were prepared as stock solutions in Me2SO. Estimation of Acting Concentration of Taxol—The concentration dependence of the effects of Taxol was quantified by using the fluorescent analog Flutax-1. Intracellular fluorescence of Flutax-1 linearly increased with the time of loading, indicating that the dye penetrates the cell membrane by means of passive diffusion. After loading of 2 μm Flutax-1 for 1 h, its distribution attained a pattern resembling the network of MT (Fig. 1C). Mean cytoplasmic signal of Flutax-1 after a 30-min loading was equal to the signal from drops containing 0.21 μm Flutax-1. Extrapolating this data to 10 μm Taxol (the concentration routinely used in experiments), we estimated that at the time when the ψm changes start to develop (Fig. 2A), the intracellular concentration of Taxol should be about 0.1 μm, which suggests that Taxol interacts with the low affinity site on MT (35Ross J.L. Fygenson D.K. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 3959-3967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Isolation of Brain Mitochondria and Immunostaining of Tubulin—Brain mitochondria were isolated from P3-P7 mice. All steps during mitochondria isolation were performed at 4 °C. Before homogenization, 40 mg of brain tissue was washed with 1 ml of extraction buffer consisting of 200 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. Brain homogenate was obtained by gentle pipetting in the extraction buffer containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and then centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting pellet was dissolved in 1 ml of extraction buffer and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min. The final pellet, representing the mitochondrial fraction, was dissolved in 0.2 ml of storage buffer consisting of 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm ATP, 0.08 mm ADP, 5 mm sodium succinate, 2 mm K2HPO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Isolated mitochondria were immobilized on glass coverslips by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 10 min and subsequently stained with Rh-123 and fura FF. Mitochondria were loaded with 1 μm Fura FF/AM for 20 min at 37 °C, and the fluorescence was recorded at excitation/emission wavelengths of 380 and 520 nm, respectively. Mitochondria were functionally active up to 10 h after isolation, and they retained both their membrane potential and Ca2+. Depolarization of mitochondria corresponded to a decrease in fluorescence of Rh-123, in line with the results obtained recently using a similar preparation (32Vergun O. Votyakova T.V. Reynolds I.J. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 3358-3366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For immunocytochemistry, the nonspecific binding sites were first blocked by incubating mitochondria for 1 h at ambient temperature in the storage buffer, and the preparation was stained with 0.03 mg/ml monoclonal anti-α-tubulin IgG fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate. After 3 h of incubation, the coverslips with immobilized mitochondria were washed twice and examined under the microscope. For electron microscopy, brain mitochondria were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 1% formaldehyde dissolved in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) for 2 h at 4 °C. After immunolabeling, ultrathin sections (40-60 nm) were cut with a Reichert Jung Ultracut E, and conventional transmission electron microscopy was performed following standard protocols (36Frambach I. Rossler W. Winkler M. Schurmann F.W. J. Comp. Neurol. 2004; 475: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—The mitochondrial protein fraction was obtained by solubilization of isolated mitochondria on ice (see above) in an equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 2% of SDS. The total protein fraction was obtained from the precipitate generated at the first round of centrifugation during a preparation of isolated mitochondria in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% SDS (pH 7.4). Tubulin, VDAC, and kinesin light chain proteins were determined by using SDS-PAGE (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207856) Google Scholar) on 10% (v/v) polyacrylamide slab gels (Roth, Germany) and transferred onto nitrocellulose paper (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). For immunoblotting, antisera and affinity-purified rabbit anti-VDAC polyclonal antibodies (Oncogene, Darmstadt, Germany), monoclonal anti-kinesin light chain antibodies (Chemicon, Hofheim, Germany), and monoclonal anti-α-tubulin antibodies (Sigma) were used. Nitrocellulose membranes containing transblotted protein bands were blocked with 5% (v/v) teleostean gelatin (Sigma) in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). Thereafter, filters were incubated for 1 h with affinity-purified antibodies at appropriate dilutions, and after washing, the membranes were incubated for 1 h with 1:3000 diluted horseradish peroxidase conjugated with either anti-mouse IgG from sheep or anti-rabbit IgG from donkey. Taxol and Nocodazole Induce mPTP—Application of Taxol (10 μm) produced immediate mitochondrial depolarization (Fig. 2A). In addition, in 6 of 12 cells examined, Taxol also induced spontaneous ψm changes. These transients propagated from dendrites toward soma and resembled the [Ca2+]i waves induced by Taxol (Fig. 1D). Pretreatment with 15 μm cyclosporin A for 30 min prior to the addition of Taxol abolished any ψm changes (Fig. 2A). This suggests that the effects of Taxol on mitochondria are caused by the opening of mPTP. In isolated brain mitochondria, Taxol depolarized mitochondria (Fig. 2C) and released previously stored Ca2+ (n = 4, data not shown). Both effects were inhibited by CsA. Given the effects of Taxol, it was interesting to examine the effects of nocodazole, which has an opposite action on MT. Nocodazole (10 μm) depolarized neuronal mitochondria, but its effects were weaker, developed more slowly, and were not fully inhibited by CsA (Fig. 2B). Isolated brain mitochondria were rapidly (within 1 min) depolarized by nocodazole; this effect was prevented by CsA (Fig. 2C), and the actions of Taxol and nocodazole were mutually exclusive. This difference in the results obtained in neuronal and isolated mitochondria was probably caused by the slow permeation of nocodazole across the plasma membrane or by other factors (38Brustovetsky N. Dubinsky J.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8229-8237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Chinopoulos C. Starkov A.A. Fiskum G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27382-27389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We therefore tested another mPTP blocker, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (39Chinopoulos C. Starkov A.A. Fiskum G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27382-27389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar)). APB completely abolished changes in ψm induced by nocodazole (Fig. 2) and Taxol (n = 3). Cytochalasin B, an actin-epolymerizing agent that modifies [Ca2+]i signaling in hippocampal cells (40Mironov S.L. Hermann A. Brain Res. 1996; 714: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), had no effect on mitochondrial variables. Induction of mPTP was next monitored by applying a calcein/Co2+ imaging technique. Taxol induced a loss of calcein from mitochondria, an effect that was prevented by pretreatment with 10 μm CsA (Fig. 3) and 100 μm APB (n = 3). The application of nocodazole produced similar effects (n = 3, data not shown). A variety of factors can promote the opening of mPTP; the most important of them are ROS (41Turrens J.F. J. Physiol. 2003; 552: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (3701) Google Scholar) and [Ca2+]m (17Duchen M.R. J. Physiol. 2000; 529: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar, 18Nicholls D.G. Budd S.L. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 315-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). In the presence of the radical scavengers l-cysteine and N,N′-diphenyl-1,4-phenylendiamine (both at 0.1 mm, n = 4), depolarization of mitochondria by Taxol was unchanged, excluding overproduction of ROS under these conditions. Taxol depolarized mitochondria in Ca2+-free solution (n = 3), which speaks against the overloading of mitochondria with Ca2+. MT-acting Drugs Change Cytosolic and Mitochondrial Ca2+—Both Taxol and nocodazole induced a slow release of mitochondrial Ca2+, which was blocked after pretreatment with CsA and APB (Fig. 4, A-C). [Ca2+]i and [Ca2+]m changes produced by nocodazole had similar kinetics (Fig. 4, B and C); the half-times for [Ca2+]i increase and [Ca2+]m decrease were 2.9 ± 0.9 and 3.1 ± 0.3 min, respectively. Notably, Taxol did not change the basal [Ca2+]i level, which also speaks against the role of mitochondrial Ca2+ overload as a possible trigger of mPTP induction. In 40% of neurons (20 of 50 examined) Taxol induced spontaneous [Ca2+]i elevations (Fig. 4, D and E), which were not observed in the presence of CsA or APB. Similar to ψm transients, [Ca2+]i spikes appeared first in dendrites and then spread out toward the soma (Fig. 1E). [Ca2+]i spikes were abolished after the blockade of Ca2+ influx with 0.1 mm Cd2+ (Fig. 4D) and Ca2+-free solution (Fig. 4E), possibly reflecting a requirement for Ca2+ influx in the activation of the CICR mechanism in neurons (42Kuba K. J. Physiol. 1980; 298: 251-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 43Mironov S.L. J. Theor. Biol. 1990; 146: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thapsigargin, a SERCA inhibitor, depleted the ER (34Mironov S.L. Neurop"
https://openalex.org/W1977149059,"Escherichia coli K1 is the most common Gram-negative organism causing meningitis, and its invasion of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) is a prerequisite for penetration into the central nervous system. We have reported previously that cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1) contributes to E. coli K1 invasion of HBMEC and interacts with 37-kDa laminin receptor precursor (37LRP) of HBMEC, which is a precursor of 67-kDa laminin receptor (67LR). In the present study, we examined the role of 67LR in the CNF1-expressing E. coli K1 invasion of HBMEC. Immunofluorescence microscopy and ligand overlay assays showed that 67LR is present on the HBMEC membrane and interacts with CNF1 protein as well as the CDPGYIGSR laminin peptide. 67LR was up-regulated and clustered at the sites of E. coli K1 on HBMEC in a CNF1-dependent manner. Pretreatment of CNF1+ E. coli K1 with recombinant 37-kDa laminin receptor precursor reduced the invasion rate to the level of Δcnf1 mutant, and the invasion rate of CNF1+ E. coli K1 was enhanced in 67LR-overexpressing HBMEC, indicating 67LR is involved in the CNF1+ E. coli K1 invasion of HBMEC. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis showed that, upon incubation with CNF1+ E. coli K1 but not with Δcnf1 mutant, focal adhesion kinase and paxillin were recruited and associated with 67LR. When immobilized onto polystyrene beads, CNF1 was sufficient to induce internalization of coupled beads into HBMEC through interaction with 67LR. Taken together, this is the first demonstration that E. coli K1 invasion of HBMEC occurs through the ligand-receptor (CNF1-67LR) interaction, and 67LR promotes CNF1-expressing E. coli K1 internalization of HBMEC.

The successful entry of invasive bacterial pathogens into the nonphagocytic cells such as endothelial and epithelial cells is the key to the establishment of several infectious diseases, including bacterial meningitis. Escherichia coli K1 is the major cause of neonatal bacterial meningitis, a serious illness associated with considerable mortality and morbidity (1Dawson K.G. Emerson J.C. Burns J.L. Pediatr. Infect. Dis. J. 1999; 18: 816-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 2Grimwood K. Anderson P. Anderson V. Tan L. Nolan T. Arch. Dis.

Most cases of bacterial meningitis develop as the result of hematogenous spread, but the mechanism(s) by which circulating bacteria cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) 1The abbreviations used are: BBB, blood-brain barrier; HBMEC, human brain microvascular endothelial cells; CNF1, cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1; 37LRP, 37-kDa laminin receptor precursor; 67LR, 67-kDa laminin receptor; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; r37LRP, recombinant 37LRP; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. is not completely understood. E. coli K1 invasion of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC), constituting the BBB, is a prerequisite for its penetration into the central nervous system in vivo (3Kim K.S. Infect.

Previous studies showed that E. coli K1 traversal of the BBB requires a high degree of bacteremia, binding to and internalization into HBMEC accompanying actin cytoskeleton rearrangements and related signaling pathways and traversal of the BBB as live bacteria (4Kim K.S. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 376-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Several E. coli structures are necessary for E. coli K1 invasion of HBMEC (e.g. the K1 capsule, CNF1, and Ibe proteins, AslA and TraJ), but it is unclear how all of these E. coli determinants contribute to HBMEC invasion in vitro and crossing of the BBB in vivo. Cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1) is a bacterial virulence factor associated with pathogenic E. coli strains causing meningitis and urinary tract infection (5Boquet P. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 1673-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). CNF1 is an AB-type toxin, composed of the N-terminal receptor-binding domain and the C-terminal catalytic domain possessing a deamidase activity. Through the site-specific deamidation of a Gln residue to Glu, CNF1 has been shown to permanently activate small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family such as Rho, Rac, and Cdc42. CNF1 has been suggested to be internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis upon binding to a cell surface receptor by a clathrin-independent and caveolin-independent mechanism (6Contamin S. Galmiche A. Doye A. Flatau G. Benmerah A. Boquet P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1775-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Once endocytosed, CNF1-containing vesicles are delivered to the late endosomes in a microtubule-dependent manner, and its C-terminal catalytic domain is translocated into the cytosol by the acidic pH-dependent manner to activate RhoGTPases (6Contamin S. Galmiche A. Doye A. Flatau G. Benmerah A. Boquet P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1775-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). CNF1 induces uptake of latex beads, bacteria, and apoptotic body into nonprofessional phagocytes such as epithelial and endothelial cells by macropinocytosis (7Fabbri A. Falzano L. Travaglione S. Stringaro A. Malorni W. Fais S. Fiorentini C. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2002; 291: 551-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Recent studies demonstrate that CNF1 exploits ubiquitin-proteosome machinery to restrict RhoGTPase activation, resulting in uropathogenic E. coli invasion of bladder cells (8Doye A. Mettouchi A.

We have reported previously (9Khan N.A. Wang Y. Kim K.J. Chung J.W. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15607-15611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) that CNF1 is a virulence factor contributing to E. coli K1 invasion of HBMEC in vitro and traversal of the BBB in vivo. Treatment of HBMEC with CNF1 enhances E. coli K1 invasion in the RhoA-dependent pathway (9Khan N.A. Wang Y. Kim K.J. Chung J.W. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15607-15611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear how CNF1-expressing E. coli invades HBMEC. Recently, a 37-kDa laminin receptor precursor (37LRP) has been identified as a CNF1-interacting protein from screening the cDNA library of HBMEC by the yeast two-hybrid system using the N-terminal domain of CNF1 as bait. In addition, the level of 37LRP expression is correlated with the cellular activities of CNF1 such as RhoA activation and bacterial uptake in HBMEC (10Chung J.W. Hong S.J. Kim K.J. Goti D. Stins M.F. Shin S. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16857-16862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). 37LRP, also known as p40, has been reported to be a ribosome-associated cytoplasmic protein and precursor of the 67-kDa laminin receptor (67LR). Even though the structure and maturation mechanism by which the 67LR is synthesized from the precursor is unclear, mature 67LR is present on the cell surface and functions as a membrane receptor for the adhesive basement membrane protein laminin (11Menard S. Tagliabue E. Colnaghi M.I. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1998; 52: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). 67LR has been found in a variety of cell types including brain endothelial cells. 67LR has been reported as the receptor for cellular prion protein and certain alphaviruses including Sindbis and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses for their binding and entry into mammalian host cells (12Gauczynski S. Peyrin J-M. Haik S. Leucht C. Hundt C. Rieger R. Krasemann S. Deslys J.-P. Dormont D. Lasmezas C.I. Weiss S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5863-5875Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 13Wang K.S.

Virol. 1996; 70: 5592-5599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Its increased expression is known as a prognostic marker for the invasive and metastatic tumors because of its enhanced expression in a wide variety of tumors including breast, ovary, lung, colon and prostate carcinomas, and lymphomas (11Menard S. Tagliabue E. Colnaghi M.I. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1998; 52: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the role of 67LR in the internalization of CNF1-expressing E. coli K1, and we demonstrated that the 67LR is an HBMEC protein interacting with CNF1, and their interaction promotes internalization of CNF1-expressing E. coli K1 and CNF1-immobilized beads into HBMEC. Bacterial Strains, Reagents, and Antibodies—CNF1+ E. coli K1 E44 strain is a spontaneous rifampin-resistant mutant derived from the cerebrospinal fluid isolate of a neonate with meningitis, strain RS218 (serotype O18:K1:H7, CNF1+). The isogenic Δcnf1 deletion mutant was generated and reported previously (9Khan N.A. Wang Y. Kim K.J. Chung J.W. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15607-15611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Anti-CNF1 monoclonal antibodies NG8 and JC4 were obtained from Dr. A. O'Brien (Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda). The laminin-based nonapeptide Cys-Asp-Pro-Gly-Tyr-Ile-Gly-Ser-Arg (CDPGYIGSR) and recognizing antibody were obtained from Dr. H. K. Kleinman (National Institutes of Health). Monoclonal (MLuC5) and polyclonal (Ab711) antibodies recognizing 67LR were purchased from NeoMarkers (Union City, CA) and Abcam Limited (Cambridge, UK), respectively. Anti-actin antibody was obtained from Sigma. Antibodies against FAK and paxillin were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY) and Immunocytometry Systems, respectively. HBMEC—Primary HBMEC were isolated and cultured as described previously (15Stins M.F. Gilles F. Kim K.S. J. Neuroimmunol. 1997; 76: 81-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Cells were grown on collagen-coated flasks in RPMI medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 10% NuSerum, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm pyruvate, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), essential amino acids, and vitamins. Transfection of HBMEC with 37LRP was performed as described previously (10Chung J.W. Hong S.J. Kim K.J. Goti D. Stins M.F. Shin S. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16857-16862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, a pcDNA3.1 vector harboring full-length 37lrp was delivered into HBMEC using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen), and transfectants were cloned after selection with G418 sulfate (800 μg/ml). Purification of Recombinant CNF1—Purification of recombinant GST-CNF1 was performed as described previously with a modification (10Chung J.W. Hong S.J. Kim K.J. Goti D. Stins M.F. Shin S. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16857-16862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, full-length cnf1 was cloned into pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) and introduced into E. coli XL1-Blue. Expression of GST-CNF1 was induced by incubation of culture in the presence of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 5 h at 25 °C. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in PBS with protease inhibitor mixture, and lysed by sonication. After another centrifugation, the bacterial lysate was incubated in 8 m urea for 30 min with rotation. The supernatant after centrifugation was resolved by SDS-PAGE to examine the expression of CNF1. The supernatant containing GST-CNF1 was dialyzed in serial dilutions of urea for refolding. GST-CNF1 in the final 2 m urea was incubated with glutathione-coupled agarose beads overnight at 4 °C with rotation and poured into a column. The column was washed with PBS, and bound GST-CNF1 was eluted with glutathione according to the manufacturer's protocol (Clontech). The presence of GST-CNF1 was confirmed by Western blot analysis with anti-CNF1 monoclonal antibody, and its functional activity was verified with the rhotekin assay described previously (10Chung J.W. Hong S.J. Kim K.J. Goti D. Stins M.F. Shin S. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16857-16862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Ligand Overlay Assay—Confluent monolayers of HBMEC were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed at 4 °C in RIPA buffer as described previously (8Doye A. Mettouchi A. Bossis G. Clement R. Buisson-Touati C. Flatau G. Gagnoux L. Piechaczyk M. Boquet P. Lemichez E. Cell. 2002; 111: 556-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Briefly, whole cell lysates were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane. After washing, the membrane was blocked with TBST (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) containing 4% skimmed milk for 1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight with CNF1 or CDPGYIGSR laminin peptide at 4 °C. After extensive washing, bound CNF1 and laminin peptide were detected with anti-CNF1 (NG8) and anti-CDPGYIGSR peptide antibodies, respectively. The membranes were subsequently visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HBMEC were grown on the collagen-coated glass coverslips until they reached confluence. Cells were incubated with either the parent E. coli E44 strain or isogenic Δcnf1 mutant for 30 min at 37 °C, and unbound bacteria were removed by extensive washing with PBS. Subsequently, cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence straining as described previously (16Kim K.J. Elliott S.J. Di Cello F. Stins M.F. Kim K.S. Cell. Microbiol. 2003; 5: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). 67LR and E. coli K1 were stained with MLuC5 and anti-OmpA antibodies, respectively. The binding of primary antibodies was visualized by incubation with Alexa-488 and Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). After washing with PBS, cells were mounted and examined with the fluorescence microscope (Olympus), and images were processed with Adobe Photoshop. Determination of 67LR on the HBMEC Surface—HBMEC grown in collagen-coated 24-well plates were incubated with CNF1+ E. coli K1 E44 strain or Δcnf1 mutant at 37 °C. After 30 min of incubation, HBMEC were washed three times with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with anti-67LR (MLuC5) antibody for 1 h, followed by incubation with Alexa-488 conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. Antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 10% normal goat serum. The cells were washed and immediately analyzed with a fluorescence spectrometer equipped with plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnydale, CA). Each set was run in triplicate. Bacterial Invasion and Association Assays—Bacterial invasion assays with gentamicin treatment were performed as described previously (16Kim K.J. Elliott S.J. Di Cello F. Stins M.F. Kim K.S. Cell. Microbiol. 2003; 5: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent cultures of HBMEC grown in 24-well plates were incubated with 107 of either the parent CNF1+ E. coli K1 E44 strain or isogenic Δcnf1 mutant in experimental medium at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 90 min in the absence or presence of recombinant 37LRP (final 10 μg/ml). Recombinant 37LRP was prepared as described previously (10Chung J.W. Hong S.J. Kim K.J. Goti D. Stins M.F. Shin S. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16857-16862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). HBMEC were washed with RPMI 1640 and incubated with experimental medium containing gentamicin (100 μg/ml) for 1 h to kill extracellular bacteria. The cells were washed again with PBS and lysed in distilled water. The released intracellular bacteria were enumerated by plating on sheep blood agar plates. Each set was run in triplicate, and the results are presented as percent invasion as compared with invasion rate of the CNF1+ E. coli K1 E44 strain, which was set at 100%. Bacterial association assays were carried out as described above for bacterial invasion assays except that the gentamicin treatment step was omitted. Results were expressed as percent association as compared with association rate of the CNF1+ E. coli K1 E44 strain, which was set at 100%. Coimmunoprecipitation—HBMEC were lysed in RIPA buffer at 4 °C as described above. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were collected for protein quantification. An equal amount of protein (500 μg) was incubated with protein A-beads for 1 h at 4 °C to remove nonspecifically bound proteins. After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with anti-67LR (Ab711) antibody for 2 h at 4 °C and further incubated with protein A-beads for another 1 h at 4 °C. Protein A-beads were washed with RIPA without deoxycholate, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. The blots were blocked with TBST containing 4% skimmed milk. After blocking, the membranes were incubated with primary antibody and horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody and subsequently visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). Binding and Internalization Assays with CNF1-immobilized Polystyrene Beads—Carboxylated fluorescent beads (1 μm in diameter, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were covalently coupled with GST-CNF1 (100 μg of protein) according to the manufacturer's protocol (Molecular Probes). GST alone was used to couple to beads as a negative control. Confluent cultures of HBMEC grown in collagen-coated 24-well plates were incubated with either CNF1- or GST-coupled beads (107/ml) for 1 h at 4 or 37 °C for binding or association assays, respectively. After washing three times with ice-cold PBS to remove unbound beads, the fluorescence intensity of bound beads in each well was measured with a fluorescence spectrometer equipped with plate reader (Molecular Devices). To determine the internalization of beads, HBMEC were incubated with coupled beads for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing three times with PBS, 0.04% trypan blue was added to each well for 10 min to quench the fluorescence from extracellular beads. Subsequently, the fluorescence intensity from internalized beads was measured. For antibody inhibition, HBMEC and coupled beads were pretreated with anti-67LR (MLuC5) at 4 °C and anti-CNF1 monoclonal antibodies at room temperature, respectively, for 1 h before proceeding to binding and internalization assays. Each set was run in triplicate. The cnf1 Deletion Mutant (Δcnf1) of E. coli K1 Is Defective in Invasion but Not in Binding to HBMEC—CNF1 has been shown to contribute to E. coli K1 invasion of HBMEC in vitro and traversal of the blood-brain barrier in the experimental hematogenous meningitis animal model (9Khan N.A. Wang Y. Kim K.J. Chung J.W. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15607-15611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To determine whether decreased invasion of the Δcnf1 mutant is because of their defective binding to the target cells, cell association and invasion assays were carried out with CNF1+ E. coli K1 E44 strain and Δcnf1 mutant (Fig. 1). The invasion frequency of the Δcnf1 mutant was reduced by 60% compared with that of E44, which is consistent with our previous report (9Khan N.A. Wang Y. Kim K.J. Chung J.W. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15607-15611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, the binding ability of the Δcnf1 mutant was comparable with that of E44, indicating that CNF1 participates in the E. coli K1 internalization of HBMEC and is not involved in bacterial binding to HBMEC. CNF1 Interacts with 67LR of HBMEC—We have shown previously that the 37LRP of HBMEC interacts with CNF1 of E. coli K1, and its expression level affects the activities of CNF1 such as RhoA activation and bacterial uptake (10Chung J.W. Hong S.J. Kim K.J. Goti D. Stins M.F. Shin S. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16857-16862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). 37LRP is shown to be a cytoplasmic protein and matured to 67LR, which is known to be present on the cell surface and binds to laminin with high affinity (17Rao C.N. Castronovo V. Schmitt M.C. Wewer U.M. Claysmith A.P. Liotta L.A. Sobel M.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7476-7486Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether CNF1 interacts with the 67LR of HBMEC. 67LR of HBMEC was detected with anti-67LR (Ab711) antibody (Fig. 2A, left). Ligand overlay assay showed that CNF1 interacted with a polypeptide showing the same molecular weight with 67LR (Fig. 2A, middle). Because a laminin-based CDPGYIGSR peptide has been shown to interact specifically with 67LR, we used this peptide to detect 67LR (18Scott W.N. McFerran N.V. Harriott P. Walker B. Nelson J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1481: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). When applied, the laminin CDPGYIGSR peptide also bound to the polypeptide, whose molecular weight is the same as that interacting with anti-67LR antibody and CNF1 (Fig. 2A, right). These findings indicate that CNF1 of E. coli K1 interacts with 67LR of HBMEC. Next, we examined the localization of 67LR in HBMEC using anti-67LR (MLuC5) monoclonal antibody. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that 67LR was abundant and present in the cytoplasm as well as cell membrane of the subconfluent culture of HBMEC (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the confluent culture of HBMEC monolayer exhibited much less total 67LR expression, most of which was found in the basal side of monolayer where cells are interacting with extracellular matrix (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that 67LR expression depends on the confluence of the HBMEC monolayer, which is consistent with the report published previously (19Donaldson E.A. McKenna D.J. McMullen C.B. Scott W.N. Stitt A.W. Nelson J. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun. 2000; 3: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) showing that 67LR expression is inhibited by contact inhibition. Taken together, our results indicate that CNF1 from E. coli K1 is able to interact with 67LR of the HBMEC monolayer. CNF1+ E. coli K1 Induces 67LR Clustering around the Bacteria on the Cell Surface of HBMEC—We have reported previously (9Khan N.A. Wang Y. Kim K.J. Chung J.W. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15607-15611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 10Chung J.W. Hong S.J. Kim K.J. Goti D. Stins M.F. Shin S. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16857-16862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) that CNF1 is a major bacterial determinant contributing to E. coli K1 invasion of HBMEC. To examine whether 67LR of HBMEC is involved in CNF1-expressing E. coli K1 invasion, confluent HBMEC monolayers were incubated with CNF1+ E. coli K1 E44 strain for 15 min at 37 °C, fixed, permeabilized, and stained with anti-67LR (MLuC5) to detect 67LR. The apical side of the confluent HBMEC monolayer showed very weak 67LR staining, and most 67LR was found at the basal side of the monolayer (Fig. 3C). However, 67LR was evident on the apical surface of the HBMEC monolayer where CNF1+ E. coli K1 was located, exhibiting 67LR clusters on HBMEC (Fig. 3B). In order to assess whether 67LR clusters are colocalized with adherent E. coli K1, the HBMEC monolayers incubated with CNF1+ E44 strain for 15 min were fixed and doubly immunostained with anti-67LR and anti-OmpA antibodies without permeabilization to visualize 67LR and E. coli K1, respectively. The 67LR clusters around adherent CNF1+ E. coli K1 were detected on the apical side of the unpermeabilized HBMEC monolayer (Fig. 3F, arrows). Because anti-67LR antibody (MLuC5) was able to exhibit 67LR clustering on the plasma membrane in unpermeabilized HBMEC, we omitted the permeabilization step in the further studies. Next, we examined whether the formation of 67LR clustering requires CNF1 expression in E. coli K1 (Fig. 4). In contrast to CNF1+ E. coli K1 E44 strain, the isogenic Δcnf1 mutant did not induce 67LR clustering on the apical side of the unpermeabilized HBMEC monolayer even though it bound to HBMEC with comparable efficiency (Fig. 4, D-F). These findings indicate that CNF1+ E. coli K1 interacts with 67LR of HBMEC and triggers 67LR clustering on the cell surface of HBMEC in a CNF1-dependent manner. 67LR Is Up-regulated in a CNF1-dependent Manner—Interactions of laminin or the YIGSR-containing laminin peptide with 67LR have been reported previously (20Romanov V.I. Wrathall L.S. Pinto da Simmons T.D. Silva P. Sobel M.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) to up-regulate 67LR expression in a time-dependent fashion. We next investigated whether the level of 67LR expression in HBMEC is affected by CNF1+ E. coli K1. The Western blot analysis demonstrated that the total amount of 67LR was increased in a time-dependent fashion when HBMEC were incubated with CNF1+ E. coli K1 E44 bacteria (Fig. 5A, top). In contrast, the comparable increase of 67LR was not detected when HBMEC were incubated with the Δcnf1 mutant (Fig. 5A, bottom), indicating that E. coli K1 increases 67LR expression of HBMEC in a CNF1-dependent manner. Of interest, the 67LR expression was somewhat decreased at 90 min of incubation with the Δcnf1 mutant. In addition, to assess whether CNF1+ E. coli K1-induced 67LR up-regulation occurs on the apical side of the HBMEC monolayer, confluent cultures of the HBMEC monolayer were incubated with either CNF1+ E44 or Δcnf1 mutant for the indicated times, and the level of 67LR on the apical surface of HBMEC monolayer was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown Fig. 5B, the amount of 67LR expressed on the apical side was increased by 2-fold in HBMEC incubated with CNF1+ E44, compared with nonincubated HBMEC. The up-regulation of 67LR was evident after 30 min of incubation and was maintained up to 60 min. However, the 67LR expression remained unchanged in HBMEC incubated with the Δcnf1 mutant, indicating that CNF1 of E. coli K1 is responsible for the 67LR up-regulation, especially on the apical surface of HBMEC monolayer. 67LR Is Required for the CNF1-dependent E. coli K1 Invasion of HBMEC—Our previous report (10Chung J.W. Hong S.J. Kim K.J. Goti D. Stins M.F. Shin S. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16857-16862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) demonstrated that CNF1-mediated RhoA activation and bacterial uptake are modulated by exogenous r37LRP or transfection of HBMEC with 37LRP. Therefore, we investigated whether CNF1 interaction with 67LR is required for HBMEC invasion by CNF1+ E. coli K1. In vitro bacterial invasion assays with gentamicin treatment were performed in the presence of r37LRP to block the interaction between CNF1 and 67LR. Pretreatment of the CNF1+ E. coli K1 E44 strain with r37LRP decreased the invasion rate by 50% compared with GST control pretreatment. In contrast, the invasion rate of the Δcnf1 mutant was not affected by r37LRP (Fig. 6A). These results indicate that exogenous r37LRP competes against 67LR of HBMEC and reduces CNF1+ E. coli K1 invasion to the level of the Δcnf1 mutant. Next, invasion assays were carried out with 37LRP-transfected HBMEC, which have demonstrated previously (10Chung J.W. Hong S.J. Kim K.J. Goti D. Stins M.F. Shin S. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16857-16862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) greater CNF1 binding than the control pcDNA vector-transfected HBMEC. The 37LRP-transfected HBMEC exhibited greater"
https://openalex.org/W2155670123,"Partitioning of proteins in cholesterol and sphingolipid enriched plasma membrane microdomains, called lipid rafts, is critical for many signal transduction and protein sorting events. Although raft partitioning of many signaling molecules remains to be determined, glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol (GPI)-anchored proteins possess high affinity for lipid rafts and are currently exploited as markers to investigate fundamental mechanisms in protein sorting and signal transduction events. In this study, we demonstrate that two recombinant GPI-anchored green fluorescent proteins (GFP-GPIs) that differ in their GPI signal sequence confer distinct localization in plasma membrane microdomains. GFP fused to the GPI signal of the decay accelerating factor GFP-GPI(DAF) partitioned exclusively in lipid rafts, whereas GFP fused to the GPI signal of TRAIL-R3, GFP-GPI(TRAIL-R3), associated only minimally with microdomains. In addition, we investigated the unique ability of purified GFP-GPIs to insert into membrane microdomains of primary lymphocytes. This cell surface painting allows rapid, stable, and functional association of the GPI-anchored proteins with the target cell plasma membrane. The distinct membrane localization of the two GFP-GPIs was observed irrespective of whether the GPI-anchored molecules were painted or transfected. Furthermore, we show that painted GFP-GPI(DAF) was totally dependent on the GPI anchor and that the membrane insertion was increased by the addition of raft-associated lipids such as cholesterol, sphingomyelin, and dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine. Thus, this study provides evidence that different GPI signal sequences lead to distinct membrane microdomain localization and that painted GFP-GPI(DAF) serves as an excellent fluorescent marker for lipid rafts in live cells."
https://openalex.org/W2020382165,"Numerous human in vivo studies on skeletal muscle gene expression have investigated the effects of given interventions. These have been founded on the assumption that presampling can be regarded as a representative control for postintervention sampling. However, many genes are responsive to the metabolic status, which varies during the day, so that observed differences in gene expression between the pre- and post-sample may therefore be a result of the daily variations rather than an intervention. Furthermore, the sampling itself can cause a local stress response, which may also influence the expression of some genes in later samples from the same localized area. To test this, we performed a short-term human endurance exercise study in which muscle biopsies were obtained from healthy untrained individuals (n=14) before and in the hours after exercise to measure the expression of mRNA for previously reported exercise-related genes (e.g., PPARgamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), MyoD, p21, (heat shock protein 72 (HSP72), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), citrate synthase (CS), and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4)). To test for changes unrelated to exercise, one half of the subjects did not exercise. As suspected, several presumed exercise-induced genes were induced even without the exercise. Our data demonstrate that presampling is not always a representative control for postintervention sampling, illustrating that use of presampling can cause erroneous interpretations of the underlying induction signals."

We questioned whether DNA methylation and histone deacetylation overlap in the regulation of endogenous plant genes by monitoring changes in expression of ∼7800 Arabidopsis thaliana genes following treatment with azadC, TSA, or both chemicals together. RNA levels for ∼4% of the genes were reproducibly changed 3-fold or more by at least one treatment. Distinct subsets of genes are up-regulated or down-regulated in response to aza-dC, TSA, or simultaneous treatment with both chemicals, with little overlap among subsets. Surprisingly, the microarray data indicate that TSA and aza-dC are often antagonistic rather than synergistic in their effects. Analysis of green fluorescent protein transgenic plants confirmed this finding, showing that TSA can block the up-regulation of silenced green fluorescent protein transgenes in response to aza-dC or a ddm1 (decrease in DNA methylation 1) mutation. Our results indicate that global inhibition of DNA methylation or histone deacetylation has complex, nonredundant effects for the majority of responsive genes and suggest that activation of some genes requires one or more TSA-sensitive deacetylation events in addition to cytosine demethylation.

Covalent modifications of DNA and histones play important roles in regulating gene expression in eukaryotes. Active genes tend to display relatively little cytosine methylation (hypomethylation) and are associated with hyperacetylated histones (1Dobosy J.R. Selker E.U. Cell Mol.

By contrast, DNA of silenced chromatin such as pericentromeric repeats, transposable elements, telomere-associated repeats, or inactive X chromosomes in somatic cells of female mammals typically displays cytosine hypermethylation and histone hypoacetylation (6Grewal S.I.

DNA methylation and histone deacetylation are thought to be important for the assembly of dense chromatin conformations (heterochromatin) that prevent activator proteins and general transcription factors from gaining access to enhancers and promoters (6Grewal S.I. Moazed D. Science. 2003; 301: 798-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, 11Chow J.C. Brown C.J. Cell Mol.

However, heterochromatin formation is reversible, such that inhibitors of cytosine methylation or histone deacetylation can often derepress silenced genes (15Taddei A. Maison C. Roche D. Almouzni G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 16Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 17Haaf T.

Several lines of evidence suggest that DNA methylation and histone deacetylation are mechanistically linked in gene silencing processes. For instance, silenced rRNA genes in both plants and animals can be derepressed by 5-aza-2′ deoxycytosine (aza-dC) 1The abbreviations used are: aza-dC, 5-aza-2′-deoxycytosine; TSA, trichostatin A; AFGC, Arabidopsis Functional Genomics Consortium; RT, reverse transcription; GFP, green fluorescent protein; SUID, Stanford Microarray data base unique identifier. 1The abbreviations used are: aza-dC, 5-aza-2′-deoxycytosine; TSA, trichostatin A; AFGC, Arabidopsis Functional Genomics Consortium; RT, reverse transcription; GFP, green fluorescent protein; SUID, Stanford Microarray data base unique identifier. or by trichostatin A (TSA) (20Chen Z.J. Pikaard C.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2124-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 21Lawrence R.J. Earley K. Pontes O. Silva M. Chen Z.J. Neves N. Viegas W. Pikaard C.S. Mol.

Importantly, treatment with both chemicals together is no more effective at derepressing silenced rRNA genes than treatment with either chemical alone, suggesting that DNA methylation and histone deacetylation act in partnership in the same rRNA gene repression pathway (20Chen Z.J. Pikaard C.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2124-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Biochemical evidence has supported this interpretation by showing that methylcytosine binding domain proteins stably associated with histone deacetylases in multiprotein complexes that repress transcription from methylated templates (24Jones P.L. Veenstra G.J. Wade P.A. Vermaak D. Kass S.U. Lands-berger N. Strouboulis J. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (2236) Google Scholar, 25Nan X. Ng H.H. Johnson C.A.

One early model for gene silencing consistent with these data suggested a linear repression pathway in which DNA methylation brings about histone deacetylation in order to cause gene silencing (24Jones P.L. Veenstra G.J. Wade P.A. Vermaak D. Kass S.U. Lands-berger N. Strouboulis J. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (2236) Google Scholar, 25Nan X. Ng H.H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenman R.N. Bird A. Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2770) Google Scholar). According to this hypothesis, preventing DNA methylation with aza-dC would prevent recruitment of histone deacetylases and thereby prevent silencing. Alternatively, blocking histone deacetylation with TSA downstream of DNA methylation in the repression pathway would also prevent silencing, such that the effects of aza-dC and TSA would appear to be redundant. However, blocking histone deacetylation with TSA or by genetic knockdown of histone deacetylase activity has been shown to bring about the loss of cytosine methylation at some genes in plants and Neurospora (21Lawrence R.J. Earley K. Pontes O. Silva M. Chen Z.J. Neves N. Viegas W. Pikaard C.S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 599-609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 29Selker E.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9430-9435Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutations that prevent histone H3 lysine 9 methylation (a modification dependent on prior lysine 9 deacetylation) also blocks all or some cytosine methylation in Neurospora and plants, respectively (30Tamaru H. Selker E.U. Nature. 2001; 414: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 31Jackson J.P. Lindroth A.M. Cao X. Jacobsen S.E.

These latter indications of cross-talk between DNA and histone modifications suggest that the redundant effects of aza-dC and TSA might also be explained if DNA methylation were the key determinant of gene silencing rather than histone deacetylation. Aza-dC and TSA have been shown to act synergistically in the derepression of tumor suppressor genes and other cancer-related genes that display aberrant cytosine methylation (33Lindemann R.K. Gabrielli B. Johnstone R.W. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 779-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 34Momparler R.L.

Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2164-2171PubMed Google Scholar), with aza-dC having the dominant effect (37Cameron E.E. Bachman K.E. Myohanen S. Herman J.G. Baylin S.B. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (1677) Google Scholar). Likewise, the silenced fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene can be reactivated in human cell lines by aza-dC but is synergistically up-regulated by combining aza-dC with TSA (39Chiurazzi P. Pomponi M.G. Pietrobono R. Bakker C.E. Neri G. Oostra B.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2317-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). TSA alone has little effect on FMR1 expression. These data are consistent with the idea that DNA methylation and histone deacetylation act in partnership, although not redundantly, such that inhibition of both processes is needed for full effect. However, other studies have identified genes that are up-regulated by inhibiting DNA methylation but not by inhibiting histone deacetylation. For instance, a microarray analysis of gene expression in human colorectal cancer cells showed that histone deacetylase inhibitors alone could derepress some genes, but not those silenced genes that possessed hypermethylated CpG islands; only aza-dC derepressed these latter genes (40Suzuki H. Gabrielson E. Chen W. Anbazhagan R. van Engeland M. Weijenberg M.P. Herman J.G. Baylin S.B. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). Collectively, the available evidence implicates both histone deacetylation and DNA methylation in gene silencing but suggests that the two processes can sometimes be intimately linked and in other circumstances can display varying degrees of autonomy. To evaluate the consequences of global inhibition of DNA methylation and/or histone deacetylation on the expression of endogenous genes in plants, we used DNA microarrays to perform transcript profiling in Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that distinct subsets of genes are activated by aza-dC, by TSA, or by both chemicals together. Likewise, distinct subsets of genes are repressed by these treatments. Interestingly, TSA represses more often than it activates and can block, rather than assist, the up-regulation of genes that respond to cytosine demethylation, a response not reported in prior studies in nonplant systems. Our results suggest that cytosine methylation and histone deacetylation are epigenetic modifications that interact in complex ways to help establish gene expression states in the plant genome. Plant Growth and Chemical Treatments—Seeds were sterilized with 70% ethanol, 0.05% Triton X-100 for 10 min and then washed with 95% ethanol, 0.05% Triton X-100 for 10 min. A final wash with 95% ethanol was for 10 min. Sterilized seeds were air-dried and sown on deep Petri plates containing semisolid MS germination medium (41Valvekens D. Van Montagu M. Van Lijsebettens M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5536-5540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar) that had been sterilized by autoclaving. aza-dC and/or TSA were added to the medium just before plates were poured. Both chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Aza-dC (in water) was added to a final concentration of 7 μg/ml. TSA (in methanol) was added to a final concentration of 0.5 μm. These same concentrations were used in plates containing both chemicals. These conditions are known to derepress silenced rRNA genes subjected to nucleolar dominance and to induce changes in rRNA gene DNA methylation, histone acetylation, and histone methylation (20Chen Z.J. Pikaard C.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2124-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 21Lawrence R.J. Earley K. Pontes O. Silva M. Chen Z.J. Neves N. Viegas W. Pikaard C.S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 599-609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). After sowing seeds, plates were incubated for 2 days at 4 °C to help synchronize germination and then transferred to a growth chamber and grown using a 16-h light/8-h dark, 22 °C growth regime. Plants not used for microarray experiments were grown in a mixture of 60% Redi-Earth™ (Scotts), 40% vermiculite in environmental growth chambers (16-h day length at 70% relative humidity, 22 °C) or in a greenhouse. RNA Preparation—For microarray analyses, total RNA was isolated from 16-day-old plantlets grown on sterile medium at a density of ∼100 seedlings/100-mm diameter plate. Seedlings from ∼20 plates were harvested to obtain mock treatment (control) RNA needed for each microarray slide hybridization, whereas seedlings from six plates each were harvested for the aza-dC, TSA, and aza-dC + TSA treatments. Total RNA was isolated using a modification of the procedure of Chomczynski and Sacchi (42Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63145) Google Scholar), according to the protocol of the Arabidopsis Functional Genomics Consortium (AFGC; available on the World Wide Web at www.arabidopsis.org/info/2010_projects/comp_proj/AFGC/RevisedAFGC/site2RnaL.htm#isolation). Briefly, 1 g of whole seedlings grown on sterile medium were harvested into liquid nitrogen and ground to a fine powder with a mortar and pestle. The powder was then transferred into a plastic screw cap centrifuge tube containing 15 ml of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Samples were mixed thoroughly and incubated for 5 min at 60 °C. Tissues were then subjected to two cycles of homogenization, 15 s each, using a Fisher Powergen homogenizer at high speed. Homogenates were then centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min to remove insoluble debris. The supernatant was transferred into a fresh screw cap centrifuge tube, mixed with 3 ml of chloroform, and again subjected to centrifugation. The aqueous phase was then collected, and total RNA was precipitated by the addition of 0.5 volumes (v/v) of a 0.8 m sodium citrate, 1.2 m NaCl solution, and 0.5 volumes (v/v) of cold (-20 °C) isopropyl alcohol. The RNA pellet was collected by centrifugation, washed with 20 ml of 75% ethanol, and air-dried. RNA was resuspended in 250 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water and 1 μl of RNase inhibitor (Promega) was added. Poly(A)+ mRNA was isolated from 200 μg of total RNA using an Oligotex mRNA Mini Prep Kit (Qiagen). Absorbance at 260 and 280 nm was determined for poly(A)+ fractions, yielding A260/A280 ratios of 1.9-2.0. RNA quality was assessed according to AFGC guidelines (available on the World Wide Web at www.arabidopsis.org/info/2010_projects/comp_proj/AFGC/RevisedAFGC/site2RnaL.htm#isolation). First, RNA blots were probed for EF1-α mRNA, revealing distinct bands of the expected size, ∼1.5 kb, an indication that the RNA was not degraded. Poly(A)+ mRNA quality was further evaluated by determining the size range of first strand cDNA primed with oligo(dT) and synthesized in the presence of 10 μCi of α-labeled dCTP and exposed to x-ray film. The most intense labeling was in the 1-4-kb size range, as expected for high quality Arabidopsis mRNA. Control and treated seedlings were grown in two independent experiments, and total RNA and poly(A)+ RNA were isolated independently and quality-controlled each time. Poly(A)+ RNAs from seedlings grown twice independently were then pooled for microarray analysis. Microarray Data Analysis—cDNA probes labeled with fluorescent Cy3 and Cy5-dUTP were synthesized and hybridized to A. thaliana cDNA microarrays at the AFGC microarray facility at Michigan State University as described (43Schaffer R. Landgraf J. Accerbi M. Simon V. Larson M. Wisman E. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) (available on the World Wide Web at www.arabidopsis.org/info/2010_projects/comp_proj/AFGC/RevisedAFGC/site2RnaL.htm#isolation). The microarrays contain a set of 11,521 Arabidopsis expressed sequence tags representing an estimated 7800 unique genes, printed on glass slides (43Schaffer R. Landgraf J. Accerbi M. Simon V. Larson M. Wisman E. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) (available on the World Wide Web at www.arabidopsis.org/info/2010_projects/comp_proj/AFGC/RevisedAFGC/site2RnaL.htm). Following hybridization, microarrays were scanned using a ScanArray 4000 Microarray Acquisition System (Packard BioChip Technologies). Raw data extracted from the images was uploaded to the Stanford Microarray Database (available on the World Wide Web at www.genome-www5.stanford.edu/MicroArray/SMD/) (44Gollub J. Ball C.A. Binkley G. Demeter J. Finkelstein D.B. Hebert J.M. Hernandez-Boussard T. Jin H. Kaloper M. Matese J.C. Schroeder M. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Sherlock G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 94-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), experiment ID numbers 23480-23482, 26629-26635, 26644, 26647, and 27031. The microarray data are also deposited in the NCBI GEO data base (available on the World Wide Web at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) under accession numbers GSE1612, GPL1381, GPL1382, GSM27518, GSM27519, GSM27520, GSM27521, GSM27522, GSM27523, GSM27524, GSM27525, GSM27526, GSM27527, GSM27528, GSM27529, and GSM27530. Each transcript profiling experiment was independently repeated four times, twice each with control and treatment probes labeled with Cy3 and Cy5, respectively, and twice with the dye colors reversed. Normalization of Cy3 and Cy5 channels was by the Z-score method as described (43Schaffer R. Landgraf J. Accerbi M. Simon V. Larson M. Wisman E. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Spots flagged with abnormal intensity, empty or misshapen spots, and duplicated control spots were all excluded from the working data set for each slide. For cluster analysis, data were further filtered using the following criteria: regression correlation >0.6, mean channel intensity values >2.5, the median background intensity in at least one of the two channels, and normalized mean channel intensity >350 in at least one of the two channels. Two microarray slides for the aza-dC + TSA treatment failed to meet quality control standards for spot quality and signal/noise ratio following hybridization, and their data was excluded from the data set. As an additional data filtration step, we imposed a cut-off of log (base 2) absolute value >1.585 for treated versus control so as to select genes that were up- or down-regulated greater than 3-fold on each slide. For aza-dC-treated and TSA-treated groups, we next limited our cluster analysis to those genes showing a >3-fold change in at least three of the four slides. For the aza-dC + TSA treatment group, because of the availability of only two slides, only SUIDs with normalized intensity ratio >3-fold on both slides were included. Last, mean and S.D. values computed for chemical-treated and mock-treated controls were used to perform un-paired Student's t tests using log (base 10)-transformed normalized intensity ratios. Uncorrected p values < 0.05 (5.0E-02 in scientific notation) were considered statistically significant (95% confidence). Only genes responding to chemical treatment by 3-fold or more and passing the filtration criteria and statistical tests described above are listed in Supplemental Table I. Due to the stringency of these criteria, many responsive genes that passed either the filtration steps or p value test, but not both, are not included in Supplemental Table I. Genes in this latter category that were tested to verify their responsiveness in Figs. 3 and 4 include the following: At2g14610 (aza-dC up-regulated 5.86 ± 3.13-fold (S.D.), p = 5.58E-02); At3g29650 (aza-dC up-regulated 19.33 ± 13.19-fold, p = 9.35E-02); At3g14210 (aza-dC up-regulated 3.74 ± 0.53-fold, p = 2.29E-03); At2g14620 (aza-dC up-regulated 7.39 ± 2.89-fold, p = 1.9E-02); At1g05680 (aza-dC up-regulated 8.73 ± 0.98-fold, p = 3.37E-04); At3g27060 (aza-dC up-regulated 4.05 ± 1.41-fold, p = 5.95E-03), At3g02850 (TSA down-regulated 10.62 ± 1.77-fold, p = 7.96E-05), At4g24380 (TSA down-regulated 7.23 fold ± 1.23 S.D., p = 2.67E-03).Fig. 3Genes up-regulated by aza-dC are also up-regulated in mutants affecting cytosine methylation or methylation-related gene silencing. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis was conducted to compare expression levels of aza-dC up-regulated genes At2g14610 and At3g29650 and TSA up-regulated gene At4g26700 in plants treated with aza-dC and/or TSA or in homozygous mom1, ddm1, met1, cmt3, drm1/drm2, or kyp mutants.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4Comparison of quantitative RT-PCR and microarray data for six genes whose up-regulation by aza-dC is inhibited by simultaneous treatment with TSA.

For the analysis of RNA purified from genetic mutants, total RNA was isolated from leaves of 28-day-old plants using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), followed by in-column digestion with DNase I according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA-free RNA was converted to cDNA by reverse transcription (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative real time PCR was performed using an ABI 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) to monitor SYBR green fluorescence. Two independently mixed PCRs for each of two independently purified RNA samples (four reactions in total) were amplified for each gene tested. Melting curves were performed for each reaction to verify that a single product had been amplified. The ubiquitin 10 gene (UBQ10) was amplified as a control because preliminary experiments had shown its expression to be unaffected by aza-dC or TSA. PCR conditions were 10 min at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles of the following: 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C.

Microarray Detection of Genes Responsive to Aza-dC and TSA—To isolate RNA for transcript profiling on DNA microarrays, we grew A. thaliana (ecotype Columbia) seedlings on four types of sterile growth medium: one containing no chromatin-modifying agents, one containing aza-dC, one containing TSA, and one containing both aza-dC and TSA. After 16 days of growth, plantlets were harvested, and poly(A)+ RNA was purified. Cy3- and Cy5-labeled probes were then generated for each RNA sample, and differentially labeled control and treatment (aza-dC, TSA, or both) probe pairs were hybridized to AFGC cDNA microarrays (45Finkelstein D. Ewing R. Gollub J. Sterky F. Cherry J.M. Somerville S. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 48: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The microarrays contained 11,521 unique Arabidopsis expressed sequence tag elements (SUIDs), representing an estimated 7800 unique genes. Approximately 400 SUIDs, representing 364 genes, passed the stringent data filtration steps and were altered in their expression by at least 3-fold by aza-dC, TSA, or aza-dC + TSA (Supplemental Table I). Hierarchical cluster analysis of the expression data for these SUIDs across the various microarray experiments is displayed in Fig. 1. The cytosine methylation inhibitor, aza-dC, altered the expression of 125 of these genes, with 73 being up-regulated (red horizontal lines) and 52 down-regulated (green horizontal lines). Treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA affected 37 genes by 3-fold or more. Interestingly, among the 37 genes affected by TSA, 34 were down-regulated, and only 3 were up-regulated (note that additional genes are up-regulated by TSA alone and appear red in Fig. 1 but are changed less than 3-fold). The combination of aza-dC and TSA yielded the greatest changes in gene expression, with 232 genes displaying changes of >3-fold. Among these, 158 are down-regulated, and 74 are up-regulated. Interestingly, relatively few of the genes that respond to the combination of aza-dC and TSA respond in a similar way to either chemical alone. For instance, more than half of the aza-dC up-regulated genes (group in red at the bottom right of Fig. 1) are no longer up-regulated when treated with aza-dC and TSA in combination. Likewise, a group of genes down-regulated by aza-dC alone or by TSA alone (groups in green midway down the TSA and Aza columns in Fig. 1) are expressed at control levels following combined treat"
https://openalex.org/W2129436053,"Type II fatty acid synthesis (FASII) is essential to bacterial cell viability and is a promising target for the development of novel antibiotics. In the past decade, a few inhibitors have been identified for this pathway, but none of them lend themselves to drug development. To find better inhibitors that are potential drug candidates, we developed a high throughput assay that identifies inhibitors simultaneously against multiple targets within the FASII pathway of most bacterial pathogens. We demonstrated that the inverse t½ value of the FASII enzyme-catalyzed reaction gives a measure of FASII activity. The Km values of octanoyl-CoA and lauroyl-CoA were determined to be 1.1 ± 0.3 and 10 ± 2.7 μm in Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis, respectively. The effects of free metals and reducing agents on enzyme activity showed an inhibition hierarchy of Zn2+ > Ca2+ > Mn2+ > Mg2+; no inhibition was found with β-mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol. We used this assay to screen the natural product libraries and isolated an inhibitor, bischloroanthrabenzoxocinone (BABX) with a new structure. BABX showed IC50 values of 11.4 and 35.3 μg/ml in the S. aureus and Escherichia coli FASII assays, respectively, and good antibacterial activities against S. aureus and permeable E. coli strains with minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 0.4 μg/ml. Furthermore, the effectiveness, selectivity, and the in vitro and in vivo correlations of BABX as well as other fatty acid inhibitors were elucidated, which will aid in future drug discovery.

Infectious disease is a global problem, and the development of drug resistance is a major issue for all classes of antibiotics. Therefore, development of new high throughput assays for simultaneous screening of multiple targets to rapidly identify novel antibiotics is crucial. Fatty acids are essential for viability.

In this study, we developed and validated a reliable high throughput fatty acid synthesis pathway assay that can simultaneously identify inhibitors of multiple targets, including FabD, FabF/B, FabG, FabA/Z, and FabI. We screened natural product extract libraries and identified and characterized bischloroanthrabenzoxocinone (BABX) as a new inhibitor of fatty acid synthesis. We also investigated the kinetics of pathway enzymes, the selectivity of fatty acid synthesis inhibitors, as well as the relationship of biochemical activities and antibacterial activity. Reagents—All reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. DTT was from Fisher (BP172-5); perchloric acid (70%) was from Fluka Chemika (77230); and β-mercaptoethanol was from Bio-Rad (161-0710). [14C]Malonyl-CoA (60 mCi/mmol, NEC612), [3H]acetyl-CoA (NET290250UC), phospholipid 96-well Flashplates (SMP108), and other radiolabeled chemicals used in this study were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. ACP (Sigma, A7303) was pretreated with 3 mm DTT on ice for 20 min, aliquoted, and stored at -80 °C. Preparation of Type II Fatty Acid Synthesis Enzymes—The procedure described previously (24Tsay J. Rock C. Jackowski S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 508-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used with some modification. Briefly, K12-derivative Escherichia coli strains, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus subtilis were grown to stationary phase in 6 liters of LB medium. The cultures were centrifuged at 8,000 rpm for 10 min using a Beckman JA-10 rotor. The pellets were washed twice with ice-cold buffer A (0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and resuspended in 500 ml of the same buffer. The cells were lysed in a cold microfluidizer (Microfluidics Corp., M-110EH) at 18,000 lbs per square inch and centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C using a Beckman JA-20 rotor. The supernatant was collected, and its volume was precisely measured. Ammonium sulfate (129 g) was added to each 500 ml of the supernatant in small quantities with low speed stirring at 4 °C to reach 45% ammonium sulfate saturation. The mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant was collected. Ammonium sulfate (113 g) was then added to each 500 ml of the supernatant to reach 80% ammonium sulfate saturation. The mixture was centrifuged again, and the supernatant was then discarded. The 45–80% ammonium sulfate saturated protein fraction pellet, containing all necessary fatty acid synthesis (FASII) enzymes, was dissolved in 20 ml of buffer A, dialyzed at 4 °C against four changes of buffer A using 10-kDa molecular mass cutoff dialysis tubing (Invitrogen, 15961-022), and then concentrated. The protein concentration was determined using the standard Bio-Rad protocol. The protein was aliquoted, flash frozen using liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. FASII Assay—The assay was performed in a Phospholipid 96-well Flashplate. Routinely, 3 μg of the partially purified protein containing fatty acid synthesis enzymes were preincubated with a serial dilution of natural products or synthetic compounds at room temperature for 20 min in 50 μl of buffer containing 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm NADPH, 1 mm NADH, 150 μm DTT, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20 μmn-octanoyl-CoA (or lauroyl-CoA), 4% Me2SO, and 5 μm of the pretreated ACP. The reaction was initiated by addition of 10 μlof water-diluted [14C]malonyl-CoA (the label is at C-2 of the malonyl group), which gave a final concentration of 4 μm malonyl-CoA with total counts of about 20,000 (84 cpm/pmol) or 10,000 CPM (42 cpm/pmol) using Beckman Coulter LS6500 and Packard TopCount NXT scintillation counters, respectively. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min for E. coli and 60 min for S. aureus and B. subtilis. The reaction was terminated by adding 100 μl of 14% perchloric acid. The plates were sealed, incubated at room temperature overnight with mild shaking, and counted for 5 min using the TopCount counter. Through hydrophobic interactions, long hydrophobic acyl chains of acyl-ACP bind to the phospholipids on the surface of the well, which are coated with scintillant. This binding brings the incorporated 14C into proximity of the scintillant resulting in the emission of a photon, which is captured by a scintillation counter. All data were analyzed using Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Whole Cell Labeling Assay—The assay was performed as previously described (25Onishi H.R. Pelak B.A. Gerckens L.S. Silver L.L. Kahan F.M. Chen M-H. Patchett A.A. Galloway S.M. Hyland S.A. Anderson M.S. Raetz C.R.H. Science. 1996; 274: 980-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Briefly, mid-log (A600 = 0.5–0.6) growth bacteria (E. coli and S. aureus) were incubated with 1 μCi/ml 2-[3H]glycerol, 1 μCi/ml 6-[3H]thymidine, 1 μCi/ml 5,6-[3H]uracil, 5 μCi/ml 4,5-[3H]leucine, and 5 μCi/ml 2,3-[3H]alanine (or 2-[3H]glycine) for phospholipid, DNA, RNA, protein, and cell wall, respectively, at an increasing concentration of each inhibitor at 37 °C for 20 min. Cell wall labeling with 2,3-[3H]alanine (E. coli) or 2-[3H]glycine (S. aureus) was performed in the presence of 100 μg/ml chloramphenicol, which blocks protein synthesis. The reaction was stopped by adding 10% trichloroacetic acid and harvested using a glass fiber filter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, 1205-401). The filter was dried and counted with scintillation fluid. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration—The MIC against each of the strains was determined as previously described (26Wang J. Galgoci A. Kodali S. Herath K.B. Jayasuriya H. Dorso K. Vicente F. Gonzalez A. Cully D. Bramhill D. Singh S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44424-44428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Cells were inoculated at 105 colony-forming units/ml followed by incubation at 37 °C with a serial dilution of compounds in LB broth for 20 h. MIC is defined as the lowest concentration of antibiotic inhibiting visible growth. E. coli Strain Construction—All strains in this study are listed in Table I. MB4902 E. coli (lpxC), MB5747 E. coli (tolC), and MB5746 E. coli (lpxC and tolC) strains were constructed using standard P1 transduction methodology (27Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics.

Methods Enzymol. 1962; 5: 443-451Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, the FASII assay that we developed uses long-chain acyl-CoA (octanoyl-CoA or lauroyl-CoA) instead of acetyl-CoA. Therefore, our FASII assay measures the cumulative activities of enzymes involved in the fatty acid elongation cycle only, avoiding the complexity of the chain initiation reaction steps catalyzed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (AccABCD) and FabH. To determine enzyme activity and set up proper conditions for the assay, we titrated the FASII enzyme mixture from E. coli (S. aureus and B. subtilis, data not shown) in a time course study (Fig. 2A) at 37 °C. The t½ values are 3.2 ± 0.3, 6.7 ± 1.0, 12.4 ± 1.0, and 26.9 ± 2.3 min, respectively, for 1.5, 3, 6, and 12 μg of the FASII enzyme mixture added per assay. The plot of t½ values against each concentration of the enzyme mixture results in a linear correlation (Fig. 2B), indicating that t½ (or apparent rate constant) gives a measure of the activity of the FASII enzymes (31Wang J. Tu Y. Mukhopadhyay S. Chidiac P. Biddlecome G.H. Ross E.M. Manning D.R. G Proteins: Techniques of Analysis. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1999: 123-151Google Scholar). Determination of Enzyme Kinetics—The assay was performed under standard conditions, and the apparent Km Km(app) and Vmax of the FASII enzymes were determined. The Km(app) and Vmax of S. aureus FASII enzymes for octanoyl-CoA were 1.1 ± 0.3 μm and 88.9 ± 4.5 pmol/min/mg, respectively (Fig. 3A). The Km(app) and Vmax of B. subtilis FASII enzymes were 10.0 ± 2.7 μm and 516 ± 31 pmol/min/mg, respectively, for lauroyl-CoA (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained by interchanging octanoyl-CoA and lauroyl-CoA (data not shown). The experiments were repeated at least twice with duplicates. The Effect of Metals and Reducing Agents on FASII—To ascertain the robustness of the assay for use with natural product extracts which may contain metals and chelators, the effect of divalent cations and EDTA on FASII activity was examined (Fig. 4). With the addition of EDTA, inhibition of FASII activity by Mg2+, Ca2+, Zn2+, and Mn2+ exhibited IC50 values of 81 ± 17, 9.1 ± 6.2, 5.6 ± 3, and 19.4 ± 7.6 mm, respectively. Without the addition of 5 mm EDTA, the inhibition of FASII activity by these metals was reduced, resulting in IC50 values of 76 ± 16, 4.0 ± 0.9, 0.3 ± 0.09, and 14 ± 4.5 mm for Mg2+, Ca2+, Zn2+, and Mn2+, respectively. Neither potassium nor sodium demonstrated any inhibitory effects on FASII activity until the concentration reached 300 mm (data not shown). These experiments were repeated at least three times in duplicate. Efficacy and Selectivity of FASII Inhibitors across Multiple Bacterial Species—Assays were performed with three FASII inhibitors in three different bacterial species. In the E. coli FASII enzyme assay, cerulenin, thiolactomycin, and triclosan showed IC50 values of 1.0 ± 0.3, 17.3 ± 3.2, and 0.06 ± 0.02 μg/ml, respectively (Fig. 5A). Using B. subtilis FASII enzymes, IC50 values of 0.10 ± 0.03, 110 ± 35, and 0.8 ± 0.4 μg/ml were obtained for cerulenin, thiolactomycin, and triclosan, respectively (Fig. 5B). S. aureus enzymes revealed IC50 values of 1.5 ± 0.4 for cerulenin, 13.0 ± 3.9 for thiolactomycin, and 0.0079 ± 0.002 μg/ml for triclosan (Fig. 5C). Experiments were performed in duplicate or triplicate at least three times. Screening, Isolation, and Characterization of New Inhibitors—Using the FASII assay, we screened both natural product extracts and a collection of synthetic compounds (not shown). The assay performed adequately to identify inhibitors of fatty acid synthesis for enzymes involved in chain elongation. The hit rate was 0.13%, and the Z′ factor (32Zhang J-H. Chung T.D.Y. Oldenburg K.R. J. Biomol. Screening. 1999; 4: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (5151) Google Scholar) was 0.73. From actinomycete active broth S18 (Fig. 6), we isolated a new compound, BABX (Fig. 7A), which accounted for the FASII inhibitory activity of the extract. The details of isolation and structure elucidation will be published elsewhere. BABX inhibited fatty acid synthesis, giving IC50 values of 11.4 and 35.3 μg/ml in the S. aureus and E. coli FASII assays, respectively (Fig. 7B). BABX exhibited good antibacterial activities against S. aureus (MIC = 0.2 μg/ml) and poor antibacterial activities against wild type E. coli (MIC > 250 μg/ml). To determine the reason for the failure of this compound to reach its intracellular target in E. coli, we generated permeable E. coli (lpxC) and/or efflux-negative E. coli (tolC) strains (Table I). This compound was tested against these strains, and MIC values were determined. It showed MIC values of 0.24, >250, and 0.39 μg/ml against E. coli (lpxC), E. coli (tolC), and E. coli (lpxC and tolC), respectively (Table II). Similar results were also observed in the Kirby-Bauer assay (Fig. 7D). In the whole cell labeling assay, BABX inhibited S. aureus phospholipid synthesis with an IC50 value of 0.21 μg/ml. However, it also inhibited DNA, RNA, protein, and cell wall syntheses with similar IC50 values of 0.2–0.3 μg/ml. Due to the lack of penetration of BABX in E. coli, the whole cell labeling assay was carried out using E. coli (lpxC), showing 51%, 35%, 34%, 8%, and no inhibition of phospholipids synthesis, DNA synthesis, protein synthesis, RNA synthesis, and cell wall synthesis at 100 μg/ml, respectively (Table II). To determine the possible target of BABX, the FASII elongation assay was performed. When acetyl-CoA, a natural substrate, was used, it produced longer chains of acyl-ACP but weaker signals in S. aureus compared with E. coli (Fig. 7, lanes 2 and 10). However, when we used n-octanoyl-CoA, a substrate used in the FASII assay, as a substrate, it produced better signals compared with acetyl-CoA in S. aureus (Fig. 7, lanes 2 and 7). As a result, it afforded a better signal to background window that helped in the screening of natural product extracts against S. aureus enzymes. At 200 μg/ml, BABX completely blocked fatty acid elongation (Fig. 7, lanes 4 and 8) similar to that of cerulenin, unlike triclosan where an extra band can be seen (Fig. 7, lane 9). BABX did not inhibit the FabD reaction which catalyzes malonyl-CoA and holo-ACP to malonyl-ACP (Fig. 7C, lanes 1, 4, and 8).Table IIBiological activity of fatty acid synthesis inhibitorsOrganismAssayE. coliS. aureusMB4827 (wild type)MB4902 (lpxC)MB5747 (tolC)MB5746 (lpxC, tolC)MB2985 (wild type)μg/mlRifampicinMIC50.0052.50.0050.0008NovobiocinMIC200500.80.40.05ErythromycinMIC2503.91.00.250.25CeruleninFASII (IC50)1.01.251.00.751.5MIC100503.13.164PL labeling (IC50)aPL labeling (IC50): IC50 of whole cell phospholipid labeling with 1 μCi/ml 2-[3H]glycerol70.115.910.03.5512.5DNA labeling (IC50)bDNA labeling (IC50): IC50 of whole cell labeling with 1 μCi/ml 6-[3H]thymidine.

Thus it is important to track their accumulation in cells by measuring their ability to specifically inhibit the target pathway (phospholipid synthesis, in this case) and cell growth as well as their enzyme inhibitory activity. The effects of cerulenin, thiolactomycin, and triclosan on macromolecular synthesis and MIC were examined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All three compounds selectively inhibited phospholipid synthesis. The IC50 values of whole cell labeling for RNA, protein, and cell wall syntheses (data not shown) were similar to those of DNA synthesis. The results of MICs, whole cell labeling and IC50 values in the FASII assay against E. coli (wild type), E. coli (lpxC), E. coli (tolC), E. coli (lpxC and tolC), and S. aureus are summarized in Table II. Rifampicin is a typical positive control against permeable Gram-negative bacteria. Novobiocin is a positive control substrate of the AcrA/B TolC efflux pump of E. coli. Erythromycin is subject to both the outer membrane barrier and efflux. The MIC results against the E. coli strains indicated that efflux played the primary role in modulating accumulation of the three compounds. In contrast, BABX had permeability characteristics similar to rifampicin, where TolC mediated efflux did not play a role. Acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA have been used as substrates for the in vitro fatty acid synthesis assay for decades. Acetyl-CoA and malonyl-ACP are condensed by FabH to make acetoacetyl-ACP, which initiates the fatty acid elongation cycle. However, E. coli and S. aureus FabH can utilize short (up to six carbons) fatty acid chains as a substrate (22He X. Reynolds K.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 1310-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 33Jackowski S. Rock C. J. Biol.

In adipose tissue, excessive cortisol production through 11β-HSD1 activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of type II diabetes and obesity. We report here biophysical, kinetic, mutagenesis, and structural data on two ternary complexes of 11β-HSD1. The combined results reveal flexible active site interactions relevant to glucocorticoid recognition and demonstrate how four 11β-HSD1 C termini converge to form an as yet uncharacterized tetramerization motif. A C-terminal Pro-Cys motif is localized at the center of the tetramer and forms reversible enzyme disulfides that alter enzyme activity. Conformational flexibility at the tetramerization interface is coupled to structural changes at the enzyme active site suggesting how the central Pro-Cys motif may regulate enzyme activity.

Obesity is an urgent and growing health problem (1Lemonick M.D. Time. 2004; 163: 57-71Google Scholar). Because of excessive caloric intake, improper nutrition, and inadequate physical activity, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention has stated that obesity has risen at an epidemic rate during the past 20 years and appears to be worsening (www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/obesity). At present, 1 in 4 Americans is clinically obese and often displays symptoms of a condition called the metabolic syndrome (2Zimmet P. Alberti K.G. Shaw J. Nature. 2001; 414: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (4595) Google Scholar). Some of these symptoms include congestive heart failure, abdominal obesity, atherogenic dyslipidemia, hypertension, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and type II diabetes. Recent advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms relevant to the metabolic syndrome suggest that tissue-specific increases in cortisol levels through the action of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity (11β-HSD) 1The abbreviations used are: 11β-HSD, 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type I; SDR, short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propane sulfonate; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; RMS, root mean-squared; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. could contribute to the pathogenesis of this prevalent disease (3Engeli S.

In humans, two 11β-HSD isoforms mediate the interconversion of cortisone (inactive glucocorticoid) and cortisol (active glucocorticoid). 11β-HSD type 1 (11β-HSD1) is highly expressed in key metabolic tissues including liver, adipose tissue, and the central nervous system (7Stewart P.M.

Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1371-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). 11β-HSD type 2 (11β-HSD2) is an NAD+-dependent dehydrogenase that is expressed in aldosterone-selective tissues (11Agarwal A.K.

In these tissues, 11β-HSD2 oxidizes cortisol to cortisone and prevents illicit activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor. 11β-HSD1 belongs to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family of enzymes, of which over 60 members are found in humans (14Oppermann U.

SDRs are reversible NAD(H)/NADP(H)-dependent oxidoreductases containing a structurally conserved α/β nucleotide-binding Rossman fold. Within the core structure, two conserved motifs are shared among all SDR enzymes (18Filling C. Berndt K.D. Benach J. Knapp S. Prozorovski T. Nordling E. Ladenstein R. Jornvall H. Oppermann U. J.

A dinucleotide-binding P-loop forms a turn between a β-strand and an α-helix and directly contacts the ribose sugar and pyrophosphate. A Tyr-X-X-X-Lys motif, often in concert with a conserved Ser that orients substrate, catalyzes proton transfer to and from reduced and oxidized reaction intermediates. A flexible region in SDR enzymes, that often changes conformation upon substrate binding to shield the active site from bulk solvent, mediates enzyme specificity (19Powell A.J. Read J.A.

SDR oligomerization and intracellular localization is often mediated by extensions at the N and C termini. 11β-HSD1 is a NADPH-dependent enzyme that functions predominantly as a reductase in vivo. In cells, a single N-terminal transmembrane helix and associated linker anchors the C-terminal catalytic domain within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (24Odermatt A. Arnold P. Stauffer A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 2305-2312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A growing body of evidence suggests that in the ER 11β-HSD1 colocalizes with NADPH-generating hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PDH), an enzyme that has been genetically linked to cortisone reductase deficiency in people (26Draper N. Walker E.A. Bujalska I.J. Tomlinson J.W. Chalder S.M. Arlt W. Lavery G.G. Bedendo O. Ray D.W. Laing I. Malunowicz E. White P.C. Hewison M. Mason P.J. Connell J.M. Shackleton C.H. Stewart P.M. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 434-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Based on these results, it has been proposed that the 11β-HSD1 reductase activity predominates in metabolic tissues because of an increased NADPH/NADP+ ratio within the ER lumen and/or through direct interactions with H6PDH. On the basis of in vitro assays, it has been suggested that 11β-HSD1 is dimeric, has cooperative enzyme kinetics, and that a C-terminal, primate-specific cysteine residue (Cys272) forms reversible inter-subunit disulfides (27Walker E.A.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2459-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In contrast to what is observed in vivo, the reductase activity of 11β-HSD1 is unstable in cell homogenates despite high levels of NADPH (28Jamieson P.M. Walker B.R. Chapman K.E. Andrew R. Rossiter S. Seckl J.R. J. Endocrinol. 2000; 165: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These results strongly argue that enzyme localization to the ER membrane, and/or post-translational modifications are important for dictating enzyme activity and directionality. Biochemical, genetic, and clinical data all suggest that selective inhibition of 11β-HSD1 may offer a therapeutic approach for treating metabolic syndrome and other diseases. In mice, adipose-specific overexpression of 11β-HSD1 leads to the development of visceral obesity, insulin-resistant diabetes, and hyperlipidemia (29Masuzaki H. Paterson J. Shinyama H. Morton N.M. Mullins J.J. Seckl J.R. Flier J.S. Science. 2001; 294: 2166-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). In contrast, 11β-HSD1 knockout mice fed high fat diets have low intracellular glucocorticoid levels and are protected from obesity, diabetes, and dyslipidemia (30Morton N.M. Paterson J.M. Masuzaki H.

Further validation of 11β-HSD1 as a therapeutic target comes from experiments that show mice that are exposed to a selective 11β-HSD1 inhibitor have enhanced hepatic insulin sensitivity and lower blood glucose levels (33Alberts P.

Consistent with results from 11β-HSD1 knockout mice showing protection from age-induced glucocorticoid-associated hippocampal dysfunction (35Yau J.L. Noble J. Kenyon C.J. Hibberd C. Kotelevtsev Y. Mullins J.J. Seckl J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Yau J.L. MacLullich A.M. Noble J. Deary I.J. Walker B.R. Seckl J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; PubMed Google Scholar). The development of new 11β-HSD1 inhibitors would clearly benefit from an understanding of the enzyme structural features that mediate substrate and inhibitor binding. Here, we present two high resolution crystal structures of 11β-HSD1 in complex with co-substrate NADP+ and the steroidal detergent molecule CHAPS. When combined with biochemical results, the structural results provide an informed basis for understanding cofactor and glucocorticoid recognition and reveal how four 11β-HSD1 C termini converge to form a tetramerization motif that has not yet been characterized in others proteins. The tetramerization interface is highly malleable and changes conformation to alter the arrangement of active site residues appropriately positioned to modulate substrate binding and product release. Together, these results define the structural basis for 11β-HSD1 enzyme activity and will ultimately aid in the design of therapeutics that have the potential to treat human diseases such as type II diabetes and obesity. Cloning and Expression—The 11β-HSD1 gene was amplified from IMAGE clone 5193867 (ATCC clone 7277078), using PCR with the primers 5′-AACGAGGAATTCAGACCAGAGATG-3′ and 5′-TTACTT-GTTTATGAATCTGTCCAT-3′. The resulting PCR product was Topo-cloned into a modified pBAD-ThioE vector (Invitrogen). The final construct contains the coding sequence for the catalytic domain of 11β-HSD1 (residues 24–292) preceded by a MKHQHQHQHQHQHQQPL affinity tag. A single point mutation, C272S, as well as a C-terminal truncation (residues 264–292) were constructed from this plasmid using QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene). Recombinant 11β-HSD1 was expressed in Escherichia coli DH10b-Tir cells (Invitrogen) grown overnight at 37 °C, in Luria broth (LB) supplemented to 0.05 mg/ml kanamycin and induced with 0.2% arabinose and 0.25 mm corticosterone. 11β-HSD1 was purified from frozen cell pellets that were thawed and resuspended in lysis buffer (30 mm CHAPS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.5 μl/ml benzonase, 1 μl/ml ReadyLyse), incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and then clarified by centrifugation. The resulting supernatant was loaded on Probond resin (Invitrogen), previously equilibrated with wash buffer (4 mm CHAPS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.25 m NaCl, 40 mm imidazole), and then washed with 10 column volumes of wash buffer. 11β-HSD1 was eluted with 3 column volumes of wash buffer supplemented to 0.2 m imidazole. The eluate was extensively dialyzed against 4 mm CHAPS, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.25 m NaCl, concentrated to 10 mg/ml, and flash-frozen in 50-μl aliquots for long term storage. Crystallization and Structure Solution—Two crystal forms of C272S 11β-HSD1 were identified using Nanovolume Crystallization™ methods (37Hosfield D. Palan J. Hilgers M. Scheibe D. McRee D.E. Stevens R.C. J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 142: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and reproduced in larger volumes with a reservoir containing 20% polyethylene glycol 3350 and 100 mm MES buffer, pH 6.2. A single site lutetium derivative was obtained by soaking these crystals for 72 h in reservoir solution containing 1 mm lutetium acetate. Crystals were harvested in reservoir solutions supplemented with 20% ethylene glycol, and flash frozen by direct immersion in liquid nitrogen. For the two native crystals, x-ray diffraction data extending to 1.55 and 1.80 Å resolution were collected at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) Beam Line 5.0.3 using a wavelength of 1.00 Å. Both crystal forms of 11β-HSD1 belong to the monoclinic space group P21 and have four monomers in the asymmetric unit. For the lutetium-derivatized crystal, 4 data sets extending to 2.20 Å resolution were collected at ALS Beam Line 5.0.2 using wavelengths of 1.2782, 1.3404, 1.3408, and 1.3412 Å. All data were integrated and scaled using HKL2000 (38Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Met. Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The position of the lutetium atom in the crystallographic asymmetric unit was determined by SHELXD (39Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar), and MAD phases were calculated with SHARP (40La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Met. Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). The initial lutetium-bound structure was built manually using the program Xfit (41McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar) and refined without non-crystallographic symmetry restraints in REFMAC (42Winn M.D. Murshudov G.N. Papiz M.Z. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 300-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Phases for the two high resolution native structures were obtained by molecular replacement using the program MOLREP, and then improved with Arp/Warp (43Morris R.J. Perrakis A. Lamzin V.S. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 229-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) as implemented in CCP4 version 4.0. Iterative cycles of manual model building with Xfit and refinement in REFMAC gave the final refined models. In one of the ternary complexes, electron density consistent with two non-active site steroid molecules was found at the interface between two enzyme dimers. Because of presumed mobility, we could not unambiguously determine the identity of the steroid and thus modeled them as the steroid nucleus of CHAPS.

Open table in a new tab Enzyme Kinetics—The dehydrogenase activity of 11β-HSD1 was measured by incubating 50 nm enzyme with varying amounts of NADP+ (0.2–200 μm) and cortisol (0.2–200 μm) for 60 min in buffer consisting of 50 mm TRIS pH7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.01% Brij35. NADPH production was monitored by measuring fluorescence emission at 460 nm (excitation at 340 nm) using a Molecular Devices SpectraMax Gemini XS fluorescent plate reader. Calibration curves showed a linear increase in fluorescence intensity with increasing NADPH concentration up to 100 μm under these conditions. A disulfide-linked form of wild-type 11β-HSD1 was generated by incubating enzyme (300 μm) with 1 mm K3Fe(CN)6 for 2 h at room temperature followed by dialysis to remove excess oxidizing agent. Biophysical and Kinetic Characterization of Recombinant 11β-HSD1—To determine the oligomeric solution structure of our recombinantly expressed truncated forms of wild-type (residues 24–292) and C272S 11β-HSD1 enzymes we used static light scattering (SLS) at an enzyme concentration of ∼100 μm. The SLS data gave mondisperse molecular masses of 139,106 Da and 136,615 Da for the wild-type and C272S enzymes, respectively. As the theoretical molecular mass of an 11β-HSD1 subunit is ∼32,000 Da, these results support tetrameric assembly of enzyme subunits to form the functional enzyme. Since SDR enzymes often form tetramers through complementary interactions of residues C-terminal to the catalytic core, we also determined the molecular mass of a C-terminally truncated enzyme missing the last 28 residues (residues 24–264). The SLS data for this truncated enzyme gave an apparent molecular mass of 63,588 Da. This result is consistent with the truncated enzyme forming dimers in solution and verifies that the enzyme C terminus mediates tetramer assembly. We further explored the possibility of forming enzyme disulfides by oxidizing the wild-type enzyme with K3Fe(CN)6. Using mass spectrometry we verified that this procedure generates a mixture of 31,807 Da monomers and 63,615 Da disulfide-linked dimers (Fig. 1a). This disulfide-linked form of the enzyme was rapidly eliminated by the addition of 1 mm dithiothreitol (Fig. 1a). K3Fe(CN)6 addition to the C272S enzyme did not catalyze disulfide bond formation (not shown) indicating Cys272 mediates intermolecular disulfide formation in the wild-type enzyme. The dehydrogenase activity of the Cys272 disulfide-linked, the Cys272 sulfhydryl, and the C-terminally truncated forms of 11β-HSD1 was determined using a fluorescence assay that measures the rate of formation of NADPH. Upon oxidation, the enzyme showed a 2-fold increase in kcat that was coupled to a 4-fold increase in Km for substrate, resulting in a net 2-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) for cortisol oxidation (Fig. 1b). The C-terminally truncated enzyme showed almost identical activity to the Cys272 sulfhydryl form of the enzyme (data not shown). These results, when combined with our mass spectrometry data, reveal that while the enzyme C terminus is not crucial for catalysis, intermolecular Cys272 disulfide bond formation must significantly alter its structure to affect the substrate-binding and catalytic properties of the enzyme. Subunit Structures and Topology of 11β-HSD1—Two crystal forms of 11β-HSD1 grown using identical crystallization reagents were identified while screening heavy atom derivatives. Both crystal forms, constructed from what we herein term “interface-open” and “interface-closed” conformations of the enzyme, belong to similar P21 space groups although the b-axis is ∼7-Å longer in the interface-open crystals (Table I). We used the MAD phases derived from the lutetium-derivatized enzyme to solve the structure of both crystal forms. The interface-open structure was solved to a resolution of 1.55 Å and the interface-closed structure was solved to a resolution of 1.80 Å. The overall Rossman fold topology of 11β-HSD1 resembles other SDR enzymes in which a central 6-stranded, all-parallel β-sheet is sandwiched on both sides by 3 α-helices (Fig. 2a). A conformationally variable β6-α6 insertion that forms one wall of the steroid binding pocket, an additional β-strand (β7) and two C-terminal α-helices (αE and αF) are appended to the core structure and complete the 11β-HSD1 fold. Aside from large differences in their quaternary structures, (see below) the eight 11β-HSD1 subunits in the two crystal forms, including bound cofactor and detergent are similar, with 0.21 Å2 root mean square (RMS) deviations for all aligned Cα atoms. In the structures, each active site shows well defined electron density for the cofactor NADP+ and the steroidal detergent CHAPS (Fig. 2b). Cofactor Binding—NADP+ binding to 11β-HSD1 is similar to other SDR enzymes, with the molecule binding in an extended conformation in which both ribose sugars adopt a C2-endo conformation (Fig. 2c). Because of the exceptionally high quality of the experimental electron density in both ternary complexes (Fig. 2, b and c), we could accurately measure the C2N-C3N-C7N-O7N torsion angle. This torsion angle, which defines the planarity of the cofactor carboxamide relative to its attached pyridine ring is indicative of the redox state of the cofactor (22Tanaka N. Nonaka T. Tanabe T. Yoshimoto T. Tsuru D. Mitsui Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7715-7730Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In each 11β-HSD1 subunit, this angle is very close to 180°, indicating that oxidized NADP+, rather than NADPH is present in the crystal. The adenine and nicotinamide rings are both well ordered and bind roughly perpendicular to the plane of the ribose sugars with the adenine adopting an anti configuration and the nicotinamide adopting a syn configuration. The adenosine moiety lies in a cleft formed by 4 loops (β1/α1, β2/α2, β3/α3, and β4/α4) and an α-helix (α4). Direct hydrogen bonds between adenines N-1 and extracyclic N-6 atoms, with Thr92 Oγ and Met93 NH, as well as stacking interactions with Arg66 on one side and packing interactions with His120 on the other, mediate purine binding. The ribose sugar sits above the backbone of the first P-loop Gly (Gly41) and is secured to the protein by packing interactions with Lys44 and a hydrogen bond between its 3′-OH and Ser43 Oγ. 11β-HSD1 specificity for NADP+ over NAD+ is mostly mediated through an electrostatic interaction between the ribose 2′-phosphate and the guanidinium Nϵ and Nζ atoms of Arg66. Additional contacts to the ribose 2′-phosphate by the backbone amides of Arg66 and Ser67, Ser67 Oγ, as well as protein-ligated water molecules, further anchor the NADP+ to the enzyme. The negatively charged pyrophosphate binds at the N terminus of α1 and makes direct interactions with the backbone amide of Ile46. The NADP+ ribityl nicotinamide is bound at the enzyme active site and conserved SDR residue Lys187 ligates the 2′- and 3′-ribose hydroxyls (Figs. 1b and 2a). Consistent with recent biochemical and structural results on 3β,17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (18Filling C. Berndt K.D. Benach J. Knapp S. Prozorovski T. Nordling E. Ladenstein R. Jornvall H. Oppermann U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25677-25684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), the Asn143 backbone carbonyl ligates a conserved water that functions as part of a proton relay system with bulk solvent. The oxidized nicotinamide ring is maintained in a syn orientation relative to the ribose by three hydrogen bonds between the carboxamide side chain with the backbone atoms of Ile218 and an oxygen atom of the NADP+ pyrophosphate (Fig. 2c). Steroid Binding Pocket—In both 11β-HSD1 ternary complexes the steroidal core of the bound detergent is well ordered and in identical conformations in each of the 8 independent copies of the two different crystallographic asymmetric units. The steroid A ring is positioned at the catalytic end of the substrate binding cleft and the zwitterionic tail of the detergent extends toward solvent through a channel formed by residues of the flexible substrate-binding region and the C terminus of two adjacent subunits (Fig. 2, a and d). The three α-directed steroidal hydroxyl groups of CHAPS all form bifurcated hydrogen bonds with protein and cofactor atoms in the ternary complexes. The 12-hydroxyl interacts with an active-site water molecule and the oxygen atom of the NADP+ carboxamide. The cis-trans AB ring conformation orients the A-ring C-3 hydroxyl to deeply penetrate the catalytic cleft where it interacts with two NADP+ pyrophosphate oxygens. The C-6 hydroxyl hydrogen bonds to an active site water molecule and the oxygen atom of Tyr183 from the catalytic Tyr-X-X-X-Lys motif. With the exception of these hydrophilic contacts, the rest of the steroid-binding pocket is exclusively hydrophobic. Residues Ile121, Thr124, and Leu126 from the β4-α4 loop, Val180 from the β5-α5 loop, and Thr222, Ala226, and Val227 from αC form the protein surface in close vicinity to the β-face of the steroid. The NADP+ nicotinamide and the β6-αD loop residues Leu215, Gly216, and Lys217 are within van der Waals contact distance of the α-face of the steroid, whereas β5-α5 residues Ala172 and Tyr177, α5 residue Tyr183, β6 residue Leu217 and αC residue Ala223 make edge-on interactions. Crystal structures and biochemical studies of other SDR enzymes have established that substrate binding induces an ordering of the nonconserved and conformationally variable β6-α6 insert to provide enzyme specificity and protect the active site from bulk solvent to promote hydride transfer (14Oppermann U. Filling C. Hult M. Shafqat N. Wu X. Lindh M. Shafqat J. Nordling E. Kallberg Y. Persson B. Jornvall H. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2003; 143–144: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (54"
https://openalex.org/W1985860073,"Lipoproteins in Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae carry three fatty acids on the N-terminal cysteine residue, two as a diacylglyceride and one through an N-linkage following signal peptide cleavage. Most lipoproteins are anchored in the outer membrane, facing the periplasm, but some lipoproteins remain in the plasma membrane, depending on the amino acid at position +2, immediately after the fatty-acylated cysteine. In vitro, the last step in lipoprotein maturation, N-acylation of apolipoproteins by the plasma membrane apolipoprotein N-acyltransferase (Lnt), is necessary for efficient recognition of outer membrane lipoproteins by the Lol system, which transports them from the plasma to the outer membrane (Fukuda, A., Matsuyama, S.-I., Hara, T., Nakayama, J., Nagasawa, H., and Tokuda, H. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 43512–43518). To study the role of Lnt in vivo, we constructed a conditional lnt mutant of Escherichia coli. The apo-form of peptidoglycan-anchored major lipoprotein (Lpp) and two other outer membrane lipoproteins accumulated in the plasma membrane when lnt expression was reduced. We also found that Lnt is an essential protein in E. coli and that the lethality is partially because of the retention of apoLpp in the plasma membrane. Topology mapping of Lnt with β-galactosidase and alkaline phosphatase fusions indicated the presence of six membrane-spanning segments. The lnt gene in a mutant of Salmonella enterica displaying thermosensitive Lnt activity (Gupta, S. D., Gan, K., Schmid, M. B., and Wu, H. C. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 16551–16556) was found to carry a mutation causing a single glutamate to lysine substitution at a highly conserved position in the last predicted periplasmic loop of the protein.

The Escherichia coli K12 genome encodes almost a hundred putative lipoproteins (1Madan Babu M. Sankaran K. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), a unique class of exported proteins, most of which are anchored in the inner leaflet of the outer membrane by their N-terminal fatty acids (2Ichihara S. Hussain M. Mizushima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3125-3129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The best characterized lipoprotein, Lpp, is present in two forms in the outer membrane. Approximately one-third of the Lpp molecules in the cell are cross-linked to the peptidoglycan via the C-terminal lysine residue (3Braun V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 415: 335-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), thereby contributing to outer membrane integrity (4Hirota Y. Suzuki H. Nishimura Y. Yasuda S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 1417-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The remainder of the Lpp exists as a free (unbound) form. Lpp has been extensively used to study bacterial lipoprotein biogenesis and sorting to the outer membrane. Three fatty acids are bound to its N-terminal cysteine residue, two in a diacylglyceride that is linked via a thioether bond to the sulfhydryl group and one to the amine group that is liberated upon signal peptide cleavage (5Hantke K. Braun V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 34: 284-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 6Wu H.C. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss R. II I Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M.

The fully matured lipoprotein is then transferred from the plasma membrane to the periplasmic lipoprotein chaperone LolA (7Matsuyama S. Tajima T. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3365-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) by the ABC transporter LolCDE (8Yakushi T. Masuda K. Narita S-I. Matsuyama S.-I. Tokuda H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), and then delivered to the outer membrane docking protein LolB (9Matsuyama S. Yokota N. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6947-6955Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), whereupon it inserts into the inner lipid leaflet of the outer membrane. It seems reasonable to assume that most if not all E. coli outer membrane lipoproteins follow exactly the same route. A relatively small number of lipoproteins remain in the E. coli plasma membrane. In the two characterized plasma membrane lipoproteins, the endogenous protein NlpA (10Yamaguchi K. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3747-3749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the Klebsiella oxytoca amylolytic enzyme pullulanase (11Pugsley A.P. Kornacker M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13640-13645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), retention in the plasma membrane requires the aspartate residue at position +2, immediately after the fatty acylated cysteine. Furthermore, the introduction of an Asp+2 residue into outer membrane lipoproteins or its presence in artificial lipoproteins (formed by fusing the signal peptide and first few amino acids of a lipoprotein to a reporter protein) causes their retention in the plasma membrane (12Yamaguchi K. Yu F. Inouye M. Cell. 1988; 53: 423-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 13Seydel A. Gounon P. Pugsley A.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 810-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Other residues except proline and aromatic amino acids cause lipoproteins to be routed to the outer membrane (12Yamaguchi K. Yu F. Inouye M. Cell. 1988; 53: 423-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 13Seydel A. Gounon P. Pugsley A.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 810-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The ability of Asp+2 to cause efficient plasma membrane retention may be influenced both by amino acids in the adjacent sequence (14Gennity J.M. Kim H. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2095-2101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Terada M. Kuroda T. Matsuyama S-I. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47690-47694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and by the structure of the polypeptide of which it is part (16Robichon C. Bonhivers M. Pugsley A.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1145-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Asp+2 lipoproteins differ from outer membrane lipoproteins in being unable to activate the LolCDE ATPase in proteoliposomes, suggesting that Asp+2 functions as an Lol avoidance signal (8Yakushi T. Masuda K. Narita S-I. Matsuyama S.-I. Tokuda H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 17Masuda K. Matsuyama S-I. Tokuda H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Other details of the mechanism by which lipoproteins are retained in the plasma membrane are unclear. The unique physicochemical properties of aspartate seem to be important for this function (19Hara T. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 40408-40414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (57) Google Scholar), which makes it all the more surprising that the structurally unrelated aromatic amino acids and proline at position +2 in an artificial lipoprotein can also function as efficient plasma membrane retention signals (13Seydel A. Gounon P. Pugsley A.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 810-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has not been established whether Asp+2 functions as an Lol avoidance signal in other species of bacteria. The plasma membrane enzyme that carries out the third and final step in lipoprotein processing and acylation (apolipoprotein N-acyltransferase or Lnt) was first identified in E. coli (20Gupta S.D. Wu H.C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1991; 78: 37-42Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A gene (lnt) encoding this enzyme was subsequently identified by the same group in Salmonella enterica sv. Typhimurium through studies of a temperature-sensitive mutant in which apoLpp (lacking the N-acyl group) accumulated at the nonpermissive temperature (21Gupta S.D. Gan K. Schmid M.B. Wu H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16551-16556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lnt gene E. coli (initially called cutE and referred to here as lntEc to reflect its known function and to distinguish it from the S. enterica gene, lntSe) was independently identified in studies of a copper-sensitive mutant (22Rogers S.D. Bhave M.R. Mercer J.F.B. Camakaris J. Lee B.T.O. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6742-6748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence alignments reveal that homologues of Lnt are present in Gram-negative bacteria but apparently absent from most Gram-positive bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus (23Tjalsma H. Kontinen V.P. Pragai Z. Wu H. Meima R. Venema G. Bron S. Sarvas M. van Dijl J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1698-1707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 24Navarre W.W. Daefler S. Schneewind O. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 441-446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This observation led to the proposal that lipoproteins produced by Gram-positive bacteria might be incompletely fatty-acylated and, since all of them are retained in the plasma membrane, that N-acylation might be a characteristic of Gram-negative bacterial outer membrane lipoproteins (13Seydel A. Gounon P. Pugsley A.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 810-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 23Tjalsma H. Kontinen V.P. Pragai Z. Wu H. Meima R. Venema G. Bron S. Sarvas M. van Dijl J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1698-1707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In apparent agreement with this idea, LolCDE in proteoliposomes cannot promote the capture by LolA of the “apo-form” of another major E. coli outer membrane lipoprotein, Pal, suggesting that N-acylation is required for efficient recognition of nascent outer membrane lipoproteins by the Lol system (25Fukuda A.

However, mass spectrometry demonstrated that plasma membrane-anchored Lpp with an Asp+2 residue is fully N-acylated, indicating that this retention signal (or Lol avoidance signal) does not operate by preventing N-acylation (25Fukuda A. Matsuyama S-I. Hara T. Nakayama J. Nagasawa H. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43512-43518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Furthermore, analysis of E. coli Lpp produced in B. subtilis (26Hayashi S. Chang S.Y. Chang S. Giam C.Z. Wu H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5753-5759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and of BlaZ β-lactamase in S. aureus (24Navarre W.W. Daefler S. Schneewind O. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 441-446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that at least some polypeptides were N-acylated, indicating that these Gram-positive bacteria might possess an enzyme with a similar activity to Lnt. In apparent contrast to the aforementioned retention of apo-Pal in proteoliposomes in the presence of LolA, studies with S. enterica carrying a temperature-sensitive (ts) mutation in lnt (referred to here as lntts) revealed that apoLpp produced at the nonpermissive temperature (42 °C) was covalently bound to the peptidoglycan and could not be extracted from the membranes with the detergent Sarkosyl, suggesting that it was localized to the outer membrane (21Gupta S.D. Gan K. Schmid M.B. Wu H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16551-16556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This interpretation has been called into question (25Fukuda A. Matsuyama S-I. Hara T. Nakayama J. Nagasawa H. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43512-43518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), because it is known that Lpp that is artificially retained in the plasma membrane by introduction of Asp+2 is also cross-linked to the peptidoglycan, leading to cell death (27Yakushi T. Tajima T. Matsuyama S-I. Tokuda H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2857-2862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This report documents the effects of LntEc depletion in E. coli on lipoprotein localization and membrane organization. We constructed a conditional lntEc mutant in which the chromosomal lntEc gene is exclusively expressed from the tightly regulated arabinose-inducible araB promoter. This strategy avoids secondary effects introduced by the growth at high temperature that is necessary to inactivate the thermosensitive form of S. enterica Lnt (21Gupta S.D. Gan K. Schmid M.B. Wu H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16551-16556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The question of whether apoLpp is retained in the plasma membrane in vivo was then addressed by using a variant of this protein that cannot be cross-linked to the peptidoglycan (27Yakushi T. Tajima T. Matsuyama S-I. Tokuda H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2857-2862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strains, Plasmids, and Construction of para-lntEc Cassette—Strains of E. coli and S. enterica sv. Typhimurium used in this study are listed in Table I. Strain PAP8504 was constructed by homologous recombination according to the method developed by Datsenko and Wanner (28Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11293) Google Scholar). The kan-rpoCter-paraB cassette was constructed by successive ligations between DNA fragments encoding the rpoCter gene, the kan gene, or the araB promoter. First, the terminator rpoCter was excised from pOM90 (29Richet E. Søgaard-Andersen L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4558-4567Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) using restriction enzymes EcoRI and KpnI and cloned in the plasmid pGP704 (30Miller V.L. Mekalanos J.J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2575-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar), at the same sites, giving pCHAP6560. Second, the gene encoding kanamycin phosphotransferase (kan) was PCR-amplified using primers 5′-kan and kan-3′ (Table III) from pBGS18 (31Spratt B.G. te Hedge P.J. Heesen S. Edelman A. Broome-Smith J.K. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 41: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The fragment was cloned into EcoRI and NotI sites upstream from the rpoCter gene in pCHAP6560 to create pCHAP6561. Finally, the araB promoter was PCR-amplified using primers 5′-para and para-3′ (Table III) from pBAD33 (32Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3978) Google Scholar), and the fragment was cloned into XbaI and SalI sites downstream rpoCter gene in pCHAP6561 to create pCHAP6563. E. coli strain BW25113 carrying pKD46 was electroporated with 50 ng of the kan-rpoCter-paraB fragment PCR-amplified from pCHAP6563 using primers 5′-ybe-k and p-lntEc-3′ (Table III). These long primers include 45 nucleotides that hybridize with the ybeX or lntEc genes and 19 or 25 priming nucleotides. PAP8504 was obtained after selection of transformants on agar containing kanamycin (25 μg/ml) and 0.2% arabinose and was then incubated at 37 °C to eliminate the temperature-sensitive pKD46. The presence of the cassette in PAP8504 was verified by PCR amplification using primers 5′-ybe-k and p-lntEc-3′ and by transduction into E. coli strain PAP105 using phage P1 (33Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Transductants were selected on agar containing kanamycin (25 μg/ml) and 0.2% arabinose.Table IBacterial strainsStrainCharacteristicsSource/Ref.BW25113E. coli K-12 lacIq28Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L.

Open table in a new tab Plasmids encoding fatty-acylated variants of MalE (Table II) were derived from plasmids used in a previous study (13Seydel A. Gounon P. Pugsley A.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 810-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Briefly, PCRs using appropriate oligonucleotide primers were used to change the second amino acid of the mature part of the protein referred to as CD-MalE in Ref. 13Seydel A. Gounon P. Pugsley A.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 810-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar to Ala, Phe, Pro, Trp, and Tyr using pCHAP511 as the template (34Sauvonnet N. Poquet I. Pugsley A.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5238-5246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A hexahistine tag was added to the end of each of the six lipoMalE constructs by replacing the 3′ BglII-HindIII fragment at the 3′ end of the malE gene by the corresponding segment of the malE::His6 gene carried by pMalE-His (provided by A. Davidson). The entire fragment was then subcloned as an EcoRI-HindIII fragment into pSU18 (35Bartolomé B. Jubete Y. de la Martinez E. Cruz F. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 102: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) or pBGS18+ (31Spratt B.G. te Hedge P.J. Heesen S. Edelman A. Broome-Smith J.K. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 41: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Details of other plasmids listed in Table II are given below. Growth Conditions—Liquid cultures were grown with aeration at 37 °C in LB medium (33Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar), and cultures on plates were grown at 37 °C on LB agar, both supplemented with 0.2% arabinose, 0.4% glucose, and/or 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) 1The abbreviation used is: IPTG, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. when necessary and with appropriate antibiotics (100 μg/ml ampicillin, 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 50 μg/ml kanamycin). For growth analysis and preparation of cell extracts, PAP8504 and PAP8505 were grown overnight in LB medium with 0.2% arabinose and washed in LB medium before being diluted 1:100 into LB medium with 0.2% arabinose or 0.4% glucose. Cells were grown at 37 °C with agitation to A600 0.8 and then re-diluted 1:10 of fresh medium. Immunoprecipitation of apoLpp—For radiolabeling, cells were grown exponentially in LB medium as above, washed, and resuspended in minimal medium supplemented with 0.4% glucose or 0.5% glycerol (when cells were grown in medium containing arabinose) for 15 min at 30 °C. Proteins from 1 ml of each culture were labeled with 50 μCi of [35S]methionine for 5 min at 30 °C and then precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. Precipitated proteins were dissolved and immunoprecipitated with anti-Lpp (provided by H. Tokuda), according to Ref. 36Kumamoto C.A. Gannon P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11554-11558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, resuspended in 50 μl of SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by urea SDS-PAGE. Construction and Analysis of lntEc-lacZ and lntEc-phoA Gene Fusions—The phoA gene encoding alkaline phosphatase, PhoA, lacking the region coding for the signal peptide (from amino acid +13) was PCR-amplified from plasmid pCHAP4020, 2O. Francetic, unpublished observations. using primers 5′-phoA and phoA-3′ (Table III), and cloned into PstI and HindIII sites in pBAD33 to obtain pCHAP6578. This plasmid was used to construct 9 plasmids, pCHAP6580 to pCHAP6588 (Table II), encoding LntEc(30)-PhoA to LntEc(512)-PhoA (numbers in parentheses correspond to the amino acid fusion site in LntEc). Each DNA fragment, obtained by PCR amplification with primers 5′-lntEc and lntEc30–3′ (or lntEc53–3′, lntEc80–3′, lntEc117–3′, lntEc154–3′, lntEc190–3′, lntEc218–3′, lntEc476–3′, and lntEc513–3′ (Table III)), was inserted into the XbaI and PstI sites in pCHAP6578. The same procedure was employed to construct the 9 plasmids, pCHAP6589 to pCHAP6597, encoding LntEc(30)-LacZ to LntEc(512)-LacZ. First, the lacZ gene encoding β-galactosidase, LacZ (from amino acid +9), was PCR-amplified from plasmid pRS552 (37Simons R.W. Houman F. Kleckner N. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 53: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar) using primers 5′-lacZ and lacZ-3′ (Table III) and cloned into the PstI and HindIII sites in pBAD33 to obtain pCHAP6577. An lntEc DNA fragment obtained by PCR amplification with primers 5′-lntEc and one of the nine 3′ primers lntEc30–3′ to lntEc512–3′ (Table III) was inserted into the XbaI and PstI sites in pCHAP6577. Derivatives of strain KS272 producing the LntEc-PhoA and LntEc-LacZ chimeras or carrying pCHAP6577 or pCHAP6578 as controls were grown in LB medium at 30 °C supplemented with chloramphenicol and arabinose. To measure alkaline phosphatase activity, cells were diluted in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) and then permeabilized by adding 50 μl of 10% octylpolyoxyethylene. After incubation at 37 °C for 5 min, the reaction was started by adding 100 μl of para-nitrophenyl phosphate (10 mg/ml) and stopped with 500 μl of 1 m NaOH. To measure β-galactosidase activity, the cells were diluted in Z-buffer (33Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) and permeabilized with octylpolyoxyethylene as above. The reaction was started by adding 200 μl of orthonitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside (4 mg/ml) and stopped by adding 500 μl of 1 m Na2CO3. Enzyme activities were calculated according to Miller (33Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) and are given in arbitrary units. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Proteins solubilized in loading buffer were heated at 100 °C for 5 min and separated by SDS-PAGE in gels containing 9, 10, or 12% acrylamide and, in some cases, 8 m urea to improve separation of apolipoproteins. Proteins were detected by staining with Coomassie Blue or after transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes and incubation with primary polyclonal antisera to Lpp, SecG (provided by W. Wickner), Pal (provided by E. Bouveret), NlpD (provided by S. Clarke), FhuA (provided by M. Bonhivers), β-galactosidase (Cappel), or alkaline phosphatase, and then by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antiserum (Amersham Biosciences). His-tagged proteins were immunodetected using INDIA HisProbe-horseradish peroxidase (Pierce). Bound horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibodies were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Separation of Plasma and Outer Membranes by Sucrose Flotation Gradient—One hundred ml of cultures at an A600 of 0.8–1.0 were collected by centrifugation, and the pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Cells were disrupted by two passages through a French press (1,200 bar), and the lysate was supplemented with 10 μg/ml each of DNase I and pancreatic RNase A and then centrifuged for 10 min at 4,000 rpm to eliminate unbroken cells. Membranes were then collected by ultracentrifugation at 160,000"
https://openalex.org/W2163547227,"The pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) plays a central role in inflammatory disorders. Transmembrane TNF-alpha and its two receptors are cleaved by the proteinase TNF-alpha converting enzyme (TACE), resulting in appreciable serum levels of soluble TNF-alpha and soluble TNF-alpha receptors (sTNFR1 and -2). The only known functions of sTNFR1 are to antagonize and buffer circulating TNF-alpha. Here, we present evidence that sTNFR1 exerts immunoregulatory functions by induction of apoptosis in monocytes through reverse signaling via transmembrane TNF-alpha. sTNFR1-induced apoptosis is independent of death receptor pathways but depends on autocrine transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 signaling through the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38alpha. This novel mechanism has implications for understanding the physiological role of sTNFR1 and for TNF-alpha-blocking therapies of autoimmune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1981662446,"The emergence of the seed habit in the Middle Paleozoic was a decisive evolutionary breakthrough. Today, seed plants are the most successful plant lineage, with more than 250,000 living species. We have identified a middle Givetian (385 million years ago) seed precursor from Belgium predating the earliest seeds by about 20 million years. Runcaria is a small, radially symmetrical, integumented megasporangium surrounded by a cupule. The megasporangium bears an unopened distal extension protruding above the multilobed integument. This extension is assumed to be involved in anemophilous pollination. Runcaria sheds new light on the sequence of character acquisition leading to the seed."
https://openalex.org/W2059935911,"Parathyroid hormone (PTH) plays a major role in bone remodeling and has the ability to increase bone mass if administered daily. In vitro, PTH inhibits the growth of osteoblastic cell lines, arresting them in G1 phase. Here, we demonstrate that PTH regulates the expression of at least three genes to achieve the following: inducing expression of MAPK phosphatase 1 (MKP-1) and p21Cip1 and decreasing expression of cyclin D1 at both mRNA and protein levels. The induction of MKP-1 causes the dephosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and therefore the decrease in cyclin D1. Overexpression of MKP-1 arrests UMR cells in G1 phase. The mechanisms involved in PTH regulation of these genes were studied. Most importantly, PTH administration produces similar effects on expression of these genes in rat femoral metaphyseal primary spongiosa. Analyses of p21Cip1 expression levels in bone indicate that repeated daily PTH injections make the osteoblast more sensitive to successive PTH treatments, and this might be an important feature for the anabolic functions of PTH. In summary, our data suggest that one mechanism for PTH to exert its anabolic effect is to arrest the cell cycle progression of the osteoblast and hence increase its differentiation.

In summary, our data suggest that one mechanism for PTH to exert its anabolic effect is to arrest the cell cycle progression of the osteoblast and hence increase its differentiation. The adult human skeleton is continuously resorbed and renewed by the actions of osteoclasts and osteoblasts. The maintenance of the skeleton requires the coordinated activities of these cells. Disruption of this coordination underlies many bone diseases, including osteoporosis. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) 1The abbreviations used are: PTH, parathyroid hormone; hPTH, human PTH; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MKP, MAPK phosphatase; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; CDKI, CDK inhibitor; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; RT, reverse transcription; EGFP-F, farnesylated enhanced green fluorescent protein; PKA, protein kinase A; PKC, protein kinase C; Rb, retinoblastoma protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase. is released by the parathyroid gland in response to slightly lowered serum ionized calcium concentrations and directly acts on the osteoblast but not the osteoclast. It plays a major role in the balance between bone formation and bone resorption. Although the physiological role of PTH is to mobilize calcium from bone into blood by stimulating bone resorption, current interest has focused on its ability to increase bone mass in humans when administered once daily. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this anabolic effect (for a review, see Ref. 1Qin L. Raggatt L.J. Partridge N.C. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 15: 60-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Among them, a prevailing hypothesis proposes that PTH promotes osteoblast differentiation. Osteoblasts originate from bone marrow stromal stem cells. These cells undergo proliferation and differentiation into preosteoblasts and then into a final stage of differentiation concomitant with extracellular matrix mineralization. These cells are considered to be terminally differentiated mature osteoblasts that must exit the cell cycle and end their differentiation as osteocytes embedded in a mineralized matrix. Therefore, arresting cell cycle progression of the osteoblast could be part of the mechanism elicited by PTH to facilitate differentiation.

However, a high PTH concentration (10-8 m) consistently inhibits the growth of several well established osteoblastic cell lines (UMR 106–01 (8Partridge N.C. Opie A.L. Opie R.T. Martin T.J. Calcif.

Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase-1 (MKP-1), originally named Erp/3CH134 or CL100, is a protein capable of regulating cell cycle progression. MKP-1 is an immediate early gene induced by growth factors and stress (11Charles C.H. Sun H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5292-5296Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 12Keyse S.M. Emslie E.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). It belongs to a family of dual specificity phosphatases capable of removing both phosphotyrosine and phosphothreonine from the Thr-X-Tyr motif, whose dual phosphorylation is critical for the activation of MAPKs (reviewed in Refs. 13Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar and 14Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Evidence strongly suggests that one of the MAPKs, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2, p42/p44MAPK), whose dual phosphorylation is connected to cell proliferation in most cell types, are substrates for MKP-1 (15Sun H.

In mammalian cells, the cell cycle is governed by the activities of the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and their regulatory cyclin partners. Progression from G1 to S phase requires cyclin D-Cdk4(6) and cyclin E-Cdk2. These complexes phosphorylate retinoblastoma protein (Rb), resulting in the dissociation of Rb and E2F. Released E2F is essential for cells to enter S phase. CDK inhibitors (CDKIs) are of two types: INK4 proteins interfere with cyclin D-Cdk4(6), and CIP/KIP members (p21Cip1, p27Kip1, and p57Kip2) bind to both complexes. Whereas it acts as an assembly factor for cyclin D-Cdk4(6), CIP/KIP inhibits the activity of cyclin E-Cdk2. Upon cell cycle arrest, the levels of CIP/KIP proteins increase, saturate D-type cyclins, and then bind to cyclin E-Cdk2 to block the catalytic activity of that kinase (20Coqueret O. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 65-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Previous studies demonstrated that 10-8 m PTH arrested UMR 106 cells, a rat osteoblastic osteosarcoma cell line, in G1 phase possibly by up-regulation of p27Kip1 (21Onishi T. Hruska K. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1995-2004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the detailed mechanism of how PTH inhibits cell cycle progression and the relationship between this feature and the anabolic effects that PTH has on bone are not fully understood. Here we report that PTH employs several mechanisms to inhibit cell cycle progression: inducing expression of MKP-1 and p21Cip1 and decreasing expression of cyclin D1. This is true not only in osteoblastic cells (UMR 106-01 and rat calvarial primary culture) but also in PTH-treated osteoblast-rich bone samples, suggesting that arresting osteoblastic cells in G1 could be an important part of the anabolic effect of PTH. Chemicals—Synthetic human PTH-(1–38), human PTH-(1–34), human PTH-(1–31), and human PTH-(13–34) were purchased from Bachem (Torrance, CA). Inhibitors H-89 and GF109203X were purchased from Calbiochem. Rat PTH-(1–34), 8-bromo-cyclic AMP, PMA, sodium orthovanadate, cycloheximide, and antibody for MKP-1 were obtained from Sigma. Antibodies for ERK1/2, phospho-ERK1/2, and cyclin D1 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies for p21Cip1, p27Kip1, and cAMP-response element-binding protein were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Cell Culture—UMR 106–01 cells were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, nonessential amino acids, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For experiments, cells were seeded in 100-mm dishes at a density of 1.2 × 104 cells/cm2 overnight and then switched to serum-free minimal essential medium for 1 day before the addition of PTH. Rat primary calvarial osteoblastic cells were obtained and cultured as described previously (22Shalhoub V. Gerstenfeld L.C. Collart D. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5318-5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Before PTH treatment, these cells were serum starved for 1 day. In Vivo Injection of PTH into Rats—Sprague-Dawley rats (4-week-old male, about 75 g, and 3-month old female, about 250 g) were purchased from Hilltop (Scottdale, PA). Rats were injected subcutaneously with vehicle (0.9% saline solution) or hPTH (1–38 for 4-week-old and 1–34 for 3-month-old; 8 μg/100 g) and euthanized using CO2 at the indicated time after injection. The animal protocols were approved by the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The primary spongiosa samples from the distal femur were harvested immediately after sacrifice as described previously (23Onyia J.E. Bidwell J. Herring J. Hulman J. Hock J.M.

Total RNA was isolated using Tri Reagent (Sigma) followed by purification with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). A TaqMan® Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) was used to reverse transcribe mRNA into cDNA. Following this, PCR was performed on Opticon (MJ Research) using a SYBR® Green PCR Core kit (Applied Biosystems). Each analysis was performed three to four times with independent sets of cells or tissues from PTH treatment to RT-PCR to obtain mean values and S.E. shown in the figures. The primers used for the RT-PCR are summarized in Table I. For UMR 106-01 cells, β-actin was used as an internal control.

Cells were then transfected with pCMV-hMKP-1 (a generous gift from Dr. Laura Mauro) or pCMV control vector along with the transfection marker pEGFP-F (Clontech), a plasmid containing enhanced green fluorescent protein with a farnesylation sequence. The next day, cells were trypsinized, washed once with PBS, and fixed in 70% ethanol for at least 1 h on ice. Fixed cells were washed with PBS and incubated with propidium iodide solution containing ribonuclease A. Cell cycle analyses were performed on a Beckman Coulter XL. Immunoblotting—Preparation of cell lysates and Western blot analyses were performed as described previously (24Swarthout J.T. Tyson D.R. Jefcoat Jr., S.C. Partridge N.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1401-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). PTH Regulates MKP-1 mRNA Abundance in Osteoblastic Cells—Recent microarray studies from our laboratory identified MKP-1 as a target gene for rat PTH-(1–34) in UMR 106-01 cells (25Qin L. Qiu P. Wang L. Li X. Swarthout J.T. Soteropoulos P. Tolias P. Partridge N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19723-19731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We confirmed this result by using real time RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 1A, 10-8 m rPTH-(1–34) greatly induced MKP-1 mRNA expression in UMR 106-01 cells, with a peak of 15-fold after 1 h of treatment. This induction occurs very quickly, since there is a 4-fold increase of MKP-1 expression after just 15 min of PTH treatment. Western blot demonstrates that PTH also regulates MKP-1 expression at the protein level (Fig. 2A). In untreated UMR cells, there is a very low detectable amount of MKP-1. Similar to the mRNA induction, MKP-1 protein peaks after 1 h of treatment, indicating that MKP-1 mRNA translates rapidly. A similar phenomenon is also observed in another osteoblastic cell preparation, rat primary calvarial osteoblastic cells (Fig. 1B). These cells mimic the development of osteoblasts in bone and go through three stages (proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization) sequentially when cultured in dishes. Cells at different stages were treated with rPTH-(1–34) (10-8 m) for different time periods, and the level of MKP-1 mRNA was measured by real time RT-PCR. At all developmental stages, MKP-1 levels were stimulated to the greatest level at 1 h and then decreased to base line at 4 h. The highest induction (18-fold) is observed in the mineralization stage, and the lowest (2-fold) is seen in the proliferation stage.Fig. 2PTH inhibits ERK phosphorylation through an increase in MKP-1 expression. A, UMR 106–01 cells were serum-starved for 1 day and then treated with 10-8 m rPTH-(1–34). Protein lysates were collected at the indicated time points, and the same amounts of protein (35 μg/well) were analyzed by immunoblotting using various antibodies. Western blots with total ERK1/2 antibody were used as an internal control. B, the dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 by PTH requires new protein synthesis. Control (ethanol) or 30 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) was added to the medium 30 min before the addition of 10-8 m rPTH-(1–34). C, blockage of MKP-1 activity by orthovanadate abolishes the effect of PTH on ERK1/2 dephosphorylation. 50 μm Na3VO4 was added to the medium 30 min before the addition of 10-8 m rPTH-(1–34).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Induction of MKP-1 Expression Correlates with a Decrease in ERK Phosphorylation in Osteoblastic Cells—PTH- or cAMP-generating agents such as forskolin have been shown to inhibit the basal activity of ERK1/2 or their activation by epidermal growth factor in osteoblastic cells (26Chaudhary L.R. Avioli L.V. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1998; 178: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 27Verheijen M.H. Defize L.H. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3331-3337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with those results, we found that in UMR 106-01 cells rPTH-(1–34) (10-8 m) strongly but not completely inhibits the basal phosphorylation of ERK1/2 using Western blot analysis (Fig. 2A). The maximum inhibition occurs 1 h after the addition of PTH. Since phosphorylated ERKs are substrates for MKP-1 activity, we compared the pattern of MKP-1 protein induction and ERK1/2 dephosphorylation after PTH treatment (Fig. 2A, top two panels). It is interesting to note that both patterns correlate well with maximal effects at 1 h. This result implies that the induction of MKP-1 may be responsible for the decrease in ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Next we used two approaches to test this hypothesis. First, we pretreated UMR cells with cycloheximide to inhibit de novo protein synthesis. As shown in Fig. 2B, cycloheximide completely abolished the MKP-1 protein synthesis induced by PTH. Concurrently, it also eliminated the effect of PTH on ERK dephosphorylation, suggesting that this effect requires new protein synthesis that would include MKP-1. Second, we pretreated UMR cells with orthovanadate, a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, to inhibit MKP-1 activity. Whereas the addition of orthovanadate alone had no effect on ERK phosphorylation in UMR cells, it totally abolished the dephosphorylation of ERK caused by PTH (Fig. 2C), providing more evidence that MKP-1 probably mediates the effect of PTH on the dephosphorylation of ERK. Overexpression of MKP-1 Arrests UMR 106-01 Cells in G1 Phase—MKP-1 plays an important role in cell cycle regulation. To address its role in the osteoblast, we transfected a human MKP-1 plasmid into UMR cells and measured the percentage of cells in each phase of the cell cycle by flow cytometry. Since the transfection efficiency of UMR 106-01 cells is about 20% (data not shown), we used farnesylated enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP-F) as a cotransfection marker to do this experiment. Cell cycle analyses were performed on EGFP-F-expressing cells, which should also have the MKP-1 vector. As shown in Table II, flow cytometry revealed that about 47% of UMR cells cotransfected with EGFP-F, and various amounts of pCMV vector controls are in G1 phase, and 29 and 23% of cells are in S phase and G2 + M phases, respectively. Interestingly, in cells cotransfected with EGFP-F and 1 μg/well MKP-1, there is a definite increase in the percentage of cells in G1 phase (56%) as well as a decrease in the percentage of cells in S phase (20%) and in G2 + M phases (20%). More importantly, as the amount of transfected MKP-1 plasmid increased to 2 μg/well, there were more cells in G1 phase (65%) and fewer cells in S phase (16%) and in G2 + M phase (17%). These results clearly show that overexpression of MKP-1 prevents UMR cells progressing from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle.Table IIOverexpression of MKP-1 in UMR 106-01 cells inhibits cell cycle progression from G1 to S phasePlasmidG1SG2 + M%%%EGFP-F + 1 μg of vector46.529.622.8EGFP-F + 2 μg of vector47.028.323.3EGFP-F + 1 μg of MKP-156.220.020.4EGFP-F + 2 μg of MKP-164.816.116.9 Open table in a new tab PTH Inhibits Cyclin D1 Expression Possibly through MKP-1 Regulation—The proliferative effect of phosphorylated ERK is partly mediated by its ability to induce cyclin D1 expression (28Lavoie J.N. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Muller R. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20608-20616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). Since the above data suggest that the up-regulation of MKP-1 by PTH causes the dephosphorylation of ERKs and overexpression of MKP-1 inhibits cell cycle progression, we hypothesized that similar PTH treatment will decrease cyclin D1 expression. Indeed, our previous microarray analysis suggested that cyclin D1 expression decreased to about 43% in UMR cells after 4 h of rPTH-(1–34) (10-8 m) treatment (25Qin L. Qiu P. Wang L. Li X. Swarthout J.T. Soteropoulos P. Tolias P. Partridge N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19723-19731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We confirmed this result using real time RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 3A, PTH treatment significantly decreased cyclin D1 expression to about 60% of base line at 4 and 8 h (p < 0.05). This effect is more evident at the protein level. Densitometric measurement of Western blots revealed that cyclin D1 protein was 51, 36, 28, and 42% of control after 2, 4, 8, and 24 h, respectively, of PTH treatment (Fig. 3B). It is interesting to note that the effect of PTH on cyclin D1 starts at 2 h and peaks around 4–8 h, just after the maximal effect (1 h) on MKP-1 expression and dephosphorylation of ERK. Cyclin D1 expression is also inhibited by rPTH-(1–34) (10-8m) in rat primary calvarial osteoblastic cells in the mineralization phase (Fig. 3C). After 12 h of treatment, the level of cyclin D1 mRNA significantly decreased to 65% in PTH-treated cells compared with that in control cells (p < 0.05). A 1.8-fold increase of cyclin D1 mRNA was observed after 1 h of PTH treatment. However, this increase is not statistically significant (p = 0.2). There was no effect of PTH on cyclin D1 in primary osteoblastic cells in the differentiation phase. If PTH regulation of cyclin D1 is through MKP-1 and ERK pathways, then cyclin D1 must be a secondary response gene for PTH, and this response will be eliminated when MKP-1 synthesis or activity is blocked. In fact, cycloheximide abolished the PTH effect on cyclin D1 expression in UMR cells (Fig. 3D), suggesting that this effect also requires new protein synthesis. As shown in Fig. 3E, orthovanadate had no effect on the basal expression of cyclin D1 protein (compare lanes 1 and 3). However, this MKP-1 activity inhibitor completely eliminated the inhibition of cyclin D1 by PTH treatment (compare lanes 2 and 4). Therefore, it is reasonable to propose that the effect of PTH on cyclin D1 is downstream of MKP-1 and ERK. PTH Stimulates p21Cip1, but Not p27Kip1, in UMR 106-01 and Rat Calvarial Osteoblastic Cells—To further understand the mechanism of how PTH arrests cell cycle progression of osteoblastic cells, we performed real time RT-PCR to study the expression levels of other cyclins (cyclin D2, D3, E, A, and B), CDKs (Cdk2, -4, and -6), and CDKIs (p21Cip1, p27Kip1, p57Kip2, p15, and p16) in UMR 106-01 cells after PTH treatment. Only p21Cip1, and not the other aforementioned genes, was found to be regulated by PTH. The mRNA level of p21Cip1 was quickly stimulated by PTH, with a maximal 8-fold increase at 1 h (Fig. 4A). Western blot analysis confirmed this result. Whereas there was no detectable level of p21Cip1 in untreated cells, p21Cip1 protein became obvious at 1 h and peaked between 2 and 4 h after treatment (Fig. 4B). However, there was no significant change observed in both mRNA and protein levels of p27Kip1 by PTH throughout the time course (Fig. 4, A and B). This is inconsistent with a previous study indicating that PTH stimulates the protein level of p27Kip1 (3-fold), but not p21Cip1, in UMR 106 after 12 and 24 h (21Onishi T. Hruska K. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1995-2004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reason for the discrepancy of the PTH effect on p27Kip1 is not known, but it could be due to the strain difference between UMR 106 used previously and UMR 106-01 used in the present report. Furthermore, a similar effect of PTH on p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 was also observed in primary calvarial osteoblastic cells. In cells in the differentiation phase, PTH stimulated p21Cip1 mRNA 3.8-fold at 4 h, and in cells in the mineralization phase, the induction was 2.6- and 3.5-fold at 1 and 4 h, respectively (Fig. 4C). Consistent with the above results from the UMR 106-01 cells, we did not detect a change in p27Kip1 mRNA level after PTH treatment (data not shown). Expression of MKP-1, Cyclin D1, p21Cip1, and p27Kip1 during Osteoblast Differentiation—During its differentiation, the osteoblast gradually ceases proliferation and expresses various bone-specific markers at different differentiation stages. For example, in primary calvarial cultures, alkaline phosphatase has its highest expression level during the differentiation phase, whereas osteocalcin is a marker of mineralization. To further investigate the role of the above PTH-regulated cell cycle genes, we studied their expression in primary calvarial cells during differentiation using real time RT-PCR (Fig. 5). MKP-1 mRNA increased 2-fold in both differentiation and mineralization phases compared with the proliferation phase. p21Cip1, along with another CDKI p27Kip1, was expressed to a greater extent in the later two phases, since the mRNA levels of p21Cip1 in the differentiation and mineralization phases were 6- and 5-fold that in the proliferation phase. For p27Kip1, it is 3- and 4-fold increased. These results demonstrate why the differentiated osteoblast ceases proliferation. Surprisingly, we observed that cyclin D1 had its highest expression in the differentiation phase (5-fold compared with that in the proliferation phase). As cells mineralized, its expression decreased about 50%, probably adding another mechanism preventing mineralized osteoblastic cells from proliferating. PTH Regulation of MKP-1 and p21Cip1 Is PKA-dependent and Is a Primary Response—PTH signals through both PKA and PKC pathways after binding with its receptor, PTH1R, on the osteoblast membrane (29Civitelli R. Reid I.R. Westbrook S. Avioli L.V. Hruska K.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: E660-E667PubMed Google Scholar, 30Partridge N.C. Kemp B.E. Veroni M.C. Martin T.J. Endocrinology. 1981; 108: 220-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To study which pathway PTH uses to regulate MKP-1 and p21Cip1, we took advantage of different peptide fragments of PTH that activate different pathways and inhibitors and activators of these pathways. As shown in Fig. 6A, hPTH-(1–31) (which activates PKA but not PKC) retained the ability to stimulate MKP-1 and p21Cip1 mRNA levels (21- and 8-fold, respectively) after a 1-h treatment of UMR 106-01 cells. However, hPTH-(13–34) (which activates PKC but not PKA) had no effect on the expression of those genes. In comparison, 8-bromo-cyclic AMP, a cell-permeable cAMP analog, stimulated the expression of MKP-1 and p21Cip1 about 13- and 8-fold, respectively. PMA, an activator of the PKC pathway, had very little effect on MKP-1 expression (3-fold increase compared with 22-fold increase by rPTH-(1–34)). In contrast, PMA stimulated p21Cip1 expression by 5-fold, the same level as rPTH-(1–34) achieved, indicating that p21Cip1 could be regulated by both PKA and PKC pathways. Nevertheless, in the presence of the PKA inhibitor H-89, but not in the presence of the PKC inhibitor GF109203X, rPTH-(1–34) lost its ability to induce both MKP-1 and p21Cip1, suggesting that this regulation is PKA-dependent but not PKC-dependent in osteoblastic cells. To determine whether PTH induction of MKP-1 and p21Cip1 is a primary response, UMR 106-01 cells were treated with rPTH-(1–34) (10-8 m) in the presence or the absence of cycloheximide. Fig. 6B shows that cycloheximide had no effect on the PTH induction of MKP-1 and p21Cip1, suggesting that this process does not require de novo protein synthesis (i.e. this effect is a primary response). MKP-1, Cyclin D1, and p21Cip1 Expression Are Similarly Regulated by PTH in Bone—A classic animal model for PTH anabolic function is repeated daily injection of PTH in rats. A single injection of hPTH-(1–34) (8 μg/100g) is sufficient to modify the expression of genes involved in the actions of PTH in rat osteoblast-enriched femoral metaphyseal primary spongiosa (23Onyia J.E. Bidwell J. Herring J. Hulman J. Hock J.M. Bone. 1995; 17: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We injected human PTH-(1–38) (8 μg/100 g) or saline vehicle into young male rats (4-week-old) and harvested RNA from the femoral metaphyses at various time points. Real time RT-PCR was performed to study the expression levels of MKP-1, cyclin D1, and p21Cip1 in these animals. Fig. 7 demonstrates that one injection of PTH greatly stimulated MKP-1 expression with a 7-fold"

As the main transactivator, the p65 subunit of NF-κB has an outstanding position in the hierarchy of NF-κB proteins. p65 is a multiply phosphorylated protein with phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal transactivation domain and the N-terminal Rel homology domain (RHD). In this study, we describe two previously non-reported phospho-acceptor sites within the p65 RHD. We show that differential phosphorylation of serine residues within the RHD modulates transcriptional activity in a cis-acting element and promoter-specific context, thus leading to a phosphorylation state-dependent gene expression profile. RelA-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts reconstituted with wild-type p65 or p65 phosphorylation-deficient mutants showed a distinctive expression profile of synthetic κB-dependent reporters as well as endogenous genes. Hypophosphorylated p65 did not display cis-acting element-specific changes in DNA binding or dimerization behavior. This study shows for the first time that site-specific phosphorylation can target a transcription factor to a particular subset of genes.

In this study, we describe two previously non-reported phospho-acceptor sites within the p65 RHD. We show that differential phosphorylation of serine residues within the RHD modulates transcriptional activity in a cis-acting element and promoter-specific context, thus leading to a phosphorylation state-dependent gene expression profile. RelA-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts reconstituted with wild-type p65 or p65 phosphorylation-deficient mutants showed a distinctive expression profile of synthetic κB-dependent reporters as well as endogenous genes. Hypophosphorylated p65 did not display cis-acting element-specific changes in DNA binding or dimerization behavior. This study shows for the first time that site-specific phosphorylation can target a transcription factor to a particular subset of genes. Protein phosphorylation is used in many different ways to control the activity of transcription factors. It directs subcellular localization (e.g. nuclear factor of activated cells (1Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar)), selectively controls binding of dimerization partners (e.g. signal transducers and activators of transcription (2Horvath C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 496-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar)), or alters transcriptional activity by facilitating the interaction with components of the transcriptional machinery (e.g. cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein (3Chrivia J.C.

NF-κB is a key transcription factor in regulating expression of pro-inflammatory, immune-modulatory, and anti-apoptotic genes (6Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3427) Google Scholar). Cellular activation by a broad array of stimuli, including cytokines, bacterial lipopolysaccharides, viruses, and radiation, results in liberation of dimeric NF-κB from cytoplasmic inhibitory molecules (IκBs). Upon nuclear import and binding to specific decameric recognition motifs, which are reflected by the consensus GGGRHTYYCC (R, purine; Y, pyrimidine; H, not G), NF-κB dimers function as trans-acting elements in the promoter region of NF-κB-dependent genes. Transcriptional activity of nuclear NF-κB complexes is controlled by posttranslational modifications including acetylation (7Chen L. Fischle W. Verdin E. Greene W.C. Science. 2001; 293: 1653-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar) and phosphorylation (8Vermeulen L. De Wilde G. Notebaert S. Berghe VandenW. Haegeman G. Biochem.

Although the role of individual phospho-serines is not fully determined, it has been shown that they regulate p65 interaction with nuclear co-activator cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein binding protein/p300 (5Zhong H.

We address the functional importance of these residues for NF-κB transcriptional activity. We show that differential phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 RHD modulates transcriptional activity in a cis-acting element and promoter-specific context, leading to phosphorylation state-dependent gene expression profiles. RelA-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts reconstituted with wt p65 or p65 phosphorylation-deficient mutants showed a distinctive expression profile of synthetic κB-dependent reporters as well as endogenous genes. Cell Culture and Reagents—Bovine aortic endothelial cells were obtained from VEC Technologies (Rensselaer, NY) and used between passages four and nine. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) isolated from RelA-/- mice were kindly provided by Dr. A. Beg (Columbia University, New York, NY) and have been described previously (18Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (MediaTech Inc., Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin B (all Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, GA) in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was purchased from Sigma (L-7261) and recombinant murine interferon-γ was from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Plasmid Constructs—All p65 mutants were constructed by primer overlap extension as described (19Anrather J. Csizmadia V. Soares M.P. Winkler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13594-13603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). All p65 constructs were expressed from the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and feature an N-terminal c-myc tag. The 3xκB-Luc construct has been described previously (20Brostjan C. Anrather J. Csizmadia V. Natarajan G. Winkler H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3836-3844PubMed Google Scholar). Other κB reporter constructs were generated by replacing the minimal SV40 promoter in the pGL3-promoter vector (Promega, Madison, WI) with a minimal promoter 5′-GAT CTG GGT ATA TAA TGG ATC CCC GGG TAC GCA GCT CAA GCT-3′ that was obtained by annealing complementary oligonucleotides that feature BglII (5′-end) and HindIII (3′-end) compatible overhangs. Double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides coding for a tandem κB site were cloned upstream of this minimal promoter using KpnI and SacI restriction sites. All oligonucleotides were designed to differ only in their decameric κB consensus sequence. The prototypical sequence is 5′-GCT-decamer-CTG AGC TCC T-decamer-CTC AGC T-3′. The bicistronic retroviral vector pLXIH, which uses the 5′-long terminal repeat to drive expression of the transgene and the resistance gene was obtained by replacing the neomycin resistance gene of the pLXIN vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) with a hygromycin resistance gene cassette. p65 wt and mutants were cloned into pLXIH by standard procedures. All constructs were verified by partial DNA sequencing using Dye Terminator chemistry. More detailed information on plasmids and cloning procedures can be obtained from the authors. Reporter Gene Assays—Bovine aortic endothelial cells were transfected as described (20Brostjan C. Anrather J. Csizmadia V. Natarajan G. Winkler H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3836-3844PubMed Google Scholar). RelA-/- MEFs were grown in 12-well plates and transfected at 70–80% confluency. Cells were exposed to 400 ng of DNA (200 ng of reporter plasmid, 40 ng of p65 wt or mutant expression plasmid, 120 ng of pcDNA3, and 40 ng of cytomegalovirus/β-galactosidase control plasmid) and 1.6 μl of Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 6 h. After addition of fetal bovine serum to a final concentration of 10%, cells were allowed to recover for 40 h. Cells were lysed with 0.075% Triton X-100 in 0.1 m KH2PO4, pH 7.8, and supernatants were assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity as described (20Brostjan C. Anrather J. Csizmadia V. Natarajan G. Winkler H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3836-3844PubMed Google Scholar). Stable Transfectants—Stable RelA-/- MEFs expressing wt p65 or p65 mutants were generated by transfecting cells with pcDNA3 carrying wt p65 or mutants along with pcDNA3.1/Hygro (Invitrogen) in a 5:1 ratio. Single colonies were isolated by limiting dilution and selected in growth medium containing 300 μg/ml Hygromycin B. Cell clones were screened by Western blot analysis for p65 expression. At least two different clones were used for experiments. Retrovirus containing supernatants were obtained after transiently transfecting the EcoPack2-293 ecotropic packaging cell line (Clontech) using Lipofectamine. Virus-containing supernatants were harvested 48 and 72 h after transfection. Viral titers were determined by titration on NIH 3T3 cells and were >1 × 105/ml. RelA-/- MEFs were infected by exposing cells to retrovirus containing supernatants in the presence of 8 μg/ml of Polybrene (Sigma) for 24 h. Stable transduced cell pools were selected in medium containing 300 μg/ml Hygromycin B over 7 days, after which cells were used for experiments. All experiments were repeated twice with cell pools derived from different infections. Gene Expression Analysis—Probes for Northern blot analysis were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from reverse transcribed RNA isolated from murine MEFs. Primers for generating a 709-bp fragment of the H2-K MHC class I gene product were 5′-CTG AAC GAA GAC CTG AAA ACG-3′ and 5′-CTG TCA CCA AGT CCA CTC CAG-3′, respectively. A 489-bp fragment of the β-actin gene was amplified using the primers 5′-ACC GTG AAA AGA TGA CCC AGA TC-3′ and 5′-TAG TTT CAT GGA TGC CAC AGG-3′. Northern blots were performed as described (20Brostjan C. Anrather J. Csizmadia V. Natarajan G. Winkler H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3836-3844PubMed Google Scholar). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed on single-stranded DNA that was generated with Superscript II reverse transcriptase and oligo-dT primers (Invitrogen) using 1 μg of DNase I-treated total RNA as template. Reverse transcription was carried out according to the manufacturers' suggestions. Gene-specific primers were used to amplify fragments of the H2-K MHC class I (5′-CTG AAC GAA GAC CTG AAA ACG-3′ and 5′-ATC AAC TCC TCC CCA TTC AAC-3′; 299-bp amplicon), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1; 5′-ACA CTC TTA CCT GTG CGC TGT-3′ and 5′-ATT TCC CGG TAT CTT CAA TGG-3′; 314-bp amplicon), ICAM-1 (5′-TCC TAA AAT GAC CTG CAG ACG-3′ and 5′-AGT TTT ATG GCC TCC TCC TGA-3′; 314-bp amplicon), and β-actin (for primers, see above) genes. The number of amplification cycles was chosen in the exponential range of the reaction and was 16 cycles for β-actin, 20 cycles for MHC class I, 30 cycles for VCAM-1, and 35 cycles for ICAM-1, respectively. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was carried out using SYBR Green chemistry (Invitrogen) on a Chromo4 continuous fluorescence monitoring thermocycler (MJ Research, Waltham, MA). The sequence of the primer set used in qPCR reactions to generate a 123-bp, cDNA-specific ICAM-1 amplicon was 5′-GCC TTG GTA GAG GTG ACT GAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAC CGG AGC TGA AAA GTT GTA-3′ (reverse). The sequence of the primer set to generate a 123-bp VCAM-1 amplicon was 5′-TGC CGA GCT AAA TTA CAC ATT G-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCT TGT GGA GGG ATG TAC AGA-3′ (reverse). The sequence of the primer set used in qPCR reactions to generate a 139-bp, cDNA-specific, interleukin-6 (IL-6) amplicon was 5′-ATG GAT GCT ACC AAA CTG GAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGA AGG ACT CTG GCT TTG TCT-3′ (reverse). An 81-bp amplicon for MHC class I was generated with primers 5′-GAT ACC TGA AGA ACG GGA ACG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTT CAG GTC TGC TGT GAT GG-3′ (reverse). A 94-bp amplicon specific for manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) was generated with primers 5′-ACA GAT TGC TGC CTG CTC TAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTA GTA AGC GTG CTC CCA CAC-3′ (reverse). A 102-bp amplicon specific for monocyte inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2) was generated with primers 5′-AAC ATC CAG AGC TTG AGT GTG A-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTC AGG GTC AAG GCA AAC TT-3′ (reverse). A primer set for the housekeeping gene hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase was used to amplify a 103-bp amplicon from total cDNA: forward, 5′-AGT GTT GGA TAC AGG CCA GAC-3′ and reverse, 5′-CGT GAT TCA AAT CCC TGA AGT-3′. Real-time PCR reactions were run in triplicates under the following conditions: a 10-min initial denaturing step at 94 °C, 45 cycles of 15 s at 94 °C, and 1 min at 60 °C. At each cycle, fluorescence was quantified after product extension at 60 °C. Product melting curves were generated for each reaction to ensure product fidelity. Quantitative changes in mRNA concentration were calculated according to Livak and Schmittgen (21Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (121148) Google Scholar). Western Blotting, Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA), and Protein Phosphorylation—Western blots using anti-p65 antibody (sc-372, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, San Diego, CA), preparation of nuclear extracts, EMSA, and two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps were carried out as described previously (19Anrather J. Csizmadia V. Soares M.P. Winkler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13594-13603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Upper-strand sequences of oligonucleotides used for EMSA were 5′-AGTTGAGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′ (Ig κ light chain enhancer), 5′-AGTTGAGGG GATTTCCCAGGC-3′ (human ELAM-1 enhancer), and 5′-AGTTGAGGGAATCTCCCAGGC-3′ (IL-2 receptor-α enhancer). Co-immunoprecipitations—RelA-/- MEFs were transiently transfected with expression vectors for wt p65 or p65 serine mutants together with a p50 expression plasmid. Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were treated with LPS (1 μg/ml) for 45 min, washed with ice-cold PBS, and lysed for 30 min on ice in immunoprecipitation buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5% Triton X-100) containing protease (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) and phosphatase (Sigma) inhibitor mixtures. Lysates were forced four times through a 26-gauge needle and cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Equal amounts of lysate were incubated with 2 μg of p50-specific polyclonal antibody (sc-114; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) together with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose slurry or with 20 μl of agarose coupled anti-c-myc monoclonal antibody (sc-40AC, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C with continuous agitation. Immunocomplexes were washed four times in immunoprecipitation buffer, and precipitated proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were probed with c-myc or p50-specific antibodies as indicated. Identification and Characterization of p65 RHD Phospho-acceptor Sites—We used reporter gene assays together with a site-directed mutagenesis approach to identify potentially phosphorylated serine residues within p65 RHD. Eighteen single Ser-to-Ala mutants and one double mutant (p65 S238/240A) were expressed in bovine aortic endothelial cells and monitored for transcriptional activity using a NF-κB-dependent reporter construct that carries three NF-κB binding sites derived from the porcine E-selectin promoter (20Brostjan C. Anrather J. Csizmadia V. Natarajan G. Winkler H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3836-3844PubMed Google Scholar). This approach revealed serine 205, 276, and 281 as being essential for p65 transcriptional activity (Fig. 1a). There was a limited effect of S42A and S75A substitutions on p65-mediated transcription, which was reduced by 50% in both mutants. The hypothesis that identified serines are indeed phosphorylated in vivo is strengthened by the fact that threonine substitutions at positions 205 and 276 were able to rescue p65 transcriptional activity (Fig. 1b), thus implying that these residues might be targeted by Ser/Thr-directed protein kinases. In contrast, Thr substitution at position 281 did not restore activity, which suggests that this position, if actually phosphorylated, is a substrate for a serine-restricted protein kinase. To address whether identified serines are phosphorylated in vivo, we prepared phospho-peptide maps of p65 proteins expressed in RelA-/- MEFs that have been exposed to LPS. All mutant proteins as well as wt p65 were multiply phosphorylated (Fig. 1c). Wild-type p65 showed at least six distinct phospho-peptides. All p65 mutants showed different phosphorylation patterns and lost at least one phospho-peptide species as compared with the wt protein. All mutants displayed residual phospho-peptides, indicating that p65 is multiply phosphorylated, as expected from previous results (19Anrather J. Csizmadia V. Soares M.P. Winkler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13594-13603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the S205A mutant showed the largest decrease in phosphorylated peptide species. This finding could point to sequential phosphorylation, where a phospho-serine at position 205 would be required for other phosphorylation reactions to take place. Differences in intensities of separated phospho-peptides imply that not all serines are phosphorylated in the totality of cellular p65 proteins. Differential p65 Phosphorylation Targets NF-κB Activity to Gene Subsets—We first analyzed expression of three genes in RelA-/- MEFs derived clonal cell lines reconstituted with wt p65 or p65 phosphorylation deficient mutants. We determined LPS-induced mRNA levels for ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and MHC class I genes by Northern blotting and semi-quantitative RT-PCR, respectively. Although MHC class I mRNA was increased by wt p65 as well as all p65 mutants (Fig. 2, a and b), ICAM-1 was detected only in wt p65-expressing cells, although we observed, in two of five independent experiments, ICAM-1 mRNA in cells expressing the p65 S205A mutant. VCAM-1 was efficiently induced by wt p65 and to a lesser extent by p65 S205A. Analysis was extended using qPCR to analyze mRNA levels for ICAM-1, VCAM-1, MHC class I, IL-6, Mn-SOD, and MIP-2 gene products. For this set of experiments, retrovirally transduced cell pools rather than single-cell clones were used. Furthermore, cells were activated by combined LPS (1 μg/ml) and interferon-γ (100 units/ml) treatment. All genes tested were induced after LPS/interferon-γ exposure (Fig. 3). Induction in empty vector-transduced cells was limited (ICAM-1, 5-fold; VCAM-1, MHC class I, and MIP-2, 3-fold; IL-6, 70-fold; and MnSOD, 2-fold). In the resting state, wt p65-expressing cells showed higher mRNA levels of all genes analyzed than cells transduced with p65 serine mutants or empty vector. After LPS/interferon-γ stimulation, expression profiles for ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and MHC class I genes were comparable with the ones obtained with LPS stimulation alone (Fig. 2). IL-6 was expressed in a p65 phosphorylation-dependent manner showing highest induction in wt p65 and lowest in p65 S281A-expressing cells. S205A and S276A mutants induced MnSOD as efficiently as wt p65, whereas the S281A mutants showed reduced expression levels. Similar to ICAM-1, the mouse GROα analog MIP-2 was only efficiently induced by wt p65 and to a much lesser extent by the p65 S205A mutant.Fig. 3Quantitative analysis of endogenous gene expression in RelA-/- cells reconstituted with wt p65 or serine mutants. mRNA levels were analyzed by qPCR as described under “Materials and Methods.” Cells were stimulated with 1 μg/ml of LPS and 100 units/ml of interferon-γ for 6 h. Expression levels of unstimulated, vector-transfected cells were set to 1, and fold induction for all other experimental groups was calculated. Bars represent mean fold induction ± S.E. (n = 3, derived from three independent experiments using three different retrovirally transduced cell pools).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The genomic organization of the respective enhancers is presented in Fig. 4. IL-6, MIP-2, and MnSOD intronic enhancer feature a single NF-κB consensus site, whereas ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and MHC class I H2-K enhancers carry two κB sites, one which is located far upstream (-1390) in the ICAM-1 promoter. Individual consensus sequences are highly conserved between mouse and human. In fact, only the κB consensus in the MnSOD enhancer is changed at position +3 (G for C) relative to the mouse sequence. Other cis-acting elements include the interferon responsive element in ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and MHC genes, Sp-1 consensus sites in ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and MIP-2 genes, CAAT/enhancer binding protein binding sites in ICAM-1, IL-6, and MnSOD, whereas IL-6 and MHC genes feature binding sites for members of the ATF/cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein family of transcription factors. Transcriptional Activity of Differentially Phosphorylated p65 Is cis-Acting Element Restricted—The most likely explanation for different p65 phosphorylation status-dependent gene transcription is that the sequence of a κB consensus site within a promoter will dictate the requirement for p65 phosphorylation. To test this hypothesis, we investigated transcriptional activity of differentially phosphorylated p65 proteins on an array of decameric κB consensus sequences. To evaluate different NF-κB consensus sites, reporters were constructed in a way that only the decameric NF-κB consensus site was altered. When reporters containing two copies of a given κB consensus site were expressed alone or together with wt p65 or mutants, they could be divided into three groups according to their expression characteristics. Transcription from the first group (Fig. 5, a–e) of reporter constructs was only efficiently induced by wt p65. There was little or no induction when the reporters where co-transfected with p65 serine mutants. This group included highly asymmetric κB sites that fit a GGRWWWYYYY consensus. Similarly, reporter constructs of the second group (Fig. 5, f–j) gave a characteristic expression profile. They were activated strongest by p65 wt, followed by the serine 205, 276, and 281 mutants with decreasing activity and are represented by a KGRAHWTYCC consensus. The third group consisted of binding sites that harbor four guanine bases in the 5′-half of the consensus sequence or represented a complete palindrome (Fig. 5, k–m). These constructs were induced by wt p65 and p65 mutants to a similar extent, with p65 S276A mutant showing the highest induction and which fit a GGGRATTYCC consensus. There was no transcriptional activity from a reporter construct harboring scrambled decamers, underlining that transcriptional activation is indeed achieved through the respective κB binding sites and not through other sequences within the reporter construct (Fig. 5h). Group I showed a prevalence for a thymidine at the 3′-prime end (three of five) or a cytidine at position +2 (three of five), both features not seen in group II and III consensus sequences. Binding sites within group II showed, with the exception of ICAM-1, an adherence to 5′-GGRA-3′ at the 5′-end and to 5′-TYCC-3′ at the 3′-end, while showing substantial heterogeneity at positions -1 and +1. Group III sequences had a preference for four guanidines at the 5′-end (two of three) and featured a conservative TTYCC sequence in the 3′-half site. It is noteworthy that a single T-for-C substitution at the 3′-end can completely alter the transcriptional profile when engaged by differentially phosphorylated p65 proteins. Although transcription from the pig ELAM-1 κB site (GGGAATTCCT) was only driven by wt p65, all mutant proteins where equally capable of driving transcription from a palindromic GGGAATTCCC consensus sequence. DNA Binding and Dimerization Behavior of Differentially Phosphorylated p65 Mutants—For DNA binding studies, we used one sequence of each group of κB binding sites showing characteristic expression profiles when positioned upstream of a reporter gene. Thus, we studied NF-κB binding to the IL-2 receptor-α κB (GGGAATCTCC, group I), Ig κ light chain κB (GGGACTTTCC, group II), and human ELAM-1 κB (GGGGATTTCC, group III) sites. Several DNA protein complexes with different electrophoretic mobility could be resolved (Fig. 6). The complex with the greatest mobility was composed of p50 homodimers as identified by specific removal of this complex by p50-specific antiserum (Fig 7a). This complex was found in all p65 and empty vector-transfected MEF extracts. RelA-/- MEFs transfected with wt p65 or p65 serine mutants but not empty vector-transfected cells showed two additional complexes that were identified as p50/p65 heterodimers and p65 homodimers by supershift analysis (Fig 7a). We could not detect any c-Rel-containing complexes. The relative abundance of p50 homodimers resulted most likely from the experimental design and limitations imposed by the transient transfection model, which results in 20–30% transfected cells as assayed by flow cytometry using transfected green fluorescent protein as a marker. Because p50 homodimers are a major NF-κB species in RelA-/- cells, this will result in a relative overpresentation of p50 homodimers in nuclear extracts.

https://openalex.org/W1985992145,"Salla disease and infantile sialic acid storage disorder are autosomal recessive neurodegenerative diseases characterized by loss of a lysosomal sialic acid transport activity and the resultant accumulation of free sialic acid in lysosomes. Genetic analysis of these diseases has identified several unique mutations in a single gene encoding a protein designated sialin (Verheijen, F. W., Verbeek, E., Aula, N., Beerens, C. E., Havelaar, A.

From the biochemical phenotype of the diseases and the predicted polytopic structure of the protein, it has been suggested that sialin functions as a lysosomal sialic acid transporter. Here we directly demonstrate that this activity is mediated by sialin and that the recombinant protein has functional characteristics similar to the native lysosomal sialic acid transport system. Furthermore, we describe the effect of disease-causing mutations on the protein. We find that the majority of the mutations are associated with a complete loss of activity, while the mutations associated with the milder forms of the disease lead to reduced, but residual, function. Thus, there is a direct correlation between sialin function and the disease state. In addition, we find with one mutation that the protein is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, indicating that altered trafficking of sialin is also associated with disease.

This analysis of the molecular mechanism of sialic acid storage disorders is a further step in identifying therapeutic approaches to these diseases. Lysosomes are intracellular acidic organelles filled with hydrolytic enzymes. They are primarily responsible for the compartmentalized degradation of macromolecules as part of an intrinsic turnover process and as a mechanism for processing endocytosed nutrients. The importance of these organelles in normal cellular functions is apparent from the phenotype of a group of degenerative diseases designated as lysosomal storage disorders (3Schiffmann R. Brady R.O. Drugs. 2002; 62: 733-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 4Moser H.W. Curr. Opin. Neurol. Neurosurg. 1992; 5: 355-358PubMed Google Scholar). The hallmark of these disorders is the accumulation of material within enlarged lysosomes. The typical clinical phenotype is one of a progressive multiorgan involvement with a predominance of neurological dysfunction and often early death. For many of these diseases genetic studies have identified causative mutations, most of which occur in genes encoding enzymes involved in the hydrolysis of macromolecules. The major products of the enzymatic processes in lysosomes are small organic molecules. While the membrane-bound nature of the organelle allows for hydrolytic enzymes to be isolated from the cytosol, it also requires mechanisms for the release of these end products. Biochemical studies have identified several lysosomal transport systems that facilitate the movement of amino acids, nucleotides, lipids, vitamins, and sugars across the lysosomal membrane (5Pisoni R.L. Thoene J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 351-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 6Mancini G.M. Havelaar A.C. Verheijen F.W. J. Inherit. Metab Dis. 2000; 23: 278-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, the molecular identification of the lysosomal transport systems has been difficult. Their intracellular localization and the presence of lysosomes or an equivalent organelle in all eukaryotic cells have hampered the use of expression cloning. Genetic studies of lysosomal storage disorders have offered some insight into the molecular mechanisms of the transport processes. For example, the gene mutated in cystinosis has been shown to encode a lysosomal cystine transporter (7Town M. Jean G. Cherqui S. Attard M. Forestier L. Whitmore S.A. Callen D.F. Gribouval O. Broyer M. van't Bates G.P. Hoff W. Antignac C. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), while a fatty acid transporter (NPC1) localized to lysosomes and endosomes has been shown to be the product of a gene mutated in Niemann-Pick disease Type C (8Davies J.P.

Recent evidence also indicates that CLN3, the protein mutated in one form of Batten Disease, mediates a lysosomal arginine-H+ antiport activity (10Kim Y. Ramirez-Montealegre D. Pearce D.A. Proc.

Verbeek E. Aula N. Beerens C.E. Havelaar A.C. Joosse M. Peltonen L. Aula P. van der Galjaard H. Spek P.J. Mancini G.M. Nat.

Salla Disease is characterized by developmental delay with marked cognitive and motor impairment noticeable at 6–12 months of age. However, many affected individuals reach adulthood (11Varho T.T. Alajoki L.E. Posti K.M. Korhonen T.T. Renlund M.G. Nyman S.R. Sillanpaa M.L. Aula P.P. Pediatr. Neurol. 2002; 26: 267-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). ISSD has a more severe phenotype with intrauterine hydrops, neonatal ascites, dysmorphic features, and death by 2 years of age. The cellular pathology for both diseases consists of enlarged lysosomes filled with high concentrations of free sialic acid, an amino sugar related to neuraminic acid (12Aula P. Autio S. Raivio K.O.

Neurology. 1983; 33: 57-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The free sialic acid is derived from the oligosaccharide chains of sialylated glycoproteins and glycolipids that have been degraded in the lysosme. Previous studies have demonstrated that individuals with Salla disease and ISSD accumulate free sialic acid in their lysosomes due to a defect in a proton-coupled sialic acid transport activity (14Renlund M. Aula P. Raivio K.O. Autio S. Sainio K. Rapola J. Koskela S.L. Neurology. 1983; 33: 57-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Renlund M. Tietze F. Gahl W.A.

Chem. 1989; 264: 15316-15322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite clear differences in the severity of the clinical phenotypes, both forms of the disease are associated with no detectable lysosomal sialic acid transport. Genetic studies of individuals with Salla Disease led to the determination that a gene encoding a protein designated sialin contains the causative mutations (1Verheijen F.W. Verbeek E. Aula N. Beerens C.E. Havelaar A.C. Joosse M. Peltonen L. Aula P. van der Galjaard H. Spek P.J. Mancini G.M. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 462-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Sialin is a member of the anion/cation symporter (ACS) family of proteins and has a high degree of similarity to the vesicular glutamate transporters (VGUT1–3) (17Reimer R.J. Edwards R.H. Pfluegers Arch. 2004; 447: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To date 16 mutations in sialin have been associated with the disease phenotype (2Aula N. Salomaki P. Timonen R. Verheijen F. Mancini G. Mansson J.E. Aula P. Peltonen L. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 67: 832-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The most common mutation (R39C) is found in Salla disease. The more severe ISSD is associated with four other missense mutations (K136E, H183R, P334R, G371V), a short deletion (Δ268–272), and 10 mutations that lead to early truncations or large deletions. To better understand the mechanisms by which mutations may lead to disease, we sought to characterize the function of sialin. By altering a potential lysosomal targeting domain we are able to express the protein on the cell surface allowing for the use of whole cell uptake assays to measure transport activity. Using this approach we directly demonstrate that sialin is a sialic acid transporter with characteristics similar to those of the native lysosomal transport system. Through characterizing the effect of disease-associated mutations on transport activity we show a direct correlation between the degree of transport activity lost and the severity of the clinical phenotype. In addition, we demonstrate that one mutation leads to retention of the protein in the endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting that altered trafficking of sialin can also contribute to the pathophysiology of these disorders. Isolation of Rat Sialin cDNA and Mutagenesis—The predicted human sialin peptide sequence was used to identify expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in the rat sequence data base (NCBI). Oligonucleotides corresponding to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the coding sequence were generated and high fidelity PCR (Turbo Pfu, Stratagene) was used to amplify the sequence from PC12 cell cDNA. The cDNA was subcloned into the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). To introduce disease-associated mutations and restriction sites for epitope tagging, site-directed mutagenesis was carried out with the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) following the directions of the manufacturer. The DNA was submitted to a commercial sequence facility for ABI automated sequencing to confirm generation of the desired mutation. To facilitate the generation of a subset of constructs an NheI site was introduced into the amino-terminal portion of the protein resulting in a conservative mutation (N41G), which did not alter the localization or function of the protein. Cell Culture and Heterologous Expression—HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% Cosmic-calf serum (Hyclone). All cultures were kept at 37 °C in 5% CO2, and all media contained penicillin and streptomycin. To transiently express cDNAs in HeLa cells, Effectene (Qiagen) was used according to the instructions of the manufacturer. For cotransfection, equal amounts of DNA were used with the total amount corresponding to that recommended by the manufacturer. Immunofluorescence of Cultured Cells—HeLa cells were plated at 80,000 per well in 24-well plates. Approximately 20 h later the cells were transfected as described above and the following day split ∼1:3 onto glass coverslips pretreated with poly-d-lysine (Sigma). Immunofluorescence staining was carried out as described previously (18Kent H.M. McMahon H.T. Evans P.R. Benmerah A. Owen D.J. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 1139-1148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and coverslips mounted on glass slides using Mowiol (Calbiochem). The rabbit anti-HA antibody (Abcam) was used at 1:2,000 and the mouse anti-PDI antibody (Stressgen) was used at 1:50. Secondary antibodies labeled with Alexa 488 or Alexa 568 (Molecular Probes) were diluted at 1:1,000. Zeiss Axiovert 100M inverted microscope configured for confocal microscopy (LSM 5 PASCAL, Zeiss) was used for imaging. Transport Assay—HeLa cells were plated on 24-well plates at a density of 70,000 per well and the following day transfected as described above. After 24–36 h, transport assays with radiolabeled N-acetylneuraminic acid (0.05 μCi/well (∼3.6 μm final concentration)) (American Radiolabeled Chemicals) were carried out as described previously (19Wreden C.C. Johnson J. Tran C. Seal R.P. Copenhagen D.R. Reimer R.J. Edwards R.H. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1265-1275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For controls LYAAT1, a lysosomal transporter previously characterized with whole cell uptake assays (19Wreden C.C. Johnson J. Tran C. Seal R.P. Copenhagen D.R. Reimer R.J. Edwards R.H. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1265-1275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was used and the background was subtracted for saturation, inhibition, and pH dependence studies. Statistical analyses were performed using the Prism program (GraphPad Software). For the time course each point is the mean of two separate samples. For all other experiments results are from four experiments with error bars indicating the standard error of the mean. Labeling of Cell Surface Proteins—Cells in the wells of a 24-well plate were rinsed twice with CMF-PBS and then 300 μl of CMF-PBS with 5 mm EDTA was added to each well. Cells were triturated and samples from 3 wells were combined. After centrifugation at 800 × g the cells were rinsed with 500 μl of ice-cold borate buffered saline (50 mm borate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.2) and then incubated in 125 μl of 2 mm sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) in borate buffered saline for 30 min on ice. 500 μl of CMF-PBS with 10 mm glycine was then added to quench the labeling reaction. After pelleting the cells, biotinylated proteins were isolated on NeutrAvadin beads (Pierce) as described previously (20Seal R.P. Leighton B.H. Amara S.G. Neuron. 2000; 25: 695-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Western Analysis—Samples were separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Pall), and immunoblotted as described previously (21Chaudhry F.A. Reimer R.J. Bellocchio E.E. Danbolt N.C. Osen K.K. Edwards R.H. Storm-Mathisen J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9733-9750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Detection of hybridization was done with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) and exposure of the blot to autoradiography film (Cole Parmer Blue-Sensitive) for 15 s to 5 min. The rabbit anti-HA antibody (Chemicon) was used at 1:1,000, and the horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit antibody (Pierce) was used at 1:10,000. Determination of Relative Specific Transport Activity—To determine relative specific activity, transport activity and quantitative analysis of cell surface expression were carried out in parallel experiments for the wild-type, R39C, and K136E mutants with the dileucine motifs disrupted. Transport was measured at 3 min as described above. For quantification of cell surface protein expression Western blots were scanned and converted to a TIFF file for analysis. Regions of interest were identified and quantified in density units using NIH Image. The corresponding region in a lane with a sample from cells transfected the untagged LYAAT1 protein was measured as background and subtracted from all values. Relative specific activity for each mutant was calculated from the following equation: [uptake by mutant (pmols/3 min)/uptake by wild type (pmols/3 min)]/[mutant expression level (density units)/wild-type expression level (density units)]. Mutations Associated with Disease Occur in Conserved Residues—To facilitate the characterization of the physiological role of sialin we identified a rat orthologue of the human protein. A BLAST search of available rat ESTs led to the identification of separate ESTs corresponding to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the rat sialin cDNA. Oligonucleotide primers were designed to generate a sequence corresponding to the open reading frame of the cDNA. Amplification of the sequence generated a cDNA that predicts a 495-amino acid peptide with 12 transmembrane domains and 86% identity and 90% similarity to the human protein. A similar degree of homology is also noted in comparisons of the rat or human sequences to the identified murine or ovine sequences (Fig. 1). Sequence comparison of the mammalian proteins indicates that the disease-causing point mutations occur throughout the protein with no obvious clustering. The predicted topology suggests that the mutations occur in residues within (H183R, P334R, and G371V) or abutting (R39C, K136E) transmembrane domains. In contrast, the amino acids excised in the short deletion are in the middle of a well defined extramembraneous region. The residues associated with the mutations are highly conserved among the mammalian proteins; the only variation is a single conservative substitution in the deleted segment of one species. The absence of structure-function analysis of sialin or related proteins precludes predictions about the influence of the mutations based on their location in the protein. Disruption of Putative Adaptor Protein-binding Domain Leads to Plasma Membrane Expression of Sialin—Measuring transport activity of recombinant sialin is complicated by the fact that the protein is likely expressed in all cells of higher eukaryotic organisms. To circumvent the problem of endogenous lysosomal sialic acid transport activity we sought to generate a form of sialin that traffics to the cell surface, thus allowing for whole cell uptake assays to measure activity of the recombinant protein. While a plasma membrane sialic acid transport activity has been described (22Hirschberg C.B. Goodman S.R. Green C. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3591-3599Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we found no measurable uptake in intact HeLa cells, suggesting that this approach would be feasible. In analyzing sialin sequences from different species we noted a short sequence (DXXPLL) in the cytosolic amino terminus that is conserved from Xenopus laevis to humans (Fig. 2A). A dileucine with an acidic amino acid 4 residues upstream is a consensus motif for adaptor protein (AP) binding (23Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). Since interactions with AP1 or AP3 are required for proper targeting of some lysosomal membrane proteins (23Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether this domain in sialin is involved in trafficking. We first replaced the amino-terminal cytosolic domain of sialin, containing the motif, with the corresponding region of NaPi-1, a structurally related protein that resides on the plasma membrane (24Busch A.E. Schuster A. Waldegger S. Wagner C.A. Zempel G. Broer S. Biber J. Murer H. Lang F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5347-5351Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). When heterologously expressed in HeLa cells, the HA-tagged chimeric protein no longer displays a pattern of large puncta typical of lysosomal antigens but stains finer structures within the cell. It also appears to be present on the plasma membrane (Fig. 2B). To further refine the sequence necessary for lysosomal targeting, in separate constructs we mutated the leucines and altered the spacing between the leucines and the acidic residue. These changes have been shown to disrupt the interaction of the lysosomal protein LIMP2 with AP3 and to alter targeting of the protein (25Sandoval I.V. Martinez-Arca S. Valdueza J. Palacios S. Holman G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39874-39885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Replacing both leucines with alanines (L22A,L23A) or inserting two additional amino acids (alanines) between the acidic residue and the dileucine of sialin (20AAins21) resulted in an expression pattern similar to the NaPi-1-sialin chimera, indicating that this specific motif within the amino terminus facilitates lysosomal targeting of sialin (Fig. 2B). Sialin Is a pH-dependent Sialic Acid Transporter—Disruption of the targeting sequence enables measurements of activity at the plasma membrane through whole cell uptake assays. The orientation of the protein, with the lumenal side facing out, is such that whole cell uptake corresponds to the transport of sialic acid out of the lysosome. Transporters are often reversible, but asymmetries in relative affinity can exist at the two sides of the transporter. Even though the physiologically relevant activity for the lysosomal sialic acid transport system is to mediate the outward movement of sialic acid, the most comprehensive studies on the native transport system have relied on the reversibility of the transport system and measured uptake into intact lysosomes (26Mancini G.M. de Jonge H.R. Galjaard H. Verheijen F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15247-15254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Mancini G.M. Beerens C.E. Aula P.P. Verheijen F.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1329-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 28Havelaar A.C. Beerens C.E. Mancini G.M. Verheijen F.W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). With sialin mistargeted to the cell surface, however, the activity measured will more directly reflect the physiologically relevant function of the protein. For initial studies, to make the extracellular environment approximate the acidic lysosomal lumen, the cells were incubated in a Krebs-Ringer solution buffered with MES at pH 5.5. A marked time-dependent increase in the uptake of sialic acid is seen in cells expressing plasma membrane targeted sialin compared with cells expressing another lysosomal transporter protein, LYAAT1 (Fig. 3, A and B). The activity is saturable with a Km of ∼0.8 mm, which is similar to, but slightly higher than, the value reported for the uptake of sialic acid into lysosomes (Fig. 3C). Sialic acid uptake is not affected by switching to a Na+- and Cl--free MES-buffered sucrose solution (data not shown), indicating that the activity is not dependent on, or inhibited by, either of these ions. However, uptake is reduced by two known inhibitors of lysosomal sialic acid uptake, glucuronic acid and DIDS (Fig. 3D). A large pH gradient exists across the lysosomal membrane and several lysosomal transport systems, including the sialic acid transport system, are coupled to this gradient. To determine the role of pH in the activity of the recombinant protein, both the pH of the buffer solution and the pH gradient across the plasma membrane were varied. Increasing the buffer pH from 5.5 to 6.5 markedly decreases sialin mediated transport, and essentially no transport is detected when the extracellular solution is buffered at approximately the same pH as the cytoplasm (pH 7.5) (Fig. 3E). In addition, uptake is reduced by ∼80% at pH 5.5 by abolishing the pH gradient with nigericin, an ionophore that mediates H+/K+ exchange (Fig. 3F). On the other hand, transport activity is not affected by specific dissipation of the electrical gradient using the K+ ionophore valinomycin, suggesting that transport is electroneutral. A Subset of Mutations Is Associated with Residual Transport Activity—After confirming that sialin is a sialic acid transporter, we next sought to determine whether mutations associated with disease alter the intrinsic transport activity of the protein. To do this, we disrupted the putative AP-binding domain of proteins containing the disease-associated mutations (R39C, K136E, H183R, P334R, G371V, and Δ268–272(SSLRN)). This leads to plasma membrane expression of all of the proteins with the exception of G371V, as indicated by the pattern of immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 4A) and cell surface biotinylation (data not shown). Measuring total uptake at 5 min (Fig. 4B) demonstrates that the transport activity of the R39C and K136E mutants is reduced. Whereas, essentially no transport activity can be detected for the other mutants (H183R, P334R, G371V, and Δ268–272(SSLRN)). The absence of measurable activity associated with the H183R and P334R mutations and the short deletion despite plasma membrane expression strongly suggests that these mutations abolish transporter activity. However, since G371V is not present at detectable levels on the plasma membrane, with this approach we cannot determine whether the mutation influences the intrinsic transport activity of the protein. Although a partial reduction in transport activity could lead to disease, the absence of a phenotype in heterozygote carriers of the free sialic acid storage disorders, who have approximately half the normal lysosomal sialic acid transport activity (27Mancini G.M. Beerens C.E. Aula P.P. Verheijen F.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1329-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), suggests that activity would need to be reduced by more than 50%. Therefore, we wanted to know, more precisely, the effect of the R39C and K136E mutations on activity. To accomplish this, we analyzed sialic acid uptake relative to the amount of biotinylated cell surface protein expresssion. For both mutants, uptake and plasma membrane expression were determined relative to transfected wild-type protein. Normalizing relative uptake to relative biotinylated cell surface expression demonstrates that both the Salla mutation and the K136E mutation retain only about 10% of their intrinsic transport activity (Fig. 4C). The G371V Mutation Leads to Retention of Sialin in the ER—In a previous report in which the localization of sialin was compared with LAMP1, a lysosomal/late endosomal marker, recombinant proteins with the Salla mutation and the short deletion were found to be mislocalized, leading the authors to suggest that improper targeting could contribute to the defect associated with these mutations (29Aula N. Jalanko A. Aula P. Peltonen L. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2002; 77: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In trying to determine the extent to which other mutations influence trafficking of sialin we found that wild-type sialin only partially localizes with LAMP1 and LAMP2 in HeLa cells (data not shown), suggesting that colocalization studies with these endogenous antigens would be difficult. Therefore, to determine whether mutations affect trafficking we compared wild-type and mutant proteins expressed in the same cell using differential epitope tagging. As expected, simultaneous expression of HA-tagged and Myc-tagged wild-type sialin leads to colocalization of the two epitopes by immunofluoresence staining (Fig. 5A). Analysis of cells cotransfected with Myc-tagged wild-type sialin and HA-tagged R39C mutant demonstrates a predominant staining pattern of complete overlap with only rare cells with partial overlap (Fig. 5A). This colocalization is independent of expression levels or time after transfection (data not shown). Similar colocalization with the wild-type protein is seen with other mutants including K136E, H183R, P334R, and the short deletion (Fig. 5A). A striking differential localization is only seen for G371V. This mutant colocalizes with PDI, an endoplasmic reticulum protein, suggesting retention in this compartment (Fig. 5B). Interestingly the combination of G371V with the disrupted putative AP-binding domain also colocalizes with PDI (data not shown), consistent with sialin interacting with an adaptor protein in a post-ER compartment.

The pathogenic mechanisms and the subcellular sites of the conversion are complex and not completely understood. In particular, little is known on the role of the early compartment of the secretory pathway in the processing of PrPC and in the pathogenesis of prion diseases. In order to interfere with the intracellular traffic of endogenous PrPC we have generated two anti-prion single chain antibody fragments (scFv) directed against different epitopes, each fragment tagged either with a secretory leader or with the ER retention signal KDEL. The stable expression of these constructs in PC12 cells allowed us to study their specific effects on the synthesis, maturation, and processing of endogenous PrPC and on PrPSc formation. We found that ER-targeted anti-prion scFvs retain PrPC in the ER and inhibit its translocation to the cell surface. Retention in the ER strongly affects the maturation and glycosylation state of PrPC, with the appearance of a new aberrant endo-H sensitive glycosylated species. Interestingly, ER-trapped PrPC acquires detergent insolubility and proteinase K resistance. Furthermore, we show that ER-targeted anti-prion antibodies prevent PrPSc accumulation in nerve growth factor-differentiated PC12 cells, providing a new tool to study the molecular pathology of prion diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1987637867,"In Neisseria meningitidis and related bacterial pathogens, sialic acids play critical roles in mammalian cell immunity evasion and are synthesized by a conserved enzymatic pathway that includes sialic acid synthase (NeuB, SiaC, or SynC). NeuB catalyzes the condensation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and N-acetylmannosamine, directly forming N-acetylneuraminic acid (or sialic acid). In this paper we report the development of a coupled assay to monitor NeuB reaction kinetics and an 18O-labeling study that demonstrates the synthase operates via a C—O bond cleavage mechanism. We also report the first structure of a sialic acid synthase, that of NeuB, revealing a unique domain-swapped homodimer architecture consisting of a (β/α)8 barrel (TIM barrel)-type fold at the N-terminal end and a domain with high sequence identity and structural similarity to the ice binding type III antifreeze proteins at the C-terminal end of the enzyme. We have determined the structures of NeuB in the malate-bound form and with bound PEP and the substrate analog N-acetylmannosaminitol to 1.9 and 2.2 A resolution, respectively. Typical of other TIM barrel proteins, the active site of NeuB is located in a cavity at the C-terminal end of the barrel; however, the positioning of the swapped antifreeze-like domain from the adjacent monomer provides key residues for hydrogen bonding with substrates in the active site of NeuB, a structural feature that leads to distinct modes of substrate binding from other PEP-utilizing enzymes that lack an analogous antifreeze-like domain. Our observation of a direct interaction between a highly ordered manganese and the N-acetylmannosaminitol in the NeuB active site also suggests an essential role for the ion as an electrophilic catalyst that activates the N-acetylmannosamine carbonyl to the addition of PEP."
https://openalex.org/W2000131429,"p21-activated kinase (Pak)-interacting exchange factor (Pix), a Rho family guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), has been shown to co-localize with Pak and form activated Cdc42- and Rac1-driven focal complexes. In this study we have presented evidence that treatment of human mesangial cells (HMC) with endothelin 1 (ET-1) and stimulation of adenylate cyclase with either forskolin or with the cAMP analog 8-Br-cAMP activated the GTP loading of Cdc42. Transient expression of constitutively active Gαs also stimulated Cdc42. In addition, overexpression of β1Pix enhanced ET-1-induced Cdc42 activation, whereas the expression of β1Pix SH3m(W43K), which lacks the ability to bind Pak, and β1PixDHm(L238R/L239S), which lacks GEF activity, decreased ET-1-induced Cdc42 activation. Furthermore, ET-1 stimulation induced β1Pix translocation to focal complexes. Interestingly, pretreatment of HMC with protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitors blocked both Cdc42 activation and β1Pix translocation induced by ET-1, indicating the involvement of the PKA pathway. Through site-directed mutagenesis studies of consensus PKA phosphorylation sites and in vitro PKA kinase assay, we have shown that β1Pix is phosphorylated by PKA. Using purified recombinant β1Pix(wt) and β1Pix mutants, we have identified Ser-516 and Thr-526 as the major phosphorylation sites by PKA. β1Pix(S516A/T526A), in which both phosphorylation sites are replaced by alanine, blocks β1Pix translocation and Cdc42 activation.

Mesangial cells are smooth muscle-like cells situated within the renal glomerulus that play an important role in regulating glomerular filtration and function, both by contraction and release of proinflammatory substances.

ET release is increased in response to inflammatory cytokines, suggesting that ET-1 synthesis might increase in glomerulonephritis by intrinsic glomerular cells such as glomerular endothelial, mesangial, and epithelial cells (1Yoshimura A.

Two receptors for ET isopeptides, ETA and ETB, are G protein-coupled receptors with seven transmembrane domains (2Arai H. Hori S. Aramori I. Ohkubo H. Nakanishi S.

Hypertension. 1996; 27: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and induces active cytoskeletal rearrangement. This process is governed largely by the precise temporal and spatial modulation of small GTPase proteins of the Rho family, Cdc42, Rac, and RhoA. Cdc42 and Rac1 function as molecular switches (6Aspenstrom P. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 20-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 7Mackay D.J. Hall A. J. Biol.

They are converted from the GDP-bound inactive form to a GTP-bound active state by a reaction catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) (8Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1761) Google Scholar). Since their identification, GEFs have become increasingly involved in mediating the effects of G protein-coupled receptor agonists. Recently, a Cdc42/Rac-GEF termed Pix (Pak-interacting exchange factor) was identified (9Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G. Zhao Z.S. Chen X.Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Pix has a diffuse B cell lymphoma homology (DH) domain and a flanking pleckstrin homology domain, which are conserved in all of the GEFs for Rho GTPases. Pix family proteins consist of two isoforms, αPix and βPix, and recently a new splice variant of βPix designated β2Pix has been identified (10Koh C.G. Manser E. Zhao Z.S. Ng C.P. Lim L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4239-4251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The human Pix family bind tightly through an N-terminal SH3 domain to a conserved proline-rich Pak sequence located at the C terminus and are colocalized with Pak to form activated Cdc42- and Rac1-driven focal complexes (9Manser E.

Recently, Pix has been shown to form a trimolecular complex with Pak1 and p95PKL (also known as G protein-coupled receptor kinase-interacting target, GIT1) (11Ku G.M. Yablonski D. Manser E. Lim L. Weiss A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Furthermore, tyrosine-phosphorylated p95PKL can also bind paxillin (12Bagrodia S. Bailey D. Lenard Z. Hart M. Guan J.L.

The presence of several domains allows Pix to interact with a variety of signaling proteins and suggests that Pix might have an important role in mediating the effects of extracellular signals (2Arai H.

The physiological and pathological responses elicited in mesangial cells ultimately require changes in the cytoskeletal organization whose architecture is modulated by the Rho family proteins. Therefore, understanding the signal transduction pathways associated with the activation of Rho family GTPase by ET and its regulation by β1Pix is of pivotal importance in delineating the effects of ET on cytoskeletal organization in mesangial cells. Cell Culture and Transfection—All materials for cell culturing were purchased from Invitrogen. Previously characterized SV40-transformed human mesangial cells (HMC) (18Sraer J.D. Delarue F. Hagege J. Feunteun J. Pinet F. Nguyen G. Rondeau E. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 267-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in a 37 °C humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Transient transfection of cells with mammalian expression vectors was performed using Lipofectamine™ 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA isolated from rat mesangial cells was reverse transcribed using Superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), oligo(dT) primers (Invitrogen), and deoxynucleotide triphosphate as specified by the manufacturer. β1Pix was amplified by PCR with TITANIUM™ Taq polymerase (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) in the presence of deoxynucleotide triphosphate, the forward primer 5′-GGAATTCCATGACTGATAACGCCAACAGCCAA-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GCTCTAGAGCTAGATTGGTCTCATCCCAAGCAGG-3′. The PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis in a 1% acrylamide gel, and the results were visualized with a Bio Imaging analyzer. The β1Pix cDNA was cut with EcoRI and XbaI and inserted into the EcoRI-XbaI site of pcDNA3.1/Myc-His vector. β1Pix Mutants—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The following mutagenic primers were used: β1Pix SH3m (W43K), 5′-GTGGAGGAAGGAGGCaaGTGGGAGGGCACACACAATGGC-3′ and 5′-GCCATTGTGTGTGCCTTCCCACttGCCTCCTTCCTCCAC-3′; β1Pix DHm (L238R/L239S), 5′-CATGTGTCTCTCCAGCTCCTTCgatcGTGTGGGGTACTTG-3′ and 5′-CAAGTACCCCACACgatcGAAGGAGCTGGAGAGACACATG-3′. The β1Pix mutant β1Pix(S516A) was generated by mutagenic PCR using sense (5′-CCCGAGCGCAAGCCTgCAGACGAGGAGTTCGCTGTGCG-3′) and antisense (5′-CGCACAGCGAACTCCTCGTCTGcAGGGTTGCGCTCGGG-3′). The β1Pix mutant β1Pix(T526A) was generated by mutagenic PCR using sense (5′-GCTGTGCGCAAGAGCgCAGCCGCTCTGGAGGAAGACGC-3′) and antisense (5′-GCGTCTTCCTCCAGAGCGGCTGcGCTCTTGCGCACAGC-3′). Mismatches are indicated by lowercase letters. The mutation was verified by automatic DNA sequencing (Applied Biosystem). Purification of Recombinant β1Pix and Its Mutants—β1Pix, β1Pix(S516A), β1Pix(T526A), and β1Pix(S516A/T526A) were expressed as N-terminal His6 tag fusion proteins in bacteria (BL21DE3). Recombinant proteins expressed in bacteria were purified using the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid purification system (Invitrogen). Recombinant proteins were eluted from the resin with 250 mm imidazole at room temperature. Pulldown Assays of Rho Family GTPases—Cells were transfected with empty vector, Myc-tagged β1Pix, or its mutants for 24 h. After stimulation with ET-1, cells were lysed in lysis/wash buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal CA-630, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1% glycerol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). To measure the active GTP-bound form of Rho family GTPases in the cell lysates, we performed pulldown assays (Cytoskeleton) using recombinant GST-tagged Pak-1·PBD (for Cdc42 and Rac1) and Rhetokin-RBD (for RhoA). Aliquots (500 μg) of the supernatants mixed with glutathione-agarose with 10 μg of GST·Pak-1·PBD or 10 μg of GST·RBD were precipitated by centrifugation. Complexes were boiled in a Laemmli sample buffer and then separated on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The separated proteins were immunoblotted using each antibody against Rho family small GTPases. In Vitro Kinase Assay—The β1Pix-bound beads were resuspended in 80 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.015% Tween 20) and incubated with 30 units of protein kinase A catalytic subunit (Sigma), 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 30 min. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times. The beads were then suspended in Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, Coomassie Blue staining, and autoradiography. For recombinant β1Pix and its mutants, 5 μg were used in the kinase reaction as described above. Measurement of cAMP—A Biotrack cAMP enzyme immunoassay kit (Amersham Biosciences) was used to measure cyclic AMP levels in HMC according to the manufacturer's instructions. PKA Assay—SignaTECT®cAMP-dependent PKA assay (Promega) was used to measure PKA enzyme activity according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 20 μl of substrate mixture containing 100 μm kemptide peptide, 5 μm cAMP, and 5 μg of cell lysate were added in order. Then the reaction was started by adding 5 μl of the mixture containing 0.5 mm ATP and 10 μCi/μl of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol). After incubation, 10 μl of the mixture was spotted onto streptavidin-coated membrane, washed repeatedly, dried, and placed in scintillation vials for radioactive counting. Immunocytochemistry—100-mm dish-cultured human glomerular mesangial cells were transfected with 10 μg of plasmid containing either wild type or mutant β1Pix. The following day, transfected cells were seeded on glass coverslips housed in a 12-well plate, where all subsequent incubations were performed. After overnight serum starvation, cells were stimulated with ET-1, washed in PBS, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. Cells were then washed, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, and incubated in 10% goat serum in PBS for 30 min. Primary antibodies against c-Myc and paxillin (Santa Cruz) were diluted 1:500 and incubated with cells for 1 h. Cells were washed several times with PBS, followed by a 1-h incubation with Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 546 secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) diluted 1:1000. Cells were equilibrated and mounted in ProLong anti-fade reagent (Molecular Probes). Cells were visualized under a fluorescent microscope (E600; Nikon) and photographed using the SPOT system (Diagnostic Instruments). Cells of roughly equal and average fluorescent intensity were chosen as comparative examples. ET-1 Stimulates Cdc42 in Human Mesangial Cells—We first sought to determine whether Cdc42 is activated by ET-1 in HMC. Using a pulldown assay to separate the activated GTP-bound form of Cdc42, we found that treatment of HMC with ET-1 induced the formation of the GTP-bound form of Cdc42 (Fig. 1A). ET-1 stimulates Cdc42 in a dose- and time-dependent manner, peaking at 2 min, and this activation decreases 10 min after stimulation (Fig. 1B). The dependence of Cdc42 stimulation on ET-1 concentration was determined at 5 min. Maximal stimulation was observed at a concentration of 100 nm ET-1. To confirm that ET-1 specifically stimulates Cdc42, HMC were pretreated with 10 ng/ml of Clostridium difficile toxin B, which glycosylates and inactivates Rho family proteins (19Prepens U. Just I. Hofmann F. Aktories K. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 419: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), and then stimulated with ET-1. As shown in Fig. 1C, toxin B completely inhibited ET-1-induced Cdc42 stimulation. We also found that ET-1 induced RhoA stimulation (Fig. 1D). However, ET-1-induced stimulation of Rac1 was not observed (data not shown). Effect of β1Pix Overexpression on ET-1-induced Cdc42 Activation—Pix family proteins are GEFs for small GTPase proteins Cdc42/Rac (9Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G. Zhao Z.S. Chen X.Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar) and have been shown to signal via these proteins. Therefore, we studied the effect of β1Pix and its inactive mutants on ET-1-induced Cdc42 activation in HMC. In our experiments, Cdc42 activation was measured after ET-1 treatment of HMC-overexpressing wild type rat β1Pix or its mutants, β1Pix SH3m(W43K) and β1Pix DHm(L238R/L239S) (9Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G. Zhao Z.S. Chen X.Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, ET-1 induced Cdc42 activation in cells expressing empty vector, and this activation was enhanced by β1Pix overexpression. By contrast, mutated β1Pix DHm-(L238R/L239S), which lacks GEF activity, and SH3 domain-mutated β1Pix SH3m(W43K), which lacks the ability to bind to Pak, decreased ET-1-induced Cdc42 activation (Fig. 2A). The expression of β1Pix alone in the absence of ET-1 stimulation had no effect on Cdc42 activity (data not shown). Fig. 2B shows quantitative analysis of the results obtained by densitometry. β1Pix overexpression did not enhance ET-1-induced RhoA activation (data not shown), indicating that β1Pix specifically regulates the activation of Cdc42 by ET-1 in HMC.Fig. 2β1Pix increases ET-1-induced Cdc42 activation.A, HMC were co-transfected with empty vector alone, Myc-tagged β1Pix (WT), or β1Pix mutants W43K or L238R/L239S. After 24 h of transfection, cells were stimulated with ET-1 (100 nm) for 5 min and active Cdc42 was measured. B, quantitative analysis of the results obtained by densitometry. The data represent the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Role of PKA in Stimulation of Cdc42 by ET-1—To determine the enzyme(s) involved in the regulation of Cdc42 activation by ET-1, we utilized different pharmacological inhibitors such as PKC inhibitor Ro31-7549, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin, PKA inhibitor H-89, and PP2, a Src kinase inhibitor. We found that only H-89, a selective PKA inhibitor, blocked Cdc42 activation induced by ET-1 (Fig. 3A). The inhibitory effect of H-89 was confirmed using a myristoylated, cell-permeable peptide derivative of the naturally occurring PKA inhibitor, PKI (Fig. 3B). PKA is activated in response to cAMP generated by adenylate cyclase. To investigate the role of PKA in Cdc42 activation, HMC were stimulated either by ET-1, cAMP analog 8-Br-cAMP, or by the adenylate cyclase activator, forskolin. Cells transiently expressing the constitutively active α-subunit of Gs served as positive control to mimic receptor-mediated activation of adenylate cyclase. Fig. 4A shows that ET-1 stimulated Cdc42 to a level similar to those produced by stimulating PKA, either by 8-Br-cAMP or forskolin or by expressing the constitutively active GαsQL. Treatment of the cells with H-89 inhibited Cdc42 activation induced by ET-1 and all other agonists mentioned above. These results indicate that Cdc42 activation in response to ET-1 requires PKA activity. We next wondered whether ET-1 is able to stimulate cAMP increase, which in turn activates PKA enzyme in the cells. In the presence of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, ET-1 induced a maximum of 2.5-fold cAMP accumulation over the basal level at 50 nm and higher concentrations (Fig. 4B). Next, we sought to determine whether ET-1 would stimulate PKA activity. Results show that stimulation by ET-1 (100 nm) increases PKA activity by 2-fold over non-stimulated cells (Fig. 4C). Cells expressing constitutively active GαsQL also showed an increase in PKA activity. In both cases the stimulated PKA activity was inhibited by H-89 to the basal level. Taken together, these results demonstrate that (i) activation of Gs and increase in intracellular cAMP lead to the stimulation of Cdc42, and (ii) activation of PKA plays an important role in the regulation of ET-1-mediated stimulation of Cdc42.Fig. 4ET-1 induces cAMP increase and PKA activation.A, HMC were treated with vehicle or H-89 for 30 min and then stimulated with ET-1 (100 nm), forskolin (20 μm), or 8-Br-cAMP (20 μm) for 5 min. Activated Cdc42 was determined by affinity precipitation with Pak-1·PBD followed by Western blotting with anti-Cdc42. B, cells were stimulated by different concentrations of ET-1, and cAMP increase was measured in the presence of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (300 μm) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” C, cells were stimulated by ET-1 (100 nm) in the presence or absence of H-89, and PKA enzyme activity was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells expressing the constitutively active mutant of Gαs were incubated with vehicle only. Data are representative of four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Identification of PKA Phosphorylation Sites on β1Pix—The functional activity of Cdc42 is known to be regulated by β1Pix, which controls its GDP/GTP-bound state. The fact that PKA inhibitors H-89 and PKI both blocked ET-1-induced Cdc42 activation prompted us to examine whether β1Pix was phosphorylated by PKA. Upon examination of the β1Pix amino acid sequence, we found two potential phosphorylation sites based on the PKA consensus sequence represented by RKXS/T. Interestingly, both potential PKA phosphorylation sites, Ser-516 and Thr-526, are highly conserved in αPix, β1Pix, and β2Pix, suggesting that these residues may be of functional significance. To test whether Ser-516 or Thr-526 is phosphorylated by PKA, mutants of β1Pix were produced in which Ser-516 or Thr-526, or both, were changed to Ala by site-directed mutagenesis. In these experiments, Myc-tagged β1Pix(wt), β1Pix(S516A), β1Pix(T526A), and β1Pix(S516A/T526A) were immunoprecipitated from transiently transfected HMC using anti-c-Myc antibody. In vitro kinase assays were performed using the purified catalytic subunit of PKA and β1Pix immunocomplex or its mutants as substrates. As shown in Fig. 5A, PKA strongly phosphorylates wild type β1Pix (lane 2) and β1Pix(T526A) (lane 4), has a slight effect on β1Pix(S516A) (lane 3), and almost no effect on β1Pix(S516A/T526A) (lane 5). β1Pix is not phosphorylated in the absence of PKA catalytic subunit (lane 6), indicating that PKA specifically phosphorylates β1Pix. No phosphorylation was observed when control IgG was used for immunoprecipitation (lane 7). To further confirm that β1Pix is a direct target for PKA phosphorylation in vitro, we performed an in vitro kinase assay using purified recombinant β1Pix and its mutants as substrate. Autoradiography of reaction products showed that recombinant β1Pix(wt) was phosphorylated by PKA (Fig. 5B, lane 1). Substitution of Ser-516, Thr-526, or both to Ala strongly reduced phosphorylation as compared with β1Pix(wt). Slight residual phosphorylation suggested that an additional residue could be targeted by PKA under these optimal conditions. Coomassie staining of gels demonstrated comparable loading of proteins (Fig. 4, lower panels). The apparent discrepancy between the ability of PKA to phosphorylate immunoprecipitated β1Pix(T526A) (Fig. 5A, lane 4) and not recombinant β1Pix(T526A) (Fig. 5B, lane 3) suggests the presence of other residues phosphorylated by PKA or the presence of endogenous Pak in the immunoprecipitate. Indeed, β1Pix is a well known target for Pak phosphorylation (10Koh C.G. Manser E. Zhao Z.S. Ng C.P. Lim L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4239-4251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In conclusion, our results show for the first time that Ser-516 and Thr-526 are the major in vitro phosphorylation sites by PKA on β1Pix. β1Pix Phosphorylation by PKA Mediates ET-1- and cAMP-induced Cdc42 Activation—To determine whether β1Pix phosphorylation at Ser-516 and Thr-526 has a functional significance, we investigated the effect of β1Pix double mutant β1Pix(S516A/T526A) on Cdc42 activation by ET-1. We hypothesized that β1Pix(S516A/T526A) is a biologically inactive mutant and therefore will inhibit ET-1-induced Cdc42 activation. To specifically measure the effect of β1Pix and its mutant on Cdc42 activity, we co-transfected HMC with HA-tagged Cdc42 and either Myc-tagged β1Pix or Myc-tagged β1Pix(S516A/T526A). The co-transfection enabled us to increase the sensitivity of measuring activated Cdc42 only in the cells expressing both β1Pix and Cdc42, given the transient nature of transfection used. In this assay we detected GST·PBD bound to active HA-Cdc42 by immunoblotting with anti-HA tag antibody instead of using anti-Cdc42. Consistent with our previous results, ET-1 treatment induced Cdc42 activation (Fig. 6A). The Cdc42 activation was greatly increased in cells co-expressing HA-Cdc42 and β1Pix. However, in cells co-expressing HA-Cdc42 and β1Pix(S516A/T526A), activation of Cdc42 was completely inhibited in response to ET-1 (Fig. 6A). To demonstrate a direct role of β1Pix in mediating cAMP-induced Cdc42 activation, we investigated the effect of 8-Br-cAMP on Cdc42 activity in HMC co-expressing β1Pix(wt) or its double mutant, β1Pix(S516A/T526A), and HA-Cdc42 as indicated above. Transfection of HMC with β1Pix(S516A/T526A) inhibited Cdc42 activation induced by 8-Br-cAMP (Fig. 6B) as it did for ET-1 stimulation (Fig. 6A). However, cells expressing β1Pix(wt) show an increase of Cdc42 activation by 8-br-cAMP compared with cells expressing empty vector (Fig. 6B). The pattern of Cdc42 stimulation by 8-Br-cAMP is comparable with Cdc42 stimulation by ET-1 (Fig. 6A). The mutation of either Ser-516 or Thr-526 alone did not inhibit ET-1- or 8-Br-cAMP-induced Cdc42 activation (data not shown). Altogether, these results indicate that β1Pix(S516A/T526A) is a biologically inactive mutant of β1Pix and that Cdc42 activity is regulated through a PKA phosphorylation-dependent pathway. PKA-dependent Translocation of β1Pix to Focal Complexes—It has been shown that β1Pix·Pak complex co-localizes to focal complexes where p95PKL plays a role in mediating the association of β1Pix with paxillin (9Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G. Zhao Z.S. Chen X.Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 13Turner C.E. Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Riedy M.C. Nikolopoulos S.N. McDonald A.R. Bagrodia S. Thomas S. Leventhal P.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 851-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Expression and localization of Myc-tagged β1Pix were analyzed under a fluorescent microscope using anti-c-Myc antibody. Having found that H-89 inhibited Cdc42 activation induced by ET-1, we examined its effect on ET-1-induced β1Pix translocation to focal complexes. The control cells show a diffuse distribution of β1Pix throughout the cytosol (Fig. 7a). ET-1 treatment induced β1Pix translocation to focal complexes (Fig. 7, b and c) that co-localized with paxillin (Fig. 7, lower panels). Pretreatment of HMC with 10 μm H-89 (Fig. 7d) or with 1 μm PKI (Fig. 7f) for 30 min completely inhibits ET-1-induced β1Pix translocation to focal complexes. PKI alone has no effect on β1Pix distribution (Fig. 7e). Altogether, these results indicate that ET-1-induced β1Pix translocation is dependent on PKA activity. The next step was to determine whether the phosphorylation of Ser-516 and Thr-526 residues is important for β1Pix translocation. To this end we compared the targeting of β1Pix wild type with that of double mutant β1Pix(S516A/T526A). The unstimulated cells expressing β1Pix(S516A/T526A) show a comparable distribution (Fig. 7g) as unstimulated cells expressing β1Pix wild type (Fig. 7a). However, in ET-1-stimulated cells the translocation of β1Pix(S516A/T526A) was strongly inhibited (Fig. 7h), indicating that the phosphorylation of these two residues is functionally important to β1Pix complex translocation to the focal complexes. The mutation of either Ser-516 or Thr-526 alone did not inhibit β1Pix translocation after ET-1 stimulation (data not shown). In the present study, we have reported for the first time that ET-1 stimulates the GTPase Cdc42 by a β1Pix-mediated, PKA-dependent pathway. Moreover, we have demonstrated that ET-1-induced β1Pix translocation also requires PKA activity. Many G protein-coupled receptor agonists activate small GTPases that, in turn, regulate a variety of biological responses such as cell differentiation and growth (2Arai H. Hori S. Aramori I. Ohkubo H. Nakanishi S. Nature. 1990; 348: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (2512) Google Scholar). Our results have shown that ET-1 stimulates Cdc42 and RhoA but fails to stimulate Rac1. A critical role for Cdc42 in ET-1 signaling is further supported by recent findings (20Miyamoto Y. Yamauchi J. Itoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29890-29900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) showing that ET-1 stimulates Cdc42, but not Rac1, in human kidney epithelial cells. PKA is involved in ET-1-induced Cdc42 activation because PKA inhibitors blocked Cdc42 stimulation. Our results demonstrating ET-1-induced cAMP increase and activation of PKA suggest that ET-1 activates Cdc42 via cAMP production by a Gαs-dependent pathway. Indeed, we found that stimulation of adenylate cyclase by forskolin, or loading of HMC with the cAMP analog 8-Br-cAMP, induced Cdc42 activation. Furthermore, the expression of constitutively active Gαs induced Cdc42 activation. The data presented here show cross-talk between cAMP and Cdc42. It is unknown how widespread this phenomenon is, but previous study showed that Cdc42 activation by cAMP occurs in human mast cells, Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells, and COS-7 cells (21Feoktistov I. Goldstein A.E. Biaggioni I. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 903-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Our finding that cAMP can activate Cdc42 extends the spectrum of possible pathways involved in transducing a signal from G protein-coupled receptor to Cdc42. The activity of small GTPase proteins is regulated by GEFs that modulate their GDP/GTP-bound state. It is well established now that upon activation Cdc42 and Rac 1 bind to Pak and form an active complex that regulates several signaling pathways, including cytoskeletal rearrangement (22Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M. Bokoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 23Amano M. Mukai H. Ono Y. Chihara K. Matsui T. Hamajima Y. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 271: 648-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 24Hall A. Annu. Rev.

To further examine the mechanism involved in the regulation of Cdc42 stimulation, we investigated the role of the Cdc42/Rac1-GEF, β1Pix, in ET-1-induced Cdc42 activation in HMC. Using β1Pix and its double mutant, β1Pix(L238R/L239S), we showed that β1Pix acts upstream of Cdc42 and provides a key link between ET-1 receptor and Cdc42. In addition, we confirmed a direct role of PKA by establishing β1Pix as an in vitro substrate of PKA at Ser-516 and Thr-526. The mutation of both residues inhibited Cdc42 activation and β1Pix translocation. However, the mutation of a single residue does not have functional importance. Thr-526 is also phosphorylated by Pak (9Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G. Zhao Z.S. Chen X.Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar), which makes this residue a molecular convergent point for PKA and Pak. Furthermore, inhibition of PKA blocks ET-1-induced β1Pix translocation to focal complexes (Fig. 7d). This has prompted us to speculate that phosphorylation of β1Pix by PKA is the mechanism by which β1Pix complex is recruited to focal complexes where it binds p95PKL (13Turner C.E. Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Riedy M.C. Nikolopoulos S.N. McDonald A.R. Bagrodia S. Thomas S. Leventhal P.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 851-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). PKA phosphorylation of β1Pix could also accomplish Cdc42 activation by bringing β1Pix within the vicinity of its target Cdc42, as seen in the case of the Ras exchange factor Sos, which is brought to the membrane by binding to Grb2, thereby enabling Ras activation (26McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 363: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 27Aronheim A. Engelberg D. al Li N. Alawi N. Schlessinger J. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 78: 949-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The inhibition of PKA by H-89 or the expression of β1Pix double mutant β1Pix(S516A/T526A) induced a complete inhibition of Cdc42 activation by ET-1 or cAMP analog (Fig. 6), which confirms the functional role of β1Pix phosphorylation by PKA. Moreover, the expression of β1Pix(S516A/T526A) results in a very strong inhibition of β1Pix translocation induced by ET-1 (Fig. 7f). This result indicates that phosphorylation by PKA may induce conformational changes in β1Pix that facilitate or stabilize β1Pix complex formation that allow its proper targeting. Previous studies have shown that the stimulation of extracellular signal-related kinase pathway in PC12 cells induces Pak2·β1Pix complex translocation through phosphorylation of β1Pix on Ser-525 and Thr-526 (28Shin E.Y. Shin K.S. Lee C.S. Woo K.N. Quan S.H. Soung N.K. Kim Y.G. Cha C.I. Kim S.R. Park D. Bokoch G.M. Kim E.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 1994-2004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, in these studies Pix translocation was found to occur independently of Rac1 activation. Considering that Pak acts downstream of PKA, the phosphorylation of β1Pix by PKA might provide the first step before Pak phosphorylation provides the signal for β1Pix complex to be recruited to focal complexes. β1Pix is usually associated with a multicomplex of proteins binding to paxillin and Pak, an effector of Cdc42 function associated with filopodia formation (30Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 350-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 31Daniels R.H. Bokoch G.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 350-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). This complex is linked to paxillin through an ADP-ribosylation factor GAP protein, p95PKL (13Turner C.E. Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Riedy M.C. Nikolopoulos S.N. McDonald A.R. Bagrodia S. Thomas S. Leventhal P.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 851-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Although ADP-ribosylation factor GTPases play a critical role in vesicle transport, they have been involved in regulating the actin cytoskeleton (32Song J. Khachikian Z. Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2257-2267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the translocation to the plasma membrane of focal adhesion proteins such as paxillin (33Norman J.C. Jones D. Barry S.T. Holt M.R. Cockcroft S. Critchley D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1981-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Alignments between different Pix isoforms show that Ser-516 and Thr-526 are highly conserved, indicating that these residues may have a functional importance in the formation of these signaling complexes. The physiological significance of β1Pix phosphorylation remains unclear. Increasing evidence indicates that phosphorylation is an important mechanism of regulation of GEFs of the diffuse B cell lymphoma family. Although it has been shown that the phosphorylation status of β1Pix has no effect on its GEF activity (9Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G. Zhao Z.S. Chen X.Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar), recent findings show that the activation of Rac1 is dependent on β1Pix phosphorylation (29Shin E.Y. Woo K.N. Lee C.S. Koo S.H. Kim Y.G. Kim W.J. Bae C.D. Chang S.I. Kim E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1994-2004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We can speculate that PKA regulation of Cdc42 activation through phosphorylation of β1Pix may have an important consequence for regulating mesangial cell migration. Indeed, it has been shown that increased Cdc42 activity results in increased cell motility (34Crean J.K. Furlong F. Finlay D. Mitchell D. Conway B. Brady H.R. Godson C. Martin F. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1541-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). During initial stages of mesangial cell migration new protrusions are formed at the leading edge of the cell. It can be hypothesized that PKA amplifies Cdc42 activation through β1Pix phosphorylation, resulting in the initiation of microspike formation and cell protrusion. This scenario implies that activated Cdc42 is localized at the leading edge of migrating cells. In summary, our findings describe a new ET-1 receptor-initiated pathway that involves the activation of cAMP/PKA pathway and results in the activation of β1Pix translocation and Cdc42; the findings identify important venues for future work regarding the role of this pathway in mesangial cell migration."

Despite a wealth of structural studies on amyloids, the nature of the amyloid structure remains elusive; possible connections to natural, β-structured fibrous motifs have been suggested. In this work we focus on understanding amyloid structure and formation from sequences of a natural, β-structured fibrous protein. We show that short peptides (25 to 6 amino acids) corresponding to repetitive sequences from the adenovirus fiber shaft have an intrinsic capacity to form amyloid fibrils as judged by electron microscopy, Congo Red binding, infrared spectroscopy, and x-ray fiber diffraction. In the presence of the globular C-terminal domain of the protein that acts as a trimerization motif, the shaft sequences adopt a triple-stranded, β-fibrous motif. We discuss the possible structure and arrangement of these sequences within the amyloid fibril, as compared with the one adopted within the native structure. A 6-amino acid peptide, corresponding to the last β-strand of the shaft, was found to be sufficient to form amyloid fibrils. Structural analysis of these amyloid fibrils suggests that perpendicular stacking of β-strand repeat units is an underlying common feature of amyloid formation.

The aggregation of proteins and peptides into the amyloid-type, β-sheet structures is currently the subject of intense investigation by many laboratories. Amyloid fibrils derive from a wide spectrum of native proteins with no structure or sequence homology (1Dobson C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 329-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1702) Google Scholar). Despite the diversity of sequences and folds in these proteins, the amyloid structures that can form from them are very similar. All are of the “cross-β” type with β-strands lying perpendicular to the fibril axis (2Blake C. Serpell L.

A number of recent papers suggest that the amyloid motif could be similar to the β-helical folding motifs described for elongated proteins such as the phage P22 tailspike and pectate lyase (6Lazo N.D. Downing D.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1731-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 7Wille H. Michelitsch M.D. Guenebaut V. Supattapone S. Serban A. Cohen F.E. Agard D.A. Prusiner S.B. Proc.

Such fibrous proteins are often large and complex molecules that contain repetitive sequences and a high degree of structural regularity. In addition to the β-helical folds described for pectate lyase and the tailspike protein (9Jenkins J. Pickersgill R. Prog. Biophys. Mol.

However, little is known on the folding and assembly mechanisms of these natural, β-structured fibrous proteins. The P22 tailspike protein remains the most extensively studied model system providing fundamental understanding on the folding of β-helical structures (15Betts S. King J. Struct. Fold Des. 1999; 7: R131-R139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The work described here focuses on folding and assembly of shaft sequences from the fiber protein of adenoviruses. These fibers protrude from the 5-fold vertices of the adenovirus virion and are the cell attachment points of the virus. They are thin fibrous trimers with an asymmetric morphology, namely an N-terminal part that binds to the viral capsid, a thin shaft, and a globular C-terminal domain that attaches to the cell receptor (16Devaux C. Adrian M. Berthet-Colominas C. Cusack S. Jacrot B. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 567-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 17Ruigrok R.W. Barge A. Albiges-Rizo C. Dayan S. J. Mol.

Each adenovirus type 2 fiber monomer contains 582 amino acids. The shaft contains a repeating sequence motif with an invariant glycine or proline and a conserved pattern of hydrophobic residues (20Green N.M. Wrigley N.G. Russell W.C. Martin S.R. McLachlan A.D. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 1357-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). A stable fragment of the fiber (residues 319–582), containing four repeats of the adenovirus type 2 fiber shaft plus the receptor-binding head domain, has been crystallized and its structure studied to 2.4-Å resolution by x-ray crystallography (12van Raaij M.J. Mitraki A. Lavigne G. Cusack S. Nature. 1999; 401: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). As depicted in Fig. 1, this study revealed a novel triple β-spiral fibrous fold for the shaft. Each sequence repeat contains an extended strand running parallel to the fiber axis, followed by a β-turn, containing a conserved glycine or proline. The turn is followed by another β-strand that runs backwards at an angle of roughly 45° to the shaft axis and is joined to the extended strand of the next repeat by a solvent-exposed loop. Within this fragment of the shaft structure, hydrogen bonds are established between the strand-loop-strand motif, which can be considered as the basic building unit at the structural level (12van Raaij M.J. Mitraki A. Lavigne G. Cusack S. Nature. 1999; 401: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The average diameter of the shaft, excluding the surface loops, is 15 Å. Unfolding studies have provided evidence that this stable domain is the last part of the fiber to unfold (21Mitraki A. Barge A. Chroboczek J. Andrieu J.P. Gagnon J. Ruigrok R.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, relatively little is known about fiber folding and assembly, either in vitro or in vivo. The globular head domain is thought to be essential for trimerization, as deletions or mutations in this part of the protein are known to abolish trimer formation in vivo (22Novelli A. Boulanger P.A. Virology. 1991; 185: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 23Hong J.S. Engler J.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7071-7078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the head domain can successfully be replaced by a foreign trimerization motif, the “foldon” domain of phage T4 fibritin (24Papanikolopoulou K. Forge V. Goeltz P. Mitraki A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8991-8998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).Fig. 1Sequence of the synthetic peptides and structure of the corresponding segment within the native human adenovirus type 2 fiber.

The last four amino acids are in italics and are not part of a repeat but form the junction between the shaft and the head domain.

N and C termini of the segment are labeled, corresponding to residues 355 and 396, respectively; the head domain starts after residue 396. The first amino acid residue of each peptide is shown with arrows. The 41- and 25-amino acid peptides include the last four amino acids (residues 393 to 395, NKND), whereas the 12-, 8-, and 6-aa peptides stop at residue 392.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have recently initiated a study of folding and assembly of the shaft sequences in the absence of those from the head. As part of this study, we initially synthesized a 41-amino acid peptide (PIKTKIGSGIDYNENGAMITKLGSGLSFDNSGAITIGNKND) corresponding to the shaft sequence that is immediately adjacent to the head. This peptide failed to assemble into the triple β-spiral conformation observed in the single crystal study of the stable domain; instead, it aggregated into fibrils similar to those associated with amyloid diseases, namely long, unbranched structures that stain with the dye Congo Red and give a characteristic x-ray fiber diffraction pattern (25Luckey M. Hernandez J. Arlaud G. Forsyth V.T. Ruigrok R.W. Mitraki A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Given these observations, it seems that amino acid sequences from the adenovirus shaft may also provide a simple and well defined model system for the study of amyloid. The purpose of the studies described here was to investigate shorter amino acid sequences from the adenovirus shaft and to further characterize any tendency to form amyloid-type structures in the absence of the globular head of the native structure. To do this, we have synthesized a number of peptides that have a specific relationship to the folds of the native structure, and we studied them with a number of techniques, including electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy, x-ray fiber diffraction, and Congo Red binding, that have come to be regarded as providing diagnostic evidence for the detection of amyloid structures. Below, we describe results from the following subsequences of the original 41-amino acid peptide: a 25-amino acid sequence (AMITKLGSGLSFDNSGAITIGNKND), a 12-amino acid sequence (LSFDNSGAITIG), an 8-amino acid sequence (NSGAITIG), a 6-amino acid sequence (GAITIG), and an 4-amino acid sequence (NKND). Furthermore, we have synthesized and studied a variant of the 6-amino acid peptide where the central threonine has been replaced by proline (GAIPIG). We also include infrared studies and synchrotron x-ray diffraction patterns of the 41-aa 1The abbreviations used are: aa, amino acid(s); FTIR, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. peptide that were not available at the time the original paper was published (25Luckey M. Hernandez J. Arlaud G. Forsyth V.T. Ruigrok R.W. Mitraki A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We find that amyloid formation is a general tendency of the shaft sequences in the absence of the globular head, and we discuss the results in the context of the native fiber folding and assembly. Biological implications concerning the understanding of amyloid formation from repetitive sequences of disease-associated proteins are discussed. The reagents for solid phase peptide synthesis were obtained from Applied Biosystems (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), except dichloromethane, which was from SDS (Solvants Documentation Synthèses, Peypin, France), as was acetonitrile for high performance liquid chromatography. tert-Butyloxycarbonyl amino acids and resin were purchased from Neosystem (Strasbourg, France) or Novabiochem. Ultrapure guanidine hydrochloride was purchased from ICN Biomedicals, and the dye Congo Red was purchased from Sigma. All other chemicals were of the purest grade available. D2O was from Euriso-top (CEA Group, France). C-terminal amide derivatives of the peptides were synthesized by the stepwise solid phase method using an Applied Biosystems 430A automated synthesizer as described previously (25Luckey M. Hernandez J. Arlaud G. Forsyth V.T. Ruigrok R.W. Mitraki A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The 41-, 25-, 12-, and 4-amino acid peptides as well as the GAIPIG peptide were synthesized in-house; the 8- and 6-amino acid peptides were obtained from Bachem, France. The purity of the synthetic peptides was assessed by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, and their identity was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry. The experimental masses of the peptides are as follows: 2507.86 Da for the 25-aa; 1194.31 Da for the 12-aa, 730.82 Da for the 8-aa, 529.64 Da for the 6-aa, 525.32 Da for the GAIPIG peptide, and 488 Da for the 4-aa peptide. Peptide concentrations were determined by in-house amino acid composition analysis. Lyophilized peptide powders were dissolved in water at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 20 mg/ml depending on the peptide. They were subsequently adsorbed to the clean side of a carbon film on mica and negatively stained with 1% sodium silicotungstate. Micrographs were taken with a JEOL 1200 XII microscope, and the magnification was calibrated with negatively stained crystals of catalase. The quality of the images was checked on an optical bench. The negatives were then digitized on a Zeiss scanner (Photoscan TD) with a pixel size of 14 μm. At the level of the sample, the pixel size corresponds to 3.5 Å. For the protofilaments in the samples of the 12-aa peptide, 100 regions from one negative were selected using Ximdisp (26Crowther R.A. Henderson R. Smith J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). The images were then cut out into 128 × 128 boxes and processed by using the SPIDER image analysis package (27Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar). The images were bandpass-filtered between 200 and 10 Å without contrast transfer function correction and normalized to the same mean and standard deviation. One image out of 100 was selected, and the rest of the images were aligned (in translation and rotation) against the selected image. The 50 best matching pictures were averaged, and the same operation was repeated five times by using for each cycle the 50 best images. The final average of the 50 best matching pictures is shown in Fig. 3C. The average shown in Fig. 3D was then padded into a 512 × 512 box and Fourier-transformed, and its power spectra was calculated. The distances from the origin to the peaks were measured and converted into distance 1/Å. The way that the power spectrum is visualized with SPIDER makes that the horizontal distance in the real space is converted to horizontal distances in the Fourier space. 5 μl of a 100 μm stock solution of Congo Red was added to 95 μl of peptide solution, and spectra were recorded from 400 to 600 nm. Before adding the dye, the scattering of the peptide solutions was recorded in the same wavelength range and subtracted from the spectrum of the dye in their presence. The buffer used was 10 mm Hepes, pH 7. Each lyophilized peptide was dissolved in D2O except for the 25-aa peptide that was dissolved in 10 mm deuterated ammonium acetate buffer, pH 4. Immediately after preparation of the solution, an aliquot was removed for concentration determination, and 50 μl of the peptide solution was inserted between CaF2 windows (Spectra-Tech) using a 100-μm spacer. IR spectra were recorded with a Jasco 610 Fourier transform spectrometer. Sixteen interferograms were recorded at room temperature with a resolution of 4 cm–1. For each spectrum the water vapor was subtracted and base-line corrected. Fiber Preparation—Peptide solutions were prepared by dissolving the lyophilized powder in 10 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 4. Fibers were prepared by using shear alignment methods that have been described previously for nucleic acid polymers (28Shotton M.W. Pope L.H. Forsyth V.T. Denny R.C. Archer J. Langan P. Ye H. Boote C. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1998; 31: 758-766Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A droplet of peptide solution (approximate volume 5 μl) was placed between the ends of two glass rods and left to dry. In previous work on amyloid fibers, there have been reports that the use of magnetic fields may improve sample alignment (29Serpell L.C. Fraser P.E. Sunde M. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 526-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 30Inouye H. Bond J.E. Deverin S.P. Lim A. Costello C.E. Kirschner D.A. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 1716-1727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this study, a number of attempts were made to improve the fiber alignment by using the high fields available in the NMR Laboratories at the Institut de Biologie Structurale in Grenoble, France. Although improved alignment was obtained for the fibers formed by the 41-aa peptide, no significant improvement was noted for the 25- and 12-aa peptides. Fiber Diffraction—X-ray fiber diffraction patterns were recorded at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility on the microfocus beam-line ID13. The wavelength was 0.976 Å, and the beam was 5–10 μm in diameter. This experimental arrangement allows the study of thin amyloid fibers for which the orientation was very often better than that of the thicker fibers (as judged by optical microscopy/birefringence measurements under cross-polarized light). Data sets on ID13 were recorded using the instrument in one of two possible modes. The “scanning” arrangement is optimized for the study of the microstructure of materials on a micron scale. The second arrangement is a diffractometer configuration that is optimized for the study of small single crystals. Both arrangements have been described (31Riekel C. Rep. Prog. Phys. 2000; 63: 233-262Crossref Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 32Riekel C. Burghammer M. Roth S. Fibre Diffraction Rev. 2002; 10: 11-18Google Scholar). The fibers formed by the 6- and 8-aa peptides were studied using the scanning arrangement, whereas those for the 41-, 25-, and 12-aa peptides were studied using the diffractometer arrangement. In both cases, data sets were recorded using a MAR CCD detector with a 130-nm entrance window and the following readout parameters: 2048 × 2048 pixels and 64.45 × 64.45 μm pixel size. The specimen to detector distance ranged from 57.1 to 42.8 mm. Diffraction data sets were processed and measured using CCP13 software (33Squire J.M. Al-Khayat H. Arnott S. Crawshaw J. Diakun G. Denny R.C. Dover D. Forsyth V.T. He A. Knupp C. Mant G.R. Rajkumar G. Rodman M.J. Shotton M.S. Windle A. Fibre Diffraction Rev. 2003; 11: 7-19Google Scholar) and the FIT2D package (34Hammersley, A. P. (1998) ESRF Internal Report ESRF98HA01T, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, FranceGoogle Scholar). In all experiments, radiation damage was a major concern. The effect of this was minimized by recording a sequence of diffraction patterns at different positions along the length of the fiber and then adding these images together. “Blank” data sets (recorded with no sample in the beam) were also recorded and later subtracted from the main data sets. The specimen-detector distance was determined by using a standard sample of silver behenate. Peptide Design and Solubility—The original 41-amino acid peptide starts at proline 356 of the full-length fiber sequence; it contains two sequence repeats and ends with a short β-strand (residues 388–392) followed by four residues (393–396) belonging to a flexible linker region that connects the shaft to the globular head (Fig. 1). Based on this original 41-amino acid sequence, we synthesized a 25-mer (AMITKLGSGLSFDNSGAITIGNKND) that starts at residue 372, contains one sequence repeat, and ends with a short β-strand (residues 388–392) plus the four residues (393–396) of the flexible linker region. We have also synthesized a 12-amino acid peptide (residues 381–392, LSFDNSGAITIG), which makes up the basic strand-loop-strand motif in the native structure. We subsequently designed an 8-amino acid peptide, comprising the loop-strand sequence from the 12-amino acid peptide (NSGAITIG), and a 6-amino acid peptide, comprising the last loop residue and the strand residues (GAITIG). We have also synthesized a 6-amino acid peptide where the central threonine of the GAITIG sequence has been replaced by a proline (GAIPIG). The 4-amino acid peptide (residues 393–396, NKND) that is not part of the shaft repeats but corresponds to the charged, flexible linker region that connects the shaft to the head was also synthesized. The solubility of lyophilized peptide powders at the range of 10 mg/ml under different solvent conditions is presented in Table I. The 12-amino acid peptide is soluble up to 5 mg/ml. Once physically into solution in these solvents the 25-, 12-, 8-, and 6-amino acid peptides aggregate with time and form amyloid fibrils (see Table I). At the range of 10 mg/ml, fibril formation is accompanied by an increase in viscosity and subsequent formation of gels. At concentrations around 5 mg/ml, the 25-amino acid peptide forms rapidly (within 20 min) fibrillar aggregates that are visible with the naked eye and sediment at the bottom of the test tube.Table ISolubility of the peptidesPeptide, 10 mg/mlH2OpH 4pH 7Acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid/water25 aa-+-+12 aa (5 mg/ml)++++8 aa++++6 aa++++GAIPIG++++4 aa++++ Open table in a new tab Fibril Formation as Seen by Electron Microscopy—Fig. 2 shows electron micrographs recorded from each of the 25-, 12-, 8-, and 6-amino acid peptides. These pictures were recorded from preparations in water, although similar results were obtained for all of the solvents mentioned above. For each sample there were differences in sample preparation procedures relating to solubility and aggregation time. The electron micrographs shown here were recorded at 13 days at 1 mg/ml for the 12-aa peptide, 6 weeks at 10 mg/ml for the 8-aa peptide, and 20 mg/ml of a freshly made solution for the 6-aa peptide. For the 25-aa peptide, electron micrographs can only be taken immediately after dissolving at low concentrations (0.5 mg/ml) in a poor solvent (water in this case), because otherwise large macroscopic fibrils form very rapidly and cannot be visualized by EM. Unbranched fibrils with variable lengths can be seen for all peptides. They are often laterally associated, forming bundles and twisted ribbons. Single fibril diameters taken from 10 measurements for each peptide with an uncertainty of one pixel size (±1.75 Å) were as follows: 30 Å for the 25-aa peptide, 21 Å for the 12-aa peptide, 24.5 Å for the 8-aa peptide, and 16 Å for the 6-aa peptide. No fibrils, arrays, or amorphous aggregates have been detected in solutions of the GAIPIG peptide and of the 4-aa peptide under any condition; Fig. 2E shows a representative field from a grid where a drop of a 20 mg/ml GAIPIG solution was deposited after 1 month of incubation in water. When samples of the 12-amino acid peptide were deposited on the grid immediately after dissolving the peptide at 1 mg/ml in water, novel extended, array-like structures composed of the thinnest fibrils observed (which will be referred to as “protofilaments”) were observed using low dose EM. At high electron dose, these fine structures are destroyed and are no longer visible. These arrays, which can be clearly seen in Fig. 3 (A–C), appear to be highly regular; Fourier transform analysis (Fig. 3D) reveals a regular spacing of 36 Å between the protofilaments plus a regular spacing of 30 Å along the length of the protofilament. Although no isolated protofilaments were observed in these studies, higher order fibrils and twisted ribbons seem to co-exist in the same fields, indicating that protofilaments may be able to partition into all these morphologies. These polymorphic structural assemblies are reminiscent of those formed from amyloid fibrils of calcitonin and amylin (35Bauer H.H. Aebi U. Haner M. Hermann R. Muller M. Merkle H.P. J. Struct. Biol. 1995; 115: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 36Goldsbury C.S. Cooper G.J. Goldie K.N. Muller S.A. Saafi E.L. Gruijters W.T. Misur M.P. Engel A. Aebi U. Kistler J. J. Struct.

Biol. 2000; 130: 352-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). At later stages of assembly, no extended arrays of protofilaments are observed; only multistrand, flat, or twisted ribbons exist in the fields of the same solution deposited on the grid after aging for 13 days, as seen in Fig. 2B. Although it cannot be directly proven, it is tempting to imply that these later stage assemblies form from protofilaments by either “side-by-side” association or by coiling and twisting, as suggested previously for other systems (35Bauer H.H. Aebi U. Haner M. Hermann R. Muller M. Merkle H.P. J. Struct. Biol. 1995; 115: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 36Goldsbury C.S. Cooper G.J. Goldie K.N. Muller S.A. Saafi E.L.

Kistler J. Cooper G.J. Aebi U. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 130: 352-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, in low dose studies at early time points of the 41-, 25-, 8-, or 6-amino acid peptides, no arrays of protofilaments are observed. Congo Red Binding—Binding of the diazo dye Congo Red is a distinctive property of the amyloid fibrils and one of the main diagnostic tests for their presence. In the presence of amyloid fibrils, a spectral shift of the λmax of the bound dye from 488 to 540 nm is observed (38Klunk W.E. Jacob R.F. Mason R.P. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 285-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The dye spectra in the presence of the 25-, 12-, 8-, and 6-amino acid peptides are shown in Fig. 4, A–D, respectively; they all display the characteristic shift. In contrast, solutions of the GAIPIG peptide and the 4-aa peptide fail to induce the spectral shift of the dye (Fig. 4, E and F, respectively). In addition to the shift of the λmax, we consistently observed hyperchromicity of the dye in the presence of the 8-aa peptide (Fig. 4C). Fig. 4G shows the Congo Red spectra in the presence of a chimeric protein that comprises shaft sequences 319–392 of the fiber N-terminally fused to a foreign trimerization motif, the foldon domain of phage T4 fibritin. These chimeric proteins form remarkably stable, SDS-resistant trimers (24Papanikolopoulou K. Forge V. Goeltz P. Mitraki A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8991-8998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Within these chimeric trimers, the shaft sequences adopt the same triple β-spiral conformation as in their native context, as suggested by their crystal structure that has been solved recently (39Papanikolopoulou K.

However, TCR engagement results in the down-modulation not only of the engaged receptors but also of non-engaged bystander TCRs. We have investigated the mechanisms that mediate the down-modulation of engaged and bystander receptors and show that co-modulation of the bystander TCRs requires protein-tyrosine kinase activity and is mediated by clathrin-coated pits. In contrast, the down-modulation of engaged TCRs is independent of protein-tyrosine kinases and clathrin pits, suggesting that this process is mediated by an alternate mechanism. Indeed, down-modulation of engaged TCRs appears to depend upon lipid rafts, because cholesterol depletion with methyl-β-cyclodextrin completely blocks this process. Thus, two independent pathways of internalization are involved in TCR down-modulation and act differentially on directly engaged and bystander receptors. Finally, we propose that although both mechanisms coexist, the predominance of one or the other mechanisms will depend on the dose of ligand.

At rest, the TCR is continuously internalized and recycled at the T cell surface, a cycle that is dependent on a dileucine endocytosis motif present in the CD3γ subunit (1Jose E.S. Alarcon B. J.

The significance of the constitutive internalization-recycling process is unknown, although it could certainly add plasticity to the topological distribution of the TCR. Indeed, this may facilitate the rapid transport of TCRs to the immune synapse via recycling endosomes when an appropriate antigen-presenting cell is encountered (6Das V. Nal B. Dujeancourt A. Thoulouze M.I. Galli T. Roux P. Dautry-Varsat A. Alcover A. Immunity. 2004; 20: 577-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the endocytosis of the TCR is increased, and TCR recycling is reduced upon T cell activation leading to the down-modulation of the TCR at the cell surface. This is in part because of the phosphorylation of a serine residue upstream of the dileucine motif in CD3γ, which improves the presentation of the dileucine signal to the endocytic machinery. As a result, the dileucine motif binds to AP-2 that in turn recruits the clathrin-dependent endocytic machinery leading to the internalization of the TCR (7Dietrich J. Kastrup J. Nielsen B.L. Odum N. Geisler C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). However, although the serine-dependent dileucine motif of CD3γ is required for phorbol ester-induced TCR down-regulation, it is not necessary for TCR down-regulation induced by anti-CD3 antibodies or by antigen-presenting cells bearing the appropriate MHCp. Hence, it appears that other endocytotic signals may be involved in these cases (8Legendre V. Guimezanes A. Buferne M. Barad M. Schmitt-Verhulst A.M. Boyer C. Int.

Some studies suggest that TCR down-modulation is mediated by an increase in internalization and degradation (9Niedergang F. San Jose E. Rubin B. Alarcon B. Dautry-Varsat A. Alcover A. Res. Immunol. 1997; 148: 231-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 12Niedergang F. Hemar A. Hewitt C.R. Owen M.J. Dautry-Varsat A. Alcover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12839-12845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), whereas others indicate that TCR down-regulation is the result of the increased degradation of the internalized receptors (13Liu H. Rhodes M. Wiest D.L. Vignali D.A. Immunity. 2000; 13: 665-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Whichever the case, TCR degradation through a combination of lysosomeand proteasome-dependent mechanisms does appear to occur (13Liu H. Rhodes M. Wiest D.L. Vignali D.A. Immunity. 2000; 13: 665-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 14Valitutti S. Muller S. Salio M. Lanzavecchia A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1859-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar).The contribution of TCR signaling to TCR internalization and down-modulation is also unclear. Some studies suggest that the TCR internalization and down-modulation are protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK)-dependent processes that ultimately result in the degradation of the TCR (5Alcover A. Alarcon B. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 20: 325-346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Martin S. Bevan M.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2991-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 16Luton F.

Med. 1997; 185: 641-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar).By studying the T cells expressing two distinct TCRs, it was concluded that only TCRs directly triggered by the appropriate MHCp are down-regulated (20Valitutti S.

However, other studies have demonstrated that TCR engagement by antigen, superantigen, or anti-TCR antibodies not only led to the down-regulation of directly triggered TCRs but also to the co-modulation of a proportion of non-engaged (bystander) TCRs (23Bonefeld C.M.

Furthermore, it was recently shown that in contrast to the internalization of engaged TCR, the modulation of bystander TCRs is highly dependent on protein kinase C and the dileucine endocytosis motif of CD3γ (23Bonefeld C.M. Rasmussen A.B. Lauritsen J.P. von Essen M. Odum N. Andersen P.S. Geisler C. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 3003-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In contrast the engaged TCR is down-modulated by a mechanism independent of PTKs. We have further investigated the mechanisms that mediate the internalization of engaged and co-modulated TCRs and found that although the bystander TCR is internalized by a clathrin-dependent process, internalization of the engaged TCR is lipid-raft-dependent.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells—The cell line CH7βRex TTζ (TTζ clone) is a Jurkat transfectant that has been described previously and that expresses the TCRα and β chains (Vβ3.1) of HA 1.7, a T cell clone specific for influenza hemagglutinin peptide 307–319 (27Niedergang F. Dautry-Varsat A. Alcover A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1703-1710PubMed Google Scholar). This cell line was additionally transfected with a chimeric gene encoding the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the human IL-2 receptor α chain (Tac) fused to the cytoplasmic tail of the CD3ζ chain (29Letourneur F. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8905-8909Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The cell line Jk.scTCRβ (clone 2D10) was obtained by transfection of Jurkat with the expression vector pSRα-scTCRVβ3.Antibodies and Chemicals—The mouse monoclonal antibody directed against human CD3, OKT3, was obtained from Ortho Diagnostics. The anti-Tac antibodies, MAR 108 and TP1/6 were generously provided by Drs. M. López-Botet and F. Sánchez-Madrid, respectively (Hospital de la Princesa, Madrid, Spain). The CD3ζ-specific antiserum, Ab 448, was generated by immunization of a New Zealand rabbit with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the amino acid sequence 109–132 of human CD3ζ coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The anti-clathrin heavy chain antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. The fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibodies specific for mouse Igs and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated streptavidin were purchased from Southern Biotechnology, and the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibodies specific for mouse Vβ8 (F23.1) were purchased from Pharmingen. The antibody specific for Vβ3, Jovi3, was a kind gift of Dr. M. Owen (Cancer Research). PP2 was purchased from Calbiochem, methyl-β-cyclodextrin was purchased from Sigma, and nitrophenol (NP)-bovine serum albumin was purchased from Biosearch Technologies.DNA Constructs—To generate the GFP-dynamin and GFP-dynamin K44A constructs, the 3.2-kb fragment from the pUHD10-3-Dyn and pUHD10-3-Dyn K44A vectors (30Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar) were subcloned it into the pLZR-IRES/gfp vector (31Abad J.L. Serrano F. San Roman A.L. Delgado R. Bernad A. Gonzalez M.A. J. Gene Med. 2002; 4: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).Down-regulation Experiments—Antibody-coated plates were generated by incubating plastic 96-well plates (Costar) overnight at 37 °C with 100 μl/well of the appropriate antibody (25 μg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline, and they were washed with phosphate-buffered saline before use. Using radiochemical techniques, the total bound antibody under these conditions was estimated as 20 ng/well. Cells (105/well) were incubated with the desired antibodies in culture medium at 37 °C for the times indicated. The cells were then collected, transferred to ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and washed twice. Subsequently, the cells were stained with the stimulating antibody, followed by a phycoerythrin-conjugated secondary antibody. In co-modulation studies, the cells were stained with the specific antibody labeled with biotin followed by streptavidin-phycoerythrin. The cells were ultimately analyzed in a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and the mean fluorescence intensity was measured at each point.Inhibition of Clathrin-mediated Endocytosis—Potassium depletion was carried out as described previously (32Larkin J.M. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1983; 33: 273-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed and resuspended in hypotonic medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:water, 1:1), and after 5 min at 37 °C the cells were washed in medium without K+ (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and then resuspended in the same medium with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in wells previously coated with the desired antibodies for the times indicated. For acid treatment, the cells were washed and resuspended in RPMI supplemented with 2.5g/liter glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 10 mm acetic acid, as described (33Sandvig K. Olsnes S. Petersen O.W. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 679-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The cells were then incubated at 37 °C in wells previously coated with the desired antibodies for the times indicated.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were collected, washed, resuspended at 2 × 107 cells/ml of RPMI supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and warmed at 37 °C for 10 min for each time point. Afterward, anti-CD3 was added for the periods specified before the cells were lysed in 1 ml of Brij 96 lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (0.33% Brij 96, 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm iodoacetamide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 20 mm sodium fluoride). Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (34San Jose E. Munoz-Fernandez M.A. Alarcon B. Virology. 1997; 239: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).RESULTSThe Nature and Dose of the Ligand Determines the Sensitivity of Antibody-induced TCR Down-modulation to PTK Inhibitors—Conflicting results have been obtained from different studies on the PTK dependence of antibody-induced TCR down-modulation (15Martin S. Bevan M.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2991-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 16Luton F. Buferne M. Davoust J. Schmitt-Verhulst A.M. Boyer C. J.

Med. 1997; 185: 641-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). One reason for such variation could be the use of soluble or immobilized (plate-bound) antibodies. We analyzed the effect of the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 on TCR down-modulation induced by stimulation of Jurkat T cells with different doses of soluble or plate-bound anti-CD3 antibodies. The dose-response curves in the absence of PP2 were very different when soluble or immobilized anti-CD3 was used (Fig. 1A). In the presence of soluble anti-CD3, TCR down-modulation was observed at concentrations as low as 0.1 μg/ml, and it steadily increased in response to increasing antibody concentrations. When plate-bound antibody was used, TCR down-modulation was not observed until the antibody concentration reached 1 μg/ml and above. The response to increasing concentrations of immobilized anti-CD3 was abrupt, resulting in a shift from none to almost complete down-modulation with a 10-fold increase in antibody concentration (Fig. 1A).The effect of PTK inhibition by PP2 was also dependent on the way the stimulus was presented. Although TCR down-modulation induced by soluble anti-CD3 was partly inhibited at all antibody concentrations, the effect on TCR down-modulation induced by a plate-bound antibody was strongly dependent on the dose of the antibody (Fig. 1A). At relatively low concentrations (1–3 μg/ml) TCR down-modulation was completely inhibited by PP2, whereas at high concentrations (10–30 μg/ml) TCR down-modulation was refractory to PTK inhibition. At the dose used, PP2 completely blocked TCR signaling, even at high doses of stimulating antibody, as measured by the tyrosine phosphorylation of total proteins and the induction of the CD69 activation marker (data not shown), suggesting that PTKs were completely inhibited. Therefore these results suggest that PTK-dependent and -independent mechanisms mediate the antibody-induced down-regulation of the TCR. Moreover, the preponderance of one or the other depends on the way the antibody is presented (soluble or immobilized) as well as on the dose of antibody.At certain concentrations of plate-bound antibody, TCR engagement led to its down-modulation by a PTK-independent mechanism. A feature that characterized this mechanism was that the stimulated cells shift abruptly from a non-modulated to a fully modulated state (clearly seen in Fig. 1B). In the absence of PP2, stimulation with increasing concentrations of soluble anti-CD3 induced a gradual decrease of TCR expression on the cell surface. However, when stimulated with a high concentration of plate-bound anti-CD3 (10 μg/ml) two cell populations were seen to exist, one in which the TCR was not down-modulated (Fig. 1B, population a) together with another in which TCR down-modulation was virtually complete (population b). In contrast, stimulation with a small amount of immobilized anti-CD3 (1 μg/ml) induced only a small decrease in TCR expression in the whole T cell population (Fig. 1B). Incubation with PP2 completely prevented the decrease in TCR intensity in cells stimulated with low doses of immobilized anti-CD3 (or with soluble anti-CD3) but did not alter the discontinuous down-modulation induced by high doses of immobilized anti-CD3.Directly Engaged and Bystander TCRs Are Down-modulated by Different Mechanisms—Along with others, we have demonstrated that engagement of a TCR with a specific ligand results not only in its own down-modulation but also in that of non-engaged bystander TCRs. We proposed that the differential sensitivity of TCR down-modulation to PP2 inhibition observed upon stimulation with different doses of immobilized anti-CD3 (shown in Fig. 1) might indicate the existence of different mechanisms underlying the down-modulation of directly engaged and bystander TCRs. We determined the sensitivity to PP2 of the down-modulation of engaged and non-engaged TCRs. Jurkat T cells were transfected with an immunoglobulin single chain (scFv)-TCRβ construct in a way that the transfected cell expresses two TCR complexes, one with the endogenous Vβ8-containing TCRβ and the other with the transfected scFv-(and Vβ3)-containing TCRβ. The immunoglobulin single chain fused to the transfected Vβ3-TCRβ confers specificity to the NP hapten, and a stable cell transfectant of scFv(Vβ3)-TCRβ in Jurkat T cells was generated. Stimulation of these cells with NP conjugated to bovine serum albumin induced near maximal down-modulation of the scFv(Vβ3)-containing TCR at a concentration of 30 μg/ml (Fig. 2). The dose-response curve and the sensitivity to PP2 inhibition made the stimulation with NP-bovine serum albumin appear very similar to stimulation with soluble anti-CD3 (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, stimulation with NP-bovine serum albumin induced the co-modulation of the non-engaged Vβ8-containing TCR. Interestingly, the co-modulation of the bystander Vβ8-TCR was completely inhibited by PP2 treatment, whereas down-modulation of the directly engaged TCR was only partially inhibited. Therefore, these results indicate that the bystander non-engaged TCR is down-modulated by a PTK-dependent mechanism, whereas the stimulated TCR is down-regulated by a mixture of PTK-dependent and -independent mechanisms.Fig. 2TCR engagement results in the PTK-dependent co-modulation of bystander TCR. Jurkat cells transfected with the scFv(Vβ3)-TCRβ construct were stimulated for 1 h with soluble NP-bovine serum albumin ligand in the presence or absence of PP2. Expression of the transfected scFv(Vβ3)-TCRβ (direct modulation) and the endogenous Vβ8-TCRβ (comodulation) TCRs was analyzed by flow cytometry after staining with Vβ-specific antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Down-modulation of Directly Engaged and Bystander TCRs Are Differentially Dependent on Endocytosis Mediated by Clathrin-coated Pits—To further study the mechanisms that mediate the down-modulation of engaged and bystander TCR, we proceeded to study Jurkat T cells transfected with a CD25(Tac)-CD3ζ chimera (TTζ). This chimera results from appending the cytoplasmic tail of CD3ζ to the extracellular and transmembrane domains of CD25. We preferred to use these cell transfectants instead of the scFv(Vβ3)-TCRβ transfectant, because the TTζ chimera does not associate with the TCR complex (28San Jose E. Borroto A. Niedergang F. Alcover A. Alarcon B. Immunity. 2000; 12: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the contrary, it is still possible that a single TCR complex includes two different TCRβs (24Exley M. Wileman T. Mueller B. Terhorst C. Mol. Immunol. 1995; 32: 829-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 25Fernandez-Miguel G. Alarcon B. Iglesias A. Bluethmann H. Alvarez-Mon M. Sanz E. de la Hera A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We stimulated clone 4 (a Jurkat clone expressing low levels of TTζ relative to CD3) with an anti-CD3 antibody to study the direct modulation of the TCR complex and the co-modulation of the TTζ chimera. In parallel, clone 65 (a Jurkat clone expressing high levels of TTζ) was stimulated with an anti-Tac antibody to study the direct modulation of the TTζ chimera and the co-modulation of the TCR complex. The stimulation of clone 4 with a high dose of plate-bound anti-CD3 antibody induced both the discontinuous down-modulation of the TCR complex, the “all-or-nothing” effect described in Fig. 1B, and co-modulation of the TTζ chimera (Fig. 3). Conversely, the stimulation of clone 65 with a high dose of anti-Tac resulted in the discontinuous all-or-nothing down-regulation of the TTζ chimera and the co-modulation of the TCR. The stimulation of each clone with the inverse antibody also caused the co-modulation of the bystander receptor, although, probably because of the suboptimal TTζ/TCR ratio, the effect was not so dramatic (data not shown).Fig. 3Engagement of the TCR or a TTζ chimera induces the co-modulation of the reciprocal receptor. Jurkat T cells were stably transfected with the TTζ chimera. Two clones expressing low (clone 4) or high (clone 65) levels of the chimera were used to study the co-modulation of bystander receptors. Clone 4 was stimulated for 1 h with 10 μg/ml immobilized OKT3 to analyze the direct modulation of the engaged TCR and the co-modulation of the bystander TTζ chimera. Clone 65 was stimulated for 1 h with 10 μg/ml immobilized anti-Tac (CD25) antibody MAR108 to analyze the direct modulation of the TTζ chimera and the co-modulation of the TCR. The populations of modulated (b) and non-modulated (a) cells are indicated as in the legend to Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We then examined the role of clathrin-coated pits in the down-modulation of the engaged and non-engaged receptors. We first examined whether we could co-precipitate the engaged and non-engaged receptors with clathrin. The TCR has been shown to undergo AP2- and clathrin-dependent constitutive internalization (7Dietrich J. Kastrup J. Nielsen B.L. Odum N. Geisler C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and accordingly, the TCR co-precipitated with clathrin in non-stimulated cells (Fig. 4A). However, stimulation of clone 4 with a high dose of immobilized anti-CD3 for 15 and 60 min did not increase the TCR that co-precipitated with clathrin, suggesting that down-modulation of the engaged TCR takes place without an increased association with clathrin-coated pits. Interestingly, stimulation of clone 4 with anti-CD3 induced the co-precipitation of clathrin with TTζ, suggesting that stimulation of the TCR could promote recruitment of the bystander receptor to clathrin-coated pits.Fig. 4TCR engagement induces the association of clathrin to bystander TTζ chimera. A, clone 4 was stimulated on Petri dishes coated with 10 μg/ml OKT3 for the times indicated. Cells were collected, lysed, and immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-CD3 (OKT3) or anti-Tac (MAR108) antibodies. After SDS-PAGE, immunoblotting was performed with an anti-clathrin heavy chain antibody and then reprobed with anti-Tac antibody TP1/6. Arrows indicate the positions of clathrin heavy chain and of TTζ as a loading control. B, down-modulation of the engaged and bystander receptors is inhibited by a dominant negative dynamin-1 construct. Clone 4 cells were transiently transfected either with the K44A mutant of dynamin 1 in a GFP-expressing vector (Dyn DN) or with wild type dynamin 1 in the same vector (Dyn WT). After stimulation in wells coated with 10 μg/ml OKT3 for the times indicated, TCR (direct modulation) and TTζ (comodulation) down-modulation was assessed by flow cytometry after gating the GFP+ cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further investigate the dependence of clathrin for TCR down-regulation, we overexpressed a dominant negative mutant of dynamin. This GTPase is necessary to close the neck of the coated pit, and therefore expression of the dominant negative mutant inhibits receptor internalization by preventing the formation of endocytic vesicles (30Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). The effect of expressing dominant negative dynamin in the down-modulation of engaged and non-engaged receptors was studied by transiently transfecting clone 4 either with the K44A mutant of dynamin 1 using a bicistronic GFP-expressing vector or with wild type dynamin 1. The transfected cells were stimulated with anti-CD3, and the expression of the TCR and TTζ was examined by flow cytometry upon gating on the GFP-positive population. Expression of the dominant negative dynamin partly inhibited the down-modulation of both the TCR and the bystander TTζ compared with expression of wild type dynamin 1 (Fig. 4B) or to untransfected cells (data not shown).In addition to its role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, dynamin may also control the endocytosis of receptors that use a clathrin-independent pathway (36Lamaze C.

Using intravital video microscopy, we tested the hypothesis that inhaled CO (250 ppm) would mimic HO-derived liver protection. Hind limb I/R significantly decreased sinusoidal diameter and volumetric flow, increased leukocyte accumulation within sinusoids, increased leukocyte rolling and adhesion within postsinusoidal venules, and significantly increased hepatocyte injury compared with naive animals. Inhalation of CO alone did not alter any microcirculatory or inflammatory parameters. Inhalation of CO following I/R restored volumetric flow, decreased stationary leukocytes within sinusoids, decreased leukocyte rolling and adhesion within postsinusoidal venules, and significantly reduced hepatocellular injury following hind limb I/R. HO inhibition did not alter microcirculatory parameters in naive mice, but did increase inflammation, as well as increase hepatocyte injury following hind limb I/R. Inhalation of CO during HO inhibition significantly reduced such microcirculatory deficits, hepatic inflammation, and injury in response to hind limb I/R. In conclusion, these results suggest that HO-derived hepatic protection is mediated by CO, and inhalation of low concentrations of CO may represent a novel therapeutic approach to prevent remote organ injury during systemic inflammatory response syndrome, or SIRS."

Haploid yeast strains defective in proofreading by DNA polymerase δ are killed by cadmium, and proofreading defective diploid strains treated with cadmium survive and show synergistic mutagenesis with cadmium. These observations and the lack of or weak mutagenesis upon treatments with equivalent concentrations of other metals and agents causing DNA damage all suggest that cadmium-induced mutagenesis is not due to DNA damage per se but is rather due to inhibition of MMR of DNA replication errors. In further support of this hypothesis, cadmium inhibits the ability of extracts of human cells to repair a single-base insertion deletion mismatch in vitro (1Jin Y.H. Clark A.B. Slebos R.J.

MutSα is primarily responsible for repairing single base-base and insertion/deletion (IDL) mismatches, MutSβ is primarily responsible for repairing IDL mismatches containing multiple extra nucleotides in one strand, and the two complexes share responsibility for repairing IDL mismatches with one extra base. Eukaryotes also encode multiple MutL homologs that form different heterodimers. These heterodimers act as matchmakers to coordinate the various steps in MMR. MutLα (Mlh1-Pms1 in yeast) is involved in repairing a wide variety of mismatches, while MutLβ (Mlh1-Mlh2) and MutLγ (Mlh1-Mlh3) are thought to participate in repairing a subset of insertion-deletion mismatches. Several exonucleases are implicated in mismatch excision, especially including Exo1, and excision and DNA re-synthesis also require MutSα, MutLα, RPA, RFC, PCNA, and DNA polymerase δ (see Refs. 16Dzantiev L.

Inactivation of MMR protein functions is well known to have numerous biological consequences, including genome instability, resistance to DNA damaging agents including chemotherapeutic drugs, altered class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes, emergence of pathogenic bacteria, infertility, and increased susceptibility to cancer (reviewed in Refs. 6Kolodner R.D.

Because cadmium is ubiquitous in the environment and can accumulate in the body due to a long biological half-life (Ref. 21McMurray C.T. Tainer J.A. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 239-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar and references therein), and because cadmium is a known carcinogen that inhibits MMR, we undertook the present study to identify the MMR protein target(s) and the mechanism of inhibition of MMR by cadmium. Here we present evidence that cadmium inhibits two functions of eukaryotic MutS complexes, ATP hydrolysis, and specific binding to mismatched DNA. These effects are sufficient to explain cadmium inhibition of MMR activity in vivo. Cell-free Extracts, Mismatch Repair, and in Vitro Replication Assays—Procedures for extract and heteroduplex substrate preparation and for measuring repair activity were as described (22Thomas D.C. Umar A. Kunkel T.A. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1995; 7Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The substrates used are described in the legend to Fig. 1. SV40 origin-dependent DNA replication assays were performed as described (23Roberts J.D. Kunkel T.A. Methods Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 295-313Google Scholar). Where indicated, the reaction mixture was preincubated with 50 μm CdCl2 for 10 min at 0 °C prior to adding substrate. Purification of Heterodimers—yMlh1-yPms1 was purified as described previously (24Hall M.C. Kunkel T.A. Protein Expression Purif. 2001; 21: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). yMsh2-yMsh6 was overexpressed in selection medium containing 2% galactose and purified as previously described with the following modifications (25Drotschmann K. Yang W. Kunkel T.A. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2002; 1: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The heterodimer was step eluted from a nickel resin column with 100 mm imidazole, 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 200 mm NaCl and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. After eluting from a 1-ml heparin column, the fractions were applied to a 1 ml HiTrap Q column. Eluted fractions were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol and stored at –70 °C. ATPase Assays—ATPase activity was assayed at 30 °C in 20 μl reaction mixtures containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 40 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Concentrations of enzymes and ATP used were 30 nm yMsh2-yMsh6 or 1 μm yMlh1-yPms1 and 0.25–50 μm [γ-32P]ATP, unless otherwise indicated. Where indicated, reaction mixtures were preincubated with 50 μm CdCl2 for 10 min on ice prior to adding ATP. Products were separated by thin layer chromotography using 0.4 m NH4HCO3 as solvent. DNA Binding Assays—DNA equilibrium binding assays were performed as described (25Drotschmann K. Yang W. Kunkel T.A.

G·T41 heteroduplex and A·T41 homoduplex were prepared from oligonucleotides: 5′-TCGTTTTACAACGTCGTGAATGAGAAAACCCTGGCGTTACC, 5′-GGTAACGCCAGGGTTTTCTCGTTCACGACGTTGTAAAACGA, and 5′-GGTAACGCCAGGGTTTTCTCATTCACGACGTTGTAAAACGA. Assays were performed using 0.5–100 nm yMsh2-yMsh6 protein and 1 nm DNA substrate. Where indicated, the reaction mixture was preincubated with 50 μm CdCl2 on ice for 10 min prior to adding substrate. Kd values were determined from gel shift results as described previously (27Schofield M.J. Nayak S. Scott T.H. Du C. Hsieh P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28291-28299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Cadmium Inhibition of in Vitro Human Mismatch Repair—We previously showed that low concentrations of cadmium inhibit MMR activity in vitro by extracts of human cells using a substrate containing a 1-base IDL mismatch and a nick to direct strand-specific repair that is located 5′ to the mismatch (see Ref. 1Jin Y.H. Clark A.B. Slebos R.J. Al-Refai H. Taylor J.A. Kunkel T.A. Resnick M.A. Gordenin D.A. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar and left most entry in Fig. 1A). To determine whether cadmium inhibits both MutSα-dependent and MutSβ-dependent MMR, and to determine whether cadmium inhibits MMR involving excision initiated at both 3′ as well as 5′ nicks, we began this study by examining the ability of cadmium to inhibit MMR using four additional substrates. The MutSα-dependent repair of a G·G mismatch with a nick either 3′ or 5′ to the mismatch was inhibited by 50 μm CdCl2 (Fig. 1A). Additionally, the repair of a 2-base IDL mismatch that was shown previously to depend on MutSβ (28Umar A. Risinger J.I. Glaab W.E. Tindall K.R. Barrett J.C. Kunkel T.A. Genetics. 1998; 148: 1637-1646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was also inhibited by 50 μm CdCl2. These results in human cell extracts are consistent with genetic evidence in yeast (1Jin Y.H. Clark A.B. Slebos R.J. Al-Refai H. Taylor J.A. Kunkel T.A. Resnick M.A. Gordenin D.A. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) indicating that cadmium inhibits both MSH2-MSH3- and MSH2-MSH6-dependent repair of base substitution and IDL mismatches. They further show that cadmium inhibition occurs when the nick that serves as the strand discrimination signal is located either 3′ or 5′ to the mismatch. Effect of Other Divalent Metals on MMR Activity—Two proteins involved in MMR, the large subunit of RPA (29Lin Y.L. Shivji M.K. Chen C. Kolodner R. Wood R.D. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1453-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and DNA polymerase δ (30Chung D.W. Zhang J.A. Tan C.K. Davie E.W. So A.G. Downey K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11197-11201Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), are known to contain zinc fingers. Like zinc, cadmium has a high affinity for sulfhydryl groups in proteins and can compete with zinc for binding to zinc metalloproteins. We therefore tested whether zinc can prevent cadmium inhibition of MMR activity. In the absence of zinc, 15 μm CdCl2 moderately inhibited MMR (Fig. 1B). Addition of an equal amount of ZnSO4 did not reverse this inhibition (Fig. 1B). This is interesting because zinc is reported to protect against cadmium-induced carcinogenesis (see Ref. 31Waalkes M.P. Mutat. Res. 2003; 533: 107-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar and references therein). Thus, the protection awarded by zinc in vivo may occur through another mechanism. Rather than protection, here we observe that zinc alone inhibited MMR activity (Fig. 1, B and C), and the inhibitory effects of cadmium and zinc were additive (Fig. 1B). These data suggest that cadmium is not inhibiting mismatch repair by replacing zinc in a zinc metalloprotein. Instead, they are consistent with the possibility that both metals may inactivate a common MMR protein target. Note that zinc inhibition of MMR is not observed in yeast (1Jin Y.H. Clark A.B. Slebos R.J. Al-Refai H. Taylor J.A. Kunkel T.A. Resnick M.A. Gordenin D.A. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), suggesting that other factor(s) affect the accessibility of metal ions to MutSα in vivo. In contrast to inhibition of MMR activity by cadmium and zinc, neither CoCl2, MnCl2, or NiSO4 inhibited MMR activity (Fig. 2C and Ref. 1Jin Y.H. Clark A.B. Slebos R.J. Al-Refai H. Taylor J.A. Kunkel T.A. Resnick M.A. Gordenin D.A. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Effects of Cadmium on DNA Replication—Our initial study (1Jin Y.H. Clark A.B. Slebos R.J. Al-Refai H. Taylor J.A. Kunkel T.A. Resnick M.A. Gordenin D.A. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) demonstrated that MMR was inhibited in vivo by concentrations of cadmium that had little effect on yeast cell growth. This implies that cadmium does not strongly inhibit DNA replication. To test this in the human system, we examined the ability of CdCl2 to inhibit SV40 origin-dependent DNA replication catalyzed by the same extracts that were used to measure MMR activity. Addition of 50 μm CdCl2, which strongly inhibits MMR activity (Fig. 1A and Ref. 1Jin Y.H. Clark A.B. Slebos R.J. Al-Refai H. Taylor J.A. Kunkel T.A. Resnick M.A. Gordenin D.A. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), had a negligible effect on replication activity or on the distribution of replication products (Fig. 1D). The fact that cadmium does not inhibit yeast cell growth and has little effect on SV40 origin-dependent DNA replication in human cell extracts suggests that those proteins common to replication and MMR, i.e. RPA, RFC, PCNA, and DNA polymerase δ, are unlikely targets for cadmium inhibition of MMR activity. In addition, the assay used to detect MMR activity in our initial study (1Jin Y.H. Clark A.B. Slebos R.J. Al-Refai H. Taylor J.A. Kunkel T.A. Resnick M.A. Gordenin D.A. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) and in Fig. 1A does not require repair DNA synthesis (32Umar A. Buermeyer A.B. Simon J.A. Thomas D.C. Clark A.B. Liskay R.M. Kunkel T.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 65-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Therefore, cadmium is most likely inhibiting human MMR activity in vitro at a step or steps prior to repair DNA synthesis. Moreover, Lützen et al. (5Lützen A. Liberti S.E. Rasmussen L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 321: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) have recently reported that cadmium does not inhibit the 5′-exonuclease activity of hEXO1 or formation of hEXO1 protein complexes. Collectively, all these facts focused our attention on examining whether cadmium alters the functions of those proteins required for the earliest steps of MMR, i.e. MutSα and MutLα. Cadmium Inhibition of ATP Hydrolysis by Yeast MutSα but Not MutLα—Eukaryotic MutSα and MutLα both bind and hydrolyze ATP, and these abilities are essential for MMR activity. To determine whether cadmium could inhibit MMR activity by inhibiting ATP hydrolysis, the ATPase activities of yeast MutSα (Msh2-Msh6) and MutLα (Mlh1-Pms1) were assayed in the absence and presence of cadmium. While cadmium had little effect on ATP hydrolysis by MutLα (Fig. 2A), 50 μm CdCl2 reduced ATP hydrolysis by MutSα to only 20% of that observed in the absence of cadmium (Fig. 2A). As a negative control, 50 μm MnCl2 did not inhibit the ATPase activity of MutSα (Fig. 2A). After incubation of yMsh2His-yMsh6 in the presence of 50 μm CdCl2, both proteins were pulled down from the mixture by nickel agarose beads (data not shown). Because cadmium does not eliminate heterodimerization of the two proteins, the inhibition of MutSα ATPase function by cadmium is not likely to be due to disruption of the Msh2-Msh6 complex. Inhibition of ATP hydrolysis by MutSα increased with increasing CdCl2 concentration, and the dose response for this inhibition was remarkably similar to that observed for inhibition of MMR activity in extracts (see relative values in Fig. 2B). The effects of cadmium on ATP hydrolysis by yeast MutLα and MutSα were further examined by steady state kinetic analysis. The Km, Kcat, and Kcat/Km values for MutLα were similar in the presence and absence of cadmium (Table I), whereas for wild type MutSα (left panel in Fig. 2C), the presence of 50 μm CdCl2 increased the Km and decreased the Kcat resulting in a 6-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency (Table I). These results demonstrate that cadmium inhibits the ATPase activity of yeast MutSα but not MutLα.Table IEffect of 50 μm CdCl2 on yMlh1-Pms1 and yMsh2-yMsh6 ATPase activityProteinKmKcatKcat/Kmμmmin-1yMlh1·Pms119.30.19.001yMlh1·Pms1 + 50 μm cadmium15.20.14.001yMsh2·Msh69.65.00.52yMsh2·Msh6 + 50 μm cadmium26.22.30.08yMsh2E768A·Msh60.60.61.0yMsh2E768A· Msh6 + 50 μm cadmium4.20.20.05yMsh2·Msh6E1068A3.90.20.05yMsh2·Msh6E1068A + 50 μm cadmium4.50.20.04 Open table in a new tab Evidence That Cadmium Inhibits ATP Hydrolysis by Msh6 but Not Msh2—MutSα belongs to the ABC transporter family of ATPase proteins, and it has two composite ATPase active sites, each comprised of five conserved motifs contributed by one subunit and a sixth motif contributed in trans by the other subunit. Among these motifs, the Walker B motif of Msh2 and Msh6 contains a conserved glutamate residue that is essential for ATP hydrolysis (25Drotschmann K. Yang W. Kunkel T.A. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2002; 1: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To determine whether cadmium inhibits ATP hydrolysis by Msh2, Msh6, or both, we performed steady state kinetic analysis of ATP hydrolysis by purified mutant heterodimers containing an inactivating glutamate to alanine substitution in the Walker B motif of either Msh2 (E768A) or yMsh6 (E1062A). Cadmium reduced the efficiency of ATP hydrolysis by the Msh2E768A-Msh6 heterodimer by 20-fold but had no effect on the efficiency of ATP hydrolysis by the Msh2-Msh6E1062A heterodimer (Table I and Fig. 2C). These results indicate that cadmium inhibits ATP hydrolysis by yMsh6, but it does not inhibit ATP hydrolysis by yMsh2. This could be due to selective interaction of cadmium with Msh6 protein. Alternatively, because residues from Msh2 contribute to the composite ATPase active site in Msh6, ATP hydrolysis by Msh6 could be inhibited by cadmium interactions with Msh2. Experiments are under way to identify the target residues within Msh2 and/or Msh6 that are responsible for cadmium inhibition.

Microbiol. 2003; 57: 579-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) have revealed that MMR requires close coordination between adenine nucleotide binding and ATP hydrolysis by the ATPase active sites in MutSα with its binding affinity for mismatched DNA. We therefore used an electrophoretic mobility shift assay to examine the effects of cadmium on MutSα binding to 41 base pair duplex DNAs that were either completely matched or contained a single G·T mismatch. The results show that in the absence of cadmium, and as expected based on earlier studies (38Marsischky G.T. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26668-26682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), yeast MutSα binds to mismatched DNA with 34-fold higher affinity than it binds to matched DNA (Table II). However, in the presence of 50 μm CdCl2, MutSα binding affinity for mismatched DNA was reduced by 18-fold, to the Kd value only slightly higher than that for binding to matched DNA (Table II). Cadmium also reduced binding to matched DNA, but the Kd only increased by 1.6-fold, from 34 to 55 nm (Table II).These results demonstrate that cadmium reduces the DNA binding affinity of MutSα as well as its ability to discriminate between matched and mismatched DNA.Table IIEffect of CdCl2 on DNA binding by yMsh2-yMsh6SubstrateKdnmG·T1G·T + 50 μm cadmium18A·T34A·T + 50 μm cadmium55 Open table in a new tab Summary and Implications—The results presented here are consistent with cadmium inhibition of MutSα and MutSβ-dependent MMR activity through interactions that inhibit ATP hydrolysis and reduce DNA binding affinity and mismatch recognition specificity by MutSα and, by extrapolation, perhaps MutSβ. Alone or in combination, these biochemical effects are sufficient to explain the inhibition of human MMR activity observed in vitro and of yeast MMR in cells (1Jin Y.H. Clark A.B. Slebos R.J. Al-Refai H. Taylor J.A. Kunkel T.A. Resnick M.A. Gordenin D.A. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) and the altered response of human cells to alkylation damage (5Lützen A. Liberti S.E. Rasmussen L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 321: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, the results presented here do not completely exclude that cadmium might also interfere with other proteins or steps in MMR. The interactions of cadmium with Msh2 and/or Msh6 that are responsible for inhibition are unknown. Cadmium could perhaps inhibit ATP hydrolysis by competing with magnesium binding at the ATPase active site that is required for hydrolysis. Although this possibility cannot yet be excluded, it seems unlikely for three reasons. First, cadmium cannot replace magnesium for activation of the ATPase activity of MutSα (data not shown), and the effects we report are observed using cadmium concentrations (e.g. 50 μm) that are much lower than the magnesium concentration (2 mm) used in the ATPase assays. Second, magnesium is required for ATP hydrolysis by both Msh2 and Msh6, yet the results in Fig. 2C and Table I suggest that cadmium preferentially inhibits ATP hydrolysis by Msh6 but not by Msh2. Third, if cadmium was to compete with magnesium at the ATPase active site, it would be expected to also inhibit ATP hydrolysis by bacterial MutS, yet in an initial experiment, 50 μm CdCl2 failed to inhibit ATP hydrolysis by Taq MutS (data not shown). An alterative possibility is that cadmium binds to Msh2 and/or Msh6 at a different location, e.g. through coordination with cysteines that contain sulfhydryl groups and/or histidine, glutamate, and aspartate residues in tetrahedral geometries (21McMurray C.T. Tainer J.A. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 239-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 39Castagnetto J.M. Hennessy S.W. Roberts V.A. Getzoff E.D. Tainer J.A. Pique M.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Such a cadmium coordination site could be in Msh2 or in Msh3 and Msh6 or some combination of these. This site should be highly specific to account for cadmium inhibition of MMR but not DNA replication (Ref. 1Jin Y.H. Clark A.B. Slebos R.J. Al-Refai H. Taylor J.A. Kunkel T.A. Resnick M.A. Gordenin D.A. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar and Fig. 1D) or other types of DNA repair (1Jin Y.H. Clark A.B. Slebos R.J. Al-Refai H. Taylor J.A. Kunkel T.A. Resnick M.A. Gordenin D.A. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) and to account for the asymmetric reduction in ATP hydrolysis (Table I) and the reduced DNA binding discrimination between mismatched and matched DNA. Theoretically, one cadmium binding site may be sufficient to influence both ATP hydrolysis and DNA binding specificity, e.g. if cadmium binding interferes with conformational changes in this large and conformationally active heterodimer. Experiments are under way in an attempt to identify a cadmium binding site. We thank Mark Schofield and Peggy Hsieh for generously supplying Taq MutS and John Fortune for supplying yMutLα.

These findings suggested that UVB-generated PPARγ-agonistic activity was due to the free radical mediated non-enzymatic cleavage of endogenous glycerophosphocholines. Treatment with the specific PPARγ antagonist GW9662 or expression of a dominant-negative PPARγ mutant in KB cells inhibited UVB-induced epidermal cell prostaglandin E2 production. These findings suggested that UVB-generated PPARγ activity is necessary for the optimal production of epidermal prostaglandins. These studies demonstrated that epithelial cells contain a functional PPARγ system, and this system is a target for UVB through the production of novel oxidatively modified endogenous phospholipids.

The exact mechanisms by which UVB irradiation leads to cytokine release in keratinocytes are still unknown. One possible mechanism is related to the ability of UVB to act as a potent pro-oxidative stressor (5Peus D. Vasa R.A. Meves A. Pott M. Beyerle A. Squillace K. Pittelkow M.R. J. Investig.

Oxidatively modified phospholipids, especially those arising from alkyl glycerophosphocholines (GPC), can exert potent biological activities (reviewed in Refs. 9Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A.

For example, oxidation of low density lipoprotein generates a series of lipid inflammatory mediators among which some fragmented phospholipids could potently activate inflammatory cells through the platelet-activating factor receptor (12Marathe G.K.

To date, 1-hexadecyl 2-azelaoyl phosphatidylcholine (azPC) is the only oxidized GPC with PPARγ-agonistic activity described (14Davies S.S. Pontsler A.V. Marathe G.K. Harrison K.A. Murphy R.C.

This oxidized GPC is a potent PPARγ agonist, exerting effects in the nanomolar range. The PPARs are ligand-dependent transcription factors that regulate target gene expression by binding to specific peroxisome proliferator-response elements (PPREs) (reviewed in Ref. 15Wahli W. Braissant O. Desvergne B. Chem Biol. 1995; 2: 261-266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Three isoforms, encoded by separate genes, have been identified so far: PPARα, PPARγ, and PPARδ (reviewed in Ref. 16Berger J. Moller D.E. Annu. Rev.

Recent studies have suggested that PPARγ also plays an important role in the control of cytokine release and inflammatory mediator expression (17Hirsch E.C. Breidert T Rousselet E Hunot S.

The regulatory effects of PPARγ on epidermal inflammation and cytokine release have not been examined. Since UVB has potent pro-oxidative effects, and oxidative fragmentation of phospholipids could result in the non-enzymatic production of potent PPARγ agonists, the objective of the present study was to assess whether UVB irradiation of keratinocytes could result in a PPARγ-agonistic activity. The present studies provide evidence that UVB irradiation triggers the production of novel oxidized GPCs, including azPC, which appears to be involved in UVB-mediated PGE2 production. These findings suggested that the epidermal PPARγ system is a novel target for UVB. Materials—All chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise indicated.

Pei Y. Travers J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26917-26921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The KB/PPARγ dominant-negative model was created by transfection of KB cells with the PPARγ dominant-negative construct encoding the mutant hPPARγ (human PPARγ) with two point mutations in the AF-2 domain, L466A and E469A (22Barroso I. Gurnell M. Crowley V.E. Agostini M. Schwabe J.W. Soos M.A. Maslen G.L. Williams T.D. Lewis H. Schafer A.J. Chatterjee V.K. O'Rahilly S. Nature. 1999; 402: 880-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar); control cells were transfected with mock plasmid pcDNA3.1. The PPARγ dominant-negative plasmid was a kind gift from Dr. V. K. K. Chatterjee (University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK). RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was first isolated from cultured cells and purified using Tripure (Roche Diagnostics), according to the manufacturer's protocol. An additional phenol (pH 4.2) extraction was then performed, followed by ethanol precipitation. The mRNA was reversed-transcribed into cDNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Superscript II RNase H- reverse transcriptase kit, Invitrogen). Briefly, 5 μg of total RNA and 0.5 μg of oligo(dT)12–18 primer were heated to 70 °C for 10 min and briefly chilled on ice. After primer annealing, the following were added: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm dNTP, and 40 units of RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor. The reaction was incubated for 50 min at 42 °C and then for 15 min at 70 °C. An aliquot of each reaction was subsequently used as template for a PCR reaction. Primer sequences for human PPARγ were as follows: PPARγ sense, 5′-tctctccgtaatggaagacc-3′; PPARγ antisense, 5′-gcattatgagacatccccac-3′ (23Xin X. Yang S. Kowalski J. Gerritsen M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9116-9121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). The PCR mixture contained a cDNA template derived from total RNA, 1 unit of recombinant Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), 50 pmol each of 5′ and 3′ primers (Invitrogen), 0.2 mm dNTP, in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgSO4 in a volume of 50 μl. The PCR reaction for PPARγ was performed using a Hybaid PCRExpress thermocycler as follows: 94 °C for 120 s and then 30 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 120 s followed by 74 °C for 10 min. Samples were applied on 1% agarose gel prestained with ethidium bromide. Immunoblotting—Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40) containing 0.5 mm Pefabloc SC (Roche Diagnostics) and 10 mm sodium orthovanadate for 20 min on ice. Total cellular protein of 40 μg was separated on 10% SDS-PAGE; PPARγ and COX-2 protein expression was determined by immunoblotting with PPARγ polyclonal antibody and COX-2 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), respectively, and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). The expression of COX-2 protein was normalized to the levels of housekeeping protein actin. The arbitrary optical densities were measured by Scion Image Software (Scion Co., Frederick, MD). PPRE-Luciferase Reporter Assay—Cells were plated at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells/plate in 100-mm dishes and allowed to stabilize for 1 day. Cells were then transfected with 10 μg of PPARλ-luciferase reporter plasmid (pPPAR-luc) (14Davies S.S. Pontsler A.V. Marathe G.K. Harrison K.A. Murphy R.C. Hinshaw J.C. Prestwich G.D. Hilaire A.S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 16015-16023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and 10 μg of p-cytomegalovirus (pCMV)-β-galactosidase plasmid as an internal control for the transfection efficiency using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Diagnostics). After the 24-h transfection, cells were treated with various PPARγ agonists or antagonists for 24 h and harvested by lysis with 900 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). A 20-μl aliquot of the lysate was used in the β-galactosidase assay, and 20 μl of the lysate was assayed using a luciferase assay kit (Promega) and counted for 10 s in a FB12 luminometer (Zylux, Oak Ridge, TN) with the data represented as the relative light unit/second. COX-2 Activity Assay—COX-2 activity assay kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells were collected by scraping and then sonicated in cold buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, containing 1 mm EDTA). The supernatant was obtained by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min. 10 μl of supernatant was mixed with 140 μl of assay buffer, 10 μl of heme, and 10 μl of COX-1 inhibitor SC-560 in triplicate wells of a 96-well plate. The plate was shaken and incubated for 5 min at 25 °C. 20 μl of colorimetric substrate and 20 μl arachidonic acid solution were then added sequentially, shaken, and incubated at 25 °C for 5 min. The absorbance was read at 590 nm using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay multiplate reader. PGE2 Immunoassay—First, 2 × 106 cells/well were seeded in a 6-well dish. After 1 day of serum starvation, cells were treated variously as described in the figure legends. The cell supernatant was extracted after an 8-h treatment. The PGE2 levels in the supernatant were quantified using an immunoassay kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 100 μl of supernatant was mixed with 50 μl of PGE2 conjugate and 50 μl of PGE2 antibody solution in each well of 96-well enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate. After 2 h of incubation on a horizontal orbital microplate shaker at 500 rpm at room temperature, each well was aspirated and washed four times with washing solution. Then, 200 μl of pNPP substrate was added and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After adding 50 μl of stop solution, the optical density of each well was measured at 405 nm with wavelength correction set at 580 nm. UV Irradiation Study—Cells were irradiated with UVB as described previously (2Dy L.C. Pei Y. Travers J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26917-26921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The UV source was a Philips F20T12/UV-B lamp (270–390 nm; containing 2.6% UVC, 43.6% UVB, 53.8% UVA). The intensity of the UVB source was measured prior to each experiment using an IL1700 radiometer and a SED240 UVB detector (International Light, Newburyport, MA) at a distance of 8 cm from the UVB source to the monolayer of cells/purified lipid. KB cells were irradiated, and the lipids were extracted as described previously (24Travers J.B. Harrison K.A. Johnson C.A. Clay K.L. Morelli J.G. Murphy R.C. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 88-94Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For the cell-free irradiation of HAPC, 1 mg of compound was dried under N2 gas on a polystyrene tissue culture plate prewashed four times with methanol. Following either sham (non-irradiation, left out on bench top open) or UVB irradiation, the lipid was removed with methanol. Structural Characterization of UVB-irradiated HAPC—An aliquot of the UVB-irradiated HAPC was analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC coupled to a tandem mass spectrometer. The column used was a Columbus 5-μm C18, 150 × 1 mm (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). The mobile phase consisted of methanol, 20 mm ammonium acetate, acetonitrile (80:15:5, v/v/v) as solvent A and methanol as solvent B. The HPLC flow rate was 0.05 ml/min, initially isocratic at 20% B for 5 min, then increased by a linear gradient to 90% B over 18 min, and then held at 90% B for 10 min. The mass spectrometer used was an API 3000 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Negative ion LC/MS/MS spectra were obtained by collisionally activating the [M-H]- ion for azPC at m/z 650.4 using nitrogen as collision gas and collision energy at -36 eV and then scanning the resultant product ions with the last quadrupole sector. Data Analysis—Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (S.D.) of at least three independent experiments. Statistical significance is assessed by the Student's t test, and significance is set as p < 0.05. Identification of Functional PPARγ Protein in Epidermal Cells—The first studies were designed to confirm that epidermal cells contain the functional PPARγ activity. RNA isolated from the human keratinocyte-derived cell line HaCaT (25Boukamp P. Petrussevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusening N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (3464) Google Scholar) and human epithelial carcinoma cell lines KB and A431 was subjected to reverse transcription-PCR for human PPARγ. One 474-bp PCR product identified as PPARγ was found in epidermal cells (Fig. 1A). Similarly, PPARγ protein was shown to be present in HaCaT, KB, and A431 cell lines (Fig. 1B). Immunoblotting also demonstrated the presence of PPARγ protein in primary cultures of human keratinocytes (not shown). To determine whether PPARγ in epidermal cells was functionally active, a PPARγ luciferase reporter assay was used (14Davies S.S. Pontsler A.V. Marathe G.K. Harrison K.A. Murphy R.C. Hinshaw J.C. Prestwich G.D. Hilaire A.S. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16015-16023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The specific PPARγ agonists, azPC and ciglitazone, activated endogenous PPARγ and induced PPARγ-dependent luciferase expression; however, the specific PPARα agonist, WY14643, had no effect (Fig. 1C). It should be noted that the PPRE reporter used does not result in high levels of promoter activity (only 2–3-fold increases), findings consistent with the use of this gene reporter system in other cell types (14Davies S.S. Pontsler A.V. Marathe G.K. Harrison K.A. Murphy R.C. Hinshaw J.C. Prestwich G.D. Hilaire A.S. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16015-16023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Augmentation of Induced COX-2 Expression by PPARγ Agonist—The biological significance of PPARγ activation was investigated by examining COX-2 expression in KB cells as this enzyme, catalyzing inflammatory prostaglandin formation, has a PPRE consensus site in its promoter (21Pontsler A.V. Hilaire A. Marathe G.K. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13029-13036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The PPARγ agonist ciglitazone did not induce COX-2 protein expression alone, but augmented COX-2 expression induced by PMA or IL-1β (Fig. 2A). Consistent with the immunoblotting studies, COX-2 enzyme activity of KB cells pretreated with ciglitazone, in the presence of PMA or IL-1β, was modestly increased (Fig. 2B). Since there was an excellent correlation between augmented protein expression identified by Western blot analysis and COX-2 enzyme activity assay, further studies relied upon the immunoblotting technique. These studies indicated that the epithelial PPARγ system can modulate induced COX-2 expression and activity. UV Irradiation of KB Cells Generates a PPARγ-agonistic Activity—The next studies were designed to assess whether the treatment of KB cells with the physiologically relevant prooxidative stressor UVB could generate a PPARγ-agonistic activity. To that end, KB cells were treated with various doses of UVB, and 1 h after irradiation, these adherent cells were scraped and sonicated to disrupt cellular membranes (Fig. 3A). Control cells were not irradiated but were scraped and sonicated similarly. The cell homogenates from control unirradiated KB cells did not contain a PPARγ-agonistic activity as shown by the lack of response when these homogenates were added back to KB cells transfected with PPARγ reporter. However, UVB irradiation of KB cells resulted in the generation of a PPARγ-agonistic activity in the homogenate in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). To define whether the PPARγ-agonistic activity found in homogenates from UVB-irradiated KB cells resided in the lipid fraction, the lipids from the cell homogenate was extracted (24Travers J.B. Harrison K.A. Johnson C.A. Clay K.L. Morelli J.G. Murphy R.C. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 88-94Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and tested for PPARγ-agonistic activity. As shown in Fig. 3C, the PPARγ-agonistic activity found in homogenates from UVB-irradiated KB cells resided in the lipid fraction. Consistent with the notion that UVB generates this lipid PPARγ-agonistic activity via oxidative stress, preincubation of KB cells with the antioxidant 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tertamethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox®) before UVB irradiation ablated the activity (Fig. 3D). It was demonstrated that Trolox® does not block the activation of PPARγ in KB cells treated with ciglitazone (data not shown). Altogether, these studies indicated that UVB irradiation generates a lipid-soluble PPARγ agonist activity via its ability to act as a prooxidative stressor. Although a minor constituent of cellular lipids, HAPC is a potential precursor for bioactive lipids produced via direct free radical oxidation of the sn-2 arachidonate (9Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A.

Among the oxidized GPCs described are the platelet-activating factor receptor agonists, 1-hexadecyl-2-butanoyl-GPC and 1-hexadecyl-2-butenoyl-GPC (7Nishi J. Ogura R. Sugiyama M. Hidaka T. Kohno M. J. Invest Dermatol. 1991; 97: 115-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the PPARγ agonist azPC (14Davies S.S. Pontsler A.V. Marathe G.K. Harrison K.A. Murphy R.C. Hinshaw J.C. Prestwich G.D. Hilaire A.S. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16015-16023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). To confirm that a considerable element of UVB-induced PPARγ-agonistic activity was non-enzymatic in origin, purified HAPC was subjected directly to UVB irradiation. As shown in Fig. 4, the lipid extracts from 2,000 J/m2 UVB-irradiated HAPC but not unirradiated HAPC contained a PPARγ agonist activity. UVB-generated PPARγ-agonistic Activity Augments PMA-induced COX-2 Expression in KB Cells—The next studies examined whether UVB irradiation of KB cells or HAPC could exert PPARγ-agonistic activity as demonstrated by its ability to augment COX-2 induction. UVB-irradiated HAPC or homogenates from UVB-irradiated KB cells, as well as PPARγ-specific agonists, azPC and ciglitazone, all augmented PMA-induced COX-2 protein expression in KB cells (Fig. 5). However, none of the above stimuli affected baseline COX-2 levels (not shown). To confirm that the augmentation of PMA-induced COX-2 expression in response to UVB-irradiated KB cells or HAPC was due to the production of a PPARγ-agonistic activity, two separate strategies were undertaken. First, the PPARγ dominant-negative cell line was created by the stable transfection of KB cells with a PPARγ dominant-negative mutant construct (22Barroso I. Gurnell M. Crowley V.E. Agostini M. Schwabe J.W. Soos M.A. Maslen G.L. Williams T.D. Lewis H. Schafer A.J. Chatterjee V.K. O'Rahilly S. Nature. 1999; 402: 880-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar, 26Gurnell M. Wentworth J.M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 5754-5759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), and a control cell line was transfected with the pcDNA3 plasmid. The stable KB/ΔPPARγ dominant-negative cells were shown to lack PPARγ activity by PPARγ-dependent luciferase reporter assay, which demonstrated the lack of luciferase reporter expression in response to ciglitazone, azPC, or PPARγ-agonistic activity existing in UVB-irradiated purified HAPC or cell homogenates from UVB-irradiated KB cells (data not shown). Neither PPARγ-specific agonists nor cellular homogenates from UVB-irradiated KB cells or UVB-irradiated HAPC were able to augment PMA-induced COX-2 expression in KB/ΔPPARγ cells expressing the mutant PPARγ dominant-negative construct (Fig. 6A). The second strategy used the specific PPARγ inhibitor GW9662 (27Bendixen A.C. Shevde N.K. Dienger K.M. Willson T.M. Funk C.D. Pike J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2443-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Consistent with the studies using the PPARγ dominant-negative mutant, pretreatment with the PPARγ antagonist GW9662 blocked the ability of ciglitazone, as well as cellular homogenates from UVB-irradiated cells or UVB-irradiated HAPC, to augment PMA-induced COX-2 expression in KB cells (Fig. 6B). Altogether, these studies confirm that UVB can generate a PPARγ-agonistic activity that can modulate COX-2 expression. UVB-generated PPARγ Activity Critical for UVB-induced PGE2 Production in KB Cells—The generation of PGE2 is among the profound effects that UVB exerts on human keratinocytes. Previous studies suggested that UVB-induced epidermal PGE2 formation is due to COX-2 (28Buckman S.Y. Gresham A. Hale P. Hruza G. Anast J. Masferrer J. Pentland A.P. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Since UVB can generate a PPARγ-agonistic activity that can modulate COX-2 expression, the next studies examined the role of this PPARγ activity in UVB-induced epidermal PGE2 production. These studies used the dual strategies of molecular and pharmacological inhibition of PPARγ with the KB/ΔPPARγ dominant-negative cell line and GW9662, respectively. As shown in Fig. 7A, PGE2 was produced in KB cells after exposure to 600 J/m2 UVB irradiation, which was reduced by the pretreatment of either the selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 (29Yamamoto T. Nozaki-Taguchi N. Brain Res. 1996; 739: 104-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) or specific PPARγ antagonist GW9662; however, neither NS-398 nor GW9662 affected PGE2 production induced by calcium ionophore A23187. Examination of the absorbance spectra of NS-398 and GW9662 revealed that these compounds did not absorb UV irradiation from 270–320 nm (data not shown), indicating that these agents did not affect UVB-mediated effects via acting as a chemical sunscreen. Similarly, UVB irradiation-induced PGE2 production was decreased in KB/ΔPPARγ dominant-negative cells in comparison with KB/pcDNA3 control cells (Fig. 7B). In contrast, PGE2 production induced by calcium ionophore A23187 was not affected by the presence of a mutant PPARγ system (Fig. 7B). These studies provide evidence that the epidermal PPARγ system is critical for optimal UVB-mediated PGE2 formation. azPC Identified in UVB-irradiated Purified HAPC—The characterization of the lipid having PPARγ-agonistic activity generated by UVB irradiation was carried out using tandem mass spectrometry. Inasmuch as UVB irradiation of both KB cells and purified HAPC resulted in the production of this activity, structural studies were carried out from product isolated from the latter cell-free model system. HPLC fractions derived from UVB-irradiated HAPC were collected and tested for PPARγ-agonistic activity using a PPARγ luciferase reporter assay. HPLC fractions (1 min) from times 8–21 min were assayed, revealing positive PPARγ-agonistic activity (greater than 150% control) in fractions 8, 10, 13, and 16–21 (Fig. 8). Commercially available azPC eluted at 16 min (Fig. 9) and thus would be expected to reside in fraction 16. The presence of this oxidized GPC with known PPARγ-agonistic activity in UVB-irradiated HAPC was determined by the analysis of tandem mass spectrometric data. Collision-induced dissociation of synthetic azPC and fraction 16 of UVB-irradiated HAPC yielded nearly identical product ions in terms of mass-to-charge ratio and abundance. Importantly, an abundant ion at m/z 201 was present in both, corresponding to the carboxylate anion of azelaic acid (Fig. 10). It should be noted that unirradiated HAPC did not exert biological activity, nor did it contain this component. These studies indicated that azPC was one component of UVB-generated PPARγ-agonistic activity.Fig. 9Identification of azPC in UVB-irradiated HAPC. Commercially available azPC (A) or UVB-irradiated HAPC (B) was subjected to negative ion LC/MS/MS operated in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode to identify peaks with this specific transition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 10Collision induced decompisition of azPC.

CID, collision-induced dissociation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These studies provide the first evidence that the epidermal PPARγ system is a biological target for UVB radiation. Our findings demonstrated the existence of a functionally active PPARγ system in epidermal cells. In PPRE-luciferase reporter assays, the specific PPARγ agonists, ciglitazone and azPC, but not the specific PPARα agonist WY14643, activated endogenous PPARγ activity. The epithelial PPARγ activation was shown to be biologically significant as it augmented COX-2 expression in response to phorbol ester or IL-1β. These findings fit with the report that a region of the COX-2 promoter contains a PPRE responsible for the enhancement of COX-2 expression (30Meade E.A. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8328-8334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Thus, epidermal cells contain a functional PPARγ system potentially linked to COX-2 expression. However, activation of PPARγ alone by ciglitazone or azPC treatment did not induce COX-2 expression in KB cells, unlike that in monocytes in which COX-2 expression was induced by rosiglitazone (21Pontsler A.V. Hilaire A. Marathe G.K. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13029-13036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We found that UVB irradiation of KB cells produced a PPARγ-agonistic activity, quantitatively similar to the specific PPARγ agonist ciglitazone. This PPARγ-agonistic activity exists in the lipid extracts from UVB-irradiated cell homogenates and is ablated by the pretreatment of cells with the antioxidant Trolox®. These findings are compatible with the notion that UVB irradiation, acting as an oxidative stressor, produced a PPARγ activity in KB cells via oxidation of cellular GPCs. It was also demonstrated that subjecting purified HAPC, a phospholipid found in epidermal cells (18Blanquart C. Barbier O. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Glineur C. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 85: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), to UVB irradiation generated a PPARγ-agonistic activity. The biological effect of UVB-induced PPARγ-agonistic activity in KB cells was evaluated by examining its effects on COX-2 expression and PGE2 production. We provide evidence that the PPARγ-agonistic activity produced in cell homogenates from UVB-irradiated cells or UVB-irradiated HAPC was functionally as active as the specific PPARγ agonist, ciglitazone, in augmenting PMA-induced COX-2 expression. The use of PPARγ dominant-negative cells, in which mutant and non-functional PPARγ is overwhelmingly expressed, as well as the specific PPARγ antagonist GW9662 confirmed the role of PPARγ in this process. UVB is known to induce epidermal COX-2 in vitro as well as in vivo (28Buckman S.Y. Gresham A. Hale P. Hruza G. Anast J. Masferrer J. Pentland A.P. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The significance of UVB-induced COX-2 is unclear but has been linked to UVB-mediated systemic immunosuppression (32Nghiem DX Kazimi N. Mitchell D.L. Vink A.A. Ananthaswamy H.N. Kripke M.L. Ullrich S.E. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2002; 119: 600-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It should be noted that a clinically relevant UVB exposure (600 J/m2) produced PGE2 in KB cells, and this was blocked by the selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398, which is consistent with the notion that COX-2 catalyzes UVB-mediated production of prostaglandins. PGE2 production in response to a physiologic (600 J/m2) dose of UVB was highly dependent on cellular PPARγ functionality, as shown by our findings that PGE2 production was dramatically decreased by the pretreatment of specific PPARγ antagonist or in PPARγ dominant-negative cells. This blockade on UVB-induced PGE2 was shown to be PPARγ-specific, in light of the evidence that GW9662 had little effect on calcium ionophore A23187, which does not exert a pro-oxidative stress. According to these studies, it is logical to extrapolate that UVB irradiation, acting as a pro-oxidative stressor, oxidized GPC-containing lipids (HAPC might be the major substrate in epidermal cells) by a free radical-mediated non-enzymatic process, resulting in biologically active lipid PPARγ agonists. These studies have begun the process of defining the exact oxidized GPCs that comprise UVB-produced PPARγ-agonistic activity. Fractionation of UVB-irradiated HAPC by HPLC revealed that several separate fractions exhibited PPARγ-agonistic activity. One fraction (16Berger J. Moller D.E. Annu. Rev. Med. 2002; 53: 409-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar) co-eluted with commercially available azPC. As shown in Fig. 9, a compound with the identical mass spectrum as azPC was identified in UVB-irradiated purified HAPC. These findings indicated that the known PPARγ agonist azPC is one of many as yet uncharacterized oxidatively modified short-chained sn-2 GPCs that have PPARγ-agonistic activity. It should be noted that although azPC is one component of UVB-generated PPARγ activity, it is probably a minor species and that potentially many other oxidized GPC species with PPARγ activity are produced by UVB. Ongoing studies are characterizing these other oxidized GPCs. The biological effects of UVB on skin are of particular interest because of the importance of UV-induced injury in the development of photoaging, skin cancer, and inflammation and the role of UV irradiation in the therapy of skin disease (reviewed in Refs. 31Trautinger F. Clin. Exper. Dermatol. 2001; 26: 573-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 33Ichihashi M. Ueda M. Budiyanto A. Bito T. Oka M. Fukunaga M. Tsuru K. Horikawa T. Toxicology. 2003; 189: 21-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar, and 34Schwarz T. Photodermal. Photoimmunol. Photomed. 2002; 18: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanisms and targets for UVB are unclear at this time. Determining the cellular and molecular mechanisms and finding novel factors that modulate inflammatory responses to acute UVB absorption in epidermal cells are important for understanding the regulation of these processes. Although many biologically relevant UVB-responsive genes including COX-2 are regulated by PPARγ, the exact significance of UVB-generated PPARγ-agonistic activity is still unclear. A better understanding of the role of oxidized GPCs in UVB responses could provide the impetus for novel pharmacological strategies involving PPARγ.

This association facilitates cyclin D1/CDK4 activity through increased nuclear retention and subunit assembly while simultaneously preventing Cip/Kip access to cyclin E-CDK2 complexes, which would result in the inhibition of the cyclin E/CDK2 kinase (9Alt J.R.

Although cyclin D1 accumulates in the nucleus during the G1 interval, it relocalizes to the cytoplasm during S phase. The essential functions of cyclin D1 require its nuclear localization, and thus the redistribution of cyclin D1 complexes to the cytoplasm following G1 implies that regulation of cyclin D1 nucleocytoplasmic distribution is necessary for maintaining cellular homeostasis. These alterations in the subcellular distribution of cyclin D1 during the cell cycle are subject to mitogenic regulation (15Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar, 16Baldin V. Lukas J. Marcote M.J. Pagano M. Draetta G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 812-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). It is now clear that phosphorylation of cyclin D1 at Thr-286 by GSK-3β promotes CRM1 binding, which then shuttles cyclin D1 to the cytoplasm (17Alt J.R. Cleveland J.L. Hannink M. Diehl J.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3102-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) for subsequent degradation via the 26S proteasome (15Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar). Although these data imply that phosphorylation of Thr-286 enables CRM1 binding, the residues within cyclin D1 that direct CRM1 binding have not been elucidated. Although cyclin D1 is overexpressed in a number of malignancies, it is clear that overexpression of the wild type protein is not by itself sufficient to induce a transformed cellular phenotype (17Alt J.R. Cleveland J.L. Hannink M. Diehl J.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3102-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 18Quelle D.E. Ashmun R.A. Shurtleff S.A. Kato J.Y. Bar-Sagi D. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1559-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). In contrast, we found previously that neither the cyclin D1 mutant, cyclin D1-T286A, nor an alternatively spliced cyclin D1 variant lacking the fifth exon can be phosphorylated by GSK-3β, and thus both are refractory to phosphorylation-dependent nuclear export and are capable of driving transformation of murine fibroblasts in the absence of a collaborating oncogene (17Alt J.R. Cleveland J.L. Hannink M. Diehl J.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3102-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 20Lu F. Gladden A.B. Diehl J.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7056-7061PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that deregulation of cyclin D1 nuclear export results in increased cyclin D1 oncogenic capacity. Herein we describe the identification of residues within cyclin D1 that direct CRM1 association. Our results demonstrate that hydrophobic residues adjacent to Thr-286 and within the C-terminal nine amino acids of cyclin D1 mediate CRM1 binding. Cell Culture Conditions and Transfections—NIH-3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing glutamine supplemented with antibiotics (Cellgro) and 10% FCS (Gemini). Procedures for manipulation of baculoviruses were described previously (21Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Tex. Agric. Exp. St. Bull. 1987; : 1555Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of D1-V290/295A mutant was achieved by using QuikChange (Stratagene), substituting valines 290 and 293 and isoleucine 295 to alanines with the following primers: forward 5′-TGCACGCCCACCGACGTGCGAGATGTGGACATC TGAGGGCCACCG-3′ and reverse 5′-CGGTGGCCCTCAGGCGTCCGCATCTCG CGCGTCGGTGGGCGT-3′. The derivation of NIH-3T3 cells overexpressing FLAG-tagged cyclin D1 and D1 mutants was as described previously (17Alt J.R. Cleveland J.L. Hannink M. Diehl J.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3102-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Cell lines were maintained on a passage protocol wherein 9 × 105 cells were passaged per 60-mm dish every third day (22Todaro G.J. Green H. J. Cell. Biol. 1963; 17: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar). Transient expression of HA-tagged GSK-3β or HA-tagged CRM1 was performed as described previously (15Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting—For Western analysis, cells were lysed in EBC buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 units/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.4 mm NaVO4, 0.4 mm NaF). Total cellular proteins (200 μg) were resolved on denaturing polyacrylamide gels, electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (MSI, Westborough, MA), and blotted with the cyclin D1 monoclonal antibody (D1-17-13G). Detection of GSK-3β was performed as described previously (15Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of Proteins—FLAG-D1 mutants were cloned into the pVDL-1393 baculoviral expression vector (Pharmingen), and virus was isolated according to established procedures as described previously (15Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar). After infection of insect Sf9 cells at high multiplicity, cells were lysed in EBC buffer and clarified by sedimentation in a microcentrifuge for 10 min. Recombinant proteins were then subjected to precipitation with epitope-specific antibodies and detected by immunoblot. Immunofluorescence—NIH-3T3 cells seeded on glass coverslips were transfected with expression vectors encoding the indicated cDNAs. Cells were fixed at 48 h after transfection using methanol-acetone (1:1). For visualization of cyclin D1, coverslips were stained with a mouse-specific cyclin D1 monoclonal antibody (D1-17-13G) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% FCS. Secondary antibody staining was performed for 30 min using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse (Amersham Biosciences). DNA was visualized using Hoescht 33258 dye at a 1:500 dilution. Coverslips were mounted on glass slides with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Protein Turnover Analysis—Equivalent numbers of NIH-3T3 cells overexpressing either FLAG-tagged wild type or mutant cyclin D1 were seeded in 10-cm dishes. The following day, cells were treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (100 μg/ml, Sigma), incubated for the indicated times, and harvested in SDS-sample buffer. Cyclin D1 was detected by Western blot analysis. Transformation Assays—NIH-3T3 cells and derivatives overexpressing the indicated cyclin D1 constructs were plated at 1.5 × 105 cells/well of a 6-well dish. Cells were cultured in medium containing 5% FCS. Foci were visualized after 21-28 days with Wright Giemsa stain (Sigma). Anchorage-independent growth of NIH-3T3, D1-3T3, D1-T286A-3T3, and D1-V290/295A was performed as described previously (17Alt J.R. Cleveland J.L. Hannink M. Diehl J.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3102-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Cyclin D1 Residues 290-295 Mediate CRM1 Binding— CRM1 directs nuclear export of target proteins via direct binding to leucine/hydrophobic stretches of amino acids referred to as a nuclear export signal (23Nigg E.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). Because phosphorylation of Thr-286 is required for CRM1 association with cyclin D1, we reasoned that phosphorylation of this residue might result in a conformational change that allows CRM1 access to a region of cyclin D1 adjacent to this site of phosphorylation. A stretch of 10 highly conserved amino acids exists within the C terminus of cyclins D1 and D2 (286TPT-DVRDVD(I/L) in cyclin D1) (24Matsushime H. Roussel M.F. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 701-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar) with the hydrophobic residues (in boldface) being conserved in cyclin D3 as well (Fig. 1A). Since both the spacing of these residues closely resembles that of other known CRM1 substrates such as cyclin B1 (25Toyoshima F. Moriguchi T. Wada A. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2728-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 26Yang J. Bardes E.S. Moore J.D. Brennan J. Powers M.A. Kornbluth S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2131-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) and a high degree of homology within this region is retained among all three D-type cyclins, we sought to evaluate the potential of these residues to mediate the cyclin D1-CRM1 association. We used site-directed mutagenesis to engineer a mutant D1-V290/295A, wherein the two valines and the isoleucine residue within residues 290-295 of cyclin D1 (VRDVDI) were mutated to alanine (ARDADA). Alanine substitutions have previously been shown to abrogate CRM1 association (27Fischer U. Huber J. Boelens W.C. Mattaj I.W. Luhrmann R. Cell. 1995; 82: 475-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar, 28Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). We first determined whether alanine substitutions abrogated cyclin D1-CRM1 binding. NIH-3T3 cells were transfected with HA-tagged CRM1 along with either FLAG-D1 as a positive control, FLAG-D1-T286A as a negative control, or FLAG-D1-V290/295A. Lysates prepared from these cells were analyzed by immunoblotting or subjected to precipitation with the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody, which recognizes the HA epitope, followed by immunoblotting with antibodies directed toward either the HA epitope or cyclin D1. Although wild type cyclin D1 co-precipitated with CRM1, consistent with previous analysis (17Alt J.R. Cleveland J.L. Hannink M. Diehl J.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3102-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 29Connor M.K. Kotchetkov R. Cariou S. Resch A. Lupetti R. Beniston R.G. Melchior F. Hengst L. Slingerland J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), neither D1-T286A nor D1-V290/295A was detected in the CRM1 precipitates (Fig. 1B). The inability of D1-V290/295A to associate with CRM1 was not due to reduced expression of this protein (lanes 4-6), suggesting that alanine substitutions within this region disrupt CRM1-D1 interaction. Overexpression of CRM1 can drive wild type cyclin D1 into the cytoplasm, whereas the phosphorylation-deficient D1-T286A mutant is refractory to the enforced nuclear export driven by CRM1 overexpression (17Alt J.R.

It stands to reason that cyclin D1 mutants deficient in CRM1 binding, such as D1-V290/295A, should be refractory to CRM1-directed nuclear export and thus constitutively nuclear. To address this possibility, we examined the subcellular localization of D1-V290/295A in asynchronously proliferating cells. The localization of cyclin D1 varied, with ∼50% of the cells exhibiting primarily nuclear localization, whereas in the remaining cells it localized either to the cytoplasm or to both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Fig. 1, C and D). This distribution of nuclear cyclin D1 approximates the percentage of cells in G1 phase in an asynchronous population (15Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar). In contrast, D1-V290/295A was nuclear in more than 90% of the cells (Fig. 1, C and D). To assess the capacity of CRM1 to regulate localization, we determined whether ectopic CRM1 could drive wild type cyclin D1 or D1-V290/295A into the cytoplasm. Whereas expression of CRM1 shuttled wild type cyclin D1 out of the nucleus (Fig. 1, C and D (quantitation)), D1-V290/295A remained nuclear in the presence or absence of ectopic CRM1 (1, C and D (quantitation)). Although these results suggest that this region of cyclin D1 mediates CRM1 binding, its close proximity to Thr-286 could disrupt GSK-3β-mediated phosphorylation and thereby indirectly disrupt CRM1 association. To examine the phosphorylation state of D1-V290/295A, we performed immunoblot analysis using an antibody specific for phosphorylated Thr-286. We have previously demonstrated that recognition of cyclin D1 by this antibody is strictly dependent upon phosphorylation of Thr-286 (17Alt J.R. Cleveland J.L. Hannink M. Diehl J.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3102-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). FLAG-D1, FLAG-D1-T286A, or FLAG-D1-V290/295A was precipitated from cells with the M2 monoclonal antibody. Although the D1-T286A mutant was not phosphorylated, both wild type cyclin D1 and D1-V290/295A were phosphorylated on Thr-286 (Fig. 2A). In fact D1-V290/295A phosphorylation was increased relative to wild type cyclin D1, suggesting decreased turnover of this mutant cyclin D1 protein (see Fig. 3). These results are consistent with the notion that hydrophobic residues between amino acids 290 and 295 direct cyclin D1-CRM1 association. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that phosphorylation of cyclin D1 at Thr-286 alone is insufficient to direct CRM1-mediated cyclin D1 nuclear export in the absence of these hydrophobic residues.Fig. 3Increased stability of constitutively nuclear cyclin D1 mutants. A, NIH-3T3 cells stably overexpressing the indicated cyclin D1 proteins were treated with cycloheximide (CHX) for the indicated intervals. Lysates prepared from the respective cells were subjected to Western analysis using the cyclin D1 monoclonal antibody. Results shown are representative of multiple independent experiments. B, wild type cyclin D1 or D1-V290/295A was precipitated from lysates prepared from cells treated with cycloheximide as indicated, and decay of phosphorylated cyclin D1 proteins was assessed by immunoblot with the phospho-T286 antibody. C, HA-ubiquitin co-transfected with either cyclin D1 or D1-V290/295A was immunoprecipitated from cells in the presence or absence of MG132, and ubiquitinated cyclin D1 was detected by Western blot. poly-Ub, poly-ubiquitin laddering.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next determined whether these alanine substitutions specifically interfere with CRM1 binding or whether they have a general effect on cyclin D1 folding that would be reflected in its capacity to associate with other known cyclin D1 interacting proteins or, alternatively, in its capacity to support CDK4 catalytic activity. We first assessed the association of D1-V290/295A with GSK-3β. We have previously demonstrated that kinase-defective GSK-3β will form stable complexes with cyclin D1 in insect Sf9 cells (15Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar). Insect Sf9 cells were infected with baculoviruses encoding kinase-defective GSK-3β along with cyclin D1, D1-T286A, or cyclin D1-V290/295A. GSK-3β-cyclin D1 complexes were isolated from lysates prepared from these cells by precipitation with a GSK-3β-specific monoclonal antibody. Immunoblot analysis confirmed the presence of D1-V290/295A within GSK-3β precipitates (Fig. 2B). Overexpression of GSK-3β will drive wild type cyclin D1 into the cytoplasm (15Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar, 17Alt J.R. Cleveland J.L. Hannink M. Diehl J.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3102-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), whereas the phosphorylation-deficient D1-T286A mutant is refractory to this enforced nuclear export. Because D1-V290/295A retained both binding to and phosphorylation by GSK-3β, it was important to determine whether D1-V290/295A was refractory to GSK-3β-mediated nuclear export. We examined the subcellular localization of cyclin D1 and D1-V290/295A in asynchronously proliferating cells transfected with GSK-3β. As shown in Fig. 2C, cyclin D1 was efficiently shuttled out of the nucleus and cytoplasmically localized in the presence of GSK-3β. In contrast, D1-V290/295A remained nuclear and is thus refractory to GSK-3β-mediated nuclear export (Fig. 2C, panels c and d). GSK-3β expression was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence in parallel (data not shown). We subsequently assessed the capacity of D1-V290/295A to associate with and activate CDK4 as well as to retain binding to p21Cip1. Similar to wild type cyclin D1 and D1-T286A, cyclin D1-V290/295A assembled with CDK4 and supported CDK4-dependent phosphorylation of Rb (data not shown). Moreover, D1-V290/295A also associated with p21Cip1 (Fig. 2D), indicating that the alanine substitutions have not significantly perturbed the structural or functional integrity of cyclin D1-V290/295A. These data support the hypothesis that residues 290-295 of cyclin D1 mediate CRM1 association and together with phosphorylated Thr-286 constitute the cyclin D1 nuclear export signal. Increased Stability of Constitutively Nuclear Cyclin D1 Mutants—Our previous work has suggested that cyclin D1 proteolysis is a cytoplasmic event. This conclusion was based on the increased stability of constitutively nuclear cyclin D1-T286A. However, it was not possible to determine the role of Thr-286 phosphorylation versus nuclear export in mediating cyclin D1 proteolysis. In characterizing D1-V290/295A, we noted that it accumulated as a Thr-286-phosphorylated protein (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 1 and 3), suggesting that phosphorylation is not sufficient to trigger proteolysis of this nuclear protein. Using cycloheximide to inhibit nascent protein synthesis (30Rimerman R.A. Gellert-Randleman A. Diehl J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14736-14742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), we investigated the rate of D1-V290/295A degradation versus that of either wild type cyclin D1 or the D1-T286A mutant (Fig. 3A). Our results revealed that both D1-V290/295A and D1-T286A have increased protein stability in comparison with wild type cyclin D1. To confirm reduced Thr-286 proteolysis of phosphorylated D1-V290/295A, we measured decay of phosphorylated isoforms of wild type cyclin D1 and D1-V290/295A. Although the half-life of Thr-286 phosphorylated cyclin D1 was less than 15 min, the half-life of phospho-D1-V290/295A was greatly extended (Fig. 3B). Moreover, to corroborate the increased stability of D1-V290/295A relative to wild type cyclin D1, we assessed ubiquitination of cyclin D1 versus D1-V290/295A. Either wild type or D1-V290/295A was co-transfected with HA-ubiquitin into NIH-3T3 cells. Transfected cells were treated with either vehicle or MG132 to inhibit the 26 S proteasome. Cells were then harvested, and lysates were subjected to immunoblotting with the cyclin D1 monoclonal antibody (Fig. 3C). Wild type cyclin D1 alone exhibited the characteristic poly-ubiquitin laddering (poly-Ub) recognized for ubiquitinated proteins in the presence of MG132 (Fig. 3C, lane 2). No higher molecular weight isoforms of D1-V290/295A were detected either in the presence or absence of MG132. These data demonstrate that disruption of CRM1 association promotes the accumulation of Thr-286 phosphorylated cyclin D1 that is inaccessible to and consequently not degraded via cytoplasmic 26 S proteasomes. Loss of CRM1 Binding Increases the Transforming Potential of Cyclin D1—Cells engineered to overexpress cyclin D1 display a contracted G1 interval (18Quelle D.E. Ashmun R.A. Shurtleff S.A. Kato J.Y. Bar-Sagi D. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1559-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). These cells, however, do not form foci, grow in soft agar, or promote tumor formation in immunocompromised mice (18Quelle D.E. Ashmun R.A. Shurtleff S.A. Kato J.Y. Bar-Sagi D. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1559-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). As shown previously in our laboratory, a cyclin D1 mutant that cannot be phosphorylated at Thr-286 and is thus constitutively nuclear promotes cellular transformation (17Alt J.R. Cleveland J.L. Hannink M. Diehl J.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3102-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). This result suggests that disruption of cyclin D1 nuclear export is an oncogenic event. We therefore considered the possibility that the D1-V290/295A mutant, which unlike D1-T286A retains phosphorylation at Thr-286, might exhibit an increased potential to drive cell transformation relative to wild type cyclin D1. For these experiments NIH-3T3 cells were co-transfected with vectors encoding either wild type FLAG-tagged cyclin D1 or the specified cyclin D1 mutant and a vector encoding puromycin as a selectable marker. Transfectants selected in puromycin were then pooled to eliminate potential clonal variation when assessing transformation. NIH-3T3 cells (data not shown) or NIH-3T3 derivatives engineered to overexpress either wild type FLAG-tagged or mutant cyclin D1 isoforms were assayed for characteristics of cell transformation: foci formation (refractory to contact inhibition) and growth in soft agar (capable of anchorage-independent growth). Over the course of five independent experiments, all NIH-3T3 cells overexpressing the C-terminal cyclin D1 mutants D1-T286A and D1-V290/295A reproducibly formed numerous foci (Fig. 4A; data not shown). Consistent with these results, unlike wild type NIH-3T3 (data not shown) and D1-3T3 cells, which were incapable of significant growth in soft agar, NIH-3T3 cell lines overexpressing constitutively nuclear C-terminal cyclin D1 mutants D1-T286A (used as positive control) and D1-V290/295A reproducibly grew in soft agar, forming numerous and robust colonies (Fig. 4, B and C (quantitation)). Our data support the model wherein mutations in the CRM1 binding site and/or loss of Thr-286 phosphorylation in wild type cyclin D1 leads to a constitutively nuclear cyclin D1 with increased capacity to drive neoplastic transformation and, as a result, a loss in G1/S homeostasis (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Cell transformation results from inhibition of cyclin D1 nuclear export. Wild type cyclin D1 is phosphorylated at Thr-286 (circled “P”) in late G1 phase, allowing for CRM1 recognition and binding that triggers the rapid nuclear export of cyclin D1-CDK4 complexes in S phase (top). Mutation of phosphorylatable Thr-286 or mutations directly within the CRM1 binding site of cyclin D1 results in abrogated CRM1 binding and inhibition of cyclin D1 nuclear export. Expression of constitutively nuclear C-terminal cyclin D1 mutants results in cellular transformation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cyclin D1 localization is driven by the competing processes of nuclear import and export. Although the mechanisms of cyclin D1 nuclear import remain poorly characterized, it is now clear that CRM1-dependent nuclear export drives cyclin D1 complexes into the cytoplasm during S phase. CRM1 directs nuclear export of target proteins via direct binding to leucine/hydrophobic stretches of amino acids. However, the exact spacing of the leucine/hydrophobic patch is variable making it difficult to identify CRM1 binding sites by scanning the primary sequence of a given putative substrate. Although two stretches of residues closely conformed to previously documented nuclear export signal motifs, residues 87-94 (RFLSLEPL) and residues 290-295, the 290-295 sequence was an attractive target given its proximity to the site of GSK-3β-mediated phosphorylation, Thr-286, and its highly conserved nature among all three D-type cyclins. Mutation of valines and isoleucines to alanines in this region abrogates CRM1 binding and promotes nuclear retention without perturbing phosphorylation of Thr-286. This mutant, D1-V290/295A, accumulates in the nucleus as a Thr-286-phosphorylated protein. In contrast, the phosphorylated form of wild type cyclin D1 is highly labile and is detectable in the cytoplasm (9Alt J.R. Gladden A.B. Diehl J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8517-8523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data identify residues 290-295 as the CRM1 binding site in cyclin D1. Our data demonstrate that a hydrophobic patch within the C terminus of cyclin D1 mediates CRM1 binding. Mutations within this region do not perturb GSK-3β-mediated phosphorylation of cyclin D1 at Thr-286, a modification that increases the propensity for CRM1 recognition and binding. As our results indicate, however, phosphorylation in itself is insufficient for cyclin D1 nuclear export or degradation, which is consistent with cytoplasmic proteolysis of cyclin D1. Thus, in the absence of an intact CRM1 binding site, CRM1 fails to associate with cyclin D1, and the resulting protein is more stabile and constitutively nuclear. These data suggest that the C terminus of cyclin D1 is a critical modulator of cyclin D1 nuclear export and might therefore represent a potential “hot spot” for the activation of mutations in cyclin D1 that ultimately contribute to cancer genesis. In support of this notion, we have recently identified a splice variant of cyclin D1, referred to as cyclin D1b, which lacks the C-terminal residues that direct GSK-3β phosphorylation and CRM1-dependent nuclear export (20Lu F. Gladden A.B. Diehl J.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7056-7061PubMed Google Scholar). As with D1-V290/295A described herein, cyclin D1b is constitutively nuclear and can drive cell transformation (20Lu F. Gladden A.B. Diehl J.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7056-7061PubMed Google Scholar, 31Solomon D.A. Wang Y. Fox S.R. Lambeck T.C. Giesting S. Lan Z. Senderowicz A.M. Knudsen E.S. J. Biol.

Furthermore, we have found that this protein is expressed in a significant fraction of primary cancers, highlighting the significance of maintaining temporal control of cyclin D1 subcellular localization for normal cell growth and proliferation (20Lu F. Gladden A.B. Diehl J.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7056-7061PubMed Google Scholar). We thank C. J. Sherr for providing NIH-3T3 cells and J. Woodgett for GSK-3β cDNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2046510001,"Rho GDP dissociation inhibitors (rhoGDIs) are postulated to regulate the activity of small G proteins of the Rho family by a shuttling process involving the extraction of Rho from donor membranes, the formation of the inhibitory cytosolic Rho/rhoGDI complexes, and delivery of Rho to target membranes. However, the role of rhoGDIs in site-specific membrane targeting or extraction of Rho is still poorly understood. Here we investigated the molecular functions of two rhoGDIs, the specific rhoGDI-3 and the less specific but well studied rhoGDI-1, in HeLa cells using structure-based mutagenesis of the rhoGDI protein. We identified two sites in rhoGDI, which form conserved interactions with their Rho target, whose mutation results in the uncoupling of inhibitory and shuttling functions of rhoGDIs: D66GDI-3 (equivalent to D45GDI-1), a conserved residue in the helix-loop-helixGDI/switch 1Rho interface, and D206GDI-3 (equivalent to D185GDI-1) in the β-sandwichGDI/switch 2Rho interface. Mutations of both sites result in the loss of rhoGDI-3 or rhoGDI-1 inhibitory activity but not of their ability to form cytosolic complexes with RhoG or Cdc42 in vivo. Remarkably, the mutants were detected at Rho-induced membrane ruffles or protrusions where they co-localized with RhoG or Cdc42, likely identifying for the first time the site of extraction of a Rho protein by a rhoGDI in vivo. We propose that these mutations act by modifying the steady-state kinetics of the shuttling process regulated by rhoGDIs, such that transient steps at the cell membranes now become detectable. They should provide valuable tools for future investigations of the dynamics of membrane extraction or delivery of Rho proteins and their regulation by cellular partners.

Small G proteins of the Rho family regulate many aspects in the normal cell such as polarity, motility, vesicular traffic, cell cycle progression, and Ras-mediated cell transformation (1Bar-Sagi D.

Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 238-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and cancer development and progression through their upregulation rather than activating point mutations in contrast to Ras proteins (5Sahai E.

Mokbel K. Mansel R.E. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 6432-6440PubMed Google Scholar). Rho proteins function as molecular switches, combining a GDP/GTP and a cytosol/membrane alternation. The GDP/GTP switch is controlled by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; rhoGDI, Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor; wt, wild type; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; DO, dropout medium; BD, binding domain; ERM, Ezrin, Radixin, Moesin, and Merlin. and GTPase-activating proteins and determines the conformational differences between inactive and active Rho proteins, while the cytosol/membrane alternation is regulated by Rho GDP dissociation inhibitors (rhoGDIs). RhoGDIs are postulated to function in this cycle by shuttling Rho proteins between membranes, where these proteins are attached by an isoprenoid moiety located in their C terminus, and the cytosol (for a review, see Ref. 8Olofsson B. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). This cyclic activity involves the extraction of Rho proteins from a donor membrane, the formation of a cytosolic Rho/rhoGDI complex, and the delivery to a target membrane. Whether rhoGDIs act in this process as subsidiary transporters of inactivated Rho proteins or as essential actors for Rho activity is currently being debated (9Gibson R. Wilson-Delfosse A. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 10Lin Q. Fuji R. Yang W. Cerione R. Curr.

J. 2004; 378: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). An essential role of rhoGDI is supported by the observation that the Rac1/rhoGDI-1 complex is crucial for Rac1-mediated regulation of the NADPH oxidase system in neutrophils (12Di-Poi N. Faure J. Grizot S. Molnar G. Pick E. Dagher M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10014-10022Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and that rhoGDI-1 appears to be critical for Cdc42-mediated cellular transformation (10Lin Q. Fuji R. Yang W. Cerione R. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1469-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A subsidiary role was in contrast suggested by the fact that nascent prenylated Cdc42 mutant, unable to bind to rhoGDI-1, could target to Golgi membranes and be activated to induce filopodia (9Gibson R. Wilson-Delfosse A. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and that an activated mutant of Rac1 stimulates membrane ruffling in rhoGDI-1(-/-) cells (11Gandhi P. Gibson R. Tong X. Miyoshi J. Takai Y. Konieczkowski M. Sedor J. Wilson-Delfosse A. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Yet the most studied rhoGDIs (rhoGDI-1 and D4/LyGDI) have never been observed in vivo at their sites of extraction or delivery, making their mechanism and its coordination with the action of other Rho regulators difficult to elucidate. Most studies of membrane extraction and delivery have so far involved in vitro experiments. Delivery of Rac1 to membranes was analyzed using reconstituted isoprenylated Rac1/rhoGDI-1 complexes in the presence of liposomes, showing that Rac1 must dissociate from rhoGDI-1 prior to its activation by its GEF Tiam and that this delivery does not involve the GEF (13Robbe K. Otto-Bruc A. Chardin P. Antonny B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4756-4762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This role of rhoGDI as an inhibitor of GEF-stimulated GDP/GTP exchange is also supported by the crystal structures of Rho/rhoGDI complexes where the binding site for the GEF overlaps the interface for rhoGDI (14Snyder J.

Structural studies also show that rhoGDI has a modular organization with an N-terminal helix-loop-helix domain that binds to the switch 1, which appears to fold only upon binding to the Rho protein (18Gosser Y.Q.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1744-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), suggested that the molecular activity of rhoGDIs could be separated into the recognition of the Rho protein through its nucleotide-sensitive switch regions and a step of extraction of the isoprenyl group from the membrane. Various studies support that extraction from and delivery to membranes of Rho proteins by rhoGDIs in vivo may be assisted by additional regulations. This includes the phosphorylation of Cdc42 or RhoA proteins by protein kinase A, which facilitates their extraction by rhoGDI-1 (21Lang P.F. Gesbert M. Delespine-Carmagnat R. Stancou R. Pouchelet M.

Cell. 2004; 15: 117-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), which facilitates the dissociation of Rac from rhoGDI-1 and its delivery to membranes. Likewise, a set of investigations suggests that several cellular components could act as displacement factors to release Rho proteins from rhoGDI, permitting membrane targeting and activation of Rho. Recent experiments show that direct interaction of rhoGDI-1 with the neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) initiates the activation of RhoA by facilitating the release of prenylated RhoA from rhoGDI-1 (26Yamashita T. Tohyama M. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). In addition, the tyrosine kinase Etk disrupts the interaction between RhoA and rhoGDI-1 through the interaction between the pleckstrin homology domain of Etk and RhoA (27Kim O. Yang J. Qiu Y. J.

While structural data have provided a robust background for investigating the Rho-rhoGDI interactions by mutagenesis, in vivo studies of rhoGDI mutants are made difficult because the rhoGDI family has only three members as compared with at least 20 Rho family members. Notably rhoGDI-1 (referred to as GDI-1 hereafter) and D4/LyGDI (also named rhoGDI-2) have a broad range of activity toward several Rho proteins in vivo (8Olofsson B. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 32Fukumoto Y. Kaibuchi K. Hori Y. Fujioka H. Araki S. Ueda T. Kikuchi A. Takai Y.

Accordingly the cellular effects of these rhoGDIs and their mutants could be difficult to interpret as several Rho targets are likely to be affected. However, we identified and characterized a third mammalian rhoGDI (rhoGDI-3 or rhoGDIγ) (34Zalcman G. Closson V. Camonis J. Honore N. Rousseau-Merck M.F. Tavitian A. Olofsson B. J. Biol.

Traffic. 2002; 3: 342-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Expression of RhoGDI-3wt (referred to as GDI-3 hereafter) was shown to inhibit the phenotypes associated with activated RhoG (36Brunet N. Morin A. Olofsson B. Traffic. 2002; 3: 342-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), which include the translocation of RhoG to the cell periphery and the formation of ruffles and lamellipodia (37Gauthier-Rouviere C. Vignal E. Meriane M. Roux P. Montcourier P. Fort P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1379-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 38Blangy A. Vignal E. Schmidt S. Debant A. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Fort P. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 729-739Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, although it forms soluble complexes with RhoG, GDI-3 is also able to sequester RhoG at the Golgi where both proteins co-localize (36Brunet N. Morin A. Olofsson B. Traffic. 2002; 3: 342-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This is likely to be the site of RhoG delivery by GDI-3 as RhoG was found to be activated by its GEF at the perinuclear region (38Blangy A. Vignal E. Schmidt S. Debant A. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Fort P. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 729-739Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GDI-3 has a 25-amino acid extension at its N terminus compared with rhoGDI-1 and D4/LyGDI that is responsible for its unconventional ability to target itself and RhoG to the Golgi apparatus (34Zalcman G. Closson V. Camonis J. Honore N. Rousseau-Merck M.F. Tavitian A. Olofsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30366-30374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 36Brunet N. Morin A. Olofsson B. Traffic. 2002; 3: 342-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Here we report a structure-based mutagenesis study of GDI-3 in HeLa cells, taking advantage of the fact that GDI-3 is the most specific rhoGDI regulator known to date and that the RhoG/GDI-3 system presents a unique readout of its activity in vivo. Mutations were introduced to interfere with GDI-3 interactions with the switch 1 and switch 2 regions of RhoG, and GDI-3 mutants were analyzed for their ability to inhibit RhoG-induced phenotypes, that is formation of membrane ruffles and detection of RhoG at the cell periphery. They were also analyzed for their ability to form cytosolic complexes. We identified two invariant residues, which form conserved interactions with Rho whose mutation results in the loss of GDI-3 inhibitory activity but not of its ability to interact with RhoG. Remarkably these mutants could be detected at RhoG-induced membrane protrusions where they co-localized with RhoG, likely identifying for the first time the site of extraction of a Rho protein by a rhoGDI in vivo. Equivalent mutations introduced in GDI-1 and assayed in co-expression with wild type Cdc42 resulted in a similar loss of GDI-1 inhibitory activity, despite their ability to form cytosolic complexes, and in a displacement of GDI-1 mutants to Cdc42-induced membrane protrusions. We propose that these novel mutations act by modifying the steady-state kinetics of the shuttling process regulated by rhoGDIs such that the transient extraction step now becomes detectable. They should provide valuable tools for future investigations of the dynamics of membrane extraction or delivery of Rho proteins and their regulation by cellular partners. Materials—Monoclonal antibodies against Myc and HA epitopes were from Sigma (clone 9E10 and HA-7, respectively). The secondary antibodies against mouse IgG or rabbit IgG linked to horseradish peroxidase were from Amersham Biosciences. The secondary immunoreagents Alexa Fluor 647 and 488 were from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). The Dynabeads (goat anti-mouse IgG) were purchased from Dynal (Compiègne, France). Restriction endonucleases for molecular biology were from New England Biolabs. Mutations were performed using the Pfu Turbo polymerase, nucleotide mixtures, and buffers from Stratagene. DNA Constructs—For expression in eukaryotic cells, the GDI-3 sequence containing a Myc tag at the C terminus was cloned in the pCDNA3.1Zeo(+) plasmid (Invitrogen) as described previously (36Brunet N. Morin A. Olofsson B. Traffic. 2002; 3: 342-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). GDI-1 was cloned in pcS3Myc1 vector to obtain a protein with a Myc tag at the N terminus. GDI-3 and GDI-1 point mutations were generated by the QuikChange method using the iCycler™ from Bio-Rad with primers designed to insert mutations at the desired position. The pCDNA3.1-RhoG(wt) was a generous gift of P. Fort (Centre de Recherches de Biochimie Macromoléculaire, CNRS, Montpellier, France). pFBL23-RalB and pGAD1318-RalBD yeast expression clones were kind gifts of J. Camonis (Institut Curie, Paris, France). The yeast expression vectors containing Cdc42 and GDI-1 were kind gifts of M.-C. Dagher (Laboratoire de Biochimie et Biophysique des Systèmes Intégrés, Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique, Grenoble, France). For expression in HeLa cells, Cdc42 cDNA was subcloned into the pCDNA3.1 plasmid. Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa cells were grown on 100-mm tissue dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotic/antimycotic mixture (Invitrogen) as described in Ref. 36Brunet N. Morin A. Olofsson B. Traffic. 2002; 3: 342-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar. Cells were transfected by electroporation as explained previously (39Morin A. Picart R. Tixier-Vidal A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 117: 59-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly cells from subconfluent cultures were harvested using trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen) and washed once using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium followed by a second wash in cytomix solution (120 mm KCl, 0.15 mm CaCl2, 10mm K2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 7.6, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 5 mm glutathione). For each electroporation pulse, cells were resuspended in 100 μlof cytomix solution containing 20 μg of each expression vector, then gently spread into 100-mm culture dishes, and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. In the case of GDI-1 and Cdc42 expression vectors, 20 μg of HA-Cdc42 vector but only 10 μg of the MycGDI-1wt vector was used as an amount of 20 μg turned out to be toxic for the cells. Consequently the same amount of GDI-1 mutants was used. For immunofluorescence studies, transfected cells were plated in individual wells on Labtek multichamber glass slides (VWR International). Subcellular Fractionation and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection using trypsin/EDTA, washed with PBS, and homogenized at 4 °C in 500 μl of TMD buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and a mixture of proteases inhibitors) complemented with 0.25 m sucrose. Nuclei and cellular debris were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the resulting postnuclear supernatant was fractionated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to obtain the cytosolic fraction (S100) and the membrane-containing pellet (P100). For subcellular fractionation studies, the S100 fraction was concentrated, and proteins were denatured by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer. The P100 fraction was directly resuspended and denatured by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer. Immunoisolation experiments were performed on the cytosolic fraction S100 using Dynal magnetic beads, Dynabeads (M450) coated with goat anti-mouse IgG, as described previously (36Brunet N. Morin A. Olofsson B. Traffic. 2002; 3: 342-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Bound and unbound components from each fraction were denatured by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer. Electrophoresis and Western Blot—Proteins contained in S100, P100 fractions, and immunocomplexes were subjected to 13% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred onto Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Immobilized proteins were analyzed by immunodetection using specific primary antibody (diluted from 1:2500 to 1:5000 as indicated) in Blotto (1% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20) followed by binding of the appropriate (anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG) horseradish peroxidase-labeled reporter antibody (diluted 1:10,000). For detection, SuperSignalWestPico (Pierce) was used. Densitometric analysis of autoradiographic films were performed with NIH ImageJ Version1.30 software. Fluorescence Microscopy—For immunofluorescence studies, transfected cells grown on Labtek glass sides were fixed 24 h after transfection for 10 min with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature. Fixed cells were glycinated and permeabilized with 0.25% saponin for 5 min followed by PBS washes. Slides were preblocked with 5% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20, and 0.01% saponin in PBS. Incubations with anti-Myc mouse monoclonal antibody (1:400) and anti-HA rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:200) were performed in PBS containing 0.25% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% Tween, and 0.01% saponin overnight at 4 °C. Staining with secondary antibody was carried out for 20 min at room temperature using Alexa Fluor 647 anti-mouse IgG (1:500) and Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rabbit IgG (1:800). The Golgi apparatus was stained with FITC-labeled lectin from Lens culinaris (Sigma) as described previously (9Gibson R. Wilson-Delfosse A. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, after staining with secondary antibody, fixed cells were incubated with a 2 μg/ml FITC-labeled lectin solution for 30 min and then washed with PBS. Confocal laser-scanning microscopy was performed using a Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscope using objective HCX Plan Apo CS 63× numerical aperture 1.40. Analysis of Protein-Protein Interactions Using Yeast Mating Strategy—The yeast mating assay was performed using L40 (MATa) and AMR70 (MATα) host strains. Yeasts were transformed according to the lithium acetate protocol and grown at 30 °C in appropriate complete dropout medium (DO). The L40 yeast strain was transfected with pFBL23 plasmids containing either GDI-3wt or GDI-3 mutant cDNAs and grown in DO minus tryptophan. The AMR70 yeast strain was transfected with pGAD1318 plasmids containing the RhoG coding sequence and grown in DO minus leucine. L40 transfected cells were mated with AMR70 transfected cells. Diploid cells were selected on DO minus tryptophan and leucine agar and then patched on Whatmann filters to be processed for β-galactosidase activity. Diploids were also tested for histidine prototrophy by selective growth after replication on DO minus tryptophan, leucine, and histidine agar. pFBL23 containing the RalB coding sequence and pGAD1318 containing a Ral binding domain (RalBD) sequence were used as positive control vectors, whereas pFBL23 and pGAD1318 without any insert were used as negative control vectors. The ability of a LexA-fused protein to interact with a protein fused to the GAL4 activation domain was taken into account only when both LacZ and HIS3 reporter genes were activated in the yeast mating assay. Structure-based Mutagenesis of GDI-3—The RhoG/GDI-3 system was selected for a mutagenesis study of the interactions between the rhoGDI domains and the Rho proteins because it provides a specific phenotypic readout of GDI activity and Rho activation together with limited cellular toxicity upon overexpression (36Brunet N. Morin A. Olofsson B. Traffic. 2002; 3: 342-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Since the structure of the RhoG/GDI-3 complex is not known, we took advantage of the high sequence identity between GDI-3 and GDI-1 (65% taking into account the helix-loop-helix module and the β-sandwich domains) and RhoG and Cdc42 (61%) to generate a model of the complex based on the high resolution crystal structure of the Cdc42/GDI-1 complex (15Hoffman G.R. Nassar N. Cerione R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The model was generated with the 3DPSSM server (www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/~3dpssm/) and restricted to conserved structured domains, excluding the specific N-terminal extension of GDI-3. Remarkably, despite the specificity of GDI-3 for RhoG, amino acids that form its interface with the core of RhoG are essentially identical to those in the Cdc42/GDI-1 complex except for the substitution of Pro-69Cdc42 for Thr-69RhoG in the switch 2 domain. In contrast, residues in GDI-3 that differ from GDI-1 are mostly exposed to solvent, which is particularly striking in the helix-loop-helix module whose Rho-interacting side is invariant with regard to GDI-1 and has almost no residue in common in its exposed face. Whether these differences reflect interactions with distinct partners remains to be established. The high conservation of residues within the RhoG/GDI-3 interface ensures on the other hand that their interactions are reliably predicted in the homology model. Three locations were therefore targeted for mutagenesis on the basis of the model (Fig. 1). First, mutations were introduced at Asp-66GDI-3 (equivalent to Asp-45 in GDI-1) in the helix-loop-helix module to disrupt its interactions with the switch 1 of RhoG. Asp-66GDI-3 forms a hydrogen bond with Thr-35RhoG, a residue that is conserved in most small GTP-binding proteins where its interactions with GTP and its associated Mg2+ ion act as springs to organize the active conformation (40Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Science. 2001; 294: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1395) Google Scholar). This ThrRho/AspGDI hydrogen bond, observed in all three Rho/RhoGDI crystal structures, was therefore regarded as a determinant of the preference of RhoGDIs for the GDP-bound form of Rho proteins (15Hoffman G.R. Nassar N. Cerione R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Asp-66GDI-3 was mutated to alanine either alone or with an additional S68IGDI-3 mutation (Ser-47GDI-1), a residue that establishes a set of hydrogen bonds with the main chain of Ile-36RhoG.Fig. 1Structure-based mutagenesis of GDI-3. Shown are a model of the RhoG/GDI-3 complex (A) and close-up views of the Asp-66 (B), Arg-159/Lys-162 (C), and Asp-206 (D) mutated sites.

Asp-206GDI-3 was changed to either alanine to remove a salt bridge with Arg-66RhoG from the switch 2 or isoleucine to create an additional steric hindrance. This mutation is the counterpart on GDI of the mutation of Arg-66Cdc42 to glutamate or alanine, which prevented Cdc42 from forming stable cytosolic complexes with GDI-1 and from being removed from membranes (9Gibson R. Wilson-Delfosse A. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 10Lin Q. Fuji R. Yang W. Cerione R. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1469-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, Arg-66Cdc42 is involved in multiple interactions with GEFs, GTPase-activating proteins, and"
https://openalex.org/W1990024993,"Topological studies of multi-spanning membrane proteins commonly use sequentially truncated proteins fused to a C-terminal translocation reporter to deduce transmembrane (TM) segment orientation and key biogenesis events. Because these truncated proteins represent an incomplete stage of synthesis, they transiently populate intermediate folding states that may or may not reflect topology of the mature protein. For example, in Xenopus oocytes, the aquaporin-1 (AQP1) water channel is cotranslationally directed into a four membrane-spanning intermediate, which matures into the six membrane-spanning topology at a late stage of synthesis (Skach, W. R., Shi, L. B., Calayag, M. C., Frigeri, A., Lingappa, V. R., and Verkman, A. S. (1994) J. Cell Biol. 125, 803–815 and Lu, Y., Turnbull, I. R., Bragin, A., Carveth, K., Verkman, A. S., and Skach, W. R. (2000) Mol. Biol. Cell 11, 2973–2985). The hallmark of this process is that TM3 initially acquires an Nexo/Ccyto (Type I) topology and must rotate 180° to acquire its mature orientation. In contrast, recent studies in HEK-293 cells have suggested that TM3 acquires its mature topology cotranslationally without the need for reorientation (Dohke, Y., and Turner, R. J. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 15215–15219). Here we re-examine AQP1 biogenesis and show that irrespective of the reporter or fusion site used, oocytes and mammalian cells yielded similar topologic results. AQP1 intermediates containing the first three TM segments generated two distinct cohorts of polypeptides in which TM3 spanned the ER membrane in either an Ncyto/Cexo (mature) or Nexo/Ccyto (immature) topology. Pulse-chase analyses revealed that the immature form was predominant immediately after synthesis but that it was rapidly degraded via the proteasome-mediated endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD) pathway with a half-life of less than 25 min in HEK cells. As a result, the mature topology predominated at later time points. We conclude that (i) differential stability of biogenesis intermediates is an important factor for in vivo topological analysis of truncated chimeric proteins and (ii) cotranslational events of AQP1 biogenesis reflect a common AQP1 folding pathway in diverse expression systems.

One example of the post-translational model occurs during the biogenesis of aquaporin-1 (AQP1), a hydrophobic membrane protein of ∼29 kDa that exists as a homo-tetramer in cell membranes. AQP1 is a member of the MIP (major intrinsic protein) family (17Fujiyoshi Y. Mitsuoka K. de Groot B.L. Philippsen A. Grubmèuller H. Agre P. Engel A. Curr. Opin. Struct.

In its mature form it exhibits a characteristic topology with six TM segments and two additional short helical regions flanked by conserved NPA motifs that fold inward within the plane of the membrane to form a monomeric, water-selective pore (19Fu D.

Early biogenesis studies of AQP1 in cell-free systems and microinjected Xenopus oocytes revealed a novel mechanism in which only four of its six transmembrane segments cotranslationally acquired a membrane spanning topology (22Skach W.R.

Skach W.R. Ma T. Verkman A.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8250-8256Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), in part because hydrophilic residues within the N terminus of TM2 (Asn49 and Lys51) disrupt stop transfer sequence and allow TM2 to transiently pass through the translocon and into the ER lumen (24Foster W.

As a result, when TM3 emerges from the ribosome, it acts as a stop transfer sequence to terminate translocation and cotranslationally adopt an Nexo/Ccyto (Type I) topology. A four-spanning intermediate is synthesized because TM4 does not reinitiate translocation, and TM5 and TM6 act as signal and stop transfer sequences, respectively (see Fig. 1A). The defining feature of this folding intermediate is that TM3 is initially oriented with its C terminus positioned in the cytosol. In Xenopus oocytes, TM3 topology is “corrected,” because it rotates 180° about the plane of the membrane to acquire its mature topology during a later stage or following the completion of AQP1 synthesis (23Lu Y.

Topology of reporter fusion sites used for experiments in Xenopus oocytes (A) and HEK-293 cells (B) are indicated. Fusion sites in which topology differs between these systems are shown in black, whereas fusion sites with the same topology are shown in gray. In oocytes AQP1 is initially synthesized as a four-spanning intermediate that is converted into the mature six-spanning form. In HEK-293 cells the reporter did not identify the immature topology (26Dohke Y. Turner R.J. J. Biol.

Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15215-15219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A study by the Turner group (26Dohke Y. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15215-15219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) examined the topology of truncated constructs in which variable numbers of AQP1 TM segments were placed into a chimeric protein containing N- and C-terminal reporter domains derived from EGFP and the β-subunit of the H/K-ATPase, respectively. The topology of TM segments was inferred by N-linked glycosylation of the C-terminal reporter in intact HEK-293 cells. In contrast to results in oocytes, the Turner group found that TM3 had already acquired its mature Ncyt/Cexo topology (e.g. the reporter was glycosylated) in constructs containing only the first three AQP1 TM segments and concluded that AQP1 biogenesis therefore occurs in a cotranslational fashion without reorientation from a four-spanning intermediate. These studies have lead to several unanswered questions regarding AQP1 biogenesis. Different reporter domains (prolactin versus H/K-ATPase β-subunit derivatives), translocation assays (protease protection versus glycosylation) and fusion sites could potentially account for the different apparent topology observed for TM3. Because C-terminal reporters are routinely used to study polytopic protein biogenesis, these factors are of more than just academic interest. In addition, although truncated proteins provide important structural information at a relatively defined point of synthesis, they lack C-terminal sequence information and therefore must be viewed as populating intermediate folding states. As such they are potential candidates for recognition by ER quality control machinery. Consistent with this we had previously observed that certain AQP1 fusion proteins are relatively unstable in oocytes (27Skach W.R. Verkman A.S. Biophysical J. 1995; 68: A334Google Scholar). A final possibility proposed by the Turner group is that oocytes and mammalian cells handle topological information in fundamentally different ways. If true, this would have major implications for protein biogenesis. Xenopus oocytes efficiently express diverse aquaporins and have been extensively used to study AQP biosynthesis, trafficking, and function (28Tamarappoo B.K. Verkman A.S. J. Clin.

However, a direct comparison of biosynthetic mechanisms in oocyte and mammalian cells has not previously been carried out. We therefore systematically examined AQP1 fusion proteins containing two, three, or four TM segments in both Xenopus oocytes and HEK-293 cells to determine the origin of previous discrepancies. We now show that irrespective of the reporter or fusion site examined, both systems yielded similar topologic results. AQP1 intermediates containing the first three TM segments gave rise to two distinct cohorts of polypeptides in which TM3 spanned the ER membrane in either an Ncyto/Cexo (mature) or Nexo/Ccyto (immature) topology. Careful pulse-chase analyses revealed that the immature form predominated immediately after synthesis in both cell types but that it was rapidly degraded via the proteasome-mediated ERAD pathway. As a result, the mature topology predominated 1–2 h after synthesis in HEK cells. We conclude that differential stability of biogenesis intermediates is an important factor for in vivo analysis of truncated chimeric proteins and that cotranslational events of AQP1 biogenesis are conserved in diverse expression systems. cDNA Construction—Plasmids AQP1P77.P, AQP1L139.P, and AQP1P169.P are described previously as clones 3, 6, and 7 (22Skach W.R.

The constructs encode AQP1 residues 1–66, 1–77, 1–139, 1–164, or 1–169 flanked by EGFP and β-subunit. The full-length AQP1 construct was generated by ligating AQP1 cDNA into the mammalian expression vector pEGFP-N3 (Clontech) between the HindIII and NotI restriction sites resulting in a full-length AQP1 construct without an EGFP tag. The sequence of all PCR-amplified DNA was verified by automated DNA sequencing. Xenopus laevis Expression—mRNA was transcribed in vitro with SP6 RNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) using 2 μg of plasmid DNA in a 10-μl volume at 40 °C for 1 h as previously described (22Skach W.R.

The aliquots were used immediately or frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. 2 μl of transcript was mixed with 50 μCi of [35S]methionine (0.5 μl of a 10× concentrated Tran35S-label; ICN Pharmaceuticals, Irvine, CA), and 50 nl was injected into stage VI X. laevis oocytes (50 nl/oocyte) on an ice-cold stage. The oocytes were incubated at 18 °C in MBSH (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 24 mm NaHCO3, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 0.33 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate). Protease Protection and Pulse-Chase Assays in Oocytes—The oocytes were injected as described above, incubated at 18 °C for 3 h, and homogenized by hand in 3 volumes of 0.25 m sucrose, 50 mm KAc, 5 mm MgAc2, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5. The homogenates were divided into three 10-μl aliquots on ice. Proteinase K (Roche Applied Science) was added (final concentration, 0.2 mg/ml) in the presence or absence of 1% Triton X-100. The reactions were incubated on ice for 1 h and rapidly mixed with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (10 mm) and boiled in 10 volumes of 1% SDS, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 5 min. The samples were then diluted in 10 volumes of buffer A (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA), incubated at 4 °C for 15 min, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble debris. Efficiency of the assay was regularly assessed using a known secretory control protein and was >80%. For pulse-chase assays oocytes were injected as described and incubated at 18 °C for 2 h, and the medium was then replaced with fresh MBSH containing 2 mm methionine. The oocytes were harvested at the specified time points and processed as above. HEK-293 Pulse-Chase Studies—HEK-293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified essential medium (Fisher) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). The cells were grown on plastic in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and were passaged every 3–4 days. The cells were transfected at 50–60% confluence with TransIT-LT transfection reagent (Mirus, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions (3 μg of cDNA and 12 μl of TransIT-LT reagent/60-mm plate). Transfection efficiencies were ∼40% as determined by EGFP fluorescence. 48 h after transfection media was replaced with 1 ml of methionine-cysteine-free medium for 30 min. The cells were then pulse-labeled with 80 μCi of [35S]methionine for 15 min, and the medium was removed and replaced with fresh complete medium for the indicated duration of the chase. The cells were lysed on ice with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% dexoycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 2.5 mm MgCl2,1× protease inhibitors III (CalBiochem, San Diego, CA), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min on ice and passed through a 26-gauge needle three times. The samples were then clarified at 16,000 × g for 12 min. Immunoprecipitation—Clarified oocyte or HEK cell homogenates were incubated with anti-prolactin antisera (ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA) at 1:2000 dilution, polyclonal anti-EGFP antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at 1:2000 dilution, or polyclonal rabbit anti-AQP1 antisera raised against purified AQP1 protein (generously provided by A. Verkman, UCSF, San Francisco, CA) at 1:1000 dilution and 5.0 μl of protein-A Affigel (Bio-Rad). The samples were rotated for 10 h at 4 °C (oocyte homogenates) and 4 h (HEK cells) prior to washing three times with solubilization buffer and twice with 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0. The samples were boiled in protein SDS loading buffer (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, EN3HANCE (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) fluorography. The intensity of recovered bands was quantitated using a Bio-Rad personal Molecular PhosphorImager Fx (Kodak screens, Quantity-1 software). PNGase F Digests—Beads from immunoprecipitations were resuspended after the final wash in 15 μl of 0.1 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 0.3 μl of PNGase F (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. The samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above.

Cell. 1998; 2: 495-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The rationale for this approach is that topology of TM segments and their connecting loops is controlled by the action of topogenic determinants encoded within the nascent polypeptide. TM segments that function as signal (anchor) sequences open the Sec61 translocon channel and initiate translocation of polypeptide into the ER lumen. All else being equal, translocation will continue until a second TM segment is synthesized that functions as a stop transfer sequence to close the translocon, relax the ribosome-translocon junction, and allow the next peptide loop to enter the cytosol. In this manner, topology is determined cotranslationally as the nascent polypeptide emerges from the ribosome. A passive reporter domain (i.e. one containing no intrinsic topogenic information) fused to a peptide loop downstream of a signal sequence will therefore follow the loop into the ER lumen, whereas a reporter located downstream of a stop transfer will, in turn, remain in the cytosol. Two variations on this strategy have been employed to map the cotranslational topology of AQP1. In the first approach, a C-terminal reporter domain derived from the secretory protein prolactin was fused to each AQP1 peptide loop, and topology was determined in vitro and in microinjected Xenopus oocytes using a protease protection assay (22Skach W.R. Shi L.B. Calayag M.C. Frigeri A. Lingappa V.R. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 803-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The second approach used a different chimeric cassette containing an N-terminal EGFP domain and a C-terminal reporter derived from the β-subunit of the H/K-ATPase. Topology of the β-subunit was then determined in HEK-293 cells based on N-linked glycosylation, which occurs exclusively in the ER lumen (26Dohke Y. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15215-15219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 40Hubbard S.C. Ivatt R.J. Annu. Rev.

Key differences between these studies are summarized in Fig. 1. In oocytes, reporters fused to the TM2–3 loop (residue Pro77) or the TM3–4 loop (Leu139) were located in the ER lumen and cytosol, respectively (Fig. 1A) (22Skach W.R. Shi L.B. Calayag M.C. Frigeri A. Lingappa V.R. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 803-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Surprisingly this was different from their expected topology in the mature protein. Two subsequent studies confirmed these results and demonstrated that AQP1 TM segments 2–4 cotranslationally acquire an immature topology that is subsequently converted to the mature topology by an internal 180° rotation of TM3 (23Lu Y. Turnbull I.R. Bragin A. Carveth K. Verkman A.S. Skach W.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2973-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 24Foster W. Helm A. Turnbull I. Gulati H. Yang B. Verkman A.S. Skach W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34157-34165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In contrast, glycosylation patterns of the β-subunit domain lead to the conclusion that the TM2–3 and TM3–4 loops acquire their proper topology cotranslationally in the ER of mammalian cells and therefore do not undergo a topological reorientation (Fig. 1B). Although similar in many ways, these studies differed in several important aspects including the location of fusion sites, the reporter domain used, and the cell expression system. We therefore undertook a systematic comparison of AQP1 biogenesis in oocytes and mammalian cells using similar truncation sites and reporters to resolve these discrepancies. Because the major differences involved the initial orientation of TM3 (Type I in oocytes and Type II in HEK cells), we focused our attention primarily on the topology of TM3 and its immediate flanking residues. Topology of other regions such as the N and C termini and TM5–6 are well established and were therefore not retested here (Fig. 1). Reporter Fusion Site Does Not Affect Outcome of Early Biogenesis Experiments in Oocytes—We first addressed whether topological differences might arise from the use of different fusion sites. In particular, up to 10–15 flanking residues can influence topogenic activities of TM segments (42Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5786-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Thus fusion sites very close to the TM C terminus such as those used in the EGFP-β-subunit chimeras might delete potentially important topogenic information. Alternatively, the fusion site might introduce new flanking residues (from the β-subunit) that could inadvertently alter TM2 behavior. AQP1 fusion sites were therefore tested head-to-head by placing the prolactin reporter at both truncations sites downstream of TM2 (Ser66 and Pro77), TM3 (Thr120 and Leu139),"

Lawrence D.A. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14914-14921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which produce the active serine proteinase plasmin by cleavage of plasminogen. Similar to other serpins, PAI-1 employs the difference in the free energy between the active (“stressed”; Fig. 1) and inactive (“relaxed”) conformations of the molecule to execute a unique suicide mechanism of proteinase inactivation (Scheme 1). The enzyme (E) forms a Michaelis complex (EI) with PAI-1 (I), interacting with the reactive center loop (RCL) exposed to the solution in the active conformation (Fig. 1). However, cleavage of the scissile bond and formation of the acyl-enzyme (E∼I′) triggers “stressed-to-relaxed” transition of PAI-1, resulting in fast insertion of the C-terminal part of RCL as strand 4 of β-sheet A (Fig. 1), translocation of the proteinase from the initial binding site to the opposite pole of the PAI-1 molecule, and its inactivation, due to a mechanical distortion of the enzyme's active site (9Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). An elegant hypothesis, proposing conservation of the free energy for proteinase distortion through reversible displacement of α-helix F, has been recently published (10Gettins P.G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 523: 2-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Since deacylation of proteinase also occurs during the reaction, the PAI-1 mechanism includes inhibitory and substrate branches (Scheme 1), which yield either the final inhibitory complex (E-I*) or a cleaved inactive PAI-1 (I*) together with regenerated enzyme. The efficiency of the inhibitory reaction (Scheme 1) could be expressed quantitatively by the stoichiometry of inhibition (SI = 1 + ks/ki) (11Chaillan-Huntington C.E. Gettins P.G.W. Huntington J.A.

Although the reaction mostly follows the inhibitory pathway (SI∼1), the thermodynamically favorable products (E and I*) finally form (Scheme 1) through slow (kd << ki) hydrolysis of the inhibitory complex (E-I*). Unlike other serpins, PAI-1 possesses an ability for spontaneous inactivation due to a “stressed-to-relaxed” transition via insertion of uncleaved RCL, resulting in the latent conformation of PAI-1 (13Shore J.D.

These observations strongly call for further studies of the mechanism by which Vn, alone and in combination with mAbs, affects the kinetics and stoichiometry of the reaction of PAI-1 with target proteinases. To the best of our knowledge, there are no previously reported data on effects of Vn on the kinetics of insertion of RCL during the reaction of PAI-1 and its mAb complexes with target proteinases (Scheme 1).Fig. 2Effects of Mab-2, Vn, and both ligands on the kinetics of RCL insertion for the reaction of NBD P9 PAI-1 with uPA (A) and tPA (B) in 0.05 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 25 °C.

Values of kobs for the reactions of NBD P9 PAI-1 and its complexes with Mab-2 and Vn were calculated by fitting the time traces of the increase in the NBD fluorescence emission to a single exponential equation, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The values of Km and klim (shown in Table I) as well as the line of best fit (r2 > 0.98) of a hyperbolic equation kobs = klim × [E]/(Km + [E]) to the experimental data were calculated using nonlinear regression employing SigmaPlot 8.0.

Effects on kinetics of RCL insertion and stoichiometry of the reaction of NBD P9 PAI-1 with target proteinases were determined for Vn, in combination with Mab-2, its Fab fragment (Fab-2), and MA-55F4C12, which have overlapping epitopes at or close to the N-terminal part of α-helix F of PAI-1 (Fig. 1). Since protonation of a histidine residue at the PAI-1/tPA interface induces a significant increase in the limiting rate of RCL insertion for NBD P9 PAI-1 and its complex with MA-55F4C12 (28Komissarov A.A. Declerck P.J. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23007-23013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), the effects of Vn were studied at normal physiological pH and at pH 8.0 and 6.2. The results obtained reveal the mechanism of modulation of PAI-1 activity by Vn and demonstrate additivity in the effects of Vn and mAbs directed against α-helix F on the reactions of PAI-1 with tPA and uPA. Proteins and Reagents—Human Vn (2 mg/ml), purified from plasma, was from Promega (Madison, WI). Human recombinant tPA (Activase) was provided by Genentech (South San Francisco, CA). Human recombinant uPA was from Abbott. Analytical grade buffer reagents were from Sigma. The S338C (P9 Cys) PAI-1 mutant variant was purified, labeled with NBD, and characterized as described previously (13Shore J.D. Day D.E. Francis-Chmura A.M. Verhamme I. Kvassman J. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5395-5398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The concentrations of NBD PAI-1, tPA, uPA, and antibodies were determined spectrophotometrically (29Komissarov A.A. Declerck P.J. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43858-43865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To minimize buffer change effects, all experiments were performed in 50 mm phosphate buffer solutions with pH 7.4, 6.2, and 8.0 at 25 °C. A buffer with a certain pH was prepared directly by mixing solutions of 50 mm KH2PO4 with 50 mm K2HPO4. The concentration of buffer was selected to provide capacity (at least 5 mm) to control pH in all of the experiments designed for this study. Stopped-flow Measurements—An SX-18MV stopped-flow reaction analyzer (Applied Photophysics Ltd.), equipped with a fluorescence detector, was used to study the effects of Vn on the rates of reaction between proteinases and complexes of NBD P9 PAI-1 (10-20 nm) with mAbs or Fab-2 (50-200 nm). RCL insertion was monitored by measuring an increase in NBD fluorescence emission through a 500-nm cut-off filter (excitation wavelength at 480 nm). Vn (30-80 nm) was added to preformed NBD P9 PAI-1·mAb complexes at least 20 min prior to data collection. During the progress of the reaction, the time-dependent increase in the fluorescence emission intensity of the NBD group has been recorded as 1000 data points. Data Analysis—Nonlinear least squares fitting of the results has been carried out employing the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm in SigmaPlot 8.0 (SPSS Inc.) for Windows. The stopped-flow NBD fluorescence traces were analyzed using either the BioKine software (Applied Photophysics) or SigmaPlot 8.0 software. Assuming the pseudo-first-order kinetics (concentration of proteinase was at least 5-fold higher than concentration of NBD P9 PAI-1 or its complexes), the stopped flow traces were fit using the single exponential equation: Ft = A + B(1 - e-kobst), where Ft represents fluorescence emission (500-nm cut-off filter) at time t (seconds), A is an offset (the fluorescence signal at t = 0), and B is the amplitude. The values of kobs (average of 5-10 measurements; S.E. <10%) obtained at different concentrations of uPA or tPA were plotted against proteinase concentration using SigmaPlot 8.0, and the corresponding plots were fit by a hyperbolic equation kobs = klim × [E]/(Km + [E]), where klim is the limiting rate constant of RCL insertion, and Km is the proteinase concentration ([E]) at half of saturation. The quality of the fit of NBD fluorescence traces was estimated by visual analysis of plots of the residuals (deviation of the fitted function from the data). Correlation coefficients (r2) calculated from curve fittings were also used as a parameter of goodness of fit (r2 of fit exceeded 0.98 for all stopped-flow data). Measurements of Stoichiometry of Inhibition (SI)—To determine the effect of Vn, mAbs, and both ligands on the distribution between inhibitory and substrate branches of PAI-1 reaction, the SI was determined. Values of SI for NBD P9 PAI-1·mAb complexes, with and without Vn, were measured directly by titration of complexes of NBD P9 PAI-1 with tPA or uPA, as described previously (29Komissarov A.A. Declerck P.J. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43858-43865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Binary complexes of NBD P9 PAI-1 (10-40 nm) with mAbs, Fab-2 (50-200 nm), or Vn (30-80 nm) as well as ternary Vn·NBD P9 PAI-1·mAb (Fab-2) complexes were preformed and equilibrated at room temperature for at least 30 min. A Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (excitation wavelength of 480 nm, emission at 530 nm; slit widths 5 and 10 nm for excitation and emission, respectively) was employed for titration of NBD P9 PAI-1 and NBD P9 PAI-1·mAb, NBD P9 PAI-1·Vn, or Vn·NBD P9 PAI-1·mAb complexes. The titration was performed by monitoring an increase in NBD fluorescence emission (13Shore J.D. Day D.E. Francis-Chmura A.M. Verhamme I. Kvassman J. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5395-5398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), resulting from interaction of NBD P9 PAI-1 or its complex with an aliquot of proteinase. After changes of fluorescence emission had reached the maximum, the next portion of the enzyme was added. At the end point of titration, the increase in fluorescence emission of the NBD group due to RCL insertion approached saturation, since all of the NBD P9 PAI-1 was cleaved. The SI values were calculated as the ratios between the numbers of moles of NBD P9 PAI-1 present and the numbers of moles of proteinase required for complete titration of uncomplexed NBD P9 PAI-1. The SI values were reported as averages of at least two independent experiments. Fab Fragment of Mab-2—The Fab fragment of monoclonal anti-PAI-1 clone 2 antibody (Mab-2) (30Nielsen L.S. Andreasen P.A. Grondahl-Hansen J. Huang J.Y. Kristensen P. Dano K. Thromb. Haemost. 1986; 55: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) was obtained by digesting Mab-2 with 1:100 (w/w) papain for 18 h. After digestion was stopped with E64, Fab fragments were separated from the Fc domains using a Protein A-coupled Sepharose column and affinity-purified on a PAI-1-coupled Sepharose column. The affinity of Fab-2 to NBD P9 PAI-1 and NBD P9 PAI-1·Vn was estimated from the dependence of kobs for the reaction with tPA on Fab-2 concentration, as described earlier for other anti-PAI-1 mAbs (29Komissarov A.A. Declerck P.J. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43858-43865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction between tPA, taken at a concentration (1.5-2.0 μm) at least 2 times higher than the value of Km, and NBD P9 PAI-1 or its preformed complex with Vn were carried out using SX-18MV stopped-flow reaction analyzer. The values of kobs were calculated by fitting the changes in the fluorescence of NBD group by a single exponential process. The values of Kd were estimated from the midpoints of dependence of kobsversus the logarithm of Fab-2 concentration. The effects of Fab-2 on the reactions of NBD P9 PAI-1 with target proteinases as well as effects of Vn on SI and the kinetics of the RCL insertion, due to the reactions of NBD P9 PAI-1·Fab-2 complex with tPA and uPA at pH 6.2 and 8.0, were determined in a manner similar to the whole mAbs. Additivity in Effects of Vn on the Reaction of NBD P9 PAI-1·mAb Complexes with Target Proteinases—The effects of Vn on the kinetics of RCL insertion and stoichiometry of the reaction of NBD P9 PAI-1·mAb complexes with target proteinases was tested through comparison of changes in the free energy of activation for the limiting step of the PAI-1 reaction (ΔΔGRCL‡) and partition activation free energy (ΔΔGpartition‡). The values of ΔΔGRCL‡ were calculated from klim as ΔΔGRCL‡=−RTln(klim/klim0), where klim0 is the limiting rate of RCL insertion for the reaction of NBD P9 PAI-1 with target proteinase in the absence of ligands; klim values are the limiting rates of RCL insertion for NBD P9 PAI-1·mAb or ternary complexes Vn·NBD P9 PAI-1·mAb, T is the standard temperature 298 K, and R = 1.987 cal/mol K is the gas constant. The values of ΔΔGpartition‡(ΔΔGpartition‡=−RTln(ks/ki)=−RTln(SI−1)) were calculated from the SI values for NBD P9 PAI-1·mAb without and with Vn. The data were plotted as ΔΔGpartition‡versusΔΔGRCL‡. A line was fitted to the data, using SigmaPlot version 8.0 software. Effects of Vn and mAbs, Directed against α-helix F, on the Kinetics of RCL Insertion during the Reaction of NBD P9 PAI-1 with tPA and uPA—To determine the effects of Vn on the kinetics of RCL insertion, the dependences of the observed rate constant (kobs) of increase in the NBD-fluorescence emission on the proteinase concentration (Fig. 2) were determined at normal physiologic pH 7.4 (25 °C). The dependences of kobs on proteinase concentration always demonstrated saturation (Fig. 2) for both target proteinases. Therefore, tPA and uPA interact with complexes of NBD P9 PAI-1 with mAb or Vn in a manner similar to that described for uncomplexed NBD P9 PAI-1 (31Olson S.T. Swanson R. Day D. Verhamme I. Kvassman J. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11742-11756Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The values of the limiting rate of RCL insertion (klim) and the concentration of proteinase at half-saturation (Km) for the reactions of NBD P9 PAI-1 and its mAb or Vn complexes with tPA and uPA were calculated (Table I). Vn, on its own, induced an almost 7-fold decrease in klim for the reaction of NBD P9 PAI-1 with uPA, but only a 1.4-fold decrease in klim for the reaction with tPA (Table I). Mab-2 alone induced a 4.5-fold decrease in klim for uPA and a 17-fold decrease in klim for tPA (Table I). The effect of Mab-2 on the reaction of NBD P9 PAI-1 with target proteinases was similar to that observed earlier for MA-55F4C12 (29Komissarov A.A. Declerck P.J. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43858-43865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Both mAbs have epitopes at the N terminus of α-helix F (32Bijnens A.P. Gils A. Knockaert I. Stassen J.M. Declerck P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6375-6380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Binding of Vn did not change dramatically the specificity (klim/Km) for the reaction with uPA; the decrease in klim, observed for the reaction of NBD P9 PAI-1 with uPA in the presence of Vn, was accompanied by similar changes in Km (Table I). In contrast, binding of mAbs induced significant decrease in klim for the reaction with tPA, without changes in Km (Table I), which resulted in a corresponding decrease in klim/Km. The different effects of Vn and mAbs on the kinetics of the reaction of PAI-1 with uPA and tPA could indicate different mechanisms of modulation of the PAI-1 reaction by Vn and mAbs.Table IEffects of Vn on the kinetics of RCL insertion (calculated by fitting a hyperbolic equation (kobs = klim × [E]/(Km + [E])) to plots of kobs versus proteinase concentration (Fig. 2) using SigmaPlot (SPSS, Inc.) version 8.0 for Windows) for the reactions of target proteinases with complexes of NBD P9 PAI-1 with Mab-2 and MA-55F4C12 All measurements were carried out at 25 °C in 0.05 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4Ligand(s)tPAuPAklimKmklimKms-1μms-1μmNone2.4 ± 0.20.06 ± 0.0226.0 ± 1.83.0 ± 0.6Vn1.7 ± 0.10.09 ± 0.023.9 ± 0.10.55 ± 0.04Mab-20.14 ± 0.040.05 ± 0.025.8 ± 0.40.65 ± 0.15MA-55F4C120.18 ± 0.060.04 ± 0.016.1 ± 0.40.76 ± 0.17Mab-2 + Vn0.08 ± 0.010.04 ± 0.010.49 ± 0.030.13 ± 0.02MA-55F4C12 + Vn0.09 ± 0.030.05 ± 0.020.65 ± 0.150.10 ± 0.03 Open table in a new tab Vn affected the kinetics of RCL insertion for the reactions of NBD P9 PAI-1·mAb complexes with tPA and uPA in a manner similar to the reactions of the uncomplexed serpin (Table I). In the presence of Vn, klim for the reaction of complexes of NBD P9 PAI-1 with Mab-2 or MA-55F4C12 with uPA decreased by almost an order of magnitude (Table I). Similar to the effects on uncomplexed NBD P9 PAI-1, a decrease in klim for the reaction with uPA due to binding of Vn to NBD P9 PAI-1·mAb was accompanied by a 5.0- and 7.5-fold decrease in Km for Mab-2 and MA-55F4C12, respectively (Table I). In contrast to the reaction with uPA, Vn caused a 1.8-2.0-fold decrease in klim for the reaction of complexes with tPA with a corresponding decrease in the specificity of the reaction (Table I). The similarity in the effects of Vn on the reactions of free NBD P9 PAI-1 and its complexes with mAbs could indicate additivity in the effects of the two ligands on kinetics of RCL insertion during reaction with target proteinases. Effects of Vn and mAbs on SI for the Reactions of NBD P9 PAI-1 with Target Proteinases—To determine the effect of Vn on partitioning between inhibitory and substrate branches (Scheme 1) of the PAI-1·mAb mechanism, the stoichiometry of inhibition (SI) for the reactions of tPA and uPA with NBD P9 PAI-1·mAb complexes was measured with and without Vn (Fig. 3). Vn did not affect the SI for the reactions of NBD P9 PAI-1 with target proteinases, which agrees wit"
https://openalex.org/W2013964934,"We have determined the crystal structure, at 1.2-Å resolution, of Equisetum arvense ferredoxin isoform II (FdII), which lacks residues equivalent to Arg39 and Glu28 highly conserved among other ferredoxins (Fds). In other Fds these residues form an intramolecular salt bridge crucial for stabilization of the [2Fe-2S] cluster, which is disrupted upon complex formation with Fd-NADP+ oxidoreductase (FNR) to form two intermolecular salt bridges. The overall structure of FdII resembles the known backbone structures of E. arvense isoform I (FdI) and other plant-type Fds. Dramatically, in the FdII structure a unique, alternative salt bridge is formed between Arg22 and Glu58. This results in a different relative orientation of the α-helix formed by Leu23-Glu29 and eliminates the possibility of forming three of the five intermolecular salt bridges identified on formation of a complex between maize FdI and maize FNR. Mutation of FdII, informed by structural differences with FdI, showed that the alternative salt bridge and the absence of an otherwise conserved Tyr residue are important for the alternative stabilization of the FdII [2Fe-2S] cluster. We also investigated FdI and FdII electron transfer to FNR on chloroplast thylakoid membranes. The Km and Vmax values of FdII are similar to those of FdI, contrary to previous measurements of the reverse reaction, from FNR to Fd. The affinity between reduced FdI and oxidized FNR is much greater than that between oxidized FdI and reduced FNR, whereas this is not the case with FdII. The pH dependence of electron transfer by FdI, FdII, and an FdII mutant with FdI features was measured and further indicated that the binding mode to FNR differs between FdI and FdII. Based on this evidence, we hypothesize that binding modes with other Fd-dependent reductases may also vary between FdI and FdII. The structural differences between FdI and FdII therefore result in functional differences that may influence partitioning of electrons into different redox metabolic pathways.

[2Fe-2S] ferredoxin (Fd) 1The abbreviations used are: Fd, ferredoxin; FNR, ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase; FTR, ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase; NiR, nitrite reductase; SiR, sulfite reductase. electron transfer proteins distribute reducing equivalents derived from light energy to Fd-dependent reductases, such as Fd-NADP+ reductase (FNR), nitrite reductase (NiR), sulfite reductase (SiR), and Fd-thioredoxin reductase (FTR), for the assimilation of inorganic compounds and the regulation of carbon assimilation (1Knaff D.B. Ort D.R. Yocum C.F. Photosynthesis: The Light Reactions. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, Netherlands1996: 333-361Google Scholar, 2Blankenship R.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 94-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Recently, Fds have also been found to donate electrons to desaturases for biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids (3Schultz D.J. Suh M.C. Ohlrogge J.B. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), choline monooxygenase for betaine biosynthesis (4Rathinasabapathi B. Burnet M. Russell B.L. Gage D.A. Liao P-C. Nye G.N. Scott P. Golbeck J.H. Hanson A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Plant Physiol. 1995; 130: 1958-1966Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar), indicative of the contribution of Fds to various metabolic pathways in addition to assimilation of inorganic substances. Most intriguingly, higher plant species possess several isoforms of Fd, implying isoform specificity to different redox-metabolic pathways. For example, maize Fd isoforms, FdI and FdII, are distributed differentially in mesophyll and bundle-sheath cells and are found to be mainly involved in the formation of NADPH and ATP, respectively (6Kimata Y. Hase T. Plant Physiol. 1989; 89: 1193-1197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The functional difference between maize FdI and FdII is dependent solely on the replacement of Asp65 with Asn, which affects the FNR-binding site (7Matsumura T. Kimata-Ariga Y. Sakakibara H. Sugiyama T. Murata H. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Hase T. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This variation results in distinct phenotypes of cyanobacteria (lacking an endogenous Fd gene) in which FdI and FdII are expressed (8Kimata-Ariga Y. Matsumura T. Kada S. Fujimoto H. Fujita Y. Endo T. Mano J. Sato F. Hase T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5041-5050Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Additionally, biochemical experiments indicate partial differences between the Fd-binding sites of the Fd-dependent reductases FNR, SiR, and FTR (9De Pascalis A.R. Schürmann P. Bosshard H.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 10Akashi T. Matsumura T. Ideguchi T. Iwakiri K. Kawakatsu T. Taniguchi I. Hase T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29399-29405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We therefore suspect that Fd isoforms might play an important role in the modulation of various redox-metabolic pathways in plant cells and that such modulation might be ascribed to specific noncovalent interactions between Fd isoforms and Fd-dependent partner proteins. Recently, we determined the three-dimensional structure of the maize mesophyll Fd (FdI)·FNR complex at 2.59-Å resolution (11Kurisu G. Kusunoki M. Katoh E. Yamazaki T. Teshima K. Onda Y. Kimata-Ariga Y. Hase T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), in which five intermolecular salt bridges are formed between Fd and FNR. This structure shows an intramolecular Fd salt bridge between Arg40-Glu29 is dynamically exchanged to form two intermolecular salt bridges with FNR residues in the process of the complex formation, suggesting the Arg-Glu pair has a role in electron transfer. Furthermore, this Arg-Glu pair is conserved among all but three of more than 70 plant-type Fd sequences (12Matsubara H. Saeki K. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1992; 38: 223-280Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In Equisetum arvense the Arg-Glu pair is conserved in Fd isoform I (FdI) but missing from isoform II (FdII), and a comparison of electron transfer with FNR under excess NADPH shows obvious differences between the Km and kcat values of FdI and FdII. Electron transfer rates of FdII mutants, in which the Arg-Glu pair is introduced, indicate that these residues are crucial to these differences (13Teshima K. Fujita S. Hirose S. Nishiyama D. Kurisu G. Kusunoki M. Kimata-Ariga Y. Hase T. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that E. arvense FdII might vary from FdI in its electron transfer activity around photosystem I, because of its different interaction with FNR. When the Arg-Glu pair of E. arvense FdI is substituted with the corresponding noncharged residues of FdII (R39Q/E28S), the [2Fe-2S] cluster became unstable (13Teshima K. Fujita S. Hirose S. Nishiyama D. Kurisu G. Kusunoki M. Kimata-Ariga Y. Hase T. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), indicating a crucial role for these residues in stabilizing Fd in the native state. However, it should be noted that the [2Fe-2S] cluster of wild type FdII is stable even in the absence of a salt bridge between Arg39 and Glu28. To understand the structural basis of the unique properties of E. arvense FdII and to elucidate the mechanism that stabilizes the [2Fe-2S] cluster, we have therefore determined its crystal structure at 1.2 Å resolution and compared this with the previously determined structure of E. arvense FdI (1.8 Å resolution) (14Ikemizu S. Bando M. Sato T. Morimoto Y. Tsukihara T. Fukuyama K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We report that FdII has another different internal salt bridge between Arg22-Glu58 instead of that between Arg39-Glu28 and that the [2Fe-2S] cluster is stabilized by this alternative salt bridge, and by the deletion of one amino acid residue in a short loop connecting the cluster binding loop to the preceding α-helix region. Furthermore, we investigated the electron transfer capabilities of E. arvense FdI and FdII from photosystem I to FNR by using chloroplast thylakoid membranes. We will discuss a correlation between the structural differences of FdI and FdII and their electron transfer abilities with FNR. Preparation of Recombinant Fds—E. arvense recombinant FdII, FdI, and the FdII mutants were expressed and accumulated as the apo-form in Escherichia coli cells and successfully converted to the holo-form by chemical reconstitution of the [2Fe-2S] cluster as described previously (13Teshima K. Fujita S. Hirose S. Nishiyama D. Kurisu G. Kusunoki M. Kimata-Ariga Y. Hase T. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Further purification of the Fds was carried out as described previously (15Hase T. Mizutani S. Mukohata Y. Plant Physiol. 1991; 97: 1395-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 16Matsumura T. Sakakibara H. Nakano R. Kimata Y. Sugiyama T. Hase T. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Site-specific and insertion mutants of FdII R22T, FdII with Tyr32 newly inserted (FdII(Y32)) and FdII(Y32)Q38R/S28E were prepared with the Quikchange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) (13Teshima K. Fujita S. Hirose S. Nishiyama D. Kurisu G. Kusunoki M. Kimata-Ariga Y. Hase T. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and these mutation sites were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The concentration of Fd was determined spectrophotometrically based on a molar extinction coefficient of 9.68 mm-1 cm-1 at 422 nm (17Tagawa K. Arnon D.I. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1968; 153: 602-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Crystallization—We searched extensively for crystallization conditions of E. arvense FdII by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method with Crystal Screen I and II (Hampton Research) and Wizard I, II, and cryo (Emerald Biostructures). Sodium phosphate and ammonium sulfate were also checked as precipitants. Needle-shape crystals of FdII were initially obtained at 4 °C from equal volumes of the protein (10 mg/ml) and reservoir solution (3.1 m NaH2PO4/K2HPO4 (pH 7.5)), but were too small for x-ray experiments. Flat plate-shaped crystals of appropriate size were successfully obtained with the same reservoir solution additionally containing benzamidine hydrochloride (2.0% (w/v)). The improved crystals were transferred to a reservoir solution containing sucrose (20% (w/v)) and immediately frozen with liquid nitrogen for x-ray experiments. Crystallographic Data Collection and Processing—X-ray data were collected at a wavelength of 0.9 Å at beamline BL44XU at the SPring-8 synchrotron in Hyogo, Japan. Diffraction images were collected at liquid nitrogen temperature (100 K) on a CCD-based PX210 detector system. Images were processed with the program DPS/MOSFLM (18Rossman M.G. Beeek C.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Bando M. Sato T. Morimoto Y. Tsukihara T. Fukuyama K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) as a search model with the program CNS (20Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16991) Google Scholar). First, the structure of FdII was refined with isotropic temperature factors using the program CNS. After convergence with CNS, we next used the program SHELXL in the SHELX97 program package to model atomic anisotropy. Manual revision of the atomic model was carried out with the program O (21Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13016) Google Scholar). On careful inspection of the |Fo| - |Fc| and 2|Fo| - |Fc| maps, we added benzamidine and water molecules into the model and modeled dual conformers of amino acid side chains. Subsequent refinement was carried out up to 1.2 Å resolution without any structural restraints on the [2Fe-2S] cluster. The stereochemical geometry of the model was checked with the program PROCHECK (22Vaguine A.A. Richelle J. Wodak S.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 191-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Stability Assays—The degradation rates of the [2Fe-2S] clusters of FdII and FdII mutants were measured by monitoring the decrease of A420 due to the presence of the [2Fe-2S] cluster for 36 h at pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 4 °C. The initial values of A420 were set at 0.5-1.2 for all the samples. The stabilities of their [2Fe-2S] clusters were evaluated by their half-lives estimated on the assumption that degradation of the [2Fe-2S] cluster obeys first-order kinetics. Enzyme Assays—NADP+ photoreduction ability of Fd by purified thylakoid membranes from spinach chloroplast was assayed as described previously (23Hanke G.T. Kimata-Ariga Y. Taniguchi I. Hase T. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained, in a total volume of 1.0 ml, 0.2 mm NADP+, thylakoid membranes (about 0.01 μg of chlorophyll), 1-10 μm Fd, 50 mm Hepes (pH 6.4-8.1) and 100 mm NaCl. The reaction was measured in a spectrometer and was initiated by irradiating with red light perpendicular to the spectrophotometric light beam. The increase of A340 due to the photoreduction of NADP+ was monitored. The pH dependences of the abilities of FdI, FdII, and FdII mutant between pH 6.4 and 7.7 were analyzed using the equation, v = V0 + ΣΔVi × Ka,i/((H+) + Ka,i), where V0 is the ability when all the ionizable groups participating are protonated, and Ka,i is the dissociation constant of the corresponding ionizable group participating, and ΔVi is the change in the ability when the ionizable group with a pKa value of pKa,i is deprotonated. The analysis was not corrected with the effect of a change of the net charge, because only a few ionizable groups are dissociated in the neutral pH region. Quality of E. arvense FdII Structure—Crystals of FdII belong to space group C2, with unit cell parameters a = 97.54 Å, b = 29.41 Å, c = 32.56 Å, and β = 103.94° (Table I). The refined model of FdII contains 1 FdII molecule, 6 benzamidines, and 208 water molecules in the asymmetric unit. A total of nine residues in the final model have dual conforming side chains. The final crystallographic R factor and free R factor with anisotropic temperature factors are 11.75 and 15.45%, respectively, for 27,366 unique reflections in the resolution range of 16-1.2 Å. All amino acid residues of FdII except glycine and proline residues are in the stereochemically most favored regions in the Ramachandran plot. Refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. Overall Structure—The overall structures of E. arvense FdII and FdI (14Ikemizu S. Bando M. Sato T. Morimoto Y. Tsukihara T. Fukuyama K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) are shown as ribbon drawings in Fig. 1, A and B, respectively. A superimposition of the main chain structures of FdII and FdI is shown in Fig. 1C. The structures are superimposed along the C-α atoms of residues 1-93 and the [2Fe-2S] cluster in FdII, and C-α atoms of residues 1-31 and 33-94 and the [2Fe-2S] cluster in FdI, because FdII lacks the 32nd and the C-terminal 95th residues in comparison to FdI, as shown in the sequence alignment (Fig. 2). The root mean square deviation value for the C-α atom between the two structures is 1.17 Å. The overall structure of FdII was fairly similar to that of FdI and also resembled the other known backbone structures of plant-type Fds (25Binda C. Coda A. Aliverti A. Zanetti G. Mattevi A.

These differences may be ascribed to the deletion of Tyr32 in FdII (Fig. 2). In the region of FdII corresponding to the salt bridge formed between Arg39 and Glu28 in FdI (Fig. 1B), the corresponding Gln38 and Ser28 side chains do not even form a hydrogen bond. Instead, Arg22 and Glu58 form a unique, alternative salt bridge in FdII (Fig. 1A), which has no counterpart in the corresponding Thr22 and Glu59 of FdI. On refinement of this region, we found that both Arg22 and Glu58 have two rotational conformations. In the major side chain conformation, the major electron densities were interpreted as forming a salt bridge, whereas the minor conformations were exposed to the bulk solvent region containing 1.6 m phosphate as a precipitant. Therefore, we consider that these rotational conformations corresponding to minor electron densities were generated because of the very high ionic strength of the surrounding environment and that under the usual physiological conditions the Arg22 and Glu58 form an intramolecular salt bridge.

The general arrangement of the [2Fe-2S] cluster and its surroundings show high structural homology between the FdI and FdII. Apart from Leu35, Gln38, and Thr44; the local side chain conformation of the cluster binding loop in FdII is almost identical to that of the corresponding side chains in FdI. The hydrogen bonding networks around the [2Fe-2S] clusters of FdII and FdI are shown in Fig. 3. In FdII the O-γ atom of Thr44 is hydrogen-bonded to the S-γ atom of Cys42, and an equivalent bond also occurs in FdI between the O-γ atom of Ser45 and the S-γ atom of Cys43. By contrast, FdII has no counterpart to the hydrogen bond between the O-γ atom of Ser37 and the S-γ atom of Cys43 in FdI, because both dual conformations of the side chain of Ser36 for FdII face the bulk solvent region. Therefore, the number of hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl group of Ser (or Thr) or the backbone amide group and the S atom of the [2Fe-2S] cluster or the sulfhydryl group of the Cys coordinating the cluster is 1 less for FdII than for FdI. In general, it is known that hydrogen bonds between backbone amide groups and cluster S atoms or coordinating sulfhydryl groups decrease the redox potential (32Sheridan R.P. Allen L.C.

We also determined the redox potentials of these Fds by cyclic voltammetry demonstrating that the potential (-403.8 ± 0.4 mV) of FdII is slightly lower than that (-396.6 ± 1.3 mV) of FdI. As exposure of the cluster to the bulk solvent and the dielectric constant around the [2Fe-2S] cluster are also crucial factors in determining the redox potential, we are currently refining E. arvense FdI structure at higher resolution (∼1.2 Å higher than the known 1.8 Å) to compare more precisely the microenvironment around the [2Fe-2S] cluster at atomic resolution between FdII and FdI.

The plastid translocon must therefore be responsive to the changing cell environment to deliver efficiently different arrays of structurally diverse proteins. Although the Tic40-related envelope proteins appear to be translocon components designed to address the varying needs of protein translocation, details of their involvement remain elusive. This study was thus designed to combine plant-based experiments and yeast mitochondrion-based approaches for unveiling clues related to how the Tic40 components may behave during the protein translocation process. The main findings related to how Tic40 proteins may work are: 1) natural fluctuations are apparent in developing tissues, in different organs of the same plant, and in different species; 2) transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings can tolerate functionally a wide range of variations in Tic40 levels, from partial suppression to excessive production; 3) the Tic40 proteins themselves exhibit configurational changes in their association with yeast mitochondria in response to different carbon sources; 4) the presence of Tic40 proteins in yeast mitochondria influences regulatory aspects of the mitochondrial translocon; and 5) the Tic40 proteins associate with mitochondrial translocon components involved in regulatory-like events.

The combined data provide evidence that Tic40 proteins possess modulating capabilities. Plastids are diverse in structure and function and occupy key roles in a variety of biosynthetic activities that take place in the ever changing environment of a plant cell. The role of plastids requires frequent adjustments to accommodate varying cellular needs such as those occurring in different organs, during development, during adaptation to external stimuli, or even a combination of needs. The adjustments required can be relatively subtle or distinct. The ability of the plastid to address such needs is dependent on its compositional status, e.g. chloroplasts versus leucoplasts. Although it is well established that changes to plastidial structure and function are governed predominantly by mechanisms that control gene expression (nuclear and organellar), there is growing evidence that the protein transport process contributes additionally to certain facets of these regulatory mechanisms. The involvement of protein transport in the various mechanisms of plastidial change is not unfounded because most of the plastid proteins involved are made as larger precursors before incorporation into organelles. The protein transport machinery of the plastid envelope (the plastid translocon) must therefore be accommodative in its ability to handle in an efficient manner a diverse, ever changing array of proteins. The proteins being handled range from different proteins to structural variations of the same protein. The plastid translocon is also afforded a position where additional “modulating” mechanisms can be introduced and exercised. The translocation of proteins across the envelope is a multistep process involving factors and signals that mediate recognition, specificity, and movement (1Cline K. Henry R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. Devel. 1996; 12: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). There are thus many opportunities for the different translocon components to exercise their modulating capabilities (2Schnell D.J. Herbert D.N. Cell. 2003; 112: 491-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 3Soll J. Curr. Opin.

Although there are potential scenarios in which modulation can be detected, these activities remain the most difficult aspect of the plastid protein transport process to study. One of the least understood aspects is how a seemingly “general” translocon attends to an array of structurally diverse precursor proteins during the various developmental and adaptive phases of a plant cell. Studies to date have provided insight into a number of potential “mechanistic provisions” for handling certain aspects of plastid protein transport. The mechanisms unveiled thus far appear to center predominantly on the GTPase-based receptors Toc159 (plus homologs Toc132/120/90) 1The abbreviations used are: Toc, translocon component of the plastid outer envelope; Tic, translocon component of the plastid inner envelope; Tim, translocon component of the mitochondrial inner membrane; Tom, translocon component of the mitochondrial outer membrane. and Toc33/34 (two variants) and their preferences for different precursor types (6Smith M.D. Rounds C.M.

The removal of Toc159 (via mutagenization) selectively affects the accumulation of photosynthetic rather than nonphotosynthetic proteins (10Bauer J. Chen K. Hiltbunner A. Wehrli E. Eugster M. Schnell D. Kessler F. Nature. 2000; 403: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) because of Toc159 recognition of specific transit peptides (6Smith M.D. Rounds C.M. Wang F. Chen K. Afitlhile M. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Like Toc159, Toc33 appears to be more involved in the transport of photosynthetic proteins than Toc34 (8Becker T. Jelic M. Vojta A. Radunz A. Soll J. Schleiff E.

These receptors also exhibit profiles that change with tissue type and developmental stage, suggesting that mechanisms exist for the “regulation” or “modulation” of the plastid translocon at the site of the GTPase-based receptors to accommodate the transport needs of the tissue or cell. Indications of such mechanisms in action were observed, e.g. during the preferential in vitro import of proteins into chloroplasts versus leucoplasts (19Wan J. Blakeley S.D. Dennis D.T. Ko K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31227-31233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), for “younger” versus “older” plastids (20Dahlin C. Cline K. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 1131-1140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or plastids of nitrogen-fixing versus nonfixing nodules (21Melo P.M. Lima L.M. Santos I.M. Carvalho H.G. Cullimore J.V. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 390-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Toc75-encoding mRNA levels, the outer envelope channel protein, also change in a tissue-specific manner (leaf versus roots) (16Sun C.W. Chen L.J. Lin L.C. Li H.M. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 2053-2061PubMed Google Scholar). Toc75 mRNA reductions parallel the observed changes in Toc75 protein levels between leaves and roots (22Tranel P.J. Froehlich J. Goyal A. Keegstra K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2436-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The number of mechanisms so far uncovered is clearly not sufficient to fulfill all possible dynamic activities operating during the plastid protein transport process. Because other modulating mechanisms are likely to be in play, there is a need to uncover clues as to how other translocon components attend to structurally diverse proteins, especially during other stages of the process. It was stated prominently in two recent reviews (2Schnell D.J. Herbert D.N. Cell. 2003; 112: 491-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 23Weidemann N. Frazier A.E. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14473-14476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) that regulatory mechanisms associated with translocon function represent a new, exciting investigative direction. The 44-kDa envelope proteins (multiple forms or variants termed collectively as Tic40-related translocon components) appear to be one particular candidate that warrants such an analysis. The Tic40 components seem to be designed to meet the various protein translocation needs in a manner different from the receptor-based mechanisms or during other stages of the process. Tic40 proteins are often observed to be heterogeneous with respect to abundance, gel mobility, and different apparent configurations in the envelope (24Wu C. Seibert F.S. Ko K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32264-32271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Ko K. Budd D. Wu C. Siebert F. Kourtz L. Ko Z.W. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2616-2625Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The overall endogenous levels often display fluctuations that seem to parallel the import activity of the tissue or developmental stage (25Ko K. Budd D. Wu C. Siebert F. Kourtz L. Ko Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28601-28608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Tic40 components can also be found in close association with translocating proteins early in the process at the outer envelope, as well as at more advanced stages at the inner envelope (24Wu C. Seibert F.S. Ko K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32264-32271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two select forms of the Tic40-related components (Toc36 and Tic40) exhibit preferential interactions with different precursor (or structural) forms of the thylakoid lumen protein Oee1 (28Ko K. Banerjee S. Innes J. Taylor D. Ko Z. Funct. Plant Biol. 2004; 31: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Partial suppression of Tic40 in transgenic Arabidopsis appears to correlate with lower steady-state Oee1 levels (28Ko K. Banerjee S. Innes J. Taylor D. Ko Z. Funct. Plant Biol. 2004; 31: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The same components were recently defined as co-chaperones by Chou and co-workers (29Chou M.L. Fitzpatrick L.M. Tu S.H. Budziszewski G. Potter-Lewis S. Akita M. Levin J.Z. Keegstra K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2970-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and were shown to affect the overall efficiency of protein import when mutated in Arabidopsis (null mutations of Tic40). Despite these observations, the aspect of the protein translocation process in which Tic40-related translocon components work remains largely unknown. There is clearly a need to advance our understanding of Tic40 function and how Tic40 associates functionally with the rest of the translocon. Therefore, we need to develop parallel strategies aimed at fundamental aspects to track how Tic40 conducts its role. This study thus combines approaches for unveiling clues related to where Tic40 proteins work during the protein translocation process, e.g. in regulation or as structural requirements. The first approach was to profile trends of how Tic40-related components behave in plant tissues, using several semiquantitative assessment models where there is a reasonable expectation of change in the demand on the protein transport process. The natural way in which the Tic40 proteins continuously change, in terms of abundance and forms, provides basic clues on function. We then developed a “cross-organelle” strategy using the analogous system, the yeast mitochondrion, to map out where Tic40 components are likely to associate and exert their role. Because the yeast mitochondrial system is well established relative to the plastid translocon, we utilized known functional aspects of the mitochondrial translocon to search for clues related to the role of Tic40 proteins by determining how the mitochondrial translocon is affected by the presence of Tic40. The combined data provide evidence for the aspect of the protein transport process in which Tic40 components work and that these polypeptides possess modulating capabilities related to their role(s) in protein transport. Procedures for Plant-based Experiments—The plants used were propagated in growth chambers set at 21 °C with a 16:8 h light:dark photoperiod (fluorescent-incandescent lighting). Total cellular protein extracts were prepared for the various indicated tissues by grinding fresh samples in chilled buffer as described previously (30Plaxton W.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Standard DNA cloning techniques were employed in the construction of the transgene-containing binary plasmids (pEND4K-based) (31Klee H. Yanofsky M.F. Nester E.W.

Composition of the transgenes used in this study is as follows: 35S-labeled CaMV promoter, bnToc36B or rcTic40 (both without any internal manipulations), nopaline synthase termination signal. Tic40 proteins were expressed using cDNAs derived from Brassica napus cv. Topas (bnToc36B, a version of Toc36 (24Wu C. Seibert F.S. Ko K. J. Biol.

Plastids were prepared from seedlings grown on media plates as described (32Fitzpatrick L. Keegstra K. Plant J. 2001; 27: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 33Aronson H. Jarvis P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Chlorophyll determinations were performed as described previously (34Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kriedemann P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4736) Google Scholar). Standard immunoblotting techniques were used to assess all protein extracts, which were quantitated and normalized before assessment. Immunoreactive bands were scanned and quantitated relative to appropriate internal references. Construction of Yeast Expression Plasmids—All Tic40-related constructs were inserted into the yeast Escherichia coli shuttle vector YEplac195 (35Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2527) Google Scholar). Expression was achieved using the alcohol dehydrogenase promoter. The rcTic40 cDNA fragment was used without any internal manipulations. A form equivalent to BnToc36B (a version of Toc36) was generated from rcTic40 (designated RcToc36 or rcToc36) using a unique 5′-BstEII site in the rcTic40 cDNA (28Ko K. Banerjee S. Innes J. Taylor D. Ko Z. Funct. Plant Biol. 2004; 31: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Histidine tags were added to the carboxyl termini of both RcTic40 and RcToc36 using a 3′-BstNI site. The fusions occurred at the 3rd residue from the carboxyl end. This deletion had no observable impact on the transport or functionality of the Tic40 proteins (28Ko K. Banerjee S. Innes J. Taylor D. Ko Z. Funct. Plant Biol. 2004; 31: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Plasmids were introduced into the yeast strain INVSc1 (Invitrogen) using standard transformation techniques. Analysis of Yeast Mitochondria—The isolation and subfractionation of mitochondria were conducted as described previously (36Daum G. Bohni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of mitochondria with the proteases thermolysin and trypsin was carried out according to Refs. 37Yamaguchi M.

Pull-down assays were conducted according to Ref. 39Geissler A. Chacinska A. Truscott K.N. Wiedemann N. Brandner K. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Meisinger C. Pfanner N. Rehling P. Cell. 2002; 111: 507-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). All protein samples were quantitated and normalized before assessment. Associating proteins were detected immunologically. The anti-Tic40 IgGs used were equally immunoreactive for all Tic40 forms, independent of derivation source (yeast or plant species) (25Ko K. Budd D. Wu C. Siebert F. Kourtz L. Ko Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28601-28608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Tic40 Components Exhibit Continuous Fluctuation in Tissues Undergoing Plastid Biogenesis and/or Conversion and between Different Plant Varieties—The manner in which a plastid translocon component behaves in tissues undergoing plastid biogenesis and/or conversion is likely to provide valuable information on how the component conducts its role in the protein transport process. We therefore utilized a number of plant-based assessment models to develop semiquantitative profiles for Tic40-related components in tissues where there is a reasonable expectation of change in the demand on the process of plastid protein transport. The tissues selected represent developmental programs involving plastid biogenesis or conversion. Profiles were compiled for whole dark grown seedlings exposed to light for a 24-h period (“greening” model for developing plastids and conversion), developing seeds (whole seed model for developing plastids and conversion), and different plant organs (model for plastid conversion) (Fig. 1, A–C). Tissues were sampled hourly for the greening model (closed yellow to fully expanded, green seedlings), in 2–3-day stages for developing seeds (postpollination to maturity) and from different organs of the same mature plant. The “whole tissue” samples represent collections of different cell types rather than a specific cell type. The resulting protein samples thus reflect all Tic40-related activities present in the tissues sampled and are likely to possess a compilation of different programs related to the role of Tic40. The tissue collection schemes for the “greening seedlings” and the “developing seeds” were designed to assess natural Tic40 fluctuations in a “continuous” fashion. Continuous sampling was a critical experimental feature to observe clearly meaningful fluctuations that bear functional significance in terms of the protein transport process. All profiles were designed for semiquantitative analysis only. The experiments were carried out multiple times, and representative profiles are shown in Fig. 1A. For the purpose of comparison, all samples were also assessed using anti-Tic110 IgGs, an inner envelope translocon component. Tic110 was selected as a semiquantitative reference point because it appears to be the most steady of all components, i.e. nonfluctuating. Tic110 was also used as a semiquantitative internal loading control. We were also interested to see whether different plant species with different types of morphology, especially seed size, were correlated with the activities of the Tic40 components (Fig. 1A plus additional results in Fig. 1B).Fig. 1Tic40 translocon components exhibit natural fluctuations in tissues undergoing plastid biogenesis or conversion.A, semiquantitative immunoblot analysis of Tic40-related translocon components in tissues undergoing plastid biogenesis and/or conversion. The assessment models used are greening seedlings (left panels) and developing seeds (right panels). Profiles for pea and Brassica are presented. Whole seedlings or developing seeds were used to prepare total cell protein extracts. The experiments were designed to measure changes in a continuous fashion, hourly for greening seedlings (after germination in the dark) and in 2–3-day increments for developing seeds (indicated accordingly). A mature leaf sample was included in the Brassica greening seedlings experiment (lane marked ML). Tic110 was analyzed for the same samples and is presented as a semiquantitative reference point. The arrows indicate the positions of smaller Tic40-related proteins (bands migrating around 30 kDa as opposed to the 40 kDa range) that appear during certain stages. B, semiquantitative immunoblot analysis of Tic40 from other species. Profiles for A. thaliana, R. communis, P. vulgaris, and G. max are presented. Tic110 was used as a semiquantitative reference point. C, semiquantitative immunoblot analysis of Tic40 proteins in total cell extracts prepared from different organs of the same individual plant. Profiles for tissues collected from pea and Brassica are presented (YL, young leaf; ML, mature leaf; FL, flower; RT, root; SD, seed; YS, young seed; MS, mature seed). Tic110 was again used as a semiquantitative reference point.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The overall trends observed in each of the assessment models clearly indicate that Tic40 components display fluctuation-related activities (relative to Tic110). The Tic40 proteins in the various tissues or stages of development not only fluctuate in total amounts but also as different band patterns. The patterns of fluctuation were not strictly progressive from an early point to the last stage sampled, i.e. the changes were not in a strict incremental manner from one stage to the next. Other forms of fluctuation within the stages examined were observed, and these may represent other programs taking place in the different cell types within the whole seedlings or whole seeds being assessed. This phenomenon was clearly not the result of errors in the preparation and handling of protein samples because it was observed in all replicates and for different plant species (Pisum sativa, B. napus, A. thaliana, R. communis, Phaseolus vulgaris, Glycine max, as well as other bean varieties (the latter data are not shown)). The trends appear to be part of the collective developmental program of the tissue rather than a product of protein degradation events (occurring either in intact cells or during extraction). Furthermore, Tic110 levels, unlike the Tic40 components, remain relatively stable throughout the same sampling period (in the greening seedling and developing seed experiments). The presence of other forms of fluctuation provides another indication that Tic40 components fluctuate in a natural setting and between different cell types. Fluctuations between different cell types were also evident in the different organs assessed. Samples prepared from different organs of the same mature plant exhibit a fair amount of fluctuation (Fig. 1C). Even more striking is the degree of variation observed in the endogenous levels of Tic40 proteins between different species (Fig. 1, A and B). The fluctuation-related activities exhibited by Tic40 components are likely reflective of the way in which these proteins work. There appears to be a high degree of flexibility in the way the Tic40 proteins operate, such as that observed between different developmental stages and especially between different species. Tic40 functionality thus appears to be linked to aspects involving changes in stoichiometry and the level of different configurations present. These characteristics together point to the possibility that the Tic40 role(s) involves some form of modulating activity. Arabidopsis Seedlings Can Tolerate Manipulations in the Level of Tic40 —Relative to the core plastid translocon components, Tic40-related components clearly exhibit a fair degree of natural fluctuation between tissues of different organs and developmental stages (nontransgenic plants). The trends of fluctuation observed appear to reflect in a logical manner the level and/or mode of importation-based activities that is likely to exist in the different organs (during plastid conversion) or developmental phases (developing plastids). Moreover, the degree of variation observed for Tic40 proteins in different species (nontransgenic) does not appear to influence the plant or its tissues in a manner that can be readily detected or defined as a positive or negative impact. This particular fluctuation phenomenon indicates that there is considerable flexibility in the system, allowing different levels of Tic40 components to work. Because the fluctuations appear to be related to some aspect of function with respect to the protein transport process, we further examined the effects of manipulating “artificially” the level of Tic40 components within a plant species, in our case, Arabidopsis seedlings (Fig. 2). Whole transgenic seedlings (excluding roots) were used for the preparation of plastid samples. The samples thus represent a collection of plastids from different tissues of the harvested seedlings. The analysis was repeated three times, and representative profiles are shown (Fig. 2). All profiles were designed for semiquantitative analysis only. The overall data indicate that the seedlings (green tissues) can tolerate a high degree of fluctuation generated by the transgenes. Partial suppression of steady-state Tic40-related proteins correlated with a general decrease in steady-state levels of the three internal plastid proteins assessed (Fig. 2, see transgenic lines designated L1–L3 (partial suppression)). All steady-state protein levels were measured relative to Tic110 and compared with the wild type. Steady-state levels were typically 20% lower (or more) for the thylakoid lumen protein Oee1 and ∼5–10% for Rbcs and Lhcb1*1, proteins destined for the stroma and thylakoid, respectively. The changes in steady-state levels observed were significant (p < 0.01 for Tic40, Oee1, Lhcb1*1; and p < 0.05 for Rbcs, Student's t test). The same behavior was replicated in several independent lines, providing verification of the observed trend. Tic110 was used as a per translocon reference point for assessing relative changes to translocon composition as well as relative changes to the level of proteins being accumulated by the plastids. In general, low levels of Tic40 suppression do not appear to affect the steady-state level of the imported proteins assessed (in green seedling tissues) in a manner considered detrimental to the plant. Likewise, substantial increases to Tic40"
