https://openalex.org/W4281616414,"Abstract Autophagy is markedly impaired in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Here we reveal unique autophagy dysregulation within neurons in five AD mouse models in vivo and identify its basis using a neuron-specific transgenic mRFP-eGFP-LC3 probe of autophagy and pH, multiplex confocal imaging and correlative light electron microscopy. Autolysosome acidification declines in neurons well before extracellular amyloid deposition, associated with markedly lowered vATPase activity and build-up of Aβ/APP-βCTF selectively within enlarged de-acidified autolysosomes. In more compromised yet still intact neurons, profuse Aβ-positive autophagic vacuoles (AVs) pack into large membrane blebs forming flower-like perikaryal rosettes. This unique pattern, termed PANTHOS (poisonous anthos (flower)), is also present in AD brains. Additional AVs coalesce into peri-nuclear networks of membrane tubules where fibrillar β-amyloid accumulates intraluminally. Lysosomal membrane permeabilization, cathepsin release and lysosomal cell death ensue, accompanied by microglial invasion. Quantitative analyses confirm that individual neurons exhibiting PANTHOS are the principal source of senile plaques in amyloid precursor protein AD models."

Mixed-matrix membranes, combining processable polymers and selective adsorbents, offer the potential to deploy adsorbent distinct separation properties into processable matrix. We report the rational design and construction of a highly efficient, mixed-matrix metal-organic framework membrane based on three interlocked criteria: (i) a fluorinated metal-organic framework, AlFFIVE-1-Ni, as a molecular sieve adsorbent that selectively enhances hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide diffusion while excluding methane; (ii) tailoring crystal morphology into nanosheets with maximally exposed (001) facets; and (iii) in-plane alignment of (001) nanosheets in polymer matrix and attainment of [001]-oriented membrane. The membrane demonstrated exceptionally high hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide separation from natural gas under practical working conditions. This approach offers great potential to translate other key adsorbents into processable matrix."
https://openalex.org/W4281716380,"Characterizing complex microbial communities with single-cell resolution has been a long-standing goal of microbiology. We present Microbe-seq, a high-throughput method that yields the genomes of individual microbes from complex microbial communities. We encapsulate individual microbes in droplets with microfluidics and liberate their DNA, which we then amplify, tag with droplet-specific barcodes, and sequence. We explore the human gut microbiome, sequencing more than 20,000 microbial single-amplified genomes (SAGs) from a single human donor and coassembling genomes of almost 100 bacterial species, including several with multiple subspecies strains. We use these genomes to probe microbial interactions, reconstructing the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) network and observing HGT between 92 species pairs; we also identify a significant in vivo host-phage association between crAssphage and one strain of Bacteroides vulgatus. Microbe-seq contributes high-throughput culture-free capabilities to investigate genomic blueprints of complex microbial communities with single-microbe resolution."
https://openalex.org/W4281877108,"Abstract Alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) is a major cause of liver-related death worldwide, yet understanding of the three key pathological features of the disease—fibrosis, inflammation and steatosis—remains incomplete. Here, we present a paired liver–plasma proteomics approach to infer molecular pathophysiology and to explore the diagnostic and prognostic capability of plasma proteomics in 596 individuals (137 controls and 459 individuals with ALD), 360 of whom had biopsy-based histological assessment. We analyzed all plasma samples and 79 liver biopsies using a mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics workflow with short gradient times and an enhanced, data-independent acquisition scheme in only 3 weeks of measurement time. In plasma and liver biopsy tissues, metabolic functions were downregulated whereas fibrosis-associated signaling and immune responses were upregulated. Machine learning models identified proteomics biomarker panels that detected significant fibrosis (receiver operating characteristic–area under the curve (ROC–AUC), 0.92, accuracy, 0.82) and mild inflammation (ROC–AUC, 0.87, accuracy, 0.79) more accurately than existing clinical assays (DeLong’s test, P &lt; 0.05). These biomarker panels were found to be accurate in prediction of future liver-related events and all-cause mortality, with a Harrell’s C -index of 0.90 and 0.79, respectively. An independent validation cohort reproduced the diagnostic model performance, laying the foundation for routine MS-based liver disease testing."
https://openalex.org/W4281626861,"Ambitious conservation efforts are needed to stop the global biodiversity crisis. In this study, we estimate the minimum land area to secure important biodiversity areas, ecologically intact areas, and optimal locations for representation of species ranges and ecoregions. We discover that at least 64 million square kilometers (44% of terrestrial area) would require conservation attention (ranging from protected areas to land-use policies) to meet this goal. More than 1.8 billion people live on these lands, so responses that promote autonomy, self-determination, equity, and sustainable management for safeguarding biodiversity are essential. Spatially explicit land-use scenarios suggest that 1.3 million square kilometers of this land is at risk of being converted for intensive human land uses by 2030, which requires immediate attention. However, a sevenfold difference exists between the amount of habitat converted in optimistic and pessimistic land-use scenarios, highlighting an opportunity to avert this crisis. Appropriate targets in the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework to encourage conservation of the identified land would contribute substantially to safeguarding biodiversity."
https://openalex.org/W4281959735,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is mediated, in part, by intraneuronal accumulation of α-synuclein aggregates andsubsequent death of dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Microglial hyperactivation of the NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome has been well-documented in various neurodegenerative diseases, including PD. We show here that loss of parkin activity in mouse and human DA neurons results in spontaneous neuronal NLRP3 inflammasome assembly, leading to DA neuron death. Parkin normally inhibits inflammasome priming by ubiquitinating and targeting NLRP3 for proteasomal degradation. Loss of parkin activity also contributes to the assembly of an active NLRP3 inflammasome complex via mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species (mitoROS) generation through the accumulation of another parkin ubiquitination substrate, ZNF746/PARIS. Inhibition of neuronal NLRP3 inflammasome assembly prevents degeneration of DA neurons in familial and sporadic PD models. Strategies aimed at limiting neuronal NLRP3 inflammasome activation hold promise as a disease-modifying therapy for PD."
https://openalex.org/W4281713460,"The genetic etiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is multifactorial, but how combinations of genetic factors determine risk is unclear. In a large family sample, we show that genetic loads of rare and polygenic risk are inversely correlated in cases and greater in females than in males, consistent with a liability threshold that differs by sex. De novo mutations (DNMs), rare inherited variants and polygenic scores were associated with various dimensions of symptom severity in children and parents. Parental age effects on risk for ASD in offspring were attributable to a combination of genetic mechanisms, including DNMs that accumulate in the paternal germline and inherited risk that influences behavior in parents. Genes implicated by rare variants were enriched in excitatory and inhibitory neurons compared with genes implicated by common variants. Our results suggest that a phenotypic spectrum of ASD is attributable to a spectrum of genetic factors that impact different neurodevelopmental processes."
https://openalex.org/W4281717750,"Global policies call for connecting protected areas (PAs) to conserve the flow of animals and genes across changing landscapes, yet whether global PA networks currently support animal movement-and where connectivity conservation is most critical-remain largely unknown. In this study, we map the functional connectivity of the world's terrestrial PAs and quantify national PA connectivity through the lens of moving mammals. We find that mitigating the human footprint may improve connectivity more than adding new PAs, although both strategies together maximize benefits. The most globally important areas of concentrated mammal movement remain unprotected, with 71% of these overlapping with global biodiversity priority areas and 6% occurring on land with moderate to high human modification. Conservation and restoration of critical connectivity areas could safeguard PA connectivity while supporting other global conservation priorities."
https://openalex.org/W4281618351,"The substantial phenotypic heterogeneity in autism limits our understanding of its genetic etiology. To address this gap, here we investigated genetic differences between autistic individuals (nmax = 12,893) based on core and associated features of autism, co-occurring developmental disabilities and sex. We conducted a comprehensive factor analysis of core autism features in autistic individuals and identified six factors. Common genetic variants were associated with the core factors, but de novo variants were not. We found that higher autism polygenic scores (PGS) were associated with lower likelihood of co-occurring developmental disabilities in autistic individuals. Furthermore, in autistic individuals without co-occurring intellectual disability (ID), autism PGS are overinherited by autistic females compared to males. Finally, we observed higher SNP heritability for autistic males and for autistic individuals without ID. Deeper phenotypic characterization will be critical in determining how the complex underlying genetics shape cognition, behavior and co-occurring conditions in autism."
https://openalex.org/W4281771922,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a growing cause of chronic liver disease. Using a proxy NAFLD definition of chronic elevation of alanine aminotransferase (cALT) levels without other liver diseases, we performed a multiancestry genome-wide association study (GWAS) in the Million Veteran Program (MVP) including 90,408 cALT cases and 128,187 controls. Seventy-seven loci exceeded genome-wide significance, including 25 without prior NAFLD or alanine aminotransferase associations, with one additional locus identified in European American-only and two in African American-only analyses (P < 5 × 10-8). External replication in histology-defined NAFLD cohorts (7,397 cases and 56,785 controls) or radiologic imaging cohorts (n = 44,289) replicated 17 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (P < 6.5 × 10-4), of which 9 were new (TRIB1, PPARG, MTTP, SERPINA1, FTO, IL1RN, COBLL1, APOH and IFI30). Pleiotropy analysis showed that 61 of 77 multiancestry and all 17 replicated SNPs were jointly associated with metabolic and/or inflammatory traits, revealing a complex model of genetic architecture. Our approach integrating cALT, histology and imaging reveals new insights into genetic liability to NAFLD."
https://openalex.org/W4281725765,"Mountains are hotspots of biodiversity and ecosystem services, but they are warming about twice as fast as the global average. Climate change may reduce alpine snow cover and increase vegetation productivity, as in the Arctic. Here, we demonstrate that 77% of the European Alps above the tree line experienced greening (productivity gain) and <1% browning (productivity loss) over the past four decades. Snow cover declined significantly during this time, but in <10% of the area. These trends were only weakly correlated: Greening predominated in warmer areas, driven by climatic changes during summer, while snow cover recession peaked at colder temperatures, driven by precipitation changes. Greening could increase carbon sequestration, but this is unlikely to outweigh negative implications, including reduced albedo and water availability, thawing permafrost, and habitat loss."
https://openalex.org/W4281793572,"Structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) protein complexes structure genomes by extruding DNA loops, but the molecular mechanism that underlies their activity has remained unknown. We show that the active condensin complex entraps the bases of a DNA loop transiently in two separate chambers. Single-molecule imaging and cryo-electron microscopy suggest a putative power-stroke movement at the first chamber that feeds DNA into the SMC-kleisin ring upon adenosine triphosphate binding, whereas the second chamber holds on upstream of the same DNA double helix. Unlocking the strict separation of ""motor"" and ""anchor"" chambers turns condensin from a one-sided into a bidirectional DNA loop extruder. We conclude that the orientation of two topologically bound DNA segments during the SMC reaction cycle determines the directionality of DNA loop extrusion."
https://openalex.org/W4282022737,"The design of materials and their manufacture into membranes that can handle industrial conditions and separate complex nonaqueous mixtures are challenging. We report a versatile strategy to fabricate polytriazole membranes with 10-nanometer-thin selective layers containing subnanometer channels for the separation of hydrocarbons. The process involves the use of the classical nonsolvent-induced phase separation method and thermal cross-linking. The membrane selectivity can be tuned to the lower end of the typical nanofiltration range (200 to 1000 gram mole-1). The polytriazole membrane can enrich up to 80 to 95% of the hydrocarbon content with less than 10 carbon atoms (140 gram mole-1). These membranes preferentially separate paraffin over aromatic components, making them suitable for integration in hybrid distillation systems for crude oil fractionation."
https://openalex.org/W4281730853,"Insects are facing a multitude of anthropogenic stressors, and the recent decline in their biodiversity is threatening ecosystems and economies across the globe. We investigated the impact of glyphosate, the most commonly used herbicide worldwide, on bumblebees. Bumblebee colonies maintain their brood at high temperatures via active thermogenesis, a prerequisite for colony growth and reproduction. Using a within-colony comparative approach to examine the effects of long-term glyphosate exposure on both individual and collective thermoregulation, we found that whereas effects are weak at the level of the individual, the collective ability to maintain the necessary high brood temperatures is decreased by more than 25% during periods of resource limitation. For pollinators in our heavily stressed ecosystems, glyphosate exposure carries hidden costs that have so far been largely overlooked."
https://openalex.org/W4281754067,"Bidirectional signalling between the tumour and stroma shapes tumour aggressiveness and metastasis. ATF4 is a major effector of the Integrated Stress Response, a homeostatic mechanism that couples cell growth and survival to bioenergetic demands. Using conditional knockout ATF4 mice, we show that global, or fibroblast-specific loss of host ATF4, results in deficient vascularization and a pronounced growth delay of syngeneic melanoma and pancreatic tumours. Single-cell transcriptomics of tumours grown in Atf4Δ/Δ mice uncovered a reduction in activation markers in perivascular cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Atf4Δ/Δ fibroblasts displayed significant defects in collagen biosynthesis and deposition and a reduced ability to support angiogenesis. Mechanistically, ATF4 regulates the expression of the Col1a1 gene and levels of glycine and proline, the major amino acids of collagen. Analyses of human melanoma and pancreatic tumours revealed a strong correlation between ATF4 and collagen levels. Our findings establish stromal ATF4 as a key driver of CAF functionality, malignant progression and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W4281700719,"The growing appreciation of immune cell-cell interactions within disease environments has led to extensive efforts to develop immunotherapies. However, characterizing complex cell-cell interfaces in high resolution remains challenging. Thus, technologies leveraging therapeutic-based modalities to profile intercellular environments offer opportunities to study cell-cell interactions with molecular-level insight. We introduce photocatalytic cell tagging (PhoTag) for interrogating cell-cell interactions using single-domain antibodies (VHHs) conjugated to photoactivatable flavin-based cofactors. Following irradiation with visible light, the flavin photocatalyst generates phenoxy radical tags for targeted labeling. Using this technology, we demonstrate selective synaptic labeling across the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in antigen-presenting cell-T cell systems. In combination with multiomics single-cell sequencing, we monitored interactions between peripheral blood mononuclear cells and Raji PD-L1 B cells, revealing differences in transient interactions with specific T cell subtypes. The utility of PhoTag in capturing cell-cell interactions will enable detailed profiling of intercellular communication across different biological systems."
https://openalex.org/W4281666919,"The poor transferability of genetic risk scores (GRSs) derived from European ancestry data in diverse populations is a cause of concern. We set out to evaluate whether GRSs derived from data of African American individuals and multiancestry data perform better in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) compared to European ancestry-derived scores. Using summary statistics from the Million Veteran Program (MVP), we showed that GRSs derived from data of African American individuals enhance polygenic prediction of lipid traits in SSA compared to European and multiancestry scores. However, our GRS prediction varied greatly within SSA between the South African Zulu (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), R2 = 8.14%) and Ugandan cohorts (LDL-C, R2 = 0.026%). We postulate that differences in the genetic and environmental factors between these population groups might lead to the poor transferability of GRSs within SSA. More effort is required to optimize polygenic prediction in Africa."
https://openalex.org/W4281611381,"Aminoacyl transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetases (aaRSs) are attractive drug targets, and we present class I and II aaRSs as previously unrecognized targets for adenosine 5'-monophosphate-mimicking nucleoside sulfamates. The target enzyme catalyzes the formation of an inhibitory amino acid-sulfamate conjugate through a reaction-hijacking mechanism. We identified adenosine 5'-sulfamate as a broad-specificity compound that hijacks a range of aaRSs and ML901 as a specific reagent a specific reagent that hijacks a single aaRS in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, namely tyrosine RS (PfYRS). ML901 exerts whole-life-cycle-killing activity with low nanomolar potency and single-dose efficacy in a mouse model of malaria. X-ray crystallographic studies of plasmodium and human YRSs reveal differential flexibility of a loop over the catalytic site that underpins differential susceptibility to reaction hijacking by ML901."

https://openalex.org/W4281763513,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is highly heterogeneous. Identifying systematic individual differences in neuroanatomy could inform diagnosis and personalized interventions. The challenge is that these differences are entangled with variation because of other causes: individual differences unrelated to ASD and measurement artifacts. We used contrastive deep learning to disentangle ASD-specific neuroanatomical variation from variation shared with typical control participants. ASD-specific variation correlated with individual differences in symptoms. The structure of this ASD-specific variation also addresses a long-standing debate about the nature of ASD: At least in terms of neuroanatomy, individuals do not cluster into distinct subtypes; instead, they are organized along continuous dimensions that affect distinct sets of regions."
https://openalex.org/W4281648773,"Saccharum spontaneum is a founding Saccharum species and exhibits wide variation in ploidy levels. We have assembled a high-quality autopolyploid genome of S. spontaneum Np-X (2n = 4x = 40) into 40 pseudochromosomes across 10 homologous groups, that better elucidates recent chromosome reduction and polyploidization that occurred circa 1.5 million years ago (Mya). One paleo-duplicated chromosomal pair in Saccharum, NpChr5 and NpChr8, underwent fission followed by fusion accompanied by centromeric split around 0.80 Mya. We inferred that Np-X, with x = 10, most likely represents the ancestral karyotype, from which x = 9 and x = 8 evolved. Resequencing of 102 S. spontaneum accessions revealed that S. spontaneum originated in northern India from an x = 10 ancestor, which then radiated into four major groups across the Indian subcontinent, China, and Southeast Asia. Our study suggests new directions for accelerating sugarcane improvement and expands our knowledge of the evolution of autopolyploids."
https://openalex.org/W4281711214,"Abstract The distinct activities of organelles depend on the proper function of their membranes. Coordinated membrane biogenesis of different organelles necessitates lipid transport from their site of synthesis to their destination. Several factors have been proposed to participate in lipid distribution, but despite its basic importance, in vivo evidence linking the absence of putative transport pathways to specific transport defects remains scarce. A reason for this scarcity is the near absence of in vivo lipid trafficking assays. Here we introduce a versatile method named METALIC (Mass tagging-Enabled TrAcking of Lipids In Cells) to track interorganelle lipid flux inside cells. In this strategy, two enzymes, one directed to a ‘donor’ and the other to an ‘acceptor’ organelle, add two distinct mass tags to lipids. Mass-spectrometry-based detection of lipids bearing the two mass tags is then used to quantify exchange between the two organelles. By applying this approach, we show that the ERMES and Vps13–Mcp1 complexes have transport activity in vivo, and unravel their relative contributions to endoplasmic reticulum–mitochondria lipid exchange."
https://openalex.org/W4281781931,"The long neck of the giraffe has been held as a classic example of adaptive evolution since Darwin's time. Here we report on an unusual fossil giraffoid, Discokeryx xiezhi, from the early Miocene, which has an unusual disk-shaped headgear and the most complicated head-neck joints in known mammals. The distinctive morphology and our finite element analyses indicate an adaptation for fierce head-butting behavior. Tooth enamel isotope data suggest that D. xiezhi occupied a niche different from that of other herbivores, comparable to the characteristic high-level browsing niche of modern giraffes. The study shows that giraffoids exhibit a higher headgear diversity than other ruminants and that living in specific ecological niches may have fostered various intraspecific combat behaviors that resulted in extreme head-neck morphologies in different giraffoid lineages."

https://openalex.org/W4281874266,"Abstract Evidence linking parental inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with autism in children is inconclusive. We conducted four complementary studies to investigate associations between parental IBD and autism in children, and elucidated their underlying etiology. Conducting a nationwide population-based cohort study using Swedish registers, we found evidence of associations between parental diagnoses of IBD and autism in children. Polygenic risk score analyses of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children suggested associations between maternal genetic liability to IBD and autistic traits in children. Two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses provided evidence of a potential causal effect of genetic liability to IBD, especially ulcerative colitis, on autism. Linkage disequilibrium score regression did not indicate a genetic correlation between IBD and autism. Triangulating evidence from these four complementary approaches, we found evidence of a potential causal link between parental, particularly maternal, IBD and autism in children. Perinatal immune dysregulation, micronutrient malabsorption and anemia may be implicated."
https://openalex.org/W4281967495,"The rarity of parthenogenetic species is typically attributed to the reduced genetic variability that accompanies the absence of sex, yet natural parthenogens can be surprisingly successful. Ecological success is often proposed to derive from hybridization through enhanced genetic diversity from repetitive origins or enhanced phenotypic breadth from heterosis. Here, we tested and rejected both hypotheses in a classic parthenogen, the diploid grasshopper Warramaba virgo. Genetic data revealed a single hybrid mating origin at least 0.25 million years ago, and comparative analyses of 14 physiological and life history traits showed no evidence for altered fitness relative to its sexual progenitors. Our findings imply that the rarity of parthenogenesis is due to constraints on origin rather than to rapid extinction."

The aquaculture industry is a significant contributor towards meeting the dietary requirements of a majority of the global population, which further warrants developing novel approaches for enhancing the production of dietary fish. This study was performed to assess the growth performance of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) fingerlings (1 gm in average weight and 2.75 cm in average length) upon nano-selenium (Se-Nps) supplementation. Nanoselenium was synthesized using high-energy ball milling (HEBM) using a 10-hour dry milling technique at 10:1 ball-to-powder ratio (BPR), size characterized by XRD and TEM, followed by mixing with basal feed in desired concentrations (0.5 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, and 2 mg/kg) and administration to Nile tilapia fingerlings for 30 days, followed by the evaluation of growth performance parameters, fatty acid profile analysis using GC-MS, and nutritional quality index (NQI): [Thrombogenicity Index (IT), Atherogenicity Index (IA), n-3/n-6, n-6/n-3)]. Nile tilapia supplemented with 1 mg/kg Se-Nps showed improved growth performance (RGR: 1576.04%, SGR: 4.70%, and FCR: 1.91), demonstrated by higher survivability (> 95%), isometric growth (coefficient of allometry, b = 2.81), and higher weight gain compared to control (RGR: 680.41%, SGR: 3.42%, and FCR: 1.31), 0.5 mg/kg Se-Nps (RGR: 770.83%, SGR: 3.61%, and FCR: 1.18) and 2 mg/kg Se-Nps (RGR: 383.67%, SGR: 2.63%, and FCR: 1.22). The average length-weight relationship assessed as the condition factor (K) was highest in the 1 mg/kg Se-Nps group compared to others (p < 0.05). GC-MS analysis revealed that Nile tilapia supplemented with 1 mg/kg Se-Nps showed better meat quality, higher amount of n-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid, high PUFA/SAFA ratios (1.35) and n-3/n-6 (0.33) ratios, with low atherogenicity index (0.36) and thrombogenic index (0.44), and relatively low n-6/n-3 fatty acid ratio (3.00) compared to other groups. Overall, Se-Nps supplementation at 1 mg/kg enhanced the growth performance and meat quality in Nile tilapia, and therefore could be a potential growth-promoting micronutrient for aquaculture enhancement."

Here, we show that CsgA can form stable homodimeric species that correlate with faster α-synuclein amyloid aggregation. Furthermore, we identify and characterize new CsgA homologs encoded by bacteria present in the human microbiome. These CsgA homologs display diverse aggregation kinetics, and they differ in their ability to modulate α-synuclein aggregation. Remarkably, we demonstrate that slowing down CsgA aggregation leads to an increased acceleration of α-synuclein aggregation, suggesting that the intrinsic amyloidogenicity of gut bacterial CsgA homologs affects their ability to accelerate α-synuclein aggregation. Finally, we identify a complex between CsgA and α-synuclein that functions as a platform to accelerate α-synuclein aggregation.

Taken together, our work reveals complex interplay between bacterial amyloids and α-synuclein that better informs our understanding of PD causation. Amyloids are highly ordered, fibrous quaternary structures formed by the assembly of protein or peptide monomers into stacked cross β-sheets (1Greenwald J. Riek R.

While there are naturally occurring functional amyloids, amyloids and amyloid formation are more commonly associated with protein misfolding and human diseases (3Knowles T.P.J. Vendruscolo M.

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the world with more than 10 million patients (4El-Turabi A.

The canonical pathophysiological hallmark of PD is the abnormal accumulation of a neuronal protein α-synuclein into insoluble amyloid aggregates which eventually leads to the death of dopaminergic neurons (5Antony P.M.A. Diederich N.J. Krüger R. Balling R. The hallmarks of Parkinson’s disease.FEBS J. 2013; 280: 5981-5993Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Currently treatments for PD are limited to relieving late-stage symptoms rather than stopping disease progression (6Stoker T.B. Torsney K.M. Barker R.A. Emerging treatment approaches for Parkinson’s disease.Front. Neurosci. 2018; 12: 693Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This has given rise to the need for studying PD pathology at early stages of the disease. Historically, PD has been mainly studied within the central nervous system. However, it is interesting to note that nonmotor symptoms of PD such as gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction often precede the onset of motor symptoms by years (7Savica R. Carlin J.M. Grossardt B.R.

It appears that the vagus nerve serves as a bidirectional gateway between the enteric nervous system which innervates the gut and the brain (16Furness J.B. Callaghan B.P. Rivera L.R. Cho H.-J.

Moreover, emerging new studies have pointed toward truncal vagotomy and removal of the appendix to correlate with a decreased risk of PD in humans (17Svensson E. Horváth-Puhó E. Thomsen R.W.

All these studies suggest a potential role for the GI tract in PD. This connection is not surprising, given the fact that the gut–brain axis has been shown to be an important factor in many neurological conditions (19Mayer E.A. Padua D. Tillisch K.

Signals from the gut microbiota to distant organs in physiology and disease.Nat. Med. 2016; 22: 1079-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). The GI tract is home to a large and diverse ecosystem of microorganisms, which play an important role in various physiological processes (21Fung T.C. Olson C.A. Hsiao E.Y.

In the case of PD, several studies have revealed differences in the gut microbiome diversity between healthy individuals and PD patients (24Scheperjans F. Aho V. Pereira P.A.B. Koskinen K. Paulin L.

However, it is still unclear whether this change in the gut microbiome diversity is a cause or effect of PD. In a recent study, Sampson et al. (28Sampson T.R. Debelius J.W. Thron T. Janssen S. Shastri G.G. Ilhan Z.E. et al.Gut microbiota regulate motor deficits and neuroinflammation in a model of Parkinson’s disease.Cell. 2016; 167: 1469-1480.e12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1584) Google Scholar) reported that in germ-free α-synuclein overexpressing mice, fecal transplant of PD patients promoted α-synuclein–mediated motor deficits and brain pathology compared to the control group. This study for the first time experimentally demonstrated the involvement of the gut microbiome in PD. The National Institutes of Health Human Microbiome Project identified 823 unique species of bacteria including 72 species from the Enterobacteriaceae family in the GI track (29Methé B.A. Nelson K.E.

Chinwalla A.T. et al.The Human Microbiome Project ConsortiumStructure, function and diversity of the healthy human microbiome.Nature. 2012; 486: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (6500) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown a higher Enterobacteriaceae abundance in PD patients compared to healthy individuals (24Scheperjans F. Aho V. Pereira P.A.B. Koskinen K. Paulin L. Pekkonen E. et al.Gut microbiota are related to Parkinson’s disease and clinical phenotype.Movement Disord. 2015; 30: 350-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Bacteria belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family can produce a functional amyloid called curli (31Barnhart M.M. Chapman M.R. Curli biogenesis and function.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 131-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). In addition to Enterobacteriaceae, the curli operon is widespread among diverse phyla (32Dueholm M.S. Albertsen M. Otzen D. Nielsen P.H. Curli functional amyloid systems are phylogenetically widespread and display large diversity in operon and protein structure.PLoS One. 2012; 7e51274Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The major component of the curli amyloid fibers is a protein called CsgA (33Chapman M.R. Robinson L.S. Pinkner J.S. Roth R. Heuser J. Hammar M. et al.Role of <em>Escherichia coli</em> curli operons in directing amyloid fiber formation.Science. 2002; 295: 851-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). CsgA is secreted outside the cell as an unstructured protein via a dedicated secretion system (34Bhoite S. van Gerven N. Chapman M. Remaut H.

Diversity, biogenesis and function of microbial amyloids.Trends Microbiol. 2012; 20: 66-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Once outside the cell, CsgA aggregates into curli fibers, which help the bacteria in biofilm formation, host cell attachment, and defense against bacteriophages (36Andreasen M. Meisl G. Taylor J.D.

Dynamic biofilm architecture confers individual and collective mechanisms of viral protection.Nat. Microbiol. 2018; 3: 26-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Exposure to Escherichia coli curli fibers increases α-synuclein aggregation in the guts and brains of rats and Caenorhabditis elegans (39Chen S.G. Stribinskis V. Rane M.J. Demuth D.R. Gozal E. Roberts A.M. et al.Exposure to the functional bacterial amyloid protein curli enhances alpha-synuclein aggregation in aged fischer 344 rats and Caenorhabditis elegans.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 34477Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). More recently, a direct link between the gut microbiome and PD was revealed. In germ-free α-synuclein overexpressing mice, colonization with curli producing E. coli promoted α-synuclein pathology in the brain and led to enhanced motor symptoms (40Sampson T.R. Challis C. Jain N. Moiseyenko A. Ladinsky M.S. Shastri G.G. et al.A gut bacterial amyloid promotes α-synuclein aggregation and motor impairment in mice.eLife. 2020; 9e53111Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These studies promoted us to ask whether the human gut microbiome harbors curli-producing bacteria from the Enterobacteriaceae family that would influence α-synuclein aggregation. Here, we report the characterization of CsgA homologs from the human gut microbiome and their role in α-synuclein aggregation. Four gut bacterial CsgA homologs were identified that are encoded by bacteria present in the human microbiome. These four CsgA homologs were cloned, purified, and biochemically assessed for their amyloid-forming properties. The ability of CsgA homologs to accelerate α-synuclein aggregation was correlated to their intrinsic amyloid-forming propensities, wherein slow-aggregating CsgA homologs had a greater ability to accelerate α-synuclein aggregation than fast-aggregating CsgA homologs. Native ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS) was used to probe the oligomeric states of the homologs and average collision cross sections (CCSs) were also measured. We found that the dimeric CsgA species was in a compacted conformation in slow-aggregating CsgA homologs, which correlated with their ability to accelerate α-synuclein aggregation. Based on our data, we propose a mechanism wherein the intermediate metastable species of CsgA homologs can accelerate α-synuclein aggregation. Our study presents a workflow to further understand the interplay between gut bacterial amyloids and PD pathogenesis. E. coli CsgA (EC CsgA) is composed of five conserved imperfect repeat units designated R1-R5, each with a Q-X4-N-X5-Q consensus sequence (41Wang X. Smith D.R. Jones J.W. Chapman M.R. In vitro polymerization of a functional Escherichia coli amyloid protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3713-3719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Each repeating unit is predicted to form a strand-loop-strand motif covalently linked to each other to resemble a β-helical structure (42DeBenedictis E.P. Ma D. Keten S. Structural predictions for curli amyloid fibril subunits CsgA and CsgB.RSC Adv. 2017; 7: 48102-48112Crossref Google Scholar, 43Collinson S.K. Parker J.M.R. Hodges R.S. Kay W.W.

Biol. 1999; 290: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Mutational studies have revealed the importance of this motif in promoting CsgA amyloid formation (44Wang X. Chapman M.R. Sequence determinants of bacterial amyloid formation.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 380: 570-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To investigate the presence of CsgA homologs in human gut microbiome, we used the reference genomes of bacteria isolated from the GI tract and deposited to the National Institutes of Health Human Microbiome Project (29Methé B.A. Nelson K.E. Pop M. Creasy H.H. Giglio M.G. Huttenhower C. et al.The Human Microbiome Project ConsortiumA framework for human microbiome research.Nature. 2012; 486: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar, 30Huttenhower C. Gevers D. Knight R. Abubucker S. Badger J.H. Chinwalla A.T. et al.The Human Microbiome Project ConsortiumStructure, function and diversity of the healthy human microbiome.Nature. 2012; 486: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (6500) Google Scholar). This dataset has 823 reference genomes, including 61 unique Enterobacteriaceae family E. coli strains. Each unique Enterobacteriaceae species was scanned for CsgA homologs and all the other proteins in the curli operon. For this study, we focused on four CsgA homologs based on their sequence diversity compared to EC CsgA, namely, Hafnia alvei (HA CsgA), Yokenella regensburgei (YR CsgA), Citrobacter youngae (CY CsgA), and Cedecea davisae (CD CsgA). HA CsgA displayed the least similarity to EC CsgA with only 31% sequence identity, while CY CsgA shared 67% sequence identity with EC CsgA (Table S1). Despite the sequence diversity within the CsgA homologs, sequence alignment with EC CsgA revealed the presence of the conserved Q-X4-N-X5-Q consensus sequence (Fig. 1A). To characterize the amyloid-forming capabilities of the CsgA homologs from H. alvei, Y. regensburgei, C. youngae, and C. davisae, each sequence was cloned into pET28a vector and then expressed and purified as described in the Experimental procedures (Table S3). The ability of each CsgA homolog to adopt an amyloid-like fiber was first assessed using a Thioflavin-T (ThT) fluorescence assay (45Xue, C., Lin, T. Y., Chang, D., and Guo, Z. Thioflavin T as an amyloid dye: Fibril quantification, optimal concentration and effect on aggregation. R. Soc. Open Sci. 4, 160696Google Scholar, 46Naiki H. Higuchi K. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Fluorometric determination of amyloid fibrils in vitro using the fluorescent dye, thioflavine T.Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). As reported previously (47Jain N. Ådén J. Nagamatsu K. Evans M.L. Li X. McMichael B. et al.Inhibition of curli assembly and <em>Escherichia coli</em> biofilm formation by the human systemic amyloid precursor transthyretin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2017; 114: 12184Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), EC CsgA fibrillation kinetics show a typical sigmoidal aggregation behavior, wherein the ThT fluorescence increases after a lag time of 2.5 ± 0.5 h at 25 °C (Fig. S1A). At 37 °C, the lag time was reduced to approximately 1 h (Fig. S1A). Interestingly, compared to EC CsgA, HA CsgA and YR CsgA showed a delayed lag phase of ∼10 h and ∼1.5 h, respectively, while CY CsgA and CD CsgA showed rapid aggregation with a lag phase of ∼0.5 h (Fig. 1, B and C). The β-sheet–rich amyloid nature of the CsgA homologs was confirmed by far-UV circular dichroism (CD) of the fibers after 48 h of incubation (Fig. S1B), and the purity of the cloned CsgA homologs was confirmed by SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. S1, C–F) and native IM-MS (see below). We next looked at the fiber morphology with a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and each of the CsgA homologs assembled into fibers that were similar in appearance to those made by EC CsgA (Fig. 1, D and G). To test whether gut bacterial CsgA homologs would form amyloid fibers in vivo, E. coli cells lacking endogenous CsgA were transformed with plasmids that expressed the CsgA homologs. In E. coli, assembly of CsgA fibers is guided by the Type VIII secretion system (34Bhoite S. van Gerven N. Chapman M. Remaut H. Curli biogenesis: bacterial amyloid assembly by the type VIII secretion pathway.EcoSal Plus. 2019; https://doi.org/10.1128/ecosalplus.ESP-0037-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). After CsgA monomers are secreted to the extracellular space, curli amyloid fiber formation is initiated by the outer membrane–associated CsgB nucleator protein (34Bhoite S. van Gerven N. Chapman M. Remaut H. Curli biogenesis: bacterial amyloid assembly by the type VIII secretion pathway.EcoSal Plus. 2019; https://doi.org/10.1128/ecosalplus.ESP-0037-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). CsgA homologs from Salmonella typhimurium LT2 and Citrobacter koseri have also been shown to be cross-seeded by E. coli CsgB both in vitro and in vivo (48Zhou Y. Smith D. Leong B.J. Brännström K. Almqvist F. Chapman M.R. Promiscuous cross-seeding between bacterial amyloids promotes interspecies biofilms.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 35092-35103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We thus expressed the CsgA homologs identified from the gut microbiome under the native E. coli csgBAC promoter in an E. coli MC4100 ΔcsgA strain (LSR10) (Table S4). To facilitate the extracellular export and assembly, we fused the N-terminal 22 amino acid sequence of EC CsgA (N22) to the different CsgA homologs so that each homolog could be expressed in an E. coli ΔcsgA strain and assessed for its ability to assemble into a curli amyloid fiber on the cell surface. Strains that assemble extracellular amyloid fibers stain red on Congo red indicator plates, while strains that cannot make extracellular amyloid appear in white or light pink (49Zhou Y. Smith D.R. Hufnagel D.A. Chapman M.R. Experimental manipulation of the microbial functional amyloid called curli.in: Delcour A.H. Bacterial Cell Surfaces: Methods and Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2013: 53-75https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-62703-245-2_4Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). WT E. coli MC4100 formed red colonies after 48 h incubation at 26 °C (Fig. 2A). The ΔcsgA mutant strain and the ΔcsgA mutant strain that contained the empty vector pLR2 formed white, nonstained colonies on Congo red indicator plates (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, ΔcsgA strains that harbored plasmids that expressed EC CsgA or any of the gut bacterial CsgA homologs stained red, indicating curli amyloid formation occurred (Fig. 2A). Whole-cell TEM revealed the presence of cell membrane–associated curli fibers which were indistinguishable from those produced by WT MC4100 or by MC4100:ΔcsgA transformed with a pLR5 plasmid that expresses EC CsgA protein (Fig. 2,B–I). Cell membrane–associated CsgA fibers were also detected in whole cell lysates by Western blot with 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP) treatment (Fig. S2A). Interestingly, HA CsgA fibers were detected even without HFIP treatment, indicating the SDS-soluble nature of HA CsgA amyloid fibers. To determine if the Congo red positive fibers produced on the surface of E. coli were dependent on the CsgB nucleator protein, we performed a similar complementation assay in an E. coli MC4100 ΔcsgBA (LSR13) background. The absence of red colored colonies (Fig. S2B) and cell membrane–associated curli fibers (Fig. S2, C–J) when gut bacterial CsgA homologs were expressed in ΔcsgBA background indicated that CsgA amyloid formation in vivo was CsgB dependent and not due to the extracellular aggregation of CsgA homologs. We tested the effect of gut bacterial CsgA homologs on α-synuclein aggregation. EC CsgA has been demonstrated to accelerate α-synuclein amyloid formation (40Sampson T.R. Challis C. Jain N. Moiseyenko A. Ladinsky M.S. Shastri G.G. et al.A gut bacterial amyloid promotes α-synuclein aggregation and motor impairment in mice.eLife. 2020; 9e53111Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The lag phase of α-synuclein aggregation when 50 μM of α-synuclein was mixed with 2.5 μM of EC CsgA (molar ratio of 1.0:0.05 α-synuclein:EC CsgA) was reduced by more than half (Fig. S3A). Similarly, in the presence of 2.5 μM HA CsgA and YR CsgA, α-synuclein aggregation was significantly accelerated with the lag phase of aggregation reduced by more than half as compared to α-synuclein alone (Figs. 3A and S3, B and D). Interestingly, at the same concentrations, CY CsgA and CD CsgA did not show significant acceleration of α-synuclein amyloid formation (Figs. 3B and S3, C and E). To investigate this further, we varied the concentration of CsgA homologs and observed the effect on α-synuclein aggregation. We found that the slower aggregating CsgA homologs, HA CsgA and YR CsgA, accelerated α-synuclein aggregation at all the concentrations tested, whereas the faster aggregating CsgA homologs, CY CsgA, and CD CsgA, accelerated α-synuclein aggregation only at low concentration of 0.5 μM, that is, a molar ratio of 1.0:0.01 α-synuclein:CY/CD CsgA. (Fig. S4, A–H). The α-synuclein fibers made in the presence of CsgA homologs were analyzed by TEM and far-UV CD. Analysis of the secondary structure by CD revealed minor differences in α-synuclein fibers made in presence or absence of gut bacterial CsgA homologs (Fig. S5A and Table S2). In agreement with previous reports (50Li B. Ge P. Murray K.A. Sheth P. Zhang M. Nair G. et al.Cryo-EM of full-length α-synuclein reveals fibril polymorphs with a common structural kernel.Nat.

A. 1998; 95: 6469-6473Crossref PubMed Scopus (2313) Google Scholar), TEM under direct magnification of 25,000 to 30,000× showed that α-synuclein fibers formed in the absence of CsgA appeared as rod-like, nontwisted filaments (Fig. S5B). The rod-like, nontwisted filaments were also observed in α-synuclein fibers made in the presence of HA CsgA (Fig. S5C). Interestingly, α-synuclein fibers generated in the presence of EC CsgA, CY CsgA, and CD CsgA had darkly stained cross bands that suggested that the fibers were twisted (Fig. S5, D–F, black arrows). Our previous work has identified key “gatekeeper” residues in EC CsgA that modulate its assembly into amyloid fibers. Deletion or substitution of these gatekeeper residues in EC CsgA results in faster amyloid aggregation kinetics in vitro (53Wang X. Zhou Y. Ren J.-J. Hammer N.D. Chapman M.R. Gatekeeper residues in the major curlin subunit modulate bacterial amyloid fiber biogenesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2010; 107: 163Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of the gut bacterial CsgA homologs showed that HA CsgA and YR CsgA had many of the same gatekeeper residues that EC CsgA has, while CY CsgA and CD CsgA lacked majority of the EC CsgA gatekeeper residues (Fig. S6A). The absence of key gatekeeper residues in CY CsgA and CD CsgA might explain the rapid aggregation kinetics of these two CsgA homologs (Fig. 1B). Since only slow-aggregating HA CsgA and YR CsgA accelerated α-synuclein aggregation, we hypothesized that the slower aggregating CsgA homologs accelerate α-synuclein aggregation due to low intrinsic amyloid-forming ability compared to the faster aggregating CsgA homologs. To test our hypothesis, we introduced gatekeeper residues into CY CsgA and CD CsgA to slow down their aggregation kinetics. Three amino acid residues in CY CsgA were changed to gatekeeper residues, V78D, S89D, and N125D to get CY Gatekeeper CsgA (CYGK CsgA). In the case of CD CsgA, we substituted the four nongatekeeper residues to gatekeeper residues, K66D, S90D, K77D, and N113D to get CD Gatekeeper CsgA (CDGK CsgA). Strikingly, CYGK CsgA showed delayed amyloid formati"

https://openalex.org/W4281655964,"Abstract Protein tertiary structure mimetics are valuable tools to target large protein–protein interaction interfaces. Here, we demonstrate a strategy for designing dimeric helix-hairpin motifs from a previously reported three-helix-bundle miniprotein that targets the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Through truncation of the third helix and optimization of the interhelical loop residues of the miniprotein, we developed a thermostable dimeric helix-hairpin. The dimeric four-helix bundle competes with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in binding to RBD with 2:2 stoichiometry. Cryogenic-electron microscopy revealed the formation of dimeric spike ectodomain trimer by the four-helix bundle, where all the three RBDs from either spike protein are attached head-to-head in an open conformation, revealing a novel mechanism for virus neutralization. The proteomimetic protects hamsters from high dose viral challenge with replicative SARS-CoV-2 viruses, demonstrating the promise of this class of peptides that inhibit protein–protein interaction through target dimerization."

Despite accumulating knowledge of the brain regions involved in aggression, the specific vomeronasal receptors and the exact neural circuits responsible for pheromone-mediated aggression remain unknown. Here, we identified one murine vomeronasal receptor, Vmn2r53, that is activated by urine from males of various strains and is responsible for evoking intermale aggression. We prepared a purified pheromonal fraction and Vmn2r53 knockout mice and applied genetic tools for neuronal activity recording, manipulation, and circuit tracing to decipher the neural mechanisms underlying Vmn2r53-mediated aggression. We found that Vmn2r53-mediated aggression is regulated by specific neuronal populations in the ventral premammillary nucleus and the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus. Together, our results shed light on the hypothalamic regulation of male aggression mediated by a single vomeronasal receptor."
https://openalex.org/W4281642874,"As a typical pathogen-associated molecular pattern, bacterial flagellin can bind Toll-like receptor 5 and the intracellular NAIP5 receptor component of the NLRC4 inflammasome to induce immune responses in mammals. However, these flagellin receptors are generally poorly understood in lower animal species. In this study, we found that the isolated flagellum of Vibrio splendidus AJ01 destroyed the integrity of the tissue structure of coelomocytes and promoted apoptosis in the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus. To further investigate the molecular mechanism, the novel intracellular LRR domain-containing protein tropomodulin (AjTmod) was identified as a protein that interacts with flagellin C (FliC) with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.0086 ± 0.33 μM by microscale thermophoresis assay. We show that knockdown of AjTmod also depressed FliC-induced apoptosis of coelomocytes. Further functional analysis with different inhibitor treatments revealed that the interaction between AjTmod and FliC could specifically activate p38 MAPK, but not JNK or ERK MAP kinases. We demonstrate that the transcription factor p38 is then translocated into the nucleus, where it mediates the expression of p53 to induce coelomocyte apoptosis. Our findings provide the first evidence that intracellular AjTmod serves as a novel receptor of FliC and mediates p53-dependent coelomocyte apoptosis by activating the p38 MAPK signaling pathway in Echinodermata."

As a result, research on this subject is urgently needed to develop appropriate countermeasures. This study builds on Person-Environment fit theory to investigate social connections at work and mental health during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. It analyses employees' needs for social connections and how social connections affect different mental health measures. Data were collected in May 2020 in an online survey of employees across Germany and analysed using response surface analysis. Mental health was measured as positive mental health and mental health disorders. Social connections were measured as social support and social interactions. 507 employees participated in the survey and more than one third reported having less social support and social interaction at work than they desired (p < .001). This was associated with a decrease in mental health. In contrast, having more than the desired amount of social support was associated with a decrease, and having more than the desired amount of social interaction with an increase, in mental health. This study provides important early evidence on the impact of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the workplace. With it, we aim to stimulate further research in the field and provide early evidence on the potential mental health consequences of social distancing-while also opening avenues to combat them."
https://openalex.org/W4281670068,"The cytosolic iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster assembly (CIA) pathway delivers Fe-S clusters to nuclear and cytosolic Fe-S proteins involved in essential cellular functions. Although the delivery process is regulated by the availability of iron and oxygen, it remains unclear how CIA components orchestrate the cluster transfer under varying cellular environments. Here, we utilized a targeted proteomics assay for monitoring CIA factors and substrates to characterize the CIA machinery. We find that nucleotide-binding protein 1 (NUBP1/NBP35), cytosolic iron-sulfur assembly component 3 (CIAO3/NARFL), and CIA substrates associate with nucleotide-binding protein 2 (NUBP2/CFD1), a component of the CIA scaffold complex. NUBP2 also weakly associates with the CIA targeting complex (MMS19, CIAO1, and CIAO2B) indicating the possible existence of a higher order complex. Interactions between CIAO3 and the CIA scaffold complex are strengthened upon iron supplementation or low oxygen tension, while iron chelation and reactive oxygen species weaken CIAO3 interactions with CIA components. We further demonstrate that CIAO3 mutants defective in Fe-S cluster binding fail to integrate into the higher order complexes. However, these mutants exhibit stronger associations with CIA substrates under conditions in which the association with the CIA targeting complex is reduced suggesting that CIAO3 and CIA substrates may associate in complexes independently of the CIA targeting complex. Together, our data suggest that CIA components potentially form a metabolon whose assembly is regulated by environmental cues and requires Fe-S cluster incorporation in CIAO3. These findings provide additional evidence that the CIA pathway adapts to changes in cellular environment through complex reorganization."
https://openalex.org/W4281851622,"Adding abiraterone acetate (AA) plus prednisolone (P) to standard of care (SOC) improves survival in newly diagnosed advanced prostate cancer (PC) patients starting hormone therapy. Our objective was to determine the value for money to the English National Health Service (NHS) of adding AAP to SOC. We used a decision analytic model to evaluate cost-effectiveness of providing AAP in the English NHS. Between 2011-2014, the STAMPEDE trial recruited 1917 men with high-risk localised, locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic PC starting first-line androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), and they were randomised to receive SOC plus AAP, or SOC alone. Lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were estimated using STAMPEDE trial data supplemented with literature data where necessary, adjusting for baseline patient and disease characteristics. British National Formulary (BNF) prices (£98/day) were applied for AAP. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.5%/year. AAP was not cost-effective. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was £149,748/QALY gained in the non-metastatic (M0) subgroup, with 2.4% probability of being cost-effective at NICE's £30,000/QALY threshold; and the metastatic (M1) subgroup had an ICER of £47,503/QALY gained, with 12.0% probability of being cost-effective. Scenario analysis suggested AAP could be cost-effective in M1 patients if priced below £62/day, or below £28/day in the M0 subgroup. AAP could dominate SOC in the M0 subgroup with price below £11/day. AAP is effective for non-metastatic and metastatic disease but is not cost-effective when using the BNF price. AAP currently only has UK approval for use in a subset of M1 patients. The actual price currently paid by the English NHS for abiraterone acetate is unknown. Broadening AAP's indication and having a daily cost below the thresholds described above is recommended, given AAP improves survival in both subgroups and its cost-saving potential in M0 subgroup."
https://openalex.org/W4281870007,"The study explored the socioeconomic and demographic factors that determine the onset of difficulty, recovery from difficulty and difficulty remaining in functional activity in later years of life. Additionally, the study examined the effects of several combinations of chronic diseases on the changes in later-life functional difficulty.We used data from two rounds of India Human Development Survey (IHDS) conducted during 2004-2005 and 2011-2012. A sample of 13,849 respondents aged 55 years and above with a seven year follow-up was considered for this study. The Katz Index of Independence in activities of daily living (ADL) was used to measure the functional disability as an outcome variable. Multinomial logistic regression has been conducted to fulfil the study objectives.The overall functional difficulty among older adults was 27.3% and onset of functional difficulty (23.5%) was higher than the recovery from difficulty (2.1%) and remaining with difficulty (1.7%). Onset of functional difficulty in second round was higher among women (27.3%) than men (19.3%). Bivariate and multivariate analyses showed that single and multi-morbidity had a positive significant association with all categories of functional difficulty. Female sex, increasing age and rural place of residence had positive association with onset of difficulty and difficulty remaining in second round. The combinations of morbidities were also found to have positive significant association with functional difficulty i.e., the relative risk (RR) of onset of difficulty in second round is higher among those who had diabetes with high blood pressure (RR-1.7; CI: 1.4-2.0), cataracts with high blood pressure (RR-2.0; CI: 1.5-2.6) and cataracts with asthma (RR-3.1; CI: 2.1-4.6) compared to those with no diabetes and cataract but with high blood pressure or asthma, respectively.The findings suggest that the risk of onset of functional difficulty is higher among older individuals with single and multiple morbidities compared to their healthy counterparts. It is also found that functional difficulty increased with age and was more prevalent in older women and rural residents, suggesting the need for appropriate policy interventions with special focus on the vulnerable senior adults."
https://openalex.org/W4281640846,"Four types of flowerlike manganese dioxide in nano scale was synthesized via a liquid phase method in KMnO4-H2SO4 solution and Cu particles, wherein the effect of Cu particles was investigated in detail. The obtained manganese dioxide powder was characterized by XRD, SEM and TEM, and the supercapacity properties of MnO2 electrode materials were measured. The results showed that doping carbon black can benefit to better dispersion of copper particles, resulting in generated smaller size of Cu particles, and the morphology of MnO2 nanoparticles was dominated by that of Cu particles. The study of MnO2 synthesis by different sources of Cu particles showed that the size of MnO2 particles decreased significantly with freshly prepared fine copper powder compared with using commercial Cu powder, and the size of MnO2 particles can be further reduced to 120 nm by prepared Cu particles with smaller size. Therefore, it was suggested that the copper particles served as not only the reductant and but also the nuclei centre for the growth of MnO2 particles in synthesis process MnO2, and that is the reason how copper particles worked on the growth of flower-like MnO2 and electrochemical property. In the part of investigation for electrochemical property, the calculated results of b values indicated that the electrode materials have pseudo capacitance property, and the highest specific capacitance of 197.2 F g-1 at 2 mV s-1 and 148 F/g at 1 A/g were obtained for MCE electrode materials (MnO2 was synthesized with freshly prepared copper particles, where carbon black was used and dispersed in ethanol before preparation of Cu particles). The values of charge transfer resistance in all types of MnO2 materials electrodes were smaller than 0.08 Ω. The cycling retention of MCE material electrode is still kept as 93.8% after 1000 cycles."
https://openalex.org/W4281668703,"Invadopodia on cancer cells play crucial roles in tumor invasion and metastasis by degrading and remodeling the surrounding extracellular matrices and driving cell migration in complex 3D environments. Previous studies have indicated that microtubules (MTs) play a crucial role in elongation of invadopodia, but not their formation, probably by regulating delivery of membrane and secretory proteins within invadopodia. However, the identity of the responsible MT-based molecular motors and their regulation has been elusive. Here, we show that KIF1C, a member of kinesin-3 family, is localized to the tips of invadopodia and is required for their elongation and the invasion of cancer cells. We also found that c-Src phosphorylates tyrosine residues within the stalk domain of KIF1C, thereby enhancing its association with tyrosine phosphatase PTPD1, that in turn activates MT-binding ability of KIF1C, probably by relieving the autoinhibitory interaction between its motor and stalk domains. These findings shed new insights into how c-Src signaling is coupled to the MT-dependent dynamic nature of invadopodia and also advance our understanding of the mechanism of KIF1C activation through release of its autoinhibition."
https://openalex.org/W4281722713,"Background Trifluridine/tipiracil (TFTD), with or without bevacizumab (Bev), and regorafenib are salvage chemotherapy options for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Here, we examined the influence of precedent drug on the efficacy of subsequent drug. Method The subjects were patients with mCRC who received salvage chemotherapy with TFTD (with/without Bev) followed by regorafenib (TFTD→Rego group/TFTD+Bev→Rego group), or reverse sequence (Rego→TFTD group) at the National Cancer Center Hospital between November 2013 and December 2020. The overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), disease control rate (DCR), tumor growth rate (TGR), and tumor growth kinetics (TGK) in the first evaluation were assessed in the three groups. Results A total of 69 patients, including 27 in the TFTD→Rego group, 13 in the TFTD+Bev→Rego group, and 29 in the Rego→TFTD group, were identified. There were no significant differences in the OS among the three groups, and in the PFS and DCR between the precedent and subsequent therapies in any of the groups. The median TGR (%/month) and TGK (mm/month) in the precedent→subsequent therapy were 50.9→32.7 (p = 0.044) and 8.76→7.79 in the TFTD→Rego group, 25.4→36.1 and 7.49→9.92 in the TFTD+Bev→Rego group, and 40.8→24.4 (p = 0.027) and 8.02→7.20 in the Rego→TFTD group, respectively. Conclusion In crossover use of TFTD with/without Bev and regorafenib, both agents showed similar efficacy in terms of the conventional parameters, but the differences observed in the TGR and TGK might suggest some influence of prior regorafenib treatment on the efficacy of subsequent TFTD therapy, and vice versa."
https://openalex.org/W4281762612,"Firearm violence remains a persistent public health threat. Comparing the impact of targeted high-risk versus population-based approaches to prevention may point to efficient and efficacious interventions. We used agent-based modeling to conduct a hypothetical experiment contrasting the impact of high-risk (disqualification) and population-based (price increase) approaches on firearm homicide in New York City (NYC).We simulated 800,000 agents reflecting a 15% sample of the adult population of NYC. Three groups were considered and disqualified from all firearm ownership for five years, grouped based on prevalence: low prevalence (psychiatric hospitalization, alcohol-related misdemeanor and felony convictions, 0.23%); moderate prevalence (drug misdemeanor convictions, domestic violence restraining orders, 1.03%); and high prevalence (all other felony/misdemeanor convictions, 2.30%). Population-level firearm ownership was impacted by increasing the price of firearms, assuming 1% price elasticity.In this hypothetical scenario, to reduce firearm homicide by 5% in NYC, 25% of the moderate prevalence group, or 12% of the high prevalence group needed to be effectively disqualified; even when all of the low prevalence group was disqualified, homicide did not decrease by 5%. An 18% increase in price similarly reduced firearm homicide by 5.37% (95% CI 4.43-6.31%). Firearm homicide declined monotonically as the proportion of disqualified individuals increased and/or price increased. A combined intervention that both increased price and effectively disqualified ""high-risk"" groups achieved approximately double the reduction in homicide as any one intervention alone. Increasing illegal firearm ownership by 20%, a hypothetical response to price increases, did not meaningfully change results.A key takeaway of our study is that adopting high-risk versus population-based approaches should not be an ""either-or"" question. When individual risk is variable and diffuse in the population, ""high-risk approaches"" to firearm violence need to focus on relatively prevalent groups and be highly efficacious in disarming people at elevated risk to achieve meaningful reductions in firearm homicide, though countering issues of social justice and stigma should be carefully considered. Similar reductions can be achieved with population-based approaches, such as price increases, albeit with fewer such countering issues."

https://openalex.org/W4281838670,"Taurine is an essential amino acid. It has been shown to be neuroprotective including protecting against the neurotoxic effects of glutamate. The goal of the current study was to examine the relationship between CB use and taurine measured in brain using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and peripherally from a urine sample. Two experiments are presented. The first is a reanalysis of published data that examined taurine and glutamate in the dorsal anterior cingulate of a CB user group and non-user group using MRS. The second experiment, in a separate CB user group, used metabolomics analysis to measure taurine levels in urine. Because body composition has been associated with the pharmacokinetics of cannabis and taurine levels, a moderation model was examined with body composition included as the covariate. The MRS study found taurine levels were correlated with glutamate in both groups and taurine was correlated with frequency of CB use in the CB user group. The moderation model demonstrated significant effects of CB use and BMI; the interaction was marginally significant with lower BMI individuals showing a positive relationship between CB use and taurine. A similar finding was observed for the urine analysis. Both CB use and weight, as well as the interaction were significant. In this case, individuals with higher weight showed an association between CB use and taurine levels. This study shows the feasibility and potential importance of examining the relationship between taurine and CB use as it may shed light on a mechanism that underlies the neuroprotective effects of CB."
https://openalex.org/W4281869914,"The aim of this study was to assess the risk of liver fibrosis in those with no glucose intolerance, prediabetes, or diabetes. A cross-sectional study was conducted based on a cohort from a health examination program which included a magnetic resonance elastography (MRE). Participants were classified into three groups according to glucose tolerance: no glucose intolerance, prediabetes, and diabetes mellitus. Liver fibrosis was evaluated by liver stiffness measurement (LSM) value using two-dimensional real-time MRE. The risk of significant liver fibrosis was compared among three groups. A total of 2,090 subjects were included: no glucose intolerance (n = 889); prediabetes (n = 985); and diabetes (n = 216). Mean values of LSM in those with no glucose intolerance, prediabetes, and diabetes were 2.37 ± 0.43 kPa, 2.41 ± 0.34 kPa, and 2.65 ± 0.70 kPa, respectively (p<0.001). Proportions of significant fibrosis (LSM ≥2.97 kPa) in no glucose intolerance, prediabetes, and diabetes groups were 3.1%, 4.4%, and 16.7%, respectively (p<0.001). Compared with those with no glucose intolerance, those with diabetes had higher risk of significant fibrosis (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 3.02, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.57-5.81, p<0.001). However, there was no difference between prediabetes and no glucose intolerance (aOR: 1.05, 95% CI: 0.59-1.86, p = 0.876). A subgroup analysis also showed that prediabetes, unlike diabetes, was not associated with significant fibrosis in subjects with or without liver disease. Diabetes, but not prediabetes, is a risk factor for significant liver fibrosis. This finding is consistent regarldess of the pressence of liver disease."

To better understand how these vulnerable and high-risk populations have experienced the pandemic, we conducted a qualitative study to better understand their experiences from diagnosis through recovery. Methods We conducted a qualitative study of patients in a North Carolina healthcare system’s registry who tested positive for COVID-19 from March 2020 through February 2021, identified from population-dense outbreaks of COVID-19 (hotspots). We conducted semi-structured phone interviews in English or Spanish, based on patient preference, with trained bilingual study personnel. Each interview was evaluated using a combination of deductive and inductive content analysis to determine prevalent themes related to COVID-19 knowledge, diagnosis, disease experience, and long-term impacts. Findings The 10 patients interviewed from our COVID-19 hotspot clusters were of equal distribution by sex, predominantly Black (70%), aged 22–70 years (IQR 45–62 years), and more frequently publicly insured (50% Medicaid/Medicare, vs 30% uninsured, vs 20% private insurance). Major themes identified included prior knowledge of COVID-19 and patient perceptions of their personal risk, the testing process in numerous settings, the process of quarantining at home after a positive diagnosis, the experience of receiving medical care during their illness, and difficulties with long-term recovery. Discussion Our findings suggest areas for targeted interventions to reduce COVID-19 transmission in these high-risk communities, as well as improve the patient experience throughout the COVID-19 illness course."
https://openalex.org/W4281725804,"The present study aimed to adapt the Attitudes and Beliefs about Sleepy Driving Scale (ABSDS) to a sample of Chinese drivers and to examine its reliability and validity.Five hundred and twenty drivers aged 18 to 56 years old were asked to complete the ABSDS and a validated Chinese version of the Prosocial and Aggressive Driving Inventory.The results showed that the final Chinese version of the ABSDS contained 7 items with satisfactory reliability. Second, significant gender differences were found in attitude towards sleepy driving, with female drivers scoring higher than male drivers. Third, significant correlations between ABSDS score and prosocial and aggressive driving behaviours were found. More importantly, ABSDS score can significantly predict drivers' prosocial driving behaviours. Moreover, ABSDS score can significantly predict drivers' violation involvement and accident involvement.The findings supported the psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the ABSDS and suggested that it can be used to assess drivers' attitudes and beliefs about sleepy driving in China."
https://openalex.org/W4281742353,"Homologous recombination repairs DNA breaks and sequence gaps via the production of joint DNA intermediates such as Holliday junctions. Dissolving Holliday junctions into linear DNA repair products requires the activity of the Sgs1 helicase in yeast and of its homologs in other organisms. Recent studies suggest that the functions of these conserved helicases are regulated by sumoylation; however, the mechanisms that promote their sumoylation are not well understood. Here, we employed in vitro sumoylation systems and cellular assays to determine the roles of DNA and the scaffold protein Esc2 in Sgs1 sumoylation. We show that DNA binding enhances Sgs1 sumoylation in vitro. In addition, we demonstrate the Esc2's midregion (MR) with DNA-binding activity is required for Sgs1 sumoylation. Unexpectedly, we found that the sumoylation-promoting effect of Esc2-MR is DNA independent, suggesting a second function for this domain. In agreement with our biochemical data, we found the Esc2-MR domain, like its SUMO E2-binding C-terminal domain characterized in previous studies, is required for proficient sumoylation of Sgs1 and its cofactors, Top3 and Rmi1, in cells. Taken together, these findings provide evidence that while DNA binding enhances Sgs1 sumoylation, Esc2-based stimulation of this modification is mediated by two distinct domains."
