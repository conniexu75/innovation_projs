https://openalex.org/W1971476169,"Measurements of erythrocytes within the blood are important clinical traits and can indicate various hematological disorders. We report here genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for six erythrocyte traits, including hemoglobin concentration (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and red blood cell count (RBC). We performed an initial GWAS in cohorts of the CHARGE Consortium totaling 24,167 individuals of European ancestry and replication in additional independent cohorts of the HaemGen Consortium totaling 9,456 individuals. We identified 23 loci significantly associated with these traits in a meta-analysis of the discovery and replication cohorts (combined P values ranging from 5 x 10(-8) to 7 x 10(-86)). Our findings include loci previously associated with these traits (HBS1L-MYB, HFE, TMPRSS6, TFR2, SPTA1) as well as new associations (EPO, TFRC, SH2B3 and 15 other loci). This study has identified new determinants of erythrocyte traits, offering insight into common variants underlying variation in erythrocyte measures."
https://openalex.org/W2078171783,"GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) is an incretin released from intestinal L-cells in response to food intake. Activation of the GLP-1 receptor potentiates the synthesis and release of insulin from pancreatic beta-cells in a glucose-dependent manner. The GLP-1 receptor belongs to class B of the G-protein-coupled receptors, a subfamily characterized by a large N-terminal extracellular ligand binding domain. Exendin-4 and GLP-1 are 50% identical, and exendin-4 is a full agonist with similar affinity and potency for the GLP-1 receptor. We recently solved the crystal structure of the GLP-1 receptor extracellular domain in complex with the competitive antagonist exendin-4(9-39). Interestingly, the isolated extracellular domain binds exendin-4 with much higher affinity than the endogenous agonist GLP-1. Here, we have solved the crystal structure of the extracellular domain in complex with GLP-1 to 2.1 Aresolution. The structure shows that important hydrophobic ligand-receptor interactions are conserved in agonist- and antagonist-bound forms of the extracellular domain, but certain residues in the ligand-binding site adopt a GLP-1-specific conformation. GLP-1 is a kinked but continuous alpha-helix from Thr(13) to Val(33) when bound to the extracellular domain. We supplemented the crystal structure with site-directed mutagenesis to link the structural information of the isolated extracellular domain with the binding properties of the full-length receptor. The data support the existence of differences in the binding modes of GLP-1 and exendin-4 on the full-length GLP-1 receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2089320547,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs that have recently emerged as important regulators of gene expression. They negatively regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally by translational repression and target mRNA degradation. miRNAs have been shown to play crucial roles in muscle development and in regulation of muscle cell proliferation and differentiation.By comparing miRNA expression profiling of proliferating myoblasts versus differentiated myotubes, a number of modulated miRNAs, not previously implicated in regulation of myogenic differentiation, were identified. Among these, miR-221 and miR-222 were strongly down-regulated upon differentiation of both primary and established myogenic cells. Conversely, miR-221 and miR-222 expression was restored in post-mitotic, terminally differentiated myotubes subjected to Src tyrosine kinase activation. By the use of specific inhibitors we provide evidence that expression of miR-221 and miR-222 is under the control of the Ras-MAPK pathway. Both in myoblasts and in myotubes, levels of the cell cycle inhibitor p27 inversely correlated with miR-221 and miR-222 expression, and indeed we show that p27 mRNA is a direct target of these miRNAs in myogenic cells. Ectopic expression of miR-221 and miR-222 in myoblasts undergoing differentiation induced a delay in withdrawal from the cell cycle and in myogenin expression, followed by inhibition of sarcomeric protein accumulation. When miR-221 and miR-222 were expressed in myotubes undergoing maturation, a profound alteration of myofibrillar organization was observed.miR-221 and miR-222 have been found to be modulated during myogenesis and to play a role both in the progression from myoblasts to myocytes and in the achievement of the fully differentiated phenotype. Identification of miRNAs modulating muscle gene expression is crucial for the understanding of the circuits controlling skeletal muscle differentiation and maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W1996045802,"Bioactive compounds reported to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis are linked to many health benefits such increased longevity, improved energy utilization, and protection from reactive oxygen species. Previously studies have shown that mice and rats fed diets lacking in pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) have reduced mitochondrial content. Therefore, we hypothesized that PQQ can induce mitochondrial biogenesis in mouse hepatocytes. Exposure of mouse Hepa1–6 cells to 10–30 μm PQQ for 24–48 h resulted in increased citrate synthase and cytochrome c oxidase activity, Mitotracker staining, mitochondrial DNA content, and cellular oxygen respiration. The induction of this process occurred through the activation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), a pathway known to regulate mitochondrial biogenesis. PQQ exposure stimulated phosphorylation of CREB at serine 133, activated the promoter of PGC-1α, and increased PGC-1α mRNA and protein expression. PQQ did not stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis after small interfering RNA-mediated reduction in either PGC-1α or CREB expression. Consistent with activation of the PGC-1α pathway, PQQ increased nuclear respiratory factor activation (NRF-1 and NRF-2) and Tfam, TFB1M, and TFB2M mRNA expression. Moreover, PQQ protected cells from mitochondrial inhibition by rotenone, 3-nitropropionic acid, antimycin A, and sodium azide. The ability of PQQ to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis accounts in part for action of this compound and suggests that PQQ may be beneficial in diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction.

Furthermore, mitochondrial DNA depletion and mutations are associated with cardiomyopathy, lactic acidosis, developmental delay, failure to thrive, and impaired neurological function (9Debray F.G. Lambert M. Mitchell G.A. Curr. Opin. Pediatr. 2008; 20: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The response to most biofactors is observed after pharmacological intervention or dietary supplementation, although often near-gram amounts per kg of diet, or millimolar quantities, are needed for such responses in vivo. PQQ stimulates mitochondriogenesis with the addition of only milligram quantities of PQQ per kg of diet, or micromolar concentrations, in vivo. For example, PQQ deprivation depresses mitochondrial function, which is reversed when as little as 200–300 μg of PQQ/kg of diet are added (1Stites T. Storms D. Bauerly K. Mah J. Harris C. Fascetti A.

PQQ also remains detectable in tissues when there is no or little dietary exposure (11Steinberg F. Stites T.E. Anderson P. Storms D. Chan I. Eghbali S. Rucker R. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), which has not been observed for other dietary polyphenolic compounds known to promote mitochondriogenesis. pyrroloquinoline quinone cAMP response element (CRE)-binding protein peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α small interfering RNA reactive oxygen species imidazopyrroloquinoline carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone phosphate buffer saline Hanks' balanced salt solution Dulbecco's minimal essential medium nuclear respiratory factor analysis of variance 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide. Recently, PQQ produced by rhizobacterium has been identified as an important plant growth factor (12Choi O. Kim J. Kim J.G. Jeong Y. Moon J.S. Park C.S. Hwang I. Plant Physiol. 2008; 146: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and is a possible source of PQQ in plant-derived food. In this regard, the ubiquitous presence of PQQ in a broad range of plants leads to a relatively constant exposure in animal diets. More importantly, levels of PQQ from dietary intake from plants are sufficient to maintain the concentration of PQQ typical of tissues (13Kumazawa T. Sato K. Seno H. Ishii A. Suzuki O. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 331-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). From a chemical perspective, assays that measure redox cycling indicate that PQQ is also 100–1000 times more efficient than other quinones and enediols, such as ascorbic acid (14Stites T.E. Mitchell A.E. Rucker R.B. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 719-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). PQQ can undergo thousands of reductive or oxidative cycles without degradation or polymerization (14Stites T.E. Mitchell A.E. Rucker R.B. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 719-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1 α (PGC-1α) is a transcriptional coactivator that induces mitochondrial biogenesis by binding to nuclear respiratory factors and enhancing their activity (15Gleyzer N. Vercauteren K. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1354-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Nuclear respiratory factors are transcription factors that bind to cis-acting response elements in the promoter regions of many genes that control mitochondrial gene transcription and mitochondrial DNA replication (15Gleyzer N. Vercauteren K. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1354-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). PGC-1α is also associated with a reduction in reactive oxygen species (ROS) (16St.-Pierre J. Drori S. Uldry M. Silvaggi J.M. Rhee J. Jäger S. Handschin C. Zheng K. Lin J. Yang W. Simon D.K. Bachoo R.

Moreover, the phosphorylation of CREB is known to be an important regulator of PGC-1α (18Handschin C. Rhee J. Lin J. Tarr P.T. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 7111-7116Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). The function of PQQ in mammalian physiology remains controversial. PQQ has been proposed as a vitamin (19Kasahara T. Kato T. Nature. 2003; 422: 832Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), but it has not been demonstrated that PQQ serves as an enzyme cofactor in mammalian tissues (20Felton L.M. Anthony C. Nature. 2005; 433: E10-E12Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 21Rucker R. Storms D. Sheets A. Tchaparian E. Fascetti A. Nature. 2005; 433: E10-E12Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Upon appreciation that mitochondrial content can be influenced by PQQ nutritional status and that reported beneficial effects of PQQ may be directly related to mitochondrial function, we hypothesized that PQQ may induce mitochondrial biogenesis through a mitochondrial-related cell signaling mechanism. Given that many mitochondrial-related events are regulated by PGC-1α and nuclear respiratory factors (15Gleyzer N. Vercauteren K. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1354-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that PQQ may interact with a PGC-1α-related pathway. We used the mouse Hepa1–6 hepatocyte cell line as a model to investigate these hypotheses. We also explored whether PQQ may protect against the toxic effects of mitochondrial electron transport chain inhibition. Mitsubishi Gas and Chemical provided PQQ as a gift. Imidazopyrroloquinoline (IPQ) was produced by incubating PQQ with glycine as described previously (22Mitchell A.E. Jones A.D. Mercer R.S. Rucker R.B. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) followed by separation using a PD-10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences) and lyophilization. Bovine catalase and bovine copper/zinc superoxide dismutase were purchased from Worthington Biochemical and Sigma, respectively. The mitochondrial toxins (rotenone, 3-nitropropionic acid, antimycin A, and sodium azide) that inhibit separate portions of the electron transport chain (Complexes I-IV) and carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP), used to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation, were obtained from Sigma. Hepa1–6 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Basal culturing medium contained Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM) with 4.5 g of d-glucose/liter media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/liter penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen). The NRF-1 reporter plasmid (Panomics, Fremont, CA) contains four tandem repeats of the NRF-1 response element (5′- TGCGCACGCGCG-3′) within the pTranslucent plasmid, which contains a thymidine kinase minimal promoter and luciferase reporter gene downstream of the NRF-1 response element. The NRF-2 and CREB reporter plasmids were created by first digesting the NRF-1 reporter plasmid with KpnI and NheI to excise the insert. The insert was replaced by ligating annealed oligonucleotides (see supplemental Table 1; the response element in the sense strand is underlined) containing three tandem repeats of the NRF-2 response element from the mouse Tfam promoter (23Rantanen A. Jansson M. Oldfors A. Larsson N.G. Mamm. Genome. 2001; 12: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 24Choi Y.S. Lee H.K. Pak Y.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1574: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) or four tandem repeats of the cAMP response element present in the PGC-1α promoter (18Handschin C. Rhee J. Lin J. Tarr P.T. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 7111-7116Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar) to the modified reporter plasmid. The pTranslucent plasmid lacking any enhancer sequence was used as a control plasmid (Panomics). The PGC-1α promoter reporter plasmids (18Handschin C. Rhee J. Lin J. Tarr P.T. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 7111-7116Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), containing a 2.6-kb portion of 5′-flanking sequence of mouse PGC-1α gene between −2533 and +78 relative to the transcriptional start site, with and without an intact CRE site was provided as a generous gift from Dr. Bruce Spiegalman through the Addgene plasmid depository (Addgene plasmids 8887 and 8888). A plasmid lacking the promoter region (pGL3-Basic, Promega) was used as a control. Cells (1 × 105 cells/well) were plated in 12-well plates and transfected the next day with 0.8 μg of reporter plasmid DNA (NRF-1, NRF-2, CREB, or PGC-1α) and 0.8 μg of β-galactosidase expression vector (pCMVβ, Clontech) per well using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cell media containing DMEM plus fetal bovine serum were replaced in all wells 5 h post-transfection. Cells were then incubated for 24 h with phenol red-free cell media containing either unsupplemented media (control) or media containing 15 or 30 μm PQQ 12 h post-transfection. Cells were washed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS), and cells were lysed with reporter lysis buffer (Promega) and a single freeze-thaw cycle. Luciferase activity was determined using the Luciferase assay system (Promega) and analyzed using a luminometer (Turner 20/20, Turner Biosystems). β-Galactosidase activity was determined using the β-galactosidase enzyme assay system (Promega) and analyzed using a spectrophotometric microplate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences HTS 7000 Plus or Labsystems Multiskan Ascent). Response element or promoter activation was determined as a ratio of luciferase activity to β-galactosidase activity. Cells (3 × 106 cells/plate) were plated into 10-cm plates. Twenty-four hours later cells were incubated with either control DMEM or media supplemented with PQQ for 24 h. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and scraped into ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA. 250 mm sucrose) containing protease inhibitors (Sigma) and sonicated twice for 10 s on ice. SDS was added after sonication to a final concentration of 0.025%, and protein concentration in the resulting cell lysate was determined by Bradford assay. The resulting protein lysate was resuspended in SDS sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol. Total cell lysate (10 μg/well) was separated by SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad Ready Gels) under reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C in 5% nonfat milk in PBST (PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated with PBST with rabbit anti-PGC-1α (0.2 μg/ml; Santa Cruz) for 1 h followed by donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:20,000 in PBST; Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h or mouse anti-β-actin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (3.3 ng/ml; Santa Cruz) antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Bands were visualized by chemiluminescence (SuperSignal Femto, Pierce; Western blotting Luminol reagent, Santa Cruz) followed by autoradiography and quantified by densitometry (Quantity One, Bio-Rad). Cell protein was isolated as described above but in the presence of both phosphatase inhibitors (Phosphatase inhibitor mixture P2850, Sigma) and protease inhibitors (Protease inhibitor mixture P2714, Sigma). CREB phosphorylation at serine 133 and total CREB protein were detected by immunoblotting using phosphoserine-133-CREB and total CREB antibodies, respectively (Cell Signaling), as described above, except that Tris-buffered saline replaced phosphate-buffered saline, and bovine serum albumin (Fraction V, Sigma) replaced nonfat milk. The amount of phosphorylated CREB was determined by the amount of CREB detected by the phosphoserine-specific antibody and quantified by densitometry divided by the amount of CREB detected by the total CREB antibody. Cells (1 × 106 cells/plate) were plated in 10-cm plates. Twenty-four hours later cells were incubated in PQQ supplemented media for 48 h, and cell protein was isolated as described above, except that cells were homogenized with 12 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer, and SDS was omitted. Cytochrome c oxidase activity was assessed as described previously (10Bauerly K.A. Storms D.H. Harris C.B. Hajizadeh S. Sun M.Y. Cheung C.P. Satre M.A. Fascetti A.J. Tchaparian E. Rucker R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1760: 1741-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Cells (5 × 105 cells/well) were plated in 24-well plates. Twenty-four hours later cells were incubated in PQQ-supplemented media for 24 or 48 h, and cell protein was isolated using CelLytic M cell lysis reagent (Sigma) and frozen at −80 °C until assayed. Citrate synthase activity in 10 μg of cell protein (measured by Bradford assay) was assessed using the citrate synthase assay kit (Sigma) according to manufacturer instructions, and changes in absorbance were measured using a microplate reader. Activity was expressed relative to control condition. Mitochondria were detected by Mitotracker Green FM staining (Invitrogen). Cells were plated in 96-well plates (1 × 104 cells/well) for the microplate assay or 6-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well) for flow cytometry. After 24 h cells were incubated with PQQ-supplemented media (or control) for 24 or 48 h (only 48 h for flow cytometry). Cells were washed with serum-free DMEM and stained with 100 nm (for flow cytometry) or 200 nm (for the microplate assay) Mitotracker Green FM for 30 min. The unstained control samples were incubated with serum-free DMEM containing no dye but an equivalent concentration of DMSO as the stained sample. After staining, cells were washed three times with serum-free DMEM. For microplate assay, staining was detected on a fluorescence microplate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences Wallac Victor2, excitation 485 nm, emission 520 nm), and fluorescence was subtracted from the unstained control and expressed relative to cell number. Stained (and unstained control) cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences) followed by analysis of median fluorescence intensity of 20,000 events by Cellquest software (BD Biosciences). Cells (2 × 105 cells/well) were plated in 6-well plates. Twenty-four hours later cells were incubated in control or PQQ-supplemented media for 48 h. Genomic DNA (containing both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA) was isolated from cells (QIAamp DNA mini kit, Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions. Mitochondrial DNA (0.1 ng) and nuclear DNA (10 ng) were amplified by quantitative real-time PCR as described previously (1Stites T. Storms D. Bauerly K. Mah J. Harris C. Fascetti A. Rogers Q. Tchaparian E. Satre M. Rucker R.B. J. Nutr. 2006; 136: 390-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Cells (4 × 105 cells/well) were plated in 6-well plates. Twenty-four hours later cells were incubated in control or PQQ-supplemented media for 24 h, and total RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and diluted to 1 μg/μl in RNase-free water. cDNA was generated from 1 μg of RNA by reverse transcription (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) performed at 48 °C for 30 min followed by 95 °C for 5 min. Primers for mouse PGC-1α, Tfam, TFB1M, TFB2M, and β-actin (see supplemental Table 2) were designed by Primer Express (Applied Biosystems). Relative gene expression was determined by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR as described previously (10Bauerly K.A. Storms D.H. Harris C.B. Hajizadeh S. Sun M.Y. Cheung C.P. Satre M.A. Fascetti A.J. Tchaparian E. Rucker R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1760: 1741-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) but expressed relative to β-actin. Cellular oxygen consumption was measured using the BD Oxygen Biosensor system (BD Biosciences). Cells were plated in 6-well plates at 30% confluency, and after 24 h cells incubated in control media or media supplemented with 30 μm PQQ for 24 h or 48 h. Oxygen consumption was then measured as described below, or cells were then exposed to control media containing 0.004% DMSO or media containing 0.2 μm rotenone (dissolved in DMSO) for 24 h. Cells were dissociated from the plates with trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen). Cells (5 × 105) were then pipetted into each well. Cells were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 1 h, then changes in oxygen concentration in the media was measured using a fluorescence microplate reader (excitation 485 nm, emission 620 nm, heated to 37 °C). Cells were incubated with 1 μm rotenone immediately after plating or 5 μm FCCP just before reading on the microplate reader. DMSO (0.05% diluted in cell media) was included as a control immediately after plating cells into assay plate because both rotenone and FCCP are dissolved in DMSO. Oxygen consumption was expressed as the difference in relative fluorescence units at 10 and 20 min after the start of the assay, relative to the control condition. Cells (1 × 104 cells/well) were plated in 96-well plates and 24 h later incubated in 30 μm PQQ-supplemented or control media for 24 h, then incubated in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing 20 μm rotenone (dissolved in 0.25% DMSO) or control HBSS (containing DMSO) for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed 3 times with HBSS and incubated with 10 μm MitoSOX (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed 3 times with HBSS, and mitochondrial superoxide was detected using a fluorescence microplate reader (excitation 485 nm, emission 590 nm, heated to 37 °C). Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 and PGC-1α-specific siRNA (sense, 5′-AAGACGGAUUGCCCUCAUUUGtt-3′; antisense, 5′-CAAAUGAGGGCAAUCCGUCUUtt-3′) or control siRNA (sense, 5′-AAGCUUCAUAAGGCGCAUAGCtt-3′; antisense, 5′-GCUAUGCGCCUUAUGAAGCUUtt-3′), as previously designed by Zhang et al.

This region of the PGC-1α nucleotide sequence is conserved in both mice and rats. Transfection and efficacy of siRNA was confirmed by immunoblotting after transfection of PGC-1α-specific or CREB specific and control siRNA as described above. After transfection (24 h post-transfection), cells were incubated with control or PQQ-supplemented media for 48 h, then citrate synthase activity, Mitotracker staining, and mitochondrial DNA content were assessed as described above. PQQ (2–250 μm for superoxide, 2–50 μm for hydrogen peroxide) was added to control cell media containing 10% fetal bovine serum (without cells) and incubated for 0–24 h (0–6 h for hydrogen peroxide). Superoxide generated by PQQ was measured by luminol oxidation assay (Sigma) on a microplate reader. Hydrogen peroxide generated by PQQ was measured by a xylenol orange-iron oxidation assay (Pierce) on a microplate reader. The effects of PQQ on citrate synthase activity, Mitotracker microplate staining, cellular oxygen consumption, NRF-1, NRF-2, CREB, and PGC-1α promoter activation and cell viability after toxin exposure were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey post-test. The effects of PQQ on mitochondrial DNA content, cytochrome c oxidase activity, Tfam, TFB1M, and TFB2M mRNA expression and PGC-1α mRNA and protein expression were analyzed by Student's t test. The effects of PQQ and rotenone on cellular oxygen consumption and superoxide generation were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey post-test. The effect of PGC-1α and CREB siRNA knockdown on PGC-1α and CREB (for CREB siRNA only) protein expression was analyzed by Student's t test. The effects of PQQ after PGC-1α and CREB siRNA knockdown on citrate synthase activity, Mitotracker staining, and mitochondrial DNA content were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey post-test (and two-way ANOVA where indicated). The effect of PQQ on superoxide and hydrogen peroxide generation (and catalase) in media was analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey post-test. The effect of PQQ and catalase or superoxide dismutase and IPQ on citrate synthase activity, Mitotracker staining, and mitochondrial DNA content was analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey post-test. Significant differences of mean values were established at p < 0.05. Unless noted otherwise, statistics reflect intraexperimental variability. The succinate dehydrogenase activity assay is described in the supplemental methods. Citrate synthase activity was increased in Hepa1–6 cells exposed to PQQ for 24 or 48 h (Fig. 1A). Cytochrome c oxidase activity was increased in cells exposed to PQQ for 48 h (Fig. 1B). PQQ treatment increased mitochondrial content, as assessed by Mitotracker microplate assay (Fig. 1C) and confirmed by flow cytometry (Fig. 1, D–H). Consistent with an increase in mitochondrial enzyme content, mitochondrial DNA relative to nuclear DNA was also increased in cells after PQQ exposure (Fig. 1I). As additional validation, PQQ exposure for 24 or 48 h leads to increased cellular oxygen consumption (Fig. 1J). Because nuclear respiratory factors are known to be key regulators of mitochondrial function (27Scarpulla R.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 97: 673-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), we investigated whether PQQ exposure leads to increased activation of these transcription factors. Cells transfected with a reporter plasmid containing response elements for either NRF-1 or NRF-2 displayed increased activation after PQQ exposure (Fig. 2A), which suggests that PQQ induces the activation of these transcription factors. PQQ also led to increased Tfam, TFB1M, and TFB2M mRNA expression (Fig. 2B). These genes contain response elements for both NRF-1 and NRF-2 (15Gleyzer N. Vercauteren K. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1354-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) and are linked to mitochondrial transcription and replication (27Scarpulla R.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 97: 673-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), which suggests that PQQ can activate NRF-1 and NRF-2 activity and related genes and may induce mitochondrial biogenesis. PGC-1α binding can directly regulate NRF-1 and NRF-2 activity (28Wu Z. Puigserver P. Andersson U. Zhang C. Adelmant G. Mootha V. Troy A. Cinti S. Lowell B. Scarpulla R.C. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3148) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we investigated whether PQQ can regulate PGC-1α. PQQ exposure for 24 h led to an increase in both PGC-1α mRNA (Fig. 3A) and protein (Fig. 3B). PQQ exposure also led to increased PGC-1α promoter activation but only if a CRE site is retained. No activation of the promoter by PQQ was observed in transfected cells when the CRE site has been mutated (Fig. 3C), which suggested that the CRE site in important for PQQ-induced PGC-1α activation, possibly due to CREB (CRE-binding protein). PGC-1α is required for the induction of mitochondrial biogenesis by PQQ. Transfection with PGC-1α-specific siRNA reduced PGC-1α protein expression (Fig. 4, A and B) and concomitantly failed to induce mitochondrial biogenesis by PQQ, as measured by citrate synthase activity (Fig. 4C), Mitotracker staining (Fig. 4D) and mitochondrial DNA content (Fig. 4E) compared with the PQQ-induced mitochondrial genesis in cells transfected with the control siRNA.

In this study, we attempt to analyze the independent and joint effect of variants from these loci on type 2 diabetes and clinical phenotypes related to glucose metabolism.Twenty-one single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from fourteen loci were successfully genotyped in 1,849 subjects with type 2 diabetes and 1,785 subjects with normal glucose regulation. We analyzed the allele and genotype distribution between the cases and controls of these SNPs as well as the joint effects of the susceptible loci on type 2 diabetes risk. The associations between SNPs and type 2 diabetes were examined by logistic regression. The associations between SNPs and quantitative traits were examined by linear regression. The discriminative accuracy of the prediction models was assessed by area under the receiver operating characteristic curves. We confirmed the effects of SNPs from PPARG, KCNJ11, CDKAL1, CDKN2A-CDKN2B, IDE-KIF11-HHEX, IGF2BP2 and SLC30A8 on risk for type 2 diabetes, with odds ratios ranging from 1.114 to 1.406 (P value range from 0.0335 to 1.37E-12). But no significant association was detected between SNPs from WFS1, FTO, JAZF1, TSPAN8-LGR5, THADA, ADAMTS9, NOTCH2-ADAM30 and type 2 diabetes. Analyses on the quantitative traits in the control subjects showed that THADA SNP rs7578597 was association with 2-h insulin during oral glucose tolerance tests (P = 0.0005, empirical P = 0.0090). The joint effect analysis of SNPs from eleven loci showed the individual carrying more risk alleles had a significantly higher risk for type 2 diabetes. And the type 2 diabetes patients with more risk allele tended to have earlier diagnostic ages (P = 0.0006).The current study confirmed the association between PPARG, KCNJ11, CDKAL1, CDKN2A-CDKN2B, IDE-KIF11-HHEX, IGF2BP2 and SLC30A8 and type 2 diabetes. These type 2 diabetes risk loci contributed to the disease additively."
https://openalex.org/W1989917351,"It is generally believed that the miRNA processing machinery ensures the generation of a mature miRNA with a fixed sequence, particularly at its 5' end. However, we and others have recently noted that the ends of a given mature miRNA are not absolutely fixed, but subject to variation. Neither the significance nor the mechanism behind the generation of such miRNA polymorphism is understood. miR-142 is an abundantly expressed miRNA in hematopoietic cells and exhibits a high frequency of 5' end polymorphism.Here we show that a shift in the Drosha processing of pri-miRNA generates multiple forms of miR-142s in vivo with differing 5' ends that might target different genes. Sequence analysis of several pre-miRNA ends cloned from T cells reveals that unlike many other pri-miRNAs that are processed into a single pre-miRNA, pri-miR-142 is processed into 3 distinct pre-miR-142s. Dicer processing studies suggest that each of the 3 pre-miR-142s is processed into a distinct double-stranded miRNA, giving rise to 4 mature miRNA variants that might regulate different target gene pools.Thus, alternative Drosha processing might be a novel mechanism for diversification of the miRNA target gene pool."
https://openalex.org/W2012580167,"NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR), a diflavin reductase, plays a key role in the mammalian P450 mono-oxygenase system. In its crystal structure, the two flavins are close together, positioned for interflavin electron transfer but not for electron transfer to cytochrome P450. A number of lines of evidence suggest that domain motion is important in the action of the enzyme. We report NMR and small-angle x-ray scattering experiments addressing directly the question of domain organization in human CPR. Comparison of the (1)H-(15)N heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectrum of CPR with that of the isolated FMN domain permitted identification of residues in the FMN domain whose environment differs in the two situations. These include several residues that are solvent-exposed in the CPR crystal structure, indicating the existence of a second conformation in which the FMN domain is involved in a different interdomain interface. Small-angle x-ray scattering experiments showed that oxidized and NADPH-reduced CPRs have different overall shapes. The scattering curve of the reduced enzyme can be adequately explained by the crystal structure, whereas analysis of the data for the oxidized enzyme indicates that it exists as a mixture of approximately equal amounts of two conformations, one consistent with the crystal structure and one a more extended structure consistent with that inferred from the NMR data. The correlation between the effects of adenosine 2',5'-bisphosphate and NADPH on the scattering curve and their effects on the rate of interflavin electron transfer suggests that this conformational equilibrium is physiologically relevant."
https://openalex.org/W2118688587,"During atherogenesis and vascular inflammation quiescent platelets are activated to increase the surface expression and ligand affinity of the integrin alphaIIbbeta3 via inside-out signaling. Diverse signals such as thrombin, ADP and epinephrine transduce signals through their respective GPCRs to activate protein kinases that ultimately lead to the phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tail of the integrin alphaIIbbeta3 and augment its function. The signaling pathways that transmit signals from the GPCR to the cytosolic domain of the integrin are not well defined. In an effort to better understand these pathways, we employed a combination of proteomic profiling and computational analyses of isolated human platelets. We analyzed ten independent human samples and identified a total of 1507 unique proteins in platelets. This is the most comprehensive platelet proteome assembled to date and includes 190 membrane-associated and 262 phosphorylated proteins, which were identified via independent proteomic and phospho-proteomic profiling. We used this proteomic dataset to create a platelet protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and applied novel contextual information about the phosphorylation step to introduce limited directionality in the PPI graph. This newly developed contextual PPI network computationally recapitulated an integrin signaling pathway. Most importantly, our approach not only provided insights into the mechanism of integrin alphaIIbbeta3 activation in resting platelets but also provides an improved model for analysis and discovery of PPI dynamics and signaling pathways in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2038253580,"Upon activation by therapeutics, the nuclear xenobiotic/ constitutive active/androstane receptor (CAR) regulates various liver functions ranging from drug metabolism and excretion to energy metabolism. CAR can also be a risk factor for developing liver diseases such as hepatocellular carcinoma. Here we have characterized the conserved threonine 38 of human CAR as the primary residue that regulates nuclear translocation and activation of CAR. Protein kinase C phosphorylates threonine 38 located on the alpha-helix spanning from residues 29-42 that constitutes a part of the first zinc finger and continues into the region between the zinc fingers. Molecular dynamics study has revealed that this phosphorylation may destabilize this helix, thereby inactivating CAR binding to DNA as well as sequestering it in the cytoplasm. We have found, in fact, that helix-stabilizing mutations reversed the effects of phosphorylation. Immunohistochemical study using an anti-phospho-threonine 38 peptide antibody has, in fact, demonstrated that the classic CAR activator phenobarbital dephosphorylates the corresponding threonine 48 of mouse CAR in the cytoplasm of mouse liver and translocates CAR into the nucleus. These results define CAR as a cell signal-regulated constitutive active nuclear receptor. These results also provide phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the threonine as the primary drug target for CAR activation."
https://openalex.org/W2094698530,"Extended neoteny and late stage allometric growth increase morphological disparity between growth stages in at least some dinosaurs. Coupled with relatively low dinosaur density in the Upper Cretaceous of North America, ontogenetic transformational representatives are often difficult to distinguish. For example, many hadrosaurids previously reported to represent relatively small lambeosaurine species were demonstrated to be juveniles of the larger taxa. Marginocephalians (pachycephalosaurids + ceratopsids) undergo comparable and extreme cranial morphological change during ontogeny.Cranial histology, morphology and computer tomography reveal patterns of internal skull development that show the purported diagnostic characters for the pachycephalosaurids Dracorex hogwartsia and Stygimoloch spinifer are ontogenetically derived features. Coronal histological sections of the frontoparietal dome of an adult Pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis reveal a dense structure composed of metaplastic bone with a variety of extremely fibrous and acellular tissue. Coronal histological sections and computer tomography of a skull and frontoparietal dome of Stygimoloch spinifer reveal an open intrafrontal suture indicative of a subadult stage of development. These dinosaurs employed metaplasia to rapidly grow and change the size and shape of their horns, cranial ornaments and frontoparietal domes, resulting in extreme cranial alterations during late stages of growth. We propose that Dracorex hogwartsia, Stygimoloch spinifer and Pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis are the same taxon and represent an ontogenetic series united by shared morphology and increasing skull length.Dracorex hogwartsia (juvenile) and Stygimoloch spinifer (subadult) are reinterpreted as younger growth stages of Pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis (adult). This synonymy reduces the number of pachycephalosaurid taxa from the Upper Cretaceous of North America and demonstrates the importance of cranial ontogeny in evaluating dinosaur diversity and taxonomy. These growth stages reflect a continuum rather than specific developmental steps defined by ""known"" terminal morphologies."

We now demonstrate accumulation of the D-form of complex I in human epithelial kidney cells after prolonged hypoxia. Upon reoxygenation after hypoxia there was an initial delay in the return of the respiration rate to normal. This was due to the accumulation of the D-form and its slow, substrate-dependent reconversion to the A-form. Reconversion to the A-form could be prevented by prolonged incubation with endogenously generated NO. We propose that the hypoxic transition from the A-form to the D-form of complex I may be protective, because it would act to reduce the electron burst and the formation of free radicals during reoxygenation. However, this may become an early pathophysiological event when NO-dependent formation of S-nitrosothiols or peroxynitrite structurally modifies complex I in its D-form and impedes its return to the active state.

https://openalex.org/W2062485102,"Tissue morphogenesis and organogenesis require that cells retain stable cell-cell adhesion while changing shape and moving. One mechanism to accommodate this plasticity in cell adhesion involves regulated trafficking of junctional proteins.Here we explored trafficking of junctional proteins in two well-characterized model epithelia, the Drosophila embryonic ectoderm and amnioserosa. We find that DE-cadherin, the transmembrane protein of adherens junctions, is actively trafficked through putative vesicles, and appears to travel through both Rab5-positive and Rab11-positive structures. We manipulated the functions of Rab11 and Rab5 to examine the effects on junctional stability and morphogenesis. Reducing Rab11 function, either using a dominant negative construct or loss of function alleles, disrupts integrity of the ectoderm and leads to loss of adherens junctions. Strikingly, the apical junctional regulator Crumbs is lost before AJs are destabilized, while the basolateral protein Dlg remains cortical. Altering Rab5 function had less dramatic effects, not disrupting adherens junction integrity but affecting dorsal closure.We contrast our results with what others saw when disrupting other trafficking regulators, and when disrupting Rab function in other tissues; together these data suggest distinct mechanisms regulate junctional stability and plasticity in different tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2022822628,"Antibodies, particularly cytophilic IgG subclasses, with specificity for asexual blood stage antigens of Plasmodium falciparum, are thought to play an important role in acquired immunity to malaria. Evaluating such responses in longitudinal sero-epidemiological field studies, allied to increasing knowledge of the immunological mechanisms associated with anti-malarial protection, will help in the development of malaria vaccines.We conducted a 1-year follow-up study of 305 Senegalese children and identified those resistant or susceptible to malaria. In retrospective analyses we then compared post-follow-up IgG responses to six asexual-stage candidate malaria vaccine antigens in groups of individuals with clearly defined clinical and parasitological histories of infection with P. falciparum. In age-adjusted analyses, children resistant to malaria as well as to high-density parasitemia, had significantly higher IgG1 responses to GLURP and IgG3 responses to MSP2 than their susceptible counterparts. Among those resistant to malaria, high anti-MSP1 IgG1 levels were associated with protection against high-density parasitemia. To assess functional attributes, we used an in vitro parasite growth inhibition assay with purified IgG. Samples from individuals with high levels of IgG directed to MSP1, MSP2 and AMA1 gave the strongest parasite growth inhibition, but a marked age-related decline was observed in these effects.Our data are consistent with the idea that protection against P. falciparum malaria in children depends on acquisition of a constellation of appropriate, functionally active IgG subclass responses directed to multiple asexual stage antigens. Our results suggest at least two distinct mechanisms via which antibodies may exert protective effects. Although declining with age, the growth inhibitory effects of purified IgG measurable in vitro reflected levels of anti-AMA1, -MSP1 and -MSP2, but not of anti-GLURP IgG. The latter could act on parasite growth via indirect parasiticidal pathways."

https://openalex.org/W1991434038,"Mechanistic details of mammalian metabolism in vivo and dynamic metabolic changes in intact organisms are difficult to monitor because of the lack of spatial, chemical, or temporal resolution when applying traditional analytical tools. These limitations can be addressed by sensitivity enhancement technology for fast in vivo NMR assays of enzymatic fluxes in tissues of interest. We apply this methodology to characterize organ-specific short chain fatty acid metabolism and the changes of carnitine and coenzyme A pools in ischemia reperfusion. This is achieved by assaying acetyl-CoA synthetase and acetyl-carnitine transferase catalyzed transformations in vivo. The fast and predominant flux of acetate and propionate signal into acyl-carnitine pools shows the efficient buffering of free CoA levels. Sizeable acetyl-carnitine formation from exogenous acetate is even found in liver, where acetyl-CoA synthetase and acetyl-carnitine transferase activities have been assumed sequestered in different compartments. In vivo assays of altered acetate metabolism were applied to characterize pathological changes of acetate metabolism upon ischemia. Coenzyme pools in ischemic skeletal muscle are reduced in vivo even 1 h after disturbing muscle perfusion. Impaired mitochondrial metabolism and slow restoration of free CoA are corroborated by assays employing fumarate to show persistently reduced tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity upon ischemia. In the same animal model, anaerobic metabolism of pyruvate and tissue perfusion normalize faster than mitochondrial bioenergetics."

We demonstrate that intracellular heme is the physiologically relevant mediator of the cytotoxic effects of artemisinins. Increasing intracellular heme synthesis through the addition of aminolevulinic acid, protoporphyrin IX, or transferrin-bound iron increased the cytotoxicity of dihydroartemisinin, while decreasing heme synthesis through the addition of succinyl acetone decreased its cytotoxic activity. A simple and robust high throughput assay was developed to screen chemical compounds that were capable of interacting with heme. A natural products library was screened which identified the compound coralyne, in addition to artemisinin, as a heme interacting compound with heme synthesis dependent cytotoxic activity. These results indicate that cellular heme may serve a general target for the development of both anti-parasitic and anti-cancer therapeutics."

https://openalex.org/W2138678825,"When searching for prey, animals should maximize energetic gain, while minimizing energy expenditure by altering their movements relative to prey availability. However, with increasing amounts of marine debris, what once may have been 'optimal' foraging strategies for top marine predators, are leading to sub-optimal diets comprised in large part of plastic. Indeed, the highly vagile Laysan albatross (Phoebastria immutabilis) which forages throughout the North Pacific, are well known for their tendency to ingest plastic. Here we examine whether Laysan albatrosses nesting on Kure Atoll and Oahu Island, 2,150 km apart, experience different levels of plastic ingestion. Twenty two geolocators were deployed on breeding adults for up to two years. Regurgitated boluses of undigestable material were also collected from chicks at each site to compare the amount of plastic vs. natural foods. Chicks from Kure Atoll were fed almost ten times the amount of plastic compared to chicks from Oahu despite boluses from both colonies having similar amounts of natural food. Tracking data indicated that adults from either colony did not have core overlapping distributions during the early half of the breeding period and that adults from Kure had a greater overlap with the putative range of the Western Garbage Patch corroborating our observation of higher plastic loads at this colony. At-sea distributions also varied throughout the year suggesting that Laysan albatrosses either adjusted their foraging behavior according to constraints on time away from the nest or to variation in resources. However, in the non-breeding season, distributional overlap was greater indicating that the energy required to reach the foraging grounds was less important than the total energy available. These results demonstrate how a marine predator that is not dispersal limited alters its foraging strategy throughout the reproductive cycle to maximize energetic gain and how this has led to differences in plastic ingestion."
https://openalex.org/W2023078090,"Mycoplasma pneumoniae produces an ADP-ribosylating and vacuolating toxin known as the CARDS (Community Acquired Respiratory Distress Syndrome) toxin that has been shown to be cytotoxic to mammalian cells in tissue and organ culture. In this study we tested the ability of recombinant CARDS (rCARDS) toxin to elicit changes within the pulmonary compartment in both mice and baboons. Animals responded to a respiratory exposure to rCARDS toxin in a dose and activity-dependent manner by increasing the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1alpha, 1beta, 6, 12, 17, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma. There was also a dose-dependent increase in several growth factors and chemokines following toxin exposure including KC, IL-8, RANTES, and G-CSF. Increased expression of IFN-gamma was observed only in the baboon; otherwise, mice and baboons responded to CARDS toxin in a very similar manner. Introduction of rCARDS toxin to the airways of mice or baboons resulted in a cellular inflammatory response characterized by a dose-dependent early vacuolization and cytotoxicity of the bronchiolar epithelium followed by a robust peribronchial and perivascular lymphocytic infiltration. In mice, rCARDS toxin caused airway hyper-reactivity two days after toxin exposure as well as prolonged airway obstruction. The changes in airway function, cytokine expression, and cellular inflammation correlate temporally and are consistent with what has been reported for M. pneumoniae infection. Altogether, these data suggest that the CARDS toxin interacts extensively with the pulmonary compartment and that the CARDS toxin is sufficient to cause prolonged inflammatory responses and airway dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2039111504,"Human diseases caused by mutations in extracellular matrix genes are often associated with an increased risk of cataract and lens capsular rupture. However, the underlying mechanisms of cataract pathogenesis in these conditions are still unknown. Using two different mouse models, we show that the accumulation of collagen chains in the secretory pathway activates the stress signaling pathway termed unfolded protein response (UPR). Transgenic mice expressing ectopic Col4a3 and Col4a4 genes in the lens exhibited activation of IRE1, ATF6, and PERK associated with expansion of the endoplasmic reticulum and attenuation of general protein translation. The expression of the transgenes had adverse effects on lens fiber cell differentiation and eventually induced cell death in a group of transgenic fiber cells. In Col4a1(+/Deltaex40) mutant mice, the accumulation of mutant chains also caused low levels of UPR activation. However, cell death was not induced in mutant lenses, suggesting that low levels of UPR activation are not proapoptotic. Collectively, the results provide in vivo evidence for a role of UPR in cataract formation in response to accumulation of terminally unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W2034729360,"The Ewing Sarcoma Family Tumors (ESFT) consist of the classical pathologic entities of Ewing Sarcoma and peripheral Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumor. Occurring largely in the childhood through young adult years, these tumors have an unsurpassed propensity for metastasis and have no defined cell of origin. The biology of these aggressive malignancies centers around EWS/FLI1 and related EWS/ETS chimeric transcription factors, which are largely limited to this tumor class. Much progress has been made in the identification of a network of loci whose expression is modulated by EWS/FLI1 and its congeners. To date, little progress has been made in reconstructing the sequence of direct and indirect events that produce this network of modulated loci. The recent identification of GLI1 as an upregulated target of EWS/ETS transcription factors suggests a target which may be a more central mediator in the ESFT signaling network. In this paper, we further define the relationship of EWS/FLI1 expression and GLI1 upregulation in ESFT. This relationship is supported with data from primary tumor specimens. It is consistently observed across multiple ESFT cell lines and with multiple means of EWS/FLI1 inhibition. GLI1 inhibition affects tumor cell line phenotype whether shRNA or endogenous or pharmacologic inhibitors are employed. As is seen in model transformation systems, GLI1 upregulation by EWS/FLI1 appears to be independent of Hedgehog stimulation. Consistent with a more central role in ESFT pathogenesis, several known EWS/FLI1 targets appear to be targeted through GLI1.

Horses share with humans this characteristic of working on a daily basis and are submitted then to work stressors related to physical constraints and/or more ""psychological"" conflicts, such as potential controversial orders from the riders or the requirement to suppress emotions. On another hand, horses may perform abnormal repetitive behaviour (""stereotypies"") in response to adverse life conditions. In the present study, we investigated whether the type of work the horses are used for may have an impact on their tendency to show stereotypic behaviour (and its type) outside work. Observations in their box of 76 horses all living in the same conditions, belonging to one breed and one sex, revealed that the prevalence and types of stereotypies performed strongly depended upon the type of work they were used for. The stereotypies observed involved mostly mouth movements and head tossing/nodding. Work constraints probably added to unfavourable living conditions, favouring the emergence of chronic abnormal behaviours. This is especially remarkable as the 23 hours spent in the box were influenced by the one hour work performed every day. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of potential effects of work stressors on the emergence of abnormal behaviours in an animal species. It raises an important line of thought on the chronic impact of the work situation on the daily life of individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2061751580,"Although elevated syndecan-2 expression is known to be crucial for the tumorigenic activity in colon carcinoma cells, how syndecan-2 regulates colon cancer is unclear. In human colon adenocarcinoma tissue samples, we found that both mRNA and protein expression of syndecan-2 were increased, compared with the neighboring normal epithelium, suggesting that syndecan-2 plays functional roles in human colon cancer cells. Consistent with this notion, syndecan-2-overexpressing HT-29 colon adenocarcinoma cells showed enhanced migration/invasion, anchorage-independent growth, and primary tumor formation in nude mice, paralleling their morphological changes into highly tumorigenic cells. In addition, our experiments revealed that syndecan-2 enhanced both expression and secretion of matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7), directly interacted with pro-MMP-7, and potentiated the enzymatic activity of pro-MMP-7 by activating its processing into the active MMP-7. Collectively, these data strongly suggest that syndecan-2 functions as a docking receptor for pro-MMP-7 in colon cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2025913916,"Recent ecological studies in invertebrates show that the outcome of an infection is dependent on the specific pairing of host and parasite. Such specificity contrasts the long-held view that invertebrate innate immunity depends on a broad-spectrum recognition system. An important question is whether this specificity is due to the immune response rather than some other interplay between host and parasite genotypes. By measuring the expression of putative bumblebee homologues of antimicrobial peptides in response to infection by their gut trypanosome Crithidia bombi, we demonstrate that expression differences are associated with the specific interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2134594088,"The equal headway instability phenomenon is pervasive in public transport systems. This instability is characterized by an aggregation of vehicles that causes inefficient service. While equal headway instability is common, it has not been studied independently of a particular scenario. However, the phenomenon is apparent in many transport systems and can be modeled and rectified in abstraction.We present a multi-agent simulation where a default method with no restrictions always leads to unstable headways. We discuss two methods that attempt to achieve equal headways, called minimum and maximum. Since one parameter of the methods depends on the passenger density, adaptive versions--where the relevant parameter is adjusted automatically--are also put forward. Our results show that the adaptive maximum method improves significantly over the default method. The model and simulation give insights of the interplay between transport design and passenger behavior. Finally, we provide technological and social suggestions for engineers and passengers to help achieve equal headways and thus reduce delays.The equal headway instability phenomenon can be avoided with the suggested technological and social measures."
https://openalex.org/W1990932508,"Persistent infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) induces tumorigenicity in hepatocytes. To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying this process, we generated monoclonal antibodies on a genome-wide scale against an HCV-expressing human hepatoblastoma-derived cell line, RzM6-LC, showing augmented tumorigenicity. We identified 3β-hydroxysterol Δ24-reductase (DHCR24) from this screen and showed that its expression reflected tumorigenicity. HCV induced the DHCR24 overexpression in human hepatocytes. Ectopic or HCV-induced DHCR24 overexpression resulted in resistance to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis and suppressed p53 activity. DHCR24 overexpression in these cells paralleled the increased interaction between p53 and MDM2 (also known as HDM2), a p53-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase, in the cytoplasm. Persistent DHCR24 overexpression did not alter the phosphorylation status of p53 but resulted in decreased acetylation of p53 at lysine residues 373 and 382 in the nucleus after treatment with hydrogen peroxide. Taken together, these results suggest that DHCR24 is elevated in response to HCV infection and inhibits the p53 stress response by stimulating the accumulation of the MDM2-p53 complex in the cytoplasm and by inhibiting the acetylation of p53 in the nucleus.

NIH3T3 mouse fibroplast cells were from Japanese Collection of Research Bioresource. Cells were cultured under the growth conditions described in the supplemental material. RzM6 cells were established by transfection of HepG2 cells with the plasmid HCR6-Rz, which contains the full-length HCV cDNA (nucleotides 1–9611; GenBankTM accession number AY045702), and stably transformed cell lines were selected in media containing G418 (800 μg/ml bioactive; Invitrogen).

HCV expression was induced by treatment with 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (100 nm). Cells expressing HCV for 44 days (RzM6-44d cells) displayed augmented anchorage-independent cell growth. Cells expressing HCV for more than 44 days are referred to as RzM6-LC cells. The tumor formation assay was performed by injecting RzM6-0d, RzM6-44d, or RzM6-LC cells in the exponential growth phase into nude mice. Cells in culture were harvested with trypsin, and 2 × 106 or 1 × 107 cells were subcutaneously injected into the backs of athymic nude mice (ICR strain, Charles River). HepG2 and WRL68 cells with plasmid DNA or small interfering RNA (siRNA) were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 or RNAi Max (Invitrogen).

Anti-p53 monoclonal antibody (DO-1) and polyclonal antibody (FL-393) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) were used for immunostaining. Phosphorylation of p53 was characterized by Western blotting with antibodies against phosphorylated Ser6, Ser9, Ser15, Ser20, Ser37, Ser46, and Ser329 (Cell Signaling Technologies). Acetylation of p53 was examined by immunoprecipitation with anti-p53 (DO-1) and the ExactaCruz immunoprecipitation reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), followed by Western blotting with antibodies against p53 (rabbit polyclonal; Cell Signaling) or acetylated p53 (Lys373/Lys382) (Upstate Biotechnology).

Purified RNA (2 μg) was reverse-transcribed with Superscript II (Invitrogen) using random primers according to the manufacturer's protocol. The DHCR24 cDNA was then amplified by PCR with Phusion DNA polymerase (BioLabs). The following primers were used for the first round of amplification: D-5-1 (5′-CCCGGGCTGTGGGCTACAGG-3′, forward) and D-3-1 (5′-CCAGGCCACTTTTATTTAAA-3′, reverse). Primers for the second round of amplification were D-5-2 (5′-GTTCTCGAGCAGTGACAGGAGGCGCGAAC-3′, forward) and D-3-2 (5′-GTTCTCGAGTCCAGGCGGGCTCCAGCTCA-3′, reverse). The amplified DHCR24 cDNA was subcloned into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega). In vitro translation was performed using TNT(R) reticulocyte lysate (Promega) and the Express Protein Labeling Mix (New England Nuclear) in the presence of either [35S]Met/Cys or non-radioactive methionine. Amplified DHCR24 cDNA was digested with XhoI and subcloned into the pCAG-PURO vector (16.Tsukiyama-Kohara K. Poulin F. Kohara M. DeMaria C.T. Cheng A. Wu Z. Gingras A.C. Katsume A. Elchebly M.

Amplified DHCR24 cDNA was also subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector containing an HA or FLAG tag (kindly supplied by Dr. N. Takahashi, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology) for transfection into RzM6 or HepG2 cells using Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were selected in media containing G418. The lentiviral vector, pCSII-EF-MCS-EMCV IRES-GFP (generous gift from Hiroyuki Miyoshi, RIKEN, Tsukuba, Japan), was modified by replacing the green fluorescent protein gene with the hygromycin phosphotransferase gene to construct pCSII-EF-MCS-EMCV IRES-Hygro. DHCR24 fused to the 5′-HA or 5′-FLAG tag-encoding sequence were cloned under the EF promoter. The resulting plasmid was cotransfected with packaging plasmid (pCAG-HIVgp and pCMV-VSVG-RSV-Rev) in 293FT cells (Invitrogen) to produce recombinant lentivirus. Following infection, cells were selected with hygromycin B (600 μg/ml; Sigma). The DHCR24 stealth siRNA was designed to target the human DHCR24 mRNA sequence 5′-GCAAGCUGAAUAGCAUUGGCAAUUA-3′ (nucleotides 970–993) using the BLOCK-iT RNAi designer (Invitrogen). A mutated siRNA (5′-GCAGUCUAACGAUUACGGAAAGUUA-3′) was synthesized as a control. An alternative siRNA, siDHCR24-1024, was designed as 5′-GAGAACUAUCUGAAGACAATT-3′. The HCV siRNA was synthesized as previously described (17.Watanabe T. Sudoh M. Miyagishi M. Akashi H. Arai M. Inoue K. Taira K. Yoshiba M. Kohara M. Gene.

Cells were transfected with a 1 nm concentration of the chemically synthesized siRNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 or Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) and then incubated for 4–6 h at 37 °C. Cells were characterized 48 h after transfection. Cells (1 × 104 cells/well) were seeded into white 96-well plates (Sumitomo Bakelite), treated with 1 mm H2O2, and then lysed with caspase-Glo 3/7 buffer (Promega). Caspase 3/7 activity was determined by measuring the absorbance resulting from cleavage of a proluminescent substrate containing the sequence DEVD (Promega) using a multilabel counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter activity was assayed in HepG2, RzM6-0d, or RzM6-LC cells transfected with pWWP-Luc (kindly supplied by Dr. Bert Vogelstein (The Johns Hopkins University)). Cells were cotransfected with phRL-TK(Int-) (Promega) for normalization of promoter activity. Cells were incubated for 2 days after transfection and were then treated with 1 mm H2O2 for 4 h. Promoter activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Detailed procedures are described in the supplemental material. Student's t test was used to test the statistical significance of the results. p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

To identify p60, the protein was purified from RzM6-LC cells using immunoaffinity chromatography and subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (supplemental Fig. 1B). Through this process, p60 was identified as DHCR24 (also known as seladin-1) (18.Iivonen S. Hiltunen M. Alafuzoff I. Mannermaa A. Kerokoski P. Puoliväli J. Salminen A. Helisalmi S. Soininen H.

Maestro R. Galaktionov K. Nature. 2004; 432: 640-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). DHCR24 cDNA was cloned and translated in vitro (Fig. 1C) and also expressed in human embryonic hepatic WRL68 cells (Fig. 1D), and the monoclonal antibody 2-152a reacted with the expressed protein (Fig. 1, D and E). Since DHCR24 was up-regulated in RzM6-LC cells, we examined whether HCV can induce DHCR24 expression in human hepatocytes. We also compared the expression levels of DHCR24 protein and mRNA in a panel of hepatic and embryonic cell lines (Fig. 2A). Northern blotting revealed that DHCR24 mRNA expression was notably higher in RzM6-LC cells than in RzM6-0d cells, indicating that induction of DHCR24 occurs at the transcriptional level. DHCR24 protein levels were also higher in HuH-7 and RzM6-LC cells relative to RzM6-0d cells (Fig. 2A). To examine whether persistent up-regulation of DHCR24 in RzM6-LC cells resulted from HCV expression, we utilized an siRNA to knockdown HCV expression (17.Watanabe T. Sudoh M. Miyagishi M. Akashi H. Arai M. Inoue K. Taira K. Yoshiba M. Kohara M. Gene. Ther. 2006; 13: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). Silencing HCV by greater than 99% with siRNA reduced the expression of DHCR24 and p53 in RzM6-LC cells. When we induced HCV expression with tamoxifen, the induction of DHCR24 was observed after 2, 4, and 6 days (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that expression of the full-length HCV genome induced DHCR24 overexpression. DHCR24 was not induced in HuH-7 cells infected with the HCV strain JFH-1 (22.Wakita T. Pietschmann T. Kato T. Date T. Miyamoto M. Zhao Z. Murthy K. Habermann A. Kräusslich H.G. Mizokami M. Bartenschlager R. Liang T.J. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 791-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (2424) Google Scholar) (data not shown). This result might be explained by the substantial endogenous expression of DHCR24 in HuH-7 cells (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. 1A). To examine whether HCV infection can induce DHCR24, human hepatocytes in chimeric mice were infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or HCV (Fig. 2, D and E). Notable up-regulation of DHCR24 mRNA was detected in HCV-infected human hepatocytes but not in HBV-infected human hepatocytes (Fig. 2F). As HCV infection increased the expression of DHCR24, we further examined the effect of DHCR24 on hepatocytes. Because DHCR24 regulates oxidative stress-induced apoptosis (19.Greeve I.

Fragmentation of genomic DNA was less pronounced in DHCR24-overexpressing cells (RzM6-LC cells and RzM6-0d cells transduced with DHCR24 lentivirus) than in RzM6-0d cells or RzM6-0d cells transduced with empty lentiviral vector. To quantify the apoptotic response, we examined the effect of DHCR24 overexpression on caspase activity (Fig. 3, B–D). Caspase activation by H2O2 was suppressed in RzM6-LC cells compared with RzM6-0d cells (Fig. 3B). Transfection with HCV siRNA recovered the caspase response in RzM6-LC cells. Caspase 3/7 activity was also examined following the transfection of HepG2 cells with pCA-Rz (Fig. 3C). Induction of caspase activation by H2O2 was inhibited by expression of the HCV gene; the inhibition was partially recovered by transfection with DHCR24 siRNA. Moreover, overexpression of DHCR24 from a lentivirus vector (Fig. 3D) (25.Lois C. Hong E.J. Pease S. Brown E.J. Baltimore D. Science. 2002; 295: 868-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar) or from transfection with a DHCR24 expression vector (data not shown) impaired H2O2-induced caspase activation in RzM6-0d cells. Thus, enhanced expression of DHCR24 promotes resistance to H2O2-induced apoptotic responses, and HCV-induced apoptotic resistance is partially mediated by DHCR24. H2O2 induces p53-dependent apoptosis (26.Yamamoto H. Ozaki T. Nakanishi M. Kikuchi H. Yoshida K. Horie H. Kuwano H. Nakagawara A. Genes Cells. 2007; 12: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Expression of the p53-induced apoptotic response mediators, Bax (27.Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and Puma (28.Yu J. Zhang L. Hwang P.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 673-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar), did not increase after H2O2 treatment of RzM6-LC cells (Fig. 4A). Therefore, we examined p53 expression and function in DHCR24-overexpressing cells. H2O2 increased the expression of DHCR24 and p53 in RzM6-0d cells. By comparison, the expression of these proteins was already elevated prior to H2O2 treatment in RzM6-LC cells, and we found no further H2O2-induced increase in expression (Fig. 4A). Consistent with these findings, H2O2 activated transcription from the p21WAF1/CIP promoter in RzM6-0d cells but not in RzM6-LC cells (Fig. 4B). This response of the p21WAF1/CIP promoter is impaired in cells overexpressing DHCR24 via the lentivirus vector (Fig. 4, C and D) or via the expression vector (Fig. 4E). Induction of Bax and Puma expression after H2O2 treatment was decreased in DHCR24-overexpressing cells (Fig. 4F). These results indicate that although p53 expression is elevated in DHCR24-overexpressing cells, the function of p53 in the oxidative stress pathway is impaired. Since DHCR24 is a regulator of the p53-MDM2 interaction (21.Wu C. Miloslavskaya I. Demontis S. Maestro R. Galaktionov K. Nature. 2004; 432: 640-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), we examined the interaction between p53 and its specific ubiquitin ligase, MDM2. Unexpectedly, the interaction between p53 and MDM2 was stronger in RzM6-LC cells than in RzM6-0d cells (Fig. 5, A and B). Lentiviral vector overexpression of DHCR24 in RzM6-0d cells increased the binding of p53 to MDM2 (data not shown). Furthermore, cell fractionation analysis revealed that the interaction between MDM2 and p53 mostly occurred in the cytoplasmic fraction, even after H2O2 treatment (Fig. 5C). Silencing of DHCR24 with siRNA decreased the interaction between p53 and MDM2 (supplemental Fig. 2A). Overexpression of DHCR24 in HepG2 cells increased the interaction between p53 and MDM2 in the cytoplasm (HepG2-DHCR24; Fig. 5D and supplemental Fig. 2, B and C). Level of p53 in the nucleus after treatment with H2O2 was low in RzM6-LC cells (Fig. 5E). In a previous in vitro study that used bacterially expressed and purified protein (21.Wu C. Miloslavskaya I. Demontis S. Maestro R. Galaktionov K. Nature. 2004; 432: 640-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), the interaction between p53 and MDM2 was decreased when the amount of DHCR24 was increased. These discrepancies with our results may be due to the different experimental systems. p53 and DHCR24 were induced by H2O2 in WI38TERT cells (21.Wu C. Miloslavskaya I. Demontis S. Maestro R. Galaktionov K. Nature. 2004; 432: 640-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), as observed in our system (Fig. 5F). However, the interaction between MDM2 and p53 was much lower in WI38 cells than in RzM6 cells (Fig. 5, G and H). Moreover, ectopic expression of DHCR24 did not inhibit apoptotic response to H2O2 in WI38 cells (Fig. 5I) but suppressed apoptosis in HepG2 cells (Fig. 3). This different response may be due to the different regulatory systems of p53 and MDM2 in the liver and lung; MDM2 phosphorylation at Ser166 is regulated by the MEK-ERK (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase-extracellular signal-regulated kinase) pathway in hepatocytes and Akt in lung cells (29.Malmlöf M. Roudier E. Högberg J. Stenius U. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2288-2296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The response of MDM2 at Ser166 to H2O2 was significantly high in liver (HepG2) cells but was low in WI38 cells (supplemental Fig. 2, D and E), as previously observed in A549 cells (29.Malmlöf M. Roudier E. Högberg J. Stenius U. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2288-2296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The up-regulation of MDM2 phosphorylation at Ser166 accelerates its E3 ligase activity (30.Gottlieb T.M. Leal J.F. Seger R. Taya Y. Oren M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1299-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). We also found that overexpression of DHCR24 did not up-regulate the transcription of p53 or MDM2 genes (supplemental Fig. 3, A and B). However, DHCR24 overexpression inhibited polyubiquitination in RzM6-LC cells and H358 (p53 null) cells (supplemental Fig. 3, C–E). This inhibition of polyubiquitination would inhibit p53 degradation, resulting in an increased amount of p53 available to interact with MDM2. We did not detect any p53 nucleotide substitutions in RzM6-LC cells compared with the p53 in RzM6-0d cells (data not shown). Thus, we examined the posttranslational modification of p53, which is thought to be tightly connected to the regulation of its function and localization (31.Bode A.M. Dong Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). We examined the phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 (Fig. 6A); at Ser6, Ser9, Ser20, and Ser37 (supplemental Fig. 4A); and at Ser46 and Ser392 (Fig. 6B) by Western blotting and found no marked differences in phosphorylation after H2O2 treatment between RzM6-0d and RzM6-LC cells. Ser15-phosphorylated p53 was detected in the nuclear fraction of RzM6-0d and RzM6-LC cells after H2O2 treatment (Fig. 6C). We assessed the acetylation of p53 at Lys373 and Lys382 by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting and found that acetylation of p53 was significantly low in RzM6-LC cells compared with RzM6-0d cells following H2O2 treatment (Fig. 6D). H2O2 induced the acetylation of p53 at Lys373 and Lys382 in RzM6-0d cells (Fig. 6E). This acetylation was significantly inhibited in RzM6-LC cells (Fig. 6E). Persistent ectopic overexpression of DHCR24 also repressed H2O2-induced p53 acetylation in the nuclei of HepG2 cells (Fig. 6F). In addition, silencing of DHCR24 by siRNA caused up-regulation of p53 acetylation at Lys373 and Lys382 in RzM6-0d and RzM6-LC cells (Fig. 7A). When the alternative siRNA for DHCR24 (DH1024) was transfected into RzM6-0d cells, the acetylation of p53 was accelerated (Fig. 7B). The mutant DHCR24 vector suppressed the effect of DHCR24 siRNA (supplemental Fig. 4B). These results indicate that overexpression of DHCR24 down-regulates p53 acetylation.FIGURE 7Silencing of DHCR24 increases p53 acetylation. A, RzM6-0d and RzM6-LC cells were untreated (non) or treated with control siRNA (cont. siRNA) or DHCR24 siRNA. Acetylated p53 Lys373 and Lys382 (top) and total p53 (bottom) were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-p53 antibody (DO-1) followed by Western blotting (WB), and the expression of actin and DHCR24 by Western blotting (bottom) was examined. The average ratio of acetylated p53 to total p53 in RzM6-0d cells without treatment is indicated at the bottom. B, RzM6-0d cells were transfected with control siRNA (cont.siRNA), DHCR24 siRNA (DH1024 or DHCR), or untreated (non). Acetylated p53 Lys373 and Lys382 (top) and total p53 (bottom) were immunoprecipitated with anti-p53 antibody followed by Western blotting, and the expression of actin and DHCR24 by Western blotting (bottom) was examined. Reaction with secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit or mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase) alone did not yield any signals (data not shown), and data representative of three independent experiments are shown (A and B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) This study demonstrates that DHCR24 expression parallels hepatocarcinogenesis and that HCV induces overexpression of DHCR24 at both the mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, persistent DHCR24 overexpression suppresses the p53 response to H2O2. These findings are consistent with the previous report that inactivation and mutation of p53 plays a role in the development of HCC (32.Farazi P.A. DePinho R.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 674-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (1671) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes with p53 abnormalities are likely to escape from cell cycle check points and acquire resistance to apoptosis, thereby increasing their tumorigenic potential. Likewise, genetic inactivation of p53 is associated with late stage disease (32.Farazi P.A. DePinho R.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 674-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (1671) Google Scholar). HCV RNA levels are notably lower in cancerous tissues from HCV-positive HCC patients than in noncancerous tissues (33.Tanaka T. Inoue K. Hayashi Y. Abe A. Tsukiyama-Kohara K. Nuriya H. Aoki Y. Kawaguchi R. Kubota K. Yoshiba M. Koike M. Tanaka S. Kohara M. J. Med. Virol. 2004; 72: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, impairment of p53 function by HCV-induced DHCR24 overexpression might play a crucial role in early stage disease progression. In DHCR24-overexpressing cells, p53 was mostly distributed in the cytoplasm (supplemental Fig. 2, A and B). This change in the distribution pattern of p53 might be caused by an increased interaction between p53 and MDM2, which might be induced by increased phosphorylation of MDM2 and suppression of polyubiquitination by overexpression of DHCR24. The up-regulation of the p53-MDM2 interaction negatively regulates p53 and shuttles p53 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (34.Roth J. Dobbelstein M. Freedman D.A. Shenk T. Levine A.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 554-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 35.Freedman D.A. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7288-7293Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). MDM2 inhibits both p53 transcriptional activation and p300-mediated p53 acetylation upon ternary complex formation with p300 and p53 (36.Kobet E. Zeng X. Zhu Y. Keller D. Lu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 12547-12552Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 37.Ito A. Lai C.H. Zhao X. Saito S. Hamilton M.H. Appella E. Yao T.P.

Chem. 2006; 281: 16943-16950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Acetylation of p53 by CBP/p300 mostly occurs in the nucleus (36.Kobet E. Zeng X. Zhu Y. Keller D. Lu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 12547-12552Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Therefore, the increase in cytoplasmic p53-MDM2 complexes in DHCR24-overexpressing cells may account for the observed suppression of p53 acetylation in the nucleus, even after treatment with H2O2 (supplemental Fig. 5). Impaired acetylation of C-terminal lysine residues decreases the sequence-specific DNA-binding activity (39.Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2189) Google Scholar) and the stability of p53 (37.Ito A. Lai C.H. Zhao X. Saito S. Hamilton M.H. Appella E. Yao T.P.

Taken together, our data suggest that DHCR24 overexpression may down-regulate p53 function by inhibiting degradation, increasing the formation of the p53-MDM2 complex in the cytoplasm, and suppressing acetylation of p53 in the nucleus. In conclusion, we propose that HCV infection impairs the function of p53 through DHCR24 overexpression, which up-regulates the interaction between p53 and MDM2 in the cytoplasm and suppresses p53 acetylation in the nucleus. Because overexpression of DHCR24 is observed in other cancers, including melanoma (24.Di Stasi D. Vallacchi V. Campi V. Ranzani T. Daniotti M. Chiodini E. Fiorentini S. Greeve I. Prinetti A.

https://openalex.org/W1969481477,"RIG-I is a pivotal receptor that detects numerous RNA and DNA viruses. Thus, its defectiveness may strongly impair the host antiviral immunity. Remarkably, very little information is available on RIG-I single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) presenting a functional impact on the host response.Here, we studied all non-synonymous SNPs of RIG-I using biochemical and structural modeling approaches. We identified two important variants: (i) a frameshift mutation (P(229)fs) that generates a truncated, constitutively active receptor and (ii) a serine to isoleucine mutation (S(183)I), which drastically inhibits antiviral signaling and exerts a down-regulatory effect, due to unintended stable complexes of RIG-I with itself and with MAVS, a key downstream adapter protein.Hence, this study characterized P(229)fs and S(183)I SNPs as major functional RIG-I variants and potential genetic determinants of viral susceptibility. This work also demonstrated that serine 183 is a residue that critically regulates RIG-I-induced antiviral signaling."

Most DNA polymerases dissociate from their template DNA too rapidly for efficient replication; as a consequence, only a short DNA product is synthesized per binding event. To perform processive DNA synthesis, the catalytic subunit of a DNA polymerase associates with an accessory subunit, forming a holoenzyme that displays a markedly increased affinity for DNA. Consequently, the number of nucleotides incorporated at each binding event is significantly increased. DNA replicases use a variety of accessory subunits for processivity enhancement. Whereas their catalytic subunits of all DNA replicases present a recognizable polymerase (pol) 2The abbreviations used are: polpolymerasentnucleotide(s)aaRSaminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. core structure, the accessory subunits differ considerably in shape and size.

The processivity factor for bacteriophage T7 gene 5 product protein is the small monomeric Escherichia coli protein thioredoxin, which increases polymerase processivity by direct DNA contact and by enhancing interactions of the catalytic subunit with the template DNA (5Doublié S.

The processivity factor for mitochondrial DNA polymerase, pol γB, bears no resemblance to these processivity factors. It is structurally homologous to Class II aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (7Fan L. Sanschagrin P.C. Kaguni L.S. Kuhn L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 9527-9532Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and has a unique mode of action for processivity enhancement. In the holoenzyme, pol γB simultaneously increases the polymerization rate and suppresses the exonuclease activity of the catalytic subunit (8Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38097-38107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Farge G. Pham X.H. Holmlund T. Khorostov I. Falkenberg M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 902-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). By increasing polymerization rate, more nucleotides are incorporated into the product DNA per unit time (thus per binding event). A crystal structure of human mitochondrial DNA polymerase has shed some light on how processivity is achieved by the holoenzyme (10Lee Y.S. Kennedy W.D. Yin Y.W. Cell. 2009; 139: 312-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). pol γ is a heterotrimer where one molecule of pol γA binds to a dimeric pol γB (Fig. 1A). pol γB positions the positively charged AID subdomain of pol γA to bind DNA and preferentially directs the primer terminus into the polymerase active site. The structure reveals that pol γA interacts primarily with one monomer of pol γB and makes only limited contacts with the distal monomer. Interestingly, whereas the mammalian pol γBs are dimeric, that in Drosophila melanogaster is a monomer (11Wernette C.M. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14764-14770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of human holoenzyme suggests that a monomeric pol γB could be completely functional; the question then arises as to the necessity and function of a dimeric pol γB in mammals. Mutations affecting pol γA are common causes of human mitochondrial diseases. The human pol γ structure has rationalized several disease-implicated pol γA mutations that interact with the proximal pol γB monomer (10Lee Y.S. Kennedy W.D. Yin Y.W. Cell. 2009; 139: 312-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). However, interpreting some specific clinical observations with the help of the holoenzyme structure suggests that both pol γB monomers may be important to humans. A patient who died at 6 months of age was found to carry the R232G substitution in pol γA, and other patients were found to carry R232H in trans with other mutations (12Ferrari G. Lamantea E.

Arg232 provides the most significant interaction between pol γA and the distal pol γB monomer by forming a salt bridge with Glu394 of pol γB (Fig. 1A) (10Lee Y.S. Kennedy W.D. Yin Y.W. Cell. 2009; 139: 312-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Although the association of disease with mutations that disrupt the interactions between pol γA and the proximal pol γB monomer is easy to comprehend, any cause and effect relationship between mutations that alter the limited pol γA-distal pol γB monomer interaction is more tenuous without additional biochemical testing. We report here that disruption of the dimeric structure of pol γB decreases the stability of the human holoenzyme and abolishes the acceleration of polymerization rate. Consequently, a monomeric pol γB confers less processivity to the holoenzyme. Our studies further reveal that each pol γB monomer has a distinct role in promoting processive DNA synthesis. All mutants and wild-type pol γB were cloned into pET22b(+), and the C-terminal His-tagged constructs were expressed in E. coli Rosetta (DE3) (Novagen) at 37 °C in LB. Proteins were induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside when the cell density reached 0.6 A600, and the culture was subsequently incubated at a reduced temperature of 25 °C for 6 h before harvesting. The deletion mutant ΔI4 was constructed as previously described (14Carrodeguas J.A. Theis K. Bogenhagen D.F. Kisker C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Other mutant pol γBs were constructed using the following oligonucleotides (mutation sites in bold) as primers for QuikChange (Stratagene) site-directed mutagenesis: D129K, 5′-GCAGGTATTCCCGGTGAAAGCCCTCCACCACAAACC and 5′-GGTTTGTGGTGGAGGGCTTTCACCGGGAATACCTGC; R107E, 5′-CCTTGGGCGTAGAGTTGGAAAAGAACCTGGCCGCAG and 5′-CTGCGGCCAGGTTCTTTTCCAACTCTACGCCCAAGG. The C-terminal His-tagged, exonuclease-deficient catalytic subunit pol γA was constructed by substituting Glu200 with Ala and by deleting the mitochondrial localization sequence (residues 1–29). The exo− pol γA gene was transferred into the baculovirus genome using the shuttle vector pBacPAK9 (Clontech) and expressed in infected Sf9 insect cells.

Sedimentation velocity experiments were conducted at 40,000 rpm, 20 °C, for pol γB wild-type, D129K, ΔI4, and ΔI4-D129K at equal loading concentrations (1.7 μm). Scans were taken at 230 nm in intensity mode. All data, with time invariant noise subtracted, were initially analyzed by the two-dimensional spectrum method (19Brookes E. Cao W. Demeler B. Eur. Biophys. J. 2009; (Epub ahead of print)Google Scholar), and further refined with the genetic algorithm (20Brookes, E., Cao, W., Demeler, B., (2007) GECCO Proceedings, 978-1-59593-697-4/07/0007, ACM, New YorkGoogle Scholar). Statistics were subjected to Monte Carlo analysis (21Demeler B. Brookes E. Colloid Polym. Sci. 2008; 286: 129-137Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Sedimentation coefficient distributions were calculated by the method of van Holde-Weischet as previously described (22Demeler B. van Holde K.E. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 335: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were conducted at 4 °C for pol γB wild-type, mutant D129K, ΔI4, and ΔI4-D129K. Two sets of loading concentrations were prepared for each protein: 3.5, 5.8, and 8.1 μm for scanning at 280 nm and 0.8, 1.3, and 1.8 μm for 230 nm. Samples were centrifuged to equilibrium at 15,000, 18,700, 22,500, 26,200, or 30,000 rpm and scanned simultaneously at 230 and 280 nm. The resulting 30 scans were globally fitted to multiple models as described (23Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys.

The extinction coefficient at 280 nm was determined to be 71,940 absorption unit mol−1cm−1 by amino acid composition (25Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Analyt. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5052) Google Scholar). The extinction coefficient at 230 nm was estimated to be 323,340 absorption unit mol−1cm−1 by globally fitting wavelength scans from each concentration to sums of Gaussian terms (26Yan L. Ge H. Li H.

Polymerization assays used single-stranded M13mp18 DNA annealed to a 26-nucleotide primer (5′-GGATTATTTACATTGGCAGATTCACC). Reactions contained 80 nm pol γA, 200 nm pol γB (or variant), and 50 nm primer/template DNA in 20 μl of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 80 mm KCl, 12.5 mm NaCl, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The holoenzyme titration experiment used pol γA/pol γB ratios of 40 nm/100 nm, 80 nm/200 nm, and 160 nm/400 nm; after preincubation at 37 °C for 5 min, 500 nm poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT) was added as “trap” DNA. Reactions were then initiated by the addition of MgCl2 (10 mm), dNTPs (50 μm dGTP, dATP, and dTTP, 5 μm dCTP, and 0.1 μm [α-32P]dCTP) and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 1% SDS, 20 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mg/ml Protease K and then incubated at 42 °C for 30 min. After applying reaction mixtures to Micro Bio-Spin 6 columns (Bio-Rad) to remove free nucleotides, DNAs were heat-denatured at 95 °C for 5 min in gel loading buffer (70% formamide, 1× Tris, boric acid, and EDTA, 100 mm EDTA), and were analyzed on a 6% polyacrylamide/7 m urea gel. Reaction products were visualized by autoradiography. A 25/45-mer primer-template was prepared by annealing equimolar amounts of 5′-32P-labeled primer (5′-TCCTCGCAGCCGTCCAACCAACTCA) and template (5′-GGACGGCATTGGATCGAGGTTGAGTTGGTTGGACGGCTGCGAGGA) by heating at 95 °C for 5 min and then slowly cooling to 20 °C in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0 at 25 °C) and 50 mm NaCl. Single-nucleotide incorporation DNA polymerization assays were performed using a RQF-3 Rapid Chemical Quench Flow instrument (KinTek Co.), where one syringe contained pol γ·DNA complex (140 nm pol γA, 600 nm pol γB (or variant), 400 nm 25/45-mer DNA, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5 at 25 °C), 100 mm NaCl), and the other syringe contained a nucleotide-magnesium mix (100 μm dATP, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5 at 25 °C), 100 mm NaCl). The reaction was initiated by rapidly mixing equal volumes from each syringe at 37 °C for 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 80, 100, 250, and 500 ms, and 1, 2.5, and 5 s and quenched with 0.5 m EDTA. Quenched reaction samples were applied to a 15% polyacrylamide/7 m urea gel. The 26-mer DNA product was visualized by autoradiography and quantified with software Quantity One (Bio-Rad). The time dependence of the product formation was fit to the burst equation (Equation 1). [product_26-mer]=A(1−e−kpol·t)+kss·t(Eq. 1) Each pol γB variant (2 μm monomer) was analyzed alone, with 1 μm pol γA, or with 1 μm pol γA and 3 μm 25/30-mer (5′-GCATCTACGACCAACTCATACACCT/3′-AAAGGAGGTGTATGAGTTGGTCGTAGATGC) primer/template DNA on a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column. Samples (300 μl) were applied to the column in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5 at 25 °C), 140 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol and eluted at a flow rate of 0.65 ml/min. Eluates were monitored at A280 and A260, and proteins were visualized by Coomassie staining after SDS-PAGE. In contrast to the monomeric Drosophila pol γB, the human protein is a homodimer. To investigate the function of each human pol γB monomer, we constructed a monomeric pol γB, expecting to detect differences in activity between pol γA alone and its complex with a monomeric pol γB (heterodimer AB holoenzyme), or with the dimeric pol γB (heterotrimer AB2 holoenzyme). Guided by bioinformatic, structural, and prior biochemical analyses, we identified two regions that contribute to pol γB dimerization. In comparison to the monomeric Drosophila pol γB, the human protein has two insertions that are located in the dimer interface (Fig. 1, B and D): Insertion I contains residues 165–201, which is part of the four-helical bundle (147–180) formed with the same region from another monomer. The region has been termed I4, and a mutant lacking it has been termed ΔI4 (Fig. 1B) (14Carrodeguas J.A. Theis K. Bogenhagen D.F. Kisker C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Insertion II contains residues Arg107–Val119 and His133–Ala146. This region in human pol γB harbors cross-dimer hydrogen bonds formed by Asp129–Arg107, His77–Asp198, and His133–Glu233, each of which is duplicated by the 2-fold symmetry axis relating the two pol γB monomers (Fig. 1C). The Asp129–Arg107 salt bridges should be particularly strong, because they include both H-bonding and charge-charge interactions. Hypothesizing that both regions are necessary for dimerization, we constructed four human pol γB mutants where the regions are disrupted either individually or jointly: ΔI4 removes the four-helical bundle by replacing residues 147–179 with a Gly-Gly dipeptide. D129K converts the Asp129–Arg107 electrostatic attraction to repulsion by substituting Asp with Lys at position 129. ΔI4-D129K combines the I4 deletion and the D129K substitution. Lastly, anticipating altered activity from mutant ΔI4-D129K, we constructed ΔI4-D129K/R107E, where two substitutions, D129K and R107E, were added to the ΔI4 construct. These substitutions replace the wild-type Asp129–Arg107 pair with a new salt bridge Lys129–Glu107. All proteins were purified to high homogeneity (Fig. 2A). Dimerization of pol γB mutant proteins was first evaluated by analytical ultracentrifugation. We performed sedimentation velocity experiments under identical conditions using pol γB wild-type, D129K, ΔI4, and ΔI4-D129K proteins. Both pol γB wild-type and mutant D129K have the same weight-average sedimentation coefficient of 5.37, indicating that they have identical oligomeric states (Fig. 2B). ΔI4 has a weight-average sedimentation coefficient of 3.74 and shows a typical monomer-dimer equilibrium pattern that is consistent with a weak dimer. Mutant ΔI4-D129K gave a weight-average sedimentation coefficient 3.28, consistent with it being completely monomeric under these conditions. To obtain quantitative measurements of dimer formation and dissociation, we analyzed the proteins by sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation. Mutant ΔI4 best fit a reversible monomer-dimer equilibrium model with a dissociation constant of 16.6 μm, in agreement with the previously reported value of 7 μm (15Yakubovskaya E. Chen Z. Carrodeguas J.A. Kisker C. Bogenhagen D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 374-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). All other pol γB variants were best fit by a single species model, because only a very low level of other species was detected. Wild-type pol γB was calculated to have a molecular mass of 114.1 kDa, and mutant D129K of 99.5 kDa; both values are consistent with the proteins being dimers of a 52.5-kDa protein (by sequence). The mutation D129K therefore appears to have little effect on dimer formation. Conversely, the molecular mass of ΔI4-D129K was estimated to be 50 kDa, consistent with it being monomeric. To estimate the Kd boundary values for these variants, the missing species (monomer for the wild-type and mutant D129K, and dimer for ΔI4-D129K) were assumed to be below the detection limit (A230 < 0.05 absorption units). Data for all pol γB variants are summarized in Table 1.TABLE 1Dissociation constants measured by analytical ultracentrifugationpol γB proteinsKdaMeasured by analytical ultracentrifugation using the sedimentation equilibrium method.Molecular massbBased on genetic algorithm-Monte Carlo analysis of sedimentation velocity data.

Open table in a new tab The oligomeric states of pol γB and variants were independently confirmed by gel-filtration chromatography, extrapolating from their elution volumes and their calculated molecular weights. All proteins were analyzed at 2 μm, a minimum concentration that is dictated by the system's UV detection limit (20 absorption units at 280 nm). Wild-type pol γB elutes with an apparent molecular mass of 100 kDa (Fig. 2C), consistent with it being a dimer. ΔI4 elutes as a broadened peak, suggestive of it being a mixture of 50- and 100-kDa species that correspond to monomers and dimers, and ΔI4-D129K behaves as a 50-kDa monomer. However, when ΔI4-D129K bears the additional R107E substitution, it chromatographs as a dimer. Thus, the D129K-R107E combination, which restores the salt-bridge interaction between two pol γB monomers, also restores the ability to form a dimer that may be even stronger than ΔI4. This result therefore clearly demonstrates the importance of the salt bridge between residues 129 and 107 in pol γB dimer formation. These analyses suggest that alteration of either dimer-stabilization region alone is insufficient to dissociate dimeric pol γB completely under the conditions of our analyses, but together they abolish all significant intermolecular interactions. The Kd for dimerization of pol γB ΔI4-D129K is more than 2000 times higher than that of the wild-type, and the mutant protein can therefore be considered monomeric under our conditions of analysis. Because the construction of pol γB ΔI4-D129K was predicated on the structure of the dimeric human protein and sequence alignment differences with Drosophila pol γB, these data also explain why the latter protein is a monomer. On primed M13 DNA, most products synthesized by pol γA are <100 nt, but, as expected for a processivity factor, when pol γA forms a holoenzyme with wild-type pol γB, they increase in length severalfold and become more abundant (Fig. 3A). Similar results are seen when pol γA complexes with pol γB ΔI4, suggesting that the latter is fully competent to stimulate DNA synthesis in this system. Removal of the four-helical bundle, thereby weakening formation of the pol γB dimer, has little effect. These results are comparable to previous studies comparing wild-type and ΔI4 pol γB (15Yakubovskaya E. Chen Z. Carrodeguas J.A. Kisker C. Bogenhagen D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 374-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In contrast, the monomeric pol γB ΔI4-D129K is much less effective; although a small increase in total products was observed relative to pol γA alone, there was little increase in product length (Fig. 3A). These data suggest that loss of the distal pol γB monomer diminishes holoenzyme processivity. In agreement with this conclusion, when using pol γB ΔI4-D129K/R107E, where the salt bridge and dimerization capability is restored, the resulting holoenzyme exhibits activity comparable to the wild-type or ΔI4-containing enzyme. To test whether the deficiency of the monomeric pol γB is due to an intrinsic lack of activity or to a weakened interaction between subunits, holoenzyme containing monomer pol γB was titrated in a polymerization assay. Activities comparable to the wild-type holoenzyme were observed at concentration 4-fold higher concentration (160 nm, Fig. 3B). ΔI4-D129K at this concentration remains a monomer, and we show below that the corresponding holoenzyme is an AB heterodimer. This indicates that loss of function in ΔI4-D129K is likely caused either by impaired subunit interactions or by impaired interactions of holoenzyme with DNA. To gain a better mechanistic insight of pol γB oligomerization on the polymerization reaction, we used pre-steady-state kinetics to examine single nucleotide incorporation to a 25-mer primer annealed to a 45-mer template (25/45-mer). Identical experiments were carried out with 70 nm pol γA, either with or without 300 nm pol γB wild-type, ΔI4, ΔI4-D129K, or ΔI4-D129K/R107E proteins, 200 nm DNA substrate 25/45-mer. A pre-equilibrated pol·DNA complex was rapidly mixed with 50 μm dATP and 10 mm MgCl2. The time dependence for formation of the 26-mer product was plotted against time (Fig. 4), and data were then fitted to the burst equation: [product_26-mer] = A(1 − e−kpol·t) + kss·t, where A, the burst amplitude, reflects the amount of productive protein·DNA complex that can be turned over in the first cycle of the reaction, and kpol, the burst rate, denotes the fast polymerization rate in the first cycle of the reaction. We should note that kpol is not the initial slope, or the first order derivative of the curve, because (d[product])/dt = A·kpol when t→0, before steady-state conditions apply. The initial slope is thus the product of the two parameters A and kpol. Finally, kss, the steady-state turnover rate, is the slope of the linear steady-state phase of the reaction. Other parameters are computed from the primary experimental data: the off-rate, koff = kss/A, reflects the frequency at which polymerase dissociates from its template, and the equation, processivity = kpol/koff, gives the number of nucleotides incorporated before dissociation. The kinetic parameters for pol γB, both wild-type and variants, are summarized in Table 2.TABLE 2Pre-steady state kinetic parameters for pol γB variantspol γAWild-type pol γBpol γB ΔI4pol γB ΔI4-D129Kpol γB ΔI4-D129K/R107EAmplitude A (nm)25.40 ± 0.7054.83 ± 0.7052.00 ± 0.8045.40 ± 1.0652.09 ± 0.39Burst rate kpol (s−1)13.38 ± 0.9130.99 ± 1.2431.56 ± 1.5214.07 ± 0.8129.32 ± 0.68Steady state rate kss (nm·s−1)10.13 ± 0.263.01 ± 0.303.36 ± 0.345.58 ± 0.402.62 ± 0.16koffaCalculated as koff = kss/A.

Open table in a new tab In the presence of wild-type pol γB, the burst amplitude of pol γA increases from 25 to 55 nm, showing that pol γB increases the formation of a productive protein·DNA complex 2-fold; the burst rate increases from 13 to 31 s−1, indicating that pol γB also accelerates the polymerization rate (Table 2). In addition, kss is reduced 3-fold, indicating a lower steady-state turnover rate. The lower the value of kss, the less likely is polymerase to dissociate from its template. This means that the polymerase can catalyze more rounds of nucleotide incorporation, thereby becoming more processive, before it dissociates from the template. The combination of an increased polymerization rate and a reduced koff, due to the presence of a wild-type dimeric pol γB in holoenzyme, results in an increase in processivity from 33 nt by pol γA alone to 650 nt, a 20-fold enhancement. Pre-steady-state data (Table 2) using pol γB-ΔI4 and pol γB-ΔI4-D129K/R107E show that these proteins have similar properties to wild-type. The monomeric pol γB ΔI4-D129K confers different kinetic properties from a dimeric pol γB. Although pol γB ΔI4-D129K increases the amplitude of the reaction to nearly the same level as the wild-type protein (from 25 to 45 nm), it is unable to accelerate the burst rate (Table 2). Accordingly, the monomeric pol γB increases processivity only from 33 to 117 nt, a mere ∼3.5-fold. To test whether the slightly reduced amplitude of ΔI4-D129K, which is ∼90% of wild-type, was caused by a reduced interaction with pol γA, we repeated the experiment at double the ΔI4-D129K concentration. The amplitudes are the same for ΔI4-D129K at 300 or 600 nm, (45.4 and 45.5 nm, respectively), suggesting the reduction is not due to a reduced interaction with pol γA, rather that a monomeric pol γB is slightly inferior to a dimer in stimulating formation of a productive pol·DNA complex. Importantly, no change of burst rate was observed (14.1 s−1 and 16.3 s−1 at 300 nm and 600 nm, respectively) compared with pol γA alone (13.4 s−1), showing that monomeric pol γB has little or no ability to accelerate the rate of synthesis by pol γA. All the activity assays for holoenzyme containing pol γB-ΔI4 were conducted at concentrations far below the measured Kd for the dimer. pol γB ΔI4 would therefore be expected to be completely monomeric in these reactions, yet it functions as effectively as the dimeric wild-type pol γB and distinctly more effective than pol γB ΔI4-D129K, which is clearly a monomer. The apparent discrepancy in the properties of pol γB ΔI4 suggests that the oligomeric state of"

Recently, studies have highlighted the importance of ERK1/2 scaffold proteins in determining the duration of signaling within the nucleus. ERK1/2 diffuses across the nuclear membrane, with movement in and out of the nucleus determined by both cytoplasmic and nuclear ERK1/2-binding partners (9Burack W.R. Shaw A.S. J. Biol.

Its diffusion is further impeded by phosphorylation, suggesting that active ERK1/2 forms large complexes of low mobility within nuclei (10Costa M. Marchi M. Cardarelli F. Roy A. Beltram F. Maffei L.

However, studies using antibodies generated to peptides along the length of the giant nesprin proteins, have shown that nesprins are also present in other cytoplasmic and nuclear structures (14Zhang Q.

Our understanding of the role of nesprins within these other subcellular compartments remains to be elucidated and to date, very few nesprin interaction partners have been described. Therefore, we set out to identify novel nesprin-2-binding partners as a means to interrogate further the functions of nesprin-2. We identified ERK1/2 and PML as nesprin-2 interaction partners and demonstrate that nesprin-2 acts to scaffold ERK2 within the nucleus at promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies (PML NBs), where this complex serves to inhibit ERK1/2 activity. Thus nesprin-2 plays fundamental roles in regulating nuclear ERK1/2 signaling events and is essential for normal cell cycle progression.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we identify nesprin-2 as a nuclear scaffold and ERK1/2 and PML as novel nesprin-2-interacting proteins. These proteins colocalize and form a complex at PML NBs that block ERK1/2-mediated signaling within the nucleus. Disruption of nesprin-2 function by siRNA-mediated knockdown or overexpression, uncoupled ERK1/2 from PML NBs, augmented nuclear ERK1/2 signaling and ultimately induced cell proliferation. This is the first study to describe an ERK1/2 scaffold that tethers these kinases to a specific subnuclear compartment and suggests that nesprin-2 functions to fine-tune ERK-initiated proliferation in multiple cell types. As such it is likely to be a novel target for modifying the function of these kinases in hyperproliferative disorders such as restenosis.Novel Nesprin-2 Variants Tether ERK1/2 at PML NBsThis study demonstrates for the first time that nesprin-2 plays essential roles within the nucleus. By forming a complex with ERK1/2 and PML, nesprin-2 regulates nuclear signaling events by sequestering active ERK1/2 at PML NBs away from its nuclear targets. The 75-kDa nesprin-2 isoform precipitated by both PML and ERK2 antibodies was present in multiple cell types, implying that nesprin-2 function is highly conserved and that tethering of ERK1/2 at PML NBs is a common mechanism for regulating nuclear activity of these kinases. Disruption of nesprin-2 function, by either siRNA-mediated knockdown or overexpression of a dominant negative fragment, that failed to localize correctly to PML NBs, increased nuclear ERK1/2 activity. Importantly, nesprin-2 knockdown did not disrupt the INM, shown by emerin localization, whereas overexpression of a large nesprin-2 fragment predicted to localize to the ONM, did not affect ERK1/2 activity, confirming that this novel ERK1/2 scaffolding function of nesprin-2 is independent of the previously described NE roles of nesprin-2.PML exists in multiple isoforms that reside in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. Our data demonstrate that nesprin-2 associates with a 50-kDa PML isoform corresponding to the approximate size of PML VIIb (27Reymond A. Meroni G. Fantozzi A. Merla G. Cairo S. Luzi L. Riganelli D.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7223-7233Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). This PML isoform is truncated within the C terminus and lacks the NLS utilized by larger PML isoforms (28Jensen K. Shiels C. Freemont P.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7223-7233Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this isoform is the predominant PML isoform in VSMC lysates and is localized within PML NBs, suggesting that this isoform can enter the nucleus without the NLS and can efficiently incorporate into nuclear bodies.The binding site for ERK1/2 and PML in nesprin-2 occurs within a highly spliced region of the gene. Previous studies have highlighted the multi-isomeric nature of nesprin proteins (11Zhang Q. Skepper J.N. Yang F. Davies J.D. Hegyi L. Roberts R.G. Weissberg P.L. Ellis J.A. Shanahan C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4485-4498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Zhang Q. Ragnauth C.D. Skepper J.N. Worth N.F. Warren D.T. Roberts R.G. Weissberg P.L. Ellis J.A. Shanahan C.M. J.

Med. 2005; 7: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and in this study, using EST data base searching and PCR verification, we identified multiple novel nesprin-2 variants containing the ERK/PML binding domain. The predicted sizes of these variants were between 79 and 377 kDa, which corresponded to the size range of the nesprin-2 variants detected by WB, using the N3 antibody that recognizes an epitope very near the ERK/PML binding domain. Some of these isoforms, including those lacking the KASH domain, were predicted to be in the order of 75 kDa, the size of the nesprin-2 variant that interacts with ERK1/2 and PML. Indeed, the previously described nesprin-2βΔTM fused to a FLAG tag localized at PML NBs, suggesting that this variant scaffolds ERK1/2 at PML NBs. Although our siRNAs also depleted variants of 160 and 100 kDa, this depletion was only partial, and these did not interact with ERK1/2, further supporting nesprin-2βΔTM as the variant of interest.Nesprin-2 Regulates ERK1/2 Activity to Regulate Cell ProliferationNesprin-2 is the first ERK1/2 scaffold that allows compartmentalization of these kinases at specific nuclear subdomains. Subnuclear targeting is essential for both the spatial and temporal regulation of these kinases and differential subnuclear localization may explain variations observed in cellular response to ERK1/2 signaling between different cell types. Indeed, nesprin-2 depletion augmented ERK1/2 activity and increased VSMC proliferation, suggesting that tethering ERK1/2 at PML NBs delays cell cycle progression. The ability to pause within the cell cycle is essential for cells to maintain cell cycle fidelity. We hypothesize that the formation of this complex allows temporary inhibition of ERK1/2 nuclear signaling, without dephosphorylating these kinases, allowing cells to inhibit ERK1/2 activity yet maintain a pool of active ERK1/2 within the nucleus. This may be essential for rapid, transient regulation of these kinases within the nucleus, allowing cells to tightly control transcription factor activation by rapidly inducing cycles of assembly/disassembly of this complex.Importantly, cells also need to delay the cell cycle upon differentiation and we observed that this complex appeared to be more stable in slow growing, more differentiated VSMCs that displayed prominent contractile actin filaments (data not shown). In the vessel wall VSMCs exist in a contractile, differentiated state but are not terminally differentiated and retain the ability to dedifferentiate into a non-contractile, proliferative cell in response to various stimuli, to participate in tissue repair. This unusual feature of VSMCs may explain why they display prominent nesprin-2 and ERK1/2 colocalization at PML NBs. ERK1/2 activity has been shown to determine VSMC phenotype in both health and disease with inhibition of these kinases promoting differentiation and inhibiting proliferation (30Ding H.T. Wang C.G. Zhang T.L. Wang K. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 99: 1343-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 31Tamama K. Sen C.K. Wells A.

Thus, VSMCs potentially utilize this complex to sequester and store active ERK1/2 in the nucleus during differentiation allowing contractile cells to be primed to proliferate upon exposure to the appropriate cues. However, the mechanisms that regulate VMSC dedifferentiation and potential roles for the nesprin-2/ERK/PML complex in this process require further investigation. In addition, the modifications and other factors that influence the assembly/disassembly of this complex remain to be elucidated.Potential Roles for Nesprin-2 in Linking PML NBs to the Nuclear Matrix Independent of NE FunctionLittle is known about how nuclear substructures like PML NBs are spatially and temporally organized. Importantly, the ERK1/2 and PML binding regions are just upstream of a lamin A/C-interacting region identified in nesprin-2α, suggesting that these binding elements are present in close proximity. Evidence suggests that the 75-kDa variant identified in this study contains both regions. Indeed, only nesprin-2 fragments containing the lamin A/C binding region efficiently accumulated within the nucleus suggesting that nuclear lamina associations may be essential for the nuclear retention of nesprin-2. In addition, we previously showed that the nesprin-2 N3 antibody, used in this study, can efficiently immunoprecipitate lamins A/C both in vitro and in vivo (11Zhang Q. Skepper J.N. Yang F.

The lamins immunoprecipitated in vivo are likely to be the intranuclear lamins as the NE-associated lamins A/C cannot be solubilized effectively further suggesting that nesprin-2 forms intra-lamina connections.Previous studies have demonstrated essential roles for the nuclear lamina in regulating/organizing signaling proteins. The phosphorylation and nuclear localization of retinoblastoma protein (Rb), in nuclear speckles is dependent on the integrity of the nuclear lamina and its disruption in cells lacking lamins A/C induces proliferation defects (6Ozaki T.

Similarly, nesprin-2 may mediate connections between lamins A/C and PML NBs with this spatial organization important for the integrity of ERK signaling. Thus, nuclear lamina disruption may impact upon the nesprin-2/ERK/PML complex also implicating these proteins in the highly complex pathologies associated with laminopathy syndromes that arise because of mutations in lamins A/C and its NE-binding partners, including nesprin-2 (25Zhang Q.

Recently, studies have highlighted the importance of ERK1/2 scaffold proteins in determining the duration of signaling within the nucleus. ERK1/2 diffuses across the nuclear membrane, with movement in and out of the nucleus determined by both cytoplasmic and nuclear ERK1/2-binding partners (9Burack W.R. Shaw A.S. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4952-4963Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Its diffusion is further impeded by phosphorylation, suggesting that active ERK1/2 forms large complexes of low mobility within nuclei (10Costa M. Marchi M. Cardarelli F. Roy A. Beltram F. Maffei L. Ratto G.M. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4952-4963Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However the precise localization and components of these complexes remain unknown.Nesprins are a novel family of spectrin repeat-containing proteins that were originally identified from a differential cDNA screen as highly expressed in differentiated vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) (11Zhang Q.

To date, four nesprin genes have been identified that encode a plethora of variants that vary greatly in size. The largest, or giant variants of nesprin-1 and nesprin-2 consist of an N-terminal-paired calponin homology domain, a central rod domain comprised of multiple spectrin repeats, and a C-terminal Klarsicht, ANC-1, Syne Homology (KASH) domain required for NE localization (11Zhang Q.

We studied if signals from the two pathways could be integrated in a synergistic manner to trigger neurite outgrowth in Neuro2A cells. At low concentrations, when agonist at either receptor by itself has no effect, we found that CB1R and IL-6R stimulation together induced synergistic neurite outgrowth. Signal integration requires activation of transcription factors by Src, Jak, and mitogen-activated protein kinases. Mitogen-activated protein kinase can be activated by both receptors and shows enhanced early activation in the presence of both ligands. CREB and STAT3 transcription factors are required for synergy and show enhanced DNA-binding activity when both receptors are activated. STAT3 plays a critical role in integration of the signals downstream of the two receptors. When both pathways are activated, STAT3 phosphorylation is sustained for 6 h.

The chronobiological study of Caenorhabditis elegans, an extensively used animal model for developmental and genetic research, might provide fundamental information about the basis of circadian rhythmicity in eukaryotes, due to its ease of use and manipulations, as well as availability of genetic data and mutant strains. The aim of this study is to fully characterize the circadian rhythm of locomotor activity in C. elegans, as well as a means for genetic screening in this nematode and the identification of circadian mutants. We have developed an infrared method to measure locomotor activity in C. elegans and found that, under constant conditions, although inter-individual variability is present, circadian periodicity shows a population distribution of periods centered at 23.9±0.4 h and is temperature-compensated. Locomotor activity is entrainable by light-dark cycles and by low-amplitude temperature cycles, peaking around the night-day transition and day, respectively. In addition, lin-42(mg152) or lin-42(n1089) mutants (bearing a mutation in the lin-42 gene, homolog to the per gene) exhibit a significantly longer circadian period of 25.2±0.4 h or 25.6±0.5 h, respectively. Our results represent a complete description of the locomotor activity rhythm in C. elegans, with a methodology that allowed us to uncover three of the key features of circadian systems: entrainment, free-running and temperature compensation. In addition, abnormal circadian periods in clock mutants suggest a common molecular machinery responsible for circadian rhythmicity. Our analysis of circadian rhythmicity in C. elegans opens the possibility for further screening for circadian mutations in this species."
https://openalex.org/W2075694920,"Infection of macrophages with the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii results in inhibition of a large panel of LPS-responsive cytokines, including TNF-α, while leaving others such as IL-10 intact. Recent studies provide evidence that the parasite interferes with chromatin remodeling at the TNF-α promoter that is normally associated with LPS stimulation, but that is not required for TLR4 induction of IL-10. Here, we examined the effect of Toxoplasma on IL-10 induced by simultaneous signaling through TLR4 and FcγR, a combined stimulus that triggers histone H3 covalent modification at the IL-10 promoter resulting in high level IL-10 cytokine production. We show that the parasite inhibits high level IL-10 production and prevents histone H3 Ser10 phosphorylation and Lys9/14 acetylation at the IL-10 promoter. These results provide compelling evidence that T. gondii targets the host cell chromatin remodeling machinery to down-regulate cytokine responses in infected macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W1981476642,"Bone marrow (BM)-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) have therapeutic potentials in promoting tissue regeneration, but how these cells are modulated in vivo has been elusive. Here, we report that RBP-J, the critical transcription factor mediating Notch signaling, modulates EPC through CXCR4. In a mouse partial hepatectomy (PHx) model, RBP-J deficient EPC showed attenuated capacities of homing and facilitating liver regeneration. In resting mice, the conditional deletion of RBP-J led to a decrease of BM EPC, with a concomitant increase of EPC in the peripheral blood. This was accompanied by a down-regulation of CXCR4 on EPC in BM, although CXCR4 expression on EPC in the circulation was up-regulated in the absence of RBP-J. PHx in RBP-J deficient mice induced stronger EPC mobilization. In vitro, RBP-J deficient EPC showed lowered capacities of adhering, migrating, and forming vessel-like structures in three-dimensional cultures. Over-expression of CXCR4 could at least rescue the defects in vessel formation by the RBP-J deficient EPC. These data suggested that the RBP-J-mediated Notch signaling regulated EPC mobilization and function, at least partially through dynamic modulation of CXCR4 expression. Our findings not only provide new insights into the regulation of EPC, but also have implications for clinical therapies using EPC in diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1979493779,"Modern crops have usually experienced domestication selection and subsequent genetic improvement (post-domestication selection). Chinese waxy maize, which originated from non-glutinous domesticated maize (Zea mays ssp. mays), provides a unique model for investigating the post-domestication selection of maize. In this study, the genetic diversity of six key genes in the starch pathway was investigated in a glutinous population that included 55 Chinese waxy accessions, and a selective bottleneck that resulted in apparent reductions in diversity in Chinese waxy maize was observed. Significant positive selection in waxy (wx) but not amylose extender1 (ae1) was detected in the glutinous population, in complete contrast to the findings in non-glutinous maize, which indicated a shift in the selection target from ae1 to wx during the improvement of Chinese waxy maize. Our results suggest that an agronomic trait can be quickly improved into a target trait with changes in the selection target among genes in a crop pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2025485872,"Cardiac induction, the first step in heart development in vertebrate embryos, is thought to be initiated by anterior endoderm during gastrulation, but what the signals are and how they act is unknown. Several signaling pathways, including FGF, Nodal, BMP and Wnt have been implicated in cardiac specification, in both gain- and loss-of-function experiments. However, as these pathways regulate germ layer formation and patterning, their specific roles in cardiac induction have been difficult to define.To investigate the mechanisms of cardiac induction directly we devised an assay based on conjugates of anterior endoderm from early gastrula stage Xenopus embryos as the inducing tissue and pluripotent ectodermal explants as the responding tissue. We show that the anterior endoderm produces a specific signal, as skeletal muscle is not induced. Cardiac inducing signal needs up to two hours of interaction with the responding tissue to produce an effect. While we found that the BMP pathway was not necessary, our results demonstrate that the FGF and Nodal pathways are essential for cardiogenesis. They were required only during the first hour of cardiogenesis, while sustained activation of ERK was required for at least four hours. Our results also show that transient early activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway has no effect on cardiogenesis, while later activation of the pathway antagonizes cardiac differentiation.We have described an assay for investigating the mechanisms of cardiac induction by anterior endoderm. The assay was used to provide evidence for a direct, early and transient requirement of FGF and Nodal pathways. In addition, we demonstrate that Wnt/beta-catenin pathway plays no direct role in vertebrate cardiac specification, but needs to be suppressed just prior to differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1987289541,"The lipid raft location of μ-opioid receptor (MOR) determines the receptor activities. However, the manner in which MOR is anchored within the lipid rafts is undetermined. Using the targeted proteomic approach and mass spectrometry analyses, we have identified GRIN1 (G protein-regulated inducer of neurite outgrowth 1) can tether MOR with the G protein α-subunit and subsequently regulate the receptor distribution within the lipid rafts. Glutathione S-transferase fusion pulldown and receptor mutational analyses indicate that GRIN1-MOR interaction involves a receptor sequence 267GSKEK271 within the MOR third intracellular loop that is not involved in Gα interaction. The GRIN1 domains involved in MOR interaction are also distinct from those involved in Gα interaction. Pertussis toxin pretreatment reduced the amount of GRIN1 co-immunoprecipitated with MOR but not the amount with Gα. Furthermore, overexpression of GRIN1 significantly enhanced the amount of MOR in lipid raft and the receptor signaling magnitude as measured by Src kinase activation. Such increase in MOR signaling was demonstrated further by determining the GRIN1-dependent pertussis toxin-sensitive neurite outgrowth. In contrast to minimal neurite outgrowth induced by etorphine in control neuroblastoma N2A cells, overexpression of GRIN1 resulted in the increase in etorphine- and non-morphine-induced neurite outgrowth in these cells. Knocking down endogenous GRIN1 by small interfering RNA attenuated the agonist-induced neurite outgrowth. Disrupting lipid raft by methyl-β-cyclodextrin also blocked neurite outgrowth.

GPCR signaling complex consists minimally of three protein components as follows: a receptor, a G protein, and a signaling effector. During the course of receptor signaling, these components at one time must physically interact with each other for signals to propagate. Lipid rafts, microdomains located within the plasma membrane, cluster receptors and components of receptor signaling cascades. Selective partitioning of proteins into lipid rafts often influences lipid transport, membrane trafficking, and signal transduction. In this manner, lipid rafts can serve as signaling platforms for receptors and effectors (1.Cohen A.W. Hnasko R. Schubert W. Lisanti M.P. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 1341-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Proteins known to interact with lipid rafts and to have activities influenced by such interaction, include GPCRs (e.g. the β2-adrenergic receptor), tyrosine kinase receptors (e.g. epidermal growth factor receptors and nerve growth factor receptors), GTPases (e.g. H-Ras and α-subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins), and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (e.g. Src and Src family kinases), as well as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK kinase and ERK (2.Chun M.

The function of lipid rafts in organizing and mediating signal transduction of GPCRs was reported for many receptor classes and subtypes (9.Monastyrskaya K. Hostettler A. Buergi S. Draeger A. J.

Physical interaction between opioid receptor and G protein in lipid raft represents the high affinity state of agonist binding (11.Carter B.D. Medzihradsky F. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 1611-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 12.McKenzie F.R. Milligan G. Biochem. J. 1990; 267: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), suggesting that the localization of receptor and G protein in lipid rafts may facilitate their coupling and subsequently influence agonist binding to receptors. It is highlighted in recent studies that the influence of lipid rafts on signaling proteins is dynamic in both directions (13.Ohkubo S. Nakahata N. Yakugaku Zasshi. 2007; 127: 27-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 14.Reversi A. Rimoldi V. Brambillasca S. Chini B. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp.

This means that proteins are able to mediate their signaling environment (e.g. post-translational modification such as palmitoylation/depalmitoylation or myristoylation/demyristoylation can affect the length of stay in the lipid rafts of signaling proteins, and the different affinities of signaling proteins for lipid rafts can affect themselves and their associated proteins to be held in or expelled out of lipid rafts, thereby modifying the properties and organization of signaling proteins in lipid rafts (16.Resh M.D. Sci. STKE. 2006; 2006: re14Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 17.Barnett-Norris J. Lynch D. Reggio P.H. Life Sci. 2005; 77: 1625-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar)). Finally, signaling amplitude can be amplified or diminished in these signaling microdomains. Collectively, the varieties of interactions between lipid rafts and proteins reflect the complexity of their relationship and the multitude of possible regulatory processes involved in GPCR-associated signal transduction (13.Ohkubo S. Nakahata N. Yakugaku Zasshi. 2007; 127: 27-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 18.Head B.P. Insel P.A.

Opioid receptors, being members of the rhodopsin subfamily among the GPCR superfamily, have been shown to locate within the lipid raft domains both in the in vitro cell models and in vivo (19.Xu W. Yoon S.I. Huang P. Wang Y. Chen C. Chong P.L. Liu-Chen L.Y. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006; 317: 1295-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 20.Zheng H. Chu J. Qiu Y. Loh H.H. Law P.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 9421-9426Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, raft domains differentially affect agonist binding of different opioid receptors and the receptor coupling to the G proteins, which determine the distinct signaling pathways selected for receptor signaling. For example, human κ-opioid receptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells are located in lipid rafts, and cholesterol depletion of these cells has no effect on the association between κ-opioid receptors and G protein (19.Xu W. Yoon S.I. Huang P. Wang Y. Chen C. Chong P.L. Liu-Chen L.Y. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006; 317: 1295-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), indicating receptor and G protein occupy different membrane microdomains. By contrast, the receptor location within the lipid raft regulates agonist-selected signal transduction of μ-opioid receptors (MOR), and which raft location reflects the receptor-G protein coupling in lipid raft (20.Zheng H. Chu J. Qiu Y. Loh H.H. Law P.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 9421-9426Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism in which the G protein can cluster MOR within the lipid raft and subsequently regulate the agonist-selective signaling remains undetermined. To address these issues, yeast two-hybrid system and GST fusion protein pulldown assay were used to identify some components of the scaffolding complex of GPCRs (21.Evans B.J. Wang Z. Mobley L. Khosravi D. Fujii N. Navenot J.M. Peiper S.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 377: 1067-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 22.Chen C. Li J.G. Chen Y. Huang P. Wang Y. Liu-Chen L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7983-7993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). But as to these methods, only one or two domains of the receptor were used to construct a fusion protein for identifying scaffolding proteins. They cannot reflect agonist/antagonist-mediated conformational change responsible for protein recruitment. To identify the binding partners of MOR, we purified MOR complexes from neuroblastoma Neuro2A (N2A) cells stably expressing His6-tagged MOR with Ni2+ affinity chromatography, separated the MOR-associated protein complex by SDS-PAGE, and determined individual protein identities with mass spectrometry analyses. Among the identified proteins, GRIN1 (G protein-regulated inducer of neurite outgrowth 1) has been found to be directly associated with MOR. GRIN1 was initially found specifically expressed in brain and interacted selectively with activated α-subunits of the Gi subfamily (Giα, Goα, and Gzα). GRIN1 co-localizes with Goα at the growth cone of neuronal cells and promotes neurite extension in N2A cells (23.Chen L.T. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26931-26938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It was reported that the interaction between GRIN1 and activated Goα induced activation of Cdc42, which led to morphological changes in neuronal cells (24.Nakata H. Kozasa T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that GRIN1 serves as a tether for MOR and Gα that results in the clustering of MOR within the lipid rafts. Such immobilization of MOR within lipid rafts induces neurite outgrowth in the presence of etorphine. Our data suggested that GRIN1 had a distinct function besides its reported interaction with activated Giα. The rat MOR-tagged with the His6 epitope at the N terminus was subcloned in pCDNAmp vector. N2A cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum (DMEM growth medium) in a 10% CO2 incubator. These N2A cells were transfected with 10 μg of the His6-MOR plasmids. The colonies surviving 1 mg/ml antibiotic of geneticin were isolated. The cell clone that expressed MOR of 0.8 pmol/mg protein was used in the receptor complex purification. As for transient transfection of cDNA, N2A cells were plated on 100-mm dishes (immunoprecipitation studies) at a density of 250,000 cells/ml and maintained in DMEM growth medium to 80% confluency. Transfections were performed using the Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Transfection medium was replaced with medium containing fresh serum 12–18 h after transfection, and cells were harvested 24–48 h later. The methods have been described in a previous paper (25.Ge X. Loh H.H. Law P.Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2009; 75: 1307-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, 60 150-mm dishes of N2A cells stably expressing His6-MOR, together with 60 150-mm dishes of N2A cells as control were lysed with 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 2 h. Lysate was collected and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was collected and purified by Ni2+ resin columns (Invitrogen). Then columns were washed 10 times with wash buffer and eluted with elution buffer provided by the kit (Invitrogen). Eluates were concentrated with Amicon concentration cells (Amicon, Beverly, MA). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and silver-stained, and the presence of MOR was identified by Western blot analysis. As for mass spectrometry analyses and identification of the proteins, silver-stained gel bands were excised, dried, and destained by incubating in 15 mm K3Fe(CN)6 and 50 mm Na2S2O3 at 24 °C for 15 min, followed by washing with 100 mm NH4HCO3. Destained gels were dried and rehydrated in 50 mm NH4HCO3 and 5 mm CaCl2 solution with 0.01 mg/ml sequence-grade modified porcine trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) and then incubated at 37 °C overnight. Trypsinized fragments were collected by sonicating the gel pieces in 50 μl of 25 mm NH4HCO3 together with 50 μl of 50% acetonitrile. The supernatant was collected and sonicated repeatedly in 50 μl of 5% formic acid and added with 50 μl of 50% acetonitrile again. The supernatant was pooled together. DTT was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. Prior to MALDI-TOF analysis, the sample was desalted using Millipore C18 ZipTips, using the protocol described by Millipore, with the following modification: the elution buffer was 60:40, acetonitrile/water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The instrument used for the collection of MALDI-TOF was a Bruker Biflex III, equipped with an N2 laser (337 nm, 3-ns pulse length) and a microchannel plate detector. The data were collected in the reflectron mode, positive polarity, with an accelerating potential of 19 kV. Each spectrum is the accumulation of ∼200 laser shots. External calibration was performed using human angiotensin II (monoisotopic mass [MH+] 1046.5; Sigma) and adrenocorticotropin hormone fragment 18–39 (monoisotopic mass [MH+] 2465.2; Sigma). The matrix used for samples and standards was α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Hewlett-Packard, sold in solution, in methanol) diluted 1:1 with 50:50 acetonitrile/nanopure water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. High pressure liquid chromatography-grade acetonitrile was purchased from Fisher, and +99% spectrophotometric grade trifluoroacetic acid was purchased by Sigma. Confluent cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4 °C and lysed for 30 min in solubilization buffer (0.5% polyoxyethylene (10.Navratil A.M. Bliss S.P. Berghorn K.A. Haughian J.M.

Lysate was centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 × g, and the supernatant was collected and assayed for protein by the BCA method (Pierce). A total of 500 μg of protein precleared with protein G-Sepharose beads was incubated with 1 μg of mouse anti-FLAG antibodies for 2–3 h followed by incubation with 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Sigma) for 3 h at 4 °C. Sepharose beads were pelleted by brief centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 4 °C and washed three times with solubilization buffer. Proteins were eluted by resuspending the beads in 2 volumes of 2× SDS sample buffer (10 mm Tris, 15 mm SDS, 20 mm DTT, 20% glycerol, 0.02% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8) followed by incubation at 65 °C for 30 min. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), followed by immunoblotting with anti-GRIN1 primary antibodies (T116), and detected with anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase-linked secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad) diluted in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% powdered milk and 0.1% Tween 20 unless indicated otherwise. The constructs are translated in vitro using the TnT Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega) according to the company's protocol. In brief, the TnT buffer, rabbit reticulocyte lysate, RNA polymerase, amino acid mixture, and RNase inhibitor were added together in a 0.5-ml microcentrifuge tube placed on ice. 1 μg of plasmid DNA was added last to the tube and to the reaction mixture. Components were spun to the bottom of tube and mixed by centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 15 s. After that, the reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 90 min and then terminated by keeping in store at −80 °C. The GST fusion proteins of MOR second intracellular loop (MORIL2), MOR third intracellular loop (MORIL3), and MOR C-tail (MORCT) were constructed by cloning the PCR products of these receptor domains into the BamHI site of the pGXT2 vector. These PCR products were generated using the rMOR cDNA cloned in pRCcmv and the following primers: MORIL2 sense, GGATCCCTCTGCACCATGAGCGTGGAC, and antisense, GGATCCTCAGCAGACGTTGACGATTTTGGC; MORIL3 sense, GGATCCTACGGCCTGATGATCTTACGA, and antisense, GGATCCTCACACGACCACCAGCACCATCCG; and MORCT sense, GGATCCGATGAAAACTTCAAGCGATGC, and antisense, GGATCCTTAGGGCAATGGAGCAGTTTC. The plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RP (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and the production of fusion proteins was induced by addition of 2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. GST, MORIL2, MORIL3, or MORCT proteins were adsorbed onto glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) and washed three times with PBS prior to the pulldown analyses. In vitro translation product of GRIN1 was incubated with GST or GST-MOR second and GST-MOR third intracellular loop and GST-MOR C-tail fusion protein preloaded glutathione-agarose beads on an end-to-end rocker for 1 h at 4 °C. After that, beads were washed three times with ice-cold GST buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 5% glycerol, pH 8.0) containing 1 mm complete mixture (Roche Applied Science). Subsequently, samples were eluted with GST buffer containing 10 mm reduced glutathione, and proteins were separated with SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was performed with mouse anti-HA antibody (Covance) for HA-GRIN1. The loading amount of GST or GST-MOR second and GST-MOR third intracellular loop and GST-MOR C-tail fusion proteins were detected with Coomassie Blue staining. GST-tagged MORi33 mutant (MORi33) and MORi35 mutant (MORi35) were constructed by cloning the PCR products of MORi33 or MORi35 mutants into the BamHI/EcoRI site of the pGXT2 vector. These PCR products were generated using the rMOR cDNA cloned in pRCcmv and the following primers: MORi33 sense, GGATCCTACGGCCTGATGATCTTACG, and antisense, CCGGGTGATCCTGCGCAG; MORi35 sense, GGATCCTACGGCCTGATGATCTTACG, and antisense, CAGATTCCTGTCCTTTTC. The plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RP (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and the production of fusion proteins was induced by addition of 2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The method was described previously (25.Ge X. Loh H.H. Law P.Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2009; 75: 1307-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), followed by incubation with in vitro translation product of HA-GRIN1 or premixing of in vitro translation product of HA-GRIN1 and GST-MORi33 or GST-MORi35 by covering the corresponding spot of Immobilon-P membrane with transparency films (3M, St. Paul, MN) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed three times at room temperature with TTBS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4) and immunoblotted with mouse anti-HA primary antibodies (Covance). The direct interaction of the in vitro translated product was detected with anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase-linked secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad) diluted in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% powdered milk and 0.1% Tween 20.

Adherent cultured N2A cells transfected with GFP-GRIN1 siRNA with or without GRIN1 overexpression rescue and positive control treated by actinomycin D (1 mm) were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, on the coverslips in a 6-well plate at room temperature. After excess liquid was removed, the coverslips were washed with two changes of PBS, 5 min for each wash. The coverslips were post-fixed in precooled ethanol/acetic acid 2:1 for 5 min at −20 °C, followed by washing with two changes of PBS, 5 min for each wash. Afterward, excess liquid was aspirated carefully, and 75 μl/5 cm2 of equilibration buffer (Millipore) was added directly on the specimen for 10 s at room temperature. The coverslips were incubated with 100 μl/5-cm2 working strength terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase enzyme in a humidified chamber at 37 °C for 1 h. The cells were placed in working strength stop/wash buffer (Millipore), then agitated for 15 s, and incubated in the same buffer for 10 min. The cells were washed in two changes of PBS for 1 min per wash. 100 μl/5-cm2 anti-digoxigenin conjugate of rhodamine (Millipore) was added to the slides. The slides were incubated in a humidified chamber for 30 min at room temperature while avoiding exposure to light. Afterward, the cells were washed in four changes of PBS for 2 min per wash. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (1:100, 500 μl) was added to the cells for 1 h at room temperature, and the cells were washed in four changes of PBS for 2 min per wash. The cells were mounted with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech). For statistical analysis, images from more than 20 fields in each sample were calculated. The percentages of cells inducing apoptosis versus total cells were analyzed with Prism 4, version 4.0, by GraphPad Software, Inc. Cells transfected with GFP-GRIN1 were grown in 10-mm culture plates with a glass coverslip at the bottom to 30–40% confluency and treated with 100 nm etorphine or with 100 nm morphine as indicated for 10 min. After that, cells were washed with fresh medium three times and incubated in fresh medium without fetal bovine serum at 37 °C for 48 h. GFP-tagged GRIN1s were visualized by immunofluorescence using a CARV IITM Confocal Imager (BD Biosciences) and a Leica DMIRE2 fluorescence microscope. Fluorescence images of the same cells were taken at time “0” after medium was changed and at different time points during agonist incubation as indicated. For statistical analysis, images from more than 20 fields in each sample were measured and calculated. The percentages of cells possessing neurite outgrowth versus total cells were analyzed with Prism 4, version 4.0, by GraphPad Software, Inc. The construction of PTX-resistant adeno-Giα2-Leu, adeno-Giα3-Leu, and adeno-Goα-Leu was described previously (26.Zhang L. Tetrault J. Wang W. Loh H.H. Law P.Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 1810-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). N2A cells stably expressing MOR with HA-tagged at the N terminus in 100-mm dishes were infected with PTX-resistant adeno-Giα2-Leu, adeno-Giα3-Leu, or adeno-Goα-Leu viruses using Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) as described previously (26.Zhang L. Tetrault J. Wang W. Loh H.H. Law P.Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 1810-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). 24 h later, cells were transfected with HA-GRIN1 using Superfect transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. The next day, 100 ng/ml PTX was added, and the cells were incubated overnight. Then the cells were treated with 100 nm etorphine for 10 min or with saline. Cells were then lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5% C12E10 supplemented with Complete Protease Inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)). After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Giα2 and Giα3 (27.Roerig S.C. Loh H.H. Law P.Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 822-831PubMed Google Scholar) or Goα (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Fremont, CA) antibody and recombinant protein G-agarose beads (Invitrogen) at 4 °C overnight. Then the beads were washed five times with cell lysis buffer and were extracted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and were analyzed by Western blot analysis with anti-HA antibody. For control, the cells were not infected with adeno-Giα2-Leu, adeno-Giα3-Leu, or adeno-Goα-Leu viruses but transfected with HA-GRIN1 to exclude the nonspecific binding. ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare) was used for quantification analysis.

Briefly, male Sprague-Dawley rats, postnatal day 28 (P28) to P35, were euthanized by decapitation, and the brains were rapidly removed into ice-cold dissection buffer (2.6 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1.23 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm dextrose, 212.7 mm sucrose, and 26 mm NaHCO3). The components having high endogenous MOR expression such as lateral parabrachial nucleus, laminae, striatum, hippocampi, presubiculum and parasubiculum, amygdaloid nuclei, thalamic nuclei, locus coeruleus, etc., were removed and unrolled. Minislices (400 μm) were prepared and transferred to a holding chamber containing artificial cerebrospinal fluid (124 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.25 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm dextrose, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 26 mm NaHCO3) bubbled with 95% O2, 5% CO2 maintained at 32 °C."
https://openalex.org/W2056914950,"Extracellular heat shock protein 72 (Hsp72; inducible form of the 70-kDa heat shock protein) plays a critical role in innate and adaptive immune responses and has shown promise as an ideal adjuvant for the optimization of antigen-specific anti-tumor vaccines. Recent studies suggest that to correctly elucidate the mechanisms by which Hsp72 exerts its beneficial effects in vitro, great care must be taken to ensure that endotoxin by-products do not invalidate the findings. In this study, we have taken advantage of the baculovirus expression vector system for production of endotoxin-free recombinant Hsp72. The coding sequence of human hsp72 was recombined into the baculovirus immediately downstream of the strong polyhedron gene promoter. Ninety-six h post-infection of Sf9 insect cells with recombinant baculovirus, maximal levels of Hsp72 protein were detected. The recombinant human Hsp72 was purified by affinity chromatography from insect cells, and purity was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry. The purified human recombinant Hsp72(bv) (Hsp72 produced using the BEVS) was demonstrated to have no endotoxin contamination and was shown to have stimulated potent calcium flux in the human monocytic cell line. Furthermore, recombinant Hsp72(bv) enhanced the tolerance of neuroblastoma cells to heat stress-induced cell death and displayed classical chaperokine functions including augmentation of inflammatory cytokine productions in mouse splenocytes. The production of functional, endotoxin-free recombinant human Hsp72(bv) in insect cells is inexpensive and convenient and eliminates the need of special procedures for endotoxin depletion. Endotoxin-free recombinant human Hsp72(bv) can now be used to unlock the important role Hsp72 plays in modulating immune function."
https://openalex.org/W2062005682,"Oral sex is widely used in human foreplay, but rarely documented in other animals. Fellatio has been recorded in bonobos Pan paniscus, but even then functions largely as play behaviour among juvenile males. The short-nosed fruit bat Cynopterus sphinx exhibits resource defence polygyny and one sexually active male often roosts with groups of females in tents made from leaves. Female bats often lick their mate's penis during dorsoventral copulation. The female lowers her head to lick the shaft or the base of the male's penis but does not lick the glans penis which has already penetrated the vagina. Males never withdrew their penis when it was licked by the mating partner. A positive relationship exists between the length of time that the female licked the male's penis during copulation and the duration of copulation. Furthermore, mating pairs spent significantly more time in copulation if the female licked her mate's penis than if fellatio was absent. Males also show postcopulatory genital grooming after intromission. At present, we do not know why genital licking occurs, and we present four non-mutually exclusive hypotheses that may explain the function of fellatio in C. sphinx."
https://openalex.org/W2005382172,"Circadian rhythms in animals are regulated at the level of individual cells and by systemic signaling to coordinate the activities of multiple tissues. The circadian pacemakers have several physiological outputs, including daily locomotor rhythms. Several redox-active compounds have been found to function in regulation of circadian rhythms in cells, however, how particular compounds might be involved in regulating specific animal behaviors remains largely unknown. Here the effects of hydrogen peroxide on Drosophila movement were analyzed using a recently developed three-dimensional real-time multiple fly tracking assay. Both hydrogen peroxide feeding and direct injection of hydrogen peroxide caused increased adult fly locomotor activity. Continuous treatment with hydrogen peroxide also suppressed daily locomotor rhythms. Conditional over-expression of the hydrogen peroxide-producing enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) also increased fly activity and altered the patterns of locomotor activity across days and weeks. The real-time fly tracking system allowed for detailed analysis of the effects of these manipulations on behavior. For example, both hydrogen peroxide feeding and SOD over-expression increased all fly motion parameters, however, hydrogen peroxide feeding caused relatively more erratic movement, whereas SOD over-expression produced relatively faster-moving flies. Taken together, the data demonstrate that hydrogen peroxide has dramatic effects on fly movement and daily locomotor rhythms, and implicate hydrogen peroxide in the normal control of these processes."
https://openalex.org/W2049032075,"Components of the COP9 signalosome (CSN), a key member of the conserved 26S proteasome degradation pathway, have been detected to be altered in patients of several debilitating syndromes. These findings suggest that CSN acts in neural circuits, but the exact function of CSN in brain remains unidentified. Previously, using Drosophila peripheral nervous system (PNS) as a model system, we determined that CSN is a critical regulator of dendritic morphogenesis. We found that defects in CSN led to the strikingly contrast phenotype of either reducing or stimulating dendritic branching. In particular, we have reported that CSN stimulates dendritic branching via Cullin1-mediated proteolysis. Here we describe that CSN inhibits dendritic arborization in PNS neurons acting via control of Cullin3 function: loss of Cullin3 causes excessive dendritic branching. We also identified a downstream target for Cullin3-dependent degradation in neurons – the actin-crosslinking BTB-domain protein Kelch. Inappropriate accumulation of Kelch, either due to the impaired Cullin3-dependent turnover, or ectopic expression of Kelch, leads to uncontrolled dendritic branching. These findings indicate that the CSN pathway modulates neuronal network in a multilayer manner, providing the foundation for new insight into the CSN role in human mental retardation disorders and neurodegenerative disease."
https://openalex.org/W1964180504,"The usual paradigm for translocations is that they should not take place in declining populations until the causes(s) of the decline has been reversed. This approach sounds intuitive, but may not apply in cases where population decline is caused by behavioral or demographic mechanisms that could only be reversed by translocation itself.We analyzed a decade of field data for Pyrenean brown bears (Ursus arctos) from two small populations: the growing Central population--created from a previous translocation and the endemic Western population--believed to be declining because of excessive human-caused mortality. We found that adult survival rates for both populations were as high as those observed for most other protected brown bear populations. However, the Western population had much lower reproductive success than the Central population. Adult breeding sex ratio was male-biased in the Western population and female-biased in the Central population. Our results exclude high anthropogenic mortality as a cause for population decline in the West but support low reproductive success, which could result from sexually selected infanticide induced by a male-biased adult sex ratio or inbreeding depression. Using a stochastic demographic model to compute how many bears should be released to ensure viability, we show that the Western population could recover provided adequate numbers of new females are translocated.We suggest that a translocation could take place, even if the decline has not yet been reversed, if the translocation itself removes the biological mechanisms behind the decline. In our case, the ultimate cause of low reproductive success remained unknown (infanticide or inbreeding), but our proposed translocation strategies should eliminate the proximate cause (low reproductive success) of the decline and ensure population recovery and viability."
https://openalex.org/W2079692550,"Vaccinia viral envelope protein A27 (110 amino acids) specifically interacts with heparin (HP) or heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans for cell surface attachment. To examine the binding mechanism, a truncated soluble form of A27 (sA27-aa; residues 21-84 of A27) with Cys(71) and Cys(72) mutated to Ala was used as the parent molecule. sA27-aa consists of two structurally distinct domains, a flexible Arg/Lys-rich heparin-binding site (HBS) (residues 21-32; (21)STKAAKKPEAKR(32)) and a rigid coiled-coil domain (residues 43-84), both essential for the specific binding. As shown by surface plasmon resonance (SPR), the binding affinity of sA27-aa for HP (K(A) = 1.25 x 10(8) m(-1)) was approximately 3 orders of magnitude stronger than that for nonspecific binding, such as to chondroitin sulfate (K(A) = 1.65 x 10(5) m(-1)). Using site-directed mutagenesis of HBS and solution NMR, we identified a ""KKPE"" segment with a turn-like conformation that mediates specific HP binding. In addition, a double mutant T22K/A25K in which the KKPE segment remained intact showed an extremely high affinity for HP (K(A) = 1.9 x 10(11) m(-1)). Importantly, T22K/A25K retained the binding specificity for HP and HS but not chondroitin sulfate, as shown by in vitro SPR and in vivo cell adhesion and competitive binding assays. Molecular modeling of the HBS was performed by dynamics simulations and provides an explanation of the specific binding mechanism in good agreement with the site-directed mutagenesis and SPR results. We conclude that a turn-like structure introduced by the KKPE segment in vaccinia viral envelope protein A27 is responsible for its specific binding to HP and to HS on cell surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W2098640879,"Here we describe human spotted cell chips, a technology for determining cellular state across arrays of cells subjected to chemical or genetic perturbation. Cells are grown and treated under standard tissue culture conditions before being fixed and printed onto replicate glass slides, effectively decoupling the experimental conditions from the assay technique. Each slide is then probed using immunofluorescence or other optical reporter and assayed by automated microscopy. We show potential applications of the cell chip by assaying HeLa and A549 samples for changes in target protein abundance (of the dsRNA-activated protein kinase PKR), subcellular localization (nuclear translocation of NFkappaB) and activation state (phosphorylation of STAT1 and of the p38 and JNK stress kinases) in response to treatment by several chemical effectors (anisomycin, TNFalpha, and interferon), and we demonstrate scalability by printing a chip with approximately 4,700 discrete samples of HeLa cells. Coupling this technology to high-throughput methods for culturing and treating cell lines could enable researchers to examine the impact of exogenous effectors on the same population of experimentally treated cells across multiple reporter targets potentially representing a variety of molecular systems, thus producing a highly multiplexed dataset with minimized experimental variance and at reduced reagent cost compared to alternative techniques. The ability to prepare and store chips also allows researchers to follow up on observations gleaned from initial screens with maximal repeatability."
https://openalex.org/W1986347648,"beta-Galactose residues on N-glycans have been implicated to be involved in growth regulation of cells. In the present study we compared the galactosylation of cell surface N-glycans of mouse Balb/3T3 cells between 30 and 100% densities and found the beta-1,4-galactosylation of N-glycans increases predominantly in a 100-kDa protein band on lectin blot analysis in combination with digestions by diplococcal beta-galactosidase and N-glycanase. When cells at 100% density were treated with jack bean beta-galactosidase, the incorporation of 5-bromodeoxyuridine into the cells was stimulated in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting the involvement of the galactose residues in growth regulation of cells. A galactose-binding protein was isolated from the plasma membranes of cells at 100% density by affinity chromatography using an asialo-transferrin-Sepharose column and found to be galectin-3 as revealed by mass spectrometric analysis. The addition of recombinant galectin-3 into cells at 50% density inhibited the incorporation of 5-bromodeoxyuridine in a dose-dependent manner, but the inhibition was prevented with haptenic sugar. An immunocytochemical study showed that galectin-3 is present at the surface of cells at 100% density but not at 30% density where it locates inside the cells. Several glycoproteins bind to a galectin-3-immobilized column, a major of which was identified as vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1. Immunocytochemical studies showed that some galectin-3 and VCAM-1 co-localize at the surface of cells at 100% density, indicating that the binding of galectin-3 secreted from cells to VCAM-1 is one of the pathways involved in the growth regulation of Balb/3T3 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2072548209,"Chemokines are extracellular mediators of complex regulatory circuits involved principally in cell-to-cell communication. Most studies to date of the essential chemokine Cxcl12 (Sdf-1) have focused on the ubiquitously expressed secreted isoforms alpha and beta. Here we show that, unlike these isoforms and all other known chemokines, the alternatively transcribed gamma isoform is an intracellular protein that localizes to the nucleolus in differentiated mouse Cardiac tissue. Our results demonstrate that nucleolar transportation is encoded by a nucleolar-localization signal in the unique carboxy-terminal region of Sdf-1gamma, and is competent both in vivo and in vitro. The molecular mechanism underlying these unusual chemokine properties involves cardiac-specific transcription of an mRNA containing a unique short-leader sequence lacking the signal peptide and translation from a non-canonical CUG codon. Our results provide an example of genome economy even for essential and highly conserved genes such as Cxcl12, and suggest that chemokines can exert tissue specific functions unrelated to cell-to-cell communication."
https://openalex.org/W2089250004,"A previous analysis of World Records (WR) has revealed the potential limits of human physiology through athletes' personal commitment. The impact of political factors on sports has only been studied through Olympic medals and results. Here we studied 2876 WR from 63 nations in four summer disciplines. We propose three new indicators and show the impact of historical, geographical and economical factors on the regional WR evolution. The south-eastward path of weighted annual barycenter (i.e. the average of country coordinates weighting by the WR number) shows the emergence of East Africa and China in WR archives. Home WR ratio decreased from 79.9% before the second World War to 23.3% in 2008, underlining sports globalization. Annual Cumulative Proportions (ACP, i.e. the cumulative sum of the WR annual rate) highlight the regional rates of progression. For all regions, the mean slope of ACP during the Olympic era is 0.0101, with a maximum between 1950 and 1989 (0.0156). For European countries, this indicator reflects major historical events (slowdown for western countries after 1945, slowdown for eastern countries after 1990). Mean North-American ACP slope is 0.0029 over the century with an acceleration between 1950 and 1989 at 0.0046. Russia takes off in 1935 and slows down in 1988 (0.0038). For Eastern Europe, maximal progression is seen between 1970 and 1989 (0.0045). China starts in 1979 with a maximum between 1990 and 2008 (0.0021), while other regions have largely declined (mean ACP slope for all other countries = 0.0011). A similar trend is observed for the evolution of the 10 best performers. The national analysis of WR reveals a precise and quantifiable link between the sport performances of a country, its historical or geopolitical context, and its steps of development."
https://openalex.org/W2097430149,"Although the striatum is in position to regulate motor function, the role of the structure in locomotor behaviour is poorly understood. Therefore, a detailed analysis of locomotion- and obstacle avoidance-related parameters was performed after unilateral lesion of the striatum in rats.Using the three dimensional motion capture technology, kinematics of walking and clearing obstacles, head and body orientation were analyzed before and up to 60 days after the lesion. Recordings were performed in treadmill running rats with or without obstacles attached to the treadmill belt. The lesion, which was induced by the direct injection of the mitochondrial toxin malonate into the left caudoputamen resulted in the complete destruction of the dorsal striatum. During the first three days following the lesion, rats were unable to run on the treadmill. Thereafter, rats showed normal looking locomotion, yet the contralesional limbs exhibited changes in length and timing parameters, and were overflexed. Moreover, the head of lesioned rats was orientated towards the side of the lesion, and their postural vertical shifted towards the contralesional side. During obstructed running, the contralesional limbs when they were leading the crossing manoeuvre stepped on the obstacle rather than to overcome obstacle without touching it, yet more frequently with the forelimb than the hindlimb. Unsuccessful crossings appeared to be due to a paw placement farther away from the front of the obstacles, and not to an inappropriate limb elevation. Importantly, deficit in locomotor behaviour did not regress over the time.Our results argue that the striatum of one hemisphere controls kinematics of contralateral limbs during stereotyped locomotion and plays a prominent role in the selection of the right motor program so that these limbs successfully cross over obstacle."

TM2 is an amphipathic helix that forms the inner lining of the channel pore. The ligand-binding pocket is located at the interface between adjacent ECDs and is covered by the flexible loop C (9.Gay E.A. Yakel J.L. J. Physiol. 2007; 584: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Consequently, channel gating is mediated through an interaction of the ECD with the TMs. The Cys-loop, a loop within the ECD harboring two conserved cysteines, is eponymous for the superfamily of these ligand-gated ion channels. The Cys-loop extends into the interface between the ECD and TM domains, suggesting an important role in channel gating (10.Bocquet N. Nury H. Baaden M. Le Poupon C. Changeux J.P. Delarue M. Corringer P.J. Nature. 2009; 457: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). It is generally assumed that these cysteine residues form a family-specific disulfide bond stabilizing the Cys-loop. Their functional role for the nAChR was explored using reducing agents and site-directed mutagenesis, which demonstrated influences on receptor expression and physiology (11.Rojas L. Zuazaga C. Steinacker A. Brain Res. 1991; 551: 10-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 12.Sumikawa K. Gehle V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6286-6290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Direct experimental evidence for the formation of the disulfide bond in the Cys-loop comes from chemical modification of informative peptides of purified Torpedo nAChR and from crystallography of the ECD of the murine nAChRα1 subunit (7.Dellisanti C.D. Yao Y. Stroud J.C. Wang Z.Z. Chen L. Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 953-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 13.Kao P.N. Karlin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8085-8088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the GlyR ECD, in addition to the Cys-loop, loop C is also thought to be stabilized by a second, unique disulfide bond. This assumption is based on recombinant expression studies with mutant receptor constructs (14.Rajendra S. Vandenberg R.J. Pierce K.D. Cunningham A.M. French P.W. Barry P.H. Schofield P.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2987-2998Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the human GlyRα1 ECD, putative formation of the Cys-loop disulfide bond (Cys138–Cys152) and the GlyR-specific disulfide bond (Cys198–Cys209) would leave one cysteine residue (Cys41) unpaired. To our knowledge, there is no direct experimental evidence for disulfide bond formation in the GlyR ECD. Starting from a multiple sequence alignment, we generated a model for the GlyRα1 ECD, consistent with specific formation of both the Cys-loop and the GlyR-specific disulfide bond. Making use of isolated GlyRα1 ECD obtained from Escherichia coli expression and functional refolding (15.Breitinger U. Breitinger H.G. Bauer F. Fahmy K. Glockenhammer D. Becker C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1627-1636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we identified tryptic fragments corresponding to the predicted disulfide bonds by matrix-assisted laser-desorption-ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. To elucidate their functional relevance, we generated serine mutants for each cysteine residue, preventing the formation of the respective disulfide bonds in isolated ECD and full-length receptor constructs. Our results suggest that the cysteine residues play important roles in receptor maturation. For sequence alignment, amino acid sequences of mature human nAChRα2, α3, α5, α7, and β2 subunits, human GlyRα1, α2, and α3 subunits, the murine nAChRα1 subunit (mm-ECD), and the L. stagnalis AChBP were obtained from the Swiss Prot data base (16.The UniProt ConsortiumNucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: D190-D195Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). For transmembrane proteins, ECD sequences were used as annotated. A multiple sequence alignment was performed with ClustalW (17.Larkin M.A. Blackshields G. Brown N.P. Chenna R. McGettigan P.A. McWilliam H. Valentin F. Wallace I.M. Wilm A. Lopez R. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Higgins D.G. Bioinformatics. 2007; 23: 2947-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (22339) Google Scholar) followed by minimal manual corrections. Based on the crystal structure of the murine nAChRα1 ECD (9.Gay E.A. Yakel J.L. J. Physiol. 2007; 584: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the homology model of the human GlyRα1 ECD was generated using Swiss Model (18.Arnold K. Bordoli L. Kopp J. Schwede T. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (6004) Google Scholar). Appropriate cysteine bonds were manually added followed by 100 steps of conjugate gradient energy minimization in Sybyl 7.3 (Tripos Inc., Munich, Germany). For bacterial expression, the pET30a vector (EMD, San Diego, CA) containing the isolated human GlyRα1 ECD was used. The full-length human GlyRα1 receptor subunit in pRK5 was used for expression in HEK293 cells. Single amino acid substitutions were introduced using PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. All plasmids were sequence verified. Recombinant expression of the isolated GlyRα1 ECD constructs and refolding under oxidative conditions (using CuCl2) was carried out essentially as described (15.Breitinger U. Breitinger H.G. Bauer F. Fahmy K. Glockenhammer D. Becker C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1627-1636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Deviating from this protocol, RosettaGami2 cells (EMD) were used for expression and affinity purification was omitted. For tryptic proteolysis of the refolded ECD, the proteins were dialyzed against cleavage buffer (25 mm NH4HCO3). The protease-to-protein ratio was adjusted to 1:100 and cleavage was carried out at 37 °C overnight to obtain complete digestion. For limited proteolysis, protease-to-protein ratios of 1:500 or less were used. Where needed, dithiothreitol (5 mm final concentration) was added and reduction of the disulfide bonds was performed at 56 °C for 30 min. Modification of cysteine residues was performed for 1 h with a 40-fold molar excess of N-maleoyl-β-alanine (Sigma) over the concentration of dithiothreitol used. Lysine modification was performed with O-methylisourea using the proteomass guanidination kit (Sigma). All peptide samples were cleaned using Zip-Tip reversed phase microcolumns (Millipore, Billerica) prior to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Tryptically digested protein samples were dried using a vacuum concentrator (Eppendorf, Hamburg). The pellet was dissolved in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. 2 μl of the sample were mixed with 2 μl of 2% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and 2 μl of dihydroxyacetophenone matrix (15 mg/ml of 2,5-dihydroxyacetophenone, 5 mg/ml of diammonium hydrogen citrate in 75% ethanol). An aliquot of 0.5 μl was spotted on a stainless steel target and allowed to dry at ambient temperature. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed on a Bruker Autoflex (Bruker Daltonik, Bremen, Germany), equipped with a nitrogen laser (λ = 337 nm). Positive ions were analyzed in the reflector mode after acceleration by 20 kV. External calibration was performed using the peptide calibration standard (Bruker Daltonik, Bremen, Germany). For each displayed mass spectrum, at least 250 individual spectra obtained from several positions on a spot were averaged. Spectrum analysis was performed using Flex Analysis software (Bruker Daltonik). Circular dichroism spectra were recorded on a Jasco J810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Groß-Umstadt) equipped with a Peltier element. Data were recorded from wild-type as well as cysteine-mutant GlyRα1 ECDs in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 20 °C from 260 to 190 nm with a step size of 0.2 nm and an integration time of 2 s in a quartz cell with 0.1-cm path length. Concentrations were determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm and ranged from 2.0 to 5.6 μm. A blank spectrum with buffer only was recorded under identical conditions and subtracted from the spectra. Spectra were smoothed using a Savitzky-Golay filter with a window size of 11 data points. Secondary structure contents were estimated using the DICHROWEB service (19.Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. Biopolymers. 2008; 89: 392-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar, 20.Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W668-W673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1975) Google Scholar) applying the CDSSTR algorithm with the SP175(190) reference data base (21.Lees J.G. Miles A.J. Wien F. Wallace B.A. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 1955-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Binding of [3H]strychnine and [3H]glycine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to refolded proteins was performed as described (15.Breitinger U. Breitinger H.G. Bauer F. Fahmy K. Glockenhammer D. Becker C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1627-1636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To achieve retention of the refolded protein on GF/C filters, it was precipitated with an equal volume of 15% PEG400 in binding buffer (25 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.4, 200 mm KCl). Filters were washed with binding buffer after application of the protein; short washing times were essential. Unlabeled strychnine (200 μm) and glycine (200 mm) were used for competition and unspecific binding was subtracted. The affinity of [3H]strychnine binding was determined by Scatchard analysis (15.Breitinger U. Breitinger H.G. Bauer F. Fahmy K. Glockenhammer D. Becker C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1627-1636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were transfected according to a modified calcium phosphate protocol. Where necessary, cells were cotransfected with enhanced green fluorescent protein. For Western blot analysis, cells were harvested and homogenized in PBS at 4 °C. After centrifugation for 30 min at 100,000 × g, the pellet was resuspended in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer containing protease inhibitors (Complete EDTA-free; Roche Applied Science). The protein concentration was determined and equal amounts were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot. For detection of GlyRα1, the mouse monoclonal antibody mAb4a (supernatant of hybridoma cells) was used. Goat anti-mouse antibody coupled to Cy5 (1:250) or horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000) was used for visualization (Dianova, Hamburg). For immunocytochemistry, transfected HEK293 cells were washed 3 times in PBS and fixed for 30 min with paraformaldehyde (3% w/v in PBS) followed by quenching with 50 mm ammonium chloride in PBS. Blocking was performed with 5% (v/v) sheep serum in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. To perform staining of intracellular GlyRs, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 was added to the blocking solution to permeabilize the plasma membrane. For staining of the ECD of GlyRα1, purified mouse monoclonal antibody mAb2b was used in blocking solution (1:200). Transfected cells were incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature and washed 3 times with PBS. This procedure was repeated with goat anti-mouse antibody coupled to Alexa 488 (1:400 in blocking solution; Invitrogen). Finally, cells were embedded in Mowiol and subjected to confocal microscopy on a DMIRE2 confocal microscope (Leica, Wetzlar). Electrophysiology was carried out essentially as described (22.Oertel J. Villmann C. Kettenmann H. Kirchhoff F. Becker C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2798-2807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Under the conditions used, recombinant GlyRs showed little desensitization, consistent with earlier reports (23.Legendre P. Muller E. Badiu C.I. Meier J. Vannier C. Triller A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 817-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The human GlyRα1 ECD contains five cysteine residues (Cys41, Cys138, Cys152, Cys198, and Cys209). We generated a multiple sequence alignment for ECDs of several nAChR and GlyR subunit variants as well as the AChBP (Fig. 1A). This confirmed that only the cysteines within the Cys-loop (C138, C152) were conserved among the proteins analyzed, which is in agreement with previous alignments (4.Grudzinska J. Schemm R. Haeger S. Nicke A. Schmalzing G. Betz H. Laube B. Neuron. 2005; 45: 727-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 6.Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). Based on the crystal structure of the murine nAChRα1 (7.Dellisanti C.D. Yao Y. Stroud J.C. Wang Z.Z. Chen L. Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 953-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), a model of the human GlyRα1 ECD was generated. This model indicated the opposition of both conserved cysteine residues in the Cys-loop as well as two GlyR-specific cysteines in the loop C (Cys198 and Cys209), allowing disulfide bond formation. The model also predicted that cysteine residue Cys41 is buried, suggesting that it is not involved in disulfide bond formation (Fig. 1B). To analyze the status of the GlyR extracellular cysteines under in vitro conditions, the isolated GlyRα1 ECD was expressed in E. coli and refolded from inclusion bodies under oxidative conditions as described (15.Breitinger U. Breitinger H.G. Bauer F. Fahmy K. Glockenhammer D. Becker C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1627-1636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), obtaining native-like ligand-binding capability. Then, the ECD was digested with trypsin and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, yielding a signal of 6728.1 Da matching the calculated mass of the tryptic fragments holding Cys138 and Cys152 linked by a disulfide bond (Fig. 2A). When the peptide mixture was chemically reduced to break disulfide bonds, this molecular mass disappeared, leaving signals (1318.9 and 5414.3 Da), which matched the calculated masses of the respective reduced fragments (Fig. 2A). Apparently, the pseudo-ion observed in the non-reduced sample contained a bond cleavable under mild reducing conditions, as expected for a disulfide bond. Respective single fragments, however, were still detectable in the non-reduced samples, suggesting that cysteine bonding was not fully completed during in vitro refolding. In some experiments, the tryptic peptides were chemically modified using side chain reactive agents. When the single fragments were modified with N-maleoyl-β-alanine, a mass shift of +169 Da occurred, consistent with the presence of a single sulfhydryl group in each fragment (Fig. 2, B and C). Finally, the reduced fragment holding Cys138 was modified once with O-methylisourea (+42 Da), which is in agreement with the presence of a single lysine residue, further corroborating the identity of this fragment (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, we found a second informative proton adduct of 1350.8 Da, matching the theoretical mass of the tryptic fragments harboring Cys198 and Cys209 linked by a disulfide bond. This bonded fragment, again, disappeared after chemical reduction, leaving the corresponding single fragments (514.1 and 839.5 Da) (Fig. 3A). Under oxidative conditions, signals representing single fragments were low in MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Mass shifts upon modification with N-maleoyl-β-alanine and O-methylisourea indicated the presence of cysteine residues in both single fragments as well as the presence of a lysine residue in the bonded fragment (Fig. 3, B–D). After limited tryptic proteolysis, we also found a proton adduct corresponding to the mass of a single fragment with 3 missed cleavages harboring both Cys198 and Cys209 (Fig. 4). The mass of this fragment was increased by 2 Da upon reduction, indicating cleavage of an intrapeptide disulfide bond. This observation confirmed our previous results. In all of our spectra, we exclusively found signals indicating bonds formed between Cys138 and Cys152, as well as Cys198 and Cys209, respectively. In particular, no alternative bond between these cysteines or to Cys41 was observed in any of the experiments. A fragment harboring Cys41 could be readily detected and modified (Fig. 5). The identities of all detected lysine and cysteine harboring fragments were confirmed by chemical modification. Taken together, identifiable fragments covered more than 95% of the protein sequence (Fig. 6). These data indicate selective formation of the predicted Cys-loop and GlyR-specific disulfide bond in the GlyRα1 ECD.FIGURE 6Summary of all detected GlyRα1 ECD peptides and their modifications. The complete amino acid sequence of the bacterial expression construct is shown. Bars indicate observed tryptic fragments as detected by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Theoretical monoisotopic molecular masses (Da) are given for each fragment. Where essential, corresponding average molecular masses are given in brackets. Redundant fragments resulting from limited proteolysis are omitted. The number of asterisks (*) indicates the number of observed lysine modifications for each peptide.

The total sequence coverage is greater than 95%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To analyze the process of disulfide formation in vitro, we generated single cysteine-to-serine substitutions of the ECD constructs. The mutant ECDs were expressed in E. coli, forming inclusion bodies, and subjected to refolding under oxidative conditions. Surprisingly, all mutants appeared to readily refold, yielding considerable concentrations of soluble protein. None of the mutants displayed increased precipitation, essentially resembling the wild-type situation (data not shown). This suggested that the overall fold of the ECD may be independent of disulfide bond formation. Subsequently, the mutant ECDs were subjected to tryptic digestion and analysis by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The single fragments holding mutant residues showed the expected mass shifts resulting from mutagenesis. The pseudo-ion corresponding to the bonding of Cys198 and Cys209 was observed for wild-type and mutant constructs C41S, C138S, and C152S, but not for C198S and C209S (Fig. 7). The bonding of Cys138 and Cys152, however, was only observed for wild-type and C41S, indicating that, in vitro, formation of the Cys-loop disulfide bond may require the presence of the GlyR-specific bond. To analyze secondary structure elements of GlyRα1 ECDs, the refolded proteins were subjected to circular dichroism spectroscopy. The resulting spectrum of wild-type ECD was consistent with previous observations (15.Breitinger U. Breitinger H.G. Bauer F. Fahmy K. Glockenhammer D. Becker C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1627-1636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and very well superimposed with spectra obtained from each of the mutants (Fig. 8A), indicating an overall comparable secondary structure content (Table 1). This result is in line with an equally efficient in vitro refolding of all ECD variants. Furthermore, the composition of secondary structure elements is in good agreement with our proposed model of the GlyRα1 ECD.TABLE 1Calculated secondary structure from CD spectroscopySampleα-Helixβ-SheetTurnUnordered%Wild-type8361243C41S9371242C138S11361241C152S8351243C198S7381142C209S9381241 Open table in a new tab In a filtration assay, the refolded wild-type GlyRα1 ECD showed high affinity [3H]strychnine binding (Fig. 8B) with KD values ranging from 25 to 70 nm, similar to our earlier report (15.Breitinger U. Breitinger H.G. Bauer F. Fahmy K. Glockenhammer D. Becker C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1627-1636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, [3H]strychnine binding was partially displaceable by an excess of unlabeled glycine. Conversely, we observed strychnine-displaceable [3H]glycine binding (Fig. 8C). With the filtration assay used (15.Breitinger U. Breitinger H.G. Bauer F. Fahmy K. Glockenhammer D. Becker C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1627-1636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), saturation of [3H]glycine binding was not achieved, consistent with the low affinity of the glycine site (2.Breitinger H.G. Becker C.M. ChemBioChem. 2002; 3: 1042-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 4.Grudzinska J. Schemm R. Haeger S. Nicke A. Schmalzing G. Betz H. Laube B. Neuron. 2005; 45: 727-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). This precluded a determination of the corresponding KD value. Taken together, this indicates that a mutually exclusive binding site for glycine and strychnine had formed in the refolded ECD. Apparently, the ECD folded into its native-like, functional conformation. To address the function of the disulfide bonds, we performed single cysteine-to-serine substitutions in the ECD of full-length GlyRα1 constructs. The constructs were expressed in HEK293 cells and immunostained with mAb2b recognizing the extracellular domain of GlyRα1. Discrimination between surface expression and intracellular retention of the GlyR protein was achieved through facultative permeabilization of the cells prior to immunostaining. In confocal immunocytochemistry of transfected, non-permeabilized HEK293 cells, mutant GlyRs C41S and C138S showed reduced surface expression. In contrast, mutants C152S, C198S, and C209S showed no detectable surface expression (Fig. 9A). Accordingly, we found pronounced perinuclear staining for all mutants, indicating an increased intracellular retention. This finding contrasts the situation in vitro, where refolding appeared to be independent of the cysteine residues. The number of cells positive for intracellular GlyR stains was markedly reduced for C152S, C198S, and C209S (data not shown). Consequently, we found low GlyR immunoreactivity for these mutants in membrane preparations analyzed by Western blots of transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 9B). Finally, the physiological activity of the mutant receptors was measured in whole cell voltage-clamp recordings, applying saturating glycine concentrations (Fig. 9C). As expected from total and surface expression, mutant constructs C41S and C138S, but not C152S, C198S, and C209S were active in electrophysiology. Partially conserved maturation of mutant C41S is in agreement with the in vitro data, which shows that Cys41 is neither involved in disulfide bond formation nor in folding stability of the ECD. Surprisingly, the differences observed between Cys-loop mutants C138S and C152S indicate a functional asymmetry of the single cysteines during maturation of the protein, as substitution of Cys152 exerts a stronger impact on surface accumulation and channel function. To address whether the observed maturation defects resulted from exposure of unpaired cysteines, we generated double mutants C138S/C152S and C198S/C209S. The double mutant C198S/C209S neither showed surface expression nor functionality in electrophysiology, essentially resembling the respective single mutants (Fig. 10). This indicates that intracellular retention did not result from exposed, unpaired cysteines 198 or 209. Likewise, the double mutant C138S/C152S was also retained, exhibiting neither surface expression nor ion channel activity, as observed for C152S but not for C138S. Hence, for surface expression, the mutation C152S is dominant over C138S. These data confirm that intracellular retention did not result from exposure of single unpaired cysteine residues. Based on primary sequence analysis, GlyRs have been predicted to carry both a Cys-loop and a GlyR-specific disulfide bond (24.Grenningloh G. Rienitz A. Schmitt B. Methfessel C. Zensen M. Beyreuther K. Gundelfinger E.D. Betz H. Nature. 1987; 328: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Here, we present experimental evidence for the formation of these disulfide bonds in the recombinant ECD of GlyRα1 and for their role in GlyR biogenesis. Homology modeling of the human GlyRα1 ECD strongly suggested formation of both bonds, as the respective cysteines were directly opposed to each other. To test this hypothesis, we used the refolded ECD as a model for the receptor. Upon refolding under oxidative conditions, the ECD construct gains a native-like fold and attains high affinity strychnine binding (15.Breitinger U. Breitinger H.G. Bauer F. Fahmy K. Glockenhammer D. Becker C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1627-1636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). As evident from glycine displaceable [3H]strychnine binding and strychnine-displaceable [3H]glycine binding, the GlyRα1 ECD carries determinants for both agonist and antagonist recognition (25.Becker C.M. Herken H. Hucho F. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. Springer, Heidelberg1992: 539-575Google Scholar). The purity of the ECD constructs allowed for reproducible detection of tryptic fragments covering nearly the entire sequence of the protein. Upon random disulfide bond formation between the five cysteine residues present, 15 different bonds (10 inter- or intrasubunit and 5 intersubunit bonds) are possible. Of these, only the predicted two disulfide bonds were found. This strongly indicates specificity in the formation of the disulfide bonds. Several lines of evidence confirm the identity of the detected proton adducts. (i) The deviation of the informative signals from the calculated m/z values was below 1 Da. (ii) The signals were detectable under oxidative conditions only, as expected for ions holding a disulfide bond. (iii) The signals were absent from tryptic digests of the respective cysteine mutants. For the GlyR-specific bond, further evidence comes (iv) from the chemical modification of a lysine residue and (v) from the detection of a signal corresponding to a fragment with 3 missed cleavages. This fragment carried an intrapeptide disulfide bond that was readily reduced to obtain the predicted mass shift of +2 Da. We conclude that the GlyR holds both the conserved bond in the Cys-loop between Cys138 and Cys152, as well as the GlyR-specific bond in loop C between Cys198 and Cys209. Single-cysteine mutagenesis did not disturb refolding in vitro, indicating that the overall native fold is not strongly dependent on disulfide bond formation. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed a comparable secondary structure content of both wild-type (15.Breitinger U. Breitinger H.G. Bauer F. Fahmy K. Glockenhammer D. Becker C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1627-1636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and mutant ECDs, indicating that disulfide bond disruption remained without major structural changes. A similar secondary structure distribution was also observed for a chimeric glycine-binding protein, derived from human GlyRα1 and AChBP (26.Liu Z. Ramanoudjame G. Liu D. Fox R.O. Jayaraman V. Kurnikova M. Cascio M. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 9803-9810Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Thus, achieving the overall native-like fold of the isolated GlyRα1 ECD during in vitro refolding appeared to be independent of disulfide bond formation. Curiously, however, the formation of its Cys-loop disulfide bond was dependent on the presence of Cys198 and Cys209 forming the GlyR-specific bond. This suggests that the formation of the GlyR-specific bond leads to a minor conformational shift allowing for the eponymous Cys-loop bond to form. The effect of disulfide bond formation on the function of the GlyR has been studied using reducing and oxidizing agents. The oxidative status of the receptor has no effect on the affinity to strychnine and glycine, but modifies the Hill coefficient of binding (27.Ruiz-Gómez A. Vaello M.L. Valdivieso F. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 559-566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, oxidation and reduction have opposing effects on whole cell currents in rat retinal ganglion cells (28.Pan Z.H. Bähring R. Grantyn R. Lipton S.A. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1384-1391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This finding is contrasted by a recent study detecting no effect of redox agents on glycinergic currents in mouse hippocampal neurons (29.Thio L.L. Zhang H.X. Neuroscience. 2006; 139: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Taken together, no gross reproducible functional defect of surface-expressed receptors was observed with reducing agents. None of these studies, however, determined the oxidative status of the single cysteines after manipulation. By site-directed mutagenesis, we tested the influence of the cysteine residues on receptor expression and function. For mutant C41S, we observed reduced surface expression and activity, indicating that beyond disulfide bond formation, cysteines play important roles in the process of receptor maturation. In contrast to C152S, C138S is to some extent surface-expressed and functional. This discrepancy shows that two cysteines involved in the formation of a single disulfide bond can have different significance for receptor maturation and function. As observed for C152S, mutants C198S and C209S were not only inactive, but also lacked surface expression. This is contrasted by a previous report of a surface-expressed, but inactive, mutant C209S (14.Rajendra S. Vandenberg R.J. Pierce K.D. Cunningham A.M. French P.W. Barry P.H. Schofield P.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2987-2998Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, both studies sustain the hypothesis of functional asymmetry of cysteine residues. In our hands, none of the inactive mutants were surface expressed. Additionally, cysteine mutagenesis might interfere with glycine-gated chloride channel function, i.e. ligand binding or channel open probability, which cannot readily be separated from ion channel biogenesis in heterologous cell expression. Intracellular retention and dysfunctionality of double mutants C138S/C152S and C198S/C209S suggests that exposure of an unpaired cysteine was not the cause for the intracellular retention of the single mutants. Moreover, refolding experiments with mutated constructs showed that the formation of disulfide bonds may be interdependent, even though the overall stability of the fold is not dramatically influenced by bond formation as shown by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Hence, the cysteines seem to have important functions in the maturation of the receptor in vivo that go beyond the formation of disulfide bonds. Eventually, it is tempting to speculate that disulfide bond formation occurs as a late step in folding the ECD. Taken together, this study does not only provide experimental evidence for the formation of both the Cys-loop and the GlyR-specific disulfide bond, but also offers a paradigm for the analysis of the folding mechanism of the ECD.

Evidence exists for rapid, cyclic recruitment of coregulatory complexes upon activation of nuclear receptors. RIP140 is a NR coregulator that represses the transactivation of agonist-bound nuclear receptors. Previously, we showed that RIP140 is inducible by all-trans retinoic acid (RA) and mediates limiting, negative-feedback regulation of retinoid signaling. Methodology and Findings Here we report that in the continued presence of RA, long-paced oscillations of retinoic acid receptor (RAR) activity occur with a period ranging from 24 to 35 hours. Endogenous expression of RIP140 and other RA-target genes also oscillate in the presence of RA. Cyclic retinoid receptor transactivation is ablated by constitutive overexpression of RIP140. Further, depletion of RIP140 disrupts cyclic expression of the RA target gene HOXA5. Evidence is provided that RIP140 may limit RAR signaling in a selective, non-redundant manner in contrast to the classic NR coregulators NCoR1 and SRC1 that are not RA-inducible, do not cycle, and may be partially redundant in limiting RAR activity. Finally, evidence is provided that RIP140 can repress and be induced by other nuclear receptors in a manner that suggests potential participation in other NR oscillations. Conclusions and Significance We provide evidence for novel, long-paced oscillatory retinoid receptor activity and hypothesize that this may be paced in part, by RIP140. Oscillatory NR activity may be involved in mediating hormone actions of physiological and pathological importance."
https://openalex.org/W2126212984,"Rho1 is a small GTPase of the Ras superfamily that serves as the central component in a highly conserved signaling pathway that regulates tissue morphogenesis during development in all animals. Since there is tremendous diversity in the upstream signals that can activate Rho1 as well as the effector molecules that carry out its functions, it is important to define relevant Rho1-interacting genes for each morphogenetic event regulated by this signaling pathway. Previous work from our lab and others has shown that Rho signaling is necessary for the morphogenesis of leg imaginal discs during metamorphosis in Drosophila, although a comprehensive identification of Rho1-interacting genes has not been attempted for this process.We characterized an amorphic allele of Rho1 that displays a poorly penetrant dominant malformed leg phenotype and is capable of being strongly enhanced by Rho1-interacting heterozygous mutations. We then used this allele in a second-site noncomplementation screen with the Exelixis collection of molecularly defined deficiencies to identify Rho1-interacting genes necessary for leg morphogenesis. In a primary screen of 461 deficiencies collectively uncovering approximately 50% of the Drosophila genome, we identified twelve intervals harboring Rho1-interacting genes. Through secondary screening we identified six Rho1-interacting genes including three that were previously identified (RhoGEF2, broad, and stubbloid), thereby validating the screen. In addition, we identified Cdc42, Rheb and Sc2 as novel Rho1-interacting genes involved in adult leg development.This screen identified well-known and novel Rho1-interacting genes necessary for leg morphogenesis, thereby increasing our knowledge of this important signaling pathway. We additionally found that Rheb may have a unique function in leg morphogenesis that is independent of its regulation of Tor."
