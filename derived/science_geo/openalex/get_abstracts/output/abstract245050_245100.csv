https://openalex.org/W2005271847,"FORMATION of the mor type of forest litter, characterized by slow decomposition, has been attributed to a number of factors1–3, but the effect of mycorrhizal fungi, though postulated4,5, has not been studied experimentally. We have conducted an experiment in which root activity and thus mycorrhizal activity were reduced in small areas of an unthinned Pinus radiata stand. The following treatments (three replicates in a randomized block design) were applied to 1 × 1 m plots sited between the trees."

https://openalex.org/W1964289772,"THE aposematically coloured eft stage of the red spotted newt, Notophthalmus viridescens viridescens, is both toxic and noxious to potential predators. The black chinned red salamander, Pseudotriton ruber schencki, is the most common red-orange salamander other than eft N. v. viridescens in the vicinity of the Highlands Biological Station in North Carolina. This study provides experimental evidence that P. r. schencki is a Batesian mimic of N. v. viridescens."

https://openalex.org/W2043324941,"NITROGENASE, which contains iron, molybdenum and thiol groups, operates in an aqueous environment. Many attempts have been made to produce chemical models for nitrogenase based on the above knowledge and recently Schrauzer and co-workers have described dinitrogen-reducing systems of this type1,2 but they use high pressures of dinitrogen (135 atm) and obtain only 3 to 5 μmol. of ammonia from mmol quantities of reagents2 (see Table 1, example 1)."
