https://openalex.org/W2023475409,THE biological action of beryllium salts has lately aroused interest among embryologists1–3 and pathologists4. We have investigated the effect of beryllium (sulphate) acting for one to four days on tissue cultures of connective tissue and skeletal muscles (chick embryos). The final concentration varied from M/400 to M/106.

https://openalex.org/W1992808430,"A CONSIDERATION of the energetics of radioactive decay shows that two isotopes of the same mass number but neighbouring atomic number cannot both be stable if the rest mass of the neutrino is zero. A number of such neighbouring isobaric pairs exists in Nature; in some cases the expected radioactivity has been found in one member of the pair, with a period of decay comparable to, or longer than, the age of the earth (for example, the well-known case of 4019K). The two naturally existing isotopes of indium—11349In and 11549In (abundances 4.5 and 94.5 per cent respectively)—are each members of such isobaric pairs, the first with 11348Cd, and the second with 11550Sn. Accordingly, it was decided to search for radioactivity among these elements, as none had hitherto been found."

https://openalex.org/W2075223199,"IN order to test the hypothesis (unpublished) that the habit-forming properties of certain drugs might be due to their ability to induce adaptive changes in the enzyme systems of cells and tissues, we have made comparative studies of the effects of cocaine on the respiration and fermentation of pure strains of yeasts, previously grown in the presence and in the absence of cocaine. A detailed report of this work will be published elsewhere. In brief, we find that cocaine in 0.004 M concentration depresses the respiration (Torulopsis utilis, var. major, type No. 6593) and the ferment ation (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, type No. 815) of the washed cells in glucose and phosphate buffer at pH 7.0, but is without effect at pH 6.0. Some degree of tolerance towards the drug appears to be established, as the depressant effect is less with cells that had been grown in the presence of cocaine."

https://openalex.org/W2058843697,"In view of current interest in the problem of free or restricted internal rotation in molecules, we may mention briefly some results which indicate free rotation of methyl groups about the Cd—C bond in cadmium dimethyl. We have already described1 measurements on the rotational fine structure of some vibrational bands of zinc dimethyl and mercury dimethyl, which provided strong evidence for such free internal rotation in these molecules. The infrared absorption spectrum of cadmium dimethyl has now been measured with greater resolving power than that previously used by Gutowsky2, particularly in the region of 3 µ."

According to Read and Haas3, they possess inhibiting action on trypsin and the proteinase of taka-diastase, but not on papain or bromelin."
https://openalex.org/W2052916019,"IN a communication in Nature of February 10, Plomley, Higgins and Hayes describe the dependence of viscosity and rate of gelation on pH. Their results are in general agreement with those obtained in this laboratory for lactic casein and denatured peanut protein spinning dopes; dopes to be spun into fibres must obviously have considerable stability to allow time for filtration and de-aeration."
https://openalex.org/W2059743065,"THE histochemical test of McManus1 and Hotchkiss2 demonstrating the presence of mucopolysaccharides, mucoproteins and glycoproteins Was carried out on cancerous tissue of the vagina, portio and corpus uteri, the Fallopian tube and the ovary. The polygonal stratum of the normal epithelium of the portio gives an intense positive test, while the normal stratum basale remains uncoloured. Cancerous tissue fails to give a positive test even in the pre-invasive intra-epithelial stage. The same result was obtained in cancers originating from other parts of the genital tract. Thus our observations indicate that the McManus–Hotchkiss test is a valuable tool in the early diagnosis of cancers in the pre-invasive stage."

https://openalex.org/W2026693032,THE following general conclusions emerge from the extensive work on the alcoholysis of substituted benzoyl chlorides1: (a) the changes in velocity constant with substituents are similar in all the various solvents used; (b) these changes fully support the contention that the reaction is a bimolecular SN2 process.
https://openalex.org/W2052864824,"ONE well-known application of the concept of ionic-covalent resonance is in the field of dipole moments, where it has been used, in a simple way, to correlate the observed dipole moments of bonds with differences in electronegativity1. However, recent work, notably that of Mulliken2, Coulson3, and Robinson4, has cast doubt upon the validity of some of the assumptions made in this treatment5. One of these assumptions is that the dipole moment of a pure covalent bond is approximately zero."
https://openalex.org/W1967107059,"PARTIAL acetylation as a means of arresting the development of the yellow to brown colour, produced by photochemical reactions on irradiating bleached jute with a mercury vapour lamp, has been suggested by Peill1, and Callow and Speakman2. The development of this undesirable shade in untreated and bleached jute has been postulated by the latter as mainly due to a sequence of reactions involving the lignin molecule, presumably through the formation of o-phenols and subsequent conversion to o-quinones. These authors are also of opinion that some discoloration may be caused by the polymerization of furfural liberated from pentosans, or result from condensation reactions between furfural and phenolic groups of lignin. On acetylation, however, the phenolic and alcoholic hydroxyl groups in jute are blocked, and consequently the possibility of the above reactions leading to discoloration is avoided."
