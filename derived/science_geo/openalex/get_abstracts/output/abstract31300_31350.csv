https://openalex.org/W2064761203,"Phosphate esters and anhydrides dominate the living world but are seldom used as intermediates by organic chemists. Phosphoric acid is specially adapted for its role in nucleic acids because it can link two nucleotides and still ionize; the resulting negative charge serves both to stabilize the diesters against hydrolysis and to retain the molecules within a lipid membrane. A similar explanation for stability and retention also holds for phosphates that are intermediary metabolites and for phosphates that serve as energy sources. Phosphates with multiple negative charges can react by way of the monomeric metaphosphate ion PO3- as an intermediate. No other residue appears to fulfill the multiple roles of phosphate in biochemistry. Stable, negatively charged phosphates react under catalysis by enzymes; organic chemists, who can only rarely use enzymatic catalysis for their reactions, need more highly reactive intermediates than phosphates."
https://openalex.org/W2140178603,"In initial attempts to define the molecular events responsible for the latent state of herpes simplex virus, in situ hybridization was utilized to search for virally encoded RNA transcripts in latently infected sensory neurons. The use of cloned probes representing the entire viral genome indicated that transcripts encoded within terminal repeats were present. When the alpha genes encoding ICP-0, ICP-4, and ICP-27 and the gamma 1 gene encoding VP-5 were employed, only RNA transcripts hybridizing to the ICP-0 probe were detected. In latently infected cells, the ICP-0--related transcripts were localized principally in the nucleus; this was not the case in acutely (productively) infected neurons or in neurons probed for RNA transcripts coding for actin. In Northern blotting experiments, an RNA of 2.6 kilobases was detected with the ICP-0 probe. When single-stranded DNAs from the ICP-0 region were used as probes, RNA from the strand complementary to that encoding ICP-0 messenger RNA (mRNA) was the major species detected. This RNA species may play a significant role in maintaining the latent infection."

https://openalex.org/W1970930845,"The capacity of purified I-Ad, I-Ed, I-Ak, and I-Ek to bind to protein derived peptides that have been previously reported to be T cell immunogens has been examined. For each of the 12 peptides studied strong binding to the relevant Ia restriction element was observed. All the peptides bound more than one Ia molecule; however, for 11 of 12 peptides, the dominant binding was to the restriction element, whereas in one instance the dominant binding was to a nonrestriction element. When the peptides were used to inhibit the presentation of antigen by prefixed accessory cells to T cells, an excellent correlation was found between the capacity of a peptide to inhibit the binding of an antigen to purified Ia and the capacity of the peptide to inhibit accessory cell presentation of the antigen. Thus, the binding of peptide to purified Ia is immunologically relevant, and Ia seems to be the only saturable molecule on the surface of the accessory cell involved in antigen presentation. Inhibition analysis also indicated that all peptides restricted to a particular Ia molecule competitively inhibited one another, suggesting that each Ia restriction element has a single binding site for antigen. Cross-linking of labeled peptides to Ia followed by electrophoretic analysis and autoradiography suggested that this single binding site is made up of portions of both alpha and beta chains of Ia."

https://openalex.org/W1966778781,"Ribonuclease mitochondrial RNA processing, a site-specific endoribonuclease involved in primer RNA metabolism in mammalian mitochondria, requires an RNA component for its activity. On the basis of copurification and selective inactivation with complementary oligonucleotides, a 135-nucleotide RNA species, not encoded in the mitochondrial genome, is identified as the RNA moiety of the endoribonuclease. This finding implies transport of a nucleus-encoded RNA, essential for organelle DNA replication, to the mitochondrial matrix."

https://openalex.org/W1966668708,"Azidothymidine and ribavirin both inhibit replication of human immunodeficiency virus in vitro and show promise of clinical utility in patients infected with this virus. In this study, the possible interactions of these drugs were examined in vitro, and a reproducible antagonism between azidothymidine and ribavirin was found to occur under a variety of experimental conditions. The mechanism responsible for this antagonism appeared to be inhibition of azidothymidine phosphorylation by ribavirin. Because similar effects may occur in vivo, clinical trials of these two drugs in combination must be performed only under carefully controlled conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2054698682,"The circumsporozoite (CS) protein of Plasmodium falciparum is the focus of intense efforts to develop an antisporozoite malaria vaccine. Localization of sites for T-cell recognition on this molecule is critical for vaccine design. By using an algorithm designed to predict T-cell sites and a large panel of H-2 congenic mice, a major nonrepetitive T-cell site was located. When a synthetic peptide corresponding to this site was covalently linked to the major B-cell site on the molecule, an immunogen capable of eliciting a high-titer antibody response was formed. This peptide sequence could prime helper T cells for a secondary response to the intact CS protein. The new helper T-cell site is located outside the repetitive region of the CS protein and appears to be the immunodominant T site on the molecule. This approach should be useful in the rational design and construction of vaccines."

https://openalex.org/W1596401901,"Transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II from the adenovirus major late promoter was studied in vitro in a nuclear extract derived from HeLa cells. We found that different concentrations of Sarkosyl blocked transcription initiation at several different functional steps. These corresponded to two steps defined previously in a partially purified transcription system: formation of the rapid start complex, which required incubation of template with the extract and was blocked by Sarkosyl concentrations greater than 0.025%, and productive initiation, which occurred upon addition of nucleotides and was prevented by Sarkosyl concentrations greater than 0.1%. We used assays based on these findings to probe further the events that comprise the processes of initiation and reinitiation of transcription from the major late promoter. We found that the templates used in the first round of initiations from preformed rapid start complexes were more actively transcribed in the second round of initiations than newly added templates. We argued that the most likely explanation for this observation was that some transcription component(s) remained committed to the promoter after formation of an elongation complex. This template-committed complex must have been distinct from the rapid start complex, because reinitiation and rapid start complex formation were both blocked by 0.025% Sarkosyl."

https://openalex.org/W1525883576,"Antibodies against synthetic peptides derived from the cDNA sequence of interferon-induced 2',5'-oligo(A) synthetase, and which immunoprecipitate the native enzyme activity, were found to detect multiple enzyme forms in denaturing electrophoretic immunoblots. In some human cell lines, four different interferon-induced proteins of 40, 46, 67, and 100 kDa were found to react with the same peptide antibodies. Each isolated form was shown to have 2',5'-oligo(A) synthetase activity, but the dependence on double-stranded RNA was markedly different for activation of the individual enzymes. The four enzyme forms also differ in their intracellular localization, on microsomes (100 kDa), in nuclei (67, 46, 40 kDa), and on membrane structures (67 kDa). Plasma membranes from interferon-treated Daudi lymphoblastoid cells are highly enriched in the 67-kDa 2',5'-oligo(A) synthetase form. The 2',5'-oligo(A) synthetase activity induced by interferons in human cells appears, therefore, as a complex multienzyme system."
https://openalex.org/W2000474886,"A clonal cell line (ALC) derived from murine bone marrow stroma is capable of supporting the continuous, in vitro growth of early lymphoid and myeloid cell populations. The growth-promoting effects of ALC are in part mediated through M-CSF and a pre-B cell growth factor, both of which accumulate in ALC-culture supernatant. To analyze the lymphoid growth factor produced by ALC cells, we derived a pre-B cell indicator line that is dependent on ALC-growth-conditioned medium. Using a combination of biological and biochemical analyses, we have established that the pre-B cell growth factor produced by ALC cells is distinct from IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, and IL-4 (BSF-1), suggesting that the early stages of B-cell development are regulated by a unique stroma-derived growth factor."
https://openalex.org/W1503573373,"We have studied the interactions of single-stranded polyribonucleotides with murine leukemia virus structural proteins p10, p10' (a p10 variant), and Pr65gag, as well as Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) pp12 (a p10 analog). Two quantitative assays have been used to monitor protein-RNA association: the fluorescence enhancement of polyethenoadenylic acid) poly(epsilon A) upon binding protein, and tryptophan fluorescence quenching upon binding to poly(U). With each assay p10 was shown to bind stoichiometrically to single-stranded RNA, covering a length of nucleic acid chain (occluded site size, n) of about 6 residues. RSV pp12 was also shown to bind to poly(epsilon A), with n = 5 +/- 1. Addition of NaCl to fully titrated MuLV p10-nucleic acid mixtures effected nearly complete restoration of poly(epsilon A) or MuLV p10 fluorescence. Under conditions of 0.06 M NaCl, p10 bound noncooperatively to poly(epsilon A) with an intrinsic association constant, K = 2.3 X 10(6) M-1. K and n determined in this study were shown to relate to Kapp determined by other methods, by the approximation Kapp approximately NK, where N is the number of binding sites along the polynucleotide chain ((nucleotides/chain)/n). Chemical modifications of the p10 cysteine residues did not alter the affinity for poly(epsilon A). The affinity of Pr65gag for poly(epsilon A) appears to be higher than that of p10."
https://openalex.org/W1567981986,"We describe experiments showing that the 5'-flanking region of the human alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) gene contains transcription control elements with characteristics of enhancers. The enhancer activity was detected and characterized by the ability to direct the expression of a linked chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene in transfected AFP-producing hepatoma cells in culture. The enhancer activity is cell-specific in that it occurs in hepatoma cells producing AFP, but not in non-AFP-producing hepatoma or nonhepatic cells. The active elements can direct CAT expression in conjunction with the SV40 promoter in an orientation- and position-independent manner. The sequences important for enhancer activity reside in the 400-base pair region between 3.3 and 3.7 kilobase pairs upstream of the AFP gene. This and proximal upstream regions contain multiple enhancer core-like sequences and other stretches of potential biological significance."

https://openalex.org/W1546078475,"The relationship between fMet-Leu-Phe-induced changes in the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration [( Ca2+]i), plasma membrane potential depolarization, and metabolic responses was studied in human neutrophils. Receptor-activated depolarization occurred both at high and resting [Ca2+]i, but was inhibited at very low [Ca2+]i. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced plasma membrane depolarization, on the contrary, was independent of [Ca2+]i. The threshold fMet-Leu-Phe concentration for plasma membrane depolarization (10(-8) M) was at least 1 log unit higher than that for [Ca2+]i increases (5 X 10(-10) M) and coincident with that for NADPH oxidase activation. Nearly maximal [Ca2+]i increases were elicited by 3 X 10(-9) fMet-Leu-Phe in the absence of any significant plasma membrane potential change. This observation allowed us to investigate the effects of artificially induced plasma membrane depolarization and hyperpolarization at low fMet-Leu-Phe concentrations (10(-9) to 3 X 10(-9) M) which did not perturb plasma membrane potential. Depolarizing (gramicidin D at 10(-7) to 10(-6) M or KCl at 50 mM) and hyperpolarizing (valinomycin at 4 microM) treatments had little influence on unstimulated [Ca2+]i levels, whereas fMet-Leu-Phe-induced transients were significantly altered. Gramicidin D and KCl decreased the fMet-Leu-Phe-induced [Ca2+]i increases in Ca2+-containing or in Ca2+-free media. Valinomycin, on the contrary, increased receptor-stimulated [Ca2+]i increases, and the effect was larger in the presence of extracellular Ca2+. Valinomycin also strongly potentiated secretion. It is suggested that plasma membrane depolarization in human neutrophils is a physiological feedback mechanism inhibiting receptor-dependent [Ca2+]i changes."
https://openalex.org/W2142143883,"Seven polypeptides highly toxic to mice were isolated from the venom of the scorpion, Centruroides suffusus suffusus (Css), and their chemical and toxic properties were characterized. It was shown that the most active toxins by intracerebroventricular injection are less active when injected subcutaneously. The complete amino acid sequence (66 residues) of toxin II (Css II) has been determined. The C-terminal end is amidated as found for most other scorpion toxins. Css II is a beta-type toxin, previously used to define the binding site for activation of the sodium channel. Using rat brain synaptosomes, we demonstrated that all Css toxins compete with 125I-Css II to bind to site 4 and should be considered as beta-scorpion toxins. Specific binding parameters for Css VI, one of the most active toxins, were determined: KD = 100 pM; capacity in binding sites, 2.2 pmol of toxin/mg of synaptosomal protein. Css VI was shown to inhibit gamma-aminobutyric acid uptake by synaptosomes: K 0.5 = 100 pM, which agrees with its KD. Competition experiments between the seven Css toxins and 125I-Css II for antiserum raised against Css II demonstrated that all these toxins have common antigenic properties."

https://openalex.org/W1486289471,"The expression of the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) on the cell surface entails a complex biosynthetic pathway, involving the expression and assembly of four subunits. The amount of AChR on the cell surface changes throughout muscle development and upon muscle denervation. We have examined the regulatory role of transcript levels on surface AChR expression by RNA blot analysis. During myogenesis of the fusing mouse muscle cell line C2, which expresses an embryonic type of receptor, changes in the rate of appearance of cell surface AChR have been assayed by 125I-alpha-bungarotoxin binding. The maximal increase in the rate of appearance of cell surface AChR occurs upon cell fusion, closely following the maximal increase in transcript levels for the alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-AChR subunits. AChR alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-subunit gene transcript levels have also been examined in innervated and denervated rat and mouse muscle. Muscle denervation results in an increase of transcripts for all four subunits. However, the amount of beta-subunit transcript in innervated rat skeletal muscle is high relative to the other subunit transcripts, and increases less than the other subunit transcripts upon denervation. Our results indicate that, during myogenesis and upon denervation, the availability of AChR subunit transcripts for translation plays a regulatory role in surface AChR appearance."
https://openalex.org/W1530384242,"The Gal alpha 1-3Gal structural determinant has been found to have a unique distribution in mammals. Although this determinant is abundantly expressed by erythrocytes and nucleated cells of many mammals, it has not been detected in human cells. However, our previous studies (Galili, U., Rachmilewitz, E. A., Peleg, A., and Flechner, I. (1984) J. Exp. Med. 160, 1519-1531; Galili, U., Clark, M. R., and Shohet, S. B. (1986) J. Clin. Invest. 77, 27-33) have suggested that this epitope is present in small amounts and may be involved in immune-mediated destruction of senescent human erythrocytes. To have a means for exploring this possibility and for studying the species and tissue distribution of this epitope we have raised a monoclonal antibody (Gal-13) which specifically binds to glycoconjugates with a nonreducing terminal Gal alpha 1-3Gal disaccharide. Mice were immunized with rabbit erythrocytes, which express an abundance of glycoconjugates with Gal alpha 1-3Gal epitopes. Clones were screened with a solid-phase binding assay (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) for antibodies which bound to ceramide pentahexoside (Gal alpha 1-3Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-3-Gal beta Gal beta 1-4Glc1-1Cer) but not to ceramide trihexoside (Gal alpha 1-4Gal beta 1-4Glc1-1Cer). Gal-13 bound to a number of neutral glycosphingolipids from rabbit and bovine erythrocytes. These glycosphingolipids have previously been shown to be a family of linear and branched polylactosamine structures, which have non-reducing terminal Gal alpha 1-3Gal epitopes. The antibody did not bind to the human blood group B glycolipid, Gal alpha 1-3(Fuc alpha 1-2)Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4Glc1-1Cer, and, therefore, branching at the penultimate galactose blocks Gal-13 binding. However, after removal of the fucose from the B antigen Gal-13 recognized the resulting derivative. Other Gal alpha 1-3Gal glycosphingolipids with an isogloboside or globoside core structure were not recognized by Gal-13 suggesting that the antibody binds to Gal alpha 1-3Gal carried by a lactosamine core structure. Gal-13 has been used to demonstrate that the Gal alpha 1-3Gal ceramide pentahexoside has been evolutionarily conserved in red cells of animals up to the stage of New World monkeys but is not found in Old World monkey red cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W2041694732,"A voltage-dependent potassium current (the delayed rectifier) has been found in murine B cells and their precursors with the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. The type of channel involved in the generation of this current appears to be present throughout all stages of pre-B-cell differentiation, since it is detected in pre-B cell lines infected with Abelson murine leukemia virus; these cell lines represent various phases of B-cell development. Thus, the presence of this channel is not obviously correlated with B-cell differentiation. Although blocked by Co2+, the channel, or channels, does not appear to be activated by Ca2+ entry. It is, however, inactivated by high intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. In addition, elevation of intracellular adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate induces at all potentials a rapid decrease in the peak potassium conductance and increased rates of activation and inactivation. Therefore, potassium channels can be physiologically modulated by second messengers in lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1653193131,"Synthesis of surfactant-associated glycoprotein of Mr = 30,000-35,000 (SAP-35) was induced in explant culture of human fetal lung obtained from 8 to 24 weeks of gestation. SAP-35 synthesis and content increased markedly during 1-5 days in organ culture in association with the morphologic maturation of Type II epithelial cells and the appearance of lamellar bodies. [35S] Methionine labeling of the explants and subsequent immunoprecipitation of SAP-35 demonstrated distinct high-mannose precursors and sialylated SAP-35 forms as early in culture as SAP-35 synthesis was detectable. The increase in SAP-35 synthesis was associated with increased SAP-35 RNA of 2.1 kilobases as assessed by hybridization assay with [32P]cDNA specific for human SAP-35. Specific SAP-35 RNA increased during organ culture and both SAP-35 content and SAP-35 RNA increased in the absence of exogenous hormones in 2% carbon-stripped fetal calf serum. SAP-35 content and synthesis was stimulated by 8-Br-cAMP. Addition of 100 microM 8-Br-cAMP, enhanced both the concentration of SAP-35 protein and the SAP-35 RNA as assessed by hybridization assay. In contrast, treatment of the explants with dexamethasone was associated with decreased SAP-35 protein synthesis, SAP-35 content, and decreased SAP-35 RNA levels compared to untreated explants. Inhibition by dexamethasone occurred at all gestational ages tested, was dose-dependent, and detectable within 24-48 h during organ culture. Dexamethasone significantly inhibited both basal and cAMP-induced SAP-35 synthesis. Induction of pulmonary surfactant protein (SAP-35) synthesis during organ culture of human fetal lung was associated with increased SAP-35 RNA. SAP-35 synthesis and SAP-35 RNA were inhibited by dexamethasone and enhanced cAMP."

https://openalex.org/W2085301595,"Reverse transcriptase activity of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was blocked in vitro by immunoglobulin G (IgG) derived from certain individuals infected with this retrovirus. A heterogeneous immune response for inhibition of enzyme function was noted. Catalytic activity was depressed by 50% or more with the use of 10 micrograms of IgG from 11 of 16 HIV-seropositive asymptomatic carriers, but from 0 of 8 seronegative controls and 2 of 12 patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or the AIDS-related complex (ARC). The inhibitor was confined to the F(ab′)2 fragment. It was not directed against the poly(rA) ⋅ oligo(dT) template, nor against major envelope or structural viral antigens, and did not cross-react with bacterial, avian, or other mammalian DNA polymerases. It did not correlate with recognition of polymerase antigens by radioimmunoprecipitation. Loss of this inhibitor may be associated with development of clinical disease. Ten asymptomatic HIV-seropositive carriers with high titers of IgG antibodies to reverse transcriptase were followed for a mean of 3 years. All of four lost inhibitory capability prior to development of AIDS or ARC, while titers persist in the six who remain clinically healthy."

https://openalex.org/W2106872887,"We show here that the interaction of a radiation leukemia virus-induced thymoma, C6VL, with its cognate retroviruses occurs in the vicinity of the T cell receptor (TCR). While an anti-clonotypic antibody completely inhibits this interaction, antibodies specific for another T cell receptor complex determinant, L3T4, only partially inhibit the cell-retrovirus interaction. Several antibodies to more abundant cell-surface determinants (T200, Ly15, H-2Db) do not inhibit this interaction. Under capping conditions, either of the antibodies to L3T4 or TCR epitopes modulate virus binding receptors from the surface of C6VL/1 cells. L3T4 and the TCR do not comodulate significantly on the surface of C6VL/1 cells. These experimental findings implicate the existence of rare TCR-L3T4 complexes on C6VL/1 cells, and the involvement of these complexes in the binding of C6VL/1 to its cognate retrovirus. In addition, the clonotypic anti-TCR antibody inhibits C6VL/1 cell proliferation at concentrations that block its binding to its produced retroviruses."
https://openalex.org/W2089747781,"It is a generally accepted principle of biology that a protein's primary sequence is the main determinant of its tertiary structure. However, the mechanism by which a protein proceeds from an unfolded, disordered state to a folded, relatively well-ordered, native conformation is obscure. Studies have been initiated to examine the ""genetics"" of protein folding, with mutants of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) being used to explore the nature of the specific intramolecular interactions that direct this process. Previous work with BPTI chemically modified at cysteines 14 and 38 indicated that transient disulfide bond formation by these residues contributed to efficient folding at 25 degrees C. In the present work, mutants of BPTI in which these cysteines were replaced by alanines or threonines were made and the mutant proteins were produced by a heterologous Escherichia coli expression system. At 25 degrees C in vitro, the refolding behavior of these mutants was characterized by a pronounced lag. However, when expressed at 37 degrees C in E. coli, or when refolded at 37 degrees or 52 degrees C in vitro, the mutant proteins folded readily into the native conformation, albeit at a rate somewhat slower than that exhibited by wild-type BPTI. These results indicate that, at physiological temperatures, BPTI lacking cysteines 14 and 38 can refold quantitatively."
https://openalex.org/W1552134985,"alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) is a major constituent of embryonal plasma and a physiological carrier of free fatty acids. The purpose of the present work was to study the mechanism by which fatty acids bound to AFP are transferred to living cells. Radiolabeled rat AFP and arachidonic acid were used to follow up the uptake and metabolism of both the protein and the fatty acid by rhabdomyosarcoma cells isolated from a nickel-induced rat tumor. Time course uptake of AFP and arachidonic acid by these cells exhibited a saturable profile at both 4 and 37 degrees C. A diffusible nonsaturable uptake of arachidonic acid was observed in experiments at both 4 and 37 degrees C with preparations of fixed AFP content and increased molar amounts of arachidonic acid (up to 8-fold molar excess). On the contrary, saturable binding and uptake of fatty acid and protein were evidenced when the molar ratio of arachidonic to AFP was fixed at 0.5, and the concentration of both increased simultaneously. This suggests that, under physiological conditions (low fatty acid to AFP ratio), the uptake of arachidonic acid by the tumor cells is regulated by the protein. Fatty acid distribution in cell lipids after 2 and 24 h of culture at 37 degrees C, in the presence of arachidonic acid bound to AFP, revealed that this fatty acid was mainly incorporated in cell phospholipids. At 4 degrees C, however, the totality of cell-associated arachidonic acid was in the unesterified form. Pulse-chase experiments showed that about 25 and 40% of the AFP initially taken up by cells were released undegraded after 6 and 60 min, respectively. Under the same conditions, nearly all the arachidonic acid remained in the cells. Taken together, these facts suggest a two-receptor model for the physiological uptake of fatty acids. The AFP binds to an AFP receptor and the fatty acid is then removed and transported inside the cell by a specific fatty acid-binding protein."

https://openalex.org/W1995833227,"Many RNAs are complex, globular molecules formed from elements of secondary and tertiary structure analogous to those found in proteins. Little is known about recognition of RNAs by proteins. In the case of transfer RNAs (tRNAs), considerable evidence suggests that elements dispersed in both the one- and three-dimensional structure are important for recognition by aminoacyl tRNA synthetases. Fragments of alanine tRNA synthetase were created by in vitro manipulations of the cloned alaS gene and examined for their interaction with alanine-specific tRNA. Sequences essential for recognition were located near the middle of the polypeptide, juxtaposed to the carboxyl-terminal side of the domain for aminoacyl adenylate synthesis. The most essential part of the tRNA interaction strength and specificity was dependent on a sequence of fewer than 100 amino acids. Within this sequence, and in the context of the proper conformation, a segment of no more than 17 amino acids was responsible for 25% or more of the total synthetase-tRNA free energy of association. The results raise the possibility that an important part of specific RNA recognition by an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase involves a polypeptide segment that is short relative to the total size of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W2072943231,"Under the influence of estrogen, uterine smooth muscle becomes highly excitable, generating spontaneous and prolonged bursts of action potentials. In a study of the mechanisms by which this transition in excitability occurs, polyadenylated RNA from the uteri of estrogen-treated rats was injected into Xenopus oocytes. The injected oocytes expressed a novel voltage-dependent potassium current. This current was not observed in oocytes injected with RNA from several other excitable tissues, including rat brain and uterine smooth muscle from ovariectomized rats not treated with estrogen. The activation of this current on depolarization was exceptionally slow, particularly for depolarizations from relatively negative membrane potentials. Such a slowly activating channel may play an important role in the slow, repetitive bursts of action potentials in the myometrium."
https://openalex.org/W1610481818,"The murine Leydig tumor cell line, MLTC-1, has a gonadotropin-responsive adenylate cyclase system. Binding of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) stimulates the accumulation of cyclic AMP in these cells. Chemically deglycosylated hCG (DG-hCG) is an antagonist that binds with high affinity to the gonadotropin receptor, but fails to stimulate adenylate cyclase. This antagonism can be reversed if the binding of DG-hCG is followed by treatment of the DG-hCG-receptor complex with antibodies against hCG. Polyclonal antibodies against DG-hCG were raised in rabbits. These antibodies were strongly cross-reactive with hCG, bound to both the alpha- and beta-subunits of hCG and DG-hCG, and reversed the antagonism of DG-hCG. The antiserum was divided into two fractions by affinity chromatography on hCG-Sepharose. The fraction that was not retained reacted only with DG-hCG (DG-hCG antibodies) and, on Western blots, bound to both the alpha- and beta-subunits of DG-hCG. DG-hCG antibodies did not reverse the antagonism of DG-hCG. However, using 125I-protein A, we were able to detect binding of these antibodies to the cell surface DG-hCG-receptor complex. The fraction of antibodies retained by the affinity column reacted with both DG-hCG and hCG (DG-hCG/hCG antibodies). On Western blots, DG-hCG/hCG antibodies bound to the beta-subunit, but only weakly to the alpha-subunit of both hCG and DG-hCG. These antibodies also bound to the cell surface DG-hCG-receptor complex. In addition, DG-hCG/hCG antibodies were able reverse the antagonism of DG-hCG. Reversal of DG-hCG antagonism by the whole antiserum was blocked by the beta- but not the alpha-subunit of hCG. Polyclonal antiserum against the beta- but not the alpha-subunit of hCG reversed the antagonism of DG-hCG. From these results, we conclude that antibody binding to specific determinants common to both native and deglycosylated beta-subunit reverses the antagonism of DG-hCG. In addition, antibodies directed against unique determinants on the deglycosylated beta-subunit are not capable of reversing the antagonism of DG-hCG."
https://openalex.org/W1482793283,"Modulation of ion channels is an essential step for understanding the regulation of cellular functions. 1,4-Dihydropyridines (nitrendipine, nifedipine, PN 200-110, etc.) are potent inhibitors of voltage-dependent calcium channels and are important therapeutic agents in the treatment of various cardiovascular disorders such as angina and cardiac arrhythmias. In this work a new procedure is employed to determine the density of surface dihydropyridine receptors in contracting muscle cells in culture. Activation of endogenous protein kinase C (the Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) by the tumor promoter phorbol-12-myristate or 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol enhanced the number of dihydropyridine receptors without significant change in the receptor affinity. The increase in the number of receptors was associated with stimulation of the dihydropyridine-sensitive 45Ca uptake as well as activation of protein kinase C in myotubes treated with phorbol esters. These data strongly suggest that activation of protein kinase C promotes the appearance of dihydropyridine receptors in the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1555486128,"The regulatory role of the allosteric site of CTP synthetase on flux through the enzyme in situ and on pyrimidine nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) pool balance was investigated using a mutant mouse T lymphoblast (S49) cell line which contains a CTP synthetase refractory to complete inhibition by CTP. Measurements of [3H]uridine incorporation into cellular pyrimidine NTP pools as a function of time indicated that CTP synthesis in intact wild type cells was markedly inhibited in a cooperative fashion by small increases in CTP pools, whereas flux across the enzyme in mutant cells was much less affected by changes in CTP levels. The cooperativity of the allosteric inhibition of the enzyme was greater in situ than in vitro. Exogenous manipulation of levels of GTP, an activator of the enzyme, indicated that GTP had a moderate effect on enzyme activity in situ, and changes in pools of ATP, a substrate of the enzyme, had small effects on CTP synthetase activity. The consequences of incubation with actinomycin D, cycloheximide, dibutyryl cyclic AMP, and 6-azauridine on the flux across CTP synthetase and on NTP pools differed considerably between wild type and mutant cells. Under conditions of growth arrest, an intact binding site for CTP on CTP synthetase was required to maintain a balance between the CTP and UTP pools in wild type cells. Moreover, wild type cells failed to incorporate H14CO3- into pyrimidine pools following growth arrest. In contrast, mutant cells incorporated the radiolabel at a high rate indicating loss of a regulatory function. These results indicated that uridine nucleotides are important regulators of pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis in mouse S49 cells, and CTP regulates the balance between UTP and CTP pools."
https://openalex.org/W1546658436,"The same factors that regulate the activation of purified hepatic soluble guanylate cyclase by diverse agents possessing distinct requirements for enzyme activation were found to modulate cyclic GMP formation in intact viable hepatic cells. A comparison was made between activation of heme-deficient or heme-reconstituted guanylate cyclase and stimulation of cyclic GMP formation in mouse hepatic slices that were 95% viable and showed no active efflux of cyclic GMP. Heme-dependent activators of guanylate cyclase elicited a greater -fold increase in hepatic cyclic GMP levels in slices from phenobarbital-pretreated than control mice. Brilliant cresyl blue and KCN inhibited both enzyme activation and hepatic cyclic GMP accumulation caused by agents that generate nitric oxide. Hepatic slices from 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine-treated mice, which are known to develop sharp increases in hepatic protoporphyrin IX/heme concentration ratios, showed elevated resting cyclic GMP levels whereas phenobarbital pretreatment produced decreased resting cyclic GMP levels compared to controls. Guanylate cyclase activation by azide required added catalase, and both enzyme activation and hepatic cyclic GMP formation were inhibited by aminotriazole. Enzyme activation by glyceryl trinitrate and NaNO2 required added thiols. Hepatic slices from acetaminophen-pretreated mice showed marked depletion of sulfhydryls and decreased cyclic GMP formation in response to these enzyme activators. Both effects were completely restored by treatment of thiol-depleted mice with N-acetylcysteine. These observations lend support to the general view that information gained from studies on the regulatory properties of purified soluble guanylate cyclase bears a close relationship to studies on regulatory mechanisms that modulate cyclic GMP formation in intact cells."
https://openalex.org/W1482124411,"We have compared the reactions of trypsin with human alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M), and three rat plasma protease inhibitors, alpha 1-macroglobulin (alpha 1M), alpha 1-inhibitor III (alpha 1I3), and alpha 2M. All four of these proteins appear to contain reactive thiol esters. The electrophoretic mobility in agarose gels of human and rat alpha 2M is increased by 1 mol of trypsin, while the mobility of alpha 1M and alpha 1I3 is decreased. Treatment with methylamine causes similar mobility changes, except in the case of rat alpha 2M. Titration of human and rat macroglobulins by repeated small additions of trypsin and by assay of liberated SH groups or enhanced ligand fluorescence revealed a stoichiometry of about 1 mol of trypsin/mol of inhibitor. In contrast, addition of macroglobulin to a fixed amount of trypsin and detection of residual amidase or protease activity revealed a stoichiometry of about 2 mol of trypsin for 1 mol of human alpha 2M, about 1.4 mol for rat alpha 1M, and about 1 mol for rat alpha 2M. One mol of trypsin reacted with 2 or more mol of alpha 1I3 by the criteria of SH groups liberated or protease inhibition. Methylamine-treated rat alpha 2M binds a significant amount of trypsin releasing about 2 mol of SH. Radioactive beta-trypsin was covalently bound to subunits of the purified plasma inhibitors. The Mr of the labeled products with rat and human alpha 2M had molecular weights which suggested trypsin was bound to intact as well as cleaved subunit chains and also to multiple chains via cross-linking. Rat alpha 1M also produced a product which may be an intact subunit alpha chain plus trypsin. Greater than 80% of the trypsin was bound covalently to these inhibitors at low molar ratios."

https://openalex.org/W1578221299,"Alpha 1-macroglobulin was purified from rat plasma by gel filtration (Sephacryl S-300) and ion exchange chromatography (DE52). Analysis of the purified alpha 1-macroglobulin by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed two polypeptides: a light chain which could be resolved into a double band (36/38 kDa) and a heavy chain (160 kDa). Under non-reducing conditions complexes of 200 and 400 kDa could be demonstrated. Antibodies were raised against both chains of alpha 1-macroglobulin which did not cross-react with either rat alpha 2-macroglobulin or rat alpha 1-inhibitor 3. It was shown that in the medium of [35S]methionine-labeled hepatocytes the two subunits of alpha 1-macroglobulin are linked by disulfide bridges. Intracellularly, however, a high molecular mass polypeptide (185 kDa) could be immunoprecipitated with either the antiserum to the heavy or the light chain of alpha 1-macroglobulin, indicating the existence of a polyprotein precursor. Also in a cell-free translation system alpha 1-macroglobulin was synthesized as a polyprotein consisting of heavy and light chains (162 kDa). In a pulse-chase experiment using tunicamycin to block N-glycosylation, alpha 1-macroglobulin secretion was totally inhibited. This finding reflects the importance of the oligosaccharide side chains for the proteolytic processing to the two subunits and/or secretion of alpha 1-macroglobulin."
https://openalex.org/W1577333457,"Hyperthermia (45 degrees C) induced the synthesis of a characteristic heat-shock protein of 70,000 daltons (70 hsp) in Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells. In addition, subsequent to heat shock, there was a substantial increase in the 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (2',5'-A synthetase) activity in both MDBK and human WISH cells. However, in contrast to 70 hsp synthesis, which reached its maximum 3 h after cell transfer from 45 to 37 degrees C, increase in 2',5'-A synthetase expression, conspicuous after 6 h, attained its maximum only 18 h after transfer. Another interesting observation is that, during recovery at 37 degrees C, the cells released into the medium heat-shock-induced factor(s) (HSIF) capable of inducing an increase in 2',5'-A synthetase activity in fresh MDBK cells. HSIF behaves as a polypeptide with a molecular weight of more than 5,000; it is relatively heat stable and sensitive to acidic treatment. HISF seems different from interferon (IFN) since: 1) no detectable antiviral state developed after infection in cells treated with HSIF; 2) antibovine IFN antibodies did not abolish the inducing capacity of HSIF; 3) IFN had an additive effect on the inducing capacity of HSIF, and 4) HSIF released from bovine cells induced a net enhancement of 2',5'-A synthetase activity in human WISH cells. The first three of these observations applied also to heat-shocked MDBK cells."
https://openalex.org/W1584327386,"During amino acid starvation the synthesis of rRNA and tRNA is specifically inhibited (stringently controlled) in wild type Escherichia coli but not in relaxed strains carrying the relA mutation. We have found that the in vivo transcription of a hybrid rrnB rRNA operon, in which the normal promoter region has been replaced by the lambda PL promoter, is under control even though this promoter lacks the stringent discriminator sequence postulated to be required for control. Furthermore, we have found that transcription of the rrnB operon from a phage T7 promoter, as well as T7 genes in general, by phage T7 RNA polymerase is also subject to control in vivo. These results are consistent with the idea that control acts in a relatively nonspecific manner to inhibit some step(s) in transcription that are often rate-limiting for very active transcription. The relative simplicity of transcription by phage T7 RNA polymerase should offer a good system to study the molecular mechanisms of control."

https://openalex.org/W1483905528,"Abstract Human anomalous killer (AK) cells lyse freshly isolated human melanoma cells which are insensitive to human natural killer cell-mediated lysis. Monoclonal antibody Leo Mel 3, an IgM (k), produced by a hybridoma obtained from a mouse immunized with human melanoma cells, binds to melanoma cells and inhibits their conjugate formation with AK cells as well as their AK cell-mediated lysis. Other IgM antibodies from the same fusion that bind melanoma cells do not inhibit (Werkmeister, J. A., Triglia, T., Andrews, P., and Burns, G. F. (1985) J. Immunol. 135, 689-695). Leo Mel 3 binds several different gangliosides from melanoma cells, as determined by immunostaining thin layer chromatograms. Binding is abolished by treatment of the gangliosides with neuraminidase. In solid-phase radioimmunoassay, Leo Mel 3 binds strongly to ganglioside GD2 and less strongly to gangliosides GT3, GD3, and GQ1b. It does not bind to other gangliosides including GM1, GM2, GM3, GD1a, GD1b, and GT1b. Thus, the epitope recognized by antibody Leo Mel 3 is found in the sugar sequence of ganglioside GD2, GalNAc beta 1-4[NeuAc alpha 2-8NeuAc alpha 2-3]Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1 .... This sequence may contain a target in melanoma cells recognized by AK cells."
https://openalex.org/W1592139827,"Inhibitors of Na+/H+ exchange from the amiloride series are known to accumulate within the cell and cause an inhibition of a variety of cellular functions. In order to render the amiloride molecule impermeable to cells, we have synthesized a potent amiloride analog, 5-N-(3-aminophenyl)amiloride (compound A35, Ki = 60 nM). The isothiocyanate derivative of A35 (A35-NCS) was coupled to soluble dextrans of 15-20 kDa that have been derivatized with diaminoalkane spacer groups. Dextran-bound amiloride derivatives showed good inhibition of Na+/H+ exchange in human foreskin fibroblasts and A431 cells. Among several spacer groups tested, dextran derivatized with ethylenediamine showed the highest inhibitory activity. The intrinsic inhibitory potency of this polymer increased with increasing degree of substitution with A35, approaching that of free A35 with substitution of approximately 3 mol of A35 per mole of dextran. Coupling to dextran largely diminished side effects of the amiloride derivative on cells such as the inhibition of protein synthesis. A35-dextran was an effective inhibitor of serum-induced reinitiation of DNA synthesis in human foreskin fibroblasts in a bicarbonate-free medium, pH 7.1, but had little effect when either the pH of the medium was more alkaline or when the medium contained a bicarbonate buffer. These findings suggest that the selective inhibition of Na+/H+ antiport by A35-dextran prevents the reinitiation of DNA synthesis when the external conditions are such that the antiporter activity is required for the establishment of a permissive intracellular pH. Polymer-bound amiloride analogs should be useful as selective inhibitors in studies of the physiological role of the Na+/H+ antiporter, as well as for affinity purification of the antiporter."
https://openalex.org/W1538948515,"Lizard insulin receptors are evolutionarily highly conserved. Wheat germ agglutinin-purified brain membranes demonstrate the presence of an endogenous substrate (pp 105) for both the insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I receptors. Both insulin and I-insulin-like growth factor-I stimulate the phosphorylation of this endogenous substrate in a dose-dependent manner. Following insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation of the beta subunit, there is a lag period of about 5 min prior to observable phosphorylation of the endogenous substrate. Phosphoamino acid analysis of both the beta subunit as well as pp 105 reveal primarily phosphotyrosine in both the basal as well as the stimulated state."
https://openalex.org/W2164580732,"We have investigated effects of temperature on the catalytic and allosteric properties of the cGMP-stimulated cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase from calf liver. Vmax for cAMP and cGMP increased as assay temperature increased from 5 to 45 degrees C. At substrate concentrations below Kmapp, however, hydrolysis increased as temperature decreased from 45 to 5 degrees C and was much greater at 5 degrees C than at 45 degrees C. As assay temperature decreased, Kmapp for cAMP and cGMP decreased. Hill coefficients for cAMP and cGMP were approximately 1.9 at 45 degrees C and 1.2-1.0 at 5 degrees C. cGMP stimulated hydrolysis of 0.5 microM [3H]cAMP at all assay temperatures. Although maximal activity stimulated by cGMP, like Vmax, was lowest at 5 degrees C, presumably because of the effect of temperature on catalytic activity, the apparent activation constant (K alpha app) for cGMP stimulation was lower at 5 degrees C than at 45 degrees C. Thus, for both substrate and effector was increased at 5 degrees C, suggesting that low temperature promotes transitions of the cGMP-stimulated phosphodiesterase to a affinity state. That cGMP stimulated cAMP hydrolysis at 5 degrees C suggests that temperature-induced transitions are incomplete and/or readily reversible. In assays at 30 degrees C competitive inhibitors, like substrates, induce allosteric transitions which result in enhanced hydrolysis of low substrate (1.0 microM [3H] cAMP) concentrations. At higher substrate concentrations (50 microM [3H]cAMP), with the enzyme in the activated state, inhibitors compete with substrate at catalytic sites and reduce hydrolysis. At 45 degrees C, as at 30 degrees C, 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine (IBMX) and papaverine increased hydrolysis of 1.0 microM [3H]cAMP and reduced hydrolysis of 50 microM [3H]cAMP. At 5 degrees C, however, IBMX and papaverine inhibited hydrolysis of both 1.0 and 50 microM [3H]cAMP. Enzyme activity was relatively more sensitive to inhibition by IBMX at 5 degrees C than at 45 degrees C. Taken together, these observations support the notion that low temperature induces incomplete or readily reversible transitions to the high state for substrates, effectors, and inhibitors. These observed effects of temperature also point out that enzyme determinants and topographical features responsible for transitions to the high state and expression of catalytic activity can be regulated independently."
https://openalex.org/W1510358940,"The reactions of alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) with plasmin or streptokinase-plasmin(ogen) (SkPl) were studied as a function of temperature. alpha 2M and plasmin reacted relatively rapidly at all temperatures. The initial rates of reaction were identical at 24 and 37 degrees C. At 4 degrees C, the initial reaction rate was somewhat slower; however, the reaction was 90% complete in 2 min. The reaction of alpha 2M with SkPl was markedly temperature-dependent. Initial rates of reaction at 0 and 24 degrees C were only 3 and 40% of the rate of 37 degrees C, respectively. When these reactions occur, only the plasmin moiety is incorporated in the alpha 2M molecule. These data explain the inconsistencies in previous reports of SkPl interactions with alpha 2M, since experiments have been performed at different temperatures in various studies. In the present work, we present a model which interprets the data in terms of a possible high-energy transition state in the alpha 2M-SkPl reaction."
