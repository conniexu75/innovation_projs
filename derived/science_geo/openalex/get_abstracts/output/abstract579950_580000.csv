They report 91 genes with an excess of de novo or private disruptive mutations, identify 25 genes showing a bias for autism versus intellectual disability, and highlight a network associated with high-functioning autism. Gene-disruptive mutations contribute to the biology of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), but most of the related pathogenic genes are not known. We sequenced 208 candidate genes from >11,730 cases and >2,867 controls. We identified 91 genes, including 38 new NDD genes, with an excess of de novo mutations or private disruptive mutations in 5.7% of cases. Drosophila functional assays revealed a subset with increased involvement in NDDs. We identified 25 genes showing a bias for autism versus intellectual disability and highlighted a network associated with high-functioning autism (full-scale IQ >100). Clinical follow-up for NAA15, KMT5B, and ASH1L highlighted new syndromic and nonsyndromic forms of disease."

Curative therapies are most successful when cancer is diagnosed and treated at an early stage. We advocate that technological advances in next-generation sequencing of circulating, tumor-derived nucleic acids hold promise for addressing the challenge of developing safe and effective cancer screening tests. Cancer-specific mortality from most types of solid tumors has barely decreased in decades, despite an exponential increase in our knowledge about cancer pathogenesis and significant investments in the development of effective treatments. The past few years have witnessed a dramatic success of immunotherapies in treating a subgroup of patients with a variety of tumor types, including lung, bladder, and kidney, as well as Hodgkin’s lymphoma and melanoma. While such breakthroughs offer the hope of prolonged survival for some patients with advanced cancers, finding cancers earlier would still afford the greatest chance for cure, given that the survival rates for patients with early diagnoses are five to ten times higher compared with late stage disease (Cho et al., 2014Cho H. Mariotto A.B. Schwartz L.M. Luo J. Woloshin S. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. Monogr. 2014; 2014: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). By enabling diagnosis and localized treatment of early stage invasive cancers (and, in some cases, pre-invasive states), screening for cervical and colorectal cancers has contributed to significant declines in mortality from these diseases. Similarly, effective population screening paradigms for many other common and deadly tumor types are clearly needed to broadly reduce cancer-specific mortality. Despite the promise, the field of early cancer detection is filled with cautionary tales that highlight the challenges. Early stage solid tumors are small and are thereby difficult to be non-invasively distinguished from normal anatomic and biochemical variation. This ambiguity leads to detection algorithms that either miss a large number of invasive cancers or make the costly trade-off of over-diagnosing and consequently over treating. For instance, high false-positive rates from mammography in breast cancer screening, low-dose CT in lung cancer screening, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening (Nelson et al., 2016aNelson H.D. O’Meara E.S. Kerlikowske K. Balch S. Miglioretti D. Ann. Intern. Med. 2016; 164: 226-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, Aberle et al., 2011Aberle D.R. Adams A.M. Berg C.D. Black W.C.

Intern.

Pappas M. Cantor A. Griffin J. Daeges M. Humphrey L. Ann. Intern. Med. 2016; 164: 256-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Even where cancer screening has produced significant stage shifts, as with breast and prostate cancer screening, the impact on cancer-specific mortality has not been a predictable outcome (Berry, 2014Berry D.A. Cancer. 2014; 120: 2784-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Multiple explanations may account for this phenomenon. First, early stage cancers detected by mammography and PSA are likely to be clinically insignificant or “non-lethal,” meaning that, in the absence of screening and treatment, these tumors would not have become clinically evident, metastatic, or contributory to patient mortality. Second, some lethal tumors diagnosed in an apparently localized state may already have disseminated with occult metastatic disease, making local treatment with surgery or radiation non-curative. Earlier diagnosis of these tumors would result in a “lead-time bias” without impacting cancer-specific mortality. Third, mammography and PSA may be sensitive for indolent tumors, but not sufficiently sensitive for lethal cancers, particularly when these cancers are in a pre-metastatic state and thus still curable. This kinetic aspect of cancer progression is poorly understood, but it is essential to informing effective screening intervals. It is worth noting that mammography and PSA are only surrogate measures of cancer, which have poor specificity and provide little insight into tumor biology. We would argue that for successful screening, we need a platform that provides direct, sensitive, and specific measures of cancer and its attributes, which have bearing on clinical behavior. Profiling of a tumor’s somatic alterations has become routine, and many clinical tests are now available that interrogate anywhere from a few genes to the whole human genome (Cheng et al., 2015Cheng D.T. Mitchell T.N. Zehir A. Shah R.H. Benayed R. Syed A. Chandramohan R. Liu Z.Y. Won H.H. Scott S.N. et al.J. Mol. Diagn. 2015; 17: 251-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar). For a given tumor, its unique set of somatic alterations creates a biological signature that is highly specific to the individual tumor and appears to be specific to cancer in general when compared to normal tissues. Extensive research has demonstrated that tumor-derived somatic alterations in DNA can be detected in the plasma of cancer patients in the form of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) (Bettegowda et al., 2014Bettegowda C. Sausen M. Leary R.J. Kinde I. Wang Y. Agrawal N. Bartlett B.R. Wang H. Luber B. Alani R.M. et al.Sci. Transl. Med. 2014; 6 (224ra24-224ra24)Crossref PubMed Scopus (2961) Google Scholar). This circulating tumor-derived DNA (ctDNA) is presumably shed from tumors, either through necrosis or apoptosis. Commercial “liquid biopsy” tests performed on patients with metastatic disease interrogate the ctDNA in order to identify clinically actionable tumor genotypes in lieu of a tissue biopsy. Importantly, the data provided by these tests indicate that these genotypes are not common in the plasma of individuals that are presumably cancer-free (Thress et al., 2015Thress K.S. Brant R. Carr T.H. Dearden S. Jenkins S. Brown H. Hammett T. Cantarini M. Barrett J.C. Lung Cancer. 2015; 90: 509-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). It is worth noting that tumor-derived RNA and DNA methylation patterns can also be detected in the plasma (Chan et al., 2013Chan K.C.A. Jiang P. Chan C.W.M. Sun K. Wong J. Hui E.P. Chan S.L. Chan W.C. Hui D.S.C. Ng S.S.M. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 18761-18768Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) and provide complementary information to the somatic alterations detected in ctDNA. At present, relatively little is known about the biology of cfDNA, such as the mechanism through which it is produced and comes into systemic circulation, and the physiologic variability (e.g., diurnal variation) and kinetics of clearance. Further, the quantitative relationship between the relative and absolute level of ctDNA in the blood and biological features of a tumor (genotype, size, vascularity, anatomy) are not known. Basic research into the fundamental biology of ctDNA is needed to interpret ctDNA signals and their associations with clinical manifestations of cancer. Solid tumors are biologically diverse. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) indicates immense variation between cancers at the DNA, RNA, and epigenetic levels, not just between tissues, but even within a given tissue type (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network et al., 2013Weinstein J.N. Collisson E.A. Mills G.B. Shaw K.R. Ozenberger B.A. Ellrott K. Shmulevich I. Sander C. Stuart J.M. Cancer Genome Atlas Research NetworkNat. Genet. 2013; 45: 1113-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (4139) Google Scholar). Moreover, the patient-specific tumor microenvironment and immune system impact the evolution and lethality of a tumor. Compared to infectious disease, which has well-defined causative agents with highly conserved biology, a population of cancer patients behaves as a heterogeneous collection of many diseases, each of which carries additional heterogeneity in its own right. Therefore, identifying a finite number of protein or nucleic acid biomarkers that are highly sensitive and specific to even a single cancer is difficult, let alone multiple cancers. There is evidence for the presence of ctDNA in early cancers (Bettegowda et al., 2014Bettegowda C. Sausen M. Leary R.J. Kinde I. Wang Y. Agrawal N. Bartlett B.R. Wang H. Luber B. Alani R.M. et al.Sci. Transl. Med. 2014; 6 (224ra24-224ra24)Crossref PubMed Scopus (2961) Google Scholar). However, the fraction of tumors that shed detectable levels of ctDNA, by tumor type and stage, is not well studied. The studies to date have small numbers of samples and use a variety of measurement techniques that are often not comparable. Despite these caveats, ctDNA is a fundamentally different type of cancer “biomarker” than most that have been used for cancer detection. Most importantly, ctDNA detection leverages the hallmarks of cancer as a disease of genomic alterations and is thus a direct measurement of the tumor. As such, it has the potential to be more specific to the presence of the tumor than other surrogate and downstream measurements of proteins and metabolites. However, the implementation of such a test would be technically challenging, since many genes would have to be simultaneously queried for alterations in order to cover enough of the known diversity in cancer genomes to see most tumors. While next-generation DNA sequencing technology does enable high degrees of target multiplexing, the depth of sequencing would also have to be very high to sample enough ctDNA molecules to reliably measure them in a background of mostly non-tumor-derived cfDNA. We estimate that such a broad and deep sequencing approach could require orders of magnitude more sequence data than liquid biopsy assays currently use (Table 1). To generate such a large amount of DNA sequence data today in the performance of a routine cancer screening test would be cost-prohibitive, but it is likely to become more technically and economically feasible as the cost of computation and sequencing continues to decrease.Table 1Comparison of ctDNA Liquid Biopsy Test to Potential Cancer Screening TestIndicationTumor Liquid Biopsy (Genotyping, Monitoring)Early Cancer DetectionTarget populationPatients with known diagnosis of cancerAsymptomatic individualsTissue referenceCan be informed by tissue analysesNo prior knowledge of tissueKey performance characteristicsSensitivity and specificity for specific actionable genotypes•Sensitivity and specificity for clinically detectable cancer•Premium on specificity in individuals without detectable cancer•Tissue of origin needed to guide workupClinical Endpoint for UtilityTherapeutic benefit with specific therapiesNet outcome improvement with early detection and local treatment of cancerGenes Covered10-50100-1000sctDNA Limit of Detection0.1%<0.01%Importance of Novel Variant DetectionLowHighAmount of Sequencing1x100XStudy Size for Clinical Validity and Utility100’s10,000 - 100,000 s Open table in a new tab Clinical development of a ctDNA-based approach for broadly applicable cancer screening requires very large-scale clinical evidence for both test development and demonstration of clinical utility. Test development needs to address the dual challenges of sensitivity for early stage disease and the need for exquisite specificity. For sensitivity, the low level of signal in early stage disease, as well as the heterogeneity of cancer genomes present in the population, needs to be overcome to achieve efficacy. For each targeted tumor type, it is expected that at least several hundred of examples of cancer patients, particularly early stage patients, are required to adequately characterize the potential cancer-defining variants observable in plasma. To confirm that variants are indeed cancer-defining, test development must also evaluate specificity in plasma-cell-free DNA profiles from large numbers of healthy individuals without a known diagnosis of cancer and who are representative controls for the cancer population. Meanwhile, longitudinal clinical follow-up of these non-cancer subjects for future cancer diagnoses is important for distinguishing false positive signals from true positives. As true cancer events are relatively rare within a general screening population (≪1% per year for a given tumor type), the demands on specificity will be particularly high to minimize harm due to false positives and compatibility with practical application in the healthcare system. Adding to the specificity challenge are recent reports of somatic alterations accumulating in both solid tissues and the hematopoietic system as a function of age (Genovese et al., 2014Genovese G. Kähler A.K. Handsaker R.E. Lindberg J. Rose S.A. Bakhoum S.F. Chambert K. Mick E. Neale B.M. Fromer M. et al.N. Engl. J. Med. 2014; 371: 2477-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1978) Google Scholar, Alexandrov et al., 2015Alexandrov L.B. Jones P.H. Wedge D.C. Sale J.E. Campbell P.J. Nik-Zainal S. Stratton M.R. Nat. Genet. 2015; 47: 1402-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). To achieve high clinical specificity, a ctDNA-based screening test must be capable of distinguishing between the background signal originating from such non-cancer or pre-cancerous processes and the invasive malignancy of real interest. Additional challenges for clinical development arise from the prevailing anatomic and pathologic paradigm for cancer diagnosis and staging. First, an ideal non-invasive screening test would also provide information on the tissue of origin to streamline the downstream workup, including imaging and tissue diagnosis. This information may be possible through ctDNA, given the distinct differences in the patterns of somatic alterations between different tumor types, at least at a population level (Ciriello et al., 2013Ciriello G. Miller M.L. Aksoy B.A. Senbabaoglu Y. Schultz N. Sander C. Nat. Genet. 2013; 45: 1127-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Second, a proportion of screen-detected early stage tumors may prove to be clinically insignificant, as has been described for screen-detected prostate and breast cancers. These entities may be biologically distinct from lethal variants or potentially held in check by the host immune system, and finding and treating these cancers could lead to harm through over-diagnosis and over-treatment. It is possible that mutational signatures in ctDNA could distinguish clinically insignificant biological processes from malignant and lethal biological processes. In addition, serial measurements of the ctDNA signal may identify distinct trajectories with different kinetics for indolent versus lethal disease, thus functionally stratifying these patient populations. Third and finally, early stage tumors, as currently defined by anatomic staging, are not uniformly cured with local therapy. For some tumor types such as lung cancer and pancreatic cancer, the majority of “localized” tumors eventually relapse and thus could contribute to lead-time bias for a screening program. These individuals clearly have occult metastatic disease, which is not accurately captured with current staging. Post-operative ctDNA levels have now been shown to predict relapse (Tie et al., 2016Tie J. Wang Y. Tomasetti C. Li L. Springer S. Kinde I. Silliman N. Tacey M. Wong H.L. Christie M. et al.Sci. Transl. Med. 2016; 8: 346ra92Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). By identifying “early stage” patients who have been under-staged, ctDNA could minimize the effect of lead-time bias by directing aggressive post-operative systemic therapy to a population where the benefit would be greatest. Ultimately, to demonstrate the clinical utility of a ctDNA cancer screening test, a prospective clinical trial, comparing the strategy of early detection based on the ctDNA test with the standard of care, is necessary. Given the potential biases in cancer screening studies, including lead time bias (Berry, 2014Berry D.A. Cancer. 2014; 120: 2784-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), a randomized design is likely required to achieve a practice-changing level of evidence. Because the yearly incidence rate for cancer is low (1%–2% in aggregate across tumor types), and because differences in cancer-specific mortality can take years to manifest, it is anticipated that such a study would require hundreds of thousands of participants to be appropriately powered. Early assessment of efficacy would be possible with large effect sizes and by evaluating surrogate endpoints, including cumulative incidence of de novo and recurrent metastatic disease. In this regard, GRAIL, a company recently created by some of the authors, was formed to develop ctDNA-based cancer screening tests, is conducting a study to create a reference library of the cancer mutations in the blood for the most common cancers and the background mutations found in matched healthy subjects. This 10,000-plus subject study, called the Circulating Cell-Free Genome Atlas (CCGA) (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02889978), should complete enrollment within one year and will be the largest database on mutations found in the blood of cancer patients. The Cancer Moonshot Initiative recently announced the Blood Profiling Atlas Project, which also aims to compile data on cancer signals in the blood. GRAIL intends to apply a next-generation sequencing approach, combining sequencing depth and breadth of genomic coverage, as well as machine learning, to develop models based on cell-free DNA for the accurate classification of subjects with and without cancer. Tests based upon these models, derived from CCGA and additional studies, will be prospectively evaluated in observational cohorts and eventually in clinical utility studies as described above. The biological, technical, and clinical obstacles to developing a safe and effective pan-cancer screening test are significant. However, we have new tools that directly measure the sin qua non of cancer (its somatic alterations) in ways not previously possible. Low-cost next-generation sequencing has enabled the sequencing of tumor-derived nucleic acids circulating in the blood. This non-invasive characterization of a tumor’s genome—combined with new methods of processing complex data, including machine learning—may enable sensitive and specific detection of curable, lethal cancers. Finally, new adaptive approaches to population-scale screening trials are emerging that could be employed to test the clinical utility of this approach. Given these advances, the time has come for a new and unprecedented level of effort to develop life-saving tests that can detect cancer early, when it can be cured."
https://openalex.org/W2949181286,"Recent research has uncovered an important role for de novo variation in neurodevelopmental disorders. Using aggregated data from 9,246 families with autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, or developmental delay, we found that ∼1/3 of de novo variants are independently present as standing variation in the Exome Aggregation Consortium's cohort of 60,706 adults, and these de novo variants do not contribute to neurodevelopmental risk. We further used a loss-of-function (LoF)-intolerance metric, pLI, to identify a subset of LoF-intolerant genes containing the observed signal of associated de novo protein-truncating variants (PTVs) in neurodevelopmental disorders. LoF-intolerant genes also carry a modest excess of inherited PTVs, although the strongest de novo-affected genes contribute little to this excess, thus suggesting that the excess of inherited risk resides in lower-penetrant genes. These findings illustrate the importance of population-based reference cohorts for the interpretation of candidate pathogenic variants, even for analyses of complex diseases and de novo variation."
https://openalex.org/W2588755013,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, with the majority of mortality resulting from metastatic spread. However, the molecular mechanism by which cancer cells acquire the ability to disseminate from primary tumors, seed distant organs, and grow into tissue-destructive metastases remains incompletely understood. We combined tumor barcoding in a mouse model of human lung adenocarcinoma with unbiased genomic approaches to identify a transcriptional program that confers metastatic ability and predicts patient survival. Small-scale in vivo screening identified several genes, including Cd109, that encode novel pro-metastatic factors. We uncovered signaling mediated by Janus kinases (Jaks) and the transcription factor Stat3 as a critical, pharmacologically targetable effector of CD109-driven lung cancer metastasis. In summary, by coupling the systematic genomic analysis of purified cancer cells in distinct malignant states from mouse models with extensive human validation, we uncovered several key regulators of metastatic ability, including an actionable pro-metastatic CD109-Jak-Stat3 axis."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of one of these SPMs, maresin 1 (MaR1), to reverse adipose tissue inflammation and/or insulin resistance in two models of obesity: diet-induced obese (DIO) mice and genetic (ob/ob) obese mice. In DIO mice, MaR1 (2 mg/kg; 10 d) reduced F4/80-positive cells and expression of the proinflammatory M1 macrophage phenotype marker Cd11c in white adipose tissue (WAT). Moreover, MaR1 decreased Mcp-1, Tnf-a, and Il-1b expression, upregulated adiponectin and Glut-4, and increased Akt phosphorylation in WAT. MaR1 administration (2 mg/kg; 20 d) to ob/ob mice did not modify macrophage recruitment but increased the M2 macrophage markers Cd163 and Il-10. MaR1 reduced Mcp-1, Tnf-a, Il-1b, and Dpp-4 and increased adiponectin gene expression in WAT. MaR1 treatment also improved the insulin tolerance test of ob/ob mice and increased Akt and AMPK phosphorylation in WAT. These data suggest that treatment with MaR1 can counteract the dysfunctional inflamed WAT and could be useful to improve insulin sensitivity in murine models of obesity.—Martínez-Fernández, L., González-Muniesa, P., Laiglesia, L.

An increase in the cellular expression level of DHFR is one of the mechanisms of tumor resistance to methotrexate. The present study investigated the possibility that adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing, which causes nucleotide conversion by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes, might modulate DHFR expression. In human breast adenocarcinoma-derived MCF-7 cells, 26 RNA editing sites were identified in the 3′-UTR of DHFR. Knockdown of ADAR1 decreased the RNA editing levels of DHFR and resulted in a decrease in the DHFR mRNA and protein levels, indicating that ADAR1 up-regulates DHFR expression. Using a computational analysis, miR-25-3p and miR-125a-3p were predicted to bind to the non-edited 3′-UTR of DHFR but not to the edited sequence. The decrease in DHFR expression by the knockdown of ADAR1 was restored by transfection of antisense oligonucleotides for these miRNAs, suggesting that RNA editing mediated up-regulation of DHFR requires the function of these miRNAs. Interestingly, we observed that the knockdown of ADAR1 decreased cell viability and increased the sensitivity of MCF-7 cells to methotrexate.

DHFR catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate using NADPH as a cofactor. Because tetrahydrofolate is essential for de novo purine and thymidylate synthesis required for DNA synthesis, cell growth, and proliferation, DHFR is a target of chemotherapeutic agents such as methotrexate and pemetrexed (1.Schweitzer Schweitzer Dicker Dicker Bertino Bertino Dihydrofolate reductase as a therapeutic target.FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2441-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 2.Fowler Fowler The folate cycle and disease in humans.Kidney Int.

In this study, we sought to investigate a possibility that RNA editing might also underlie the regulatory mechanism. dihydrofolate reductase adenosine deaminase acting on RNA antisense locked nucleic acid/DNA oligonucleotides adenosine-to-inosine double-stranded RNA microRNA microRNA recognition element 2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium monosodium salt. RNA editing is a post-transcriptional process that alters the nucleotide sequence of RNA transcripts. In animals, the most common type of RNA editing is deamination of adenosine (A) into inosine (I), A-to-I RNA editing (19.Wagner Wagner Smith Smith Cooperman Cooperman Nishikura Nishikura A double-stranded RNA unwinding activity introduces structural alterations by means of adenosine to inosine conversions in mammalian cells and Xenopus eggs.Proc.

Because much of the cellular machinery treats inosine as a guanine nucleotide, the conversion of nucleotides potentially changes the amino acid sequence, splicing, miRNA targeting, or miRNA maturation (21.Farajollahi Farajollahi Maas Maas Molecular diversity through RNA editing: a balancing act.Trends Genet. 2010; 26: 221-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). A-to-I RNA editing is catalyzed by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes (22.Kim Kim Wang Wang Sanford Sanford Zeng Zeng Nishikura Nishikura Molecular cloning of cDNA for double-stranded RNA adenosine deaminase, a candidate enzyme for nuclear RNA editing.Proc.

They convert adenosines in double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) structures into inosines by hydrolytic deamination. There are three members of the ADAR family in vertebrates: ADAR1, ADAR2, and ADAR3 (also called ADAR, ADARB1, and ADARB2, respectively) (24.Bass Bass Nishikura Nishikura Keller Keller Seeburg Seeburg Emeson Emeson O'Connell O'Connell Samuel Samuel Herbert Herbert A standardized nomenclature for adenosine deaminases that act on RNA.RNA. 1997; 3: 947-949PubMed Google Scholar). ADAR1 and ADAR2 are ubiquitously expressed and have RNA editing activity. In contrast, there is no evidence to support the enzymatic activity of ADAR3 (25.Nishikura Nishikura Functions and regulation of RNA editing by ADAR deaminases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2010; 79: 321-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). The ADAR1 gene produces two protein isoforms, ADAR1 p110 (110-kDa protein) and ADAR1 p150 (150-kDa protein), from different transcription initiation sites and start codons. The former is constitutively expressed in the nucleus, whereas the latter is localized in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments and induced by interferon (26.Patterson Patterson Samuel Samuel Expression and regulation by interferon of a double-stranded-RNA-specific adenosine deaminase from human cells: evidence for two forms of the deaminase.Mol.

Early studies revealed that RNA editing plays important roles in the central nervous system (28.Tariq Tariq Jantsch Jantsch Transcript diversification in the nervous system: A to I RNA editing in CNS function and disease development.Front. Neurosci. 2012; 6: 99Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For example, glutamate receptor subtype A2 and 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor subtype 2C were known to be subjected to RNA editing (29.Sommer Sommer Köhler Köhler Sprengel Sprengel Seeburg Seeburg RNA editing in brain controls a determinant of ion flow in glutamate-gated channels.Cell. 1991; 67: 11-19Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar, 30.Lomeli Lomeli Mosbacher Mosbacher Melcher Melcher Höger Höger Geiger Geiger Kuner Kuner Monyer Monyer Higuchi Higuchi Bach Bach Seeburg Seeburg Control of kinetic properties of AMPA receptor channels by nuclear RNA editing.Science. 1994; 266: 1709-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar–31.Burns Burns Chu Chu Rueter Rueter Hutchinson Hutchinson Canton Canton Sanders-Bush Sanders-Bush Emeson Emeson Regulation of serotonin-2C receptor G-protein coupling by RNA editing.Nature. 1997; 387: 303-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar), and the disruption of RNA editing in these genes leads to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Prader-Willi syndrome, respectively (32.Kawahara Kawahara Ito Ito Sun Sun Aizawa Aizawa Kanazawa Kanazawa Kwak Kwak Glutamate receptors: RNA editing and death of motor neurons.Nature. 2004; 427: 801Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 33.Morabito Morabito Abbas Abbas Hood Hood Kesterson Kesterson Jacobs Jacobs Kump Kump Hachey Hachey Roth Roth Emeson Emeson Mice with altered serotonin 2C receptor RNA editing display characteristics of Prader-Willi syndrome.Neurobiol. Dis. 2010; 39: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In these cases, A-to-I editing occurs within exons, changing crucial amino acids for protein function. Accumulating evidence has revealed that aberrant ADAR expression and disrupted RNA editing levels are associated with diseases including cancer, metabolic diseases, viral infections, autoimmune disorders, and neurological disorders (34.Slotkin Slotkin Nishikura Nishikura Adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing and human disease.Genome Med. 2013; 5: 105Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Recent progress in next-generation sequencing with RNA-Seq has resulted in the identification of global RNA editing sites in non-coding as well as coding regions, supporting broader roles of RNA editing in the body (35.Wahlstedt Wahlstedt Daniel Daniel Ensterö Ensterö Ohman Ohman Large-scale mRNA sequencing determines global regulation of RNA editing during brain development.Genome Res. 2009; 19: 978-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 36.Liu Liu Ma Ma Chen Chen Schuyler Schuyler Chang Chang Tan Tan Functional Impact of RNA editing and ADARs on regulation of gene expression: perspectives from deep sequencing studies.Cell Biosci. 2014; 4: 44Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Information regarding RNA editing sites in the transcriptome is compiled in databases such as RADAR, but the biological significance of RNA editing in humans has not been completely elucidated. We noticed that DHFR has been included in RADAR, as a target of RNA editing. Multiple RNA editing sites were identified at introns 3, 4, and 5 as well as 3′-UTR of DHFR mRNA in the lymphoblastoid cell line and brain (37.Ramaswami Ramaswami Lin Lin Piskol Piskol Tan Tan Davis Davis Li Li Accurate identification of human Alu and non-Alu RNA editing sites.Nat.

Methods. 2013; 10: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). However, it is uncertain whether the DHFR is edited or not in breast cancer, in which ADAR1 has been reported to function as an oncogene (39.Fumagalli Fumagalli Gacquer Gacquer Rothé Rothé Lefort Lefort Libert Libert Brown Brown Kheddoumi Kheddoumi Shlien Shlien Konopka Konopka Salgado Salgado Larsimont Larsimont Polyak Polyak Willard-Gallo Willard-Gallo Desmedt Desmedt Piccart Piccart Abramowicz Abramowicz Campbell Campbell Sotiriou Sotiriou Detours Detours Principles governing A-to-I RNA editing in the breast cancer transcriptome.Cell Rep. 2015; 13: 277-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the possibility that RNA editing might modulate DHFR expression and subsequently affect the proliferation and sensitivity of breast cancer cells to methotrexate. The effects of knockdown of ADAR1 or ADAR2 on human DHFR expression in MCF-7 cells were investigated. The siADAR1 targets both ADAR1 p110 and ADAR1 p150. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, there was a significant decrease in ADAR1 (both p110 and p150) and ADAR2 protein levels by transfection of siADAR1 and siADAR2, respectively. Regarding the DHFR transcripts, four different variants (v1–v4) are registered in the NCBI database (Fig. 1C), and it is conceivable that the functional protein is produced only from the v1 transcript. Taking potential effects of RNA editing within introns on splicing into consideration, the expression levels of the four DHFR transcripts in the siRNA-transfected cells were determined. The knockdown of ADAR1 resulted in a significant decrease in the levels of all types of DHFR transcripts (Fig. 1, D–G). In contrast, the knockdown of ADAR2 significantly decreased only the DHFR v2 mRNA level. Furthermore, a significant decreased in DHFR protein levels by siADAR1 was also observed (Fig. 1H). These results indicated that ADAR1 has a role in up-regulating DHFR expression. The RADAR, a database for RNA editing sites, includes human DHFR, the transcript of which are subjected to RNA editing. The editing sites were identified in introns 3, 4, and 5 and the 3′-UTR of DHFR in the lymphoblastoid cell line and brain. It is unknown whether the DHFR transcript is subjected to RNA editing in other tissues including breast. We sought to investigate whether the 3′-UTR, rather than introns, of DHFR in MCF-7 cells is subjected to RNA editing because ADAR1 positively regulates DHFR expression regardless of the transcript variants. We performed direct sequence analyses of the 3′-UTR of DHFR using genomic DNA and cDNA from MCF-7 cells as templates. Because inosine is recognized as guanosine by sequence analysis, A-to-I RNA edited sites are identified as overlapping peaks of adenosine and guanosine. We found 26 edited sites in the 3′-UTR of DHFR with editing levels ranging from 2.9 to 71.4% (Fig. 2, A and B). They were located within inverted Alu repeats, which can form a dsRNA structure, a typical target of ADAR enzymes. To investigate whether ADAR1 or ADAR2 enzyme are responsible for the RNA editing events, we analyzed the sequence of the DHFR cDNA from MCF-7 cells transfected with siADAR1 or siADAR2. Typical sequencing electropherograms of these RNA-edited sites are shown in Fig. 2C. The RNA editing levels of all editing sites were significantly reduced by ADAR1 knockdown, but not by ADAR2 knockdown (Fig. 2B). These results indicated that ADAR1 plays a critical role in editing of the 3′-UTR of DHFR. To determine whether the decrease in DHFR mRNA by ADAR1 knockdown is due to accelerated mRNA degradation, we examined the stability of the DHFR mRNA in the siRNA-transfected cells. In the presence of α-amanitin, the DHFR mRNA level was gradually decreased. The half-life of the DHFR mRNA in the siControl-transfected cells was 28.8 h, whereas that in siADAR1-transfected cells was 9.4 h (Fig. 3A). These results indicated to us that the non-edited DHFR mRNA is more unstable than edited mRNA. To investigate this possibility, we performed direct sequence analysis of cDNA from siControl-transfected cells 6, 12, and 24 h after treatment of α-amanitin. As shown in Fig. 3B as a typical example (RNA editing site numbers 15 and 16), the heights of G were increased and those of A were decreased by treatment of α-amanitin for 24 h. Such changes were observed in the other RNA editing sites (data not shown). To evaluate the degradation rates of non-edited and edited DHFR mRNAs, their levels were calculated by multiplying the DHFR mRNA levels at each time point (Fig. 3A) by the ratio of the peak height of A and G, respectively, at corresponding time points (Fig. 3C). As shown in Fig. 3D, it was demonstrated that the non-edited DHFR mRNA was dramatically decreased by treatment of α-amanitin for 24 h, whereas the edited DHFR was not changed. Collectively, we found that DHFR mRNA was stabilized by ADAR1-mediated RNA editing. We surmised that the decrease in extent of RNA editing by ADAR1 knockdown would augment the binding of miRNA(s) to the 3′-UTR of DHFR to decrease its expression, because the 3′-UTR extensively includes binding sites for miRNAs, which down-regulate gene expression via translational repression or mRNA degradation (40.Bartel Bartel MicroRNAs: genomics, biogenesis, mechanism, and function.Cell. 2004; 116: 281-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29561) Google Scholar). By using a database miRediTar, we searched for miRNAs that would bind to the non-edited sequence in the 3′-UTR of DHFR but not to edited sequence, considering their substantial expression in MCF-7 cells (41.Fix Fix Shah Shah Efferth Efferth Farwell Farwell Zhang Zhang MicroRNA expression profile of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and the effect of green tea polyphenon-60.Cancer Genomics Proteomics. 2010; 7: 261-277PubMed Google Scholar). As a result, miR-25-3p and miR-125a-3p were raised as candidate miRNAs (Fig. 4A). To examine whether RNA editing affects the recognition of miR-25-3p and miR-125a-3p, we performed luciferase assays using reporter plasmids carrying a non-edited or edited microRNA recognition element (MRE) for miR-25-3p or miR-125a-3p. They were named pGL3p/MRE25(A) (non-edited MRE for miR-25–3p), pGL3p/MRE25(G) (edited MRE for miR-25-3p), pGL3p/MRE125(A) (non-edited MRE for miR-125-3p), and pGL3p/MRE125(G) (edited MRE for miR-125-3p). The luciferase activities of the pGL3p/MRE25(A) and pGL3p/MRE125(A) plasmids were significantly reduced (68 and 71% of the control, respectively) by the overexpression of miR-25 and miR-125a-3p, respectively, whereas the decrease in luciferase activities of the pGL3p/MRE25(G) and pGL3p/MRE125(G) plasmids were marginal (88 and 91% of the control, respectively) (Fig. 4B). Because a slight reduction was observed in the activities of empty plasmid, the decrease in activity of latter plasmids would likely be independent of the inserted fragment. Thus, it was suggested that miR-25-3p and miR-125a-3p recognize the non-edited sequences in the 3′-UTR of DHFR. To further confirm that siADAR1-mediated down-regulation of DHFR is because of binding of these miRNAs to the non-edited sequence of DHFR, overexpression or an inhibition experiment of miRNAs was performed. When miR-25-3p or miR-125a-3p were co-transfected with siADAR1, the decrease in DHFR mRNA (Fig. 4C) and protein (Fig. 4D) levels by knockdown of ADAR1 were augmented. However, inhibition of these miRNA functions attenuated the decrease in DHFR expression by ADAR 1 knockdown (Fig. 4, E and F). These results indicated that the non-edited DHFR-specific down-regulation by miR-25-3p and miR-125a-3p would be responsible for reduction of DHFR expression by ADAR1 knockdown. We noticed that the viability of MCF-7 cells was significantly decreased when ADAR1 was knocked down (Fig. 5A). Because DHFR has a key role in regulating the DNA synthesis by converting dihydrofolate into tetrahydrofolate, we postulated that the decrease in cell viability would be due to the decrease in DHFR protein level. To test this hypothesis, folinic acid, which is readily converted into tetrahydrofolate, was added to the siADAR1-transfected MCF-7 cells (42.Lladó Lladó Terés Terés Higuera Higuera Alvarez Alvarez Noguera-Salva Noguera-Salva Halver Halver Escribá Escribá Busquets Busquets Pivotal role of dihydrofolate reductase knockdown in the anticancer activity of 2-hydroxyoleic acid.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 13754-13758Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5B, the decreased cell viability by ADAR1 knockdown was partially restored by folinic acid treatment, suggesting that suppression of DHFR protein is one of the underlying causes of decreased cell viability by ADAR1 knockdown. Next, we investigated whether ADAR1 knockdown increases the sensitivity of MCF-7 cells to methotrexate because it is known that tumors with reduced expression of DHFR are more sensitive to methotrexate treatment (43.Salonga Salonga Danenberg Danenberg Johnson Johnson Metzger Metzger Groshen Groshen Tsao-Wei Tsao-Wei Lenz Lenz Leichman Leichman Leichman Leichman Diasio Diasio Danenberg Danenberg Colorectal tumors responding to 5-fluorouracil have low gene expression levels of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, thymidylate synthase, and thymidine phosphorylase.Clin.

Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1587: 164-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In this experiment, the transfected siADAR1 was decreased to 0.5 nm to make it easier to detect the efficacy of methotrexate. The increase in cell number of siControl-transfected cells was decreased 48 and 72 h after methotrexate treatment, which was further decreased by ADAR1 knockdown, suggesting that the suppression of DHFR by ADAR1 knockdown can increase the efficacy of methotrexate (Fig. 5C). To examine the role of ADAR1 in RNA editing of DHFR in vivo, ADAR1 expression and RNA editing levels of the DHFR transcript in breast cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues from 19 patients were determined. The ADAR1 mRNA levels in breast cancer tissues tended to be higher than those in adjacent normal tissues (Fig. 6A), consistent with a previous report (39.Fumagalli Fumagalli Gacquer Gacquer Rothé Rothé Lefort Lefort Libert Libert Brown Brown Kheddoumi Kheddoumi Shlien Shlien Konopka Konopka Salgado Salgado Larsimont Larsimont Polyak Polyak Willard-Gallo Willard-Gallo Desmedt Desmedt Piccart Piccart Abramowicz Abramowicz Campbell Campbell Sotiriou Sotiriou Detours Detours Principles governing A-to-I RNA editing in the breast cancer transcriptome.Cell Rep. 2015; 13: 277-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Next, by selecting 3 samples of which ADAR1 levels in cancer tissue were higher than in normal tissues (ADAR1 expression tumor/normal ratios of 9.7, 14.0, and 16.7) and 3 samples of which ADAR1 levels in cancer tissues were equal to or lower than in normal tissues (0.1, 0.9, and 1.0), the RNA editing levels in the 3′-UTR of DHFR were evaluated. In the former samples, the RNA editing levels of the DHFR transcript were higher in cancer tissues than in adjacent normal tissues (Fig. 6B), but in the latter samples (Fig. 6C), this phenomenon was not observed. These results suggest that the increased expression of ADAR1 in breast cancer contributes to hyper-editing of the DHFR transcript, which would result in an increase in DHFR expression. It has been proposed that RNA editing may alter miRNA recognition (45.Liang Liang Landweber Landweber Hypothesis: RNA editing of microRNA target sites in humans?.RNA. 2007; 13: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 46.Peng Peng Cheng Cheng Tan Tan Kang Kang Tian Tian Zhu Zhu Zhang Zhang Liang Liang Hu Hu Tan Tan Guo Guo Dong Dong Liang Liang Bao Bao Wang Wang Comprehensive analysis of RNA-Seq data reveals extensive RNA editing in a human transcriptome.Nat.

In this study, we examined the possibility that RNA editing may regulate DHFR expression by altering nucleotides in miRNA binding sites in the 3′-UTR. We found that ADAR1 catalyzes RNA editing in the 3′-UTR of DHFR in MCF-7 cells and breast cancer tissues (Figs. 2, B and C, and 6, B and C).

When we begin learning a novel skill, we have no experience about how to move to achieve a particular goal. Early in training, movements exhibit variability from attempt to attempt, allowing the motor system to explore actions and select them based on consequences (Sutton and Barto, 1998Sutton R.S.

Gradually, movement variability decreases as the motor system consolidates particular movements that lead to success (Cohen and Sternad, 2009Cohen R.G. Sternad D.

This suggests that a task-relevant neural population explores neural activity patterns to generate novel motor commands, and selects and consolidates those that achieve the desired goal. Indeed, neurophysiological motor learning studies have found that movement-related neural activity in various species follows a similar trend, exhibiting high variability in early training that reduces as particular ensembles and activity patterns are consolidated in late training (Arduin et al., 2013Arduin P.J.

However, it is unclear how exploration of particular patterns in a task-relevant neural population is accomplished, and also how goal-achieving patterns are refined and consolidated to improve performance. The motor system is distributed and redundant, with parallel pathways and many more neurons than muscles, making it difficult to investigate the causal relationship between observed neural activity patterns and motor output (Briggman and Kristan, 2008Briggman K.L. Kristan W.B. Multifunctional pattern-generating circuits.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 31: 271-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We therefore took advantage of a paradigm in which we could identify the output neurons that control behavior as well as the explicit transformation between output neuron activity and behavior. We used an operant learning brain-machine interface (BMI) in which stable recordings from ensembles of primary motor cortex (M1) neurons in macaque monkeys are input to a fixed mathematical transform (“decoder”) outputting prosthetic two-dimensional cursor movements. The BMI provided a closed-loop feedback system operating within the natural motor system (Figure 1A). Because we defined the decoder to take input from observed cells (“direct cells”), this neuroprosthetic skill learning paradigm (Ganguly and Carmena, 2009Ganguly K. Carmena J.M.

Behav. 2010; 42: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) is uniquely advantageous to investigate how a task-relevant neural population coordinates to acquire skillful control. Given that the decoder is novel, subjects must initially explore neural population activity space. This is a non-trivial search because population activity space is high dimensional, with each neuron’s activity represented as one dimension. Over training, subjects must use the behavioral consequences of explored activity patterns to select and refine goal-achieving patterns. This consolidation process is not well understood, especially as there are many neural activity patterns that can elicit the same behavioral output in systems mapping many neurons to fewer outputs, such as a BMI or our natural motor system. How might this learning happen? We consider three possibilities. In “independent neuron learning,” each neuron explores independently, as has been proposed in computational models (Héliot et al., 2010Héliot R. Ganguly K. Jimenez J. Carmena J.M. Learning in closed-loop brain-machine interfaces: modeling and experimental validation.IEEE Trans. Syst. Man Cybern.

A reward-modulated hebbian learning rule can explain experimentally observed network reorganization in a brain control task.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 8400-8410Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and each neuron tunes its independent patterns over learning (Figure 3A). Because independent neuron learning explores every dimension of population activity space, this learning can acquire any firing rate configuration and thus control any decoder. However, this learning cannot explain how subjects rapidly acquire (within 1 day) decoders that leverage neural covariance (Sadtler et al., 2014Sadtler P.T. Quick K.M. Golub M.D. Chase S.M. Ryu S.I. Tyler-Kabara E.C. Yu B.M. Batista A.P. Neural constraints on learning.Nature. 2014; 512: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). In contrast, “constrained-network learning” posits that the neural population possesses network connectivity constraints and thus preferentially produces covariation patterns within a fixed, lower-dimensional subspace of the full activity space. Indeed, both BMI and motor control studies have found that motor cortical neurons exhibit task-relevant, low-dimensional covariance during execution of well-learned behavior (Churchland et al., 2012Churchland M.M. Cunningham J.P. Kaufman M.T. Foster J.D. Nuyujukian P. Ryu S.I. Shenoy K.V.

Commun. 2015; 6: 7759Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, Sadtler et al., 2014Sadtler P.T. Quick K.M. Golub M.D. Chase S.M. Ryu S.I. Tyler-Kabara E.C. Yu B.M. Batista A.P. Neural constraints on learning.Nature. 2014; 512: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Under constrained-network learning, the neural population explores and changes covariation patterns within the fixed subspace (Sadtler et al., 2014Sadtler P.T. Quick K.M. Golub M.D. Chase S.M. Ryu S.I. Tyler-Kabara E.C. Yu B.M. Batista A.P. Neural constraints on learning.Nature. 2014; 512: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) (Figure 3B). One limitation of the constrained exploration is that this learning can only acquire decoders reading out activity within the population’s existing covariance subspace. Finally, we consider “flexible-network learning,” which both permits the learning of many decoders and can explain the emergence of new covariance. In this model, the neural population explores and changes both independent and covariation patterns. Critically, independent exploration permits subjects to initially explore a higher dimensional space of activity patterns. Upon discovering patterns with rewarding consequences, subjects may shape their network to reliably reproduce rewarding patterns, constraining patterns to lie within a low-dimensional subspace. This mechanism thus enables consolidation of covariance in a different subspace from initial covariance (Figure 3C). To determine which of these three possibilities best explains how the task-relevant neural population coordinates to acquire neuroprosthetic skill de novo, we sought to disentangle how independent and coordinating sources of neural variance changed and contributed to BMI control over the course of learning. We used Factor Analysis (FA) (Everitt, 1984Everitt B.S. An Introduction to Latent Variable Models. Chapman & Hall, London1984Crossref Google Scholar) to decompose population activity into the sum of private and shared signals, which estimate the effects of both private inputs to each cell and coordinating inputs that drive multiple cells simultaneously (Churchland et al., 2010Churchland M.M. Yu B.M. Cunningham J.P. Sugrue L.P. Cohen M.R. Corrado G.S. Newsome W.T. Clark A.M. Hosseini P. Scott B.B. et al.Stimulus onset quenches neural variability: a widespread cortical phenomenon.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, Yu et al., 2009Yu B.M. Cunningham J.P. Santhanam G. Ryu S.I. Shenoy K.V. Sahani M. Gaussian-process factor analysis for low-dimensional single-trial analysis of neural population activity.J. Neurophysiol. 2009; 102: 614-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Using FA, we arbitrated between our three learning models in addressing how a task-relevant neural population explores, consolidates, and optimizes activity to acquire a neuroprosthetic skill de novo. First, we asked how private and shared sources influence the exploration of different activity patterns from trial to trial. To isolate trial-to-trial variability from within-trial variance relevant for control, we focused on the variability of the population firing rate at coarse timescale (time window ∼1 s) for a fixed cursor state (the center of the workspace) with a fixed movement intention (the target). Second, we asked how private and shared sources contribute to within-trial control over the course of learning. To assess control-relevant neural activity, we focused on spike counts at the decoder timescale of 100 ms. This decoder-timescale neural variance can be interpreted as signal strength for BMI control. Finally, we asked how the spatial and temporal structure of late training neural activity supported skillful control. In particular, we asked whether neural activity preferentially occupied the control-relevant dimensions of the decoder, and whether a particular temporal sequence was consolidated that generated skillful control. We focused on fine-timescale trajectories at 50 ms resolution, faster even than the decoder timescale. Exploration and consolidation via independent neuron learning predict that private trial-to-trial variability decreases and private decoder-timescale variance is used for control. Constrained-network learning predicts the opposite; shared trial-to-trial variability decreases and shared decoder-timescale variance is used for control. Combining these changes under flexible-network learning, we would expect that in early learning, private trial-to-trial variability contributes to activity exploration, and private decoder-timescale variance produces variable movements, while we would expect that in late learning, shared decoder-timescale variance consolidates and contributes to skillful control. Indeed, our analyses revealed that private and shared variance changed differentially to sculpt neural spatiotemporal patterns and improve movements, providing insight into how motor cortex coordinates to explore, consolidate, and optimize population activity underlying novel skills. We analyzed data from operant learning BMI experiments (Ganguly and Carmena, 2009Ganguly K. Carmena J.M. Emergence of a stable cortical map for neuroprosthetic control.PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e1000153Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) in which two rhesus macaques chronically implanted with microelectrode arrays in M1 learned to perform a two-dimensional, self-paced, continuous control center-out BMI reaching task (Figures 1A and 1B). Each trial, subjects drove the cursor under neural control to an instructed target (randomly selected from eight possible targets) for juice reward and controlled the cursor back to center to initiate the next trial. The decoder was optimized to predict upper limb movement using input from a fixed subset of recorded neurons (“direct cells”) chosen because of their stability over days (see STAR Methods) (Ganguly and Carmena, 2009Ganguly K. Carmena J.M. Emergence of a stable cortical map for neuroprosthetic control.PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e1000153Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Because both the direct cells and the decoder parameters were held fixed for the duration of training (Monkey P, 19 days; Monkey R, 7 days), performance improvement could only be driven by adaptive changes in population activity (Figure 1A). The decoder transformed a neural activity sequence into the cursor’s x-y position (Figure 1C). The direct cells’ activity in the last 1 s was binned into 10 time lags of 100 ms bins, and linear combinations of the neuron-lag activity produced the cursor’s position. Because the number of neurons exceeded the two cursor dimensions (Monkey P, 15 neurons; Monkey R, 10 neurons), (infinitely) many activity patterns could produce the same behavior, as is the case in our motor system, which possesses more neurons than muscles. Changes in neural activity did not translate into changes in cursor position unless they occurred within the decoder’s control-relevant neural dimensions, the “readout space,” defined by the decoder weights. Under these conditions, subjects gained proficient control, improving both accuracy and success rate for all targets (Figures 2A and 2B ). Changes over learning were analyzed over “training epochs,” where each epoch contains a constant number of trials. This division of trials ensured that analysis results were not influenced by unequal numbers of trials performed on each day. Observed trends were consistent with analyses performed across days (Figures S2 and S3, available online). Note that analyses of behavioral and neural changes were performed for each target separately. All trends are plotted with error bars showing the SEM over targets. We asked how control was refined on a trial-to-trial basis by analyzing the positions the cursor entered in each trial. We computed the cursor’s trial-to-trial workspace occupancy for each individual target, i.e., the probability that the cursor entered a given position within a trial (Figure 2C). We found that the fraction of workspace entered per trial decreased as the cursor movements became increasingly direct (Figure 2D), and that the subjects’ workspace occupancy became consistent over late training epochs (Figure 2E) (see STAR Methods). These two results show that the cursor’s trial-to-trial exploration of the workspace became refined and stable with training, extending previous reports on the straightening and stabilization of trial-averaged trajectories (Ganguly and Carmena, 2009Ganguly K. Carmena J.M. Emergence of a stable cortical map for neuroprosthetic control.PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e1000153Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Finally, we found a decrease in the trial-to-trial variability of the entire set of positions entered within a trial (Figure 2F) (see STAR Methods). These results show that neural control was refined and consolidated over long-term BMI training, increasing movement success rate, directness, and consistency. Having quantified control refinement over training, we sought to model how the direct cells coordinated to explore and change neural activity patterns underlying control. Under what conditions would independent patterns (described by private variance; Figure 3A) or covariation patterns (described by shared variance; Figure 3B) be preferred for generating movement variability? When a subject has no idea which neural readout dimensions the decoder uses, private variance is beneficial because this high-dimensional exploration would generate variability in any readout space (Figure S1A). Low-dimensional shared variance might be misaligned with the readout space and thus produce little movement variability (Figure S1B). On the other hand, when the subject has experience with the readout space, low-dimensional shared variance aligned with the readout space is more efficient in generating movements because it concentrates more variance in fewer neural dimensions (Figure S1C) and leads to faster learning (Sadtler et al., 2014Sadtler P.T. Quick K.M. Golub M.D. Chase S.M. Ryu S.I. Tyler-Kabara E.C. Yu B.M. Batista A.P. Neural constraints on learning.Nature. 2014; 512: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Thus, flexible-network learning combines these properties, allowing the population to expansively explore using private variance and then consolidate control-specific shared variance. Importantly, exploring the behavioral consequences of activity outside the initial shared space could guide the shared space to rotate or change dimensionality (Figure 3C). Seeking evidence for these neural activity changes, we used FA to decompose population firing rate activity into the sum of (1) a mean rate; (2) private signals, which drive each neuron without correlation (Figure 3E); and (3) low-dimensional shared signals, which drive multiple neurons simultaneously, produce correlations, and constrain activity to the shared space containing all possible shared signals (Figure 3F). Thus, FA models the population’s total covariance matrix as the sum of the diagonal covariance matrix due to uncorrelated private signals and the low-rank covariance matrix due to shared signals, permitting variance only within the shared space (Figures 3D and 3G). Our use of private variance and shared variance specifically refers to their respective covariance matrices. We emphasize that FA is fit for each target separately on the full simultaneously recorded direct cell population, not just neuron pairs as illustrated for geometric intuition (Figures 3E–3J). Model fitting assessed the shared space dimensionality (number of shared signals) needed to best describe the firing rates (see STAR Methods). We used FA to analyze how the neural population’s private and shared variances change over learning (Figure 3D). First, the magnitude of total variance can change (Figure 3H). Second, the balance of shared and private variance can change, a measure of coordination that we quantified with the shared-to-total variance ratio (Figure 3I). Third, the shared space containing shared variance can change, which we quantified by calculating the alignment between two epochs’ shared variances (Figure 3J; STAR Methods). The shared space alignment, ranging between 0 and 1, asks how well Epoch B’s shared signals can approximate Epoch A’s shared signals. If Epochs A and B have perfectly aligned shared spaces, then the alignment is 1, and if the shared spaces are orthogonal, the alignment is 0. Thus, if the shared space stays fixed over learning, as predicted by constrained-network learning, we expect alignment values to be high throughout training. In contrast, if the shared space consolidates with learning, as predicted by flexible-network learning, we expect high alignment values only in late learning. We used these three analyses to study how private and shared sources of variance contribute to the exploration and consolidation of activity patterns. While previous studies have found trial-to-trial neural variability decreases for a particular intended action over motor learning, we used FA to ask how private and shared sources influenced trial-to-trial variability. We analyzed firing rate variability at the start of trials for each target separately. To avoid capturing within-trial variance used for control, we extracted one spike count vector from each trial in a large ∼1 s window locked to Go Cue (Figure 4A, left). Subjects’ trial times determined the window size (Monkey P, 0.9 s; Monkey R, 1.3 s; see STAR Methods for details), but the results were insensitive to window choice (Figures S4B–S4D). We assessed private trial-to-trial variability beyond that expected for a Poisson process by normalizing each neuron’s private variance by its mean rate (see STAR Methods). Shared trial-to-trial variability was calculated with each neuron’s un-normalized shared variance because in Poisson simulations, shared variance did not scale with the experimentally observed firing rates (Figure S5B). This analysis enabled us to disambiguate between independent neuron learning’s private trial-to-trial variability decrease, constrained-network learning’s shared trial-to-trial variability decrease, and flexible-network learning’s private trial-to-trial variability decrease and shared space consolidation. FA applied to a neuron pair in early and late training is shown for illustration (Figure 4A), showing a decrease in private trial-to-trial variability, an increase in shared-to-total variance ratio, and rotation of the shared space. At the direct cell population level, FA found only one shared dimension was needed for each target and epoch. Consistent with the example, we found initially large private trial-to-trial variability, which decreased prominently over training (Figures 4B and S2A). In contrast, shared trial-to-trial variability showed no significant trend, resulting in an increase in the shared-to-total variance ratio (un-normalized by firing rate) over long-term training (Figures 4C and S2C). These results suggest that neural activity space exploration in early learning was primarily accomplished with private trial-to-trial variability. The decrease in private trial-to-trial variability was correlated with success rate over training (Figures 4D and S2B), indicating the subjects produced desired activity as private trial-to-trial variability reduced. While the magnitude of shared trial-to-trial variability showed no change, its subspace consolidated over training. We assessed the shared space alignment between epoch pairs (Figure 4E, left; Figure S2D, left) and found the alignment with the final epoch’s shared space increased with training (Figure 4E, right; Figure S2D, right), correlating with the subject’s success rate (Figures 4F and S2E). Notably, the emergent shared space possessed a significantly different alignment from the initial shared space. Altogether, these results support flexible-network learning, showing that initial trial-to-trial variability is private to each neuron, and as private trial-to-trial variability decreased, the shared space evolved and consolidated. Having analyzed coarse-timescale trial-to-trial variability, we next zoomed in temporal resolution and asked how private and shared sources contributed to control-relevant activity at the decoder timescale of 100 ms bins (decoder bin size) for each target separately. Decoder-timescale neural variance can be interpreted as signal strength for BMI control, in contrast to our previous analysis on trial-to-trial variability. We thus use FA to study if the independent neuron, constrained-network, or flexible-network model best describes how learning changes decoder-timescale population activity driving control. We first observed population activity became lower dimensional, as the shared dimensionality describing the 100 ms spike counts within all trials to a single target decreased from ∼4 to ∼2 in late training (Figure 5B). Because the brain found a two-dimensional neural solution in late training, we compared shared variance over training in the two neural dimensions that captured the most shared variance, which we call the “main shared variance” (see STAR Methods). Note that high-dimensional shared variance did not constitute a significant fraction of total variance (Figure S5F). FA applied to a neuron pair in early and late training is shown for illustration, in which shared variance increased and rotated (Figure 5A). In concordance, in the entire direct cell population, we found main shared variance increased prominently while private variance decreased mildly over long-term training (Figures 5C and S3A), increasing the main shared-to-total variance ratio by a factor of ∼2 (Figures 5D and S3B). These results are not specific to our bin width selection, as they held over a range of bin sizes (Figure S4E). Further, main shared variance correlated with success rate (Figures 5E and S3C), suggesting that it was used for control. We next tested whether a shared space was consolidated over training for decoder-timescale variance. By analyzing the main shared space alignment, we found a period of relative instability in early learning followed by a period of stability in late learning (Figure 5F, left). Notably, the stable main shared space of late training was significantly different from the main shared spaces explored in early training (Figure 5F, right). Further, the alignment of main shared variance to the final epoch correlated with success rate (Figure 5G), suggesting main shared variance consolidation supported learning.

Moreover, elevated succinate acts as an inflammatory signal that induces secretion of IL-1α and stabilization of HIF-1α (4.Tannahill Tannahill Curtis Curtis Adamik Adamik Palsson-McDermott Palsson-McDermott McGettrick McGettrick Goel Goel Frezza Frezza Bernard Bernard Kelly Kelly Foley Foley Zheng Zheng Gardet Gardet Tong Tong Jany Jany Corr Corr et al.Succinate is an inflammatory signal that induces IL-1α through HIF-1α.Nature. 2013; 496: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2123) Google Scholar).

However, there is no direct evidence that itaconate or DMI can cross cell membranes and increase intracellular itaconate. Without direct evidence of intracellular delivery, it remains unclear whether itaconate-mediated metabolic and inflammatory effects are induced by increasing intracellular itaconate or by an extracellular mechanism. tricarboxylic acid cycle dimethyl itaconate hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography bone marrow-derived macrophage. Here we synthesized isotopically labeled [13C]itaconate and dimethyl [13C]itaconate ([13C]DMI) to directly profile itaconate metabolism and uptake (Fig. 1). This analysis suggests that exogenous itaconate is not taken up into cells and [13C]DMI is not metabolized into [13C]itaconate in bone marrow-derived macrophages. We also report that [13C]itaconate in the cell culture medium leads to elevated intracellular levels of unlabeled succinate, yet there is no evidence of intracellular uptake. Overall, this study highlights current limitations in intracellular itaconate delivery, and emphasizes the development of effective pro-drug strategies to conclusively define its action on macrophages and other cell and tissue types. Itaconate is a highly polar metabolite that is unlikely to cross into cells without the presence of an active transporter. Because no transporter has been identified, it remains unclear whether the addition of exogenous itaconate can affect intracellular itaconate levels. To test whether exogenous itaconate can enter cells, we treated RAW-264.7 cells with 10 mm itaconate neutralized with sodium hydroxide (pH 7). Cells were incubated for 2–3 h, and then rinsed and quenched. To reduce background signal from residual extracellular and cell surface-associated metabolites, cells were washed either once or twice with 150 mm ammonium acetate before freezing in liquid nitrogen as described previously (7.Lorenz Lorenz Burant Burant Kennedy Kennedy Reducing time and increasing sensitivity in sample preparation for adherent mammalian cell metabolomics.Anal. Chem. 2011; 83: 3406-3414Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The extracted metabolites were then analyzed by HILIC-LC/MS. The levels of citrate and succinate did not change significantly following the second wash. Conversely, itaconate levels fell more than 50% after the second wash, suggesting that much of the cell-associated itaconate signal is due to nonspecific association (Fig. 2A). Thus, analysis of cellular uptake is prone to misleading results, because any itaconate adsorbed to the cell surface would contribute to the measured cellular uptake. As reported previously (5.Cordes Cordes Wallace Wallace Michelucci Michelucci Divakaruni Divakaruni Sapcariu Sapcariu Sousa Sousa Koseki Koseki Cabrales Cabrales Murphy Murphy Hiller Hiller Metallo Metallo Immunoresponsive gene 1 and itaconate inhibit succinate dehydrogenase to modulate intracellular succinate levels.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 14274-14284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), we also found that the addition of exogenous itaconate elevates succinate levels in RAW cells and bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM) cells (data not shown). To evaluate whether this effect is caused by itaconate conversion to succinate, we treated mouse BMDM with increasing concentrations of [13C]itaconate (0–1000 μm). Similarly, the addition of [13C]itaconate increased levels of succinate in both LPS-stimulated and unstimulated cells. However, the accumulated succinate lacked the M+4 label, and thus cannot be the product of [13C]itaconate metabolism (Fig. 2B). Based on these results, itaconate is not metabolized by cells to form succinate. Intracellular delivery of polar carboxylate metabolites is typically achieved by synthesis of methyl or ethyl ester analogues, as has been done for succinate (8.MacDonald MacDonald Fahien Fahien Mertz Mertz Rana Rana Effect of esters of succinic acid and other citric acid cycle intermediates on insulin release and inositol phosphate formation by pancreatic islets.Arch.

This pro-drug strategy relies on methyl or ethyl ester hydrolysis by intracellular esterases, leaving the unmasked polar metabolite trapped inside cells. Methyl ester derivatives of DMI have been used to presumably deliver intracellular itaconate; however, the conversion of DMI to itaconate has not been demonstrated (6.Lampropoulou Lampropoulou Sergushichev Sergushichev Bambouskova Bambouskova Nair Nair Vincent Vincent Loginicheva Loginicheva Cervantes-Barragan Cervantes-Barragan Ma Ma Huang Huang Griss Griss Weinheimer Weinheimer Khader Khader Randolph Randolph Pearce Pearce Jones Jones et al.Itaconate links inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase with macrophage metabolic remodeling and regulation of inflammation.Cell Metab. 2016; 24: 158-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). To address this possibility, BMDM cells were incubated with vehicle or LPS along with a range of DMI concentrations, followed by LC-MS quantitation of intracellular itaconate (Fig. 2C). DMI treatment had no effect on itaconate levels in vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 2C). In contrast, LPS-stimulated cells revealed a dose-dependent increase in itaconate levels when incubated with increasing concentrations of DMI (Fig. 2C). From these data, we concluded either that DMI potentiates LPS-mediated de novo itaconate synthesis or that LPS stimulates cellular esterases to accelerate DMI methyl ester hydrolysis. To trace the intracellular fate of DMI, we synthesized isotopically labeled dimethyl [13C]itaconate, which, after esterase hydrolysis, would release the M+5 isotopomer of [13C]itaconate (see “Materials and Methods”). Vehicle-treated and LPS-stimulated BMDM macrophages were incubated with increasing concentrations of [13C]DMI. Again, only LPS-treated cells demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in unlabeled (M+0) itaconate (Fig. 2D). However, there was no measurable 13C-labeled (M+5) itaconate in either vehicle-treated or LPS-treated cells, suggesting either that DMI is not converted to itaconate or that the resulting itaconate is quickly excreted or further metabolized, without intracellular accumulation (Fig. 2D). Based on these findings, we conclude that exogenous DMI is not directly metabolized to itaconate, but instead somehow potentiates the effects of LPS activation to increase itaconate biosynthesis. How cells achieve alteration in metabolism, including amplification of itaconate and succinate production, following itaconate or DMI treatment will require further investigation. The findings here appear to reveal an alternative mode of dimethyl itaconate action. Importantly, although itaconate is not very electrophilic, methyl esterification is predicted to activate the electrophilic acrylate. Once introduced to cells, DMI could potentially alkylate active site of cysteine residues or alter redox homeostasis. Thus, we agree with previous studies (5.Cordes Cordes Wallace Wallace Michelucci Michelucci Divakaruni Divakaruni Sapcariu Sapcariu Sousa Sousa Koseki Koseki Cabrales Cabrales Murphy Murphy Hiller Hiller Metallo Metallo Immunoresponsive gene 1 and itaconate inhibit succinate dehydrogenase to modulate intracellular succinate levels.J.

However, these metabolic effects do not appear to be due to accumulation of intracellular itaconate, and could be the result of electrophilic stress and covalent inactivation of select metabolic enzymes. Alternatively, itaconate or DMI could bind to surface receptors, such as succinate receptor 1 (SUCNR1/GPR91), which is expressed on macrophages (11.Rubic Rubic Lametschwandtner Lametschwandtner Jost Jost Hinteregger Hinteregger Kund Kund Carballido-Perrig Carballido-Perrig Schwärzler Schwärzler Junt Junt Voshol Voshol Meingassner Meingassner Mao Mao Werner Werner Rot Rot Carballido Carballido Triggering the succinate receptor GPR91 on dendritic cells enhances immunity.Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 1261-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), or an as yet unknown receptor to modulate macrophage activation, and thus act entirely extracellularly. It is tempting to speculate that accumulation of extracellular itaconate, which may occur following macrophage death, could provide an amplification signal to enhance the inflammatory activity of local macrophages. Indeed, a recent study has found that succinate release into the extracellular fluid in a model of antigen-induced arthritis can increase macrophage production of IL-α, in a GPR91-dependent manner (12.Littlewood-Evans Littlewood-Evans Sarret Sarret Apfel Apfel Loesle Loesle Dawson Dawson Zhang Zhang Muller Muller Tigani Tigani Kneuer Kneuer Patel Patel Valeaux Valeaux Gommermann Gommermann Rubic-Schneider Rubic-Schneider Junt Junt Carballido Carballido GPR91 senses extracellular succinate released from inflammatory macrophages and exacerbates rheumatoid arthritis.J. Exp. Med. 2016; 213: 1655-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Finally, suitable pro-drugs are needed to manipulate intracellular itaconate levels to probe its exact role in the mechanism of macrophage activation and stimulation. Future pro-drug strategies to introduce itaconate into cells should avoid enhancing the electrophilicity of the conjugated acrylate, and focus on selective esterification or amidation of the distal carboxylate. Dimethyl itaconate and itaconic acid were purchased from Sigma (part numbers 109533 and I29204). [13C5]Itaconic acid was synthesized by the Metabolite Standards Synthesis Core at SRI International, arranged through the National Institutes of Health Common Fund's Metabolomics Initiative (13.Sud Sud Fahy Fahy Cotter Cotter Azam Azam Vadivelu Vadivelu Burant Burant Edison Edison Fiehn Fiehn Higashi Higashi Nair Nair Sumner Sumner Subramaniam Subramaniam Metabolomics Workbench: an international repository for metabolomics data and metadata, metabolite standards, protocols, tutorials and training, and analysis tools.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44: D463-D470Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). [13C5]Itaconic acid dimethyl ester ([13C]DMI) was synthesized by the following procedure. A magnetic stir bar was added to a 10-ml dry round-bottom flask. Next, 5 ml of methanol was added, the flask was cooled to 0 °C on ice, and 1 ml of thionyl chloride was slowly added while stirring. [13C5]Itaconic acid (22 mg, 0.17 mmol) was dissolved in 1 ml of methanol, and then added dropwise to the mixture under a positive pressure of nitrogen for 1 h. The reaction was then warmed to room temperature and stirred overnight. TLC analysis indicated the consumption of starting materials. The solvent was gently removed by rotary evaporation, and the residue was directly purified by flash chromatography eluted with MeOH in dichloromethane (0–5%). Pure fractions of [13C5]itaconic acid dimethyl ester were collected (20 mg, 73%). The product was confirmed by NMR. Using 1H NMR (401 MHz, CDCl3): δ 6.75 − 6.00 (m, 1H), 5.98 − 5.36 (m, 1H), 3.75 (dd, J = 3.9, 1.0 Hz, 3H), 3.68 (dd, J = 3.9, 1.0 Hz, 3H), 3.32 (ddt, J = 130.2, 8.4, 4.7 Hz, 2H), while for 13C NMR (101 MHz, CDCl3) δ 171.28 (dt, J = 58.7, 3.3 Hz), 166.76 (dd, J = 71.8, 3.2 Hz), 133.74 (tdd, J = 72.1, 46.6, 3.0 Hz), 131.05 − 126.04 (m), 37.62 (dddd, J = 58.7, 46.7, 3.3, 1.8 Hz). Product was also confirmed by high resolution mass spectrometry (Fig. 1). [13C5]Itaconic acid was synthesized by pyrolyzing [13C6]citric acid to [13C5]itaconic anhydride followed by hydrolysis to give [13C5]itaconic acid with an isotopic purity of 99%. 3L. Jong, L.

https://openalex.org/W2587305157,"Habenula (Hb) plays critical roles in emotion-related behaviors through integrating inputs mainly from the limbic system and basal ganglia. However, Hb also receives inputs from multiple sensory modalities. The function and underlying neural circuit of Hb sensory inputs remain unknown. Using larval zebrafish, we found that left dorsal Hb (dHb, a homolog of mammalian medial Hb) mediates light-preference behavior by receiving visual inputs from a specific subset of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) through eminentia thalami (EmT). Loss- and gain-of-function manipulations showed that left, but not right, dHb activities, which encode environmental illuminance, are necessary and sufficient for light-preference behavior. At circuit level, left dHb neurons receive excitatory monosynaptic inputs from bilateral EmT, and EmT neurons are contacted mainly by sustained ON-type RGCs at the arborization field 4 of retinorecipient brain areas. Our findings discover a previously unidentified asymmetrical visual pathway to left Hb and its function in mediating light-preference behavior. VIDEO ABSTRACT."
https://openalex.org/W2588412823,"To ensure efficient genome duplication, cells have evolved numerous factors that promote unperturbed DNA replication and protect, repair and restart damaged forks. Here we identify downstream neighbor of SON (DONSON) as a novel fork protection factor and report biallelic DONSON mutations in 29 individuals with microcephalic dwarfism. We demonstrate that DONSON is a replisome component that stabilizes forks during genome replication. Loss of DONSON leads to severe replication-associated DNA damage arising from nucleolytic cleavage of stalled replication forks. Furthermore, ATM- and Rad3-related (ATR)-dependent signaling in response to replication stress is impaired in DONSON-deficient cells, resulting in decreased checkpoint activity and the potentiation of chromosomal instability. Hypomorphic mutations in DONSON substantially reduce DONSON protein levels and impair fork stability in cells from patients, consistent with defective DNA replication underlying the disease phenotype. In summary, we have identified mutations in DONSON as a common cause of microcephalic dwarfism and established DONSON as a critical replication fork protein required for mammalian DNA replication and genome stability."
https://openalex.org/W2588498659,"Expression of the MECOM (also known as EVI1) proto-oncogene is deregulated by chromosomal translocations in some cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is associated with poor clinical outcome. Here, through transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling of hematopoietic cells, we reveal that EVI1 overexpression alters cellular metabolism. A screen using pooled short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) identified the ATP-buffering, mitochondrial creatine kinase CKMT1 as necessary for survival of EVI1-expressing cells in subjects with EVI1-positive AML. EVI1 promotes CKMT1 expression by repressing the myeloid differentiation regulator RUNX1. Suppression of arginine-creatine metabolism by CKMT1-directed shRNAs or by the small molecule cyclocreatine selectively decreased the viability, promoted the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of human EVI1-positive cell lines, and prolonged survival in both orthotopic xenograft models and mouse models of primary AML. CKMT1 inhibition altered mitochondrial respiration and ATP production, an effect that was abrogated by phosphocreatine-mediated reactivation of the arginine-creatine pathway. Targeting CKMT1 is thus a promising therapeutic strategy for this EVI1-driven AML subtype that is highly resistant to current treatment regimens."
https://openalex.org/W2587564992,"Receptors implicated in cough hypersensitivity are transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), transient receptor potential cation channel, Subfamily A, Member 1 (TRPA1) and acid sensing ion channel receptor 3 (ASIC3). Respiratory viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and measles virus (MV) may interact directly and/or indirectly with these receptors on sensory nerves and epithelial cells in the airways. We used in vitro models of sensory neurones (SHSY5Y or differentiated IMR-32 cells) and human bronchial epithelium (BEAS-2B cells) as well as primary human bronchial epithelial cells (PBEC) to study the effect of MV and RSV infection on receptor expression. Receptor mRNA and protein levels were examined by qPCR and flow cytometry, respectively, following infection or treatment with UV inactivated virus, virus-induced soluble factors or pelleted virus. Concentrations of a range of cytokines in resultant BEAS-2B and PBEC supernatants were determined by ELISA. Up-regulation of TRPV1, TRPA1 and ASICS3 expression occurred by 12 hours post-infection in each cell type. This was independent of replicating virus, within the same cell, as virus-induced soluble factors alone were sufficient to increase channel expression. IL-8 and IL-6 increased in infected cell supernatants. Antibodies against these factors inhibited TRP receptor up-regulation. Capsazepine treatment inhibited virus induced up-regulation of TRPV1 indicating that these receptors are targets for treating virus-induced cough."

We call here for the formation of new relationships between academic drug discovery centers and commercial partners, which can accelerate the development of truly transformative drugs at sustainable prices. The spiraling cost of new drugs mandates a fundamentally different approach to keep lifesaving therapies affordable for cancer patients. We call here for the formation of new relationships between academic drug discovery centers and commercial partners, which can accelerate the development of truly transformative drugs at sustainable prices. The recently developed targeted drugs and immunotherapies deliver significant benefit to cancer patients. However, the spiraling prices of these new drugs threaten the financial sustainability of cancer treatment. Healthcare spending has risen sharply in the United States, reaching 17.1% of the gross domestic product in 2014. Cancer drugs are of particular concern, even if they only represent a fraction of the overall costs. As early as 2012, 12 of the 13 newly-approved cancer drugs were priced above $100,000 annually, and the situation has only gotten worse since (Light and Kantarjian, 2013Light D.W. Kantarjian H. Cancer. 2013; 119: 3900-3902Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, Mailankody and Prasad, 2015Mailankody S. Prasad V. JAMA Oncol. 2015; 1: 539-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Particularly worrisome is the notion that these drugs often need to be combined for optimal clinical results. For instance, the cost of the combination of nivolumab (anti-PD-1) and ipilimumab (anti-CTLA4) is priced around $252,000, exceeding the median cost of a US home ($240,000 in 2016). With a lifetime risk of developing cancer of close to 40%, the problem is clear. The pharmaceutical industry has traditionally defended these high prices by pointing at the high attrition rate during clinical drug development and the cost of large registration studies. But are these arguments still as sturdy in the new era of personalized medicine? Targeted cancer drugs are often genotype-selective, which makes for a higher success rate due to better upfront patient selection. Consequently, approval of such drugs often no longer requires expensive phase III trials with thousands of patients. As one example, the registration study of the ALK inhibitor crizotinib required only 347 patients with ALK-positive lung cancer (Shaw et al., 2013Shaw A.T. Kim D.-W. Nakagawa K. Seto T. Crinó L. Ahn M.-J. De Pas T. Besse B. Solomon B.J. Blackhall F. et al.N. Engl. J. Med. 2013; 368: 2385-2394Crossref PubMed Scopus (2847) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in 2016 FDA approved crizotinib for the treatment of lung cancer patients with mutations in ROS1, which the drug also inhibits, on the basis of a study of only 50 patients (Shaw et al., 2014Shaw A.T. Ou S.H. Bang Y.J. Camidge D.R. Solomon B.J. Salgia R. Riely G.J. Varella-Garcia M. Shapiro G.I. Costa D.B. et al.N. Engl. J. Med. 2014; 371: 1963-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (1425) Google Scholar). So why are drug prices going up instead of down? One clue can be gleaned from the pricing of the recent checkpoint blockade immunotherapeutics nivolumab and pembrolizumab. Both drugs received initial FDA approvals in 2014 for metastatic melanoma, but their indication was widened in 2015 to include certain lung cancers and renal cancer (nivolumab) and in 2016 to head and neck cancer (pembrolizumab) and Hodgkin lymphoma (nivolumab). If development cost would be a major factor in the pricing structure, a simple law of economics would have mandated a considerable reduction in price when the eligible patient population increases, but that has hardly happened. This is a recurring theme in pharma. For instance, trastuzumab was first approved for advanced breast cancer and later also for early disease (adjuvant) without a reduction in price. Healthcare payers should not accept this lack of price-volume relationship. Moreover, there is very little relationship between drug price and clinical benefit (Mailankody and Prasad, 2015Mailankody S. Prasad V. JAMA Oncol. 2015; 1: 539-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). This has sparked widespread criticism, alleging that cancer drug pricing is primarily based on “what the market will bear.” There is a clear and urgent necessity to lower cancer drug prices to keep lifesaving drugs available and affordable for patients. As one patient advocate recently put it: “Innovation is meaningless if nobody can afford it.” Much has been written about the reasons behind the exorbitant drug prices and what to do about it. One recurring theme is the notion that the US federal government is prohibited by law from negotiating drug prices as a result of the 2003 Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act. Considering that Medicare and Medicaid spend $ 140 billion on medicines annually, this represents a serious impediment in driving down drug prices. Lack of competition and a general absence of a connection between drug price, sales volume, and clinical performance are other arguments in the drug pricing discussion (Jaffe, 2015Jaffe S. Lancet. 2015; 386: 2127-2128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Indeed, lack of competition and bargaining power made US prices of cancer drugs among the highest in the world, increasing by 10% annually between 1995 and 2013, far above the average inflation rate (Howard et al., 2015Howard D.H. Bach P.B. Berndt E.R. Conti R.M. J. Econ. Perspect. 2015; 29: 139-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). While negotiations may bring prices down, a recent cost comparison in EU countries shows that the ability of individual nations to negotiate discounts is limited, most likely due to the modest market sizes of the EU countries (van Harten et al., 2016van Harten W.H. Wind A. de Paoli P. Saghatchian M. Oberst S. Lancet Oncol. 2016; 17: 18-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In the longer term, it is unlikely that the European Union will be able to collectively negotiate with the pharmaceutical industry, given that some nations in the EU with a large pharma sector are likely to protect their national interests. The UK’s pioneering National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has been able to restrain prices to £30,000 per “quality-adjusted life year” (QUALY) added or £50,000 per QUALY for “end of life” treatments that include many cancer drugs—but this has also resulted in many oncology agents being turned down or delayed, leading to complaints from patient groups and manufacturers. There is also increasing evidence of pressure on pricing in the US. Researchers at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center have developed an online tool called Drug Abacus to help healthcare providers assess the value of cancer drugs (www.drugabacus.org/). What is urgently needed however are mechanisms to encourage scientific and therapeutic innovations that will allow cancer patients to access new treatments at affordable and sustainable prices. One element that contributes significantly to the high cost of cancer drugs is the inefficiency of the overall commercial enterprise. As one recent example, there are currently 803 clinical trials testing checkpoint immune-therapeutics (at least 12 antibodies from a dozen different pharma companies), which together plan to enroll over 166,000 patients (Brawley, 2016Brawley L. Cancer Lett. 2016; 42: 2-18Google Scholar). There is enormous redundancy in these studies, as many pharmaceutical companies perform similar trials with comparable drugs, but fail to share the data generated. This herd mentality is caused in part by the notion that immune checkpoint therapies can indeed lead to long-lasting remissions (potentially even to cures) and that significant numbers of patients in each clinical indication benefit from these treatments. While it is in the short-term good that so many patients get access to potentially lifesaving drugs, in the longer term, patients will have to pay the price for this inefficiency and duplication. Another factor is the frequent absence of a rigorous biomarker program to identify patients who may benefit from a given drug. The primary incentive of the pharma industry is to increase sales, which are restricted by identifying drug-responsive subpopulations. Biomarkers are critical, as they represent a handle to control drugs costs to society. Regulatory bodies should set standards for drug approval employing validated and clinically useful biomarkers for patient selection. This will prevent patients being treated with toxic drugs that do not improve survival and/or quality of life and will save costs to society. Historically, some 90% of all drugs entering the clinic have failed at some stage and most biotech start-ups have a similar fate. This severe attrition rate in drug discovery and development has been attributed to various factors, including failure to validate drug targets with sufficient rigor; limited predictive value of animal models; inability to firmly identify tumor subtypes that might benefit from treatment; poorly defined clinical endpoints; organizational pressure to continue clinical development, such as stock market considerations for small one-product biotech firms; and senior management fear of admiting defeat in larger pharma. The Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development has estimated that the development of a drug on average costs $2.558 billion, but it is difficult to determine how this was calculated—and includes costs of failed projects and controversially incorporates selected examples of successful drugs and the cost of capital (Avorn, 2015Avorn J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2015; 372: 1877-1879Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Some consideration should be given to the fact that large pharmaceutical companies encounter significant challenges due to the large size of their operations, redundant activities at multiple sites, huge infrastructure costs, heavily matrixed organizations with multiple levels of decision makers, and endless rounds of restructuring, mergers, acquisitions and down-sizing—which all ultimately contribute to time delays (time is money!), reduced productivity, and increased expenses. Smaller biotech start-ups have significant challenges as well, with tremendous recent increases in space and infrastructure build-up costs and competition for talent (with consequent increased employee salaries), particularly in the Boston and San Francisco communities. Furthermore, all commercial entities, large and small, spend very significant sums on hefty salaries for senior management. We therefore assume that both organizational and scientific inefficiencies contribute to escalating drug development costs. Many of the fundamental discoveries that formed the basis for new categories of cancer drugs were made by academia. Examples of truly disruptive contributions from academic research that enabled radically different treatment strategies include the identification of recurrent mutations in cancers from the large-sale sequencing efforts (enabling targeted therapeutics) and the decades-long investments in unraveling the basic biology underlying recognition of cancer cells by the immune system (enabling recent immuno-oncology drugs). The National Cancer Institute budget of over 5 billion dollars annually virtually guarantees that this stream of innovations in oncology drug targets from academia will not dry up any time soon. It should also be recognized that academic drug discovery has already been very successful as several drugs that are part of the therapeutic armamentarium have been developed by academic researchers, e.g., the brain tumor DNA alkylating drug temozolomide and the prostate cancer CYP17 inhibitor agent abiraterone, as well as the biomarker strategy for the PARP inhibitor olaparib in BRCA mutant ovarian cancer patients. To further develop these academic discoveries, the traditional model of self-supporting research investigators who drive their independent research programs needs to be complemented by concerted multidisciplinary team efforts that are adequately financed and staffed with scientists having all the required expertise to enable drug discovery (Frye et al., 2011Frye S. Crosby M. Edwards T. Juliano R. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2011; 10: 409-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, Schultz Kirkegaard and Valentin, 2014Schultz Kirkegaard H. Valentin F. Drug Discov. Today. 2014; 19: 1699-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Indeed, in recent years there has already been a steady increase in the number of academic centers involved in drug discovery. The Cancer Research UK Cancer Therapeutics Unit at The Institute of Cancer Research, London (www.icr.ac.uk/our-research/our-research-centres/cancer-research-uk-cancer-therapeutics-unit) and the Institute for Applied Cancer Science at MDAnderson cancer center (www.mdanderson.org/cancermoonshots/research_platforms/Institute_for_applied_cancer_science.html) are just two examples of relatively large-scale academic cancer drug discovery units that have been established to date. The Academic Drug Discovery consortium currently lists 146 drug discovery centers in 15 countries, 80% of which have programs in oncology drug development (www.addconsortium.org/). A key advantage of academic drug discovery is the freedom and indeed incentivization to tackle major challenges that would be viewed as too risky by big pharma and even by many biotech companies. Currently only a fraction of the cancer genes listed in the Cancer Gene Census have drugs or chemical leads that act on the cognate protein. This means that there are very large numbers of cancer genes that remain to be drugged. For example, we have no drugs that work directly on mutant KRAS, mutant p53 or MYC. Hence there is a huge amount of work to be done to complete the job of drugging of the cancer genome. Moreover, there are gene classes that do not fall into the conventional categories of oncogene addiction and synthetic lethality targets, including non-oncogene addiction, microenvironmental, drug resistance and immuno-oncology targets. Tackling any one of these new targets carries very high risk—either biological risk because there is relatively little knowledge of the role of the gene in cancer, or technical risk because the protein is not readily druggable by current technology. These are the targets for which academic drug discovery can make an enormous impact in a number of ways. For example: (1) conducting very rigorous target validation to ensure robustness of the effects; (2) linkage of the sensitivity to a robust biomarker that can be potentially used for patient selection as well as pharmacodynamic biomarkers to demonstrate target engagement as part of a Pharmacologic Audit Trail (Banerji and Workman, 2016Banerji U. Workman P. Semin. Oncol. 2016; 43: 436-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar); (3) demonstration of druggability by a small molecule approach; (4) production of chemical probe or biological reagent that demonstrates proof of concept in a disease-relevant animal model; (5) progression of a candidate drug through preclinical development; and (6) conduct of an early stage clinical trial to show tolerability and proof of concept in cancer patients (Hoelder et al., 2012Hoelder S. Clarke P.A. Workman P. Mol. Oncol. 2012; 6: 155-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Factors that have improved the success of cancer drug discovery efforts in academia include embedding experienced drug discovery scientists within a comprehensive cancer center that provides expertise in basic cancer research, clinical trials and treatment. The recruitment of experienced medicinal chemists and drug discovery biologists has been critical. Adequate funding and resources to support a portfolio of projects as well the range of expertise and technologies is important as is experienced leadership and decision-making. Once new chemical entities have been developed and tested in experimental animals, the (mostly academic) hospitals become involved in the three major phases of clinical testing of compounds. Selected Good Laboratory Practice and Good Manufacturing Practice-certified academic pharmacies can develop and manufacture oral and/or parenteral drug formulations fit for clinical use. Academic clinicians clearly have the skills to execute large clinical trials, especially given that some of the recent large clinical trials were “investigator initiated,” meaning that an academic investigator was leading the study. Based on the arguments above, it is evident that academia in principle has all the tools and skill sets to discover drug targets, to convert these targets into clinical candidates and to test these compounds rigorously in clinical trials. There are three main reasons why academic drug development typically stalls at the stage of clinical testing. First, the stringent quality control over the large-scale manufacturing of clinical grade drugs and their formulation is not a routine skill of academic groups. Second, the funds to support the high cost of performing non-clinical regulatory toxicology studies and clinical trials are hard to raise by non-profit organizations. Third, even when these first two steps could be executed, academic drug discovery and development units are not equipped to handle marketing and sales of approved drugs. Yet, it is at the level of commercialization that the interests of large pharma to maximize return on investment are diagonally disparate from the typically idealistic motivation that drives most academics to spend countless hours at modest compensation to solve important problems in oncology. Nevertheless, academics are driven into the arms of big pharma after initial proof of concept clinical trials for the reasons listed above. While it is gratifying for most academic investigators to see their discoveries reach the clinic, it leaves them unable to influence the pricing of “their” drugs when they reach the market. There are examples of charities funding later stage trials, but these are exceptions and academic drug discovery cannot rely on charity funding only to bring their candidates to patients. How can we break free of this catch 22 situation in academic drug development? A possible solution may reside in what happens to cancer drugs when their patents expire. At this point so-called “generic” drug makers bring generic versions (biosimilars in the case of biological agents) to the market at greatly reduced prices. These lower prices are possible because the companies do not bear the cost of research and development. Given that generic drug makers are used to working with lower profit margins, they may be one potential partner to develop highly innovative, but de-risked, drugs from academic drug discovery and development (Figure 1). Especially when the drugs have a strong mechanistic rationale and an associated biomarker of response (key aspects of academic drug development), the registration trials can be small and the success rate much higher than in traditional pharma trials. As a result, the prices of such drugs can be far lower than we have witnessed recently. Regulatory bodies are also open to novel ways for drug approval. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has launched an adaptive licensing program enabling companies to obtain marketing authorization approval on the basis of a small well designed, biomarker supported trial. Post-marketing commitments of the company forcing them and the community to deliver extended proof of benefit at acceptable risk is a safeguard to them and the community that the early market launch was justified. If such commitments are not met, the drug will be withdrawn. Two elements will be mission critical for this model to succeed. First, academic organizations will need to abide by their societal responsibility and resist the temptation to sell their drug candidate to the highest bidder. Second, it will be imperative that agreements on price caps are part of the negotiations with potential investors or with companies that take forward drugs arising from academic drug development. Ideally, this approach would also be accompanied by pricing strategy leading to affordable drug cost in middle- and low-income countries, thereby reducing inequality in global cancer therapy. Given the substantial de-risking achieved prior to commercialization, our model should be attractive to these parties and their investors. The academic drug discovery and development units could be sustained in this model by receiving royalties on sales of the drugs they originated. We need to recognize that building up a collection of academic centers with required scale and expertise that would produce significant numbers of drug candidates will take time and money and will not be an overnight solution to the global pricing problem. It is, however, a move in the right direction. Moreover, the creation of such groups alongside generics partners or newly created commercial entities will create competition and drive down prices in conventional pharma and biotech. There is quite a bit of low hanging fruit to be harvested by academic consortia. In addition to their main task of discovering mechanistically innovative drugs, a near term focus should be on the repurposing of existing patent-expired drugs by finding new indications for these drugs, linked to effective biomarkers that are predictive of response. Academic groups are well equipped to carry out this research, and it would help if specific funding mechanisms would be made available for such projects. We emphasize that such funds should not be allocated at the expense of investments in fundamental cancer research. Second, academic consortia should also focus on finding effective combinations for drugs that were abandoned for lack of single agent activity, which appears in one out of three cases to be the primary reason new chemical entities are dropped from early phase clinical trials (Dimasi, 2001Dimasi J.A. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 2001; 69: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Lack of single agent activity is often caused by redundancy or feedback in signaling pathways, which makes the inhibition of a single pathway ineffective without concomitant inhibition of the redundant or feedback pathway. As one example, had the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib been tested initially in BRAF mutant colon cancer, it would have been discarded as ineffective, whereas it turned out to be very effective in BRAF mutant melanoma. We argue that far too many potentially useful drugs are discarded early for the wrong reasons. Besides tackling these initial lower risk projects, which can serve as a proof of concept (and cash flow) for the model proposed here, the academic drug discovery centers should have as a major emphasis the challenging task of discovering and developing drugs against highly innovative drug targets emerging from academic research. Such efforts must have a sharp focus on mechanism-based therapies with strong associated biomarkers of response to reduce attrition rates while allowing small clinical trials to show efficacy. By partnering with generic drug makers or new companies specifically formed to enable this new model, academic drug discovery units and interested drug makers can lead by example and deliver innovative drugs at sustainable prices.

https://openalex.org/W2588928653,"The voltage-gated cardiac Na+ channel (Nav1.5), encoded by the SCN5A gene, conducts the inward depolarizing cardiac Na+ current (INa) and is vital for normal cardiac electrical activity. Inherited loss-of-function mutations in SCN5A lead to defects in the generation and conduction of the cardiac electrical impulse and are associated with various arrhythmia phenotypes. Here we show that sirtuin 1 deacetylase (Sirt1) deacetylates Nav1.5 at lysine 1479 (K1479) and stimulates INa via lysine-deacetylation-mediated trafficking of Nav1.5 to the plasma membrane. Cardiac Sirt1 deficiency in mice induces hyperacetylation of K1479 in Nav1.5, decreases expression of Nav1.5 on the cardiomyocyte membrane, reduces INa and leads to cardiac conduction abnormalities and premature death owing to arrhythmia. The arrhythmic phenotype of cardiac-Sirt1-deficient mice recapitulated human cardiac arrhythmias resulting from loss of function of Nav1.5. Increased Sirt1 activity or expression results in decreased lysine acetylation of Nav1.5, which promotes the trafficking of Nav1.5 to the plasma membrane and stimulation of INa. As compared to wild-type Nav1.5, Nav1.5 with K1479 mutated to a nonacetylatable residue increases peak INa and is not regulated by Sirt1, whereas Nav1.5 with K1479 mutated to mimic acetylation decreases INa. Nav1.5 is hyperacetylated on K1479 in the hearts of patients with cardiomyopathy and clinical conduction disease. Thus, Sirt1, by deacetylating Nav1.5, plays an essential part in the regulation of INa and cardiac electrical activity."
https://openalex.org/W2586554985,"FRET is an indispensable experimental tool for studying membrane proteins. Currently, two models are available for researchers to determine the oligomerization state of membrane proteins in a static quenching FRET experiment: the model of Veatch and Stryer, derived in 1977, and the kinetic theory-based model for intraoligomeric FRET, derived in 2007. Because of confinement in two dimensions, a substantial amount of FRET is generated by energy transfer between fluorophores located in separate oligomers in the two-dimensional bilayer. This interoligomeric FRET (also known as stochastic, bystander, or proximity FRET) is not accounted for in either model. Here, we use the kinetic theory formalism to describe the dependence of the FRET efficiency measured in an experiment (i.e. the “total apparent FRET efficiency”) on the interoligomeric FRET due to random proximity within the bilayer and the intraoligomeric FRET resulting from protein-protein interactions. We find that data analysis with both models without consideration of the proximity FRET leads to incorrect conclusions about the oligomeric state of the protein. We show that knowledge of the total surface densities of fluorophore-labeled membrane proteins is essential for correctly interpreting the measured total apparent FRET efficiency. We also find that bulk, two-color, static quenching FRET experiments are best suited for the study of monomeric, dimerizing, or dimeric proteins but have limitations in discerning the order of larger oligomers. The theory and methodology described in this work will allow researchers to extract meaningful parameters from static quenching FRET measurements in biological membranes.

Many recent investigations of the function and interaction mode of membrane proteins in the plasma membrane, such as G-protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases, have been enabled through the use of fluorescence microscopy (1.Böhme I.

FRET, a quantum mechanical transfer of energy from an optically excited donor to an acceptor over distances usually limited to about 10 nm, is a property of certain pairs of fluorophores, like the fluorescent proteins mTurquoise and YFP (8.Shaner N.C. Steinbach P.A. Tsien R.Y. A guide to choosing fluorescent proteins.Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (2288) Google Scholar). These fluorescent proteins are attached to membrane proteins of interest, and when these tagged proteins dimerize or oligomerize, intraoligomeric FRET can occur from the excited donor to a nearby acceptor, resulting in quenched donor emission and enhanced emission from the acceptor (9.Forster T. Intermolecular energy migration and fluorescence.Annalen Physik. 1948; 2: 55-75Crossref Scopus (4910) Google Scholar, 10.Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy.

Due to the short distances over which FRET can occur (∼1–10 nm), FRET is often referred to as a “molecular ruler” (12.Wang X.F. Herman B. Fluorescence Imaging Spectroscopy and Microscopy.

However, FRET between donor- and acceptor-tagged membrane proteins does not exclusively occur intraoligomerically (i.e. within dimers or oligomers). Non-negligible interoligomeric proximity FRET (also known as stochastic or bystander FRET) can also occur between donor- and acceptor-labeled membrane proteins that belong to different oligomers (or monomers) as a result of fluorophore confinement in two dimensions and total surface density (4.King C. Sarabipour S. Byrne P. Leahy D.J. Hristova K. The FRET signatures of non-interacting proteins in membranes: simulations and experiments.Biophys.

Fluorescence energy transfer in two dimensions: a numeric solution for random and nonrandom distributions.Biophys. J. 1982; 40: 137-148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This interoligomeric FRET occurs simply because membrane proteins belonging to different oligomers find themselves within close proximity (i.e. within ∼10 nm) in the bilayer. The magnitude of the proximity FRET is known to be a function of the membrane protein oligomerization state and the acceptor surface density but is not well understood from a theoretical standpoint. The function of receptors in the cell membrane is often modulated by their lateral association in the membrane into dimers or higher order oligomers (20.Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J.

Thus, the association state of a membrane protein (monomer, dimer, oligomer, etc.) is of primary interest. Bulk, static-quenching FRET is often the method of choice in the study of the association state (23.Mishra A.K. Mavlyutov T. Singh D.R. Biener G. Yang J. Oliver J.A. Ruoho A. Raicu V.

Parameters of interest in such studies are the number of proteins in a functional oligomer and the value of the intrinsic FRET or pairwise FRET efficiency (27.Chen L. Novicky L. Merzlyakov M.

FRET-based determination of protein complex structure at nanometer length scale in living cells.in: Diaspro A. Nanoscopy: Multidimensional Optical Fluorescence Microscopy.

Two models are currently in use for the analysis of static quenching FRET experimental data (28.Raicu, V., Stoneman, M. R., Fung, R., Melnichuk, M., Jansma, D. B., Pisterzi, L. F., Rath, S., Fox, M., Wells, J. W., and Saldin, D. K. (2008) Determination of supramolecular structure and spatial distribution of protein complexes in living cells Nat.

A rigorous experimental framework for detecting protein oligomerization using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer.Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 1001-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The first is the Veatch and Stryer model (31.Veatch W. Stryer L. The dimeric nature of the gramicidin A transmembrane channel: conductance and fluorescence energy transfer studies of hybrid channels.J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 113: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), derived in 1977, which is often utilized in semiquantitative experiments to determine the oligomeric state of the membrane proteins. In these experiments, the donor/acceptor ratio is known, but the total surface density of donor- and acceptor-labeled receptors is unknown or is not utilized in the analysis. The second model is the theory of intraoligomeric FRET based on the kinetic theory formalism, proposed in 2007 (32.Raicu V. Efficiency of resonance energy transfer in homo-oligomeric complexes of proteins.J. Biol. Phys. 2007; 33: 109-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), which derives its relations from an explicit consideration of rates of energy transfer and donor/acceptor combinatorics in ensembles of labeled oligomers. The full kinetic theory of intraoligomeric FRET can be greatly simplified by assuming a single donor-acceptor distance in the oligomer, and this simplified theory is often used to analyze fully quantitative FRET experiments where the total surface densities of donor- and acceptor-labeled membrane proteins are known or measured but the oligomeric state is unknown and is of interest (32.Raicu V. Efficiency of resonance energy transfer in homo-oligomeric complexes of proteins.J. Biol. Phys. 2007; 33: 109-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Neither the model of Veatch and Stryer nor the kinetic theory of intraoligomeric FRET account for the interoligomeric proximity FRET that occurs with labeled membrane proteins. Here we use the kinetic theory formalism to describe the theoretical dependence of the total FRET efficiency measured in a static quenching FRET experiment, the “total apparent FRET efficiency,” on the interoligomeric proximity FRET and on the intraoligomeric FRET due to protein-protein interactions. We then utilize computer simulations of the measured total apparent FRET efficiency to study the consequences of ignoring proximity FRET when interpreting experimental results with both the model of Veatch and Stryer and the kinetic theory of FRET-based model. We also study the limitations of these models in deducing the oligomerization state of labeled membrane proteins. We find that data analysis without consideration of proximity FRET leads to incorrect conclusions about the oligomeric state of the protein with both models. We show that knowledge of the total surface densities of fluorophore-labeled membrane proteins is essential for the correct interpretation of the measured total apparent FRET efficiency because only the kinetic theory formalism is able to extract the proper oligomerization state. We find that bulk, two-color static quenching FRET experiments are best suited for the study of monomeric, dimerizing, or dimeric proteins and that there are limitations in the determination of higher order oligomerization states. Further, we find that for low values of intrinsic FRET in the oligomer, even dimerization may be difficult to discern from higher order oligomerization in a bulk static quenching FRET experiment, despite the correct account of proximity FRET. The total (donor-quenched) apparent FRET efficiency, Eapp, is defined as the ratio of the rate of resonance energy transfer, kRET, to the overall rate of all donor de-excitation pathways, including FRET, according to Equation 1. Eapp≡kRETkD+kRET(Eq. 1) Here kD denotes the sum of all the donor de-excitation rates excluding FRET. When the fluorophores are confined to two dimensions, interoligomeric proximity FRET can occur between a donor within an oligomer and the distribution of acceptors in different oligomers surrounding it, in addition to the intraoligomeric FRET caused by protein-protein interactions (18.Wolber P.K. Hudson B.S. An analytic solution to the Förster energy transfer problem in two dimensions.Biophys. J. 1979; 28: 197-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). This concept is described mathematically in the kinetic theory formalism by breaking apart kRET into the sum of two components: kREToligo, the rate of donor de-excitation due to FRET between donors and acceptors within an oligomer, and kRETprox, the rate of donor de-excitation due to interoligomeric proximity FRET caused by spatial proximity to neighboring acceptors in other oligomers. Thus, we have the following. Eapp=kRETprox+kREToligokD+kRETprox+kREToligo(Eq. 2) As described previously (4.King C. Sarabipour S. Byrne P. Leahy D.J. Hristova K. The FRET signatures of non-interacting proteins in membranes: simulations and experiments.Biophys. J. 2014; 106: 1309-1317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), this proximity FRET contribution is a non-negligible component of the total apparent FRET efficiency and is a function of the concentration, interaction propensity, and oligomerization state of the fluorescent protein-tagged membrane proteins. In an ideal experimental situation, kRETprox = 0, and a measurement of Eapp would yield a measurement of FRET due to oligomerization as follows. Eoligo≡kREToligokD+kREToligo(Eq. 3) This could be achieved practically only if the oligomer concentration may be decreased significantly without breaking the oligomers apart. This will require very strong, specific protein-protein interactions because, according to the law of mass action, low surface density will cause oligomers to dissociate. Such strong lateral interactions are known to occur in the case of multisubunit ion channels, some G-protein-coupled receptors, or other stable oligomers (24.Patowary S. Alvarez-Curto E. Xu T.R. Holz J.D. Oliver J.A. Milligan G. Raicu V. The muscarinic M-3 acetylcholine receptor exists as two differently Sized complexes at the plasma membrane.Biochem.

One could also imagine the opposite situation where only the interoligomeric proximity FRET were measured, as in Equation 4. Eprox≡kRETproxkD+kRETprox(Eq. 4) Unfortunately, one cannot experimentally decouple the latter contribution from the former, and it is difficult to know when proximity FRET contribution is negligible, especially if the total surface density of labeled membrane proteins is not known. However, by solving for kREToligo in Equation 3 and for kD in Equation 4 and substituting into Equation 2, one can write down the explicit dependence of Eapp on Eoligo and Eprox, as follows. Eapp=Eprox+Eoligo−2EproxEoligo1−EoligoEprox(Eq. 5) Examination of Equation 5 shows that, if one knows the appropriate proximity FRET contribution, it can be used along with the measured total apparent FRET efficiency to determine the actual FRET due to protein-protein interactions in the membrane. This may be achieved using computer simulations to estimate the interoligomeric proximity FRET (4.King C. Sarabipour S. Byrne P. Leahy D.J. Hristova K. The FRET signatures of non-interacting proteins in membranes: simulations and experiments.Biophys. J. 2014; 106: 1309-1317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Equation 5 can also be rearranged to express the proximity FRET as a function of the total apparent FRET efficiency and the intraoligomeric FRET efficiency. Eprox=Eapp−Eoligo1−2Eoligo+EappEoligo(Eq. 6) Examination of Equations 5 or 6 shows that as Eoligo → 0, Eapp →Eprox, as expected for monomeric proteins. Similarly, as Eprox → 0, Eapp → Eoligo, showing that if the proximity FRET contribution can be minimized by experimental design, the measured apparent FRET is due to protein-protein interactions. Sometimes, the two contributions are summed in the literature (i.e. the total apparent FRET efficiency is assumed to be equal to the sum of the oligomeric FRET of protein-protein interactions and the interoligomeric proximity FRET contribution) (27.Chen L.

Equation 5 shows that this linear relationship is not correct in the general case. However, if one of the contributions is small, a Taylor expansion yields the following. Eapp≈Eoligo+Eprox(Eq. 7) Below, we discuss the cases of constitutive monomers, dimers, and monomers in equilibrium, constitutive dimers, and constitutive tetramers with an intrinsic FRET value of 0.70. The same cases, but with a low intrinsic FRET value of 0.30, as well as the additional cases of constitutive trimers and monomer-tetramer equilibrium, are included in the supplemental Results. Fig. 1 (A–C) shows the total apparent FRET efficiency predictions, Eapp, for the monomer-only simulations. We created two-dimensional configurations of monomeric fluorescent proteins (Fig. 1A), and we simulated Eapp using Equations 8 and 9 (see “Experimental Procedures”). In this case, Eapp is equal to Eprox because there are no interactions, as shown by Equation 5 when Eoligo = 0. Fig. 1B shows the dependence of Eapp on the acceptor fraction, xA, for several different total surface densities of labeled receptors. The dashed lines connect data points with equal total fluorophore concentrations. Eapp is plotted in Fig. 1C as a function of the total concentration for different values of the acceptor fraction, xA. There is a strong dependence on the total concentration and the acceptor fraction, with the highest FRET efficiencies corresponding to the highest acceptor fractions and surface densities. As shown in Fig. 1, high total apparent FRET efficiencies can be recorded for monomeric receptors, especially at high acceptor concentrations. In cases when the association state is unknown, researchers may blindly apply the two oligomerization models, the Veatch and Stryer model (Equation 18) and the thermodynamic model based on the kinetic theory of FRET (see Equation 27), to interpret the monomeric FRET data. The results of such an analysis of monomeric membrane protein FRET with the two models are shown in Fig. 2. In Fig. 2A, the simulated total apparent FRET efficiencies are plotted as a function of the acceptor/donor ratio for three different total concentrations of receptors (rec): 2The abbreviations used are: recreceptorsA/Dacceptor/donorMSEmean squared error. a very low surface density at [T] = 1 × 10−5 rec/nm2, a moderate surface density at [T] = 4 × 10−3 rec/nm2, and a relatively high surface density at [T] = 8 × 10−3 rec/nm2. We generated 500 data points with random acceptor/donor ratios for each total concentration, and Gaussian-distributed random noise was added to the total apparent FRET efficiency data. receptors acceptor/donor mean squared error. We analyzed the data shown in Fig. 2A with the Veatch and Stryer model, where we optimize for Emax and n (see Equation 18). The best fit parameters are given in Table 1, and the three fits are shown as red lines in Fig. 2A. At all but the lowest surface density, the model falsely indicates the presence of dimers. Of note, at the low surface density fitting, the adjustable parameter Emax is equal to zero, due to a lack of any FRET. In any case, the model of Veatch and Stryer does not correctly predict that the proteins are monomeric because the effect of the proximity FRET, the only contribution to FRET in the monomeric case, is not taken into account in the model. Thus, the use of this model to analyze the total apparent FRET efficiency of monomeric membrane proteins will lead to the incorrect conclusion that the measured FRET occurs due to the presence of dimers.TABLE 1Analysis results of the simulations for monomers (order = 1), dimers (order = 2), trimers (order = 3), and tetramers (order = 4) with the models of Veatch and Stryer and the thermodynamic model based on the kinetic theory of FRET for Ẽ = 0.70 Open table in a new tab Next, we again simulated total apparent FRET efficiency arising from monomeric membrane proteins, generating 2,700 data points at random total concentrations, and added Gaussian-distributed random noise to each data point. Fig. 2C shows the simulated total apparent FRET efficiency data as a function of acceptor concentration. We then utilized the kinetic theory formalism to analyze the total apparent FRET efficiency data. The reduced χ2 value was minimized by optimizing for Ẽ and KA for all models from monomer-only through constitutive hexamer formation, n = 1:6 (see Equation 27). For the special case of the monomer-only model, we optimize for the best fit distance of closest approach, L, which is twice the exclusion radius for fluorescent proteins (1.4 nm in this work) (see Equation 20). The best fit reduced χ2 values are plotted as a function of theoretical oligomer order in Fig. 2B, as black crosses for analysis without the interoligomeric proximity FRET consideration and as green crosses for analysis that includes a numerically estimated proximity FRET contribution. Note that the black and green crosses exactly overlap for n = 1 because the same equation (Equation 20) is used in both cases. The overall best fit parameters are given in Table 1. Fitting the total apparent FRET efficiency provides a global minimum for n = 1 when interoligomeric proximity FRET is not considered. The reduced χ2 value for n = 2:6, when proximity FRET is taken into account, is low and is indistinguishable from that found for the case of n = 1 (Fig. 2B, green crosses). However, the best fit thermodynamic parameters for the oligomeric model fitting indicate a practical lack of interactions with an oligomeric fraction at ∼0%. All of the models (n = 1:6) for the data set with added random error pass the reduced χ2 test at 95% confidence, indicating that all models represent the data equally well. Because all models indicate a lack of interactions, we conclude that the analysis based on the kinetic theory of FRET yields the correct conclusion when interoligomeric proximity FRET is taken into account. Without considering a proximity FRET contribution, the reduced χ2 test indicates that the n = 3 model is also an acceptable model, given the data and the associated error. If we do not account for proximity FRET (i.e. if we disregard the analysis for n = 1 and we disregard the green crosses in Fig. 2B), it will appear that the reduced χ2 is minimized at n = 3. Thus, we will reach the incorrect conclusion that we have trimers when in fact we have monomers. Failure to account for interoligomeric FRET will therefore lead to erroneous data int"

This divergent developmental program is sufficient to induce the specification of digit-innervating motor neurons, emphasizing the specialized status of digit control in the evolution of skilled motor behaviors. Our findings suggest that the emergence of digits in the limb is matched by distinct mechanisms for specifying motor neurons that innervate digit muscles. During vertebrate evolution, the creation of limbed appendages provided a critical step in the refinement of skilled motor behaviors (Shubin et al., 1997Shubin N. Tabin C. Carroll S. Fossils, genes and the evolution of animal limbs.Nature. 1997; 388: 639-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Within the limb, the appearance of digits has been argued to represent an essential morphological adaptation that meets the need for dexterous manipulative skills (Sustaita et al., 2013Sustaita D. Pouydebat E. Manzano A. Abdala V. Hertel F. Herrel A. Getting a grip on tetrapod grasping: form, function, and evolution.Biol. Rev. Camb. Philos. Soc. 2013; 88: 380-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The emergence of distal limb elements appears to have been a specialized step in limb patterning, both evolutionarily and molecularly (Nakamura et al., 2016Nakamura T. Gehrke A.R. Lemberg J.

The formation of digits may therefore have demanded the creation of an expanded diversity of motor neuron subtypes able to innervate and coordinate the activity of new digit muscles. Considerable information is available on the logic of innervation of more proximal limb muscles (Dasen and Jessell, 2009Dasen J.S. Jessell T.M. Hox Networks and the Origins of Motor Neuron Diversity. Elsevier, 2009Google Scholar), but how motor neurons destined for digit innervation assume their distinct identities remains unclear. The molecular logic that imposes discrete limb-innervating motor neuron identities involves interactions between conserved signaling molecules and Hox transcriptional codes and is likely to have occurred in a manner aligned with the evolutionary organization of limb pattern. Indeed, the coordination of limb and motor development is achieved in part through the use of common patterning mechanisms. The proximo-distal axis of the limb is specified by a proximal source of retinoic acid and a distal source of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), with signals coordinated through the sequential expression of Hox genes that define the pattern of skeletal elements (Cooper et al., 2011Cooper K.L.

In parallel fashion, rostral retinoic acid and caudal FGFs determine the patterned expression of Hox genes within the neural tube and specify the spatial segregation of motor neuron subtypes that innervate different limb muscle domains (Dasen and Jessell, 2009Dasen J.S. Jessell T.M. Hox Networks and the Origins of Motor Neuron Diversity. Elsevier, 2009Google Scholar, Vanderhorst and Holstege, 1997Vanderhorst V.G. Holstege G.

At brachial and lumbar levels of the spinal cord, Hox6-8 and Hox10-11 paralogs respectively, initiate the programs that specify the lateral motor column (LMC), which innervates limb muscles (Dasen et al., 2003Dasen J.S.

Hoxc10 and Hoxd10 regulate mouse columnar, divisional and motor pool identity of lumbar motoneurons.Development. 2008; 135: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In contrast, Hox9 proteins expressed at thoracic levels mediate the specification of motor neurons projecting to sympathetic chain ganglia and hypaxial muscles (Jung et al., 2010Jung H. Lacombe J. Mazzoni E.O. Liem Jr., K.F. Grinstein J. Mahony S. Mukhopadhyay D. Gifford D.K. Young R.A.

The generation of diverse motor pool subtypes involves the activities of nearly two dozen individual Hox genes, whose expression appears to be defined through cross-repressive interactions (Dasen et al., 2005Dasen J.S.

A Hox regulatory network establishes motor neuron pool identity and target-muscle connectivity.Cell. 2005; 123: 477-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Within the LMC, motor neurons acquire finer divisional and pool transcriptional identities through a coordinated program in which Hox proteins and their conserved cofactor Foxp1 direct the synthesis of retinoic acid in limb-innervating motor neurons (Dasen et al., 2008Dasen J.S.

Consequently, LMC motor neurons have traditionally been defined by co-expression of Foxp1 and the retinoic acid synthesis enzyme Raldh2 (Dasen et al., 2008Dasen J.S. De Camilli A. Wang B. Tucker P.W.

Variation in the expression and function of Hox genes presumably facilitated the adaptation of ancestral motor circuits to evolutionary modifications in limb morphology (Jung and Dasen, 2015Jung H.

We reasoned that if the emergence of limbs necessitated the recruitment of new genetic strategies to pattern limb-innervating motor neurons, then the elaboration of digits over evolution may have required the allocation of divergent molecular programs that specify digit-innervating motor neurons. We have used genetic methods in mouse and chick to explore the specification of digit-innervating motor neurons, initially identifying genes that exhibit selective expression within, or exclusion from, digit-innervating motor neurons. Using these gene markers, we show that digit-innervating motor neurons can be distinguished from other LMC neurons by the expression of a distinct Hox gene repertoire and by their failure to synthesize or respond to retinoic acid. This unusual program of Hox coding and retinoid evasion is sufficient to specify digit-innervating motor neurons, potentially a reflection of the specialized status of digit control in the emergence of skilled limb motor behaviors. To probe molecular distinctions in the specification of motor neurons innervating digit muscles, we performed a screen for genetic markers that distinguish digit-innervating motor neurons from other motor pools. We focused on hindlimb motor pools, comparing motor neurons innervating the intrinsic digit muscles in the foot (IF) with three ankle synergist dorsiflexor muscles, the tibialis anterior (TA), extensor digitorum longus (EDL), and peroneus longus (PL), and one antagonist ankle extensor muscle, the gastrocnemius (GS). We assessed gene expression by performing RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Profiling on cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) labeled motor neurons isolated by laser capture from spinal cord sections of postnatal day 6 (P6) wild-type mice, the earliest age at which selective motor pool labeling could reliably be performed (Figure 1A). Among many genes, comparative pairwise sampling between the five motor pools revealed two general categories of genes, those expressed selectively in intrinsic foot motor neurons and those excluded from them. Although few genes were identified that were expressed selectively in any of the proximal motor pools that were profiled, we identified ten genes that were robustly expressed in intrinsic foot motor neurons, but not other motor pools, with an average difference in gene expression of >25-fold (Figures 1B and S1A). We examined the expression of these genes using in situ hybridization between embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) and P6 in serial spinal cord sections hybridized with a probe against ChAT to reveal the position of motor neurons. Digit muscles are divisible into two groups. Extrinsic digit muscles are located in the forearm or lower leg, control the digits through tendinous attachments, and may also control the wrist or ankle joints. In contrast, intrinsic digit muscles are located within the hand or foot and control solely the digits. We identified intrinsic hand and foot motor neurons based on their dorsal positions at spinal levels C8-T1 and L5, respectively, as determined by retrograde tracing (Figure 2; see also Bácskai et al., 2013Bácskai T. Fu Y. Sengul G. Rusznák Z. Paxinos G. Watson C. Musculotopic organization of the motor neurons supplying forelimb and shoulder girdle muscles in the mouse.Brain Struct.

The ten foot-enriched genes were divisible into four expression classes based on specificity and temporal onset of expression in motor neurons (Figure S1B). One class, represented by Osmr and Col8a1, began expression postnatally, selectively at the position of intrinsic foot motor neurons. A second class, represented by Ecrg4, Reg3b, and Serpinf1, also began expression postnatally, but at the position of both intrinsic hand and foot motor neurons. A third class, represented by S100a11 and Crabp2, was expressed by all LMC motor neurons at embryonic stages but became restricted to the position of intrinsic hand and foot motor neurons from P0 onward. A fourth class, represented by Cpne4, Fign, and Pirt, was selectively expressed from E13.5 onward at the position of intrinsic hand and foot innervating motor neurons (Figures 1C, 1D, and S1B). There was little variation in the number of hand or foot motor neurons labeled by the genes identified from this screen, and each gene appeared to be expressed uniformly throughout the intrinsic hand or foot motor pools. We used immunohistochemistry to examine the selectivity of expression of Cpne4 and Fign, two of the embryonically expressed genes specific to the intrinsic hand and foot motor neurons. Cpne4, a member of the Copine calcium-dependent phospholipid binding protein family, and Fign, a nuclear ATPase, are both associated with diverse intracellular activities, but their role in neurons is unclear. Antibodies selective for mouse Cpne4 and Fign were generated, showed similar patterns of expression to the corresponding in situ hybridization pattern, and were used to examine their motor neuron specificity, in conjunction with retrograde Rh-Dex and CTB tracing in E14.5 and P6 mice (Figures 1C, 2, S1B, S2A, and S2B). As a molecular comparison, we also examined the expression of Scip (Pou3F1), a transcription factor that labels motor neurons that innervate intrinsic muscles in the hand and foot, as well as extrinsic muscles of digit control in the forearm (Dasen et al., 2005Dasen J.S. Tice B.C. Brenner-Morton S. Jessell T.M. A Hox regulatory network establishes motor neuron pool identity and target-muscle connectivity.Cell. 2005; 123: 477-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar; K. Kanning, personal communication). After injection of Rh-Dex into intrinsic hand or foot muscles, we found that all retrogradely labeled motor neurons expressed Scip, Cpne4, and Fign, indicating that these markers label the entire cohort of intrinsic digit-innervating motor neurons (Figure 2). At brachial levels, a more ventral population of Scip+ motor neurons could be labeled by injections into forearm digit-flexor, but not forearm digit-extensor muscles (Figures 2A and S2B). By contrast, Rh-Dex injections into forearm muscles failed to label Cpne4+ or Fign+ motor neurons (Figure S2B). Thus, Cpne4 and Fign expression are selective to intrinsic hand and foot motor neurons, whereas Scip is more broadly expressed—in both extrinsic and intrinsic digit motor pools. The same RNA-seq screen also revealed that the gene Aldh1a2, which encodes the retinoid synthetic enzyme retinaldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (Raldh2), was excluded from intrinsic foot motor neurons but was expressed by other hindlimb pools (Figure 1B). In situ hybridization and retrograde labeling, reported below, showed that Aldh1a2 was excluded from motor neurons at caudal brachial and lumbar levels, the locations at which intrinsic hand and intrinsic foot motor neurons are located, but was expressed by essentially all other LMC motor neurons (Figures 1C and 1D). Taken together, this molecular screen has identified numerous genes expressed in, and one excluded from, digit-innervating motor neurons. Given the relative scarcity of selective markers for motor pools that innervate proximal muscles, the identification of many genes that distinguish digit-innervating motor neurons argues for a fundamental distinction in their specification. Since Aldh1a2 is not expressed by digit-innervating motor neurons, it is possible that the evasion of retinoid signaling is involved in establishing this fundamental motor neuron distinction. We first evaluated the absence of Raldh2 protein expression in intrinsic digit-innervating motor neurons using retrograde tracing. After Rh-Dex and CTB-555 injection into intrinsic hand and intrinsic foot muscles at E14.5 or P0, respectively, none of the retrogradely labeled motor neurons expressed Raldh2 (Figures 3A and S3A). In addition, we found that intrinsic hand and foot motor neurons, as defined by Cpne4 expression, did not express Raldh2 at E11.5, prior to the axonal innervation of distal limb muscles (Figure 3B). In contrast, Raldh2 was detected in all other Foxp1+ LMC motor neurons at rostral brachial and lumbar levels (Figures 3C and 3D). Despite their failure to express Raldh2, intrinsic hand and foot motor neurons expressed Islet1 and Foxp1 at levels comparable to that of other LMC motor neurons (Figures S3B and S3E). We also sought to determine whether motor neurons that innervate extrinsic digit muscles fail to express Raldh2. To resolve this issue, we examined the pattern of Raldh2 expression in Scip+ motor neurons at forelimb levels, which includes forearm digit-flexor and intrinsic digit-innervating motor neurons. All Scip+ motor neurons at E12.5 failed to express Raldh2 (Figure S3D). This result demonstrates that all intrinsic and certain extrinsic digit-innervating motor neurons can be distinguished from other LMC motor neurons throughout embryonic development by the absence of Raldh2 expression. The expression of ETS and other pool-specific transcriptional programs depends on extrinsic signals from the limb mesenchyme (Dasen and Jessell, 2009Dasen J.S. Jessell T.M. Hox Networks and the Origins of Motor Neuron Diversity. Elsevier, 2009Google Scholar). To assess the role of limb-derived cues in digit-motor neuron patterning, we performed unilateral hindlimb ablations in chick embryos. We used Scip and Fign to mark digit-innervating motor neurons in chick, since chick Cpne4 does not display the pool specificity evident in mouse (Figures S3J and S3K). We performed unilateral hindlimb ablation in chick embryos at stage 18, prior to the onset of hind-limb axon innervation. Embryos were permitted to develop until stage 28, prior to the peak period of motor neuron cell death (Calderó et al., 1998Calderó J. Prevette D. Mei X. Oakley R.A. Li L. Milligan C. Houenou L.

Biol. 1985; 109: 193-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Hindlimb ablation did not eliminate Raldh2 expression at spinal level L3, nor was Raldh2 expression induced ectopically at caudal lumbar levels (Figure S3L). Moreover, hindlimb ablation did not disrupt the generation of Scip+ and Fign+ intrinsic foot motor neurons (Figure 3H). Thus, the generation of digit-innervating motor neurons and their failure to express Raldh2 occurs independently of limb-derived cues. We also sought to address the potential contribution of other signaling pathways to digit-motor neuron specification. BMPs regulate limb and spinal patterning, through phosphorylation of SMAD1, SMAD5 and SMAD8, and BMP2, BMP4 and BMP7 are expressed in the apical ectodermal ridge of the developing autopod (Liu and Niswander, 2005Liu A. Niswander L.A. Bone morphogenetic protein signalling and vertebrate nervous system development.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, Robert, 2007Robert B. Bone morphogenetic protein signaling in limb outgrowth and patterning.Dev. Growth Differ. 2007; 49: 455-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We therefore considered the possibility that the BMP-pSMAD pathway contributes to the development of digit-innervating motor neurons. To assess whether digit-innervating motor neurons engage in pSMAD signaling, we injected Dex-biotin into intrinsic hand or intrinsic foot muscles at E14.5 and observed that nearly all labeled digit-innervating motor neurons expressed pSMAD (Figure 3F). Intrinsic hand and foot motor neurons first expressed pSMAD at E12.5 and E13.5, respectively, with the number of pSMAD-labeled motor neurons increasing from E12.5–E14.5 (Figures 3G and S3I). In contrast, Scip+ forearm digit-flexor motor neurons did not express pSMAD, indicating that pSMAD is expressed selectively by intrinsic digit-innervating motor neurons (Figure S3I). The timing of pSMAD expression is consistent with the timing of limb axon innervation, suggesting selective induction in intrinsic digit-innervating motor neurons upon the arrival of their axons in the developing autopod. Intrinsic digit-innervating motor neurons also express pSMAD in chick (Figure S3K). To determine whether the induction of pSMAD in intrinsic digit-innervating motor neurons depends on signals from the limb mesenchyme, we examined chick embryos in which the right hindlimb had been ablated. We found that hindlimb ablation disrupted the expression of pSMAD in Scip+ and Fign+ intrinsic foot motor neurons (Figure 3H). Taken together, these findings argue that pSMAD signaling is induced in intrinsic digit motor neurons by limb-derived cues, occurs after the initial specification of these motor neurons, but is not involved in the exclusion of Aldh1a2. We next sought to address whether retinoid signaling influences the generation of digit-innervating motor neurons. If the specification of digit-innervating motor neurons requires the absence of retinoid signaling, constitutive retinoid induction might be expected to disrupt their development. We activated retinoic acid receptor signaling in digit-innervating and other motor neurons by chick neural tube electroporation of a constitutively active retinoic acid receptor, VP16RAR-GFP, in which the retinoic acid receptor RARα is fused to the transcriptional activator VP16 (Novitch et al., 2003Novitch B.G.

This constitutively activated RAR receptor mediates transcription at retinoic acid response elements (RAREs) (Figure S4A), through heterodimer formation with RXR receptors, which are widely expressed in the spinal cord (data not shown). Electroporations were performed using a pCAGGS driver at brachial levels at stages 14–16, prior to the acquisition of motor neuron divisional or pool identity. Although chickens have undergone evolutionary digit loss at forelimb levels, with wings containing three rather than five digits, wing digit muscles are still innervated by motor neurons (Hollyday and Jacobson, 1990Hollyday M. Jacobson R.D. Location of motor pools innervating chick wing.J. Comp. Neurol. 1990; 302: 575-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, Straznicky and Tay, 1983Straznicky C. Tay D. The localization of motoneuron pools innervating wing muscles in the chick.Anat. Embryol. (Berl.). 1983; 166: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We first examined whether expression of a constitutively active retinoid receptor perturbs the development of LMC neurons. Electroporation of VP16RAR-GFP or a control GFP construct did not change the number of Foxp1+ motor neurons at spinal level C6-C7 (Figures 4B and 4C ), an indication that constitutive retinoid induction does not have a general impact on motor neuron number. In contrast, electroporation of a dominant negative retinoic acid receptor, RAR403, was lethal to developing motor neuron progenitors (data not shown). In addition, motor neurons electroporated with VP16RAR-GFP or a control GFP construct maintained consistent levels of Foxp1 expression, indicating that retinoid induction does not disrupt induction of Foxp1 expression (Figure S4J). In contrast, electroporation of VP16RAR-GFP selectively reduced the average number of Foxp1+ motor neurons at C8-T1 by 30%, despite a similar fraction of Foxp1+ motor neurons expressing either VP16RAR-GFP or control GFP construct (Figures 4D and 4E; p < 0.001, Figure S4I). The moderate loss of Foxp1+ neurons is consistent with the observation that only ∼50% of motor neurons at C8-T1 innervate digit muscles (Figures 4E, 4G, and S4H). These findings reveal that retinoid induction maintains Foxp1 expression but results in a selective loss of Foxp1+ motor neurons at segmental levels at which digit-innervating motor neurons are located. Retinoic acid plays an early role in directing divisional identity within the LMC (Ji et al., 2006Ji S.-J. Zhuang B. Falco C. Schneider A. Schuster-Gossler K. Gossler A. Sockanathan S. Mesodermal and neuronal retinoids regulate the induction and maintenance of limb innervating spinal motor neurons.Dev.

Retinoid receptor signaling in postmitotic motor neurons regulates rostrocaudal positional identity and axonal projection pattern.Neuron. 2003; 40: 97-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), prompting us to examine the effect of retinoid induction on medial-lateral divisional specification within the LMC. We used the medial LMC marker Isl1, since the lateral LMC marker Lim1 is not expressed at late embryonic stages. We found that electroporation of VP16RAR-GFP at brachial levels reduced the average number of Isl1+ motor neurons by 22% (Figures S4C and S4D; p < 0.001). Similarly, VP16RAR-GFP electroporation reduced the average number of medial Pea3+ motor neurons by 28% (Figures S4E and S4F; p < 0.001). The maintenance of the overall number of Foxp1+ motor neurons at C6-C7 argues that retinoid induction induces only a modest medial-to-lateral shift in LMC divisional specification. We next examined the effect of retinoid induction on the expression of digit-innervating motor neuron markers at brachial levels. We found that electroporation of VP16RAR-GFP at brachial levels reduced the average number of Scip+ and Fign+ motor neurons by 64% and 69%, respectively (Figures 4F, 4G, S4G, and S4H; p < 0.001). Given the proportion of motor neurons that innervate digits at C8-T1, the observed reduction of digit-motor neuron marker expression is consistent with the observed 30% reduction in Foxp1+ neurons at these segmental levels. Thus, it is unlikely that the digit-innervating motor neurons were redirected to other LMC pool identities. Moreover, of the Scip+ and Fign+ motor neurons that remained after electroporation, the percentage expressing VP16RAR-GFP was reduced by 36% and 39%, respectively, as compared to those expressing GFP control (Figures S4I and S4K). Taken together with the reduction of Foxp1+ at caudal brachial levels, these results provide evidence, indicated by selective marker expression, that retinoid induction results in a selective loss of motor neurons fated to innervate digits. LMC neurons acquire distinct pool subtype identities through the actions of Hox transcription factors, which also regulate the expression of Raldh2 (Dasen et al., 2005Dasen J.S. Tice B.C. Br"
https://openalex.org/W2587727824,"In primates, posterior auditory cortical areas are thought to be part of a dorsal auditory pathway that processes spatial information. But how posterior (and other) auditory areas represent acoustic space remains a matter of debate. Here we provide new evidence based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the macaque indicating that space is predominantly represented by a distributed hemifield code rather than by a local spatial topography. Hemifield tuning in cortical and subcortical regions emerges from an opponent hemispheric pattern of activation and deactivation that depends on the availability of interaural delay cues. Importantly, these opponent signals allow responses in posterior regions to segregate space similarly to a hemifield code representation. Taken together, our results reconcile seemingly contradictory views by showing that the representation of space follows closely a hemifield code and suggest that enhanced posterior-dorsal spatial specificity in primates might emerge from this form of coding."
https://openalex.org/W2588435922,"Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) catalyze protein arginine methylation and are linked to carcinogenesis and metastasis. Some members of PRMTs have been found to undergo automethylation; however, the biologic significance of this self-modification is not entirely clear. In this report, we demonstrate that R531 of PRMT7 is self-methylated, both in vitro and in vivo. Automethylation of PRMT7 plays a key role in inducing the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) program and in promoting the migratory and invasive behavior of breast cancer cells. We also prove in a nude mouse model that expression of wild-type PRMT7 in MCF7 breast cancer cells promotes metastasis in vivo, in contrast to the PRMT7 R531K mutant (a mimic of the unmethylated status). Moreover, our immunohistochemical data unravel a close link between PRMT7 automethylation and the clinical outcome of breast carcinomas. Mechanistically, we determine that loss of PRMT7 automethylation leads to the reduction of its recruitment to the E-cadherin promoter by YY1, which consequently derepresses the E-cadherin expression through decreasing the H4R3me2s level. The findings in this work define a novel post-translational modification of PRMT7 that has a promoting impact on breast cancer metastasis.—Geng, P., Zhang, Y., Liu, X., Zhang, N., Liu, Y., Liu, X., Lin, C., Yan, X., Li, Z., Wang, G., Li, Y., Tan, J., Liu, D.-X., Huang, B., Lu, J.

https://openalex.org/W2974136667,"Myelination is controlled by timely expression of genes involved in the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) into myelinating oligodendrocytes (OLs). Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2), a NAD+-dependent deacetylase, plays a critical role in OL differentiation by promoting both arborization and downstream expression of myelin-specific genes. However, the mechanisms involved in regulating SIRT2 expression during OL development are largely unknown. The RNA-binding protein quaking (QKI) plays an important role in myelination by post-transcriptionally regulating the expression of several myelin specific genes. In quaking viable (qkv/qkv) mutant mice, SIRT2 protein is severely reduced; however, it is not known whether these genes interact to regulate OL differentiation. Here, we report for the first time that QKI directly binds to Sirt2 mRNA via a common quaking response element (QRE) located in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) to control SIRT2 expression in OL lineage cells. This interaction is associated with increased stability and longer half-lives of Sirt2.1 and Sirt2.2 transcripts leading to increased accumulation of Sirt2 transcripts. Consistent with this, overexpression of qkI promoted the expression of Sirt2 mRNA and protein. However, overexpression of the nuclear isoform qkI-5 promoted the expression of Sirt2 mRNA, but not SIRT2 protein, and delayed OL differentiation. These results suggest that the balance in the subcellular distribution and temporal expression of QKI isoforms control the availability of Sirt2 mRNA for translation. Collectively, our study demonstrates that QKI directly plays a crucial role in the post-transcriptional regulation and expression of Sirt2 to facilitate OL differentiation.

In Plp mutants, the loss of SIRT2 is observed primarily in the myelin sheath (25.Zhu H. Zhao L. Wang E. Dimova N. Liu G. Feng Y. Cambi F.

The QKI-PLP pathway controls SIRT2 abundance in CNS myelin.Glia. 2012; 60: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Moreover, no putative QREs have previously been identified in Sirt2 mRNA. Thus, it was postulated that QKI indirectly regulates SIRT2 expression during CNS myelination through co-transport with PLP into the myelin sheath (25.Zhu H. Zhao L. Wang E. Dimova N. Liu G. Feng Y. Cambi F. The QKI-PLP pathway controls SIRT2 abundance in CNS myelin.Glia. 2012; 60: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To further investigate the relationship between qkI and Sirt2 in OL development, we used mouse primary OLs and the CG4-OL cell line derived from neonatal rat forebrain O-2A progenitors that undergo defined stages of differentiation under controlled media conditions (31.Ji S.

Thus, we sought to delineate the molecular mechanisms that govern the direct or indirect interaction between the RNA-binding protein QKI and Sirt2 during OL development. We demonstrate a direct interaction between QKI and Sirt2 mRNA in OL progenitors and differentiating OLs. The binding site for QKI was mapped to the QRE ACUAAC at 1853–1858 bp in the 3′ UTR of Sirt2 mRNA. Our findings indicate that Sirt2 is a direct target of QKI. Binding of QKI increases the post-transcriptional stability of Sirt2 mRNA and controls its availability for translation. Furthermore, our results show QKI-5 delays the transition from OPC through to post-mitotic, immature OL resulting in a delay in differentiation. The subcellular localization and coordinated temporal expression of specific QKI isoforms appear to govern Sirt2 expression for proper OL differentiation. QKI plays a critical role in OL differentiation by regulating the expression of several myelin specific genes, such as Mbp (6.Larocque D. Pilotte J. Chen T. Cloutier F. Massie B. Pedraza L.

We have previously demonstrated that SIRT2 can promote OL differentiation (31.Ji S. Doucette J.R. Nazarali A.J. Sirt2 is a novel in vivo downstream target of Nkx2.2 and enhances oligodendroglial cell differentiation.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2011; 3: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Hence, we sought to delineate the molecular interaction between qkI and Sirt2. In CG4-OL cells, the expression pattern of both qkI (Fig. 1) and Sirt2 (Fig. 2) increased over 6 days of differentiation. Detailed quantitative mRNA and protein analyzes revealed differential expression of specific isoforms of QKI and SIRT2 during OL differentiation in vitro. Expression of qkI mRNA (Fig. 1A) gradually increased with differentiation reaching a ∼3-fold increase by day 6. There was a corresponding increase in expression of the QKI protein product QKI-6 isoform (∼2-fold increase at day 6 in differentiation medium (DM)) but not of QKI-5 or QKI-7, which co-migrate on the immunoblot (Fig. 1, B and C).FIGURE 2Expression of Sirt2 mRNA and protein increases during differentiation. CG4-OL progenitor cells in GM were transferred to DM and whole cell lysates were collected at 24-h intervals (days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6). A, Sirt2 mRNA expression increases under differentiation conditions. Sirt2.2 mRNA is the most abundant transcript expressed in CG4-OL cells and increases by day 1 of differentiation. qRT-PCR data (n = 3 biological replicates) were normalized to β-actin and represented relative to Sirt2.3 variant at day 0 (mean ± S.E.; two-way ANOVA). ‡ denotes Sirt2.1 mRNA with p < 0.001; α denotes Sirt2.2 mRNA with p < 0.001; † denotes Sirt2.3 mRNA with p < 0.001 relative to their respective variants at day 0. B, representative immunoblot showing a corresponding increase in SIRT2 protein expression over the course of differentiation. C, densitometric analysis of immunoblots (n = 3 biological replicates) reveal that SIRT2.2 is the predominate isoform expressed during OL differentiation. Data were normalized to β-tubulin and represented relative to the respective isoform at day 0 (mean ± S.E.; two-way ANOVA, ***, p < 0.001).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Sirt2.2 variant was the most abundant transcript in CG4-OL cells with ∼4.5-fold and ∼2700-fold greater expression than Sirt2.1 and Sirt2.3, respectively, under growth conditions (Fig. 2A). Expression of the Sirt2.2 transcript increased ∼8-fold within 24 h under differentiation conditions and was maintained through to day 6. Similarly, Sirt2.1 and Sirt2.3 mRNA expression increased throughout differentiation. SIRT2.2 was also the most abundant protein isoform in CG4-OL cells (Fig. 2B). Expression of SIRT2.2 protein increased ∼2.5-fold by day 3 and was maintained through to day 6 (Fig. 2C). Although Sirt2.1 and Sirt2.3 mRNA increased during differentiation, this did not translate to an increase in the SIRT2.1 or SIRT2.3 protein products. The extent of differentiation was analyzed by quantifying the expression of mature OL marker MBP. Expression of Mbp mRNA (supplemental Fig. S1A) increased during differentiation reaching a ∼60-fold increase by day 6. Consistent with this, expression of MBP protein (supplemental Fig. S1B) also increased with differentiation. The coordinated expression patterns of qkI and Sirt2 during OL differentiation suggests that these two genes may interact, either directly or indirectly, to promote OL differentiation. Quaking viable mutant mice (qkv/qkv) exhibit reduced SIRT2 protein expression in myelin sheath (25.Zhu H. Zhao L. Wang E. Dimova N. Liu G. Feng Y. Cambi F. The QKI-PLP pathway controls SIRT2 abundance in CNS myelin.Glia. 2012; 60: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), yet there is little known about the relationship between QKI and Sirt2 mRNA during CNS myelination. To investigate what role QKI may have in regulating the expression of Sirt2 during OL differentiation, qkI was overexpressed in CG4-OL cells by transfection with the common coding sequence of the RNA binding domain from QKI-5, QKI-6, and QKI-7. Up-regulation of qkI resulted in an increase in Sirt2 mRNA expression under both proliferating (growth media; GM) (Fig. 3A) and differentiating (DM, day 6) conditions (Fig. 3B). In GM, overexpression of qkI in proliferating CG4-OLs increased Sirt2.1 and Sirt2.2 mRNA levels to ∼2- and ∼3-fold, respectively; in contrast, Sirt2.3 expression was not affected (Fig. 3A). In DM, expression of all three variants increased ∼2-fold in differentiating CG4-OLs (Fig. 3B). Up-regulation of qkI also resulted in a corresponding increase in SIRT2.1 and SIRT2.2 protein expression under both proliferating (Fig. 3, C and D) and differentiating (Fig. 3, E and F) conditions in CG4-OLs. Furthermore, to examine the regulatory function of QKI in OLs, qkI was overexpressed in primary OLs isolated from the mouse brain (35.Chen Y. Balasubramaniyan V. Peng J. Hurlock E.C. Tallquist M.

The fourth complement component, C4, and the second component, C2, are indispensable constituents of the C3 convertase complex, C4bC2a, which is formed by both the CP and the LP. Whereas in the absence of C4, CP can no longer activate C3, LP retains a residual but physiologically critical capacity to convert native C3 into its activation fragments, C3a and C3b. This residual C4 and/or C2 bypass route is dependent on LP-specific mannan-binding lectin-associated serine protease-2. By using various serum sources with defined complement deficiencies, we demonstrate that, under physiologic conditions LP-specific C4 and/or C2 bypass activation of C3 is mediated by direct cleavage of native C3 by mannan-binding lectin-associated serine protease-2 bound to LP-activation complexes captured on ligand-coated surfaces.—Yaseen, S., Demopulos, G., Dudler, T., Yabuki, M., Wood, C.

In this study, we investigated whether H2S exerts antioxidant effects in kidney proximal tubular epithelial cells in a high-glucose environment and whether this effect involves regulation of NOX4 expression. We also explored whether H2S recruits the NO pathway in the regulation of NOX4. cystathionine γ-lyase reactive oxygen species NADPH oxidase mouse kidney cortical proximal tubular epithelial cell acetyl-CoA carboxylase inducible NOS endothelial NOS neuronal NOS analysis of variance N(ω)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester actinomycin D AMP-activated kinase dichlorodihydrofluorescein chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate. Because NOX4 is constitutively active, the amount of ROS released by the enzyme is regulated by control of its protein expression (11Gorin Y. Block K.

Nox as a target for diabetic complications.Clin. Sci. 2013; 125: 361-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). High glucose increased NOX4 expression in mouse kidney proximal tubular epithelial (MCT) cells at 24 h (Fig. 1A). Sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), a source of H2S, dose-dependently inhibited high glucose-induced NOX4 expression, restoring basal expression at 250 μm (Fig. 1B); we employed this concentration in our experiments. Equimolar mannitol did not regulate NOX4 expression (data not shown), excluding non-osmotic mechanisms. High glucose increased NOX4 mRNA content preceding the increase in protein (Fig. 1C); it was abrogated by NaHS (Fig. 1D). High glucose-induced NOX4 protein expression could be inhibited by actinomycin D, a transcription blocker (Fig. 1E). An NADPH oxidase assay employing lucigenin chemiluminescence showed that NaHS inhibited high glucose-induced NOX4 activation (Fig. 1F). Together, these data show that augmented transcription is involved in the high glucose-induced increase in NOX4 expression and that H2S inhibited high glucose-induced changes in NOX4 expression and activity. H2S activates AMPK to inhibit high-glucose stimulation of protein synthesis in kidney glomerular epithelial cells (4Lee H.J. Mariappan M.M. Feliers D. Cavaglieri R.C. Sataranatarajan K. Abboud H.E. Choudhury G.G. Kasinath B.S. Hydrogen sulfide inhibits high glucose-induced matrix protein synthesis by activating AMP-activated protein kinase in renal epithelial cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 4451-4461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we examined whether AMPK mediated the H2S inhibition of high glucose-induced NOX4 synthesis. NaHS time-dependently increased AMPK phosphorylation on Thr-172 of the α subunit, with onset at 5 min and return to baseline at 30 min (Fig. 2A), in line with our past observation (4Lee H.J. Mariappan M.M. Feliers D. Cavaglieri R.C. Sataranatarajan K. Abboud H.E. Choudhury G.G. Kasinath B.S.

Chem. 2012; 287: 4451-4461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). High glucose, but not equimolar mannitol, reduced AMPK phosphorylation, which was restored by NaHS (Fig. 2B). To confirm that the increase in Thr-172 phosphorylation of AMPK corresponds to the increase in AMPK activity, we examined the status of Ser-79 phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), a direct substrate of AMPK. NaHS time-dependently stimulated ACC phosphorylation; high glucose could not inhibit ACC phosphorylation in the presence of NaHS (Fig. 2, C and D). Preincubation of cells with compound C, a selective AMPK inhibitor, abolished NaHS inhibition of the high glucose-induced increase in NOX4 expression (Fig. 2E). These data show that AMPK activation is required for the inhibitory effect of H2S on high glucose-induced NOX4 expression. Compound C also increased the basal NOX4 content, suggesting that AMPK constitutively inhibits the expression of that protein. There are similarities in some of the biological effects of NO and H2S (23Coletta C. Papapetropoulos A. Erdelyi K. Olah G. Módis K. Panopoulos P. Asimakopoulou A. Gerö D. Sharina I. Martin E. Szabo C. Hydrogen sulfide and nitric oxide are mutually dependent in the regulation of angiogenesis and endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

U.S.A. 2012; 109: 8801-8802Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We examined whether the H2S effect on high glucose-induced NOX4 expression involves NO. NaHS inhibition of high glucose-induced NOX4 expression was abolished by N(ω)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME), a general NOS inhibitor (Fig. 3A), suggesting a role for NO in mediating the H2S effect. l-NAME augmented basal NOX4 expression in control 5 mm glucose-treated cells, suggesting that NO exerts a tonal inhibition on NOX4 in the basal state. Next, we explored the type of NOS involved in NO generation. Ser-1177 phosphorylation is required for endothelial NOS (eNOS) activation. NaHS inhibited eNOS phosphorylation for up to 8 h and did not regulate its protein expression (Fig. 3B). MCT cells did not express neuronal NOS (nNOS) (Fig. 3C). These data excluded a role of eNOS or nNOS in mediating the effect of H2S. NaHS augmented the expression of iNOS in a time-dependent manner, peaking at 4 h (Fig. 3D). NaHS increased mRNA expression of iNOS at 2 h (Fig. 3E), and the NaHS-induced iNOS protein expression at 4 h could be blocked by actinomycin D (Fig. 3F). These data indicate that the mechanism of increase in iNOS expression by H2S involves stimulation of its transcription. Additionally, compound C blocked the NaHS-induced increase in iNOS protein (Fig. 3G), showing that AMPK mediated the increase. We tested the requirement of iNOS to mediate NaHS inhibition of the high glucose-induced NOX4 increase. Expression of si-iNOS abrogated the inhibitory effect of NaHS on the high glucose-induced increase in NOX4 (Fig. 3H). Together, these data demonstrate that H2S stimulates iNOS expression in an AMPK-dependent manner to inhibit the high glucose-induced increase in NOX4. NOX4 is a major source of ROS produced by the kidney cells on exposure to high glucose (11Gorin Y. Block K. Nox4 and diabetic nephropathy: with a friend like this, who needs enemies?.Free Radic.

Sci. 2013; 125: 361-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We examined whether NO generated by iNOS was involved in H2S inhibition of high glucose-induced ROS generation. DCF fluorescence revealed that high glucose promoted intracellular ROS generation at 24 h (Fig. 4B), which was abolished by NaHS (Fig. 4D). Both l-NAME, a general NOS inhibitor, and 1400W, a selective inhibitor of iNOS, abrogated NaHS inhibition of the high glucose-induced ROS increase (Fig. 4, F and H). These data show that H2S inhibition of high glucose-induced ROS generation requires iNOS activity. Because AMPK phosphorylation was required for NaHS inhibition of high glucose-induced NOX4 expression at 24 h (Fig. 2E) and because an iNOS increase was seen at 4 h following NaHS exposure (Fig. 3D), we tested whether NO generated by iNOS stimulates AMPK phosphorylation, which, in turn, regulates NOX4. NONOate, an NO donor, promptly stimulated AMPK phosphorylation (Fig. 5A). NaHS also stimulated AMPK phosphorylation, which was seen at 8 h, corresponding to the time iNOS would be active (Fig. 5B). Together with the rapid increase in AMPK phosphorylation induced by NaHS, as shown in Fig. 2A, these observations suggest a biphasic regulation where the rapid induction of AMPK phosphorylation (Fig. 2A) may be a direct effect of NaHS, whereas the increase at 8 h is probably mediated by NO generated by iNOS (Fig. 5B). We tested the latter scenario. The expression of si-iNOS abolished AMPK phosphorylation at 8 h (Fig. 5C). We also tested whether NO can mediate NaHS inhibition of high glucose-induced NOX4. NONOate, the NO donor, inhibited high glucose-induced NOX4 expression at 24 h (Fig. 5D). The inhibitory effect of NONOate on high glucose-induced NOX4 was blocked by compound C (Fig. 5E), indicating that it was AMPK-dependent. These data show that NaHS promotes iNOS expression (Fig. 3D) and NO generation, leading to AMPK activation (Fig. 5A) and inhibition of high glucose-induced NOX4 expression (Fig. 2E). Accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins is a hallmark of kidney injury in diabetes; it manifests as thickening of the glomerular and tubular basement membranes, glomerulosclerosis, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis and, importantly, contributes to the loss of kidney function (25Kasinath B.S. Lee M.J. Feliers D. Sonenberg N. Cortes P.M. Mogensen C.E. Contemporary Diabetes: The Diabetic Kidney. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2003: 97-116Google Scholar). Because we employed renal proximal tubular epithelial cells in our study, we examined the status of laminin γ1, an important component of the tubular basement membrane (26Ha T.S. Barnes J.L. Stewart J.L. Ko C.W. Miner J.H. Abrahamson D.R. Sanes J.R. Kasinath B.S. Regulation of renal laminin in mice with type II diabetes.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 1931-1939Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). High glucose, but not equimolar mannitol, increased laminin γ1 expression in MCT cells, which was abolished by NaHS (Fig. 6A), confirming our previous report (4Lee H.J. Mariappan M.M. Feliers D. Cavaglieri R.C. Sataranatarajan K. Abboud H.E. Choudhury G.G. Kasinath B.S.

Chem. 2012; 287: 4451-4461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We evaluated the requirement of NOX4 to mediate the high glucose-induced increase in laminin γ1. Reduction in NOX4 expression by siRNA abolished the high glucose-induced increase in laminin γ1 expression (Fig. 6B). These data collectively show that high glucose stimulation of matrix protein requires NOX4 and that H2S inhibition of this process is mediated by inhibiting NOX4. We investigated whether H2S amelioration of the high glucose-induced matrix laminin γ1 increase involved iNOS activation. Preincubation with l-NAME, a general NOS inhibitor, or 1400W, a selective iNOS inhibitor, abolished NaHS inhibition of the high glucose-induced increase in laminin γ1 (Fig. 7, A and B). The role of iNOS was directly confirmed by employing siRNA; reduction in iNOS expression by siRNA abrogated NaHS inhibition of the high glucose-induced increase in laminin γ1 expression (Fig. 7C). That NO was involved in NaHS amelioration of the high glucose-induced increase in laminin γ1 in an AMPK-dependent manner was confirmed by directly employing NONOate, the NO donor, and compound C, the AMPK inhibitor (Fig. 7, D and E). Together, these observations lead to the conclusion that H2S inhibition of high-glucose stimulation of laminin γ1 is mediated by NO generation by iNOS in MCT cells. Our data show that H2S inhibits high glucose-induced NOX4 expression, subsequent ROS generation, and matrix protein laminin increase in MCT cells by harnessing iNOS activation. The serial events are as follows: H2S stimulates an increase in iNOS expression (Fig. 3D), and the increased iNOS expression and NO generation mediate H2S inhibition of high glucose-induced NOX4 expression (Fig. 3H), ROS generation (Fig. 4H), and increased matrix laminin content (Fig. 7C). AMPK activity is required for both H2S-stimulated iNOS expression (Fig. 3G) and NO inhibition of high glucose-induced NOX4 expression (Fig. 5E). These data show that H2S serves as an antioxidant in high glucose-treated kidney epithelial cells by recruiting NO to inhibit NOX4, ROS generation, and matrix protein increase (Fig. 8). Previous studies have shown that H2S restrains oxidative stress by a variety of mechanisms, including inhibition of mitochondrial ROS production, augmenting GSH production, and scavenging ROS (5Suzuki K.

https://openalex.org/W2501971320,"The onset of schizophrenia is typically preceded by a prodromal period lasting several years during which sub-threshold symptoms may be identified retrospectively. Clinical interviews are currently used to identify individuals who have an ultra-high risk (UHR) of developing a psychotic illness with a view to provision of interventions that prevent, delay or reduce severity of future mental health issues. The utility of bio-markers as an adjunct in the identification of UHR individuals is not yet established. Several event-related potential measures, especially mismatch-negativity (MMN), have been identified as potential biomarkers for schizophrenia. In this 12-month longitudinal study, demographic, clinical and neuropsychological data were acquired from 102 anti-psychotic naive UHR and 61 healthy controls, of whom 80 UHR and 58 controls provided valid EEG data during a passive auditory task at baseline. Despite widespread differences between UHR and controls on demographic, clinical and neuropsychological measures, MMN and P3a did not differ between these groups. Of 67 UHR at the 12-month follow-up, 7 (10%) had transitioned to a psychotic illness. The statistical power to detect differences between those who did or did not transition was limited by the lower than expected transition rate. ERPs did not predict transition, with trends in the opposite direction to that predicted. In exploratory analysis, the strongest predictors of transition were measures of verbal memory and subjective emotional disturbance."

We do so by constructing extensive yet improvable tables of food and activity related phrases, and respectively assigning them with sourced estimates of caloric intake and expenditure. We show that for Twitter, our naive measures of ""caloric input"", ""caloric output"", and the ratio of these measures are all strong correlates with health and well-being measures for the contiguous United States. Our caloric balance measure in many cases outperforms both its constituent quantities; is tunable to specific health and well-being measures such as diabetes rates; has the capability of providing a real-time signal reflecting a population's health; and has the potential to be used alongside traditional survey data in the development of public policy and collective self-awareness. Because our Lexicocalorimeter is a linear superposition of principled phrase scores, we also show we can move beyond correlations to explore what people talk about in collective detail, and assist in the understanding and explanation of how population-scale conditions vary, a capacity unavailable to black-box type methods."

Here we investigated the mechanism by which glucagon and insulin increased FGF21 gene transcription in primary hepatocyte cultures.

Glucagon plus insulin stimulated a 5-fold increase in ATF4 protein abundance, and knockdown of ATF4 expression suppressed the ability of glucagon plus insulin to increase FGF21 expression. In hepatocytes incubated in the presence of insulin, treatment with a PKA-selective agonist mimicked the ability of glucagon to stimulate ATF4 and FGF21 expression. Inhibition of PKA, PI3K, Akt, and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) suppressed the ability of glucagon plus insulin to stimulate ATF4 and FGF21 expression.

Recent studies have reported that additional transcription factors, including nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6), are also activated by cytosolic DNA, suggesting that cytosolic DNA-induced gene expression is orchestrated by multiple factors.

Additionally, we observed a novel cytosolic DNA-induced phosphorylation at serine 754 in the transactivation domain of STAT3. Upon cytosolic DNA stimulation, Ser754 is directly phosphorylated by TBK1 in a STING-dependent manner. Moreover, Ser754 phosphorylation inhibits cytosolic DNA-induced STAT3 transcriptional activity and selectively reduces STAT3 target genes that are up-regulated in response to cytosolic DNA.

https://openalex.org/W2589010465,"Jmjd3 and Utx are demethylases specific for lysine 27 of histone H3. Previous reports indicate that Jmjd3 is essential for differentiation of various cell types, such as macrophages and epidermal cells in mice, whereas Utx is involved in cancer and developmental diseases in humans and mice, as well as Hox regulation in zebrafish and nematodes. Here, we report that Jmjd3, but not Utx, is involved in axial skeletal formation in mice. A Jmjd3 mutant embryo (Jmjd3Δ18/Δ18), but not a catalytically inactive Utx truncation mutant (Utx−/y), showed anterior homeotic transformation. Quantitative RT-PCR and microarray analyses showed reduced Hox expression in both Jmjd3Δ18/Δ18 embryos and tailbuds, whereas levels of Hox activators, such as Wnt signaling factors and retinoic acid synthases, did not decrease, which suggests that Jmjd3 plays a regulatory role in Hox expression during axial patterning. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses of embryo tailbud tissue showed trimethylated lysine 27 on histone H3 to be at higher levels at the Hox loci in Jmjd3Δ18/Δ18 mutants compared with wild-type tailbuds. In contrast, trimethylated lysine 4 on histone H3 levels were found to be equivalent in wild-type and Jmjd3Δ18/Δ18 tailbuds. Demethylase-inactive Jmjd3 mutant embryos showed the same phenotype as Jmjd3Δ18/Δ18 mice. These results suggest that the demethylase activity of Jmjd3, but not that of Utx, affects mouse axial patterning in concert with alterations in Hox gene expression.—Naruse, C., Shibata, S., Tamura, M., Kawaguchi, T., Abe, K., Sugihara, K., Kato, T., Nishiuchi, T., Wakana, S., Ikawa, M., Asano, M.

In humans, complete CYP27A1 deficiency leads to cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis or nodule formation in tendons and brain (preferentially in the cerebellum) rich in cholesterol and cholestanol, the 5α-saturated analog of cholesterol. In Cyp27a1−/− mice, xanthomas are not formed, despite a significant cholestanol increase in the brain and cerebellum. The mechanism behind cholestanol production has been clarified, yet little is known about its metabolism, except that CYP27A1 might metabolize cholestanol. It also is unclear why CYP27A1 deficiency results in preferential cholestanol accumulation in the cerebellum. We hypothesized that cholestanol might be metabolized by CYP46A1, the principal cholesterol 24-hydroxylase in the brain. We quantified sterols along with CYP27A1 and CYP46A1 in mouse models (Cyp27a1−/−, Cyp46a1−/−, Cyp27a1−/−Cyp46a1−/−, and two wild type strains) and human brain specimens. In vitro experiments with purified P450s were conducted as well. We demonstrate that CYP46A1 is involved in cholestanol removal from the brain and that several factors contribute to the preferential increase in cholestanol in the cerebellum arising from CYP27A1 deficiency. These factors include (i) low cerebellar abundance of CYP46A1 and high cerebellar abundance of CYP27A1, the lack of which probably selectively increases the cerebellar cholestanol production; (ii) spatial separation in the cerebellum of cholesterol/cholestanol-metabolizing P450s from a pool of metabolically available cholestanol; and (iii) weak cerebellar regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis.

We hypothesized that cholestanol might be metabolized by CYP46A1, the principal cholesterol 24-hydroxylase in the brain. We quantified sterols along with CYP27A1 and CYP46A1 in mouse models (Cyp27a1−/−, Cyp46a1−/−, Cyp27a1−/−Cyp46a1−/−, and two wild type strains) and human brain specimens. In vitro experiments with purified P450s were conducted as well. We demonstrate that CYP46A1 is involved in cholestanol removal from the brain and that several factors contribute to the preferential increase in cholestanol in the cerebellum arising from CYP27A1 deficiency. These factors include (i) low cerebellar abundance of CYP46A1 and high cerebellar abundance of CYP27A1, the lack of which probably selectively increases the cerebellar cholestanol production; (ii) spatial separation in the cerebellum of cholesterol/cholestanol-metabolizing P450s from a pool of metabolically available cholestanol; and (iii) weak cerebellar regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis. We identified a new physiological role of CYP46A1, an important brain enzyme and cytochrome P450 that could be activated pharmacologically."
https://openalex.org/W2586686752,"Argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ASS1), the rate-limiting enzyme for arginine biosynthesis, is expressed in many types of human malignancies. Recent studies showed that ASS1 may have tumor suppressor function and that ASS1 deficiency is associated with clinical aggressiveness in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, myxofibrosarcomas and bladder cancer. The goal of this study was to evaluate the prognostic impact of ASS1 expression in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Our study included two independent cohorts: untreated cohort, which was comprised of 135 patients with PDAC who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) without pre-operative neoadjuvant therapy, and treated cohort, which was comprised of 122 patients with PDAC who have completed neoadjuvant therapy and PD. The expression level of ASS1 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and the results were correlated with clinicopathologic parameters and survival using SPSS statistics. Our study showed that 12% of PDAC in untreated cohort and 15% of PDAC in treated cohort has low expression of ASS1 (ASS1-low). ASS1-low was associated with higher recurrence (p = 0.045), shorter disease-free survival (DFS, 4.8 ± 1.6 months vs 15.3 ± 2.2 months, p = 0.001) and shorter overall survival (OS, 14.6 ± 6.4 months vs 26.5 ± 3.5 months, p = 0.005) in untreated cohort and shorter OS in treated cohort compared to ASS1-high tumors. In multivariate analysis, ASS1-low (HR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.26-0.79, p = 0.005) was an independent prognostic factor for DFS in untreated cohort and an independent prognostic factor for OS (HR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.32-0.97, p = 0.04) in treated cohort. Our results provide supporting evidence for future clinical trial using arginine deprivation agents either alone or in combination with conventional chemotherapy in treating pancreatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2586878935,"This study analyzes two wind-induced upwelling mechanisms, namely, Ekman transport and Ekman pumping that occur during the southwest monsoon. The results suggest that the coastline of the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia (ECPM) is affected by upwelling with spatiotemporal variations. Characterization of upwelling by using wind-induced upwelling indexes (UIW) indicate the existence of favorable upwelling conditions from May to September. Upwelling intensity increased in May and peaked in August before declining in September, decreasing intensity from the southern tip towards the northern tip along the coastline of the ECPM. The existence of upwelling along the ECPM has resulted in an important difference between the SSTs of the inshore and the oceanic regions. Nonetheless, the use of the SST gradient between the inshore and the oceanic SSTs to characterize upwelling (UISST) was found to be unsuitable because the SST along the ECPM was affected by water advection from the Java Sea and incessant changes in the SST. In order to indicate the major contributor of wind-induced upwelling along the ECPM in terms of the spatiotemporal scale, a comparison between Ekman transport and Ekman pumping was drawn by integrating Ekman pumping with respect to the distance where the positive wind stress curl existed. The estimation of Ekman transport and Ekman pumping indicated that Ekman pumping played a major role in contributing towards upwelling in any particular month during the southwest monsoon along the entire coastline of the ECPM as compared to Ekman transport, which contributed towards more than half of the total upwelling transport. By dividing the ECPM into three coastal sections, we observed that Ekman pumping was relatively predominant in the middle and northern coasts, whereas both Ekman transport and Ekman pumping were equally prevalent in the southern coast."
https://openalex.org/W2587863552,"Regeneration of skeletal muscle is a complex process that requires the activation of quiescent adult stem cells, called satellite cells, which are resident in hypoxic niches in the tissue. Hypoxia has been recognized as a key factor to maintain stem cells in an undifferentiated state. Herein we report that hypoxia plays a fundamental role also in activating myogenesis. In particular, we found that the activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α under hypoxia, in murine skeletal myoblasts, leads to activation of MyoD through the noncanonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Moreover, chemical inhibition of HIF-1α activity significantly reduces differentiation, thus confirming its crucial role in the process. Furthermore, hypoxia-preconditioned myoblasts, once induced to differentiate under normoxic conditions, tend to form hypertrophic myotubes. These results support the notion that hypoxia plays a pivotal role in activating the regeneration process by directly inducing myogenesis through HIF-1α. Although preliminary, these findings may suggest new perspective for novel therapeutic targets in the treatment of several muscle diseases.-Cirillo, F., Resmini, G., Ghiroldi, A., Piccoli, M., Bergante, S., Tettamanti, G., Anastasia, L.

https://openalex.org/W2588154231,"The fluctuating CDK-CYCLIN complex plays a general role in cell-cycle control. Many types of stem cells use unique features of the cell cycle to facilitate asymmetric division. However, the manner in which these features are established remains poorly understood. The cell cycle of Drosophila female germline stem cells (GSCs) is characterized by short G1 and very long G2 phases, making it an excellent model for the study of cell cycle control in stem cell fate determination. Using a Drosophila female GSC model, we found Gcn5, the first discovered histone acetyltransferase, to maintain germline stem cells in Drosophila ovaries. Results showed that Gcn5 is dispensable for the transcriptional silencing of bam, but interacts with Cyclin A to facilitate proper turnover in GSCs. Results also showed that Gcn5 promotes Cyclin A ubiquitination, which is dependent on its acetylating activity. Finally, results showed that knockdown of Cyclin A rescued the GSC-loss phenotype caused by lack of Gcn5. Collectively, these findings support the conclusion that Gcn5 acts through acetylation to facilitate Cyclin A ubiquitination and proper turnover, thereby determining the fate of GSCs.—Liu, T., Wang, Q., Li, W., Mao, F., Yue, S., Liu, S., Liu, X., Xiao, S., Xia, L.

https://openalex.org/W2586830029,"Background Understanding the mechanisms of drug resistance can facilitate better management of antiretroviral therapy, helping to prevent transmission and decrease the morbidity and mortality of people living with HIV/AIDS. However, there is little data about transmitted drug resistance and acquired drug resistance for HIV/AIDS patients in Shanghai. Methods A retrospective cohort study of HIV-infected patients who visited the Department of Infectious Disease from June 2008 to June 2015 was conducted in Shanghai, China. Logistic regression analysis was performed to analyze risk factors for drug resistance among HIV-infected people with virological failure. The related collected factors included patient age, gender, marital status, infection route, baseline CD4 count, antiretroviral therapy regimens, time between HIV diagnosis and initiating antiretroviral therapy. Factors with p<0.1 in the univariate logistic regression test were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression test. Results There were 575 subjects selected for this study and 369 participated in this research. For the antiretroviral therapy drugs, the rates of transmitted drug resistance and acquired drug resistance were significantly different. The non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) had the highest drug resistance rate (transmitted drug resistance, 10.9%; acquired drug resistance, 53.3%) and protease inhibitors (PIs) had the lowest drug resistance rate (transmitted drug resistance, 1.7%; acquired drug resistance, 2.7%). Logistic regression analysis found no factors that were related to drug resistance except marital status (married status for tenofovir: odds ratio = 6.345, 95% confidence interval = 1.553–25.921, P = 0.010) and the time span between HIV diagnosis and initiating antiretroviral therapy (≤6M for stavudine: odds ratio = 0.271, 95% confidence interval = 0.086–0.850, P = 0.025; ≤6M for didanosine: odds ratio = 0.284, 95% confidence interval = 0.096–0.842, P = 0.023; ≤6M for tenofovir: odds ratio = 0.079, 95% confidence interval = 0.018–0.350,P<0.001). Conclusion NNRTI had a higher DR rate compared with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) and PIs, consequently, LPV/r was a reasonable choice for patients with NNRTI drugs resistance in China. Only married status and a time span≤6 month between the HIV confirmed date and the time initiating antiretroviral therapy were risk factors for TDF drug resistance. Both baseline HIV-RNA load and resistance test is crucial for TDR diagnosis, and frequent monitoring of HIV-RNA load is crucial for ADR identification and intervention. Treatment adherence still plays a positive role on the outcome of ART."

As similar insults are known to activate hyaluronan synthesis we explored the possibility that extracellular UTP or its breakdown products UDP and UMP act as mediators for hyaluronan synthase (HAS) activation in human epidermal keratinocytes. UTP increased hyaluronan both in the pericellular matrix and in the culture medium of HaCaT cells. 10–100 μm UTP strongly up-regulated HAS2 expression, although the other hyaluronan synthases (HAS1, HAS3) and hyaluronidases (HYAL1, HYAL2) were not affected. The HAS2 response was rapid and transient, with the maximum stimulation at 1.5 h. UDP exerted a similar effect, but higher concentrations were required for the response, and UMP showed no stimulation at all. Specific siRNAs against the UTP receptor P2Y2, and inhibitors of UDP receptors P2Y6 and P2Y14, indicated that the response to UTP was mediated mainly through P2Y2 and to a lesser extent via UDP receptors. UTP increased the phosphorylation of p38, ERK, CREB, and Ser-727 of STAT3 and induced nuclear translocation of pCaMKII. Inhibitors of PKC, p38, ERK, CaMKII, STAT3, and CREB partially blocked the activation of HAS2 expression, confirming the involvement of these pathways in the UTP-induced HAS2 response.

Hyaluronan is a linear, high molecular mass polysaccharide composed of glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine. The hyaluronan chain is built at the inner surface of the plasma membrane by hyaluronan synthase (HAS) enzymes, which also form a pore for hyaluronan transport into the extracellular space (21.Weigel Weigel Hascall Hascall Tammi Tammi Hyaluronan synthases.J.

The mechanisms of HAS up-regulation after trauma remain unresolved at the moment, although activation of the EGF family growth factors by an insult may at least partly explain the up-regulation of HAS2 and HAS3 (32.Monslow Monslow Sato Sato Mack Mack Maytin Maytin Wounding-induced synthesis of hyaluronic acid in organotypic epidermal cultures requires the release of heparin-binding egf and activation of the EGFR.J.

The present work explores the hypothesis that the extracellular nucleotide UTP and its breakdown products UDP and UMP contribute to the rapid HAS expression and hyaluronan accumulation after various skin traumas. We establish for the first time that extracellular UTP causes a pulse of hyaluronan synthesis via a strong, specific and rapid up-regulation of HAS2 expression, mediated by the activation of p38, ERK, STAT3, CaMKII and CREB, whereas the expressions of HAS1, HAS3, HYAL1, and HYAL2 are unaffected. High concentrations of UDP reproduce the effect, whereas UMP had no significant influence on HAS2 expression. The influence of UTP on hyaluronan metabolism of human keratinocytes was studied by treating HaCaT cells with 100 μm UTP and analyzing hyaluronan staining of the cultures and the amount of hyaluronan secreted in the growth medium. The staining intensity was clearly higher in the UTP-treated cultures compared with the untreated cultures already after a 2-h exposure (Fig. 1, A and B). Confocal imaging confirmed the accumulation of hyaluronan (Fig. 1, C and D) and showed its localization close to the plasma membranes as seen in the side views of the cell layers (Fig. 1, E and F). The histochemical stainings indicated an early activation of its synthesis. However, the amount of hyaluronan released into the culture medium was just slightly increased after a 4-h incubation, the more substantial increase requiring a 6-h incubation with UTP (Fig. 1, G and H). At that time point the amount of hyaluronan in the culture medium was increased by 24 and 46% in the cultures treated with 10 and 100 μm UTP, respectively (Fig. 1, G and H). To explore the cause of the increased hyaluronan secretion induced by UTP we first analyzed the possible influence of UTP on the level of the hyaluronan precursor sugars, UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GlcUA, known to control the rate of hyaluronan synthesis (34.Jokela Jokela Jauhiainen Jauhiainen Auriola Auriola Kauhanen Kauhanen Tiihonen Tiihonen Tammi Tammi Tammi Tammi Mannose inhibits hyaluronan synthesis by down-regulation of the cellular pool of UDP-N-acetylhexosamines.J.

No significant changes in their levels were, however, observed in the UTP-treated cells compared with untreated cultures (Fig. 2A), excluding their contribution to hyaluronan accumulation. Similarly, addition of UTP to the culture medium did not influence the amount of intracellular UTP (Fig. 2B). We then screened the expression levels of the hyaluronan-related genes by qRT-PCR at the 2-h time point (Fig. 2, C and D). HAS2 mRNA levels in the HaCaT cultures subjected to 100 μm UTP were markedly elevated, with a mean 9.2-fold increase (range 4–35-fold, n = 15) (Fig. 2C). UTP up-regulated HAS3 expression in some of the experiments, but the fold-change was more modest than for HAS2, and not statistically significant (Fig. 2D). The mRNA levels of HAS1, HYAL1, and HYAL2 were not influenced by UTP (Fig. 2D). Different doses of UTP applied into the culture medium showed that the maximum response to UTP was obtained at about 10 μm, whereas a 1 μm concentration induced just about 2-fold stimulation in HAS2 expression (Fig. 2E). The concentration of UTP needed to stimulate HAS2 expression exceeded that present under basal conditions (nanomolar range), but in stimulated keratinocytes UTP is released at micromolar concentrations (41.Gendaszewska-Darmach Gendaszewska-Darmach Kucharska Kucharska Nucleotide receptors as targets in the pharmacological enhancement of dermal wound healing.Purinergic Signal. 2011; 7: 193-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Under pathological conditions the concentration of ATP can reach even at 700 μm in the tumor microenvironment (42.Falzoni Falzoni Donvito Donvito Di Virgilio Di Virgilio Detecting adenosine triphosphate in the pericellular space.Interface Focus. 2013; 3: 20120101Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Under these conditions the concentration of UTP is also high, as it is released at a 1:3- 1:5 ratio to ATP in several cell types both under basal and mechanically stimulated conditions (41.Gendaszewska-Darmach Gendaszewska-Darmach Kucharska Kucharska Nucleotide receptors as targets in the pharmacological enhancement of dermal wound healing.Purinergic Signal. 2011; 7: 193-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The level of HAS2 mRNA started to rise already at 30 min after adding UTP, reaching its maximum at 1.5 h (Fig. 2F). Three hours after introduction of UTP the HAS2 mRNA rise had largely faded, and completely disappeared at the end of the 6-h follow-up (Fig. 2F). 100 μm UDP exhibited a comparable stimulatory effect on HAS2 expression as 100 μm UTP (Fig. 2G). However, the effect of 10 μm UDP was markedly smaller compared with 10 μm UTP (Fig. 2H). In contrast to UTP and UDP, 100 μm of the monophosphate UMP tended to down-regulate HAS2 expression although the response did not reach statistical significance (0.6-fold) (Fig. 2G). UTP is known to signal via the G-protein-associated receptors P2Y2 and P2Y4, whereas UDP utilizes P2Y6 and P2Y14 (43.Burnstock Burnstock Purinergic signalling: Its unpopular beginning, its acceptance and its exciting future.Bioessays. 2012; 34: 218-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar).

We observed that the SAM domain is comprised of two binding regions that lead to the formation of dimers and higher-order oligomers.

Mapping revealed an α helix 5 (H5) within the SAM domain that contributed to its ability to self-associate. Retention of H5 in the absence of other helices (H1-H4) was sufficient to support T cell activation and microcluster formation, albeit at a higher rate compared with wild-type SLP-76 (22.Liu H. Thaker Y.R. Stagg L. Schneider H. Ladbury J.E. Rudd C.E. SLP-76 sterile α motif (SAM) and individual H5 α helix mediate oligomer formation for microclusters and t-cell activation.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 29539-29549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Despite this progress, the mechanisms underlying SAM domain functions remain unclear. In this study, we have examined the capacity of the SLP-76 SAM domain to interact with other SAM domain-carrying proteins. We investigated kinases retrieved from the Sugen/Salk Kinase Database (KinBase) present in the human kinome (32.Caenepeel S. Charydczak G. Sudarsanam S. Hunter T. Manning G. The mouse kinome: discovery and comparative genomics of all mouse protein kinases.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 11707-11712Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 33.Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. The protein kinase complement of the human genome.Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6234) Google Scholar) that contained several SAM kinases with N-terminal SAM domains. We reasoned that the N-terminal domains may have evolved an ability to interact with other N-terminal domains. This led to the identification of activated cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42)-associated tyrosine kinase 1 (ACK1) as a kinase that associates with SLP-76 in a SAM-dependent manner and regulates its phosphorylation and aspects of T cell signaling. The N terminus SAM domain of SLP-76 is essential for optimal T cell signaling, microcluster formation, IL-2 production, and NFAT activity (22.Liu H. Thaker Y.R. Stagg L. Schneider H. Ladbury J.E. Rudd C.E. SLP-76 sterile α motif (SAM) and individual H5 α helix mediate oligomer formation for microclusters and t-cell activation.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 29539-29549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, little is understood regarding molecular events regulating these functions. Previous studies have documented the importance of ZAP-70-mediated phosphorylation of SLP-76 in the regulation of T cell responses (28.Bubeck Wardenburg J. Fu C. Jackman J.K. Flotow H. Wilkinson S.E. Williams D.H. Johnson R. Kong G. Chan A.C. Findell P.R. Phosphorylation of SLP-76 by the ZAP-70 Protein-tyrosine kinase is required for T-cell receptor function.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19641-19644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). It has remained an open question whether other kinases exist in T cells that mediate SLP-76 phosphorylation and promote its function. In particular, we were interested in whether SAM domain-carrying kinases could bind to SLP-76, leading to its phosphorylation. A search of several databases, including KinBase, led to the identification of the N-terminal SAM domain kinases ACK1 (or Tnk2, tyrosine kinase non-receptor 2) and ACK2 (or Tnk1, tyrosine kinase non-receptor 1) (Fig. 1A). Intriguingly, the highest expression levels of ACK1 are found in the spleen, the thymus, and the brain (34.Galisteo M.L. Yang Y. Ureña J. Schlessinger J. Activation of the nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase Ack by multiple extracellular stimuli.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 9796-9801Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Analysis of entries in the microarray database also showed the highest expression of ACK1 in lymphocytes, such as CD4 conventional and regulatory T cell populations, which was further confirmed by quantitative real-time-PCR and Western blotting (supplemental Fig. S1). SAM-containing proteins can bind other proteins and form homo- or heterodimers and may even form multimers (22.Liu H. Thaker Y.R. Stagg L. Schneider H. Ladbury J.E. Rudd C.E. SLP-76 sterile α motif (SAM) and individual H5 α helix mediate oligomer formation for microclusters and t-cell activation.J. Biol.

STKE. 2005; 2005: re7Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). To evaluate the possible interaction of ACK1 with endogenous SLP-76, Myc-tagged ACK1 was expressed in Jurkat T cells by transfection, followed by ligation with 2 or 4 μg/ml of soluble anti-CD3 for 5 min. ACK1 protein was precipitated with anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 1B). A small amount of endogenous SLP-76 was co-precipitated with anti-Myc (Fig. 1B, lane 1), which was markedly increased with anti-CD3 (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 3). As controls, anti-Myc detected Myc-ACK1 and anti-SLP-76 detected SLP-76 in cell lysates (Fig. 1B, bottom panels). These results indicated that endogenous SLP-76 could be co-precipitated with transfected ACK1, and the association was increased with anti-CD3 stimulation. We also observed binding in murine primary resting mouse T cells by precipitation using an anti-SLP-76 antibody followed by anti-ACK1 blotting (Fig. 1C). Purified CD4+ T cells were isolated from mouse spleen and activated with soluble anti-CD3 for 5 min. Anti-SLP-76 co-precipitated ACK1 in resting cells (Fig. 1C, left panel, lane 1) that was increased with anti-CD3 (Fig. 1C, left panel, lane 2, and right panel). Binding between SLP-76-EYFP and Myc-ACK1 could also be observed in transfected non-hematopoietic HEK293T cells (Fig. 2, A, lane 2, and B, lane 6). Additionally, in situ proximity hybridization (PLA) of ACK1 and SLP-76 gave a positive signal that was indicative of close proximity in HEK293T cells (Fig. 2C, top left panel, yellow dots). Together, these findings indicate, for the first time, that ACK1 and SLP-76 bind to each other in different cell lines, including Jurkat and primary T cells. To assess the binding sites between ACK1 and SLP-76, we expressed various SLP-76 mutants in non-hematopoietic HEK293T cells with Myc-tagged ACK1 (Fig. 2A). Anti-SLP-76 co-precipitated the Myc-ACK1 protein and wild-type SLP-76 (Fig. 2A, lane 2). By contrast, anti-SLP-76 co-precipitated a much reduced ACK1 band from cells expressing the mutant SLP76-ΔSAM (residues 1–78 deletion) (Fig. 2A, lane 6) or SLP-76 lacking proximal tyrosines 3Y3F (tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutants) (Fig. 2A, lane 4). By contrast, in another experiment, a single mutation of Tyr-128 or Tyr-145 to phenylalanine did not disrupt binding (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 4), suggesting possible cooperativity among the three tyrosine residues. Further, in an in situ proximity ligation assay (PLA), anti-Myc and anti-HA antibodies were employed with the DuolinkTM detection system in HEK293T cells (Fig. 2C). Cells were transfected with Myc-ACK1 to bind anti-Myc and HA-tagged SLP-76 to bind anti-HA. From this, a strong signal was seen between ACK1 and SLP-76 (Fig. 2C, left panel, top left). This was consistent with the co-precipitation of Myc-ACK1 in anti-HA precipitates of HA-SLP-76 (Fig. 2C, right panel, lane 4). By contrast, co-expression of Myc-ACK1 with HA-SLP76-ΔSAM (Fig. 2C, left panel, center row) or HA-SLP76–3Y3F (Fig. 2C, left panel, bottom row) failed to show a positive PLA signal or to be co-precipitated in anti-HA SLP-76 precipitations (Fig. 2C, right panel, lanes 5 and 6). Collectively, these findings showed that the interaction between ACK1 and SLP-76 was dependent on the SLP-76 SAM domain and proximal tyrosine residues at 113, 128, and 145. Consistent with these findings, we next showed the co-localization of SLP-76 and ACK1 using laser-scanning confocal microscopy of Jurkat cells on anti-CD3-coated glass coverslips (Fig. 3, left panel). Cells were imaged over a time course in response to anti-CD3 ligation. Representative 3D projections of deconvolved images of T cells treated with anti-CD3 (Fig. 3, top right panel, a (0 min), c (2 min), e (5 min), and g (10 min)) were used to assess the co-localization coefficient (Fig. 3, top right panel, b, d, f, and h). An increase in co-localization was seen in response to anti-CD3 by 2 min, and this remained stable until 10 min. Pearson's correlation coefficient values of 0.51 at 2 min and 0.49 at 5 min revealed significant overlap between SLP-76 (green) and ACK1 (red) upon stimulation compared with the resting control group (Fig. 3, bottom panel, histogram). Antibody specificity controls are shown in supplemental Fig. S1D). These findings provide strong evidence of SLP-76 binding to ACK1. In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that tyrosines 113, 128, and 145 in the acidic N-terminal region of SLP-76 are critical for supporting T cell functions (27.Raab M. da Silva A.J. Findell P.R. Rudd C.E.

Given our evidence that SLP-76 binds to ACK1, we next investigated whether ACK1 can also phosphorylate SLP-76. We co-expressed SLP-76-EYFP or the 3Y3F-SLP76-EYFP mutant with ACK1 or empty vector in HEK293T cells, followed by precipitation with anti-GFP and blotting with various antibodies (Fig. 4). Expression of SLP-76 with empty vector revealed no detectable tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 4A, lane 1). By contrast, ACK1 co-expression with SLP-76 resulted in its significant phosphorylation (Fig. 4A, lane 2). Further, ACK1 failed to phosphorylate the SLP-76 tyrosine mutant 3Y3F lacking all three proximal tyrosines (Fig. 4A, lane 4). In view of the result showing that deletion of the SAM domain disrupted binding of ACK1 to SLP-76 (Fig. 2A), we also assessed whether the loss of this domain affected tyrosine phosphorylation. SLP-76 wild-type, SLP76-ΔSAM, or 3Y3F were co-expressed with ACK1 (Fig. 4B). SLP-76 was then immunoprecipitated, and tyrosine phosphorylation was assessed by blotting. As before, wild-type SLP-76 became phosphorylated when co-expressed with ACK1 (Fig. 4B, lane 2). However, the SLP76-ΔSAM mutant (Fig. 4B, lane 6) and the 3Y3F mutant (Fig. 4B, lane 4) failed to become tyrosine-phosphorylated. The binding data showed that ACK1 sustained binding to Y128F and Y145F mutants, suggesting that two of three unmutated tyrosines are sufficient for binding (Fig. 2B). Based on this, we speculated that mutation of a single tyrosine residue in the 3Y motif will still permit phosphorylation of the remaining intact tyrosines (i.e. Tyr-113 and Tyr-145 when Tyr-128 is mutated and Tyr-113 and Tyr-128 when Tyr-145 is mutated). Unexpectedly, however, a point mutation of Tyr-128 or Tyr-145 to phenylalanine abolished phosphorylation of the entire 3Y motif (Fig. 4C). This finding demonstrates that ACK1 concurrently phosphorylates all three residues and requires an intact N-terminal SAM and the three N-terminal tyrosines. The Tyr-113 mutant was not included in this study. Therefore, the likelihood of Tyr-128 and Tyr-145 being co-phosphorylated in the absence of Tyr-113 could not be ruled out. However, these results suggest concurrent phosphorylation of tyrosines 113, 128, and 145. Emphasizing the critical role of the 3Y residues, previous studies have established that, in SLP-76-deficient cells, the 3Y3F mutant fails to rescue PLCγ1 phosphorylation, calcium flux, and NFAT transcriptional activity (37.Koretzky G.A. Abtahian F. Silverman M.A. SLP76 and SLP65: complex regulation of signalling in lymphocytes and beyond.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). To determine the functional consequence of ACK1 in this context, we made use of CD4+ primary mouse T cells transfected with ACK1 or a control vector (Fig. 5A). Cells were loaded with the intracellular calcium indicator Indo-1 dye and assessed for their ability to support the influx of extracellular calcium in response to suboptimal anti-CD3 concentrations. CD4+ T cells expressing ACK1 showed an enhanced influx of calcium in response to anti-CD3. Anti-Myc blotting confirmed the expression of transfected protein (Fig. 5A, fourth panel). Consistent with this, ACK1 exogenous expression also increased NFAT/AP1 promoter activity (Fig. 5B). In addition, the effect of ACK1 on T cell motility was examined (Fig. 6). ACK1 has been implicated previously in hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis (38.Xie B. Zen Q. Wang X. He X. Xie Y. Zhang Z. Li H. ACK1 promotes hepatocellular carcinoma progression via downregulating WWOX and activating AKT signaling.Int. J. Oncol. 2015; 46: 2057-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We observed a decrease in the random motility of T cells upon exogenous ACK1 expression compared with wild-type cells on ICAM-1-coated plates (Fig. 6, left panel). Further, consistent with this, inhibition of endogenous ACK1 activity by pretreatment of cells with an ACK1 inhibitor (AIM-100) resulted in significantly"

In the presence of MalE, the MalK dimer becomes fully closed, gaining the ability to hydrolyze ATP. In the presence of ADP or maltose, MalE·MalFGK2 remains essentially in a semi-closed symmetric conformation, indicating that release of these ligands is required for the return to the initial state.

https://openalex.org/W2586988608,"Background The efficacy of devices for difficult intubation in paediatric patients, especially with a Cormack-Lehane grade 4 view, has yet to be established. We compared intubating parameters among three devices (the Airtraq®, McGrath®, and Macintosh laryngoscopes). Methods This study is a randomised cross-over trial. Participants were 20 anaesthetists. Each device was tested three times using a paediatric manikin with a Cormack-Lehane grade 4 view. The order to use each device was randomised by a computer-generated random sequence. The primary endpoint was the rate of successful intubation. Secondary endpoints included the time taken to intubate, percentage of glottic opening score, and severity of potential dental trauma. Results The successful intubation rates of the Airtraq®, McGrath®, and Macintosh laryngoscopes were 100%, 72%, and 45%, respectively. The risk ratio of the success rates of Airtraq® compared with McGrath® and Macintosh laryngoscopes were 1.40 (95% CI; 1.19–1.64, P < 0.001) and 2.22 (95% CI; 1.68–2.94, P < 0.001), respectively. The modified Cormack-Lehane grade and percentage of the glottic opening score were better for the Airtraq® than for the other devices. The dental trauma score was lower for the Airtraq® than for the other devices. There were no significant differences in the intubation time among the groups. Conclusions The Airtraq® had higher success rate, had better visibility, and was associated with less dental trauma than the other devices in a difficult paediatric intubation model with a Cormack-Lehane grade 4 view."

This study aimed to define a new clinical cut-off of CK19 mRNA copy number based on the calculation of the risk that an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) will be positive. We analyzed 1529 SLNs from 1140 patients with the OSNA assay and 318 patients with positive SLNs for micrometastasis (250 copies) and macrometastasis (5000 copies) underwent ALND. Axillary non–SLNs were routinely examined. ROC curves and Youden’s index were performed in order to identify a new cut-off value. Logistic regression models were performed in order to compare OSNA categorical variables created on the basis of our and traditional cut-off to better identify patients who really need an axillary dissection. 69% and 31% of OSNA positive patients had a negative and positive ALND, respectively. ROC analysis identified a cut-off of 2150 CK19 mRNA copies with 95% sensitivity and 51% specificity. Positive and negative predictive values of this new cut-off were 47% and 96%, respectively. Logistic regression models indicated that the cut-off of 2150 copies better discriminates patients with node negative or positive in comparison with the conventional OSNA cut-off (p<0.0001). This cut-off identifies false positive and false negative cases and true-positive and true negative cases very efficiently, and therefore better identifies which patients really need an ALND and which patients can avoid one. This is why we suggest that the negative cut-off should be raised from 250 to 2150. Furthermore, we propose that for patients with a copy number that ranges between 2150 and 5000, there should be a multidisciplinary discussion concerning the clinical and bio-morphological features of primary breast cancer before any decision is taken on whether to perform an ALND or not."
https://openalex.org/W2587195057,"Euchambersia mirabilis is an iconic species of Permo-Triassic therapsid because of its unusually large external maxillary fossa linked through a sulcus to a ridged canine. This anatomy led to the commonly accepted conclusion that the large fossa accommodated a venom gland. However, this hypothesis remains untested so far. Here, we conducted a μCT scan assisted reappraisal of the envenoming capacity of Euchambersia, with a special focus on the anatomy of the maxillary fossa and canines. This study shows that the fossa, presumably for the venom-producing gland, is directly linked to the maxillary canal, which carries the trigeminal nerve (responsible for the sensitivity of the face). The peculiar anatomy of the maxillary canal suggests important reorganisation in the somatosensory system and that a ganglion could possibly have been present in the maxillary fossa instead of a venom gland. Nevertheless, the venom gland hypothesis is still preferred since we describe, for the first time, the complete crown morphology of the incisiform teeth of Euchambersia, which strongly suggests that the complete dentition was ridged. Therefore Euchambersia manifests evidence of all characteristics of venomous animals: a venom gland (in the maxillary fossa), a mechanism to deliver the venom (the maxillary canal and/or the sulcus located ventrally to the fossa); and an apparatus with which to inflict a wound for venom delivery (the ridged dentition)."

https://openalex.org/W2587203319,"Background We developed a novel pedicled DIEP flap model in rat to explore the possible remedy for the distal necrosis of the flap. Methods A deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap, based on the second right cranial perforator (P2) as the main pedicle, was elevated in 48 Sprague-Dawley rats. The rats were randomized into 4 groups: group I, the left P2 remaining intact as supercharging; group II, the left P2 artery alone kept as supercharging; group III, the left P2 vein alone kept as supercharging; group IV, no supercharging. Transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2) and transcutaneous carbon dioxide pressure (TcPCO2) were measured immediately after flap elevation, protein level of Hif-1a was measured 48 hours later, and flap survival was assessed 7 days postoperatively. Results Blockade of artery led to significantly lower TcPO2, higher TcPCO2, and higher expression level of Hif-1a in the distal side of the flap in group III and group IV, than those of group I and group II. At 7 days post surgery, significantly lower flap survival rates were observed in group III (81.9 ± 5.7%) and group IV (78.4 ± 6.5%), compared to observed in group I (97.2 ± 3.0%) and group II (94.2 ± 6.2%).

https://openalex.org/W2587303912,"Many allosteric proteins form homo-oligomeric complexes to regulate a biological function. In homo-oligomers, subunits establish communication pathways that are modulated by external stimuli like ligand binding. A challenge for dissecting the communication mechanisms in homo-oligomers is identifying intermediate liganded states, which are typically transiently populated. However, their identities provide the most mechanistic information on how ligand-induced signals propagate from bound to empty subunits. Here, we dissected the directionality and magnitude of subunit communication in a reengineered single-chain version of the homodimeric transcription factor cAMP receptor protein. By combining wild-type and mutant subunits in various asymmetric configurations, we revealed a linear relationship between the magnitude of cooperative effects and the number of mutant subunits. We found that a single mutation is sufficient to change the global allosteric behavior of the dimer even when one subunit was wild type. Dimers harboring two mutations with opposite cooperative effects had different allosteric properties depending on the arrangement of the mutations. When the two mutations were placed in the same subunit, the resulting cooperativity was neutral. In contrast, when placed in different subunits, the observed cooperativity was dominated by the mutation with strongest effects over cAMP affinity relative to wild type. These results highlight the distinct roles of intrasubunit interactions and intersubunit communication in allostery. Finally, dimers bound to either one or two cAMP molecules had similar DNA affinities, indicating that both asymmetric and symmetric liganded states activate DNA interactions.

Despite its importance, dissecting the mechanisms of transduction of allosteric signals from one protein subunit to another has proven difficult because it requires monitoring intermediate liganded states that are poorly populated, especially if the protein displays positive ligand binding cooperativity. Therefore, one of the remaining unresolved issues in allostery is dissecting the directionality of pathways of signal transmissions across protein subunits. A widely used strategy to perturb and examine the mechanisms of intersubunit communication in homo-oligomeric systems is to evaluate a mutation or combinations of mutations on binding or catalytic activities. However, in homo-oligomers mutations are present in all subunits, making it difficult to quantitatively dissect mutational effects from one subunit to another. To overcome this obstacle, in this study we reengineered the homodimeric transcription factor cAMP receptor protein (CRP) 3The abbreviations used are: CRPcAMP receptor proteinCRPscCRP single-chain dimerITCisothermal titration calorimetryGdnHClguanidine hydrochlorideANS8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acidccooperativityPDBProtein Data Bank. into a single chain by covalently linking the two identical CRP subunits through an unstructured polypeptide linker (Fig. 1A). The CRP single-chain dimer (CRPSC) allowed us to construct asymmetric CRP dimers harboring either a wild-type and a mutant subunit or subunits with different mutation types. Specifically, the mutations S62F and D53H have been shown to reduce and enhance cAMP binding cooperativity, respectively. By placing these two mutations in various asymmetric configurations, we dissected the directionality and magnitude of mutational perturbations from one subunit to another, thereby providing a unique opportunity to examine communication pathways within and across CRP subunits. cAMP receptor protein CRP single-chain dimer isothermal titration calorimetry guanidine hydrochloride 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid cooperativity Protein Data Bank. Each CRP subunit has two functionally and structurally distinct domains, a cAMP-binding domain in the N terminus that is also responsible for dimer formation and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain (Fig. 1B). CRP binds two cAMP molecules and undergoes a conformational change in the DNA-binding domains that enables the protein to interact with high affinity and specificity with DNA promoter sequences (13.Lin S.H.

Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 655-658Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular architecture of CRP is ideal for quantitative studies on the mechanisms of transduction of allosteric signals because: 1) cAMP binding reports on intersubunit communication and cooperative interactions, and 2) DNA binding reports on intrasubunit interactions and cAMP-induced conformational changes of the protein (13.Lin S.H.

Our results show that CRPSC is indistinguishable from the wild-type CRP homodimer based on solution structure, thermodynamic stability, and cAMP binding affinities and cooperativity. As seen in the wild-type CRP (13.Lin S.H. Lee J.C. Communications between the high-affinity cyclic nucleotide binding sites in E. coli cyclic AMP receptor protein: effect of single site mutations.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11857-11867Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the DNA binding activity of CRPSC is allosterically controlled by cAMP. We find that combinations of wild-type and mutant subunits in CRPSC result in cAMP binding affinities and cooperativities that are different from those of the parental proteins (i.e. wild-type CRP or variants with the same mutation in both subunits). Furthermore, we show that mutations with opposite effects on cAMP binding affinity have dramatically different consequences on cooperative interactions whether the mutations are in the same subunit or in different ones. Finally, we find that asymmetric mutants bound to one cAMP molecule have indistinguishable DNA binding affinity constants compared with the doubly liganded CRPSC, which suggests that a single cAMP molecule bound to CRP is sufficient to allosterically drive the conformational changes required for robust interactions with DNA, and it underscores the role of asymmetric liganded states in the regulation of gene expression (19.Lin S.-H. Lee J.C. Linkage of multiequilibria in DNA recognition by the D53H Escherichia coli cAMP receptor protein.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14935-14943Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We engineered a CRP single-chain dimer (CRPSC) that connects the C terminus of the first CRP subunit to the N terminus of the second one through a flexible polypeptide linker of the repeat sequence (SGGGG)7 (Fig. 1A). Based on the CRP structures in the unliganded and cAMP-bound states (14.McKay D.B. Steitz T.A.

The designed linker spans a larger distance (∼130 Å) to accommodate the protein's conformational changes induced by cAMP binding. CRPSC migrated as a 48-kDa protein in an SDS denaturing gel, twice the molecular mass of one CRP subunit (Fig. 2A). During the purification process, gel filtration chromatograms of CRPSC had the same elution volume as of wild-type CRP corroborating that in native conditions CRPSC eluted as a pseudodimer (Fig. 2B). During consecutive size exclusion runs, no peaks were observed before CRPSC elution (data not shown), which otherwise would have indicated the formation of a dimer of dimers or other high-order oligomeric states. Moreover, CRPSC and wild-type CRP had identical CD spectra (Fig. 2C), indicating that the global fold and secondary structure content of the two proteins are the same. We evaluated the effect of the polypeptide linker on the thermodynamic stability of CRPSC by monitoring changes in tryptophan fluorescence (Fig. 2D) and circular dichroism (data not shown) as a function of GdnHCl concentration. At the experimental conditions, CRPSC and wild-type CRP displayed a single unfolding transition and had similar fitted thermodynamic parameters (ΔG0 and m values) that are in agreement with previously published data (supplemental Table S1) (20.Li J. Lee J.C. Modulation of allosteric behavior through adjustment of the differential stability of the two interacting domains in E. coli cAMP receptor protein.Biophys. Chem. 2011; 159: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Having established that the solution structure and the thermodynamic stability between CRPSC and wild-type CRP are very similar, we investigated whether the polypeptide linker affected the basic function of CRP, namely the allosteric activation of DNA binding by cAMP. We used electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) to monitor the interaction of CRPSC and wild-type CRP to three different lengths of the lac promoter made by 26, 32, and 40 bp (Fig. 2E). The different promoter lengths were used to test whether the polypeptide linker in the CRPSC construct contributed to nonspecific binding to DNA flanking sequences. In the presence of saturating amounts of cAMP, we observed robust DNA binding for both CRPSC and wild-type CRP. Moreover, for all promoter lengths we observed a single band, indicating that the polypeptide linker does not contribute to nonspecific DNA binding. In the absence of cAMP, no DNA binding was observed for both proteins. These results indicate that the polypeptide linker in CRPSC does not affect the cAMP-dependent allosteric activation of the protein. To quantitatively determine whether CRPSC had cAMP-binding association constants similar to those reported for wild-type CRP, we used a published method based on changes in 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS) fluorescence to measure cAMP binding (13.Lin S.H. Lee J.C.

Fig. 3A shows that the cAMP titration curves for CRPSC and wild-type CRP almost completely overlapped, resulting in indistinguishable microscopic association constants using a two binding-site model (supplemental Table S1). We further validated the fluorescence data using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The ITC data revealed similar microscopic cAMP-binding association constants between CRPSC and wild-type CRP (supplemental Fig. S1 and supplemental Table S2). As with wild-type CRP, the sequential binding of two cAMP molecules to CRPSC showed an initial exothermic phase followed by an endothermic phase. This biphasic behavior agrees with previous ITC studies (13.Lin S.H. Lee J.C.

DNA binding constants were obtained by monitoring anisotropy changes during the formation of the complex CRP-DNA using a 32-bp fluorescein-labeled lac promoter (Fig. 3B). The data showed that both CRPSC and wild-type CRP have similar binding affinities for the lac promoter fragment in the presence of 200 μm cAMP, a concentration wherein both binding sites are occupied. Noteworthy, the maximal anisotropy levels were slightly higher with the CRPSC, suggesting a more rigid protein-DNA complex. Control experiments in the absence of cAMP showed negligible DNA binding (supplemental Table S1). Altogether, the results from these quantitative studies demonstrate that the presence of the polypeptide linker that connects the two CRP subunits does not perturb cAMP binding or DNA binding activities. Two previously well characterized mutations, S62F and D53H (13.Lin S.H. Lee J.C.

In wild-type CRP, the mutation S62F decreases the affinity to cAMP and generates negative cooperativity between the two cAMP-binding domains. In contrast, the mutation D53H has small effects on cAMP binding affinity to the first site, but it significantly increases the affinity for the second one, thereby generating positive binding cooperativity. We first placed these mutations in both subunits of the CRPSC (also referred as symmetric mutants) to corroborate the same mutational effects reported for wild-type CRP. The symmetric CRPSC mutant harboring S62F (CRPSCS/S) had an association constant for the first cAMP-binding site, k1, 10 times lower than that for the wild-type CRPSC (CRPSCWT/WT), and it displayed negative cooperativity (cS/S = k2/k1 = 0.12). In contrast, the symmetric CRPSC mutant harboring D53H (CRPSCD/D) had similar k1 values compared with CRPSCWT/WT, and it showed positive cooperativity (cD/D = 8.8) (Fig. 4A and Table 1). These results are quantitatively very similar to what has been reported by others (13.Lin S.H. Lee J.C.

We evaluated the directionality and magnitude of the mutational effect on cAMP binding affinity by comparing the binding affinities of the first and second sites (k1 and k2) of the single asymmetric CRPSC mutants with the parental symmetric proteins, namely CRPSCWT/WT, CRPSCS/S, and CRPSCD/D. Fig. 4B shows cAMP titrations for the single asymmetric mutants S62F (CRPSCS/WT) and D53H (CRPSCD/WT), respectively. Interestingly, for both asymmetric CRPSC mutants, k1 and k2 did not correspond to a simple linear combination of affinities of the wild-type or symmetric mutant proteins (Table 1). For example, k1 for CRPSCS/WT was 7 times higher than for CRPSCS/S and 1.5 times lower than for CRPSCWT/WT, whereas k2 was 10 times higher than for CRPSCS/S and 13 times lower than for CRPSCWT/WT. For CRPSCD/WT, k1 was similar to CRPSCWT/WT and CRPSCD/D, but k2 was 3 times higher than for CRPSCWT/WT and 2 times lower than for CRPSCD/D. Altogether, these results clearly show bidirectional effects between mutant and wild-type CRP subunits and underscore that a single mutation in a single subunit is sufficient to alter the global allosteric behavior of the dimer even when the other subunit remained wild type. The effects of asymmetric mutants on cAMP binding affinities resulted in intermediate values of cAMP binding cooperativity compared with symmetric CRPSC mutants. The cooperativities for CRPSCS/WT and CRPSCD/WT were cS/WT = 0.2 and cD/WT = 4.1, whereas for CRPSCS/S and CRPSCD/D, the cooperativities were cS/S = 0.12 and cD/D = 8.8, respectively. Interestingly, although the mutations S62F and D53H have opposite cooperative effects, the magnitude of their cooperative effect over the affinity of the second cAMP-binding site was similar. For example, CRPSCS/WT and CRPSCD/WT reduced and increased the affinity for the second cAMP-binding site 5- and 4-fold, respectively, whereas CRPSCS/S and CRPSCD/D reduced and increased the affinity 8- and 9-fold, respectively (Table 1). To investigate the roles of intersubunit communication and intrasubunit interactions in cAMP binding cooperativity, we placed the S62F and D53H mutations in CRPSC in two different configurations (referred as double asymmetric mutants). To study intersubunit communication, we constructed a CRPSC harboring the S62F mutation in one subunit and the D53H in the neighboring one (CRPSCS/D). To study intrasubunit interactions, we constructed a CRPSC harboring both mutations in the same subunit, whereas the other one remained wild type (CRPSCS+D/WT). Given the similar magnitudes in their cooperative effects, the two CRPSC mutant configurations allowed us to determine to what extent intersubunit communication or intrasubunit interactions neutralize the opposite cooperative effects of S62F and D53H. The cAMP titrations of CRPSCS/D and CRPSCS+D/WT revealed important differences in cAMP binding affinity and cooperativity (Fig. 4C). CRPSCS/D, with the two mutations in opposing subunits, displayed negative cooperativity (cS/D = 0.25) as seen in CRPSCS/S and CRPSCS/WT. However, the cooperativity in CRPSCS/D was not as low as in CRPSCS/S and CRPSCS/WT, indicating that the positive cooperative effects exerted by mutation D53H were transduced to the neighboring subunit harboring the mutation S62F. Surprisingly, CRPSCS+D/WT, with the two mutations in the same subunit, showed neutral cooperativity (cS+D/WT = 1.1), albeit k1 and k2 were 50% lower than those of the wild-type protein. Thus, despite the fact that the two mutations in CRPSCS+D/WT significantly reduced the cAMP binding affinity in both binding sites, any cooperative effects transduced from the double mutant subunit to the neighboring wild-type subunit were negligible. Thus, these results show that opposing cooperative effects are better counterbalanced through intrasubunit interactions than via intersubunit communication. One could speculate that the functional differences between CRPSCS/D and CRPSCS+D/WT were due to destabilization of the secondary structures introduced by the mutations. However, chemical denaturation experiments monitored by CD and tryptophan fluorescence showed little differences in ΔG0 and m values between these two proteins (supplemental Fig. S2 and supplemental Table S3), which argues that the mutations do not alter the global fold of the protein, but instead their effects over cooperative interactions may arise from changes in the motions of the protein. In fact, previous studies have shown a correlation between protein motions and cAMP binding cooperativity in CRP (23.Gekko K. Obu N. Li J. Lee J.C. A linear correlation between the energetics of allosteric communication and protein flexibility in the Escherichia coli cyclic AMP receptor protein revealed by mutation-induced changes in compressibility and amide hydrogen-deuterium exchange.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3844-3852Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 29.Yu S.

Chem. 2012; 287: 39402-39411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Therefore, our results show that CRPSC is an ideal construct to examine how changes in protein motions in a single subunit modulate the behavior of the neighboring one through the dimer interface, i.e. intersubunit communication mediated by quaternary interactions. It is well established that CRP bound to two cAMP molecules interacts with high affinity and specificity to DNA promoter sequences (13.Lin S.H. Lee J.C. Communications between the high-affinity cyclic nucleotide binding sites in E. coli cyclic AMP receptor protein: effect of single site mutations.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11857-11867Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Less understood, however, is the role of the singly cAMP-bound conformation in transcription regulation and DNA interactions. Because both CRPSCWT/WT and the wild-type CRP displayed positive cooperativity between the two cAMP-binding domains (Table 1 and supplemental Table 1), the singly cAMP-bound intermediate state is poorly populated and thus difficult to isolate and characterize. However, the asymmetric mutants CRPSCS/D, CRPSCS/WT, and CRPSCS/S displayed negative cAMP binding cooperativity, enabling us to populate the singly cAMP-bound conformation and examine its interaction and binding affinity for the lac promoter. Based on the cAMP binding data for CRPSCS/D and CRPSCS/WT, the highest ratio of singly to doubly cAMP-bound populations was obtained when [cAMP] = 30 μm. At this cAMP concentration, the distribution of populations of unliganded, singly cAMP-bound, and doubly bound states is ∼34, 60, and 6%, respectively (supplemental Fig. S3). Because of the negligible interaction between the unliganded CRP and the lac promoter, the total change in anisotropy at 30 μm cAMP, which reflects the formation of the CRP-DNA complex, corresponds to ∼91% to the singly cAMP-bound conformation and 9% to the doubly bound state. Fig. 5A shows the DNA binding data of CRPSCS/D using [cAMP] = 0, 30, and 1000 μm. Surprisingly, the titrations at 30 and 1000 μm revealed that"

FVB/Db and wild-type FVB mice were evaluated for changes in neuroinflammation, virus clearance, neuropathology, and development of brain atrophy via T2-weighted MRI and subsequent 3-dimensional volumetric analysis. Significant brain atrophy and hippocampal neuronal loss were observed in TMEV-infected FVB/Db mice, but not in wild-type FVB mice. Brain atrophy was observed at 1 mo postinfection and persisted through the 4-mo observation period. Of importance, virus-infected FVB/Db mice elicited a strong CD8 T-cell response toward the immunodominant Db-restricted TMEV-derived peptide, VP2121–130, and cleared TMEV from the CNS. In addition, immunofluorescence revealed CD8 T cells near virus-infected neurons; therefore, we hypothesize that class I restricted CD8 T-cell responses promote development of brain atrophy.

Limited access to the profusion of sequence information derived from cancer patients worldwide stymies basic research and clinical decisions. Efforts are underway to streamline and safeguard data use. “We’ve whittled down from 2,000 patients to ‘here’s the 144 patients that fit your trial.’ Boom. Done.”Data collected from tens of thousands of cancer patients have been deposited in worldwide databases with the hopes that sharing information will spur development of new therapies. Despite this collaborative intent, getting access to the data can sometimes be a struggle, as David Haussler found out while trying to expand his research in cancer genomics. “We were rejected on a certain dataset because we didn’t specify [that] the work we were doing with it was strictly pediatric cancer work,” says Haussler, who uses computational techniques to explore the molecular functions of the human genome at the University of California, Santa Cruz. “You couldn’t get the data if you weren’t restricting your work to pediatric cancer.” It’s not that he lacks experience with sharing data. He’s the director of the UCSC Cancer Genomics Hub, an online repository that makes available sequencing data generated by programs of the National Cancer Institute. He co-chairs a group under the umbrella of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) to standardize genomic and clinical data so that it can be easily shared among researchers. And way back in 2000, his team was the first to post publically available human genome sequences on the Internet. Yet even Haussler sometimes runs into one of the typical problems with trying to gain access to stored data—the fact that the people collecting the data didn’t take such sharing into account when they created their patient consent forms. Different studies obtained different sets of permissions from patients, and these agreements can impose unexpected limits on follow-on research. If Haussler would like to use data deposited in the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) at the National Center for Biotechnology Information, just writing the request can be a challenge. “One of the big problems with the dbGaP database is that everybody just wrote their own consent [form] from scratch. Nobody talked to anybody else about that,” Haussler says. “If I want to analyze 50 different datasets in the dbGaP, I have to tailor my request to fit the different consent forms. And I have to navigate this unbelievably byzantine set of different requirements.” Getting consent from subjects so that their information can be used by other researchers is only one of the challenges involved in sharing data for clinical cancer research. Data sharing requires guarantees of privacy and data security. There are also questions of whether data generated by one laboratory are comparable with those from another. And there’s concern among some researchers that making their results freely available will allow others to get credit for work they haven’t done. There are even questions about who should hold patient data and the practical ways of making it accessible to others. These concerns are surfacing because many people see a lot of potential in sharing, both for advancing scientific knowledge and aiding current cancer patients. Understanding rare genetic variations that contribute to cancer requires a bigger collection of samples than any one study is likely to generate, and being able to compare rare variants can help researchers determine whether or not they’re disease-causing. Widespread access to information can get patients into clinical trials faster and help inform doctors’ decisions on how to treat someone. And having access to other researchers’ results can both aid in validating previous studies and in generating hypotheses for new ones. Indeed, former Vice President Joe Biden has called for increased data sharing as part of his Cancer Moonshot, an effort to double progress in the fight against cancer over the next five years. His report to the president, released in mid-October, cites “a lack of open access and rapid sharing of research data and results allowing researchers to build on each other’s successes—and failures—to make new discoveries faster,” and calls for international standardization for truly global sharing. In one attempt at standardization (Table 1) , the GA4GH is developing templates for consent forms. The idea is to lay out a number of categories and types of consent that will be broadly applicable to individual research projects and also allow the data to be shared with other researchers. Such templates, Haussler hopes, could make access to and analysis of datasets less complicated.Table 1Acronyms for Data Sharing Projects and GroupsAcronymFull NameWhat is it?CEDARCenter for Expanded Data Annotation and RetrievalA Stanford University center sponsored by the National Institutes of Health’s Big Data to Knowledge Initiative.

Here are some of them decoded. Open table in a new tab The abundance of data sharing projects and associated groups also means an abundance of acronyms. Here are some of them decoded. William Dalton, director of the Moffitt Cancer Center’s Personalized Medicine Institute and former CEO of MCC, was thinking along those lines when he launched the Total Cancer Care project 11 years ago. When he enrolled patients, he asked for permission to follow them throughout their lifetime, collecting their clinical data, along with blood samples, tissue from their tumors, and normal tissue. The patients also granted permission to be contacted again in the future if researchers had questions or felt they could fit into a new clinical trial. That project evolved into the Oncology Research Information Exchange Network (ORIEN) that now includes 13 cancer centers. The network has gathered data from more than 130,000 patients, all using the same standards for acquiring and sharing data and the same consent form. This, Dalton explains, allows the researchers to expand far beyond the number of samples that any one cancer center can acquire, making it easier to find rare genetic variations. The numbers required are large—a 2014 Broad Institute study published in Nature estimated that to find genes that drive cancer in 2% or more of patients, it is necessary to study approximately 100,000 tumors. “Making data available is more than just taking the data and throwing it over the wall.”Armed with this collection of data, ORIEN researchers can search for patients who might be eligible for a clinical trial. If a pharmaceutical company approaches ORIEN researchers with their criteria for a trial, it’s easy to search the database for people who match. “We’ve done this,” says Michael Caligiuri, director of the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, who cofounded ORIEN with Dalton. “We’ve whittled down from 2,000 patients to ‘here’s the 144 patients that fit your trial.’ Boom. Done.” That predictive ability not only makes the trials more efficient, potentially getting a new therapy to patients faster; it also helps those patients get into the trial sooner, which is particularly important for people with pancreatic or gastric cancer who might only live a few months. “It shortened the period of assessment by weeks,” Dalton says. Each institution in ORIEN is responsible for taking care of its own patients’ data, sharing only de-identified information with other researchers. They can, however, share it with any other researchers they’d like outside of the network, subject to a peer-reviewed application process. Pharmaceutical companies can purchase subscriptions allowing them to access the data, and ORIEN is developing a uniform contract for such subscriptions. When that’s in place, Caligiuri says, it should shave a few months off the process of setting up trials. By contrast, the focus of the American Association for Cancer Research’s data sharing project is aimed not at recruiting people into clinical trials, but at aiding research. The first data release from its Genomics, Evidence, Neoplasia, Information, Exchange (GENIE) project contains clinical and genomic information from nearly 20,000 patients from eight research centers. The centers test patients for known genetic mutations for which there are existing therapies, but they also sequence many other genes that may have mutations for which currently there is no known treatment, says Charles Sawyers, chair of the human oncology and pathogenesis program at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York and chair of the project’s steering committee. “We measure them because we think they’re interesting, but we don’t know what they are going to tell us.” It’s possible, of course, that the sharing will also help in clinical decision-making, and it might help research centers find trial participants, but GENIE itself does not have consent to re-contact patients, so unlike ORIEN, GENIE will not be able to perform follow-up analyses based on new clinical data. An important facet of GENIE is that all member institutions have agreed to a common dictionary so that they all refer to the same conditions and measurements in the same terms to avoid, for instance, calling the same cancer by two different names. That kind of effort, ensuring that data from different sources lines up so that they can be compared—knowing, for instance, that one researcher reporting a variant is talking about the same thing as a different researcher—is critical to the success of data sharing. “Often, people don’t even report the most trivial things, like what the allele fraction was in a particular sample,” says Louis Staudt, director of the Center for Cancer Genomics at the National Cancer Institute. For example, he says, two studies may identify a tumor as being positive for the KRAS gene, but if one has an allele frequency of 40 or 50 percent, that could mean something very different than one of only 5 or 10 percent. Staudt is one of the leaders of the Genomic Data Commons, a $20 million NCI project at the University of Chicago designed to store and share genomic and clinical data from thousands of cancer patients. The GDC, which launched in June, already contains more than 2 petabytes of data—a petabyte is 1 million gigabytes—and should easily reach 3 PB in the coming year, Staudt says. It contains data from large NCI-funded programs such as The Cancer Genome Atlas and TARGET. In addition to making those datasets more widely available, Staudt says, “We thought, if we made a simple-enough and useful-enough system, people could also upload their own cancer genetic data that they’ve gotten funded however from anywhere in the world.” To standardize data from those disparate sources, the GDC runs them through a common set of analytic pipelines—sets of algorithms used to analyze the data—so that the data can be directly compared, and the GDC aligns them with the latest reference genome. It also requires users to label their data in a standard way. “We do force people to put all of their clinical fields into a defined vocabulary,” Staudt says. Databases the size of the GDC bring logistical challenges. It would take more than three weeks to download The Cancer Genome Atlas alone. Given that, as well as concerns about which institution and which countries have possession, it’s likely that the data won’t be moved around in large chunks. For now, Staudt says, researchers will browse the data looking for the cancer types or genes or variants that interest them, then download only a small fraction of the entire dataset. Eventually, researchers will probably have their own analysis software, which they will send to the database to run computations on the same system that stores the data, Staudt says. Agreeing on the significance of data can also be a challenge. Heidi Rehm, medical director of the clinical research sequencing platform at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, MA, and laboratory director of the Laboratory for Molecular Medicine at Partners Personalized Medicine, helped develop standard formats for depositing data into ClinVar, an archive that collects information about genetic variation that is clinically relevant in any disease. Whenever a researcher submits variants to ClinVar, people at the archive examine the data to make sure it follows standard nomenclature and can be mapped to the human genome reference sequence. The variants in ClinVar and its sister database, ClinGen, are usually labeled by the researchers who identify them as benign or likely benign, likely to cause disease, or of unknown clinical significance. Rehm and her colleagues found that 11 percent of the nearly 120,000 unique variants in ClinGen had been interpreted by more than one laboratory, and of those, nearly 2,300 had their clinical significance interpreted differently by different labs, sometimes with one researcher labeling the variant benign while another called it pathenogenic. To deal with such disagreements, ClinVar implemented a star-rating system to label how confident researchers are of a particular variant’s pathogenicity. Some of those differences are due to what was known at the time the variant was reported. “The standards to interpret variants a long time ago were very different,” Rehm says. “The literature is rife with false assertions of pathogenicity.” Part of the solution is not to simply accept the claim about the variant, but to take the evidence gathered from individual experiments and compare it to the rest of the database. But Rehm believes that people need to accept that, even if clinicians are uncertain about the significance of a variant, they can still act on what they do know. “It is professional opinion that guides a lot of medicine,” she points out. “Two different people looking at the exact same data can have a different opinion about the certainty. It’s okay to have disagreements if you’re all looking at the same evidence.” Not only does the biological information from different sources have to be comparable, but the ways it’s labeled for the computer have to agree as well. Mark Musen, a professor of biomedical informatics at Stanford University, runs the Center for Expanded Data Annotation and Retrieval (CEDAR), which is supported by the NIH’s Big Data to Knowledge Initiative. CEDAR is building a library of templates to guide researchers through the often tedious process of creating metadata, the set of labels and descriptors that allow computers to search through a database and find, for example, all of the data relating to a particular gene or a particular type of cancer. That sounds simple enough, but the process can be derailed by anything from typos to using different spellings for the same units—milliliter versus mL, for example. Musen says, “It just boggles the mind that there are so many different ways of describing the same thing.” CEDAR’s goal is to provide standards and aids that avoid such confusion. “Making data available is more than just taking the data and throwing it over the wall,” Musen says. While NIH guidelines require researchers to share data, journals are also encouraging the practice by requiring the data behind papers to be made available, sometimes in specific databases. Rehm, who is an editor at Cold Spring Harbor Molecular Case Studies, persuaded that journal to require that variant data be deposited in ClinVar, and she’s talking to other journals about doing the same. Like many journals, MCS also requires sequencing and phenome information to be deposited in appropriate databases. In January, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors proposed that its members require researchers to share patient data within six months of publishing a paper based on that data. That’s in line with the GDC’s time frame, although Staudt says in practice, the process of applying for access to the data will means it will probably be a year before others can use them. Jeffrey Drazen, editor-in-chief of the New England Journal of Medicine and a member of ICMJE, says his journal will adopt the requirement once there is a network in place for doing that sort of sharing. Some researchers, though, have expressed resistance to sharing data, at least quickly, out of fear of what some call “research parasites”—people who profit off others’ work by running analyses of their datasets and writing papers about them. In August, a group of 282 investigators calling itself the International Consortium of Investigators for Fairness in Trial Data Sharing published a commentary in NEJM calling on the ICMJE to allow exclusive use of data for at least two years. They argue that one of the incentives for researchers to participate in large, multi-center trials is the opportunity to write secondary papers based on those trials and that making the data available too quickly would put those researchers in competition with others who didn’t contribute to the research, thus reducing the incentive. The requirement might also lead some people to delay publishing their first paper until they had time to write follow-up papers, the group said. Drazen agrees that there may need to be changes in the incentives that drive researchers. That’s something the research community still needs to work out, he says. Staudt says that having access to shared data makes everyone’s work more productive. “No one lab can generate all the gene expression data they need to fully understand their own data,” Staudt says. “This kind of sharing has accelerated research, I would argue, and it’s the right thing to do because the primary goal is to help people with cancer.” Sawyers doesn’t believe that generating papers from other people’s data in GENIE will be much of an issue. He also thinks objections to sharing data are fading as people come to understand how much it can advance science. “The further along we get, the less resistance there is to making it available.” Moffitt’s Dalton says it’s important to keep in mind the reasons for sharing data in the first place. “Sometimes, we lose sight and think of data sharing as the end point. That’s not the end point, in my opinion,” he says. Rather, the point is to create scientific collaborations that have the resources to advance science so that it can aid in the fight against cancer for individual patients and benefit society as a whole."

https://openalex.org/W2587677636,"Background & aims Red blood cell (RBC) indices have been demonstrated to be associated with fatty liver disease (FLD) and metabolic syndrome. However, controversy exists regarding the relationship of RBC indices with FLD to date and few has focused on RBC count. This study aimed to explore the association between RBC count and risk of FLD in Southern Chinese adults. Methods A hospital-based cross-sectional study was performed in two hospital health examination centers, including information on ultrasonography-diagnosed FLD, anthropometric indices and biochemical measurements. Covariance analysis was used to evaluate group differences. After quintile classification of RBC counts, logistic regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the odds ratios (ORs) of FLD. Results This study consisted of 8618 subjects (4137 men and 4481 women) aged between 20 and 89 years. FLD cases had higher RBC counts than non-FLD cases in both genders (P<0.001). The prevalence rates of FLD increased with the RBC quintiles in both genders (all P trend<0.001), and were higher in men than women. Binary logistic regression analysis showed positive association between RBC count and FLD, and the OR (95% confidence interval (CI)) were 2.56 (2.06–3.18) in men and 3.69 (2.74–4.98) in women, respectively, when comparing Q5 with Q1. Stratified analyses showed similar trends among subjects with and without FLD risk factors. Gender independent results were similar to gender dependent results. Conclusions Elevated RBC count is independently associated with high risk of FLD, suggesting that the RBC count may be a potential risk predictor for FLD."
https://openalex.org/W2587636832,"I think that it is our intention to deny cancer any control over us. —Elizabeth Edwards (interviewed on 60 Minutes) “And now here it was again, now grown, now in its new home.” In her book Resilience, Elizabeth Edwards recalls what raced through her mind when she learned that her cancer had come back and had metastasized. After surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, she thought that the cancer “had been chased away.” How does cancer find a new home and become metastatic? The short answer is simple: it is complicated. As cancer forms and develops, some cancer cells manage to be disseminated from the primary tumor, travel through the circulatory system, and infiltrate and colonize distant organs, eventually forming clinically detectable metastasis. Given the complexity of the metastatic process and technical and experimental bottlenecks, systematically investigating metastasis has been challenging, and to this date, metastatic cancer also remains largely incurable and fatal. Nevertheless, with the availability of more pathophysiologically relevant disease models and technological advances in areas such as imaging and single-cell sequencing, recent studies are beginning to paint a clearer picture. Why does cancer come back as metastatic in some patients after the primary tumor has been successfully removed? The answer might have to do with the timing of metastatic dissemination. Earlier data from several tumor types already suggest that, contrary to more conventional thinking, dissemination can occur rather early during cancer development, but the mechanism of early dissemination is unknown. A pair of studies now offers important clues as to how this happens in breast cancer (Hosseini et al., 2016Hosseini H. Obradović M.M. Hoffmann M. Harper K.L. Sosa M.S. Werner-Klein M. Nanduri L.K. Werno C. Ehrl C. Maneck M. et al.Nature. 2016; (Published online December 14, 2016)https://doi.org/10.1038/nature20785Crossref Scopus (416) Google Scholar, Harper et al., 2016Harper K.L. Sosa M.S. Entenberg D. Hosseini H. Cheung J.F. Nobre R. Avivar-Valderas A. Nagi C. Girnius N. Davis R.J. et al.Nature. 2016; (Published online December 14, 2016)https://doi.org/10.1038/nature20609Crossref Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Using a Her2-driven breast cancer mouse model, Housseini et al. and Harper et al. provide evidence not only that cancer cells disseminate very early, before detectable primary tumor formation, but also that early disseminated cancer cells (eDCCs) have more migration, invasion, and metastasis-initiating capacities (but not more tumor-initiating capacity) than DCCs from primary tumors at a later stage. Both studies also indicate a critical early involvement of HER2 in the dissemination of eDCCs, before its proliferation-promoting role after the primary tumor has formed. Collectively, these new findings have significant implications and suggest that metastasis might be preventable if a targetable Achilles’ heel in eDCCs can be identified. Among the many steps toward clinical manifestation of metastasis, organ colonization is perhaps the most rate-limiting one given that most arriving cancer cells don’t survive the new organ’s microenvironment and of the few that do, some might enter a state of dormancy. By definition, metastasis-initiating cells (MICs) are tumor cells with the capability to seed secondary tumors in distant organs. Two new studies dissect the mechanism of metastatic colonization from different angles. In one study, Pascual et al. set out to ask if there exists a small population of MICs within tumor-initiating cells (TICs) that can drive metastasis in oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs) (Pascual et al., 2017Pascual G. Avgustinova A. Mejetta S. Martín M. Castellanos A. Attolini C.S. Berenguer A. Prats N. Toll A. Hueto J.A. et al.Nature. 2017; 541: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Using CD44 as a TIC marker, they identify a subpopulation of CD44bright cells that are marked by high-level expression of genes associated with lipid metabolism and metastasis. Among the product of those genes is CD36, a cell-surface fatty acid receptor responsible for lipid uptake to provide ATP energy via fatty acid β-oxidation. Pascual et al. show that CD36 is required for OSCC metastasis to lymph nodes but has only a slight effect on primary tumor growth. Feeding mice with a high-fat diet or exposing OSCC cells to palmitic acid, a dietary fatty acid recognized by CD36, also promotes CD36-dependent lymph node metastasis. Importantly, orthotopic inoculation of limiting dilution experiments demonstrates that CD36+CD44bright cells are metastasis initiating. In a separate study, van der Weyden et al. use a tour de force approach to look for contributing factors from the host microenvironment (van der Weyden et al., 2017van der Weyden L. Arends M.J. Campbell A.D. Bald T. Wardle-Jones H. Griggs N. Velasco-Herrera M.D. Tüting T. Sansom O.J. Karp N.A. et al.Sanger Mouse Genetics ProjectNature. 2017; 541: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The authors screened 810 mutant mouse lines by using an experimental metastasis assay and identified 23 genes as potential host regulators of metastatic colonization, many of which have not been previously implicated in metastasis. Interestingly, mice deficient in the sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) transporter spinster homolog 2 (Spns2) show the greatest metastatic suppression. S1P is a bioactive lysophospholipid mediator that has been linked to lymphocyte trafficking. van der Weyden et al. now report that global or lymphatic endothelial cell-specific deletion of Spns2 reduces melanoma or colorectal cancer metastasis to the lung by retaining more anti-tumor effector T cells and natural killer cells in the lung. As proof of principle, Pascual et al. and van der Weyden et al. also provide in vivo evidence that CD36 and the SIP1-SPNS2 axis could be explored as potential drug targets for anti-metastasis therapy. In the case of CD36, administration of a CD36-neutralizing antibody in an immunocompetent orthotopic mouse model of OSCC induces strong metastatic inhibition, and in some cases, complete regression of lymph node and lung metastases, without toxicity. Although it is still too early to conclude whether targeting CD36 or SPNS2 might be a clinically viable strategy, these two studies shed new light on the thus far underexplored roles of lipids in metastasis. Future studies of lipids, a diversified group of molecules with a multitude of biological and physiological functions, might reveal ways in which metastasis will be losing its control."
