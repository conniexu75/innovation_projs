https://openalex.org/W1488935046,"The profound influence of glucocorticoid hormones on the inflammatory response includes a rapid and significant reduction in the synthesis of cyclooxygenase (prostaglandin G/H synthase, PGHS), the key enzyme for prostaglandin biosynthesis. In analyzing the glucocorticoid effects on PGHS synthesis in C127 mouse fibroblasts, we detected a novel 4-kilobase (kb) mRNA that is related to a PGHS cDNA cloned from an ovine seminal vesicle library. This RNA is much more prevalent in cycloheximide-treated cells and, based on stringency analysis and preliminary sequence data, arises from a gene distinct from that transcribed into the previously cloned 2.8-kb PGHS cDNA. Furthermore, the 4-kb mRNA encodes a 70-kDa protein that is specifically immunoprecipitated by anti-PGHS serum. The abundance of the 4-kb mRNA is strongly decreased by dexamethasone and increased by serum within 2 h whereas the 2.8-kb PGHS mRNA, which is also seen in these cells, does not consistently change. These changes in the level of the 4-kb mRNA with serum and dexamethasone treatment parallel changes in the level of synthesized PGHS protein detected in both metabolically labeled cells and in in vitro translated mRNAs. This discovery of a cyclooxygenase-related gene that is transcriptionally regulated by serum and glucocorticoid hormones in a manner identical to that reported for cyclooxygenase activity may help clarify issues regarding cyclooxygenase regulation and suggests that two distinct and differentially regulated cyclooxygenase species exist."
https://openalex.org/W2140566131,"The c-myc gene encodes a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein (c-Myc) that forms leucine zipper complexes and can act as a transcription factor. Growth factor stimulation of cells causes the phosphorylation of the c-Myc transcriptional activation domain at Ser62 within a proline-rich region that is highly conserved among members of the Myc family (Alvarez, E., Northwood, I.C., Gonzalez, F. A., Latour, D. A., Seth, A., Abate, C., Curran, T., and Davis, R. J. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 15277-15285). This phosphorylation site is a substrate for growth factor-regulated MAP kinases and for the cell cycle-dependent protein kinase p34cdc2. We report that serum treatment of cells results in a marked increase in the transactivation of gene expression mediated by the c-Myc transcriptional activation domain. A point mutation at the site of growth factor-stimulated phosphorylation (Ser62) decreases the serum induction of transactivation. These data indicate that the c-Myc transcriptional activation domain may be a direct target of signal transduction pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1522904635,"Exposure to ethanol for several days increases the number and function of dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channels in excitable tissues. In the neural cell line PC12, this process is blocked by inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC), suggesting that PKC mediates ethanol-induced increases in Ca2+ channels. We report that treatment with 25-200 mM ethanol for 2-8 days increased PKC activity in PC12 cells and NG108-15 neuroblastoma-glioma cells. Detailed studies in PC12 cells showed that ethanol also increased phorbol ester binding and immunoreactivity to PKC delta and PKC epsilon. These changes were associated with increased PKC-mediated phosphorylation. Ethanol did not activate the enzyme directly, nor did ethanol increase levels of diacylglycerol. Ethanol-induced increases in PKC levels may promote up-regulation of Ca2+ channels, and may also regulate the expression and function of other proteins involved in cellular adaptation to ethanol."
https://openalex.org/W1490691079,"Damaged or old erythrocytes are cleared rapidly from circulation. Because several common biochemical lesions can induce the clustering of integral membrane proteins, we have proposed that formation of microscopic protein aggregates in the membrane might constitute a cell surface marker that promotes removal of the defective/senescent cells. We demonstrate here that treatments that cluster integral membrane proteins in erythrocytes (1 mM ZnCl2, 1 mM acridine orange, and 0.35 microM melittin) induce autologous IgG binding, complement fixation, and phagocytosis by human monocytes in vitro. Removal of the clustering agents prior to incubation in autologous serum or cross-linking of cell surface proteins before addition of clustering agents prohibited the above response, while cross-linking after treatment with the clustering agents preserved the response even if the clustering agents were later removed. Furthermore, subsequent reversal of the chemical cross-link maintaining the clustered distribution also reversed the induction of IgG binding, complement deposition, and phagocytosis. Finally, by deleting or inactivating different steps in the phagocytosis pathway, the chronology of steps was shown to be: (i) integral protein clustering, (ii) IgG binding, (iii) complement deposition, and (iv) phagocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1504348021,"Cultured bovine aortic smooth muscle (BASM) and endothelial (BAE) cells, like articular chondrocytes, synthesize two populations of small chondroitin/dermatan sulfate (CS/DS) proteoglycans (PGs) of similar size as PG-I/biglycan and PG-II/decorin. However, Northern blot analyses demonstrated that BAE cells express detectable amounts of mRNA transcripts only for PG-I/biglycan, whereas BASM cells and articular chondrocytes express mRNA transcripts for both PG-I/biglycan and PG-II/decorin. Endothelial cells from human umbilical vein also expressed detectable amounts of mRNA transcripts only for PG-I/biglycan, and not PG-II/decorin. Antiserum raised against bovine PG-II/decorin immunoprecipitated an apparent single PG species with relative molecular mass (Mr) of approximately 120,000-180,000 from BASM cell and articular chondrocyte cultures but failed to immunoprecipitate an equivalent PG species from BAE cell cultures, consistent with the results from Northern blot analysis. In contrast, immunoprecipitations by antisera to PG-I/biglycan indicated that cultured endothelial cells synthesize two forms of PG-I/biglycan with Mr values slightly larger than 200,000 and 120,000-140,000. It is likely, based on the magnitude of the size difference, that these two forms of PG-I/biglycan differ in the number of glycosaminoglycan chains. Additionally, BASM but not BAE cells were found to express detectable amounts of mRNA transcripts for type I collagen. The above results indicate that the two main cell types of the vascular wall, endothelial and smooth muscle cells, express different sets of small interstitial CS/DS PGs and that the synthesis of PG-II/decorin by these cells correlates with the expression of type I collagen, a collagen known to interact specifically with this PG. These differences in the expression of extracellular matrix molecules may be important in regulating the cell type-specific functions of endothelial and smooth muscle cells within the vascular tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1576713809,"The lipopeptidophosphoglycan is the major cell surface glycoconjugate of the epimastigote forms of the parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. A detailed partial structure for this molecule has been reported (Previato, J. O., Gorin, P. A. J., Mazurek, M., Xavier, M. T., Fournet, B., Wieruszesk, J. M., and Mendonca-Previato, L. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 2518-2526). In this study, we complete the primary structure assignments and describe the microheterogeneity found in the lipopeptidophosphoglycan glycan, using a combination of 1H and 31P NMR, fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, methylation linkage analysis, and exoglycosidase sequencing. The lipopeptidophosphoglycan is a glycosylated inositol-phosphoceramide with striking homology to glycosylphosphatidylinositol membrane anchors found attached to a wide variety of plasma membrane proteins throughout the eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W1564087065,"Integrin heterodimers which share a common beta 1 subunit are the major cellular receptors for many extracellular matrix proteins. Here, we show that two inflammatory mediators, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), can regulate the expression of the alpha 1 beta 1 integrin heterodimer, known to be a laminin and collagen receptor. In human skin fibroblasts 10 units/ml IL-1 beta increase the biosynthesis of the alpha 1 integrin subunit an average of 4.5-fold. Furthermore, IL-1 beta can turn on alpha 1 subunit expression in MG-63 human osteosarcoma cells even in conditions where the untreated MG-63 cells do not express it in detectable amounts. The effect of TNF-alpha on alpha 1 subunit expression is similar. Both IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha increased MG-63 cell adhesion on laminin. The effect of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) on integrin expression in MG-63 cells has been previously described (Heino, J., and Massague, J. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 21806-21811). TGF-beta 1 decreases the biosynthesis of alpha 3 subunit but increases the production of alpha 2 subunit. IL-1 beta potentiates the effects of TGF-beta 1. Furthermore, in the presence of TGF-beta 1 the increase in the expression of alpha 1 subunit by IL-1 beta is even larger. Thus, IL-1 beta and TGF-beta 1, which usually have antagonistic functions in connective tissue, can regulate integrin expression in a synergistic way."
https://openalex.org/W1550445291,"We have obtained evidence that selective inhibition of high affinity thrombin-binding sites located in the amino-terminal domain of the membrane glycoprotein (GP) Ib alpha results in impaired platelet activation, as shown by abrogation or reduction of the following responses induced in normal platelets by exposure to less than 1 nM alpha-thrombin: (i) increase in intracellular ionized calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i), (ii) release of dense granule content, (iii) binding of fibrinogen, (iv) aggregation. An anti-GP Ib monoclonal antibody, LJ-Ib 10, which does not inhibit von Willebrand factor binding to platelets, obliterated the high affinity alpha-thrombin-binding sites on normal platelets. Isotherms of alpha-thrombin binding to normal platelets treated with saturating amounts of the antibody were virtually identical to those obtained with platelets from a patient with classical Bernard-Soulier syndrome. In parallel with decreased binding of the agonist, this antibody caused 50% inhibition of the maximal extent of platelet aggregation and 90% inhibition of ATP release induced by 0.3 nM alpha-thrombin. By inhibiting alpha-thrombin binding to GP Ib, the antibody prevented the activation of platelets exposed to low concentrations of the agonist, as demonstrated by abrogation of the increase in intraplatelet ionized calcium concentration induced in control platelets by 0.18 nM alpha-thrombin; under these conditions, fibrinogen binding was inhibited by 84%. Therefore, there is a correlation between occupancy of the high affinity sites for alpha-thrombin on GP Ib alpha and platelet activation, secretion, and aggregation, suggesting that GP Ib alpha is part of an alpha-thrombin receptor relevant for platelet function."
https://openalex.org/W1536880037,"Ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs) are a widely distributed family of plant enzymes that are remarkably potent catalytic inactivators of eukaryotic protein synthesis. All RIPs described to date, including the A-chain of the plant cytotoxin ricin, are polypeptides of 25-32 kDa and share significant amino acid sequence homologies. We have characterized and cloned an RIP from maize (Zea mays). In contrast to previously described RIPs, we have found that maize RIP is synthesized and stored in the kernel as a 34-kDa inactive precursor (isoelectric point = 6.5). During germination, this neutral precursor is converted into a basic, active form (isoelectric point greater than 9) by limited proteolysis, which removes 25 amino acids (2.8 kDa) of net charge -6 from the center of the polypeptide chain. Additional processing also occurs at the amino and carboxyl termini of the polypeptide. The sequence of the internal processed region is unique and it is equivalent to an insertion centered around Thr-156 in the amino acid sequence of ricin toxin A-chain, i.e. in the center of the enzymatically active domain. The generation of an active enzyme by removal of a large amino acid segment from the middle of a precursor polypeptide chain represents a novel mechanism of proenzyme activation that is distinct from more conventional activation mechanisms involving NH2-terminal proteolytic processing. A two-chain active RIP (comprised of 16.5- and 8.5-kDa fragments that remain tightly associated) is produced from this processing event."
https://openalex.org/W1678773327,"GH4C1 cells, which express Ca(2+)-dependent alpha- and beta- as well as Ca(2+)-independent gamma-, epsilon- and zeta-protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes, provide a cell culture model for studying isozyme-specific properties and functions. Hormonal activation of PKCs regulates the differentiated functions of these cells, namely secretion and synthesis of prolactin (PRL). We previously reported that thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) selectively down-modulates epsilon-PKC with no effect on alpha- or beta-PKCs (Kiley, S.C., Schaap, D., Parker, P., Hsieh, L.-L., and Jaken, S. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 15704-15712). We now extend those studies to explore the relationship between TRH-stimulated diacylglycerol (DAG) levels and epsilon-PKC down-modulation. TRH stimulates three distinct DAG phases in GH cells. Phase 1 DAG peaks at 15 s, is accompanied by a 6-fold increase in intracellular Ca2+, and causes the redistribution of alpha-, beta-, delta, and epsilon-PKC isozymes from a soluble to a detergent-insoluble particulate compartment. Phase 2 DAG peaks at 10 min, is not associated with a Ca2+ signal, and does not activate PKC by any criteria tested. Phase 3 DAG peaks at 6 h and is sustained through 12 h. This novel DAG phase is not associated with increased intracellular Ca2+. The time course of phase 3 DAG formation corresponds to the time course of TRH-stimulated epsilon-PKC down-regulation; maximal effects are observed at 6-12 h for both events. Unlike alpha-, beta-, and delta-PKCs which are preferentially distributed in the soluble fraction of resting GH cells, epsilon-PKC is also distributed in the detergent-insoluble particulate fraction. The selective compartmentalization of epsilon-PKC in the particulate fraction may render this pool uniquely susceptible to proteolytic degradation. The time course of phase 3 DAG formation and epsilon-PKC down-modulation corresponds to the time course of decreasing PRL message synthesis in GH4 cells. The data suggests that loss of epsilon-PKC may be associated with the down-regulation of prolactin synthesis and that regulation of PRL gene transcription may be an epsilon-PKC-specific function in GH cells."
https://openalex.org/W1522388412,"It has been proposed that the carboxyl terminus of the smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase is expressed as an independent protein. This protein has been purified from tissues and named telokin (Ito, M., Dabrowska, R., Guerriero, V., Jr., and Hartshorne, D. J. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 13971-13974). In this study we have isolated and characterized cDNA and genomic clones encoding telokin. Analysis of a genomic DNA clone suggests that the mRNA encoding telokin arises from a promoter which appears to be located within an intron of the smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) gene. This intron interrupts exons encoding the calmodulin binding domain of the kinase. The amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA predicts that telokin is identical to the carboxyl-terminal 155 residues of the smooth muscle MLCK. Unlike the smooth muscle MLCK which is expressed in both smooth and non-muscle tissues, telokin is expressed in some smooth muscle tissues but has not been detected in aortic smooth muscle or in any non-muscle tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1599005607,"To characterize the structure of the agonist-binding site of the Torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR), we have used [3H]acetylcholine mustard [( 3H]AChM), a reactive analog of acetylcholine, to identify residues contributing to the cation-binding subsite. Reaction of [3H]AChM, in its aziridinium form, with AChR-rich membrane suspensions, resulted initially in reversible, high affinity binding (K approximately 0.3 microM) followed by slow alkylation of the acetylcholine-binding site. Incorporation of label into AChR alpha-subunit was inhibited by agonists and competitive antagonists, but not by noncompetitive antagonists, and reaction with 3 microM [3H]AChM for 2 h resulted in specific alkylation of 0.6% of alpha-subunits. Within the alpha-subunit, greater than 90% of specific incorporation was contained within an 18-kDa Staphylococcus aureus V8 proteolytic fragment beginning at Val-46 and containing N-linked carbohydrate. To identify sites of specific alkylation, [3H]AChM-labeled alpha-subunit was digested with trypsin, and the digests were fractionated by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Specifically labeled material was recovered within a single peak containing a peptide extending from Leu-80 to Lys-107. NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing revealed specific release of 3H in cycle 14 corresponding to alpha-subunit Tyr-93. Identification of Tyr-93 as the site of alkylation was confirmed by radiosequence analysis utilizing o-phthalaldehyde to establish that the released 3H originated from a peptide containing prolines at residues 2 and 9. Because [3H]AChM contains as its reactive group a positively charged quaternary aziridinium, alpha-subunit Tyr-93 is identified as contributing to the cation-binding domain of the AChR agonist-binding site. The selective reaction of [3H]AChM with tyrosyl rather than acidic side chains indicates the importance of aromatic interactions for the binding of the quaternary ammonium group, and the lack of reaction with the tyrosyl or acidic side chains within alpha 190-200 emphasizes the selective orientation of acetylcholine within its binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1517190750,"Infection by influenza virus is initiated by a cellular adhesion event that is mediated by the viral protein, hemagglutinin, which is exposed on the surface of the virion. Hemagglutinin recognizes and binds to cell surface sialic acid residues. Although each individual ligand binding interaction is weak, the high affinity of influenza virus for cells that bear sialic acid residues is thought to result from a multivalent attachment process involving many similar recognition events. To evaluate such binding we have synthesized three series of compounds, each containing two sialic acid residues separated by spacers of different length, and have tested them as ligands for influenza hemagglutinin. No increased binding to the bromelain-released hemagglutinin ectodomain was seen for any of the bivalent compounds as determined by 1H NMR titration. In contrast, however, a spacer length between sialic acid residues of approximately 55 A sharply increases the binding of these bidentate species to whole virus as determined by hemagglutination inhibition assays. The most effective compound containing glycines in the linking chain displayed 100-fold increased affinity for whole virus over the paradigm monovalent ligand, Neu5Ac alpha 2Me."
https://openalex.org/W1589868959,"A mini-gene version of the human gene for a pro-alpha 1(I) chain of type I procollagen (COL1A1) was prepared that contained -2.5 kilobases of the promoter region and the 5'- and 3'-ends of the gene but lacked a large central region containing 41 exons. The construct was modeled after a sporadic in-frame deletion of the human gene that produced a lethal variant of osteogenesis imperfecta, because it caused synthesis of shortened pro-alpha 1(I) chains that associated with normal pro-alpha 1(I) and pro-alpha 2(I) chains and caused degradation of both the shortened and normal pro-alpha chains through a process called procollagen suicide. The mini-gene was used to prepare transgenic mice. Eight of 15 transgenic mice expressed varying levels of the gene. All except one of the Fo founders were phenotypically normal, but several of the founders were apparently mosaic since they produced F1 progeny that died shortly after birth with a distinctive phenotype. The phenotype included extensive fractures of ribs and long bones similar to the fractures seen in lethal variants of osteogenesis imperfecta. Mice with the lethal phenotype expressed much higher levels of the mini-gene than transgenic mice without the lethal phenotype. Experiments with cultured skin fibroblasts from the transgenic mice demonstrated that shortened pro-alpha 1(I) chains synthesized from the mini-gene became disulfide-linked to pro-alpha 1(I) chains synthesized from the endogenous mouse gene. The results demonstrate that a mutated type I procollagen gene based on the model of procollagen suicide can be used to produce a severe phenotype of osteogenesis imperfecta that is genetically transmitted."
https://openalex.org/W1531773820,"Sertoli cells are hormonally regulated by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) acting upon a G-protein-linked cell surface FSH receptor. FSH increases intracellular cyclic AMP but the involvement of other signal transduction mechanisms including intracellular calcium in FSH action are not proven. Using freshly isolated rat Sertoli cells we measured cytosolic free ionized calcium levels by dual-wavelength fluorescence spectrophotometry using the calcium-sensitive fluorescent dye Fura2-AM. The cytosolic calcium concentration in unstimulated Sertoli cells was 89 +/- 2 nM (n = 151 experiments) and was markedly increased by either calcium channel ionophores (ionomycin, Bay K8644) or plasma membrane depolarization consistent with the presence of voltage-sensitive and -independent calcium channel in Sertoli cell membranes. Ovine FSH stimulated a specific, sensitive (ED50, 5.0 ng of S-16/ml), and dose-dependent (maximal at 20 ng/ml) rise in cytosolic calcium commencing within 60 s to reach levels of 192 +/- 31 nM after 180 s and lasting for at least 10 min. The effect of FSH was replicated by forskolin, cholera toxin, and dibutyryl cyclic AMP, suggesting that cyclic AMP may mediate the FSH-induced rise in cytosolic calcium. The FSH-induced rise in cytosolic calcium required extracellular calcium and was abolished by calcium channel blockers specific for dihydropyridine (verapamil, nicardipine), nonvoltage-gated (ruthenium red) or all calcium channels (cobalt). Thus FSH action on Sertoli cells involves a specific, rapid, and sustained increase in cytosolic calcium which requires extracellular calcium and involves both dihydropyridine-sensitive, voltage-gated calcium channels and voltage-independent, receptor-gated calcium channels in the plasma membranes of rat Sertoli cells. The replication by cyclic AMP of the effects of FSH suggests that calcium may be a signal-amplification or -modulating mechanism rather than an alternate primary signal transduction system for FSH in Sertoli cells."
https://openalex.org/W1544802519,"A series of cDNA clones corresponding to the 5' end of the chicken type II collagen mRNA were generated using a single-sided polymerase chain reaction technique. Analysis of these cDNAs showed that the second exon of the gene is alternatively spliced such that it is either present or absent in the mRNA. This exon encodes a 70-amino acid cysteine-rich globular domain which is present in the amino-terminal propeptides of alpha 1(I), alpha 1(III), and alpha 2(V) procollagen chains but which was previously thought to be absent from type II procollagen. Analysis of the expression of the two alternatively spliced forms of the chicken type II collagen mRNA showed that the mRNA without the second exon was the predominant form (approximately 90%) in sternal cartilage from 14-day embryos, but in precartilage limb mesenchyme only the form including the second exon was detected. This later form was also present in a number of non-cartilage tissues including embryonic calvaria, skin, heart, skeletal muscle, and brain; no type II collagen mRNA was detected in liver. Studies of developing limbs from progressive embryonic stages suggest that the appearance of the mRNA lacking the second exon is a relatively late event during chondrogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1519833951,"We have identified two isoforms of initiation factor 4A (eIF-4A) in maize root tips, with distinct isoelectric points and similar molecular mass (approximately 50 kDa). Both isoforms of maize eIF-4A cross-react with antibodies raised against wheat germ eIF-4A, and one of the maize proteins (higher pI isoform) comigrates with purified wheat germ eIF-4A on two-dimensional gels. The two maize eIF-4As were indistinguishable by comparative peptide fingerprint analysis, which also showed a very strong similarity between eIF-4A in maize roots and wheat germ. Maize eIF-4As copurify with eIF-4F and eIF-(iso)4F on a 7-methyl-GTP-Sepharose affinity column, indicating that they are part of the 5'-cap-binding complex. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting of proteins from 32P-labeled maize root tips revealed that the lower pI isoform of eIF-4A is phosphorylated. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps of trypsin-digested eIF-4A contained one principal phosphorylated fragment; phosphoamino acid analysis indicated phosphorylation of threonine. In oxygenated maize root tips, the ratio of phosphorylated to nonphosphorylated eIF-4A is approximately 0.2. This ratio increases to approximately 1 within 20 min following the onset of hypoxia, due to interconversion between the two maize eIF-4A isoforms. The hypoxia-induced phosphorylation of eIF-4A is discussed with respect to metabolic responses, and the translational control of gene expression, in hypoxic plant tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1486687385,"The active center of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase performs the principal biochemical reaction of gene expression. Using cross-linkable substrate analogs and site-directed mutations, two evolutionarily invariant amino acids in the beta subunit of the Escherichia coli enzyme (Lys1065 and His1237) were mapped close to the binding site of the priming substrate of the reaction. Surprisingly, the mutational substitution of these residues (Lys1065----Arg and His1237----Ala) did not inactivate the catalytic function, but inhibited transition from the initiation to the elongation stage of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1598903421,"Many pathogenic bacteria specifically bind to components of the extracellular matrix. In this study, we report the specific association of Staphylococcus aureus with elastin, a major structural component of elastic tissue. Competition assays in which the binding of radiolabeled tropoelastin was inhibited by excess unlabeled elastin peptides, but not by other proteins, established the specificity of the interaction. Kinetic studies showed that tropoelastin binding to the bacteria was rapid and saturable. Scatchard analysis of the equilibrium binding data indicated the presence of a single class of high affinity binding sites (KD approximately 4-7 nM) with approximately 1000 sites per organism. Protease susceptibility suggested that the elastin binding moiety on S. aureus was a protein, which was confirmed by the isolation of a 25-kDa elastin-binding protein from S. aureus extracts through affinity chromatography. Using a truncated form of tropoelastin, the bacterial binding domain on elastin was mapped to a 30-kDa fragment at the amino end of the molecule. Although the precise amino acid sequence recognized by the staphylococcal elastin receptor has not been characterized, it is clearly different from the region of tropoelastin that specifies binding to mammalian elastin receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2166030007,"We report the purification of betaglycan, a low-abundance membrane proteoglycan with high affinity for transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). Betaglycan solubilized from rat embryo membrane preparations was purified to near-homogeneity by sequential chromatography through DEAE-Trisacryl, wheat germ lectin-Sepharose, and TGF-beta 1-agarose. Purified betaglycan has properties similar to betaglycan affinity-labeled in intact cells: it binds TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2 with KD approximately 0.2 nM, contains heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains and N-linked glycans attached to a 110-kDa core protein, and can spontaneously associate with phosphatidylcholine liposomes. The betaglycan core obtained by enzymatic removal of the GAG chains has high affinity for TGF-beta and associates with artificial liposomes, indicating that the core protein binds TGF-beta and anchors to membranes independently of the GAG chains present on the native protein or of any ancillary protein."
https://openalex.org/W1563998456,"Treatment of PC12 cells with nerve growth factor does not alter the levels of B-raf mRNA, but does induce rapid phosphorylation of B-raf proteins. Phosphorylation was observed after 1.5 min and reached a maximum by 10-15 min. B-raf protein was phosphorylated almost exclusively on serine residues; no tyrosine phosphorylation was detected. Nerve growth factor-induced phosphorylation was not affected by depletion of protein kinase C or by removal of extracellular calcium but was inhibited by K-252a. Concomitant with the increase in serine phosphorylation, nerve growth factor treatment also increased the serine/threonine kinase activity of B-raf protein within 1-2 min."
https://openalex.org/W1507734204,"We previously isolated a cDNA encoding the 60-kDa murine protein (RBP-J kappa protein) that specifically binds to the immunoglobulin J kappa recombination signal sequence. The RBP-J kappa gene is highly conserved in a wide variety of organisms including man, Xenopus, Drosophila, and yeast. We have isolated and characterized the Drosophila homologue of the RBP-J kappa gene. The Drosophila RBP-J kappa gene was mapped to the polytene region 35BC of chromosome 2. The nucleotide sequence of this gene indicates that it is not one of the known genes located in the 35 BC region. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the Drosophila and mouse RBP-J kappa genes are 60 and 75% homologous, respectively. The central 248-residue regions of RBP-J kappa proteins of the two species are 93% homologous and include the 40-residue integrase motif. The Drosophila RBP-J kappa protein expressed in COS cells bound to the J kappa recognition sequence with the same specificity as the murine counterpart. These results suggest that Drosophila may have a site-specific recombination system which utilizes the immunoglobulin recombination signal sequence. Implications for evolution of immunoglobulin gene rearrangement were also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1516158605,"The effect of oleate on the subcellular distribution of protein kinase C (PKC) was studied in isolated hepatocytes and in perfused rat liver in the presence of physiological concentrations of serum albumin. A time- and dose-dependent translocation of PKC from the cytosol towards the membranes was observed at oleate concentrations that fell within the range of concentrations reached under several physiological conditions. Analysis of the membrane-bound isoenzymes of PKC by hydroxylapatite chromatography revealed that the beta isoenzyme was preferentially translocated to this compartment in hepatocytes incubated with oleate. Activation of PKC after incubation of hepatocytes with oleate involved at least three different effectors of the enzyme: the fatty acid itself, the diacylglycerol synthesized from oleate, and the rise in the cytosolic calcium concentration elicited by oleate. As a result of PKC activation, protein phosphorylation of intact hepatocytes in response to oleate exhibited an enhancement in the phosphate content of a protein of 82 kDa, similar to that phosphorylated in the presence of phorbol dibutyrate."
https://openalex.org/W1575606459,"CO dehydrogenase/acetyl-coenzyme A synthase (CODH) is the central enzyme in the pathway of acetyl-coenzyme A biosynthesis in Clostridium thermoaceticum. It catalyzes the interconversion of CO and CO2 and the synthesis of acetyl-coenzyme A from the methylated corrinoid/iron sulfur protein, CO, and coenzyme A. It is a nickel-iron-sulfur protein and contains two subunits in the form (alpha beta)3. Reported here is the cloning and sequencing of the genes for both subunits of CODH. The gene for the alpha subunit codes for a protein with 729 amino acids and a molecular weight of 81,730, and the beta gene for a protein with 674 amino acids and a molecular weight of 72,928. The alpha subunit follows the beta subunit by 23 bases and the genes for both subunits are preceded by a sequence which is similar to the Shine-Dalgarno sequence of Escherichia coli. No significant amino acid sequence homology has been found to any known sequence. Labeling CODH with 2,4-dinitrophenylsulfenyl chloride and isolating labeled peptide fragments demonstrated that a tryptophan, residue 418 of the alpha subunit, is protected by coenzyme A and thus may be considered a potential part of the coenzyme A site."
https://openalex.org/W1532747851,"The oxalate-degrading enzyme oxalate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.2), which is inducible by oxalic acid, was purified to homogeneity from a crude extract of Collybia velutipes, a basidiomycetous fungus. Two forms of the enzyme were resolved on chromatofocusing. The two isozymes were shown to be related by amino acid composition, peptide mapping, and immunological cross-reactivity. Peak A, eluting at pH 3.3, was used for further study; the Km was found to be 4.5 mM, and the Vmax was 166 mumol/min/mg. The subunit molecular mass of the glycosylated enzyme was 64 kDa, whereas the mass of the deglycosylated protein was 55 kDa. The enzyme showed an acidic pl, was very stable over a wide pH range, and was moderately thermostable. The cDNA encoding the enzyme was obtained by immunoscreening a lambda gt11 expression library. In vitro translation of hybrid-selected mRNA gave a 55-kDa protein. Genomic Southern hybridization indicated the oxalate decarboxylase is encoded by a single gene. The cDNA probe hybridized to a single 1.5-kilobase pair species of mRNA. The mRNA was shown to be induced by oxalic acid. A temporal relationship between enzyme activity and mRNA levels was observed, thus suggesting that the expression of oxalate decarboxylase is regulated at the transcriptional level."
https://openalex.org/W1560887909,"Abstract Signals that can mediate ligand-induced receptor internalization and calcium regulation are present in a 48-amino acid calcium-internalization domain in the C' terminus of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor. The basis of calcium and internalization regulation signalled by this 48-amino acid sequence was analyzed using deletion and substitution mutant receptors. Cells expressing truncated receptors containing either the NH2- or COOH-terminal portion of the 48-residue domain displayed high affinity EGF-dependent endocytosis and receptor down-regulation. These endocytosis-competent EGF receptor mutants that lacked any autophosphorylation site were unable to increase the concentration of intracellular calcium. To investigate the role of self-phosphorylation in EGF-induced calcium mobilization, phenylalanine was substituted for the single autophosphorylated tyrosine residue in this region of an internalization-competent truncated receptor. The receptor-mediated calcium response was abolished, while ligand-dependent receptor internalization was unimpaired. These results demonstrate that EGF-dependent receptor endocytosis and calcium mobilization are separate events. Tyrosine self-phosphorylation is required for increased [Ca2+]i, while structural features distinct from autophosphorylation are required for receptor internalization."
https://openalex.org/W1538741557,"The activity of solanesyl-diphosphate synthase from Micrococcus luteus is stimulated by a high molecular mass fraction (HMF) which is separated from cell-free extracts of the same bacterium by DEAE-Toyopearl chromatography followed by Sephadex G-100 chromatography. By employing HMF in the assay procedure, solanesyl-diphosphate synthase was able to be purified to homogeneity and was found to be a homodimer with a monomeric molecular mass of 34 kDa. In contrast to hexaprenyl- and heptaprenyl-diphosphate synthases, which are composed of two easily dissociable components that are inactive unless combined, the homogeneously purified solanesyl-diphosphate synthase itself showed a catalytic activity, though weak, catalyzing the synthesis of both (all-E)-nonaprenyl-(solanesyl-) and (all-E)-octaprenyl diphosphate. HMF does not affect the stability of solanesyl-diphosphate synthase or Km values for isopentenyl diphosphate and farnesyl diphosphate, but it markedly increases Vmax values in a time-dependent manner. Several lines of evidence indicate that HMF contains a factor which binds to polyprenyl products and removes them out of the active site of enzyme to facilitate and maintain the turnover of catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1646486931,"Interferon-alpha (IFN alpha) induces an immediate transcriptional response of a restricted set of genes in target cells. Specific transcription is mediated by the cytoplasmic activation of a transcription factor complex termed ISGF3. ISGF3 is a multimeric protein complex composed of a regulatory component (ISGF3 alpha), which is activated following IFN alpha treatment, and a DNA-binding component (ISGF3 gamma), which recognizes the IFN alpha-stimulated response element (ISRE). Following activation, ISGF3 alpha translocates to the nucleus where ISGF3 assembles as a high affinity complex on the ISRE. The biochemical basis for receptor-mediated activation of ISGF3 is unknown. We report that two potent protein kinase inhibitors, staurosporine and K-252a, ablated the transcriptional response to IFN alpha treatment. These inhibitors prevented the activation of the ISGF3 alpha component without affecting the ISGF3 gamma component, resulting in no accumulation of mature ISGF3 in nuclei of treated cells. Although these agents are potent inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC), PKC does not mediate ISGF3 alpha activation. Down-regulation of PKC by chronic exposure of cells to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, which led to complete loss of PKC-immunoreactive material, failed to ablate the transcriptional response to IFN alpha or the activation of ISGF3 alpha. The PKC-specific inhibitor calphostin C did not perturb activation or nuclear accumulation of ISGF3. We conclude that a novel, staurosporine/K-252a-sensitive kinase is required for ISGF3 activity and may participate in receptor-mediated signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1562495055,"The targeting of cytosolically synthesized proteins into the lumen is mediated by an aminoterminal pre-sequence consisting of an envelope and a thylakoid signal in tandem. We have investigated the structural characteristics of several transfer signals by determining the intermediate sites at which the stromal processing peptidase cleaves to remove the transit sequences. Using this approach we have found that the transfer signals of Silene pratensis plastocyanin, 23-kDa oxygen-evolving complex protein from wheat, and 33-kDa oxygen-evolving complex protein from wheat, are 25, 39, and 48 residues in length, respectively. All of the transfer signals contain hydrophobic core sequences and a -3,-1 motif reminiscent of those found in signal sequences, but the amino-terminal regions of the transfer signals of the 23- and 33-kDa proteins are both longer and more highly charged. The net charge of each amino-terminal region of the transfer sequences is +1, including the amino-terminal amino group. In each case, the stromal processing peptidase cleaves immediately after a positively charged residue, but otherwise the cleavage sites exhibit no common elements of either primary or secondary structure."
https://openalex.org/W1511839959,"Thymosin beta 10 is one of a small family of proteins closely related in sequence to thymosin beta 4, recently identified as an actin-sequestering protein. A single molecular weight species of thymosin beta 10 mRNA is present in a number of rat tissues. In adult rat testis, an additional thymosin beta 10 mRNA of higher molecular weight was identified. Nucleotide sequencing of cDNA clones complementary to the testis-specific thymosin mRNA indicated that this mRNA differed from the ubiquitous thymosin beta 10 mRNA only in its 5'-untranslated region, beginning 14 nucleotides upstream of the translation initiation codon. These results, together with primer extension experiments, suggest that the two thymosin beta 10 mRNAs are transcribed from the same gene through a combination of differential promoter utilization and alternative splicing. The novel thymosin beta 10 mRNA could be detected only in RNA isolated from sexually mature rat testis. Both mRNAs were present in pachytene spermatocytes; only the testis-specific mRNA was detected in postmeiotic haploid spermatids. Immunoblot analysis using specific antibodies showed that the thymosin beta 10 protein synthesized in adult testis was identical in size to that synthesized in brain. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the protein was present in differentiating spermatids, suggesting that the testis-specific thymosin beta 10 mRNA is translated in haploid male germ cells."
https://openalex.org/W1517531742,"We have isolated a partial cDNA for alpha 1(XI) collagen from a bovine smooth muscle cell (SMC) library. Previously, this collagen was not known to be expressed in SMCs. Comparison of the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of the 2.7-kilobase bovine clone and the human alpha 1(XI) sequence indicates 92 and 98% homology, respectively. Bovine SMCs in culture were found to produce alpha 1(XI) mRNA. However, alpha 2(XI) and alpha 1(II) collagen RNA were not detectable; therefore, SMCs cannot synthesize the same type XI collagen as found in cartilage. Since type XI collagen is structurally related to type V collagen, the expression of alpha 1(XI) and alpha 2(V) collagen mRNA in SMCs was characterized. Levels of alpha 1(XI) and alpha 2(V) collagen mRNAs were low in exponentially growing SMCs and increased 3-4-fold as cells became confluent. Increased mRNA levels were also observed when exponentially growing subconfluent SMCs were incubated in medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 24 h, similar to the effects of serum deprivation on the expression of types I and III collagen genes (Kindy, M. S., Chang, C.-J., and Sonenshein, G. E. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 11426-11430). However, as cell density increased, serum deprivation resulted in very different responses for these collagen genes. Serum deprivation caused a decrease in expression of alpha 1(XI) and alpha 2(V) collagen mRNAs in cultures as they approached confluence. In contrast, at confluence alpha 1(I) and alpha 2(I) mRNA levels no longer responded to serum concentration whereas expression of alpha 1(III) mRNA remained inducible by serum deprivation. These results suggest concerted regulation of alpha 1(XI) and alpha 2(V) collagen gene expression, which is distinct from that for the chains of type I and type III collagen with respect to cell density and serum."
https://openalex.org/W1537966043,"Radiolabeled cis-(+-)-5,6-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (5(6)-EpETrE) was incubated with a suspension of isolated human platelets in order to study its metabolic fate. The epoxide slowly disappeared from the suspension and was completely metabolized within 30 min. After extraction and analysis by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, seven metabolites were found. Addition of either indomethacin (0.01 mM, cyclooxygenase inhibitor) or BW755C (0.1 mM, cyclooxygenase/lipoxygenase inhibitor) to the incubations blocked the formation of four and six metabolites, respectively, 1,2-Epoxy-3,3,3-trichloropropane (inhibitor of microsomal epoxide hydrolase) failed to inhibit the formation of 5,6-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (5,6-DiHETrE), a hydrolysis product of the precursor 5(6)-EpETrE. The metabolites were characterized by UV spectroscopy, negative ion chemical ionization liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and, in one instance, coelution with synthetic standard. Three primary platelet metabolites were structurally determined to be 5,6-epoxy-12-hydroxyeicosatrienoic acid, 5,6-epoxy-12-hydroxyheptadecadienoic acid, and a unique bicyclic metabolite, 5-hydroxy-6,9-epoxy-thromboxane B1, which originated from intramolecular hydrolysis of 5,6-epoxythromboxane-B1. This thromboxane analog was partially separated into stereoisomers and coeluted with the racemic synthetic standard in gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Three other metabolites were characterized as 5,6,12-trihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid, 5,6,12-trihydroxyheptadecadienoic acid, and 5,6-dihydroxythromboxane-B1, and resulted from the hydrolysis of the corresponding epoxides rather than from the metabolism of 5,6-DiHETrE. The latter was not metabolized by platelet cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenase. The biosynthesis of two cyclooxygenase metabolites indicated the formation of unstable 5,6-epoxythromboxane-A1 as an intermediate precursor. Platelet aggregation was not induced by 5(6)-EpETrE, although responsiveness to arachidonic acid was reduced following preincubation with the epoxide. The platelet metabolites of 5(6)-EpETrE might be useful in assessing its in vivo production in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1552289378,"We describe here a detailed analysis of the methylation patterns of the apoC-III and apoA-IV genes in adult and embryonic tissues. Together with previously reported data on the human apoA-I gene (4), the results presented here constitute a comprehensive study on the methylation pattern of the apoA-I/C-III/A-IV gene cluster. The two genes (apoC-III and apoA-IV) display tissue-specific methylation patterns that correlate with their activity. This gene-specific methylation pattern indicates that the apoA-I/C-III/A-IV gene cluster is not one entity with respect to methylation. The cluster is almost entirely methylated in tissues that do not express any of the genes; however, individual gene regions are unmethylated in the tissue of expression. A comparison of the observed methylation patterns in adult tissues with those in embryonic tissues suggests that the mature tissue-specific methylation patterns are a result of an interplay between demethylation and de novo methylation events in the embryo. These changes in DNA methylation include demethylation in the early embryo followed by de novo methylation at later stages. A second round of tissue-specific demethylation and methylation de novo occurs in the late embryo as well. Evidence presented here supports the idea that CpG islands are protected in general from methylation de novo by a built-in signal and not by CpG density per se."
https://openalex.org/W1607954829,"We have demonstrated translocation of HL-60 cell 5-lipoxygenase to a membrane compartment in response to both the calcium ionophore A23187 and the receptor-mediated stimulus, N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP). In addition, we have shown inhibition of A23187- and fMLP-induced 5-lipoxygenase translocation by an indole and a quinoline leukotriene synthesis inhibitor, MK-886 and L-674,573, respectively. Selectivity of inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase translocation in both fMLP- or A23187-challenged cells is shown using the indole L-583,916 and quinoline L-671,480, which neither inhibit leukotriene synthesis nor inhibit 5-lipoxygenase translocation. The present study in HL-60 cells is the first demonstration of the selective inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase translocation by quinoline leukotriene synthesis inhibitors, exemplified by L-674,573. Also described here is the first demonstration of 5-lipoxygenase translocation and inhibition in response to a stimulus other than A23187, namely the receptor-mediated stimulus, fMLP."
https://openalex.org/W1589227311,"The precursor of platelet membrane glycoprotein IIb (GPIIb) undergoes endoproteolytic cleavage into heavy and light chains post-translation. Endoproteolysis occurs within a 17-amino acid stretch of the precursor that contains 4 arginine residues, 3 in dibasic sequences [Lys-Arg (855-856) and Arg-Arg (858-859)] and a single arginine at 871. To determine the site of GPIIb cleavage and its role in the function of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa heterodimer, we mutated arginine 856, the di-arginine sequence 858-859, and arginine 871 and coexpressed the mutants with glycoprotein IIIa (GPIIIa) in COS-1 cells. Each GPIIb mutant formed recombinant GPIIb-IIIa heterodimers, but mutants lacking arginine at 856 or 858-859 failed to undergo cleavage. Nevertheless, heterodimers containing the uncleaved GPIIb were expressed on the cell surface. Because endoproteolysis most often occurs after arginines in dibasic sequences, we next expressed GPIIb mutants containing lysine at 856 or aspartic acid at 855 with GPIIIa. Both mutants were cleaved and surface-expressed, indicating that the dibasic sequence at 858-859, but not at 855-856, is required for GPIIb cleavage. Lastly, we tested the function of GPIIb-IIIa containing uncleaved GPIIb by measuring adhesion of transfected cells to immobilized fibrinogen. We found no difference in the adhesion of cells expressing either wild-type or mutant GPIIb, indicating GPIIb-IIIa heterodimers containing uncleaved GPIIb maintain their ability to interact with fibrinogen."
https://openalex.org/W1516597546,"A two-dimensional NMR study has been carried out on the four-iron clusters of a bacterial oxidized ferredoxin for the purpose of investigating the relationship between contact shift patterns and the orientation of the individual coordinated cysteines. The ferredoxin from Clostridium pasteurianum, CpFdox, was selected because of its extensive sequence homology, and likely close structural similarity, to the crystallographically characterized ferredoxin from Peptococcus aerogenes, Pa Fdox (Adman, E.T., Sieker, L.C., and Jensen, L. H. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 3987-3996). Rapid data collection rates with minimal but adequate acquisition time allowed the detection of numerous CpFdox cross-peaks from the contact-shifted and strongly relaxed coordinated cysteinyl C beta H protons in the resolved 10-20 ppm window. Relatively strong magnitude COSY cross peaks from the resolved eight cysteinyl C beta H resonance unambiguously locate the geminal C beta H partner for each residue; weaker cross-peaks locate the C alpha Hs from three of the residues. The geminal nature of the magnitude-COSY detected partners to the resolved C beta H peaks is confirmed by strong NOESY cross-peaks. The NOESY spectra, moreover, assign an additional two cysteinyl C alpha H resonances. The present results confirm some previous one-dimensional NOE assignments, revise others, and locate resonances previously undetected (Bertini, I., Briganti, F., Luchinat, C., and Scozzafara, A. (1990) Inorg. Chem. 29, 1874-1880). A striking pairwise pseudo-symmetry in cysteinyl contact shift patterns is observed which is attributed to the previously recognized pseudo-symmetry in the crystal of PaFdox. A detailed analysis of the structural/electronic determinants of the coordinated cysteine C beta H contact shift pattern is made, and the NMR data necessary for unique interpretation are identified. It is shown that analysis of the relaxation properties of cysteine beta-methylene protons provides the stereospecific assignments necessary for comparison of shift ratios with crystallographic structural data. The available structural data on PaFdox (Backes, G., Mino, Y., Loehr, T., Meyer, T., Cusanovich, M., Sweeney, W., Adman, E., and Sanders-Loehr, J. (1991) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 13, 2055-2064) are qualitatively but not quantitatively consistent with the observed cysteinyl contact shift pattern, with the NMR data reflecting more asymmetry than previous studies. A tentative assignment of a single pair of symmetry-related cysteines is proposed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1509320985,"Human glycophorin Sta (HGpSta), one of the structural variants of erythrocyte membrane sialoglycoproteins, is encoded by a delta-alpha hybrid gene that arose from a single unequal crossover between the parent HGpB(delta) and HGpA(alpha) genes. We report here the identification of two new HGpSta genes (type A and type B) in four unrelated Sta heterozygotes from two ethnic groups. These Sta genes represent distinct genetic isoforms that differ from the previously reported Sta gene (type C) in the location of crossing-over sites. Comparison of nucleotide sequences among HGpB(delta), HGpA(alpha), and HGpSta type A genes revealed that the delta-alpha unequal crossover for the Sta type A gene occurred 110-246 base pairs downstream from pseudoexon III. In the crossing-over site of this Sta gene, an AT-rich sequence lying 3' to a nonameric palindrome was found to be highly similar to the lambda phage attachment site, att B, in inverted orientation. In the Sta type B gene, the delta-alpha crossing-over point was localized to an AG-rich sequence that is 302-490 base pairs downstream from pseudoexon III. Multiple lambda chi-like elements were identified at the crossover boundaries and within the breakpoint of this Sta gene. These results suggest strongly that recurrent and independent unequal recombination events have occurred in the formation of multiple Sta genes and that particular genomic sequences are important in defining the recombination sites for these homology-driven processes."
https://openalex.org/W1959805879,"Thromboxane synthase is a ferrihemoprotein which undergoes mechanism-based inactivation during catalysis. This process may be an important factor for limiting thromboxane A2 biosynthesis in cells. Although the kinetics have been characterized for purified enzyme and platelets, the chemical basis for inactivation has remained unclear. Protein modification or alteration of the heme prosthetic group is each compatible with the irreversible nature of suicide inactivation of thromboxane synthase. We have investigated these two possibilities using enzyme purified to homogeneity. Our data show that the Soret absorbance spectrum of thromboxane synthase is unaltered by additions of prostaglandin endoperoxide H2 which cause enzymatic inactivation. Using a coupled cyclooxygenase/thromboxane synthase system and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis we have demonstrated that the enzyme retains radiolabel under nondenaturing gel conditions. Label incorporation is reduced by the competitive thromboxane synthase inhibitor U63557, an agent that also protects the enzyme from inactivation. Under denaturing conditions the radiolabel localizes with the released heme prosthetic group. In addition, interaction of the heme prosthetic group with cyanide was prevented by inactivating the enzyme with prostaglandin H2. In similar experiments, the lipid hydroperoxide 15(S)-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid inactivated thromboxane synthase with concurrent bleaching of the Soret spectrum. Labeling studies with a coupled soybean lipoxygenase/thromboxane synthase system indicate that, in this case, the apoenzyme is modified. These results suggest that the mechanism of thromboxane synthase inactivation during thromboxane A2 biosynthesis involves a tight, nondestructive association of substrate or product with the prosthetic heme group. Inactivation by hydroperoxides, however, appears to result from apoenzyme modification. These reactions may have important implications for cellular physiology and pathophysiology of thrombosis."
https://openalex.org/W1602494209,"The endoproteolytic activity previously detected in rat intestinal mucosal extracts (Beinfeld M., Bourdais, J., Kuks, P., Morel, A., and Cohen, P. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 4460-4465), was purified to homogeneity as a 65-kDa molecular species. This putative proprotein-processing enzyme cleaves the peptide bond on the carboxyl side of a single arginine residue in hepta-[Leu62-Gln-Arg-Ser-Ala-Asn-Ser68] or trideca-[Asp56-Glu-Met-Arg-Leu-Glu-Leu-Gln-Arg-Ser-Ala-Asn-+ ++Ser68] peptides, reproducing the prosomatostatin sequence around Arg64, the locus for endoproteolytic release of either somatostatin-28 or its NH2-terminal fragment, somatostatin-28-(1-12), from their common precursor. This enzyme exhibits a strict selectivity for arginyl residues, as demonstrated with related substrates, and did not cleave at lysyl residues. Moreover, only arginyl residues belonging to peptides of the prosomatostatin family were cleaved, since no hydrolysis of peptides from other prohormones was detected. In addition, the arginine residue situated at position -5 on the NH2-terminal side of Arg64 not only did not function as a cleavage locus, but had no effect on the overall cleavage kinetics of the prosomatostatin-(56-68) peptide substrate. This enzyme also cleaved, but with much less efficiency, the peptide bond on the carboxyl side of an arginine in peptides containing either an Arg-Lys or a Lys-Arg doublet corresponding to prohormone cleavage sites. This enzyme was insensitive to divalent cation chelators, was completely inhibited by aprotinin and leupeptin, and was somewhat inhibited by other serine-protease inhibitors. It is concluded that this endoprotease is a serine protease and could be involved in prohormone or proprotein post-translational processing at single arginine cleavage sites."
https://openalex.org/W1563989680,"The rat and mouse proenkephalin genes each contains two distinct promoters, one of which is utilized exclusively by spermatogenic cells. The germ cell-specific promoter lacks TATA sequences, is G+C rich, and contains multiple initiation sites. To investigate the nature of the cis-acting elements that determine selective transcription of the proenkephalin gene in male germ cells, two rat proenkephalin-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase fusion genes containing the two different promoter regions as well as 1.6 or 0.3 kilobases, respectively, of 5'-flanking sequence were expressed in transgenic mice. Multiple transgenic lines were developed which expressed the fusion genes in testis, brain, and heart but not in tissues that do not normally express the proenkephalin gene. Fusion gene transcripts in transgenic mouse testes were localized to those spermatogenic cell types that utilize the spermatogenic cell promoter and were selectively and accurately initiated from the multiple rat germ cell start sites. Transgenic mice thus provide a useful model for the localization and characterization of cis-acting elements mediating transcription of the proenkephalin gene from its germ cell-specific promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2112629837,"Hirugen, a synthetic dodecapeptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal amino acids 53-64 of hirudin, binds within a deep groove in thrombin that contains a cationic region referred to as the anion-binding exosite. This region is important in many of the binary interactions of thrombin with macromolecular substrates and cofactors. Fluorescein-labeled hirugen was used to probe which steps in the prothrombin activation process generate this anion-binding exosite. Two activation cleavage sites exist in bovine prothrombin. Cleavage at Arg274-Thr275 releases the activation fragments to generate the thrombin precursor, prethrombin 2. Cleavage of prothrombin within a disulfide loop at Arg323-Ile324 leads to formation of meizothrombin with no loss of peptide material but with formation of amidolytic activity. Cleavage of the same bond in prethrombin 2 generates thrombin. Hirugen, labeled at the amino terminus with fluorescein isothiocyanate, does not bind to prothrombin but does bind to thrombin (Kd = 9.6 +/- 1.2 x 10(-8) M), prethrombin 2 (Kd = 1.3 +/- 0.1 x 10(-7) M), thrombin-fragment-2 complex (Kd = 1.1 +/- 0.2 x 10(-6) M), and meizothrombin (Kd = 1.6 +/- 0.5 x 10(-8) M). Prothrombin fragment-2 and hirugen both bind independently to thrombin. A ternary complex can form with hirugen and fragment-2 and either thrombin or prethrombin 2, suggesting that fragment-2 and hirugen bind to discrete sites. Hirugen also alters the active site conformation of thrombin as detected by modulation of synthetic substrate hydrolytic activity. These studies suggest that conformational changes, rather than alleviating steric hindrance, are responsible for the formation of the hirugen-binding site during prothrombin activation. Furthermore, this conformational change can be effected by the cleavage of either of the two bonds required for activation of prothrombin."

The external aldimine intermediate is not detectable during reactions of this mutant with amino acids, although the inhibitor alpha-methylaspartate does slowly and stably form this species. These results suggest that external aldimine formation is one of the rate-determining steps of the reaction.

https://openalex.org/W1497408535,"The kinetic constants for the ADP-ribosylation of transducin were determined for the recombinant S1 subunit of pertussis toxin (rS1, composed of 235 amino acids) and two genetically derived deletion peptides, C180 and C195, which are composed of the 180 and 195 amino-terminal residues of the S1 subunit, respectively. Titration of NAD in the presence of a constant concentration of transducin (0.5 microM) showed that the KmappNAD in the ADP-ribosylation of transducin were similar, approximately 20 microM, for rS1, C195, and C180. In contrast, titration of transducin in the presence of a constant concentration of NAD (25 nM) showed that rS1 possessed a lower Kmapp(transducin) and greater kcat than either C195 or C180. Previous studies (Cortina, G., and Barbieri, J.T. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 3022-3030) showed that the 16 carboxyl terminal residues of the S1 subunit did not function in the ADP-ribosylation of transducin. It thus appears that residues between 195 and 219 of the S1 subunit are required for high affinity transducin binding and may be involved in the transfer of ADP-ribose to transducin. To localize the defect in the recognition of transducin by C180, rS1 and C180 were assayed for the ability to ADP-ribosylate either transducin or the purified alpha subunit of transducin (T alpha). Upon saturation of the target protein, rS1 ADP-ribosylated equivalent moles of transducin or T alpha, with the linear velocity of rS1-mediated ADP-ribosylation of transducin approximately 16-fold more rapid than the rate of ADP-ribosylation of T alpha. In contrast, the initial linear velocity of C180-mediated ADP-ribosylation of transducin was only 1.7-fold more rapid than the rate of ADP-ribosylation of T alpha. These data indicate that the amino-terminal 180 amino acids of S1 confer the specificity for ADP-ribosylation primarily through the interaction with T alpha, while residues between 195 and 219 of S1 confer high affinity binding to transducin primarily through the interaction, either directly or indirectly, with T beta gamma."

Complete 13C signal assignments were obtained by two-dimensional NMR experiments. The labeling pattern of factor III was analyzed by comparison with those of amino acids and nucleosides. The corrin ring system is derived from eight molecules of glutamate. The aminopropanol moiety is derived in a hitherto unknown pathway from pyruvate by reductive amination. The heterocyclic ring of hydroxybenzimidazole shares the labeling pattern of the imidazole ring of purines. The remaining four carbon atoms of the carbocyclic ring show the labeling signature of a carbohydrate with two of the carbons introduced from acetate and two from C-1 of pyruvate. However, erythrose can be ruled out as the specific precursor on the basis of a detailed investigation of aromatic amino acids indicating that erythrose 4-phosphate is obtained by reductive carboxylation of a triose precursor and not by the pentose phosphate cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1554274011,"Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), derived by enzymatic oxidation of cellular dihomogammalinolenic acid (DHLA) and arachidonic acid (AA), respectively, have diverse and, at times, distinct biological actions. It has been suggested that PGE1 specifically inhibits a variety of inflammatory processes, and, in light of the potential therapeutic benefit of PGE1 and its fatty acid precursor in inflammatory disorders, there is growing interest in the biochemical mechanisms which determine the balance between PGE1 and PGE2 synthesis. Metabolic studies in this area have been hampered by the difficulties in measuring the extremely small masses of these prostaglandins which are generated in cell culture systems. We studied the regulation of PGE1 versus PGE2 synthesis using an essential fatty acid-deficient, PGE-producing, mouse fibrosarcoma cell line, EFD-1. Because EFD-1 cells contain no endogenous AA or DHLA, we were able to replete the cells with AA and DHLA of known specific activities; thus, the mass of both cellular AA and DHLA, and synthesized PGE1 and PGE2, could be accurately determined. The major finding of this study is that production of PGE2 was highly favored over production of PGE1 due to preferential incorporation of AA versus DHLA into, and release from, the total cellular phospholipid pool. Further, we correlated the selective release of AA versus DHLA from total cellular phospholipids with the selective incorporation of AA versus DHLA into specific phospholipid pools. In addition, we showed that conversion of DHLA to AA by delta 5 desaturase was enhanced by increasing the cellular mass of n-6 fatty acids and by increasing the cell proliferative activity. Together, these results indicate that the relative abundance of PGE2 versus PGE1 in vivo is not merely a function of the relative abundance of AA versus DHLA in tissues, but also relates to markedly different cellular metabolism of these two fatty acids."
https://openalex.org/W2105669470,"The mechanism of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA epimerase (EC 5.1.2.3), which is associated with the multienzyme complex of fatty acid oxidation from Escherichia coli, was studied with D-3-hydroxy-4-trans-decenoyl-CoA as a substrate. The E. coli complex catalyzes the rapid and direct dehydration of D-3-hydroxy-4-trans-decenoyl-CoA to 2-trans,4-trans-decadienoyl-CoA, which is slowly hydrated to L-3-hydroxy-4-trans-decenoyl-CoA. A kinetic analysis of the epimerase and its partial reactions established that epimerization of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoAs occurs solely by a dehydration/hydration mechanism. The results of a substrate competition study with L-3-hydroxy-4-trans-decenoyl-CoA and its D-isomer, together with the conclusion from a sequence analysis of the large subunit of the E. coli complex (Yang, X.-Y., Schulz, H., Elzinga, M., and Yang, S.-Y. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 6788-6795), prompt the suggestion that a single active site is responsible for the dehydration of the D- and L-isomers of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoAs."
https://openalex.org/W1492869301,"Fusion of endosomes appears to be required at early steps of receptor-mediated endocytosis. These fusion events have been reconstituted using a cell-free assay and have been shown to require both cytosolic and membrane-associated proteins. We report here that trypsinization of endosomes completely inhibited fusion. Addition of untreated cytosol cannot restore fusion of trypsinized endosomes. However, fusion activity is restored by the addition of either untreated vesicles or a high salt extract containing peripheral membrane proteins (KE). KE contains both the membrane-associated factor(s) required for the reconstitution of fusion using trypsinized endosomes and the factors that are normally provided by the cytosol. The restorative activity of KE was sensitive to trypsin treatment or incubation at 100 degrees C, but was largely N-ethylmaleimide (NEM)-resistant. This and other criteria demonstrated that the trypsin-sensitive factor is distinct from N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF), an NEM-sensitive protein involved in vesicular fusion, and from other known factors that may participate in membrane fusion events. Preliminary fractionation studies indicate that the restorative activity of KE is associated with one or more high molecular weight proteins. The present study indicates that a novel trypsin-sensitive protein(s) is involved in endosome-endosome fusion. This factor is membrane-associated and is not found in an active form in cytosol as prepared."
https://openalex.org/W1547319143,"Endonuclease II of bacteriophage T4 is required for in vivo restriction of cytosine-containing DNA from its host, Escherichia coli, (as well as from phage mutants lacking cytosine modification), normally the first step in the reutilization of host DNA nucleotides for synthesis of phage DNA in infected cells. The phage cytosine-DNA is fragmented incompletely to yield genetically defined fragments. This restriction is different from that of type I, II, or III restriction enzymes. We have located seven major endonuclease II-dependent restriction sites in the T4 genome, of which three were analyzed in detail; in addition, abundant sites were cleaved in less than or equal to 5% of all molecules. Sites I, II, and III shared the sequence 5'-CCGNNTTGGC-3' and were cleaved in about 25% (I and III) and 65% (II) of all molecules, predominantly staggered around the first or second of the central unspecified base pairs to yield fragments with one 5' base. The less frequently cleaved sites I and III deviated from site II in predicted helical structure when viewed from the consensus strand, and in sequence when viewed from the opposite strand. Thus, interaction with a particular helical structure as well as recognition of the bases in DNA appears important for efficient cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W1551188906,"Using an in vitro processing system, we have identified a required sequence surrounding the Drosophila melanogaster 5 S RNA processing site at nucleotide 120. Mutations in this region vary the processing rate from complete inhibition to a level equal to or greater than wild type. Analysis of mutants at +1 and in the region 118-122 separates the inhibitory effect into two parts. 1) Nucleotide 118 C, the base-paired nucleotide in helix I proximal to the processing site, plays an essential role. Changing it to a purine inhibits processing. The +1-118 base pair must be intact, but this alone is not sufficient for processing, since compensatory changes at +1 do not restore down-processing mutants at 118 to the wild type level. 2) The processing site has to be pyrimidine rich; multiple contiguous purines inhibit processing. On the other hand, multiple pyrimidines can largely negate the inhibitory effect of a mutation at position 118. Thus a base-paired C at 118 followed by a stretch of pyrimidines is the processing signal, which may be recognized by the processing enzyme and/or a required accessory factor."
https://openalex.org/W1501265306,"Abstract Mirabilis antiviral protein (MAP) is a rigid, heat-stable protein composed of 250 amino acids with an intramolecular disulfide bond. MAP inhibits the in vitro protein synthesis of rabbit reticulocyte with approximately one-thirtieth the activity of the ricin A chain, a homologous protein with no such bond (Habuka, N., Murakami, Y., Noma, M., Kudo, T., and Horikoshi, K. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 6629-6637; Habuka, N., Akiyama, K., Tsuge, H., Miyano, M., Matsumoto, T., and Noma, M. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 10988-10992). The bond is presumed to induce some structural perturbation that alters the mode of interaction with the substrate ribosome and thus lowers the activity. To confirm this hypothesis, a mutant MAP gene in which the codons of both cysteines were replaced by those of serines was constructed and expressed in Escherichia coli, and its product (C36/22OS) was purified. In a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, C36/220S showed the same mobility as that of MAP reduced by 2-mercaptoethanol, whereas nonreduced MAP showed faster migration. The inhibitory activity of C36/220S was approximately 22 times higher than that of native MAP, that is the mutant had an IC50 of 0.16 nM for the protein synthesis of the rabbit reticulocyte system, whereas the native MAP had an IC50 of 3.5 nM. The results indicate that the activity of MAP is increased by the elimination of the disulfide bond, and this supports the hypothesis."
