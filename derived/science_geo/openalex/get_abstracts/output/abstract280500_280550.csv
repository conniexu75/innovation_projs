https://openalex.org/W2025441790,"Records of glacier fluctuations compiled by the World Glacier Monitoring Service can be used to derive an independent estimate of global warming during the last 100 years. Records of different glaciers are made comparable by a two-step scaling procedure: one allowing for differences in glacier geometry, the other for differences in climate sensitivity. The retreat of glaciers during the last 100 years appears to be coherent over the globe. On the basis of modeling of the climate sensitivity of glaciers, the observed glacier retreat can be explained by a linear warming trend of 0.66 kelvin per century."
https://openalex.org/W1983587741,"Measurements of stomatal density and delta(13)C of limber pine (Pinus flexilis) needles (leaves) preserved in pack rat middens from the Great Basin reveal shifts in plant physiology and leaf morphology during the last 30,000 years. Sites were selected so as to offset glacial to Holocene climatic differences and thus to isolate the effects of changing atmospheric CO(2) levels. Stomatal density decreased approximately 17 percent and delta(13)C decreased approximately 1.5 per mil during deglaciation from 15,000 to 12,000 years ago, concomitant with a 30 percent increase in atmospheric CO(2). Water-use efficiency increased approximately 15 percent during deglaciation, if temperature and humidity were held constant and the proxy values for CO(2) and delta(13)C of past atmospheres are accurate. The delta(13)C variations may help constrain hypotheses about the redistribution of carbon between the atmosphere and biosphere during the last glacial-interglacial cycle."

The color is structural rather than pigmentary, and originates from optical interference in a microscopic lamellar system associated with ridges on the outer scales of the wing. The dimensions and angular orientation of the lamellar system conform to predictions based on physical measurement of the spectral characteristics, including ""color shifts"" with varying angles of incidence, of the reflected ultraviolet light. The female lacks such scales and is consequently nonreflectant. The ultraviolet dimorphism supposedly serves as the basis for sexual recognition in courtship."
https://openalex.org/W1994117362,"Linked by strings of diphenylhexatriene (DPH) molecules, beta- and gamma-cyclodextrins (CDs) can form nanotube aggregates that contain as many as approximately 20 betaCDs (20 nanometers long) or approximately 20 to 35 gammaCDs (20 to 35 nanometers long). Nanotube formation was indicated in solution, by fluorescence anisotropy and light scattering results, and on graphite surfaces, by scanning tunneling microscopy. Tubes were not observed for the smaller alphaCDs. Molecular modeling shows that CD cavity size and the rodlike DPH structure are key factors in nanotube formation. Spectra generated by proton nuclear magnetic resonance indicate the inclusion of DPH in the interior of the CDs and formation of nanotubes in betaCDs and gammaCDs only. The photophysical properties of DPH are affected by its arrangement into a one-dimensional array within the CD nanotube, possibly because of exciton formation."

These results suggest that rats can learn by imitation. Learning by rats that observed conspecifics not emitting response-relevant cues was retarded compared to learning by rats that did not observe conspecifics. This indicates that a conspecific's presence can also inhibit learning, a result consistent with social facilitation theory."

The heat is produced primarily by small, sterile male flowers that are capable of consuming oxygen at rates approaching those of flying hummingbirds and sphinx moths."
https://openalex.org/W1981351656,"The issue of infant intelligence as a unitary concept was attacked. Using data from three different tests of infant intelligence, it was shown that infant intelligence is neither unitary nor stable over the first two years of life. Implications for intervention programs were discussed in light of the failure to produce meaningful criterion measures"
https://openalex.org/W2024992736,"Nitrogen fixation by Dichothrix fucicola, an epiphyte on pelagic Sargassum, was measured in May and June 1972 in the western Sargasso Sea and the Gulf Stream. This is the first report of nitrogen fixation by a heterocyst-bearing blue-green alga in the open ocean, and also the first observation of nitrogen fixation in the genus Dichothrix. Cellular carbon/nitrogen ratios suggested that the Dichothrix was nitrogen-starved. In dense aggregations of Sargassum, such as rafts or windrows, the enrichment of surface seawater with combined nitrogen from nitrogen fixation may be pronounced."

https://openalex.org/W2081865697,Neutron scattering has played a key role in the microscopic understanding of the static and dynamic properties of magnetic materials. Modulated magnetic structures first discovered in the late fifties can no longer be referred to as exotic; more than a hundred such phases have already been found in a variety of magnetic systems. Neutron and x-ray magnetic scattering have played a complementary role in the recent discovery and understanding of the modulated magnetic phases in rare earth metallic systems.
https://openalex.org/W2028978448,"Recent studies indicate that variation in the sun's luminosity is less than that observed in many other stars of similar magnetic activity. Current findings also indicate that in more active stars, the attenuation by faculae of sunspot luminosity modulation is less effective than in the sun at present. The sun could thus become photometrically more variable (and dimmer) if its magnetic activity exceeded present levels. But the levels of solar activity required for this to occur are not observed in carbon-14 and beryllium-10 records over the past several millennia, which indicates that such an increase in amplitude of surface magnetism-driven variations in solar luminosity is unlikely in the present epoch."

https://openalex.org/W2098898172,"I have reviewed the historical and contemporary experiments that guide us in choosing a post-Newtonian, relativistic gravitational theory. The foundation experiments essentially constrain gravitation theory to be a metric theory in which matter couples solely to one gravitational field, the metric field, although other cosmological gravitational fields may exist. The metric field for any metric theory can be specified (for the solar system, for our present purposes) by a series of potential terms with several parameters. A variety of experiments specify (or put limits on) the numerical values of the seven parameters in the post-Newtonian metric field, and other such experiments have been planned. The empirical results, to date, yield values of the parameters that are consistent with the predictions of Einstein's general relativity."

https://openalex.org/W2022229713,Thermodynamic analysis establishes the equilibrium relationships between the concentrations and partial pressures of the components of liquid and gaseous solutions in the presence of a gravitational field. The conditions of equilibrium between a column of gas and gas-saturated water and the conditions of equilibrium governing a model of the distribution of radioactive heat sources in surface rocks are deduced from the theory.

https://openalex.org/W4231493577,"While some physicists ponder the grand design of the universe, others delve to the atomic scale. That microrealm was the focus of most of the 5300 researchers specializing in biological and condensed-matter physics and in materials science who gathered in Pittsburgh two weeks ago for the annual March meeting of the American Physical Society (APS). Among the more than 5000 papers presented at the meeting were descriptions of building and measuring micromagnets, making atomic movies, and studying sand grains for clues to why some dunes roar."
