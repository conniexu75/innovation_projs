https://openalex.org/W2002519246,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 2 (PPAR gamma 2) is an adipocyte-specific nuclear hormone receptor that has recently been identified as a key regulator of two fat cell enhancers. Transcriptional activation by PPAR gamma 2 is potentiated by a variety of lipids and lipid-like compounds, including naturally occurring polyunsaturated fatty acids. We demonstrate here that retroviral expression of PPAR gamma 2 stimulates adipose differentiation of cultured fibroblasts. PPAR activators promote the differentiation of PPAR gamma 2-expressing cells in a dose-dependent manner. C/EBP alpha, a second transcription factor induced during adipocyte differentiation, can cooperate with PPAR gamma 2 to stimulate the adipocyte program dramatically. Our results suggest that the physiologic role of PPAR gamma 2 is to regulate development of the adipose lineage in response to endogenous lipid activators and that this factor may serve to link the process of adipocyte differentiation to systemic lipid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2158748165,"Amyloid beta protein (A beta) is a 40-43 amino acid peptide that is associated with plaques in the brains of Alzheimer's patients and is cytotoxic to cultured neurons. Using both primary central nervous system cultures and clonal cell lines, it is shown that a number of anti-oxidants protect cells from A beta toxicity, suggesting that at least one pathway to A beta cytotoxicity results in free radical damage. A beta causes increased levels of H2O2 and lipid peroxides to accumulate in cells. The H2O2-degrading enzyme catalase protects cells from A beta toxicity. Clonal cell lines selected for their resistance to A beta toxicity also become resistant to the cytolytic action of H2O2. In addition, A beta induces the activity of NF-kappa B, a transcription factor thought to be regulated by oxidative stress. Finally, A beta-induced H2O2 production and A beta toxicity are blocked by reagents that inhibit flavin oxidases, suggesting that A beta activates a member of this class of enzymes. These results show that the cytotoxic action of A beta on neurons results from free radical damage to susceptible cells."
https://openalex.org/W2029152767,"In vitro synthesis of endoplasmic reticulum-derived transport vesicles has been reconstituted with washed membranes and three soluble proteins (Sar1p, Sec13p complex, and Sec23p complex). Vesicle formation requires GTP but can be driven by nonhydrolyzable analogs such as GMP-PNP. However, GMP-PNP vesicles fail to target and fuse with the Golgi complex whereas GTP vesicles are functional. All the cytosolic proteins required for vesicle formation are retained on GMP-PNP vesicles, while Sar1p dissociates from GTP vesicles. Thin section electron microscopy of purified preparations reveals a uniform population of 60-65 nm vesicles with a 10 nm thick electron dense coat. The subunits of this novel coat complex are molecularly distinct from the constituents of the nonclathrin coatomer involved in intra-Golgi transport. Because the overall cycle of budding driven by these two types of coats appears mechanistically similar, we propose that the coat structures be called COPI and COPII."
https://openalex.org/W2008118471,"The detection of odorant receptor mRNAs within the axon terminals of sensory neurons has permitted us to ask whether neurons expressing a given receptor project their axons to common glomeruli within the olfactory bulb. In situ hybridization with five different receptor probes demonstrates that axons from neurons expressing a given receptor converge on one, or at most, a few glomeruli within the olfactory bulb. Moreover, the position of specific glomeruli is bilaterally symmetric and is constant in different individuals within a species. These data support a model in which exposure to a given odorant may result in the stimulation of a spatially restricted set of glomeruli, such that the individual odorants would be associated with specific topographic patterns of activity within the olfactory bulb."
https://openalex.org/W2018139276,"Endothelins act on two subtypes of G protein-coupled receptors, termed endothelin-A and endothelin-B receptors. We report a targeted disruption of the mouse endothelin-B receptor (EDNRB) gene that results in aganglionic megacolon associated with coat color spotting, resembling a hereditary syndrome of mice, humans, and other mammalian species. Piebald-lethal (sl) mice exhibit a recessive phenotype identical to that of the EDNRB knockout mice. In crossbreeding studies, the two mutations show no complementation. Southern blotting revealed a deletion encompassing the entire EDNRB gene in the sl chromosome. A milder allele, piebald (s), which produces coat color spotting only, expresses low levels of structurally intact EDNRB mRNA and protein. These findings indicate an essential role for EDNRB in the development of two neural crest-derived cell lineages, myenteric ganglion neurons and epidermal melanocytes. We postulate that defects in the human EDNRB gene cause a hereditary form of Hirschsprung's disease that has recently been mapped to human chromosome 13, in which EDNRB is located."
https://openalex.org/W2074170762,"Defects in the gene encoding the endothelin-B receptor produce aganglionic megacolon and pigmentary disorders in mice and humans. We report that a targeted disruption of the mouse endothelin-3 ligand (EDN3) gene produces a similar recessive phenotype of megacolon and coat color spotting. A natural recessive mutation that results in the same developmental defects in mice, lethal spotting (ls), failed to complement the targeted EDN3 allele. The ls mice carry a point mutation of the EDN3 gene, which replaces the Arg residue at the C-terminus of the inactive intermediate big EDN3 with a Trp residue. This mutation prevents the proteolytic activation of big EDN3 by ECE-1. These findings indicate that interaction of EDN3 with the endothelin-B receptor is essential in the development of neural crest-derived cell lineages. We postulate that defects in the human EDN3 gene may cause Hirschsprung's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2122748184,"The crystal structure of the processivity factor required by eukaryotic DNA polymerase delta, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) from S. cerevisiae, has been determined at 2.3 A resolution. Three PCNA molecules, each containing two topologically identical domains, are tightly associated to form a closed ring. The dimensions and electrostatic properties of the ring suggest that PCNA encircles duplex DNA, providing a DNA-bound platform for the attachment of the polymerase. The trimeric PCNA ring is strikingly similar to the dimeric ring formed by the beta subunit (processivity factor) of E. coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, with which it shares no significant sequence identity. This structural correspondence further substantiates the mechanistic connection between eukaryotic and prokaryotic DNA replication that has been suggested on biochemical grounds."
https://openalex.org/W2062423918,"Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) is characterized by an absence of enteric ganglia in the distal colon and a failure of innervation in the gastrointestinal tract. We recently mapped a recessive susceptibility locus (HSCR2) to human chromosome 13q22, which we now demonstrate to be the endothelin-B receptor gene (EDNRB). We identified in HSCR patients a Gâ†’T missense mutation in EDNRB exon 4 that substitutes the highly conserved Trp-276 residue in the fifth transmembrane helix of the G protein-coupled receptor with a Cys residue (W276C). The mutant W276C receptor exhibited a partial impairment of ligand-induced Ca2+ transient levels in transfected cells. The mutation is dosage sensitive, in that W276C homozygotes and heterozygotes have a 74% and a 21% risk, respectively, of developing HSCR. Genotype analysis of patients in a Mennonite pedigree shows HSCR to be a multigenic disorder."
https://openalex.org/W1971943177,"Proper limb growth and patterning requires signals from the zone of polarizing activity in the posterior mesoderm and from the overlying apical ectodermal ridge (AER). Sonic hedgehog and Fgf-4, respectively, have recently been identified as candidates for these signals. We have dissected the roles of these secreted proteins in early limb development by ectopically regulating their activities in a number of surgical contexts. Our results indicate that Sonic hedgehog initiates expression of secondary signaling molecules, including Bmp-2 in the mesoderm and Fgf-4 in the ectoderm. The mesoderm requires ectodermally derived competence factors, which include Fgf-4, to activate target gene expression in response to Sonic hedgehog. The expression of Sonic hedgehog and Fgf-4 is coordinately regulated by a positive feedback loop operating between the posterior mesoderm and the overlying AER. Taken together, these data provide a basis for understanding the integration of growth and patterning in the developing limb."
https://openalex.org/W2102948276,"Dilysine motifs in cytoplasmic domains of transmembrane proteins are signals for their continuous retrieval from the Golgi back to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We describe a system to assess retrieval to the ER in yeast cells making use of a dilysine-tagged Ste2 protein. Whereas retrieval was unaffected in most sec mutants tested (sec7, sec12, sec13, sec16, sec17, sec18, sec19, sec22, and sec23), a defect in retrieval was observed in previously characterized coatomer mutants (sec21-1, sec27-1), as well as in newly isolated retrieval mutants (sec21-2, ret1-1). RET1 was cloned by complementation and found to encode the alpha subunit of coatomer. While temperature-sensitive for growth, the newly isolated coatomer mutants exhibited a very modest defect in secretion at the nonpermissive temperature. Coatomer from beta'-COP (sec27-1) and alpha-COP (ret1-1) mutants, but not from gamma-COP (sec21) mutants, had lost the ability to bind dilysine motifs in vitro. Together, these results suggest that coatomer plays an essential role in retrograde Golgi-to-ER transport and retrieval of dilysine-tagged proteins back to the ER."
https://openalex.org/W1551136355,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common genetic disorder that frequently results in renal failure due to progressive cyst development. The major locus, PKD1, maps to 16p13.3. We identified a chromosome translocation associated with ADPKD that disrupts a gene (PBP) encoding a 14 kb transcript in the PKD1 candidate region. Further mutations of the PBP gene were found in PKD1 patients, two deletions (one a de novo event) and a splicing defect, confirming that PBP is the PKD1 gene. This gene is located adjacent to the TSC2 locus in a genomic region that is reiterated more proximally on 16p. The duplicate area encodes three transcripts substantially homologous to the PKD1 transcript. Partial sequence analysis of the PKD1 transcript shows that it encodes a novel protein whose function is at present unknown."
https://openalex.org/W2074059194,"Studies of T cell responses to altered peptide ligands (APLs) have provided functional evidence that a T cell receptor (TCR) can interpret subtle changes in its ligand, resulting in different phenotypic outcomes. One dramatic effect of APL stimulation with live antigen-presenting cells (APCs) is the induction of anergy as opposed to proliferation. We investigated the intracellular signaling events involved in generating this unresponsiveness by comparing protein-tyrosine phosphorylation patterns after stimulation with anergy-inducing APL or the immunogenic peptide. In resting T cell clones, presentation with APL/live APC stimulated a unique pattern of TCR phospho-Î¶ species and a subsequent lack of association with zap70. This demonstrates that the TCR-CD3 complex can engage selective intracellular biochemical signaling pathways as a direct consequence of the nature of the ligand recognized and the initial phosphotyrosine pattern of the TCR-CD3 proteins, leading to different phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2048994813,"An early step in the development of vertebrae, ribs, muscle, and dermis is the differentiation of the somitic mesoderm into dermomyotome dorsally and sclerotome ventrally. To analyze this process, we have developed an in vitro assay for somitic mesoderm differentiation. We show that sclerotomal markers can be induced by a diffusible factor secreted by notochord and floor plate and that heterologous cells expressing Sonic hedgehog (shh/vhh-1) mimic this effect. In contrast, expression of dermomyotomal markers can be caused by a contact-dependent signal from surface ectoderm and a diffusible signal from dorsal neural tube. Our results extend previous studies by suggesting that dorsoventral patterning of somites involves the coordinate action of multiple dorsalizing and ventralizing signals and that a diffusible form of Shh/Vhh-1 mediates sclerotome induction."
https://openalex.org/W2158955459,"Human hepatitis B virus core protein expressed in E. coli assembles into two sizes of particle. We have determined their three-dimensional structures by electron cryomicroscopy and image processing. The large and small particles correspond to triangulation number T = 4 and T = 3 dimer clustered packings, containing 240 and 180 protein subunits, respectively. The local packing of subunits is very similar in the two sizes of particle and shows holes or channels through the shell. The native viral core particle packages RNA and is active in reverse transcription to DNA. The holes we observe may provide access for the necessary small molecules. Shells assembled from the intact core protein contain additional material, probably RNA, which appears as an icosahedrally ordered inner shell in the three-dimensional map."
https://openalex.org/W2033417996,"The transcriptional activator interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) and its antagonistic repressor IRF-2 are regulators of the interferon (IFN) system and of cell growth. Here we report that embryonic fibroblasts (EFs) from mice with a null mutation in the IRF-1 gene (IRF-1-/- mice) can be transformed by expression of an activated c-Ha-ras oncogene. This property is not observed in EFs from wild-type or IRF-2-/- mice but is still observed in EFs from mice deficient in both genes. The transformed phenotype of ras-expressing IRF-1-/- EFs could be suppressed by the expression of the IRF-1 cDNA. Thus, IRF-1 functions as a tumor suppressor. Furthermore, expression of the c-Ha-ras oncogene causes wild-type but not IRF-1-/- EFs to undergo apoptosis when combined with a block to cell proliferation or treated by anticancer drugs or ionizing radiation. Hence, IRF-1 may be a critical determinant of oncogene-induced cell transformation or apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1984934120,"Arabidopsis COP1 acts as a repressor of photomorphogenesis in darkness, and light stimuli abrogate this suppressive action. COP1, when fused to beta-glucuronidase (GUS), is enriched in the nucleus in darkness, but not in the light, in hypocotyl cells of Arabidopsis seedlings and epidermal cells of onion bulbs. In Arabidopsis hypocotyl cells, the nuclear GUS-COP1 level changes in response to dark-light transitions and quantitatively correlates with the extent of repression of photomorphogenic development. In root cells, GUS-COP1 is constitutively nuclear, consistent with an established role of COP1 in suppressing root chloroplast development in both light and darkness. We conclude that COP1 acts inside the nucleus to suppress photomorphogenesis and that light inactivation of COP1 involves a cell type-specific control of its nucleocytoplasmic partitioning."
https://openalex.org/W2021345837,"Differentiation of somites into sclerotome, dermatome, and myotome is controlled by a complex set of inductive interactions. The ability of axial midline tissues, the notochord and floor plate, to induce sclerotome has been well documented and has led to models in which ventral somite identity is specified by signals derived from the notochord and floor plate. Herein, we provide evidence that Sonic hedgehog, a vertebrate homolog of the Drosophila segment polarity gene hedgehog, is a signal produced by the notochord and floor plate that directs ventral somite differentiation. Sonic hedgehog is expressed in ventral midline tissues at critical times during somite specification and has the ability, when ectopically expressed, to enhance the formation of sclerotome and antagonize the development of dermatome."
https://openalex.org/W2052595458,"Staufen protein is required in order to anchor bicoid (bcd) mRNA at the anterior pole of the Drosophila egg. Here we show that staufen protein colocalizes with bcd mRNA at the anterior, and that this localization depends upon its association with the mRNA. Upon injection into the embryo, bcd transcripts specifically interact with staufen, and we have mapped the sequences required to three regions of the 3'UTR, each of which is predicted to form a long stem-loop. The resulting staufen-bcd 3'UTR complexes form particles that show a microtubule-dependent localization. Since staufen is also transported with oskar (osk) mRNA during oogenesis, staufen associates specifically with both osk and bcd mRNAs to mediate their localizations, but at two distinct stages of development."
https://openalex.org/W2087732988,"KIN28, a member of the p34cdc2/CDC28 family of protein kinases, is identified as a subunit of yeast RNA polymerase transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) on the basis of sequence determination, immunological reactivity, and copurification. KIN28 is, moreover, one of three subunits of TFIIK, a subassembly of TFIIH with protein kinase activity directed toward the C-terminal repeat domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II. Itself a phosphoprotein, KIN28 interacts specifically with the two largest subunits of RNA polymerase II. Previous work of others points to two further associations: KIN28 interacts in vivo with the cyclin CCL1, and KIN28 and CCL1 are homologous to human MO15 and cyclin H, which form the cyclin-dependent kinaseactivating kinase (CAK). We show that human CAK possesses the CTD kinase activity characteristic of TFIIH."
https://openalex.org/W1976852696,"During development of T lymphocytes, differential regulation of expression of the CD4 and CD8 glycoproteins is coupled to the choice of one of two pathways of differentiation. Thymocytes that express both of these coreceptors commit to either the helper lineage, shutting off CD8, or the cytotoxic lineage, shutting off CD4. We have used transgenic mice to identify an intronic regulatory region that controls CD4 gene expression during development. This region selectively extinguishes transgene expression in CD4-CD8+, but not CD4+CD8- nor CD4+CD8+ T cells. It also represses gene expression in CD4-CD8- immature thymocytes, indicating that the CD4 gene is derepressed during differentiation from the CD4-CD8- to the CD4+CD8+ stage. The negative element(s) is both orientation and position independent and acts also on heterologous regulatory sequences. Its properties are functionally similar to those of silencers described in yeast and in Drosophila, suggesting that we have identified a developmentally regulated vertebrate transcriptional silencer."
https://openalex.org/W2130234511,"Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypoKPP) is an autosomal dominant skeletal muscle disorder manifested by episodic weakness associated with low serum potassium. Genetic linkage analysis has localized the hypoKPP gene to chromosome 1q31â€“q32 near a dihydropyridine (DHP) receptor gene. This receptor functions as a voltage-gated calcium channel and is also critical for excitation-contraction coupling in a voltage-sensitive and calcium-independent manner. We have characterized patient-specific DHP receptor mutations in 11 probands of 33 independent hypoKPP kindreds that occur at one of two adjacent nucleotides within the same codon and predict substitution of a highly conserved arginine in the S4 segment of domain 4 with either histidine or glycine. In one kindred, the mutation arose de novo. Taken together, these data establish this DHP receptor as the hypoKPP gene. We are unaware of any other human diseases presently known to result from DHP receptor mutations."
https://openalex.org/W1632132781,"Little is known about the biochemical mechanisms responsible for the biological aging process. Our previous results and those of others suggest that one possible mechanism is based on the loss of glutathione (GSH), a multifunctional tripeptide present in high concentrations in nearly all living cells. The recent finding that life-long dietary restriction of the GSH precursor methionine (Met) resulted in increased longevity in rats led us to hypothesize that adaptive changes in Met and GSH metabolism had occurred, leading to enhanced GSH status. To test this, blood and tissue GSH levels were measured at different ages throughout the life span in F344 rats on control or Met-restricted diets. Met restriction resulted in a 42% increase in mean and 44% increase in maximum life span, and in 43% lower body weight compared to controls (P < 0.001). Increases in blood GSH levels of 81% and 164% were observed in mature and old Met-restricted animals, respectively (P < 0.001). Liver was apparently the source for this increase as hepatic GSH levels decreased to 40% of controls. Except for a 25% decrease in kidney, GSH was unchanged in other tissues. All changes in GSH occurred as early as 2 months after the start of the diet. Altogether, these results suggest that dramatic adaptations in sulfur amino acid metabolism occur as a result of chronic Met restriction, leading to increases in blood GSH levels and conservation of tissue GSH during aging."
https://openalex.org/W2069309932,"The brain mesoaccumbens dopamine system is intricately involved in the psychomotor stimulant activities of cocaine. However, the extent to which different dopamine receptors mediate these effects has not yet been firmly established. The present study used dopamine D1 receptor mutant mice produced by gene targeting to investigate the role of this receptor in the effects induced by cocaine. In contrast with wild-type mice, which showed a dose-dependent increase in locomotion, D1 mutant mice exhibited a dose-dependent decrease. Electrophysiological studies of dopamine-sensitive nucleus accumbens neurons demonstrated a marked reduction in the inhibitory effects of cocaine on the generation of action potentials. In addition, the inhibitory effects of dopamine as well as D1 and D2 agonists were almost completely abolished, whereas those of serotonin were unaffected. D2-like dopamine receptor binding was also normal. These results demonstrate the essential role of the D1 receptor in the locomotor stimulant effects of cocaine and in dopamine-mediated neurophysiological effects within the nucleus accumbens."
https://openalex.org/W1997196594,"The initiation of sporulation in B. subtilis is regulated by the Spo0A transcription factor, which is activated by phosphorylation to control developmental switching from the vegetative to the sporulation state. The level of phosphorylation of Spo0A is regulated by the phosphorelay, a signal transduction system based on the protein-histidine kinase-response regulator two-component paradigm. To initiate sporulation, the cell must recognize and interpret a large variety of environmental, metabolic, and cell cycle signals that influence the phosphorylation level of Spo0A. We describe here a family of protein-aspartate phosphatases with activity on Spo0F approximately P, a response regulator component of the phosphorelay, that provide a mechanism for signal recognition and interpretation. These phosphatases function to drain the phosphorelay, lower Spo0A approximately P levels, and prevent sporulation. The integration of diverse environmental signals that affect the initiation of sporulation likely occurs through the competition between opposing activities of protein kinases and protein phosphatases."
https://openalex.org/W1502651723,"During early human pregnancy, fetal cytotrophoblasts rapidly invade the uterus. This process has many similarities to tumor invasion, except that the extent and the timing of cytotrophoblast invasion are carefully regulated. Therefore, this system is particularly useful for studying mechanisms that regulate invasive processes. Previously, we showed that production and activation of the 92-kDa type IV collagenase (matrix metalloproteinase(MMP)-9) is necessary for cytotrophoblast invasion in vitro. In other systems, interleukin (IL)-1 beta is an important regulator of matrix-degrading metalloproteinases. Therefore, we investigated trophoblast production of IL-1 beta and its receptors, as well as the effects of this cytokine on cytotrophoblast metalloproteinase activity and invasion. The results showed that release of IL-1 beta parallels the invasive potential of the cytotrophoblasts; the highest levels are produced by first trimester cells and the lowest levels by term cells. Immunoprecipitation showed that cytotrophoblasts express the 80-kDa type I IL-1 receptor, suggesting that autocrine effects are possible. IL-1 beta stimulated trophoblast MMP-9 secretion (by a mechanism that required nascent mRNA and protein synthesis) as well as metalloproteinase activity and invasion of Matrigel. Increasing (by lipopolysaccharide treatment) or decreasing (by glucocorticoid treatment) IL-1 beta production had parallel effects on MMP-9 secretion, metalloproteinase activity, and invasion. Because IL-1 beta and corticosteroids are present in high concentrations at the maternal-fetal interface, normal trophoblast invasion may be regulated, in part, by their opposing actions. In contrast, stimulation of cytotrophoblast IL-1 beta secretion by lipopolysaccharide may play a role in the sequela of infected fetal membranes."

https://openalex.org/W1994333666,"McLeod syndrome is an X-linked multisystem disorder characterized by abnormalities in the neuromuscular and hematopoietic systems. We have assembled a cosmid contig of 360 kb that encompasses the McLeod gene locus. A 50 kb deletion was detected by screening DNA from patients with radiolabeled whole cosmids, and two transcription units were identified within this deletion. The mRNA expression pattern of one of them, designated as XK, correlates closely to the McLeod phenotype. XK encodes a novel protein with structural characteristics of prokaryotic and eukaryotic membrane transport proteins. Nucleotide sequence analysis of XK from two unrelated McLeod patients has identified point mutations at conserved splice donor and acceptor sites. These findings provide direct evidence that XK is responsible for McLeod syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W1971291306,"During development of the C. elegans hermaphrodite gonad, two cells interact with each other, so that one chooses to become the anchor cell (AC) and the other becomes a ventral uterine precursor cell (VU). This interaction is mediated by the receptor LIN-12 and its apparent ligand LAG-2. We show that initially lin-12 and lag-2 are expressed in both cells, but prior to commitment, the expression patterns change in a reciprocal manner, so that lin-12 expression becomes restricted to the presumptive VU and lag-2 expression becomes restricted to the presumptive AC. In addition, lin-12 activity promotes expression of lin-12 and represses expression of lag-2. Furthermore, we show that positive autoregulation of lin-12 transcription in the presumptive VU is mediated by a cis-acting 5' regulatory sequence and is necessary to specify the VU fate. Our results suggest that transcriptional control is a component of the feedback mechanism involved in specifying the AC and VU fates."
https://openalex.org/W1714294326,"Recent evidence supports the concept that tumor growth in vivo depends on evasion of normal homeostatic control mechanisms that operate through induction of cell death by apoptosis. This study tested the hypothesis that a common property shared by known or suspected tumor promoters is the ability to block the process of apoptosis. A total of 10 tumor promoters were tested and all were found to inhibit DNA fragmentation and cell death of 7 different cell lines triggered into apoptosis by diverse agents. Resistance to apoptosis could be induced rapidly (within 1 h) by treating with relatively high concentrations of promoters. However, low physiological concentrations of promoters could also induce complete resistance to apoptosis after prolonged exposure (5-15 days of culture). Like tumor promotion in vivo, promoter-induced resistance to apoptosis was reversible after culturing in the absence of promoter. These findings provide new insight into the mechanism of tumor promotion and suggest a novel in vitro screening assay to detect new tumor-promoting agents in the environment."
https://openalex.org/W1971396838,"We find that mRNA synthesized within the Xenopus oocyte nucleus is translated with an efficiency 50 times less than that of mRNA injected into the oocyte cytoplasm. For histone H1 mRNA this effect is independent of mRNA splicing, nuclear export, and the promoter driving transcription. The mRNA synthesized in vivo is translationally competent but is masked from the translational machinery in the cytoplasm through association with proteins including frog Y-box protein 2 (FRGY2). We find that overexpression of FRGY2 facilitates the translational repression of mRNA synthesized within Xenopus oocytes. The requirement for transcription to occur in vivo before a translationally repressed state can be established suggests that these two events are functionally coupled in Xenopus oocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1524615273,"Regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II in eukaryotic cells requires both basal and accessory factors, which interact through specific protein-DNA or protein-protein interactions. The high mobility group 1 protein (HMG1) was previously demonstrated to be a nonhistone chromatin-associated protein, which selectively recognizes cruciform DNA rather than a specific primary sequence element. During our investigations of proteins that interact with TFIID, we found that purified mammalian HMG1, as well as recombinant human HMG1, can interact with TATA-binding protein (TBP) in the presence of a TATA box-containing oligonucleotide to form a specific HMG1.TBP.promoter complex. This complex prevents TFIIB binding to TBP and consequently blocks formation of the preinitiation complex. In contrast, TFIIA can compete with HMG1 for binding to TBP. In an in vitro transcription assay reconstituted with highly purified or recombinant general factors, HMG1 is able to inhibit transcription by RNA polymerase II over 30-fold. As expected, addition of TFIIA can partially reverse this repression in a concentration-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that HMG1, a chromatin-associated protein, has the potential to act as a TBP-dependent negative transcription factor and may provide an important link between chromatin structure and the modulation of class II gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1962029512,"Bile acid synthesis from cholesterol can occur via two pathways, one initiated by sterol 27-hydroxylase activity or one initiated by that of cholesterol 7Î±-hydroxylase. In contrast to cholesterol 7Î±-hydroxylase, which is found in the liver, sterol 27-hydroxylase is a widely distributed mitochondrial enzyme with high activity in vascular endothelial cells. Although both pathways lead to the production of chenodeoxycholic and cholic acids, the key step, 7Î±-hydroxylation, is governed by two different enzymes. Both 27-hydroxycholesterol and 3Î²-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid, the metabolites of cholesterol occurring via sterol 27-hydroxylase activity, normally circulate in plasma. After their uptake by the liver they are metabolized mostly to chenodeoxycholic acid, which down-regulates the activity of cholesterol 7Î± -hydroxylase, the rate-limiting step for the production of bile acids in the liver. Because of this relationship and also in view of the accelerated atherosclerosis and cholesterol deposition in tissues that occur as a consequence of genetically determined sterol 27-hydroxylase deficiency and of the potent biologic effect of 27-hydroxycholesterol in cell culture, it is proposed that this metabolic pathway serves a regulatory function. The pathway beginning with cholesterol 7Î±-hydroxylation is modulated by genetic, hormonal, and probably dietary factors, and becomes most prominent with the interruption of the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids.â€”Javitt, N.

https://openalex.org/W1606045266,"We report that a non-neuronal cell line, MIN6, derived from insulin-secreting pancreatic beta-cells, naturally expresses functional ionotropic glutamate receptors. Electrophysiological recordings show that kainate, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA), and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) depolarize single MIN6 cells and evoke inward ionic currents. These agents also increase the intracellular calcium concentration in MIN6 cells. Furthermore, insulin secretion from MIN6 cells is stimulated by kainate, AMPA, and NMDA. The presence of AMPA/kainate and NMDA receptor subtypes is confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. These results demonstrate that ionotropic glutamate receptors with properties similar to those in neuronal cells are expressed in a non-neuronal cell line, MIN6. Thus, MIN6 provides a useful and valuable model system for biochemical, pharmacological, and physiological studies of ionotropic glutamate receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2137582988,"It is demonstrated in this report that purified E2A helix-loop-helix (HLH) proteins spontaneously form homodimers that are linked by an intermolecular disulfide bond. These homodimers bind DNA at physiological temperatures but fail to associate with either Id or MyoD. When the disulfide bond is reduced by an activity present in muscle cell lysates or disrupted by site-directed mutagenesis, the monomeric form of the protein is strongly favored at 37Â°C. These E2A monomers cannot bind DNA but heterodimerize efficiently with Id and MyoD. It is also shown that an intermolecular disulfide bond cross-links E2A homodimers in B cells but not in muscle cells in which only heterodimers have been detected. These results suggest a novel mechanism for regulating the dimerization status and DNA binding properties of E2A HLH transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W1493781700,"Hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha (HNF-1 alpha) and HNF-1 beta are transcription factors that contain a divergent homeodomain, bind to DNA as homo- or heterodimers, and act to regulate transcription of many genes that are expressed primarily in liver. We show that HNF-1 alpha and HNF-1 beta act as regulatory factors for transcription of sucrase-isomaltase (SI), the gene for which is expressed exclusively in absorptive enterocytes of the small intestine. HNF-1 alpha and HNF-1 beta bind to two evolutionarily conserved sites in the SI promoter, previously named SIF2 and SIF3, with different relative affinities. HNF-1 alpha binds to the SIF3 element with greater affinity than to the SIF2 element, whereas HNF-1 beta binds to both elements equally. Co-transfection experiments demonstrated that HNF-1 alpha is able to increase transcriptional initiation from a minimal SI intestine-specific promoter. In contrast, HNF-1 beta has no functional effect on transcription of the SI promoter. The functional and DNA binding differences of HNF-1 alpha and HNF-1 beta on elements in the SI promoter suggest that these transcription factors may play a role in the complex spatial patterns of SI gene expression in the intestine."
https://openalex.org/W1606739417,"Herpes simplex viruses (HSV) use multiple and sequential receptors to enter host cells. HSV glycoprotein D (gD) has been implicated in binding to cellular receptors that facilitate virus penetration into cells. We used soluble forms of gD that were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells to characterize and identify a putative cellular receptor for HSV as the 275-kDa mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptor. Soluble gD also bound to the 46-kDa cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) receptor and was extensively modified with Man-6-P residues on its Asn-linked oligosaccharides. Additionally, soluble gD was a high affinity substrate for N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase, the first enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway for the addition of Man-6-P residues to lysosomal enzymes. The membrane form of gD immunoprecipitated from HSV-infected cells also bound to the 275-kDa mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptor, albeit poorly, and only a small fraction of the membrane gD was modified with Man-6-P. Notwithstanding this low level of mannose phosphorylation, the interaction between gD and Man-6-P receptors may play a role in some aspect of virus entry or egress."
https://openalex.org/W1568043918,"The catalytic zinc ion of astacin, a prototypical metalloproteinase from crayfish, has been substituted by Co(II), Cu(II), Hg(II), and Ni(II) in order to probe the role of the metal for both catalysis and structure. Compared to Zn(II)-astacin, Co(II)- and Cu(II)-astacin display enzymatic activities of about 140 and 37%, respectively, while Ni(II)- and Hg(II)-astacin are almost inactive. The electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum of Cu(II)-astacin is typical of 5-fold coordinated copper(II), and its intense absorption maxima at 445 and 325 nm are probably due to ligand-metal charge-transfer transitions involving Tyr-149. This residue had been identified previously by x-ray crystallography of the zinc enzyme as a zinc ligand, in addition to three imidazoles and a glutamic acid-bound water molecule. We present now the refined high-resolution x-ray crystal structures of Cu(II)-, Co(II)-, and Ni(II)-astacin, which exhibit a virtually identical protein framework to the previously analyzed structures of Zn(II)-, apo-, and Hg(II)-astacin. In Co(II)- and Cu(II)-astacin, the metal is penta-coordinated similarly to the native zinc enzyme. In the Ni(II) derivative, however, an additional solvent molecule expands the metal coordination sphere to a distorted octahedral ligand geometry, while in Hg(II)-astacin, no ordered solvent molecule at all is observed in the inner coordination sphere of the metal. This indicates a close correlation between catalytic properties and ground-state metal coordination of astacin."
https://openalex.org/W1480477818,"The in vitro replication of DNA containing the bovine papillomavirus (BPV-1) origin has been carried out with cell-free extracts from mouse FM3A and human HeLa cells. DNA synthesis required the E1 protein, the minimal origin of replication (nucleotides 7911-22 of the BPV-1 genome), and, at low levels of FM3A extract, the addition of the human single-stranded DNA-binding protein (also called RP-A or RF-A). The E2 protein was not absolutely required, but could stimulate DNA synthesis at low levels of E1. DNA synthesis was also reconstituted using purified proteins from HeLa cells. These protein factors included human single-stranded DNA-binding protein, topoisomerase I, and DNA polymerase (pol) alpha-primase complex. At low concentrations of pol alpha-primase complex, the formation of high molecular weight products was dependent on the addition of DNA polymerase delta holoenzyme containing proliferating cell nuclear antigen and activator 1, also called RF-C. We have overexpressed and isolated the E1 protein from bacteria. This protein also supported BPV DNA synthesis, both in crude extracts and with purified proteins suggesting that E1 phosphorylation is not required for BPV DNA replication in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1530777988,"Many non-Hodgkins B-cell lymphomas possess a deregulated bcl-2 gene resulting in a phenotype that is apparently resistant to programmed cell death (apoptosis). We have used a mouse lymphoma cell line (S49.1) that undergoes apoptosis in response to a variety of stimuli to determine the effect of bcl-2 expression on induction of apoptosis. S49 cells were stably transfected with recombinant amphotrophic retroviruses carrying either a G418 antibiotic resistance gene alone (S49-NEO) or this gene in combination with a bcl-2 complementary DNA (S49-Bcl-2). Three different agents previously shown to activate apoptosis by different pathways in S49 cells (dexamethasone, the calcium ionophore A23187, and cycloheximide) were used to examine the effect of bcl-2 expression on cell growth and apoptosis caused by multiple signal transduction pathways. Dexamethasone (DEX) treatment inhibited cell growth and stimulated cell death in S49-NEO cells. Although S49-Bcl-2 cells exhibited a similar antiproliferative response, they failed to die in response to steroid treatment. Western blot analysis revealed no difference in the levels of glucocorticoid receptor protein in the two cell lines, and both responded to glucocorticoid with a profound inhibition of protein synthesis. Cycloheximide (CX) and A23187 also had antiproliferative and cell killing effects in both cell types, although higher concentrations of each agent were needed to kill S49-Bcl-2 cells. To determine whether the loss of viability in response to these drugs was due to apoptosis, cells were examined morphologically and DNA integrity was examined by gel electrophoresis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W2004545538,"The wingless protein is secreted, but it is not known whether it acts only on cells near to its site of synthesis or whether it has a longer range. Here, we use mosaic Drosophila embryos to estimate the range of wingless as it acts to maintain expression of the engrailed gene. We find that expression of engrailed is often sustained in those wingless- cells that are located near a wildtype patch of tissue, but this is not invariably so. Also, the numbers of cells maintaining engrailed expression are small. From these findings, we argue that wingless-expressing cells sustain engrailed expression only in adjoining cells. The wingless gene is also needed for maintenance of its own expression; using mosaics, we find that the range of this action is short as well."
https://openalex.org/W1480657691,"An Escherichia coli expression system has been developed for pea cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase (APX). The enzyme was expressed as a fusion product with the E. coli maltose-binding protein for rapid, affinity chromatography purification. Recombinant ascorbate peroxidase (rAPX) was purified by tryptic digestion to separate the maltose-binding protein from rAPX followed by three chromatographic steps. The purified rAPX protein demonstrated identical electrophoretic, enzymatic, and spectral properties when compared to native APX isolated from pea shoots. Upon addition of an equal molar amount of H2O2, rAPX exhibits an initial decrease in the Soret maximum, which slowly converts to a stable, red-shifted Soret peak similar to that observed for cytochrome c peroxidase Compound I, indicating that rAPX Compound I consists of an oxyferryl (Fe(4+)-O) center. rAPX has been crystallized in a form suitable for crystal structure determination, and a preliminary set of native data to 2.6 A have been collected."
https://openalex.org/W1672106329,"A stepwise increase in extracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]o) can evoke insulin release from pancreatic islets in the absence of secretagogues. We have investigated the ionic mechanism underlying this secretory response by recording intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) from single mouse islets of Langerhans using ratiometric fura-2 microfluorometry. In the presence of 11 mM glucose, the [Ca2+]i undergoes fast oscillations associated with bursting electrical activity. Nifedipine (10 microM) suppressed these oscillations and markedly lowered the [Ca2+]i. Raising the [Ca2+]o from 2.56 to 12.8 mM in the continued presence of 11 mM glucose and nifedipine evoked pronounced [Ca2+]i rises of variable amplitude and time course. This effect was dose-dependent (EC50 = 3.6 mM) and remained essentially unchanged in the absence of glucose or in the presence of 3 mM glucose and nifedipine, conditions where beta-cells are hyperpolarized by approximately -25 mV. Depleting the acetylcholine-mobilizable internal Ca2+ pools by repetitively challenging the islets with acetylcholine in the absence of Ca2+ actually potentiated the standard high Ca2+ responses. The latter were strongly reduced by millimolar concentrations of Ni2+ (70% reduction at 3 mM) and by diphenylamine-2-carboxylate (DPC; IC50 = 145 microM), a blocker of nonselective cation channels. The standard high Ca2+ responses were relatively insensitive to the glycolytic inhibitor mannoheptulose. It is proposed that the high Ca(2+)-evoked [Ca2+]i responses are primarily accounted for by Ca2+ influx through dihydropyridine- and voltage-insensitive, nonselective cation channels. These channels do not appear to be under the control of glucose metabolism. Although their function is unknown, they may be essential to supplying the beta-cells with Ca2+ in the absence of stimulatory levels of fuel secretagogues."
https://openalex.org/W1841509396,"The binding of sugars and antibiotics to the overexpressed D-galactose-H+ symport protein (GalP) can be monitored from changes in the fluorescence of 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate (ANS) equilibrated with inside-out vesicles. Transported sugars, such as D-glucose and D-galactose, cause an enhancement in the ANS fluorescence of up to 13%. Nontransported sugars that have little, if any, affinity for GalP, such as L-galactose and L-glucose, have no effect upon the ANS fluorescence. Cytochalasin B and forskolin, which are potent inhibitors of the transporter, produce little change in the fluorescence, but are capable of reversing the D-galactose/D-glucose enhancement in fluorescence. Sugars that bind to GalP but are not transported, such as methyl-beta-D-glucose, produce only a slight quench in the ANS fluorescence, but again reverse the enhancement in fluorescence induced by transported sugars. A simple interpretation is that the increase in ANS fluorescence is attributable to the sugar-induced reorientation of the transporter from an inward- to an outward-facing conformation. Nontransported sugars and antibiotics, which are thought to bind at the inner membrane face of the transporter, are able to reverse the fluorescence enhancement by binding to the inward-facing conformation. The postulated reorientation process was sufficiently slow to follow its progress by stopped-flow fluorometry. The Kd for the binding of D-galactose to the inward-facing site was 7.22 (+/- 1.49) mM, and the rate constants for outward and inward reorientation of the transporter were 4.06 (+/- 0.16) s-1 and 1.36 (+/- 0.18) s-1, respectively. The overall Kd values for a range of sugars and antibiotics have been determined, and the involvement of each sugar hydroxyl group in the recognition and translocation processes has been assessed."
https://openalex.org/W1607454277,"A conformational change was detected in reovirus upon its attachment to mouse L fibroblasts. Specifically, the capsid proteins of cell-bound virions became more resistant to pepsin digestion. Similar observations were made using glutaraldehyde-fixed cells or plasma membranes instead of live cells, indicating that virus internalization was not necessary for this effect. This conformational change was totally reversible, since bound virions reverted back to the pepsin-sensitive state upon release from the cell surface. Not unexpectedly, a conformational change was also detected in the reovirus cell attachment protein sigma 1 when it alone bound to cells. The alteration was mapped, by deletion mutagenesis, to a region proximal to the N-terminal (virion-anchoring) end of the protein and was also found to be reversible. Structural changes in sigma 1 were also detectable following its interaction with sialic acid (conjugated to bovine serum albumin) shown previously to the minimal receptor determinant recognized by reovirus. These results suggest that upon cell attachment, a signal is transmitted from the C-terminal receptor-binding region of sigma 1 to the N terminus in a ripple-like progression that eventually leads to conformational changes in the other reovirus capsid proteins. An altered conformational state may be necessary for subsequent viral entry and programmed disassembly of viral capsids inside susceptible cells."
https://openalex.org/W1599006702,"Achromobacter protease I is a lysine-specific serine protease that Achromobacter lyticus M497-1 extracellularly secretes. The structural aspects necessary for the protease to function were investigated by means of site-directed mutagenesis to identify the constituents of the catalytic triad and the amino acid residue responsible for lysine specificity. The precursor molecules, which were produced by substitution of His-57, Asp-113, or Ser-194 for alanine, could not be converted to the mature form. In contrast, a precursor of a mutant in which either His-56 or Ser-193 is converted to alanine was perfectly processed autocatalytically and attained full protease activity. Substitution of Glu-190, one of the two candidates for determining lysine specificity, to glutamine, aspartic acid, or leucine had no or little effect on both proteolytic activity and substrate specificity. However, the kinetic parameters were subtly different from one another, depending on the nature of substituents in these mutants. The substitution of the other candidate, Asp-225, for asparagine or leucine resulted in the failure of maturation to the active forms. However, the precursor of the D225E mutant slowly matured and was essentially inactive. The observed reduction of protease activity is largely due to a decrease in the affinity of lysine to the protease. These results suggest that His-57, Asp-113, and Ser-194 are the three constituents of the catalytic triad in Achromobacter protease I and that Asp-225 plays a critical role in restricted substrate specificity as a lysyl endopeptidase."
https://openalex.org/W2246065619,"Abstract Glucocorticoids inhibit transcription of the proto-oncogene c-myc in lymphoid cells of thymic origin. To determine if this effect is associated with changes in the properties of the transcription factor E2F, extracts were prepared from control and glucocorticoid-treated P1798 murine T lymphoma cells, and the macromolecular state of E2F was assessed by gel-mobility shift. Control extracts exhibit two predominant gel-mobility shift entities of which one corresponds to free E2F. A second entity, complex C, has properties similar to those described for the complex containing E2F, p107, cyclin A, and Cdk2. Complex C disappears after addition of dexamethasone and is replaced by complex D. The mobility of this complex and its sensitivity to SV40 T antigen suggest that complex D corresponds to an E2F-p105Rb-1 complex. Extracts from control and glucocorticoid-treated cells yield identical DNase I protection patterns on the c-myc P2 promoter. Furthermore, such extracts transcribe the c-myc P2 promoter in vitro with equal activity. The relative abundance of the E2F complexes was measured after addition of dexamethasone. Complex C disappears as cells withdraw from S phase, and complex D appears at this time. The genes encoding thymidine kinase (Tk-1) and p34cdc2 (cdc2) are regulated with kinetics similar to those observed for changes in the macromolecular state of E2F. However, regulation of c-myc expression occurs long before any change in E2F. The macromolecular state of E2F may regulate expression of genes at the G1/S boundary. However, the data are not consistent with the hypothesis that association of E2F with tumor suppressor gene products such as p107 or p105Rb-1 is relevant to glucocorticoid regulation of c-myc transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1487439087,"Streptolysin O-permeable pancreatic acini, which retain intact signaling systems, were used to study the regulation of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins-1,4,5-P3)-activated Ca2+ channel during agonist stimulation and antagonist inhibition. Stimulation of permeable cells with carbachol induced rapid Ca2+ release from internal stores. Addition of heparin prior to or after agonist stimulation inhibited the release, indicating the activation of the Ins-1,4,5-P3-dependent Ca2+ channels by the agonist. Termination of cell stimulation with the specific antagonist atropine rapidly inactivated the release channels. Channel inactivation by the antagonist was independent of Ins-1,4,5-P3 levels since (a) addition of atropine to carbachol-stimulated cells resulted in a slow hydrolysis of Ins-1,4,5-P3, (b) addition of 10-fold excess Ins-1,4,5-P3 together with the agonist did not prevent channel inactivation by the antagonist, and (c) the antagonist inactivated Ca2+ release in the presence of saturating concentration of the nonhydrolyzable Ins-2,4,5-P3. Hence, the antagonist appears to stabilize the Ins-1,4,5-P3-activated Ca2+ channel in a state refractory to Ins-1,4,5-P3. These findings are the first direct evidence that the channel can exist in such a refractory state."
