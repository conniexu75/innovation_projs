https://openalex.org/W3183254943,"PD-1 blockade unleashes CD8 T cells1, including those specific for mutation-associated neoantigens (MANA), but factors in the tumour microenvironment can inhibit these T cell responses. Single-cell transcriptomics have revealed global T cell dysfunction programs in tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). However, the majority of TIL do not recognize tumour antigens2, and little is known about transcriptional programs of MANA-specific TIL. Here, we identify MANA-specific T cell clones using the MANA functional expansion of specific T cells assay3 in neoadjuvant anti-PD-1-treated non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). We use their T cell receptors as a 'barcode' to track and analyse their transcriptional programs in the tumour microenvironment using coupled single-cell RNA sequencing and T cell receptor sequencing. We find both MANA- and virus-specific clones in TIL, regardless of response, and MANA-, influenza- and Epstein-Barr virus-specific TIL each have unique transcriptional programs. Despite exposure to cognate antigen, MANA-specific TIL express an incompletely activated cytolytic program. MANA-specific CD8 T cells have hallmark transcriptional programs of tissue-resident memory (TRM) cells, but low levels of interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R) and are functionally less responsive to interleukin-7 (IL-7) compared with influenza-specific TRM cells. Compared with those from responding tumours, MANA-specific clones from non-responding tumours express T cell receptors with markedly lower ligand-dependent signalling, are largely confined to HOBIThigh TRM subsets, and coordinately upregulate checkpoints, killer inhibitory receptors and inhibitors of T cell activation. These findings provide important insights for overcoming resistance to PD-1 blockade."
https://openalex.org/W3184584468,"Interactions between T cell receptors (TCRs) and their cognate tumour antigens are central to antitumour immune responses1-3; however, the relationship between phenotypic characteristics and TCR properties is not well elucidated. Here we show, by linking the antigenic specificity of TCRs and the cellular phenotype of melanoma-infiltrating lymphocytes at single-cell resolution, that tumour specificity shapes the expression state of intratumoural CD8+ T cells. Non-tumour-reactive T cells were enriched for viral specificities and exhibited a non-exhausted memory phenotype, whereas melanoma-reactive lymphocytes predominantly displayed an exhausted state that encompassed diverse levels of differentiation but rarely acquired memory properties. These exhausted phenotypes were observed both among clonotypes specific for public overexpressed melanoma antigens (shared across different tumours) or personal neoantigens (specific for each tumour). The recognition of such tumour antigens was provided by TCRs with avidities inversely related to the abundance of cognate targets in melanoma cells and proportional to the binding affinity of peptide-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complexes. The persistence of TCR clonotypes in peripheral blood was negatively affected by the level of intratumoural exhaustion, and increased in patients with a poor response to immune checkpoint blockade, consistent with chronic stimulation mediated by residual tumour antigens. By revealing how the quality and quantity of tumour antigens drive the features of T cell responses within the tumour microenvironment, we gain insights into the properties of the anti-melanoma TCR repertoire."
https://openalex.org/W3186520869,"The process of pyroptosis is mediated by inflammasomes and a downstream effector known as gasdermin D (GSDMD). Upon cleavage by inflammasome-associated caspases, the N-terminal domain of GSDMD forms membrane pores that promote cytolysis. Numerous proteins promote GSDMD cleavage, but none are known to be required for pore formation after GSDMD cleavage. Herein, we report a forward genetic screen that identified the Ragulator-Rag complex as being necessary for GSDMD pore formation and pyroptosis in macrophages. Mechanistic analysis revealed that Ragulator-Rag is not required for GSDMD cleavage upon inflammasome activation but rather promotes GSDMD oligomerization in the plasma membrane. Defects in GSDMD oligomerization and pore formation can be rescued by mitochondrial poisons that stimulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and ROS modulation impacts the ability of inflammasome pathways to promote pore formation downstream of GSDMD cleavage. These findings reveal an unexpected link between key regulators of immunity (inflammasome-GSDMD) and metabolism (Ragulator-Rag)."
https://openalex.org/W3186127064,"Moiré quantum matter has emerged as a materials platform in which correlated and topological phases can be explored with unprecedented control. Among them, magic-angle systems constructed from two or three layers of graphene have shown robust superconducting phases with unconventional characteristics1-5. However, direct evidence of unconventional pairing remains to be experimentally demonstrated. Here we show that magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene exhibits superconductivity up to in-plane magnetic fields in excess of 10 T, which represents a large (2-3 times) violation of the Pauli limit for conventional spin-singlet superconductors6,7. This is an unexpected observation for a system that is not predicted to have strong spin-orbit coupling. The Pauli-limit violation is observed over the entire superconducting phase, which indicates that it is not related to a possible pseudogap phase with large superconducting amplitude pairing. Notably, we observe re-entrant superconductivity at large magnetic fields, which is present over a narrower range of carrier densities and displacement fields. These findings suggest that the superconductivity in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene is likely to be driven by a mechanism that results in non-spin-singlet Cooper pairs, and that the external magnetic field can cause transitions between phases with potentially different order parameters. Our results demonstrate the richness of moiré superconductivity and could lead to the design of next-generation exotic quantum matter."

https://openalex.org/W3185602476,"Nearly 50 years ago, Intel created the world’s first commercially produced microprocessor—the 4004 (ref. 1), a modest 4-bit CPU (central processing unit) with 2,300 transistors fabricated using 10 μm process technology in silicon and capable only of simple arithmetic calculations. Since this ground-breaking achievement, there has been continuous technological development with increasing sophistication to the stage where state-of-the-art silicon 64-bit microprocessors now have 30 billion transistors (for example, the AWS Graviton2 (ref. 2) microprocessor, fabricated using 7 nm process technology). The microprocessor is now so embedded within our culture that it has become a meta-invention—that is, it is a tool that allows other inventions to be realized, most recently enabling the big data analysis needed for a COVID-19 vaccine to be developed in record time. Here we report a 32-bit Arm (a reduced instruction set computing (RISC) architecture) microprocessor developed with metal-oxide thin-film transistor technology on a flexible substrate (which we call the PlasticARM). Separate from the mainstream semiconductor industry, flexible electronics operate within a domain that seamlessly integrates with everyday objects through a combination of ultrathin form factor, conformability, extreme low cost and potential for mass-scale production. PlasticARM pioneers the embedding of billions of low-cost, ultrathin microprocessors into everyday objects. Flexible electronic platforms would enable the integration of functional electronic circuitry with many everyday objects; here, a low-cost and fully flexible 32-bit microprocessor is produced."
https://openalex.org/W3184849231,"Whereas ferromagnets have been known and used for millennia, antiferromagnets were only discovered in the 1930s1. At large scale, because of the absence of global magnetization, antiferromagnets may seem to behave like any non-magnetic material. At the microscopic level, however, the opposite alignment of spins forms a rich internal structure. In topological antiferromagnets, this internal structure leads to the possibility that the property known as the Berry phase can acquire distinct spatial textures2,3. Here we study this possibility in an antiferromagnetic axion insulator-even-layered, two-dimensional MnBi2Te4-in which spatial degrees of freedom correspond to different layers. We observe a type of Hall effect-the layer Hall effect-in which electrons from the top and bottom layers spontaneously deflect in opposite directions. Specifically, under zero electric field, even-layered MnBi2Te4 shows no anomalous Hall effect. However, applying an electric field leads to the emergence of a large, layer-polarized anomalous Hall effect of about 0.5e2/h (where e is the electron charge and h is Planck's constant). This layer Hall effect uncovers an unusual layer-locked Berry curvature, which serves to characterize the axion insulator state. Moreover, we find that the layer-locked Berry curvature can be manipulated by the axion field formed from the dot product of the electric and magnetic field vectors. Our results offer new pathways to detect and manipulate the internal spatial structure of fully compensated topological antiferromagnets4-9. The layer-locked Berry curvature represents a first step towards spatial engineering of the Berry phase through effects such as layer-specific moiré potential."
https://openalex.org/W3186674199,"The classic mode of STING activation is through binding the cyclic dinucleotide 2'3'-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), produced by the DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), which is important for the innate immune response to microbial infection and autoimmune disease. Modes of STING activation that are independent of cGAS are much less well understood. Here, through a spatiotemporally resolved proximity labelling screen followed by quantitative proteomics, we identify the lysosomal membrane protein Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) as a cofactor in the trafficking of STING. NPC1 interacts with STING and recruits it to the lysosome for degradation in both human and mouse cells. Notably, we find that knockout of Npc1 'primes' STING signalling by physically linking or 'tethering' STING to SREBP2 trafficking. Loss of NPC1 protein also 'boosts' STING signalling by blocking lysosomal degradation. Both priming and boosting of STING signalling are required for severe neurological disease in the Npc1-/- mouse. Genetic deletion of Sting1 (the gene that encodes STING) or Irf3, but not that of Cgas, significantly reduced the activation of microglia and relieved the loss of Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum of Npc1-/- mice, leading to improved motor function. Our study identifies a cGAS- and cGAMP-independent mode of STING activation that affects neuropathology and provides a therapeutic target for the treatment of Niemann-Pick disease type C."

https://openalex.org/W3183290118,"Since its discovery, the deep-sea glass sponge Euplectella aspergillum has attracted interest in its mechanical properties and beauty. Its skeletal system is composed of amorphous hydrated silica and is arranged in a highly regular and hierarchical cylindrical lattice that begets exceptional flexibility and resilience to damage. Structural analyses dominate the literature, but hydrodynamic fields that surround and penetrate the sponge have remained largely unexplored. Here we address an unanswered question: whether, besides improving its mechanical properties, the skeletal motifs of E. aspergillum underlie the optimization of the flow physics within and beyond its body cavity. We use extreme flow simulations based on the 'lattice Boltzmann' method, featuring over fifty billion grid points and spanning four spatial decades. These in silico experiments reproduce the hydrodynamic conditions on the deep-sea floor where E. aspergillum lives. Our results indicate that the skeletal motifs reduce the overall hydrodynamic stress and support coherent internal recirculation patterns at low flow velocity. These patterns are arguably beneficial to the organism for selective filter feeding and sexual reproduction11,12. The present study reveals mechanisms of extraordinary adaptation to live in the abyss, paving the way towards further studies of this type at the intersection between fluid mechanics, organism biology and functional ecology."
https://openalex.org/W3182428057,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic underscores the need to better understand animal-to-human transmission of coronaviruses and adaptive evolution within new hosts. We scanned more than 182,000 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes for selective sweep signatures and found a distinct footprint of positive selection located around a non-synonymous change (A1114G; T372A) within the spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), predicted to remove glycosylation and increase binding to human ACE2 (hACE2), the cellular receptor. This change is present in all human SARS-CoV-2 sequences but not in closely related viruses from bats and pangolins. As predicted, T372A RBD bound hACE2 with higher affinity in experimental binding assays. We engineered the reversion mutant (A372T) and found that A372 (wild-type [WT]-SARS-CoV-2) enhanced replication in human lung cells relative to its putative ancestral variant (T372), an effect that was 20 times greater than the well-known D614G mutation. Our findings suggest that this mutation likely contributed to SARS-CoV-2 emergence from animal reservoirs or enabled sustained human-to-human transmission."
https://openalex.org/W3183755809,"In early mitosis, the duplicated chromosomes are held together by the ring-shaped cohesin complex1. Separation of chromosomes during anaphase is triggered by separase-a large cysteine endopeptidase that cleaves the cohesin subunit SCC1 (also known as RAD212-4). Separase is activated by degradation of its inhibitors, securin5 and cyclin B6, but the molecular mechanisms of separase regulation are not clear. Here we used cryogenic electron microscopy to determine the structures of human separase in complex with either securin or CDK1-cyclin B1-CKS1. In both complexes, separase is inhibited by pseudosubstrate motifs that block substrate binding at the catalytic site and at nearby docking sites. As in Caenorhabditis elegans7 and yeast8, human securin contains its own pseudosubstrate motifs. By contrast, CDK1-cyclin B1 inhibits separase by deploying pseudosubstrate motifs from intrinsically disordered loops in separase itself. One autoinhibitory loop is oriented by CDK1-cyclin B1 to block the catalytic sites of both separase and CDK19,10. Another autoinhibitory loop blocks substrate docking in a cleft adjacent to the separase catalytic site. A third separase loop contains a phosphoserine6 that promotes complex assembly by binding to a conserved phosphate-binding pocket in cyclin B1. Our study reveals the diverse array of mechanisms by which securin and CDK1-cyclin B1 bind and inhibit separase, providing the molecular basis for the robust control of chromosome segregation."
https://openalex.org/W3186639722,"Background Food insecurity is a serious social and public health problem which is exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic especially in resource-poor countries such as Nepal. However, there is a paucity of evidence at local levels. This study aims to explore food insecurity among people from the disadvantaged community and low-income families during the COVID-19 pandemic in Province-2 of Nepal. Methods The semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted virtually among purposively selected participants (n = 41) from both urban and rural areas in eight districts of Province 2 in Nepal. All the interviews were conducted in the local language between July and August 2020. The data analysis was performed using thematic network analysis in Nvivo 12 Pro software. Results The results of this study are grouped into four global themes: i) Impact of COVID-19 on food security; ii) Food insecurity and coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic, iii) Food relief and emergency support during the COVID-19 pandemic, and iv) Impact of COVID-19 and food insecurity on health and wellbeing. Most participants in the study expressed that families from low socioeconomic backgrounds and disadvantaged communities such as those working on daily wages and who rely on remittance had experienced increased food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants used different forms of coping strategies to meet their food requirements during the pandemic. Community members experienced favouritism, nepotism, and partiality from local politicians and authorities during the distribution of food relief. The food insecurity among low-income and disadvantaged families has affected their health and wellbeing making them increasingly vulnerable to the COVID-19 infection. Conclusion Food insecurity among low-income and disadvantaged families was found to be a serious problem during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study suggests that the relief support plan and policies should be focused on the implementation of immediate sustainable food security strategies to prevent hunger, malnutrition, and mental health problems among the most vulnerable groups in the community."
https://openalex.org/W3184609118,"Infection-induced aversion against enteropathogens is a conserved sickness behaviour that can promote host survival1,2. The aetiology of this behaviour remains poorly understood, but studies in Drosophila have linked olfactory and gustatory perception to avoidance behaviours against toxic microorganisms3-5. Whether and how enteric infections directly influence sensory perception to induce or modulate such behaviours remains unknown. Here we show that enteropathogen infection in Drosophila can modulate olfaction through metabolic reprogramming of ensheathing glia of the antennal lobe. Infection-induced unpaired cytokine expression in the intestine activates JAK-STAT signalling in ensheathing glia, inducing the expression of glial monocarboxylate transporters and the apolipoprotein glial lazarillo (GLaz), and affecting metabolic coupling of glia and neurons at the antennal lobe. This modulates olfactory discrimination, promotes the avoidance of bacteria-laced food and increases fly survival. Although transient in young flies, gut-induced metabolic reprogramming of ensheathing glia becomes constitutive in old flies owing to age-related intestinal inflammation, which contributes to an age-related decline in olfactory discrimination. Our findings identify adaptive glial metabolic reprogramming by gut-derived cytokines as a mechanism that causes lasting changes in a sensory system in ageing flies."
https://openalex.org/W3184606332,"Globally, there is an increasing occurrence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Enterobacteriaceae with extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) and/or plasmid-encoded AmpC (pAmpC) β-lactamases in clinical and environmental settings of significant concern. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the occurrence of ESBL/pAmpC genetic determinants, and some essential non-β-lactam genetic determinants in the MDR phenotypic antimicrobial resistance in Enterobacteriaceae isolates recovered from hospital wastewater. We collected samples from two hospitals in Amathole and Chris Hani District Municipalities in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa, within October and November 2017. Using the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF), we identified a total of 44 presumptive Enterobacteriaceae isolates. From this, 31 were identified as the targeted Enterobacteriaceae members. Thirty-six percent of these belonged to Klebsiella oxytoca, while 29% were Klebsiella pneumoniae. The other identified isolates included Citrobacter freundii and Escherichia coli (10%), Enterobacter asburiae (6%), Enterobacter amnigenus, Enterobacter hormaechei, and Enterobacter kobei (3%). We established the antibiotic susceptibility profiles of these identified bacterial isolates against a panel of 18 selected antibiotics belonging to 11 classes were established following established guidelines by the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute. All the bacterial species exhibited resistance phenotypically against at least four antibiotic classes and were classified as MDR. Notably, all the bacterial species displayed resistance against cefotaxime, ampicillin, nalidixic acid, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The generated multiple antibiotic resistance indices ranged between 0.5 to 1.0, with the highest value seen in one K. oxytoca isolated. Molecular characterization via the Polymerase Chain Reaction uncovered various ESBLs, pAmpCs, and other non-β-lactam encoding genes. Of the phenotypically resistant isolates screened for each class of antibiotics, the ESBLs detected were blaCTX-M group (including groups 1, 2, and 9) [51.6% (16/31)], blaTEM [32.3% (10/31)], blaOXA-1-like [19.4% (6/31)], blaSHV [12.9% (4/31)], blaPER [6.5% (2/31)], blaVEB [3.2% (1/31)], blaOXA-48-like and blaVIM [15.4% (2/13)], and blaIMP [7.7% (1/13)]. The pAmpC resistance determinants detected were blaCIT [12.9% (4/31)], blaFOX [9.7% (3/31)], blaEBC [6.5% (2/31)], and blaDHA [3.2% (1/31)]. The frequencies of the non-β-lactam genes detected were catII [79.2% (19/24)], tetA [46.7% (14/30)], sulI and sulII [35.5% (11/31)], tetB [23.3% (7/30)], aadA [12.9% (4/31)], tetC [10% (3/30)], and tetD [3.3% (1/30)]. These results indicate that hospital wastewater is laden with potentially pathogenic MDR Enterobacteriaceae with various antibiotic resistance genes that can be spread to humans throughout the food chain, provided the wastewaters are not properly treated before eventual discharge into the environment."
https://openalex.org/W3184777642,"COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, which has significantly impacted economic and public healthcare systems worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is highly lethal in older adults (&gt;65 years old) and in cases with underlying medical conditions, including chronic respiratory diseases, immunosuppression, and cardio-metabolic diseases, including severe obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. The course of the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico has led to many fatal cases in younger patients attributable to cardio-metabolic conditions. Thus, in the present study, we aimed to perform an early spatial epidemiological analysis for the COVID-19 outbreak in Mexico. Firstly, to evaluate how mortality risk from COVID-19 among tested individuals (MRt) is geographically distributed and secondly, to analyze the association of spatial predictors of MRt across different states in Mexico, controlling for the severity of the disease. Among health-related variables, diabetes and obesity were positively associated with COVID-19 fatality. When analyzing Mexico as a whole, we identified that both the percentages of external and internal migration had positive associations with early COVID-19 mortality risk with external migration having the second-highest positive association. As an indirect measure of urbanicity, population density, and overcrowding in households, the physicians-to-population ratio has the highest positive association with MRt. In contrast, the percentage of individuals in the age group between 10 to 39 years had a negative association with MRt. Geographically, Quintana Roo, Baja California, Chihuahua, and Tabasco (until April 2020) had higher MRt and standardized mortality ratios, suggesting that risks in these states were above what was nationally expected. Additionally, the strength of the association between some spatial predictors and the COVID-19 fatality risk varied by zone."

https://openalex.org/W3184856083,"Mexico has experienced one of the highest COVID-19 mortality rates in the world. A delayed implementation of social distancing interventions in late March 2020 and a phased reopening of the country in June 2020 has facilitated sustained disease transmission in the region. In this study we systematically generate and compare 30-day ahead forecasts using previously validated growth models based on mortality trends from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation for Mexico and Mexico City in near real-time. Moreover, we estimate reproduction numbers for SARS-CoV-2 based on the methods that rely on genomic data as well as case incidence data. Subsequently, functional data analysis techniques are utilized to analyze the shapes of COVID-19 growth rate curves at the state level to characterize the spatiotemporal transmission patterns of SARS-CoV-2. The early estimates of the reproduction number for Mexico were estimated between Rt ~1.1-1.3 from the genomic and case incidence data. Moreover, the mean estimate of Rt has fluctuated around ~1.0 from late July till end of September 2020. The spatial analysis characterizes the state-level dynamics of COVID-19 into four groups with distinct epidemic trajectories based on epidemic growth rates. Our results show that the sequential mortality forecasts from the GLM and Richards model predict a downward trend in the number of deaths for all thirteen forecast periods for Mexico and Mexico City. However, the sub-epidemic and IHME models perform better predicting a more realistic stable trajectory of COVID-19 mortality trends for the last three forecast periods (09/21-10/21, 09/28-10/27, 09/28-10/27) for Mexico and Mexico City. Our findings indicate that phenomenological models are useful tools for short-term epidemic forecasting albeit forecasts need to be interpreted with caution given the dynamic implementation and lifting of social distancing measures."
https://openalex.org/W3184224289,"Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been unclear how vulnerable people with HIV (PwH) are to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We sought to determine if PwH are more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 than people without HIV, and to identify risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity among PwH. We conducted a cross-sectional study in which we collected electronic medical record data for all patients who underwent SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing at an academic medical center. Presence of HIV and other chronic diseases were based on the presence of ICD-10 diagnosis codes. We calculated the percent positivity for SARS-CoV-2 among PwH and among people without HIV. Among PwH, we compared demographic factors, comorbidities, HIV viral load, CD4 T-cell count, and antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens between those who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and those who tested negative. Comparisons were made using chi squared tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Multivariate models were created using logistic regression. Among 69,763 people tested for SARS-CoV-2, 0.6% (431) were PwH. PwH were not significantly more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 than people without HIV (7.2% (31/431) vs 8.4% (5820/69763), p = 0.35), but were more likely to be younger, Black, and male (p-values &lt; .0001). There were no significant differences in HIV clinical factors, chronic diseases, or ART regimens among PwH testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 versus those testing negative. In our sample, PwH were not more likely to contract SARS-CoV-2, despite being more likely to be members of demographic groups known to be at higher risk for infection. Differences between PwH who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and those who tested negative were only seen in Hispanic/Latino ethnicity (non-Hispanic or Latino vs unknown Hispanic or Latino ethnicity (OR 0.2 95% CI (0.6, 0.9)) and site of testing(inpatient vs outpatient OR 3.1 95% CI (1.3, 7.4))."
https://openalex.org/W3184023943,"Epidemiologic studies in diabetic patients as well as research in model organisms have indicated the potential of metformin as a drug candidate for the treatment of various types of cancer, including breast cancer. To date most of the anti-cancer properties of metformin have, in large part, been attributed either to the inhibition of mitochondrial NADH oxidase complex (Complex I in the electron transport chain) or the activation of AMP-activated kinase (AMPK). However, it is becoming increasingly clear that AMPK activation may be critical to alleviate metabolic and energetic stresses associated with tumor progression suggesting that it may, in fact, attenuate the toxicity of metformin instead of promoting it. Here, we demonstrate that AMPK opposes the detrimental effects of mitochondrial complex I inhibition by enhancing glycolysis at the expense of, and in a manner dependent on, pyruvate availability. We also found that metformin forces cells to rewire their metabolic grid in a manner that depends on AMPK, with AMPK-competent cells upregulating glycolysis and AMPK-deficient cell resorting to ketogenesis. In fact, while the killing effects of metformin were largely rescued by pyruvate in AMPKcompetent cells, AMPK-deficient cells required instead acetoacetate, a product of fatty acid catabolism indicating a switch from sugar to fatty acid metabolism as a central resource for ATP production in these cells. In summary, our results indicate that AMPK activation is not responsible for metformin anticancer activity and may instead alleviate energetic stress by activating glycolysis."
https://openalex.org/W3183599907,"An additive genetic model is usually employed in case-control-based genome-wide association studies. The model usually encodes ""AA"", ""Aa"" and ""aa"" (""a"" represents the minor allele) as three different numbers, implying the contribution of genotype ""Aa"" to the phenotype is different from ""AA"" and ""aa"". From the perspective of biological phenomena, the coding is reasonable since the phenotypes of lives are not ""black and white"". A case-control based study, however, has only two phenotypes, case and control, which means that the phenotypes are ""black and white"". It suggests that a recessive/dominant model may be an alternative to the additive model. In order to investigate whether the alternative is feasible, we conducted comparative experiments on several models used in those studies through chi-square test and logistic regression. Our simulation experiments demonstrate that a recessive model is better than the additive model. The area under the curve of the former has increased by 5% compared with the latter, the discrimination of identifying risk single nucleotide polymorphisms has been improved by 61%, and the precision has also reached 1.10 times that of the latter. Furthermore, the real data experiments show that the precision and area under the curve of the former are 16% and 20% higher than the latter respectively, and the area under the curve of dominant model of the former is 13% higher than the latter. The results indicate a recessive/dominant model may be an alternative to the additive model and suggest a new route for case-control-based studies."

This study developed and evaluated the performance of a low-cost urine self-sampling method for HPV-testing and explored the acceptability and feasibility of potential implementation of this alternative in routine screening.A series of sequential laboratory assays examined the impact of several pre-analytical conditions for obtaining DNA from urine and subsequent HPV detection. Initially, we assessed the effect of ethylaminediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as a DNA preservative examining several variables including EDTA concentration, specimen storage temperature, time between urine collection and DNA extraction, and first-morning micturition versus convenience sample collection. We further evaluated the agreement of HPV-testing between urine and clinician-collected cervical samples among 95 women. Finally, we explored the costs of self-sampling supplies as well as the acceptability and feasibility of urine self-sampling among women and healthcare workers.Our results revealed higher DNA concentrations were obtained when using a 40mM EDTA solution, storing specimens at 25°C and extracting DNA within 72 hrs. of urine collection, regardless of using first-morning micturition or a convenience sampling. We observed good agreement (Kappa = 0.72) between urine and clinician-collected cervical samples for HPV detection. Furthermore, urine self-sampling was an affordable method (USD 1.10), well accepted among cervical cancer screening users, healthcare workers, and decision-makers.These results suggest urine self-sampling is feasible and appropriate alternative for HPV-testing in HPV-based screening programs in lower-resource contexts."
https://openalex.org/W3183346940,"Climate change is projected to have significant effects on the distribution of species globally, but research into the implications in parts of Africa has been limited. Using species distribution modelling, this study models climate change-related risks to the terrestrial biodiversity (birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians and plants) of Kenya's economically-important and ecologically diverse Tana River Basin. Large reductions in species richness are projected with just 2°C warming (relative to preindustrial levels) with birds and plants seeing the greatest impact. Potential climate refugia for biodiversity are identified within the basin, but often overlap with areas already converted to agriculture or set aside for agricultural expansion, and the majority are outside protected areas. Similarly, some protected areas contain no projected refugia at higher levels of global warming, showing they may be insufficient to protect the basin's biodiversity as climate changes. However, risks to biodiversity are much smaller if the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 'well below 2°C' warming, rather than 2°C only, is met. The potential for refugia for plants and animals decreases strongly with warming. For example, 82% of the basin remaining climatically suitable for at least 75% of the plants currently present at 1.5°C warming, as compared with 23% at 2°C and 3% at 4.5°C. This research provides the first assessment of the combined effects of development plans and climate change on biodiversity of the Tana River Basin, including identifying potential areas for restoration, and contributes to a greater understanding of biodiversity protection and adaptation options in Kenya."
https://openalex.org/W3184936058,"Tuberculosis (TB) incidence in Los Angeles County, California, USA (5.7 per 100,000) is significantly higher than the U.S. national average (2.9 per 100,000). Directly observed therapy (DOT) is the preferred strategy for active TB treatment but requires substantial resources. We partnered with the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (LACDPH) to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of AiCure, an artificial intelligence (AI) platform that allows for automated treatment monitoring.We used a Markov model to compare DOT versus AiCure for active TB treatment in LA County. Each cohort transitioned between health states at rates estimated using data from a pilot study for AiCure (N = 43) and comparable historical controls for DOT (N = 71). We estimated total costs (2017, USD) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over a 16-month horizon to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and net monetary benefits (NMB) of AiCure. To assess robustness, we conducted deterministic (DSA) and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA).For the average patient, AiCure was dominant over DOT. DOT treatment cost $4,894 and generated 1.03 QALYs over 16-months. AiCure treatment cost $2,668 for 1.05 QALYs. At willingness-to-pay threshold of $150K/QALY, incremental NMB per-patient under AiCure was $4,973. In univariate DSA, NMB were most sensitive to monthly doses and vocational nurse wage; however, AiCure remained dominant. In PSA, AiCure was dominant in 93.5% of 10,000 simulations (cost-effective in 96.4%).AiCure for treatment of active TB is cost-effective for patients in LA County, California. Increased use of AI platforms in other jurisdictions could facilitate the CDC's vision of TB elimination."
https://openalex.org/W3183658118,"In this paper, we propose an automatic cell counting framework for stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) images, which can assist tumor tissue characteristic analysis, cancer diagnosis, and surgery planning processes. SRS microscopy has promoted tumor diagnosis and surgery by mapping lipids and proteins from fresh specimens and conducting a fast disclose of fundamental diagnostic hallmarks of tumors with a high resolution. However, cell counting from label-free SRS images has been challenging due to the limited contrast of cells and tissue, along with the heterogeneity of tissue morphology and biochemical compositions. To this end, a deep learning-based cell counting scheme is proposed by modifying and applying U-Net, an effective medical image semantic segmentation model that uses a small number of training samples. The distance transform and watershed segmentation algorithms are also implemented to yield the cell instance segmentation and cell counting results. By performing cell counting on SRS images of real human brain tumor specimens, promising cell counting results are obtained with > 98% of area under the curve (AUC) and R = 0.97 in terms of cell counting correlation between SRS and histological images with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. The proposed cell counting scheme illustrates the possibility and potential of performing cell counting automatically in near real time and encourages the study of applying deep learning techniques in biomedical and pathological image analyses."
https://openalex.org/W3186198670,"Spiders being one of the most diverse group in phylum arthropod are of great importance due to their role as predators, silk producer, and in medicinal applications. Spiders in prey-predator relationships play a crucial role in balancing the food-chain of any ecosystem; therefore it is essential to characterize the gut microbiota of spiders collected from natural environments. In the present work, the largest effort so far has been made to characterize the gut microbiota of 35 spider species belonging to four different families using 16S amplicon targeting sequencing. Further, we compared the gut microbiota composition including endosymbiont abundance in spider species collected from different geographical locations. The results obtained revealed the presence of genera like Acinetobacter (15%), V7clade (9%), Wolbachia (8%), Pseudomonas (5%), Bacillus (6%). Although comparative analysis revealed that the gut bacterial composition in all the spider families has a similar pattern, in terms of community richness and evenness. The bacterial diversity in the spider family, Lycosidae are more diverse than in Salticidae, Tetragnathidae and Araneidae. Furthermore, it was observed that the abundance of endosymbiont genera, i.e. Wolbachia and Rickettsia, leads to shift in the abundance of other bacterial taxa and may cause sexual alterations in spider species. Moreover, predicted functional analysis based on PICRUSt2 reveals that gut microbiota of spider species were involved in functions like metabolism of carbohydrates, cofactors and vitamins, amino acids; biosynthesis of organic compounds, fatty acids, lipids etc. Based on the results obtained, it can be said that different locations do not correlate with community composition of gut microbiota in spider species collected from natural environments."
https://openalex.org/W3186537567,"Microcystis is a bloom-forming genus of cyanobacteria with some genotypes that produce highly toxic microcystin hepatotoxins. In waterbodies where biological and physical factors are relatively homogenous, toxin quotas (the average amount of toxin per cell), at a single point in time, are expected to be relatively constant. In this study we challenged this assumption by investigating the spatial distribution of microcystin quotas at a single point in time on two separate occasions in a lake with a major Microcystis bloom. Microcystis cell concentrations varied widely across the lake on both sampling occasions (730- and 137-fold) together with microcystin quotas (148- and 362-fold). Cell concentrations and microcystin quotas were strongly positively correlated (R2 = 0.89, P < 0.001, n = 28; R2 = 0.67, P < 0.001, n = 25). Analysis of Microcystis strains using high-throughput sequencing of the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region showed no relationship between microcystin quota and the relative abundance of specific sequences. Collectively, the results of this study indicate an association between microcystin production and cell density that magnifies the potential for bloom toxicity at elevated cell concentrations."

https://openalex.org/W3185355085,"As global research into recreational fishing gains momentum due to the pursuit's biological, social and economic impacts, information on regional and temporal patterns of recreational exploitation will continue to enable objective assessment and development of management initiatives for exploited species. This paper demonstrates the utility of offsite survey methods in assessing spatial and temporal differences in recorded catches from a large, diffuse and heterogenous coastal recreational fishery. Using the estuarine recreational fishery that operates along the coast of New South Wales, Australia as a case study, survey data was employed to quantify annual (June 2013-May 2014) state-wide estuarine catch. Generalized linear mixed effects models were then applied to expanded catch estimates from surveyed households to examine the influence of zone and season on the kept and released numbers of snapper (Pagrus auratus), dusky flathead (Platycephalus fuscus) and bream (Acanthopagrus spp. complex comprised of A. butcheri, A. australis and their hybrids). For kept bream, significant differential seasonal effects were observed in all regions except the Mid-South Coast. For released bream, numbers were greatest in Sydney and during Summer and Winter. For kept snapper, the greatest harvest was recorded in the Mid-South Coast but season had no effect. Differential seasonal effects were found in each zone for released snapper. For kept dusky flathead, the greatest numbers were recorded in Sydney and the Mid-South Coast but season had no effect. We conclude by assessing some current spatial and temporal management initiatives in light of the uncovered patterns of recreational catch and consider the implications of these patterns in terms of future ecosystem-based management recommendations aimed at achieving ecological, social and economic sustainability in fisheries."
https://openalex.org/W3186011887,"To study the influence of different factors on the cracking effect of the liquid CO2 phase transition, the mechanics of coal rock crack extension based on liquid CO2 phase change blast loading were studied. Through the application of simulation software to analyze the influence of coal seam physical parameters (in situ stress, gas pressure, modulus of elasticity and strength of coal) and blasting parameters (fracturing pore size and peak pressure of detonation)on the effect of liquid CO2 phase change cracking, the simulation results showed that the cracking effect of liquid CO2 phase change was positively correlated with the changes in gas pressure, elastic modulus, fracture hole diameter and peak vent pressure, negatively correlated with the variation in situ stress and compressive strength, and nearly independent of the tensile strength. In addition, by using Gray correlation analysis to analyze the influence degree of six main factors on the cracking effect, the calculation results showed that the effect of blasting parameters was greater than that of physical parameters. The main controlling factor that affected the blasting effect was the peak pressure of blasting release. By conducting comparative engineering trials with different blasting parameters, the test results showed that the crack effect of the coal seam was positively correlated with the change in fracture hole diameter and peak venting pressure, which was consistent with the results obtained from the simulation. The experimental results and simulation results for the effective radius of coal seam fracturing were basically consistent, with the error between the two types of results falling below 10%. Therefore, the reliability of the blasting numerical model was verified. In summary, the research results provide theoretical guidance for applying and promoting liquid CO2 fracturing technology in coal mines."

However, there are no prior studies concerning lifestyle-related factors that influence adolescents' substance use behavior. Therefore, the present study investigated the prevalence of substance use and its associated sociodemographic and lifestyle-related risk factors among a total of 424 Bangladeshi high school-going adolescents through a structured questionnaire interview study. The survey questionnaire consisted of socio-demographics, lifestyle-related information, and substance use-related questions. For data analysis, descriptive and inferential statistics were performed using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Science) version 22.0, and a p-value of <0.05 determined statistical significance. Results showed that 21.2%, 14.4%, and 15.1% of the participants reported smoking, using a drug, and consuming alcohol, respectively, at least once during their lifespan; whereas the current (i.e., past-month) rates were reported to be 10.4%, 2.8%, and 3.1%, respectively. Overall, the current substance use risk factors were identified as being male, not being from science academic background, having less family influence on personal life, irregular teeth brushing, being smartphone users, using a smartphone for a longer time, and being late-night sleepers. From the list of identified risk factors of substance use, those that are modifiable may be targeted to evolve a prevention program to manage this problem in Bangladeshi adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W3186164866,"Small carnivores are of increasing conservation concern globally, including those formerly thought to be widespread and abundant. Three weasel species (Mustela nivalis, M. frenata, and M. erminea) are distributed across most of North America, yet several recent studies have reported difficulty detecting weasels within their historical range and several states have revised the status of weasels to that of species of conservation concern. To investigate the status and trends of weasels across the United States (US) and Canada, we analyzed four separate datasets: historical harvests, museum collections, citizen scientist observations (iNaturalist), and a recent US-wide trail camera survey. We observed 87-94% declines in weasel harvest across North America over the past 60 years. Declining trapper numbers and shifts in trapping practices likely partially explain the decline in harvest. Nonetheless, after accounting for trapper effort and pelt price, we still detected a significant decline in weasel harvest for 15 of 22 evaluated states and provinces. Comparisons of recent and historical museum and observational records suggest relatively consistent distributions for M. erminea, but a current range gap of >1000 km between two distinct populations of M. nivalis. We observed a dramatic drop-off in M. frenata records since 2000 in portions of its central, Great Lakes, and southern distribution, despite extensive sampling effort. In 2019, systematic trail camera surveys at 1509 sites in 50 US states detected weasels at 14 sites, all of which were above 40o latitude. While none of these datasets are individually conclusive, they collectively support the hypothesis that weasel populations have declined in North America and highlight the need for improved methods for detecting and monitoring weasels. By identifying population declines for small carnivores that were formerly abundant across North America, our findings echo recent calls to expand investigations into the conservation need of small carnivores globally."
https://openalex.org/W3187000636,"Background The objective of this study was to identify clinical risk factors for COVID-19 in a German outpatient fever clinic that allow distinction of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients from other patients with flu-like symptoms. Methods This is a retrospective, single-centre cohort study. Patients were included visiting the fever clinic from 4 th of April 2020 to 15 th of May 2020. Symptoms, comorbidities, and socio-demographic factors were recorded in a standardized fashion. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify risk factors of COVID-19, on the bases of those a model discrimination was assessed using area under the receiver operation curves (AUROC). Results The final analysis included 930 patients, of which 74 (8%) had COVID-19. Anosmia (OR 10.71; CI 6.07–18.9) and ageusia (OR 9.3; CI 5.36–16.12) were strongly associated with COVID-19. High-risk exposure (OR 12.20; CI 6.80–21.90), especially in the same household (OR 4.14; CI 1.28–13.33), was also correlated; the more household members, especially with flu-like symptoms, the higher the risk of COVID-19. Working in an essential workplace was also associated with COVID-19 (OR 2.35; CI 1.40–3.96), whereas smoking was inversely correlated (OR 0.19; CI 0.08–0.44). A model that considered risk factors like anosmia, ageusia, concomitant of symptomatic household members and smoking well discriminated COVID-19 patients from other patients with flu-like symptoms (AUROC 0.84). Conclusions We report a set of four readily available clinical parameters that allow the identification of high-risk individuals of COVID-19. Our study will not replace molecular testing but will help guide containment efforts while waiting for test results."
https://openalex.org/W3185185982,"In recent years, the Asian gall wasp Dryocosmus kuriphilus has invaded chestnut trees and significantly affected the Portuguese chestnut production. Studies in other countries, such as Japan or Italy, have shown that the parasitoid Torymus sinensis can successfully achieve biological control of D. kuriphilus. Mathematical models help us to understand the dynamics of the interaction between the pest D. kuriphilus and its parasitoid T. sinensis and, consequently, they can help to implement measures that enhance crop pest management. In this work, the evolution of the density of D. kuriphilus and T. sinensis across time and space is studied through the numerical solution of models that include parameters based on observations made in Portugal. Simultaneous releases of the parasitoid are simulated at various locations and at different times. The results indicate that, in the case of a small and homogeneous orchard, biological control can be effective, but, in the case of extensive domains, the pest control is much more difficult to achieve. In order for biological control to be efficient, it is necessary to implement, in each chestnut-producing region, a collective strategy based on the annual monitoring of infestation levels."
https://openalex.org/W3185527560,"The effect of temperature during host patch exploitation by parasitoids remains poorly understood, despite its importance on female reproductive success. Under laboratory conditions, we explored the behaviour of Anaphes listronoti, an egg parasitoid of the carrot weevil, Listronotus oregonensis, when foraging on a host patch at five temperatures. Temperature had a strong effect on the female tendency to exploit the patch: A. listronoti females parasitized more eggs at intermediate temperature (20 to 30°C) compared to those foraging at the extreme of the range (15.9°C and 32.8°C). However, there was no difference in offspring sex-ratio and clutch size between temperature treatments. Mechanisms of host acceptance within a patch differed between temperatures, especially at 32.8°C where females used ovipositor insertion rather than antennal contact to assess whether a host was already parasitized or not, suggesting that host handling and chemical cues detection were probably constrained at high temperature. Females spent less time on the host patch with increasing temperatures, but temperature had no effect on patch-leaving rules. Our results show that foraging A. listronoti females behave better than expected at sub-optimal temperatures, but worse than expected at supra-optimal temperatures. This could impair parasitoid performance under ongoing climate change."

Seventy-six children and adolescents with spastic CP (between 5 and 18 years of age), representing levels I to IV of the Gross Motor Function Classification System-Expanded & Revised version (GMFCS), were analyzed. Multiple linear regression analysis with forward stepwise selection was conducted to examine which determinants were related to self-care capability and performance. Independent variables were age, CP type, GMFCS, Manual Ability Classification System, Box and Block Test, and grip strength in the dominant and non-dominant hands. Dependent variables were scores for the PEDI Functional Skills Scale and the PEDI Caregiver Assistance Scale.Results of the multiple regression analysis showed that the PEDI Functional Skills scale scores were correlated with the Box and Block Test in the dominant hand and GMFCS (Adjusted R2 = 0.69). The PEDI Caregiver Assistance Scale scores were correlated with the Box and Block Test in the dominant hand, GMFCS, and age (adjusted R2 = 0.71).When considering self-care of children and adolescents with spastic CP, it is necessary to consider the evaluation of upper limb dysfunction in addition to GMFCS."

Assessments were performed non-invasively using the sniff inspiratory pressure test (SNIP) and surface electromyography, respectively. Methods Twenty-two subjects (10 men and 12 women) performed 10 sniff maneuvers in two different days: with and without diaphC instructions. For the SNIP test with diaphC, the subjects were instructed to perform intense activation of the diaphragm. The tests with the best SNIP values were used for analysis. Results The maneuver with diaphC when compared to the maneuver without diaphC exhibited significant lower values for: SNIP (p &lt;0.01), maximum relaxation rate (MRR) (p &lt;0.01), maximum rate of pressure development (MRPD) (p &lt;0.01), contraction times (CT) (p = 0.02) and electrical activity of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) (p &lt;0.01), scalene (SCL) (p = 0.01) and intercostal (CI) (p = 0.03) muscles. In addition, the decay constant (tau, τ) and relaxation time (½ RT) did not present any changes. Conclusion The diaphragmatic control performed during the SNIP test influences the inspiratory pressure and the contractile properties of inspiratory muscles. This occurs due to changes in the pattern of muscle recruitment, which change force velocity characteristics of the test. Thus, instruction on diaphC should be encouraged for better performance of the SNIP test and for evaluation targeting the diaphragm muscle activity."

Glomerular podocytes constitute the blood-urine barrier, and podocyte slit-diaphragm (SD), a modified tight junction, contributes to the glomerular permselectivity. Nephrin, KIRREL1, podocin, CD2AP, and TRPC6 are crucial members of the SD that interact with each other and contribute to the SD's structural and functional integrity. This study analyzed the distribution of these five essential SD proteins across the organisms for which the genome sequence is available. We found a diverse distribution of nephrin and KIRREL1 ranging from nematodes to higher vertebrates, whereas podocin, CD2AP, and TRPC6 are restricted to the vertebrates. Among invertebrates, nephrin and its orthologs consist of more immunoglobulin-3 domains, whereas in the vertebrates, CD80-like C2-set domains are predominant. In the case of KIRREL1 and its orthologs, more Ig domains were observed in invertebrates than vertebrates. Src Homology-3 (SH3) domain of CD2AP and SPFH domain of podocin are highly conserved among vertebrates. TRPC6 and its orthologs had conserved ankyrin repeats, TRP, and ion transport domains, except Chondrichthyes and Echinodermata, which do not possess the ankyrin repeats. Intrinsically unstructured regions (IURs) are conserved across the SD orthologs, suggesting IURs importance in the protein complexes that constitute the slit-diaphragm.

A total of 355 patients were recruited from outpatient clinics at a tertiary care hospital network. Plasma NT-proBNP levels were quantified using protein multiplex. There were 279 patients with both clinical and diagnostic features of PAD and 76 control patients without PAD (non-PAD cohort). Compared with non-PAD patients, median (IQR) NT-proBNP levels in PAD patients were significantly higher (225 ng/L (120-363) vs 285 ng/L (188-425), p- value = 0.001, respectively). Regression analysis demonstrated that NT-proBNP remained significantly higher in patients with PAD relative to non-PAD despite adjusting for age, sex, hypercholesterolemia, smoking and hypertension [odds ratio = 1.28 (1.07-1.54), p-value <0.05]. Subgroup analysis showed elevated NT-proBNP levels in patients with PAD regardless of prior history of CHF, CAD, diabetes and hypercholesteremia (p-value <0.05). Finally, spearmen's correlation analysis demonstrated a negative correlation between NT-proBNP and ABI (ρ = -0.242; p-value < 0.001). In conclusion, our data shows that patients with PAD in an ambulatory care setting have elevated levels of NT-proBNP compared to non-PAD patients in the absence of cardiac symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W3185083145,"Food reward is defined as the momentary value of a food to the individual at the time of ingestion and is characterised by two psychological processes-""liking"" and ""wanting"". We aimed to validate an age-appropriate food reward task to quantify implicit wanting of children from the GUSTO cohort (n = 430). At age 5 years, child appetitive traits and maternal feeding practices were reported by mothers via questionnaires. At age 6, a write-for-food task based on the child's preference for food or toy rewards was undertaken in laboratory conditions. Child BMI and skinfold measurements were taken at age 7. Convergent validity of the food reward task was assessed by associating with child appetitive traits, where enjoyment of food/food responsiveness (OR: 1.51; 95% CI: 1.06, 2.15) and emotional overeating (OR: 1.64; 95% CI: 1.09, 2.48) were positively associated with high food reward in children. Criterion validity was tested by associating with child BMI, however no significant relationships were observed. Multivariable logistic regression analysis with maternal feeding practices revealed that children whose mother tend to restrict unhealthy food (OR: 1.37; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.82) and girls whose mothers taught them about nutrition (OR: 2.09; 95% CI: 1.19, 3.67) were more likely to have high food reward. No further significant associations were observed between food reward, other appetitive traits and feeding practices. Despite the lack of association with child weight status, this study demonstrated the value of the write-for-food task to assess food reward in children and presented sex-specific associations with maternal feeding practices."
