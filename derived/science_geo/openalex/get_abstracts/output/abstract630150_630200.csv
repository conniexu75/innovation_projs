https://openalex.org/W2925056974,"The hippocampus is one of the most affected areas in Alzheimer’s disease (AD)1. Moreover, this structure hosts one of the most unique phenomena of the adult mammalian brain, namely, the addition of new neurons throughout life2. This process, called adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN), confers an unparalleled degree of plasticity to the entire hippocampal circuitry3,4. Nonetheless, direct evidence of AHN in humans has remained elusive. Thus, determining whether new neurons are continuously incorporated into the human dentate gyrus (DG) during physiological and pathological aging is a crucial question with outstanding therapeutic potential. By combining human brain samples obtained under tightly controlled conditions and state-of-the-art tissue processing methods, we identified thousands of immature neurons in the DG of neurologically healthy human subjects up to the ninth decade of life. These neurons exhibited variable degrees of maturation along differentiation stages of AHN. In sharp contrast, the number and maturation of these neurons progressively declined as AD advanced. These results demonstrate the persistence of AHN during both physiological and pathological aging in humans and provide evidence for impaired neurogenesis as a potentially relevant mechanism underlying memory deficits in AD that might be amenable to novel therapeutic strategies. Newborn neurons are continuously incorporated into the healthy adult human hippocampus up to the ninth decade of life. However, robust adult hippocampal neurogenesis sharply declines during the progression of Alzheimer’s disease."

Here we demonstrate an evolution of sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization (seqFISH+). We show that seqFISH+ can image mRNAs for 10,000 genes in single cells-with high accuracy and sub-diffraction-limit resolution-in the cortex, subventricular zone and olfactory bulb of mouse brain, using a standard confocal microscope. The transcriptome-level profiling of seqFISH+ allows unbiased identification of cell classes and their spatial organization in tissues. In addition, seqFISH+ reveals subcellular mRNA localization patterns in cells and ligand-receptor pairs across neighbouring cells. This technology demonstrates the ability to generate spatial cell atlases and to perform discovery-driven studies of biological processes in situ."
https://openalex.org/W2923636118,"Re-expression of the paralogous γ-globin genes (HBG1/2) could be a universal strategy to ameliorate the severe β-globin disorders sickle cell disease (SCD) and β-thalassemia by induction of fetal hemoglobin (HbF, α2γ2)1. Previously, we and others have shown that core sequences at the BCL11A erythroid enhancer are required for repression of HbF in adult-stage erythroid cells but are dispensable in non-erythroid cells2-6. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene modification has demonstrated variable efficiency, specificity, and persistence in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Here, we demonstrate that Cas9:sgRNA ribonucleoprotein (RNP)-mediated cleavage within a GATA1 binding site at the +58 BCL11A erythroid enhancer results in highly penetrant disruption of this motif, reduction of BCL11A expression, and induction of fetal γ-globin. We optimize conditions for selection-free on-target editing in patient-derived HSCs as a nearly complete reaction lacking detectable genotoxicity or deleterious impact on stem cell function. HSCs preferentially undergo non-homologous compared with microhomology-mediated end joining repair. Erythroid progeny of edited engrafting SCD HSCs express therapeutic levels of HbF and resist sickling, while those from patients with β-thalassemia show restored globin chain balance. Non-homologous end joining repair-based BCL11A enhancer editing approaching complete allelic disruption in HSCs is a practicable therapeutic strategy to produce durable HbF induction."

https://openalex.org/W2925106348,"Cell-based biosensors have great potential to detect various toxic and pathogenic contaminants in aqueous environments. However, frequently they cannot meet practical requirements due to insufficient sensing performance. To address this issue, we investigated a modular, cascaded signal amplifying methodology. We first tuned intracellular sensory receptor densities to increase sensitivity, and then engineered multi-layered transcriptional amplifiers to sequentially boost output expression level. We demonstrated these strategies by engineering ultrasensitive bacterial sensors for arsenic and mercury, and improved detection limit and output up to 5,000-fold and 750-fold, respectively. Coupled by leakage regulation approaches, we developed an encapsulated microbial sensor cell array for low-cost, portable and precise field monitoring, where the analyte can be readily quantified via displaying an easy-to-interpret volume bar-like pattern. The ultrasensitive signal amplifying methodology along with the background regulation and the sensing platform will be widely applicable to many other cell-based sensors, paving the way for their real-world applications."
https://openalex.org/W2925184855,"Transcriptomic imputation approaches combine eQTL reference panels with large-scale genotype data in order to test associations between disease and gene expression. These genic associations could elucidate signals in complex genome-wide association study (GWAS) loci and may disentangle the role of different tissues in disease development. We used the largest eQTL reference panel for the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) to create a set of gene expression predictors and demonstrate their utility. We applied DLPFC and 12 GTEx-brain predictors to 40,299 schizophrenia cases and 65,264 matched controls for a large transcriptomic imputation study of schizophrenia. We identified 413 genic associations across 13 brain regions. Stepwise conditioning identified 67 non-MHC genes, of which 14 did not fall within previous GWAS loci. We identified 36 significantly enriched pathways, including hexosaminidase-A deficiency, and multiple porphyric disorder pathways. We investigated developmental expression patterns among the 67 non-MHC genes and identified specific groups of pre- and postnatal expression."
https://openalex.org/W2922584262,"Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in SHANK2 are associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We generated cortical neurons from induced pluripotent stem cells derived from neurotypic and ASD-affected donors. We developed sparse coculture for connectivity assays where SHANK2 and control neurons were differentially labeled and sparsely seeded together on a lawn of unlabeled control neurons. We observed increases in dendrite length, dendrite complexity, synapse number, and frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents. These findings were phenocopied in gene-edited homozygous SHANK2 knockout cells and rescued by gene correction of an ASD SHANK2 mutation. Dendrite length increases were exacerbated by IGF1, TG003, or BDNF, and suppressed by DHPG treatment. The transcriptome in isogenic SHANK2 neurons was perturbed in synapse, plasticity, and neuronal morphogenesis gene sets and ASD gene modules, and activity-dependent dendrite extension was impaired. Our findings provide evidence for hyperconnectivity and altered transcriptome in SHANK2 neurons derived from ASD subjects."

Cells with this phenotype are also elevated in patients with systemic sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus, suggesting a way to characterize CD4+ T cells specific for disease-driving antigens in multiple autoimmune conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2951255200,"The network of grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) forms a fixed reference frame for mapping physical space. The mechanistic origin of the grid representation is unknown, but continuous attractor network models explain multiple fundamental features of grid cell activity. An untested prediction of these models is that the grid cell network should exhibit an activity correlation structure that transcends behavioral states. By recording from MEC cell ensembles during navigation and sleep, we found that spatial phase offsets of grid cells predict arousal-state-independent spike rate correlations. Similarly, state-invariant correlations between conjunctive grid-head direction and pure head direction cells were predicted by their head direction tuning offsets during awake behavior. Grid cells were only weakly correlated across grid modules, and module scale relationships disintegrated during slow-wave sleep, suggesting that grid modules function as independent attractor networks. Collectively, our observations imply that network states in MEC are expressed universally across brain and behavior states."
https://openalex.org/W2923360235,"Quantum mechanics places a fundamental limit on the precision of continuous measurements. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle dictates that as the precision of a measurement of an observable (for example, position) increases, back action creates increased uncertainty in the conjugate variable (for example, momentum). In interferometric gravitational-wave detectors, higher laser powers reduce the position uncertainty created by shot noise (the photon-counting error caused by the quantum nature of the laser) but necessarily do so at the expense of back action in the form of quantum radiation pressure noise (QRPN)1. Once at design sensitivity, the gravitational-wave detectors Advanced LIGO2, VIRGO3 and KAGRA4 will be limited by QRPN at frequencies between 10 hertz and 100 hertz. There exist several proposals to improve the sensitivity of gravitational-wave detectors by mitigating QRPN5–10, but until now no platform has allowed for experimental tests of these ideas. Here we present a broadband measurement of QRPN at room temperature at frequencies relevant to gravitational-wave detectors. The noise spectrum obtained shows effects due to QRPN between about 2 kilohertz and 100 kilohertz, and the measured magnitude of QRPN agrees with our model. We now have a testbed for studying techniques with which to mitigate quantum back action, such as variational readout and squeezed light injection7, with the aim of improving the sensitivity of future gravitational-wave detectors. Future gravitational-wave detectors are expected to be limited by quantum back action, which is now found in the audio band in a low-loss optomechanical system."
https://openalex.org/W2951002351,"Continuous-attractor network models of grid formation posit that recurrent connectivity between grid cells controls their patterns of co-activation. Grid cells from a common module exhibit stable offsets in their periodic spatial tuning curves across environments, and this may reflect recurrent connectivity or correlated sensory inputs. Here we explore whether cell-cell relationships predicted by attractor models persist during sleep states in which spatially informative sensory inputs are absent. We recorded ensembles of grid cells in superficial layers of medial entorhinal cortex during active exploratory behaviors and overnight sleep. Per grid cell pair and collectively, and across waking, rapid eye movement sleep and non-rapid eye movement sleep, we found preserved patterns of spike-time correlations that reflected the spatial tuning offsets between these grid cells during active exploration. The preservation of cell-cell relationships across waking and sleep states was not explained by theta oscillations or activity in hippocampal subregion CA1. These results indicate that recurrent connectivity within the grid cell network drives grid cell activity across behavioral states."
https://openalex.org/W2924784423,"Humans exhibit considerable variation in how they value their own interest relative to the interests of others. Deciphering the neural codes representing potential rewards for self and others is crucial for understanding social decision-making. Here we integrate computational modeling with functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the neural representation of social value and the modulation by oxytocin, a nine-amino acid neuropeptide, in participants evaluating monetary allocations to self and other (self-other allocations). We found that an individual's preferred self-other allocation serves as a reference point for computing the value of potential self-other allocations. In more prosocial participants, amygdala activity encoded a social-value-distance signal; that is, the value dissimilarity between potential and preferred allocations. Intranasal oxytocin administration amplified this amygdala representation and increased prosocial behavior in more individualistic participants but not in more prosocial ones. Our results reveal a neurocomputational mechanism underlying social-value representations and suggest that oxytocin may promote prosociality by modulating social-value representations in the amygdala."
https://openalex.org/W2924610085,"Background Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are rising in India resulting in major health system challenges. Methods Eighteen primary health centre (PHC) clusters in rural Andhra Pradesh were randomised over three, 6-month steps to an intervention comprising: (1) household CVD risk assessments by village-based community health workers (CHWs) using a mobile tablet device; (2) electronic referral and clinical decision support for PHC doctors; and (3) a tracking system for follow-up care. Independent data collectors screened people aged ≥ 40 years in 54 villages serviced by the PHCs to create a high CVD risk cohort (based on WHO risk charts and blood pressure thresholds). Randomly selected, independent samples, comprising 15% of this cohort, were reviewed at each 6-month step. The primary outcome was the proportion meeting systolic blood pressure (SBP) targets (<140mmHg). Findings Eight-four percent of the eligible population (n = 62,254) were assessed at baseline (18.4% at high CVD risk). Of those at high risk, 75.3% were followed up over two years. CHWs screened 85.9% of the baseline cohort and doctors followed up 70.0% of all high risk referrals. There was no difference in the proportion of people achieving SBP targets (41.2% vs 39.2%; adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.01 95% CI 0.76–1.35) or receiving BP-lowering medications in the intervention vs control periods respectively. There was a high discordance in risk scores generated by independent data collectors and CHWs, resulting in only 37.2% of the evaluation cohort exposed to the intervention. This discordance was mainly driven by fluctuating BP values (both normal variability and marked seasonal variations). In the pre-specified high risk concordant subgroup, there was greater use of BP-lowering medications in the intervention period (54.3% vs 47.9%, OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.03–1.44) but no impact on BP control. Conclusions The strategy was well implemented with increased treatment rates among high risk individuals assessed by CHWs, however effects on BP were not demonstrated. Use of guideline-recommended BP thresholds for identifying high risk individuals substantially affected the reproducibility of risk assessment, and thus the ability to reliably evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention. In addition, unanticipated seasonal variation in BP in the context of a stepped-wedge trial highlights the inherent risks of this study design.

https://openalex.org/W2924615783,"Epicoccum is a genus of ascomycetes often associated with the mycobiome of grapevines (Vitis vinifera). Epicoccum spp. are found in the soil, phyllosphere, as well as in the wood, where they interact both with the plant and with other endophytes and pathogens. Wood pathogens involved in the esca disease complex, a grapevine trunk disease, are particularly concerning in viticulture, as current control strategies have proven unsatisfactory. This study investigated the interaction among Epicoccum spp. and three esca-associated fungi, with the aim of establishing whether they are suitable candidates for biological control.A screening conducted in vitro, by means of dual culture, revealed that all tested Epicoccum spp. inhibited the growth of pathogens Phaeomoniella chlamydospora and Fomitiporia mediterranea, while only some of them inhibited Phaeoacremonium minimum. Epicoccum layuense E24, identified as the most efficient antagonist, was tested in rooted grapevine cuttings of cultivars Cabernet Sauvignon and Touriga Nacional, under greenhouse conditions, against P. chlamydospora and P. minimum. This study revealed that the inoculation of E. layuense E24 produced a successful colonization of the wood of grapevines; in addition it did not impair the growth of the plants or induce the appearance of symptoms in leaves or in wood. Moreover, grapevines colonized by E. layuense E24 showed a considerable decrease in the wood symptomatology caused by the inoculated pathogens (by 31–82%, depending on the pathogen/grapevine cultivar), as well as a reduction in their frequency of re-isolation (60–74%).Our findings suggest that E. layuense E24 is a promising candidate for its application in biological control, due to its antagonistic interaction with some esca-associated fungal pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2924372838,"Background Population trends of disease prevalence and incidence over time measure burden of disease and inform healthcare planning. Neuromuscular disorders (NMD) affect muscle and nerve function with varying degrees of severity and disease progression. Objective Using health administrative databases we described trends in incidence, prevalence, and mortality of adults and children with NMD. We also explored place of death and use of palliative care. Methods Population-based (Ontario, Canada) cohort study (2003 to 2014) of adults and children with NMD identified using International Classification of Disease and health insurance billing codes within administrative health databases. Results Adult disease prevalence increased on average per year by 8% (95% confidence interval (CI) 6% to 10%, P <.001), with the largest increase in adults18-39 years. Childhood disease prevalence increased by 10% (95% CI 8% to 11%, P <.0001) per year, with the largest increase in children 0 to 5 years. Prevalence increased across all diagnoses except amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy for adults and all diagnoses for children. Adult incidence decreased by 3% (95% CI -4% to -2%, P <.0001) but incidence remained stable in children. Death occurred in 34,336 (18.5%) adults; 21,236 (61.8%) of whom received palliative care. Death occurred in 1,009 (5.6%) children; 507 (50.2%) of whom received palliative care. Mortality decreased over time in adults (odds ratio (OR) 0.86, 95% CI 0.86–0.87, P <.0001) and children (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.76–0.82, P <.0001). Use of palliative care over time increased for adults (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.28, P <.0001) and children (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.23, P <.0001). Conclusions In both adults and children, NMD prevalence is rising and mortality rates are declining. In adults incidence is decreasing while in children it remains stable. This confirms on a population-based level the increased survival of children and adults with NMD."
https://openalex.org/W2923073161,"Background In Spain, women invited to breast screening are not usually informed about potential harms of screening. The objective of the InforMa study is to assess the effect of receiving information about the benefits and harms of breast screening on informed choice and other decision-making outcomes, in women approaching the age of invitation to mammography screening. Methods Two-stage randomised controlled trial. In the first stage, 40 elementary territorial units of the public healthcare system were selected and randomised to intervention or control. In the second stage, women aged 49-50 years were randomly selected. The target sample size was 400 women. Women in the intervention arm received a decision aid (DA) with detailed information on the benefits and harms of screening. Women in the control arm received a standard leaflet that did not mention harms and recommended accepting the invitation to participate in the Breast Cancer Screening Program (BCSP). The primary outcome was informed choice, defined as adequate knowledge and intentions consistent with attitudes. Secondary outcomes included decisional conflict, worry about breast cancer, time perspective, opinions about the DA or the leaflet, and participation in the BCSP. Results In the intervention group, 23.2% of 203 women made an informed choice compared to only 0.5% of 197 women in the control group (p < 0.001). Attitudes and intentions were similar in both study groups with a high frequency of women intending to be screened, 82.8% vs 82.2% (p = 0.893). Decisional conflict was significantly lower in the intervention group. No differences were observed in confidence in the decision, anxiety, and participation in BCSP. Conclusions Women in Spain lack knowledge on the benefits and harms of breast screening. Providing quantitative information on benefits and harms has produced a considerable increase in knowledge and informed choice, with a high acceptance of the informative materials.

https://openalex.org/W2924944897,"Phenotypic screening has identified small-molecule modulators of aging, but the mechanism of compound action often remains opaque due to the complexities of mapping protein targets in whole organisms. Here, we combine a library of covalent inhibitors with activity-based protein profiling to coordinately discover bioactive compounds and protein targets that extend lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans. We identify JZL184—an inhibitor of the mammalian endocannabinoid (eCB) hydrolase monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL or MGLL)—as a potent inducer of longevity, a result that was initially perplexing as C. elegans does not possess an MAGL ortholog. We instead identify FAAH-4 as a principal target of JZL184 and show that this enzyme, despite lacking homology with MAGL, performs the equivalent metabolic function of degrading eCB-related monoacylglycerides in C. elegans. Small-molecule phenotypic screening thus illuminates pure pharmacological connections marking convergent metabolic functions in distantly related organisms, implicating the FAAH-4/monoacylglyceride pathway as a regulator of lifespan in C. elegans. Phenotypic screening identifies a small-molecule inhibitor of the C. elegans serine hydrolase FAAH-4 that promotes longevity and identifies the enzyme as the functional homolog of mammalian monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL)."
https://openalex.org/W2922702572,"Biodiversity loss is driven by interacting factors operating at different spatial scales. Yet, there remains uncertainty as to how fine-scale environmental conditions mediate biological responses to broad-scale stressors. We surveyed intertidal rocky shore kelp beds situated across a local gradient of wave action and evaluated changes in kelp diversity and abundance after more than two decades of broad scale stressors, most notably the 2013-2016 heat wave. Across all sites, species were less abundant on average in 2017 and 2018 than during 1993-1995 but changes in kelp diversity were dependent on wave exposure, with wave exposed habitats remaining stable and wave sheltered habitats experiencing near complete losses of kelp diversity. In this way, wave exposed sites have acted as refugia, maintaining regional kelp diversity despite widespread local declines. Fucoids, seagrasses and two stress-tolerant kelp species (Saccharina sessilis, Egregia menziesii) did not decline as observed in other kelps, and the invasive species Sargassum muticum increased significantly at wave sheltered sites. Long-term monitoring data from a centrally-located moderate site suggest that kelp communities were negatively impacted by the recent heatwave which may have driven observed losses throughout the region. Wave-sheltered shores, which saw the largest declines, are a very common habitat type in the Northeast Pacific and may be especially sensitive to losses in kelp diversity and abundance, with potential consequences for coastal productivity. Our findings highlight the importance of fine-scale environmental heterogeneity in mediating biological responses and demonstrate how incorporating differences between habitat patches can be essential to capturing scale-dependent biodiversity loss across the landscape."
https://openalex.org/W2923035979,"Huntington’s disease (HD) is a monogenic neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expansion of the CAG trinucleotide repeat domain in the huntingtin (HTT) gene, leading to an expanded poly-glutamine (polyQ) stretch in the HTT protein. This mutant HTT (mHTT) protein is highly prone to intracellular aggregation, causing significant damage and cellular loss in the striatal, cortical, and other regions of the brain. Therefore, modulation of mHTT levels in these brain regions in order to reduce intracellular mHTT and aggregate levels represents a direct approach in the development of HD therapeutics. To this end, assays that can be used to detect changes in HTT levels in biological samples are invaluable tools to assess target engagement and guide dose selection in clinical trials. The Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) ELISA-based assay platform is a robust and sensitive method previously employed for the quantification of HTT. However, the currently available MSD assays for HTT are primarily detecting the monomeric soluble form of the protein, but not aggregated species. In this study, we describe the development of novel MSD assays preferentially detecting mHTT in an aggregated form. Recombinant monomeric HTT(1–97)-Q46, which forms aggregates in a time-dependent manner, was used to characterize the ability of each established assay to distinguish between HTT monomers and HTT in a higher assembly state. Further validation of these assays was performed using brain lysates from R6/2, zQ175 knock-in, and BACHD mouse models, to replicate a previously well-characterized age-dependent increase in brain aggregate signals, as well as a significant reduction of aggregate levels in the striatum following mHTT knockdown with a CAG-directed allele-specific zinc-finger repressor protein (ZFP). Lastly, size exclusion chromatography was used to separate and characterize HTT species from brain tissue lysates to demonstrate specificity of the assays for the fractions containing aggregated HTT. In summary, we demonstrate that the newly developed assays preferentially detect aggregated HTT with improved performance in comparison to previous assay technologies. These assays complement the existing MSD platform assays specific for soluble HTT monomers, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis of disease-relevant HTT species in preclinical models of HD."

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability of POS oral suspension in pediatric subjects with neutropenia. Methods This was a prospective, multicenter, sequential dose-escalation study. Enrolled subjects were divided into 3 age groups: AG1, 7 to <18 years; AG2, 2 to <7 years; and AG3, 3 months to <2 years. AG1 and AG2 were divided into 3 dosage cohorts: DC1, 12 mg/kg/day divided twice daily (BID); DC2, 18 mg/kg/day BID; and DC3, 18 mg/kg/day divided thrice daily (TID). AG3 was also divided into DC1 and DC2; however, no subjects were enrolled in DC2. Subjects received 7–28 days of POS oral suspension. PK samples were collected at predefined time points. The POS PK target was predefined as ~90% of subjects with Cavg (AUC /dosing interval) between 500 and 2500 ng/mL, with an anticipated mean steady state Cavg exposure of ~1200 ng/mL. Results The percentage of subjects meeting the PK target was <90% across all age groups and dosage cohorts (range: 31% to 80%). The percentage of subjects that achieved the Cavg target of 500 to 2500 ng/mL on Day 7 ranged from 31% to 80%, with the lowest proportion in subjects 2 to <7 years receiving 12 mg/kg/day BID (AG2/DC1) and the highest proportion in subjects 7 to <18 years receiving 18 mg/kg/day TID (AG1/DC3). At all three dose levels (12 mg/kg/day BID, 18 mg/kg/day BID and 18 mg/kg/day TID), subjects in AG1 (7 to <18 years old) had higher mean PK exposures at steady state than those in AG2. High variability in exposures was observed in all groups. POS oral suspension was generally well tolerated and most of the reported adverse events were related to the subjects’ underlying diseases. Conclusion The POS PK target of 90% of subjects with Cavg between 500 and 2500 ng/mL was not achieved in any of the age groups across the different dosage cohorts. New formulations of the molecule with a greater potential to achieve the established PK target are currently under investigation. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01716234"

In this study, we employed next generation amplicon sequencing to assess the effect of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) films on the structure of bacterial and fungal communities in four mature compost piles with age ranging between 2 and 10 years. While, bacterial Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and fungi Ascomycota were most abundant across all facilities, our data indicated significant differences in compost microbiomes between compost facilities, which might be related to compost chemical parameters, age of piles and characteristics of the feedstock. In addition, a substantial shift in the interaction pattern within microbial communities from bulk and plastic-associated (PA) compost was detected. For example, cooperation between Firmicutes Bacillaceae and Thermoactinomycetaceae was detected only in PA compost. However, based on the analysis of the diversity indices and the relative abundances of microbial taxa we can conclude that the presence of plastics in compost had no significant effect on the structure of microbial community."
https://openalex.org/W2925294180,"Immunotherapy has fundamentally changed the landscape of cancer treatment. Despite the encouraging results with the checkpoint modulators, response rates vary widely across tumor types, with a majority of patients exhibiting either primary resistance without a significant initial response to treatment or acquired resistance with subsequent disease progression. Hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1) is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cell linages and serves as a negative regulator in T cells and dendritic cells (DC). While HPK1 gene knockout (KO) studies suggest its role in anti-tumor immune responses, the involvement of kinase activity and thereof its therapeutic potential remain unknown. To investigate the potential of pharmacological intervention using inhibitors of HPK1, we generated HPK1 kinase dead (KD) mice which carry a single loss-of—function point mutation in the kinase domain and interrogated the role of kinase activity in immune cells in the context of suppressive factors or the tumor microenvironment (TME). Our data provide novel findings that HKP1 kinase activity is critical in conferring suppressive functions of HPK1 in a wide range of immune cells including CD4+, CD8+, DC, NK to Tregs, and inactivation of kinase domain was sufficient to elicit robust anti-tumor immune responses. These data support the concept that an HPK1 small molecule kinase inhibitor could serve as a novel agent to provide additional benefit in combination with existing immunotherapies, particularly to overcome resistance to current treatment regimens."
https://openalex.org/W2940624011,"Snakin-1 is a member of the Solanum tuberosum Snakin/GASA family. We previously demonstrated that Snakin-1 is involved in plant defense to pathogens as well as in plant growth and development, but its mechanism of action has not been completely elucidated yet. Here, we showed that leaves of Snakin-1 silenced potato transgenic plants exhibited increased levels of reactive oxygen species and significantly reduced content of ascorbic acid. Furthermore, Snakin-1 silencing enhanced salicylic acid content in accordance with an increased expression of SA-inducible PRs genes. Interestingly, gibberellic acid levels were also enhanced and transcriptome analysis revealed that a large number of genes related to sterol biosynthesis were downregulated in these silenced lines. Moreover, we demonstrated that Snakin-1 directly interacts with StDIM/DWF1, an enzyme involved in plant sterols biosynthesis. Additionally, the analysis of the expression pattern of PStSN1::GUS in potato showed that Snakin-1 is present mainly in young tissues associated with active growth and cell division zones. Our comprehensive analysis of Snakin-1 silenced lines demonstrated for the first time in potato that Snakin-1 plays a role in redox balance and participates in a complex crosstalk among different hormones."
https://openalex.org/W2923357444,"The kingdoms of life share many small molecule cofactors and coenzymes. Molybdenum cofactor (Moco) is synthesized by many archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes, and is essential for human development. The genome of Caenorhabditis elegans contains all of the Moco biosynthesis genes, and surprisingly these genes are not essential if the animals are fed a bacterial diet that synthesizes Moco. C. elegans lacking both endogenous Moco synthesis and dietary Moco from bacteria arrest development, demonstrating interkingdom Moco transfer. Our screen of Escherichia coli mutants identifies genes necessary for synthesis of bacterial Moco or transfer to C. elegans. Developmental arrest of Moco-deficient C. elegans is caused by loss of sulfite oxidase, a Moco-requiring enzyme, and is suppressed by mutations in either C. elegans cystathionine gamma-lyase or cysteine dioxygenase, blocking toxic sulfite production from cystathionine. Thus, we define the genetic pathways for an interkingdom dialogue focused on sulfur homeostasis. The molybdenum cofactor (Moco) is required for survival to mitigate sulfite toxicity. Genetic studies in C. elegans reveal that Moco-biosynthetic mutants are able to survive if Moco is provided through the microbial diet."
https://openalex.org/W2923387117,"Sperm morphology and morphometry are important parameters in predicting fertility. Sperm are considered to be normal if the shape and size of the head, midpiece and tail fall within the classification for a given species. It is important to select the appropriate technique for staining the semen of a given species, because, as many authors have pointed out, some methods work well for one species but are not suitable for analysing another. The aim of the study was to assess the morphometric parameters of boar sperm following the use of different staining techniques and to verify the hypothesis that the staining technique affects the morphometric parameters of sperm. The staining method was found to significantly affect the dimensions of the boar sperm head. The semen stained by the SpermBlue technique had the closest morphometric sperm head parameters to those of the unstained sperm, so this technique, rather than the routinely used eosin and gentian complex, should be the leading technique in the evaluation of boar sperm morphometry. Silver nitrate staining reveals the structure of the sperm in the most detail; this method can be considered universal, and can be used independently or to supplement routine diagnostics. As the staining technique should interfere as little as possible with the structure of the sperm, while revealing its morphology in as much detail as possible, it is crucial to establish the natural dimensions of the unstained sperm head before determining the optimal technique and its reference values. The recommended or most commonly-used techniques are not always the best options for the staining and analysis of sperm of a given species."
https://openalex.org/W2943688984,"In the last 15 years, Theory of Mind research has been revolutionized by the development of new implicit tasks. Such tasks aim at tapping children's and adults' uninstructed, largely automatic mental state ascription, indicated in spontaneous looking behavior when observing agents who act on the basis of false beliefs. Studies with anticipatory looking, in particular, have suggested that basic ToM capacities operate from very early in life and remain in unconscious operation throughout the lifespan. Recently, however, systematic replication attempts of anticipatory looking measures have yielded a complex and puzzling mixture of successful, partial and non-replications. The present study aimed at shedding light on the question whether there is a system to this pattern. More specifically, in a set of three preregistered experiments, it was tested whether those conditions that could previously be replicated and those that could not differ in crucial conceptual respects such that the former do not strictly require ToM whereas the latter do. This was tested by the implementation of novel control conditions. The results were complex. There was generally no unambiguous evidence for reliable spontaneous ToM and no effect of the number of passed familiarization trials. Neither was there any unambiguous evidence that the previous mixed patterns of (non-)replications could be explained (away) by the sub-mentalizing account tested in the new control conditions. The empirical situation remains puzzling, and the question whether there is some such thing as implicit and spontaneous ToM remains to be clarified."
https://openalex.org/W2924113940,"Literature on consumer choice has demonstrated that the inclusion of an inferior alternative choice (decoy) can increase interest in a target product or action. In two online studies, we tested the impact of decoys on the probability of previous non-intenders to have a screening test which could significantly lower their chances of dying of colorectal cancer. We find that the presence of a decoy increased the probability to choose screening at the target hospital (over no screening) from 39% to 54% and 37% to 59% depending on how many hospital attributes were communicated and how strongly the decoy was dominated by the target. We also show that the presence of the decoy was associated with lower levels of reported decisional complexity while not undermining information seeking and knowledge acquisition. These findings offer a ‘proof of principle’ that decoys have the potential to increase screening uptake without negatively influencing informed choice."
https://openalex.org/W2924654086,"Platelets can promote several stages of the metastatic process and thus contribute to malignant progression. As an example, platelets promote invasive properties of tumor cells by induction of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). In this study, we show that tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family member-associated NF-κB activator (TANK)-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) is a previously unknown mediator of platelet-induced EMT in mammary carcinoma cells. Coculture of 2 mammary carcinoma cell lines, Ep5 from mice and MCF10A(MII) from humans, with isolated platelets induced morphologic as well as molecular changes characteristic of EMT, which was paralleled with activation of TBK1. TBK1 depletion using small interfering RNA impaired platelet-induced EMT in both Ep5 and MCF10A(MII) cells. Furthermore, platelet-induced activation of the NF-κB subunit p65 was suppressed after TBK1 knockdown, demonstrating that TBK1 mediates platelet-induced NF-κB signaling and EMT. Using an in vivo metastasis assay, we found that depletion of TBK1 from mammary carcinoma cells during in vitro preconditioning with platelets subsequently suppressed the formation of lung metastases in mice. Altogether, these results suggest that TBK1 contributes to tumor invasiveness and may be a driver of metastatic spread in breast cancer.—Zhang, Y., Unnithan, R. V.

https://openalex.org/W2924287205,"Introduction Global efforts to end HIV by 2030 focus on reducing and eventually eliminating new infections in priority populations. Identifying these populations and characterizing their vulnerability factors helps in guiding investment of scarce HIV prevention resources to achieve maximum impact. We sought to establish HIV prevalence, spatial distribution and risk factors for HIV infection in the Kenyan fishing communities of Lake Victoria. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 2637 people from all the 308 fish-landing beaches on the Kenyan shore of Lake Victoria. The number of participants enrolled at each beach were weighted based on the size of the beach, determined by the number of functional registered boats. We used simple random sampling to select those to be approached for study participation. Consenting participants were privately interviewed about their socio-economic and demographic characteristics and sexual behavior, and were invited for HIV test using the Kenya rapid HIV testing protocol. We used descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic and linear regression for analysis. Results We found high HIV prevalence of 32% with significant differences between men (29%) and women (38%). Among men, having an HIV negative sexual partner, being circumcised, increasing number of condom protected sex acts in the preceding month, being younger and being a resident of Homa Bay, Kisumu, Siaya and Busia counties compared to Migori County reduced the risk of HIV infection. For women, being married, having more children with the current spouse, having an HIV negative sexual partner and being a resident of Busia compared to Migori County reduced the risk of HIV infection. We also found that longer distance from the beaches to the nearest public health facilities was associated with increasing cumulative HIV prevalence at the beaches. Conclusion Fishing communities have high HIV prevalence and may greatly benefit from interventions such as wider ART coverage, couple HIV risk reduction counseling, PrEP use for HIV negative partner at substantial continuous risk, alongside other HIV prevention services that the Kenyan government is currently rolling out. This will additionally require adequate plans to synchronize the provision of these services with the population’s routine schedules for all these options to be reasonably accessible to them."
https://openalex.org/W2944670712,"Macrophage fusion leading to the formation of multinucleated giant cells is a hallmark of chronic inflammation. Several membrane proteins have been implicated in mediating cell–cell attachment during fusion, but their binding partners remain unknown. Recently, we demonstrated that interleukin-4 (IL-4)-induced fusion of mouse macrophages depends on the integrin macrophage antigen 1 (Mac-1). Surprisingly, the genetic deficiency of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), an established ligand of Mac-1, did not impair macrophage fusion, suggesting the involvement of other counter-receptors. Here, using various approaches, including signal regulatory protein α (SIRPα) knockdown, recombinant proteins, adhesion and fusion assays, biolayer interferometry, and peptide libraries, we show that SIRPα, which, similar to ICAM-1, belongs to the Ig superfamily and has previously been implicated in cell fusion, interacts with Mac-1. The following results support the conclusion that SIRPα is a ligand of Mac-1: (a) recombinant ectodomain of SIRPα supports adhesion of Mac-1–expressing cells; (b) Mac-1–SIRPα interaction is mediated through the ligand-binding αMI-domain of Mac-1; (c) recognition of SIRPα by the αMI-domain conforms to general principles governing binding of Mac-1 to many of its ligands; (d) SIRPα reportedly binds CD47; however, anti-CD47 function-blocking mAb produced only a limited inhibition of macrophage adhesion to SIRPα; and (e) co-culturing of SIRPα- and Mac-1–expressing HEK293 cells resulted in the formation of multinucleated cells. Taken together, these results identify SIRPα as a counter-receptor for Mac-1 and suggest that the Mac-1–SIRPα interaction may be involved in macrophage fusion."
https://openalex.org/W2924491418,"Future climate change will impose increased variability on food production and food trading networks. However, the effect of climate variability and sudden shocks on resource availability through trade and its subsequent effect on population growth is largely unknown. Here we study the effect of resource variability and network topology on access to resources and population growth, using a model of population growth limited by resource availability in a trading network. Resources are redistributed in the network based on supply and the distance between nodes (i.e. cities or countries). Resources at nodes vary over time with wave parameters that mimic changes in biomass production arising from known climate variability. Random perturbations to resources are applied to study resilience of individual nodes and the system as a whole. The model demonstrates that redistribution of resources increases the maximum population that can be supported (carrying capacity) by the network. Fluctuations in carrying capacity depend on the amplitude and frequency of resource variability: fluctuations become larger for increasing amplitude and decreasing frequency. Our study shows that topology is the key factor determining the carrying capacity of a node. In larger networks the carrying capacity increases and the distribution of resources in the network becomes more equal. The most central nodes achieve a higher carrying capacity than nodes with a lower centrality. Moreover, central nodes are less susceptible to long-term resource variability and shocks. These insights can be used to understand how worldwide equitable access to resources can be maintained under increasing climate variability."
https://openalex.org/W2924635036,"Autophagy, a lysosomal degradative pathway in response to nutrient limitation, plays an important regulatory role in lipid homeostasis upon energy demands. Here, we demonstrated that the endoplasmic reticulum–tethered, stress-sensing transcription factor cAMP-responsive element-binding protein, hepatic-specific (CREBH) functions as a major transcriptional regulator of hepatic autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis in response to nutritional or circadian signals. CREBH deficiency led to decreased hepatic autophagic activities and increased hepatic lipid accumulation upon starvation. Under unfed or during energy-demanding phases of the circadian cycle, CREBH is activated to drive expression of the genes encoding the key enzymes or regulators in autophagosome formation or autophagic process, including microtubule-associated protein IB-light chain 3, autophagy-related protein (ATG)7, ATG2b, and autophagosome formation Unc-51 like kinase 1, and the genes encoding functions in lysosomal biogenesis and homeostasis. Upon nutrient starvation, CREBH regulates and interacts with peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor α (PPARα) and PPARγ coactivator 1α to synergistically drive expression of the key autophagy genes and transcription factor EB, a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis. Furthermore, CREBH regulates rhythmic expression of the key autophagy genes in the liver in a circadian-dependent manner. In summary, we identified CREBH as a key transcriptional regulator of hepatic autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis for the purpose of maintaining hepatic lipid homeostasis under nutritional stress or circadian oscillation.—Kim, H., Williams, D., Qiu, Y., Song, Z., Yang, Z., Kimler, V., Goldberg, A., Zhang, R., Yang, Z., Chen, X., Wang, L., Fang, D., Lin, J.

https://openalex.org/W2922788213,"This study assessed morphological variation of the depth-generalist coral Montastraea cavernosa across shallow and mesophotic coral ecosystems in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) using thirteen corallite metrics. While corallite structure differed significantly across sites, we observed that mean corallite diameters were smaller and spacing was greater in mesophotic corals as compared to shallow corals. Additional corallite variation, including greater mean corallite height of mesophotic samples, are hypothesized to be photoadaptive responses to low light environments. Multivariate analyses also revealed two distinct morphotypes identified by significant variation in corallite spacing with >90% accuracy. A ‘shallow’ morphotype was characterized by larger, more closely-spaced corallites, while a ‘depth-generalist’ type exhibited smaller, further-spaced corallites. Variable presence of morphotypes within some sites suggests genotypic influence on corallite morphology as there was a slight, but significant, impact of morphotype on genetic structure within shallow zones in the Flower Garden Banks. Patterns of increased algal symbiont (Symbiodiniaceae) density and chlorophyll concentration were retained in the depth-generalist morphotype even in shallow zones, identifying multiple photoadaptive strategies between morphotypes. The results of this study suggest that morphological variation among M. cavernosa represents a combination of genotypic variation and phenotypic plasticity rather than responses to environmental stimuli alone."

In the current study, we investigated the role of microRNA (miR) in the regulation of adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) phenotype following treatment of DIO mice with the CB1 antagonist SR141716A. DIO mice were fed high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks and then treated daily with SR141716A (10 mg/kg) for 4 weeks while continuing HFD. Treated mice experienced weight loss, persistent reduction in fat mass, improvements in metabolic profile, and decreased adipose inflammation. CB1 blockade resulted in down-regulation of several miRs in ATMs, including the miR-466 family and miR-762. Reduced expression of the miR-466 family led to induction of anti-inflammatory M2 transcription factors KLF4 and STAT6, whereas down-regulation of miR-762 promoted induction of AGAP-2, a negative regulator of the neuroimmune retention cues, Netrin-1 and its coreceptor UNC5B. Furthermore, treatment of primary macrophages with SR141716A up-regulated KLF4 and STAT6, reduced secretion of Netrin-1, and increased migration toward the lymph node chemoattractant CCL19.

The aim of the present study is to describe some innate behaviours of laboratory bred three-spined sticklebacks by using a battery of tests that have been developed and validated to model some aspects of human psychiatric disorders in zebrafish. We recorded mirror induced aggression, novel object boldness, shoaling, and anxiety-like behaviour using both the novel tank diving and the black-white preference tests. We show that behaviour of three-spined sticklebacks in these standard tests is remarkably similar to that of zebrafish and other species and can be altered by fluoxetine and buspirone.

The influence of APOE common polymorphisms on plasma lipid/lipoprotein profile, especially on LDL-related traits, is well recognized; however, little is known about the role of other genes/variants in this gene cluster. In this study, we evaluated the role of common and uncommon/rare genetic variation in this gene region on inter-individual variation in plasma lipoprotein levels in non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs) and African blacks (ABs). In the variant discovery step, the APOE, APOC1, APOC4, APOC2 genes were sequenced along with their flanking and hepatic control regions (HCR1 and HCR2) in 190 subjects with extreme HDL-C/TG levels. The next step involved the genotyping of 623 NHWs and 788 ABs for the identified uncommon/rare variants and common tagSNPs along with additional relevant SNPs selected from public resources, followed by association analyses with lipid traits. A total of 230 sequence variants, including 15 indels were identified, of which 65 were novel. A total of 70 QC-passed variants in NHWs and 108 QC-passed variants in ABs were included in the final association analyses. Single-site association analysis of SNPs with MAF>1% revealed 20 variants in NHWs and 24 variants in ABs showing evidence of association with at least one lipid trait, including several variants exhibiting independent associations from the established APOE polymorphism even after multiple-testing correction. Overall, our study has confirmed known associations and also identified novel associations in this genomic region with various lipid traits.

Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis (HAEC) is a significant and life-threatening complication of HSCR, affecting up to 60% of patients. Animal models of endothelin receptor B (EdnrB) mutation reliably model human HSCR and HAEC. We previously demonstrated intestinal dysbiosis and a gut-specific deficiency of B-lymphocyte-produced secretory IgA (sIgA), the primary effector molecule of mucosal immunity, in mice with homozygous neural crest cell-conditional deletion of EdnrB (EdnrBNCC-/-). To determine mechanisms for sIgA deficiency, we examined intrinsic and extrinsic aspects of B-lymphocyte development and function. Expression of the endothelin axis components [endothelin-1 (ET-1), endothelin-3 (ET-3), endothelin receptor A (EdnrA), EdnrB] were determined over a developmental time course. B-lymphocyte survival and Ig production were assayed in vitro. Polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR)-mediated IgA transport into the intestinal lumen was interrogated. We found endothelin axis component (EdnrA, EdnrB, ET-1, ET-3) expression in developing extramedullary hematopoietic organs and that some splenic B lymphocytes express EdnrB. Splenic B lymphocytes from EdnrBNCC-/- mice showed no intrinsic defect in survival vs. wild-type (WT) B lymphocytes. In vitro stimulation of splenic B lymphocytes demonstrated decreased IgA, IgG, and IgM production in EdnrBNCC-/-vs. WT mice. Additionally, small intestinal pIgR was decreased ∼50% in EdnrBNCC-/- mice. These results suggest an intrinsic B-lymphocyte defect in antibody production as well as an extrinsic defect in IgA transport in the EdnrBNCC-/- model of HAEC. Our results are consistent with human HAEC observations of decreased luminal sIgA and mouse models of other inflammatory bowel diseases, in which decreased pIgR is seen in concert with a dysregulated microbiota. Finally, our results suggest targeting the dysbiotic microbiome and pIgR-mediated sIgA transport as potential therapeutic approaches in prevention and treatment of HAEC.-Medrano, G., Cailleux, F., Guan, P., Kuruvilla, K., Barlow-Anacker, A.

While previous studies have surveyed the role of miRNA regulation on different myeloid cell lines and primary cultures, the time-dependent kinetics of inflammatory stimulation on miRNA expression and the relationship between miRNA-to-target RNA expression have not been comprehensively profiled in monocytes. In this study, we use next-generation sequencing and RT-PCR assays to analyze the non-coding small RNA transcriptome of unstimulated and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated monocytes at 6 and 24 hours. We identified a miRNA signature consisting of five mature miRNAs (hsa-mir-146a, hsa-mir-155, hsa-mir-9, hsa-mir-147b, and hsa-mir-193a) upregulated by LPS-stimulated monocytes after 6 hours and found that most miRNAs were also upregulated after 24 hours of stimulation. Only one miRNA gene was down-regulated and no other small RNAs were found dysregulated in monocytes after LPS treatment. In addition, novel tRNA-derived fragments were also discovered in monocytes although none showed significant changes upon LPS stimulation. Interrogation of validated miRNA targets by transcriptomic analysis revealed that absolute expression of most miRNA targets implicating in innate immune response decreased over time in LPS-stimulated monocytes although their expression patterns along the treatment were heterogeneous. Our findings reveal a potential role by which selective miRNA upregulation and stable expression of other small RNAs enable monocytes to develop finely tuned cellular responses during acute inflammation."

One of the best-recognized examples of such interplay is the metabolic cooperation and crosstalk between mitochondria and peroxisomes, both organelles being functionally and physically connected and linked to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

Recently, peroxisome-mitochondria contact sites (PerMit) have been reported and among Permit tethers, one component of the ERMES complex (Mdm34) was shown to interact with the peroxin Pex11, suggesting that the ERMES complex or part of it may be involved in two membrane contact sites (ER-mitochondria and peroxisome- mitochondria). This opens the possibility of exchanges between these three membrane compartments. Here, we investigated in details the role of each ERMES subunit on peroxisome abundance. First, we confirmed previous studies from other groups showing that absence of Mdm10 or Mdm12 leads to an increased number of mature peroxisomes. Secondly, we showed that this is not simply due to respiratory function defect, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) loss or mitochondrial network alteration.

Outcomes evaluated within 12 months included AVF intervention rates, CVC exposure, late dialysis suitability failure, and times to primary patency loss, abandonment and successful cannulation.Final analyses included 536 participants randomised to fish oil or placebo (mean age 55 years, 64% male, 45% diabetic) and 388 randomised to aspirin or placebo. Compared with placebo, fish oil reduced intervention rates (0.82 vs 1.14/1000 patient-days, incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.54-0.97), particularly interventions for acute thrombosis (0.09 vs 0.17/1000 patient-days, IRR 0.53, 95% CI 0.34-0.84). Aspirin significantly reduced rescue intervention rates (IRR 0.45, 95% CI 0.27-0.78). Neither agent significantly affected CVC exposure, late dialysis suitability failure or time to primary patency loss, AVF abandonment or successful cannulation.Although fish oil and low-dose aspirin given for 3 months reduced intervention rates in newly created AVF, they had no significant effects on CVC exposure, AVF usability and time to primary patency loss or access abandonment. Reduction in access interventions benefits patients, reduces costs and warrants further study."

Genetic strategies using Cre-dependent mouse strains, especially the Ai32 line expressing Channelrhodopsin (ChR2)-EYFP fusion protein, have been a popular means to drive opsin expression in a cell-type specific manner. Here we report a low level of leaky ‘off-target’ (Cre-independent) ChR2-EYFP expression in Ai32/Ai32 homozygous mice throughout the nervous system. This leaky off-target expression was characterized in multiple prevalent nervous system regions using anti-EYFP immunostaining. Expression of full-length ChR2-EYFP protein was confirmed using immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting. Notably, light stimulation of these ChR2-EYFP expressing neurons in the spinal cord dorsal horn did not induce detectable photocurrents in juvenile 4-week old mice. Given the wide use of the Ai32 line by many labs, our results suggest researchers should be vigilant of possible off-target ChR2-EYFP expression in their region of interest, especially when generating Ai32/Ai32 homozygotes to drive high levels of ChR2-EYFP expression in adult mice."
https://openalex.org/W2922792455,"Fe(III)-rich deposits referred to as ""iron mounds"" develop when Fe(II)-rich acid mine drainage (AMD) emerges at the terrestrial surface, and aeration of the fluids induces oxidation of Fe(II), with subsequent precipitation of Fe(III) phases. As Fe(III) phases accumulate in these systems, O2 gradients may develop in the sediments and influence the distributions and extents of aerobic and anaerobic microbiological Fe metabolism, and in turn the solubility of Fe. To determine how intrusion of O2 into iron mound sediments influences microbial community composition and Fe metabolism, we incubated samples of these sediments in a column format. O2 was only supplied through the top of the columns, and microbiological, geochemical, and electrochemical changes at discrete depths were determined with time. Despite the development of dramatic gradients in dissolved Fe(II) concentrations, indicating Fe(II) oxidation in shallower portions and Fe(III) reduction in the deeper portions, microbial communities varied little with depth, suggesting the metabolic versatility of organisms in the sediments with respect to Fe metabolism. Additionally, the availability of O2 in shallow portions of the sediments influenced Fe metabolism in deeper, O2-free sediments. Total potential (EH + self-potential) measurements at discrete depths in the columns indicated that Fe transformations and electron transfer processes were occurring through the sediments and could explain the impact of O2 on Fe metabolism past where it penetrates into the sediments. This work shows that O2 availability (or lack of it) minimally influences microbial communities, but influences microbial activities beyond its penetration depth in AMD-derived Fe(III) rich sediments. Our results indicate that O2 can modulate Fe redox state and solubility in larger volumes of iron mound sediments than only those directly exposed to O2."
https://openalex.org/W2923834556,"This study is a proof of concept that the sponge derived pyrrole-imidazole alkaloid Ageladine A acts as an additional light harvesting molecule for photosynthesis of symbionts of marine sponges. The absorbance of Ageladine A is in the UV range and fluoresces blue, matching the blue absorbance of chlorophyll a. A joint modeling and experimental approach demonstrates that Ageladine A increases photosynthetic O2 production of Synechococcus bacillaris WH5701 (CCMP1333), when the cells are exposed to UV light, which is marginally used for photosynthesis. Due to the presence of Ageladine A, production of O2 increased 2.54 and 3.1-fold, in the experiments and the model, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2923523960,"Background Thousands of physicians attend scientific conferences each year. While recent data indicate that variation in staffing during such meetings impacts survival of non-surgical patients, the association between treatment during conferences and outcomes of a surgical population remain unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine mortality resulting from traumatic injuries and the influence of hospital admission during national surgery meetings. Study design Retrospective analysis of in-hospital mortality using data from the Trauma Quality Improvement Program (2010–2011). Identified patients admitted during four annual meetings and compared their mortality with that of patients admitted during non-conference periods. Analysis included 155 hospitals with 12,256 patients admitted on 42 conference days and 82,399 patients admitted on 270 non-conference days. Multivariate analysis performed separately for hospitals with different levels of trauma center verification by state and American College of Surgeons (ACS) criteria. Results Patient characteristics were similar between meeting and non-meeting dates. At ACS level I and level II trauma centers during conference versus non-conference dates, adjusted mortality was not significantly different. However, adjusted mortality increased significantly for patients admitted to trauma centers that lacked ACS trauma verification during conferences versus non-conference days (OR 1.2, p = 0.008), particularly for patients with penetrating injuries, whose mortality rose from 11.6% to 15.9% (p = 0.006). Conclusions Trauma mortality increased during surgery conferences compared to non-conference dates for patients admitted to hospitals that lacked ACS trauma level verification. The mortality difference at those hospitals was greatest for patients who presented with penetrating injuries."
https://openalex.org/W2942410044,"Autoantigen-specific methods to prevent and treat Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) carry high hopes to permanently cure this disease, but have largely failed in clinical trials. One suggested approach to increase the efficacy of islet antigen-specific vaccination is to combine it with a modulator of the T cell response, with the goal of reducing effector differentiation and promoting regulatory T cells (Tregs). Here we asked if addition of antibodies that block the IL-7/IL-7Rα pathway altered the T cell response to islet antigen vaccination and prevented T1D in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. Anti-IL-7Rα monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) reduced the numbers of islet antigen-specific T cells generated after vaccination with islet peptides and alum. However, addition of anti-IL-7Rα antibodies to peptide/alum vaccination unexpectedly increased non-specific IFN-γ, IL-2 and IL-10 cytokine production and did not result in improved prevention of T1D onset. In a second approach, we used a conjugate vaccine to deliver islet autoantigens, using Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH) as a carrier. Islet antigen-KLH vaccination led to a significant expansion of antigen-specific Tregs and delayed diabetes onset in NOD mice. These outcomes were not further improved by addition of anti-IL-7Rα antibodies. To the contrary, blocking IL-7Rα during vaccination led to non-specific cytokine production and reduced the efficacy of a KLH-conjugated vaccine to prevent T1D. Our study thus revealed that adding anti-IL-7Rα antibodies during autoantigen immunization did not improve the efficacy of such vaccinations to prevent T1D, despite altering some aspects of the T cell response in a potentially advantageous way. Further refinement of this approach will be required to separate the beneficial from the adverse effects of anti-IL-7Rα antibodies to treat autoimmune disease."
https://openalex.org/W2923299948,"That water may not be an inert medium was indicated by the presence at water's interfaces a negatively charged solute free zone of several hundred microns in thickness called the exclusion zone (EZ). Further evidence was demonstrated by Ovchinnikova's experiments (2009) showing that water can store and release substantial amount of charge. We demonstrate that the charge storage capacity of water arises from highly stable large-scale ionic structures with measurable charge imbalances and discrete levels of charge density. We also show evidence that the charge zones formation requires ionic solutes, and their formation correlate to large change in conductivity, by as much as 250%. Our experiments indicate that large-scale structuring plays a pivotal role in electrolysis and conductivity in ionic solution. We propose that water is an electrochemically active medium and present a new model of electrolysis and conductivity in ionic solution."
