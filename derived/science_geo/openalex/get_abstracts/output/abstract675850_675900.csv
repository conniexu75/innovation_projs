https://openalex.org/W3037618930,"Accurate prediction of crop yield supported by scientific and domain-relevant insights, is useful to improve agricultural breeding, provide monitoring across diverse climatic conditions and thereby protect against climatic challenges to crop production. We used performance records from Uniform Soybean Tests (UST) in North America to build a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)-Recurrent Neural Network based model that leveraged pedigree relatedness measures along with weekly weather parameters to dissect and predict genotype response in multiple-environments. Our proposed models outperformed other competing machine learning models such as Support Vector Regression with Radial Basis Function kernel (SVR-RBF), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and the data-driven USDA model for yield prediction. Additionally, for providing interpretability of the important time-windows in the growing season, we developed a temporal attention mechanism for LSTM models. The outputs of such interpretable models could provide valuable insights to plant breeders."
https://openalex.org/W3167631805,"Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are being developed and installed in increasing numbers. Some of the most popular ADAS include blind spot monitoring and cruise control which are fitted in the majority of new vehicles sold in high-income countries. With more drivers having access to these technologies, it is imperative to develop policy and strategies to guarantee the safe uptake of ADAS. One key issue is that ADAS education has been primarily centred on the user manual which are not widely utilised. Moreover, it is unclear if user manuals are an adequate source of education in terms of content and readability. To address this research gap, a content analysis was used to assess the differences in ADAS-related content and readability among the manuals of the highest selling vehicles in Australia. The qualitative findings showed that there are seven themes in the user manuals: differences between driving with and without ADAS, familiarisation requirements, operational limits of the ADAS, potential ADAS errors, behaviour adaptation warnings, confusion warnings, and malfunction warnings. The quantitative analysis found that some of the manuals require several years of education above the recommended for a universal audience (>8 years) to be understood. Additionally, there is a notable number of text diversions and infographics which could make comprehension of the user manual difficult. This investigation shows that there is a lack of standardisation of ADAS user manuals (in both content and delivery of information) which requires regulatory oversight. Driver ADAS education needs to be prioritised by policymakers and practitioners as smart technology continues to increase across the transport system. It seems that current strategies based on user manuals are insufficient to achieve successful adoption and safe use of these technologies."
https://openalex.org/W3173094113,"An increase in global average surface temperature over the 21st century will affect food production. There is still uncertainty if the source of the production losses caused by climate change could be driven either by lower yield or reduced area harvested. We use county-level production data on winter wheat coupled with fine-scale weather outcomes between 1981-2007 to examine the impact of climate change on winter wheat production in Kansas. We decompose the total impact of weather variables through both the yield and harvested acreage channels. We find that an insignificant portion-both in terms of magnitude and statistical significance-of the production losses are due to reduced harvested acres (i.e., crop abandonment). The proportion harvested only account for 14.88% and 21.71% of the total damages under RCPs 4.5 and 8.5 and neither effect is statistically significant. An implication of this result implies that studies that only examine climate impacts on harvested yields are not significantly underestimating the climate change impacts on production."
https://openalex.org/W3172724059,"Malnutrition is a major health issue among Bangladeshi under-five (U5) children. Children are malnourished if the calories and proteins they take through their diet are not sufficient for their growth and maintenance. The goal of the research was to use machine learning (ML) algorithms to detect the risk factors of malnutrition (stunted, wasted, and underweight) as well as their prediction.This work utilized malnutrition data that was derived from Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey which was conducted in 2014. The selected dataset consisted of 7079 children with 13 factors. The potential risks of malnutrition have been identified by logistic regression (LR). Moreover, 3 ML classifiers (support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and LR) have been implemented for predicting malnutrition and the performance of these ML algorithms were assessed on the basis of accuracy.The average prevalence of stunted, wasted, and underweight was 35.4%, 15.4%, and 32.8%, respectively. It was noted that LR identified five risk factors for stunting and underweight, as well as four factors for wasting. Results illustrated that RF can be accurately classified as stunted, wasted, and underweight children and obtained the highest accuracy of 88.3% for stunted, 87.7% for wasted, and 85.7% for underweight.This research focused on the identification and prediction of major risk factors for stunting, wasting, and underweight using ML algorithms which will aid policymakers in reducing malnutrition among Bangladesh's U5 children."
https://openalex.org/W3168724907,"The aim of this study is to examine the effect that visitor satisfaction with traditional restaurants has on perceptions of the local gastronomy, the overall image of a city and loyalty to that destination. Fieldwork has been carried out in Córdoba, a city in southern Spain famous for being a UNESCO World Heritage city and for its traditional gastronomy. The methodology used is based on structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). This paper makes a novel contribution in that no previous studies to date have explored satisfaction with traditional restaurants, with respect to the food, the service and the atmosphere. To achieve the proposed objective, a structured questionnaire has been used to find out the opinions of diners in renowned restaurants that base their cuisine on traditional dishes made with quality local ingredients. The results obtained confirm that a satisfactory experience with the food of a traditional restaurant has a positive effect on the image of the destination and the gastronomy of the place, as well as on visitors' intentions to recommend and repeat the visit to said destination. Based on the analysis carried out, effective strategies are suggested to help manage these types of restaurants. The study provides theoretical and practical implications from a gastronomic perspective, which can enable tourism managers to employ new strategies to retain tourists visiting a city, based on increasing their post-experience satisfaction with restaurants featuring local cuisine."
https://openalex.org/W3166788254,"Background and objective During the COVID-19 pandemic the organization of maternity care changed drastically; this study into the experiences of maternity care professionals with these changes provides suggestions for the organization of care during and after pandemics. Design An online survey among Dutch midwives, obstetricians and obstetric residents. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were used to investigate associations between the respondents’ characteristics and answers. Results Reported advantages of the changes were fewer prenatal and postpartum consultations (50.1%). The necessity and safety of medical interventions and ultrasounds were considered more critically (75.9%); 14.8% of community midwives stated they referred fewer women to the hospital for decreased fetal movements, whereas 64.2% of the respondents working in hospital-based care experienced fewer consultations for this indication. Respondents felt that women had more confidence in giving birth at home (57.5%). Homebirths seemed to have increased according to 38.5% of the community midwives and 65.3% of the respondents working in hospital-based care. Respondents appreciated the shift to more digital consultations rather than face-to-face consultations. Mentioned disadvantages were that women had appointments alone, (71.1%) and that the community midwife was not allowed to join a woman to obstetric-led care during labour and subsequently stay with her (56.8%). Fewer postpartum visits by family and friends led to more tranquility (59.8%). Overall, however, 48.0% of the respondents felt that the safety of maternity care was compromised due to policy changes. Conclusions Maternity care professionals were positive about the decrease in routine care and the increased confidence of women in home birth, but also felt that safety in maternity care was sometimes compromised. According to the respondents in a future crisis situation it should be possible for community midwives to continue to deliver a personal handover after the referral of women to the hospital, and to stay with them."
https://openalex.org/W3172146816,"Introduction There is an evidence gap regarding the duration of SARS-CoV-2 shedding and of its variability across different care settings and by age, sex, income, and co-morbidities. Such evidence is part of understanding of infectivity and reinfection. We examine direct measures of viral shedding using a linked population-based health administrative dataset. Methods Laboratory and sociodemographic databases for Ontario, Canada were linked to identify those testing positive (RT-PCR) between Jan. 15 and April 30, 2020 who underwent subsequent testing by May 31, 2020. To maximise use of available data, we computed two shedding duration estimates defined as the time between initial positive and most recent positive (documented shedding) or second of two negative tests (documented resolution). We also report multivariable results using quantile regression to examine subgroup differences. Results In Ontario, of the 16,595 who tested positive before April 30, 2020, 6604 had sufficient subsequent testing to allow shedding duration calculation. Documented shedding median duration calculated in 4,889 (29% of 16,595) patients was 19 days (IQR 12–28). Documented resolution median duration calculated in 3,219 (19% of the 16,595) patients was 25 days (IQR 18–34). Long-term care residents had 3–5 day longer shedding durations using both definitions. Shorter documented shedding durations of 2–4 days were observed in those living in higher income neighbourhoods. Shorter documented resolution durations of 2–3 days were observed at the 25 th % of the distribution in those aged 20–49. Only 11.5% of those with definitive negative test results reverted to negative status by day 14. Conclusions Viral shedding continued well beyond 14 days among this large subset of a population-based group with COVID-19, and longer still for long-term care residents and those living in less affluent neighborhoods. Our findings do not speak to duration of infectivity but are useful for understanding the expected duration of RT-PCR positivity and for identifying reinfection."
https://openalex.org/W3170152309,"Question and answer (Q&A) websites are a medium where people can communicate and help each other. Stack Overflow is one of the most popular Q&A websites about programming, where millions of developers seek help or provide valuable assistance. Activity on the Stack Overflow website is moderated by the user community, utilizing a voting system to promote high quality content. The website was created on 2008 and has accumulated a large amount of crowd wisdom about the software development industry. Here we analyse this data to examine trends in the grouping of technologies and their users into different sub-communities. In our work we analysed all questions, answers, votes and tags from Stack Overflow between 2008 and 2020. We generated a series of user-technology interaction graphs and applied community detection algorithms to identify the biggest user communities for each year, to examine which technologies those communities incorporate, how they are interconnected and how they evolve through time. The biggest and most persistent communities were related to web development. In general, there is little movement between communities; users tend to either stay within the same community or not acquire any score at all. Community evolution reveals the popularity of different programming languages and frameworks on Stack Overflow over time. These findings give insight into the user community on Stack Overflow and reveal long-term trends on the software development industry."
https://openalex.org/W3166690914,"Two new chimeric Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) proteins, Cry1A.2 and Cry1B.2, were constructed using specific domains, which provide insecticidal activity against key lepidopteran soybean pests while minimizing receptor overlaps between themselves, current, and soon to be commercialized plant incorporated protectants (PIP's) in soybean. Results from insect diet bioassays demonstrate that the recombinant Cry1A.2 and Cry1B.2 are toxic to soybean looper (SBL) Chrysodeixis includens Walker, velvetbean caterpillar (VBC) Anticarsia gemmatalis Hubner, southern armyworm (SAW) Spodoptera eridania, and black armyworm (BLAW) Spodoptera cosmioides with LC50 values < 3,448 ng/cm2. Cry1B.2 is of moderate activity with significant mortality and stunting at > 3,448 ng/cm2, while Cry1A.2 lacks toxicity against old-world bollworm (OWB) Helicoverpa armigera. Results from disabled insecticidal protein (DIP) bioassays suggest that receptor utilization of Cry1A.2 and Cry1B.2 proteins are distinct from each other and from current, and yet to be commercially available, Bt proteins in soy such as Cry1Ac, Cry1A.105, Cry1F.842, Cry2Ab2 and Vip3A. However, as Cry1A.2 contains a domain common to at least one commercial soybean Bt protein, resistance to this common domain in a current commercial soybean Bt protein could possibly confer at least partial cross resistance to Cry1A2. Therefore, Cry1A.2 and Cry1B.2 should provide two new tools for controlling many of the major soybean insect pests described above."
https://openalex.org/W3167598939,"Anemia remains a major public health problem for children in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Iron-rich foods consumption has a determinant role on the anemia status. Hence, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of good consumption of iron-rich foods and its associated factors among children aged 6-23 months in SSA.The recent Demographic and Health Survey data sets of thirty-five SSA countries were used. Data were analyzed using STATA/MP version 16.0 and all statistical analyses were done after weighting the data. A generalized linear mixed model using Poisson regression with robust error variance was used to determine factors associated with good consumption of iron-rich food. Association of variables was declared at a p-value of ≤0.05 and adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) ratio with its 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for each variable.The total weighted samples of 77,001 children aged 6-23 months were included. The prevalence of consumption of iron rich foods was 42.1% (95% CI: 41.78-42.48). Children with age of 12-17 (adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) = 1.96, 95% CI: 1.89-2.04) and 18-23 months (aPR = 2.05, 95% CI: 1.97-2.14), who took drugs for intestinal parasites (aPR = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.26-1.34), with postnatal check within 2 months (aPR = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.06-1.13), and children from women with ANC visit of 1-3 (aPR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.24-1.37) and ≥4 (aPR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.34-1.48) had higher prevalence of good consumption of iron rich foods. Moreover, the prevalence of consumptions of iron rich foods was higher among children from; family with rich (aPR = 1.36, 95%CI: 1.30-1.42) and middle (aPR = 1.14 95% CI: 1.09-1.19) wealth index, and mother with media exposure (aPR = 1.26, 95%CI: 1.22-1.31).The prevalence of good consumption of iron-rich foods among children aged 6-23 months in SSA countries is low. Child factors, family factors, and community-level factors were significantly associated with consumption of iron rich foods. Strategies to increase the consumption of iron-rich foods during this critical stage of growth and development should be designed in SSA."
https://openalex.org/W3168428581,"This paper provides an institutional and empirical analysis of the highly concentrated market of academic publishing, characterized by over proportionally high profit margins for publishing companies. The availability of latest research findings is an important issue for researchers, universities and politicians alike. Open access (OA) publication provides a promising but also costly solution to overcome this problem. However, in this paper we argue that OA publication costs are an important, but by far not the only way for academic publishers to gain access to public funding. In contrast, our study provides a comprehensive overview of the channels through which public expenditure benefits big academic publishing companies. Furthermore, we offer the results of an explorative case study, where we estimate the annual financial flows of public expenditures in Austria for the field of social sciences. In all, these expenditures add up to about 66.55 to 103.2 million € a year, which amounts to a fourth of total public funding for this field. Against this background, we contribute to the debate whether and to what extent public subsidies are justified for economically successful companies."
https://openalex.org/W3171063842,"Few studies have investigated the association between surgical volume and outcome of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) in an unselected cohort. We sought to investigate the association between surgical volume with peri-operative and short-term outcomes in a nation-wide, population-based study group.9,810 RARP's registered in the National Prostate Cancer Register of Sweden (2015-2018) were included. Associations between outcome and volume were analyzed with multivariable logistic regression including age, PSA-density, number of positive biopsy cores, cT stage, Gleason score, and extent of lymph node dissection.Surgeons and hospitals in the highest volume group compared to lowest group had shorter operative time; surgeon (OR 9.20, 95% CI 7.11-11.91), hospital (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.53-3.06), less blood loss; surgeon (OR 2.58. 95% CI 2.07-3.21) hospital (no difference), more often nerve sparing intention; surgeon (OR 2.89, 95% CI 2.34-3.57), hospital (OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.66-2.44), negative margins; surgeon (OR 1.90, 95% CI 1.54-2.35), hospital (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.07-1.53). There was wide range in outcome between hospitals and surgeons with similar volume that remained after adjustment.High surgeon and hospital volume were associated with better outcomes. The range in outcome was wide in all volume groups, which indicates that factors besides volume are of importance. Registration of surgical performance is essential for quality control and improvement."
https://openalex.org/W3167213792,"According to biogeography studies, the abundance and richness of soil microorganisms vary across multiple spatial scales according to soil properties and farming practices. However, soil microorganisms also exhibit poorly understood temporal variations. This study aimed at better understanding how soil microbial communities respond to changes in farming practices at a landscape scale over time. A regular grid of 269 sites was set up across a 1,200 ha farming landscape, and soil samples were characterized for their molecular microbial biomass and bacterial richness at two dates (2011 and 2016). A mapping approach highlighted that spatial microbial patterns were stable over time, while abundance and richness levels were modified. The drivers of these changes were investigated though a PLS-PM (partial least square path-modeling) approach. Soil properties were stable over time, but farming practices changed. Molecular microbial biomass was mainly driven by soil resources, whereas bacterial richness depended on both farming practices and ecological parameters. Previous-crop and management effects and a temporal dependence of the microbial community on the historical farming management were also highlighted."
https://openalex.org/W3168516017,"Tuberculosis (TB) cases have increased drastically over the last two decades and it remains as one of the deadliest infectious diseases in Malaysia. This cross-sectional study aimed to establish the spatial distribution of TB cases and its association with the sociodemographic and environmental factors in the Gombak district. The sociodemographic data of 3325 TB cases such as age, gender, race, nationality, country of origin, educational level, employment status, health care worker status, income status, residency, and smoking status from 1st January 2013 to 31st December 2017 in Gombak district were collected from the MyTB web and Tuberculosis Information System (TBIS) database at the Gombak District Health Office and Rawang Health Clinic. Environmental data consisting of air pollution such as air quality index (AQI), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ), and particulate matter 10 (PM 10 ,) were obtained from the Department of Environment Malaysia from 1st July 2012 to 31st December 2017; whereas weather data such as rainfall were obtained from the Department of Irrigation and Drainage Malaysia and relative humidity, temperature, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure were obtained from the Malaysia Meteorological Department in the same period. Global Moran’s I, kernel density estimation, Getis-Ord Gi* statistics, and heat maps were applied to identify the spatial pattern of TB cases. Ordinary least squares (OLS) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) models were used to determine the spatial association of sociodemographic and environmental factors with the TB cases. Spatial autocorrelation analysis indicated that the cases was clustered ( p &lt;0.05) over the five-year period and year 2016 and 2017 while random pattern ( p &gt;0.05) was observed from year 2013 to 2015. Kernel density estimation identified the high-density regions while Getis-Ord Gi* statistics observed hotspot locations, whereby consistently located in the southwestern part of the study area. This could be attributed to the overcrowding of inmates in the Sungai Buloh prison located there. Sociodemographic factors such as gender, nationality, employment status, health care worker status, income status, residency, and smoking status as well as; environmental factors such as AQI (lag 1), CO (lag 2), NO 2 (lag 2), SO 2 (lag 1), PM 10 (lag 5), rainfall (lag 2), relative humidity (lag 4), temperature (lag 2), wind speed (lag 4), and atmospheric pressure (lag 6) were associated with TB cases ( p &lt;0.05). The GWR model based on the environmental factors i.e. GWR2 was the best model to determine the spatial distribution of TB cases based on the highest R 2 value i.e. 0.98. The maps of estimated local coefficients in GWR models confirmed that the effects of sociodemographic and environmental factors on TB cases spatially varied. This study highlighted the importance of spatial analysis to identify areas with a high TB burden based on its associated factors, which further helps in improving targeted surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W3166486903,"Background Data on the post-acute and post-infectious complications of patients who have recovered from severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are limited. While studies report that approximately 5–15% of COVID-19 hospitalized patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation, a substantially higher number need non-invasive ventilation and are subject to prolonged hospitalizations, with long periods of immobility and isolation. The purpose of this study is to describe the post-infectious sequelae of severe viral illness and the post-acute complications of intensive care treatments in critically ill patients who have recovered from severe COVID-19 infection. Methods We performed a retrospective chart review of adult patients initially hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 infection, who recovered and were transferred to a general medical ward or discharged home between March 15, 2020 and May 15, 2020, dates inclusive, after an intensive care unit (ICU) or high dependency unit (HDU) admission in a designated COVID-19 hospital in the United Arab Emirates. Demographic data, underlying comorbidities, treatment, complications, and outcomes were collected. Descriptive statistical analyses were performed. Results Of 71 patients transferred out of ICU (n = 38, 54%) and HDU (n = 33, 46%), mean age was 48 years (SD, 9.95); 96% men; 54% under age 50. Mean ICU stay was 12.4 days (SD, 5.29), HDU stay was 13.4 days (SD, 4.53). Pre-existing conditions were not significantly associated with developing post-acute complications (Odds Ratio [OR] 1.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.41, 2.93, p = 1.00). Fifty nine percent of patients had complications; myopathy, swallowing impairments, and pressure ulcers were most common. Delirium and confusion were diagnosed in 18% (n = 13); all were admitted to the ICU and required mechanical ventilation. Of note, of all patients studied, 59.2% (n = 42/71) had at least 1 complication, 32.4% (n = 23) had at least 2 complications, and 19.7% (n = 14) suffered 3 or more sequelae. Complications were significantly more common in ICU patients (n = 33/38, 87%), compared to HDU patients (n = 9/33, 27%) (OR 17.6, 95% CI 5.23, 59.21, p &lt;0.05). Conclusion In a subset of critically ill patients who recovered from severe COVID-19 infection, there was considerable short-term post-infectious and post-acute disability. Long-term follow-up of COVID-19 survivors is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3171547923,"Unlike the majority of cancers, survival for lung cancer has not shown much improvement since the early 1970s and survival rates remain low. Genetically engineered mice tumor models are of high translational relevance as we can generate tissue specific mutations which are observed in lung cancer patients. Since these tumors cannot be detected and quantified by traditional methods, we use micro-computed tomography imaging for longitudinal evaluation and to measure response to therapy. Conventionally, we analyze microCT images of lung cancer via a manual segmentation. Manual segmentation is time-consuming and sensitive to intra- and inter-analyst variation. To overcome the limitations of manual segmentation, we set out to develop a fully-automated alternative, the Mouse Lung Automated Segmentation Tool (MLAST). MLAST locates the thoracic region of interest, thresholds and categorizes the lung field into three tissue categories: soft tissue, intermediate, and lung. An increase in the tumor burden was measured by a decrease in lung volume with a simultaneous increase in soft and intermediate tissue quantities. MLAST segmentation was validated against three methods: manual scoring, manual segmentation, and histology. MLAST was applied in an efficacy trial using a Kras/Lkb1 non-small cell lung cancer model and demonstrated adequate precision and sensitivity in quantifying tumor growth inhibition after drug treatment. Implementation of MLAST has considerably accelerated the microCT data analysis, allowing for larger study sizes and mid-study readouts. This study illustrates how automated image analysis tools for large datasets can be used in preclinical imaging to deliver high throughput and quantitative results."
https://openalex.org/W3172861568,"Introduction Evidence that supports the use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) for treatment of COVID-19 is increasingly emerging. However, very few African countries have undertaken the collection and processing of CCP. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of collecting and processing of CCP, in preparation for a randomized clinical trial of CCP for treatment of COVID-19 in Uganda. Methods In a cross-sectional study, persons with documented evidence of recovery from COVID-19 in Uganda were contacted and screened for blood donation via telephone calls. Those found eligible were asked to come to the blood donation centre for further screening and consent. Whole blood collection was undertaken from which plasma was processed. Plasma was tested for transfusion transmissible infections (TTIs) and anti-SARS CoV-2 antibody titers. SARS-CoV-2 testing was also done on nasopharyngeal swabs from the donors. Results 192 participants were contacted of whom 179 (93.2%) were eligible to donate. Of the 179 eligible, 23 (12.8%) were not willing to donate and reasons given included: having no time 7(30.4%), fear of being retained at the COVID-19 treatment center 10 (43.5%), fear of stigma in the community 1 (4.3%), phobia for donating blood 1 (4.3%), religious issues 1 (4.4%), lack of interest 2 (8.7%) and transport challenges 1 (4.3%). The median age was 30 years and females accounted for 3.7% of the donors. A total of 30 (18.5%) donors tested positive for different TTIs. Antibody titer testing demonstrated titers of more than 1:320 for all the 72 samples tested. Age greater than 46 years and female gender were associated with higher titers though not statistically significant. Conclusion CCP collection and processing is possible in Uganda. However, concerns about stigma and lack of time, interest or transport need to be addressed in order to maximize donations."
https://openalex.org/W3165909980,"One of the most crucial elements for the long-term success of shared transportation systems (bikes, cars etc.) is their ubiquitous availability. To achieve this, and avoid having stations with no available vehicle, service operators rely on rebalancing. While different operators have different approaches to this functionality, overall it requires a demand-supply analysis of the various stations. While trip data can be used for this task, the existing methods in the literature only capture the observed demand and supply rates. However, the excess demand rates (e.g., how many customers attempted to rent a bike from an empty station) are not recorded in these data, but they are important for the in-depth understanding of the systems' demand patterns that ultimately can inform operations like rebalancing. In this work we propose a method to estimate the excess demand and supply rates from trip and station availability data. Key to our approach is identifying what we term as excess demand pulse (EDP) in availability data as a signal for the existence of excess demand. We then proceed to build a Skellam regression model that is able to predict the difference between the total demand and supply at a given station during a specific time period. Our experiments with real data further validate the accuracy of our proposed method."
https://openalex.org/W3167041284,"Real World Evidence (RWE) and its uses are playing a growing role in medical research and inference. Prominently, the 21st Century Cures Act-approved in 2016 by the US Congress-permits the introduction of RWE for the purpose of risk-benefit assessments of medical interventions. However, appraising the quality of RWE and determining its inferential strength are, more often than not, thorny problems, because evidence production methodologies may suffer from multiple imperfections. The problem arises to aggregate multiple appraised imperfections and perform inference with RWE. In this article, we thus develop an evidence appraisal aggregation algorithm called EA3. Our algorithm employs the softmax function-a generalisation of the logistic function to multiple dimensions-which is popular in several fields: statistics, mathematical physics and artificial intelligence. We prove that EA3 has a number of desirable properties for appraising RWE and we show how the aggregated evidence appraisals computed by EA3 can support causal inferences based on RWE within a Bayesian decision making framework. We also discuss features and limitations of our approach and how to overcome some shortcomings. We conclude with a look ahead at the use of RWE."
https://openalex.org/W3168839952,"The mechanism of pathogenesis associated with APOL1 polymorphisms and risk for non-diabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) is not fully understood. Prior studies have minimized a causal role for the circulating APOL1 protein, thus efforts to understand kidney pathogenesis have focused on APOL1 expressed in renal cells. Of the kidney cells reported to express APOL1, the proximal tubule expression patterns are inconsistent in published reports, and whether APOL1 is synthesized by the proximal tubule or possibly APOL1 protein in the blood is filtered and reabsorbed by the proximal tubule remains unclear. Using both protein and mRNA in situ methods, the kidney expression pattern of APOL1 was examined in normal human and APOL1 bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mice with and without proteinuria. APOL1 protein and mRNA was detected in podocytes and endothelial cells, but not in tubular epithelia. In the setting of proteinuria, plasma APOL1 protein did not appear to be filtered or reabsorbed by the proximal tubule. A side-by-side examination of commercial antibodies used in prior studies suggest the original reports of APOL1 in proximal tubules likely reflects antibody non-specificity. As such, APOL1 expression in podocytes and endothelia should remain the focus for mechanistic studies in the APOL1-mediated kidney diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3169003085,"Objectives To evaluate the agreement in detecting pulmonary perfusion defects in patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension using dual-energy CT and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. Second, to compare both imaging modalities in monitoring lung perfusion changes in these patients after undergoing pulmonary endarterectomy. Methods 20 patients were examined with CT and MRI before and/or after pulmonary endarterectomy. Estimated perfusion defect percentage from both modalities was compared in a lobe-based analysis. Spatial agreement of perfusion defect maps was also assessed. Results A significant correlation between CT and MRI based perfusion defect percentage was calculated in all lung lobes (r &gt; 0.78; p &lt; 0.001). In addition, a good spatial agreement between perfusion defect maps was found (mean spatial overlap for the whole lung was 68.2%; SD = 6.9). Both CT and MRI detected improvements in pulmonary perfusion after pulmonary endarterectomy: 8% and 7% decrease in whole lung perfusion defect percentage (p = 0.007 and 0.004), respectively. In a lobe-wise analysis, improvements were statistically significant only in lower lobes using both modalities (reduction in defect percentage ranged from 16–29%; p &lt; 0.02). Conclusions Dual-energy CT is an alternative to MRI in monitoring chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Both imaging modalities provided comparable estimations of perfusion defects and could detect similar improvement in lung perfusion after pulmonary endarterectomy."
https://openalex.org/W3170896012,"Objective Pre- and post-operative neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and prognostic nutritional index (PNI) and other prognostic clinicopathological variables were correlated with progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) patients. Methods GBM patients (n = 87, single-centre, recruited 2013–2019) were retrospectively divided into low and high groups using literature-derived cut-offs (NLR = 5.07, PNI = 46.97). Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log rank tests assessed PFS and OS. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified PFS and OS prognosticators. Results High vs low post-operative PNI cohort was associated with longer PFS (279 vs 136 days, p = 0.009), but significance was lost on multivariate analysis. Post-operative ECOG ( p = 0.043), daily dexamethasone ( p = 0.023) and IDH mutation ( p = 0.046) were significant on multivariate analysis for PFS. High pre- and post-operative PNI were associated with improved OS (384 vs 114 days, p = 0.034 and 516 vs 245 days, p = 0.001, respectively). Low postoperative NLR correlated with OS (408 vs 249 days, p = 0.029). On multivariate analysis using forward selection process, extent of resection (EOR) (GTR vs biopsy, p = 0.004 and STR vs biopsy, p = 0.011), and any previous surgery ( p = 0.014) were independent prognostic biomarkers for OS. On multivariate analysis of these latter variables with literature-derived prognostic biomarkers, EOR remained significantly associated with OS ( p = 0.037). Conclusions EOR, followed by having any surgery prior to GBM, are the most significant independent predictors of GBM patient’s OS. Post-operative ECOG, daily dexamethasone and IDH mutation are independent prognostic biomarkers for PFS. PNI may be superior to NLR. Post- vs pre-operative serum inflammatory marker levels may be associated with survival."
https://openalex.org/W3172267431,"Rising prevalence of diabetes in sub-Saharan Africa, coupled with continued malaria transmission, has resulted more patients dealing with both communicable and non-communicable diseases. We previously reported that travelers with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) infected with Plasmodium falciparum were three times more likely to develop severe malaria than non-diabetics. Here we explore the biological basis for this by testing blood from uninfected subjects with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, ex vivo, for their effects on parasite growth and rosetting (binding of infected erythrocytes to uninfected erythrocytes). Rosetting was associated with type 2 diabetes, blood glucose and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), while parasite growth was positively associated with blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), body mass index (BMI), fibrinogen and triglycerides. This study establishes a link between diabetes and malaria virulence assays, potentially explaining the protective effect of good glycemic control against severe malaria in subjects with diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W3172457085,"Although it is considered that two heads are better than one, related studies argued that groups rarely outperform their best members. This study examined not only whether two heads are better than one but also whether three heads are better than two or one in the context of two-armed bandit problems where learning plays an instrumental role in achieving high performance. This research revealed that a U-shaped correlation exists between performance and group size. The performance was highest for either individuals or triads, but the lowest for dyads. Moreover, this study estimated learning properties and determined that high inverse temperature (exploitation) accounted for high performance. In particular, it was shown that group effects regarding the inverse temperatures in dyads did not generate higher values to surpass the averages of their two group members. In contrast, triads gave rise to higher values of the inverse temperatures than their averages of their individual group members. These results were consistent with our proposed hypothesis that learning coherence is likely to emerge in individuals and triads, but not in dyads, which in turn leads to higher performance. This hypothesis is based on the classical argument by Simmel stating that while dyads are likely to involve more emotion and generate greater variability, triads are the smallest structure which tends to constrain emotions, reduce individuality, and generate behavioral convergences or uniformity because of the ''two against one"" social pressures. As a result, three heads or one head were better than two in our study."

The efficacy of SERDs continues to be questioned by healthcare professionals, with concerns about poor dietary adherence. This study explored facilitators and barriers to dietary adherence and program attrition among people with class III obesity who had attempted or completed a SERD in a specialised weight loss clinic. Participants who commenced a SERD between January 2016 to May 2018 were invited to participate. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted from September to October 2018 with 20 participants (12 women and 8 men). Weight change and recounted events were validated using the participants’ medical records. Data were analysed by thematic analysis using line-by-line inductive coding. The mean age ± SD of participants was 51.2 ± 11.3 years, with mean ± SD BMI at baseline 63.7 ± 12.6 kg/m 2 . Five themes emerged from participants’ recounts that were perceived to facilitate dietary adherence: (1.1) SERD program group counselling and psychoeducation sessions, (1.2) emotionally supportive clinical staff and social networks that accommodated and championed change in dietary behaviours, (1.3) awareness of eating behaviours and the relationship between these and progression of disease, (1.4) a resilient mindset, and (1.5) dietary simplicity, planning and self-monitoring. There were five themes on factors perceived to be barriers to adherence, namely: (2.1) product unpalatability, (2.2) unrealistic weight loss expectations, (2.3) poor program accessibility, (2.4) unforeseeable circumstances and (2.5) externalised weight-related stigma. This study highlights opportunities where SERD programs can be optimised to facilitate dietary adherence and reduce barriers, thus potentially improving weight loss outcomes with such programs. Prior to the commencement of a SERD program, healthcare professionals facilitating such programs could benefit from reviewing participants to identify common barriers. This includes identifying the presence of product palatability issues, unrealistic weight loss expectations, socio-economic disadvantage, and behaviour impacting experiences of externalised weight-related stigma."
https://openalex.org/W3169926498,"Fluoride (F) is a naturally exists in nature but several studies have indicated it as an environmental toxicant to all leaving beings. Human F exposure has increased over the years since this ion has been used by industry on foods, beverages, toothpastes and on water supply. Although F is safe at optimal concentrations in water supply, human exposure to high levels could trigger neurofunctional deficits.In this study, human glial-like (U87) and neuronal-like (IMR-32) cells lineages were used to access F toxicity and CNS cell sensibility on both cell facing the same protocol. Cells were exposed to F over 3, 5 and 10 days on two different F concentrations. Fluoride exposed cells were evaluated by standard toxicity assays to cell viability, apoptosis, necrosis and general cell metabolism. Oxidative stress parameters were evaluated by ATP and ROS levels, lipid peroxidation, GSH/GSSG ratio and comet assay.No changes were observed in IMR-32 at any given time while after 10 days of exposure to 0.22μg/mL, U87 glial-like cells showed signs of toxicity such as decreased cell viability by necrosis while general cell metabolism was increased. Oxidative stress parameters were next evaluated only on U87 glial-like cells after 10 days of exposure. F induced a decrease on ATP levels while no changes were observed on reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation. GSH/GSSG ratio was decreased followed by DNA damage both on 0.22μg/mL F.Our results suggest an important differential behavior of the distinct types of cells exposed to the different fluoride concentrations, pointing that the U87 glial-like cells as more susceptible to damage triggered by this ion."
https://openalex.org/W3172280019,"Background In the absence of universal testing, effective therapies, or vaccines, identifying risk factors for viral infection, particularly readily modifiable exposures and behaviors, is required to identify effective strategies against viral infection and transmission. Methods We conducted a world-wide mobile application-based prospective cohort study available to English speaking adults with a smartphone. We collected self-reported characteristics, exposures, and behaviors, as well as smartphone-based geolocation data. Our main outcome was incident symptoms of viral infection, defined as fevers and chills plus one other symptom previously shown to occur with SARS-CoV-2 infection, determined by daily surveys. Findings Among 14, 335 participants residing in all 50 US states and 93 different countries followed for a median 21 days (IQR 10–26 days), 424 (3%) developed incident viral symptoms. In pooled multivariable logistic regression models, female biological sex (odds ratio [OR] 1.75, 95% CI 1.39–2.20, p&lt;0.001), anemia (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.16–1.81, p = 0.001), hypertension (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.08–1.68, p = 0.007), cigarette smoking in the last 30 days (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.35–2.55, p&lt;0.001), any viral symptoms among household members 6–12 days prior (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.67–2.55, p&lt;0.001), and the maximum number of individuals the participant interacted with within 6 feet in the past 6–12 days (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.06–1.25, p&lt;0.001) were each associated with a higher risk of developing viral symptoms. Conversely, a higher subjective social status (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.83–0.93, p&lt;0.001), at least weekly exercise (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.47–0.70, p&lt;0.001), and sanitizing one’s phone (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63–0.99, p = 0.037) were each associated with a lower risk of developing viral symptoms. Interpretation While several immutable characteristics were associated with the risk of developing viral symptoms, multiple immediately modifiable exposures and habits that influence risk were also observed, potentially identifying readily accessible strategies to mitigate risk in the COVID-19 era."
https://openalex.org/W3166619785,"We have previously reported that the 26-amino acid N-terminus stalk region of soluble Fas ligand (sFasL), which is separate from its binding site, is required for its biological function. Here we investigate the mechanisms that link the structure of the sFasL stalk region with its function. Using site-directed mutagenesis we cloned a mutant form of sFasL in which all the charged amino acids of the stalk region were changed to neutral alanines (mut-sFasL). We used the Fas-sensitive Jurkat T-cell line and mouse and human alveolar epithelial cells to test the bioactivity of sFasL complexes, using caspase-3 activity and Annexin-V externalization as readouts. Finally, we tested the effects of mut-sFasL on lipopolysaccharide-induced lung injury in mice. We found that mutation of all the 8 charged amino acids of the stalk region into the non-charged amino acid alanine (mut-sFasL) resulted in reduced apoptotic activity compared to wild type sFasL (WT-sFasL). The mut-sFasL attenuated WT-sFasL function on the Fas-sensitive human T-cell line Jurkat and on primary human small airway epithelial cells. The inhibitory mechanism was associated with the formation of complexes of mut-sFasL with the WT protein. Intratracheal administration of the mut-sFasL to mice 24 hours after intratracheal Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide resulted in attenuation of the inflammatory response 24 hours later. Therefore, the stalk region of sFasL has a critical role on bioactivity, and changes in the structure of the stalk region can result in mutant variants that interfere with the wild type protein function in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W3169164878,"Education is associated with later health, and notably with an indicator of physiological health measuring the cost of adapting to stressful conditions, named allostatic load. Education is itself the result of a number of upstream variables. We examined the origins of educational attainment through the lens of interactions between families and school i.e. parents' interest in their child's education as perceived by teachers. This study aims to examine whether parental interest during a child's educational trajectory is associated with subsequent allostatic load, and whether education or other pathways mediate this relationship. We used data from 9 377 women and men born in 1958 in Great Britain and included in the National Child Development Study to conduct secondary data analyses. Parental interest was measured from questionnaire responses by teachers collected at age 7, 11 and 16. Allostatic load was defined using 14 biomarkers assayed in blood from a biosample collected at 44 years of age. Linear regression analyses were carried out on a sample of 8 113 participants with complete data for allostatic load, missing data were imputed. Participants whose parents were considered to be uninterested in their education by their teacher had a higher allostatic load on average in midlife in both men (β = 0,41 [0,29; 0,54]) and women (β = 0,69 [0,54; 0,83]). We examined the role of the educational and other pathways including psychosocial, material/financial, and behavioral variables, as potential mediators in the relationship between parental interest and allostatic load. The direct link between parental interest and allostatic load was completely mediated in men, but only partially mediated in women. This work provides evidence that parents' interest in their child's education as perceived by teachers is associated with subsequent physiological health in mid-life and may highlight a form of cultural dissonance between family and educational spheres."
https://openalex.org/W3170873740,"Cannabidiol (CBD) confers therapeutic effects in some neurological disorders via modulation of inflammatory, oxidative and cell-signalling pathways. However, CBD is lipophilic and highly photooxidative with low oral bioavailability in plasma and brain. In this study, we aimed to design and test a CBD microencapsulation method as a drug delivery strategy to improve the absorption of CBD. Additionally, we evaluated the brain uptake of CBD capsules when administered alongside capsules containing a permeation-modifying bile acid, deoxycholic acid (DCA).Microcapsules containing either CBD or DCA were formed using the ionic gelation method with 1.5% sodium alginate formulations and 100 mM calcium chloride. C57BL/6J wild type mice randomly assigned to three treatment groups (3-4 mice per group) were administered CBD in the following preparations: 1) CBD capsules, 2) CBD capsules + DCA capsules and 3) naked CBD oil (control). To assess the short-term bioavailability of CBD, plasma and brain samples were collected at 0.3, 1 and 3 hours post administration and CBD levels were analysed with liquid chromatography mass spectrometer.We produced spherical capsules at 400 ± 50 μm in size. The CBD capsules were calculated to have a drug loading of 2% and an encapsulation efficiency of 23%. Mice that received CBD capsules + DCA capsules showed a 40% and 47% increase in CBD plasma concentration compared to mice on CBD capsules and naked CBD oil, respectively. Furthermore, the CBD capsules + DCA capsules group showed a 48% and 25% increase in CBD brain concentration compared to mice on CBD capsules and naked CBD oil, respectively. In mice treated with CBD capsules + DCA capsules, the brain CBD concentration peaked at 0.3 hours with a 300% increased availability compared to CBD capsules and naked CBD oil groups, which peaked at 1 hour after administration.The microencapsulation method combined with a permeation enhancer, DCA increased the short-term bioavailability of CBD in plasma and brain."

Investors are interested in research examining the factors that can affect the team value. The aim of this research is to investigate the factors that affect the NBA team values. The value of a team can be influenced not only by performance-based variables, but also by macroeconomic indicators and demographic statistics. Data, analyzed in this study, contains of game statistics, economic variables and demographic statistics of the 30 teams in the NBA for the 2013–2020 seasons. Firstly, Pearson correlation test was implemented in order to identify the related variables. NBA teams’ characteristics and similarities were assessed with Machine Learning techniques (K-means and Hierarchical clustering). Secondly, Ordinary linear regression (OLS), fixed effect and random effect models were implemented in the statistical analyses. The models were compared based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Fixed effect model with one lag was found the most effective model and our model produced consistently good results with the R 2 statistics of 0.974. In the final model, we found that the significant determinants of team value at the NBA team level are revenue, GDP, championship, population and key player. In contrast, the total number of turnovers has a negative impact on team value. These findings would be beneficial to coaches and managers to improve their strategies to increase their teams’ value."
https://openalex.org/W3171803660,"Social network analysis is increasingly applied to understand animal groups. However, it is rarely feasible to observe every interaction among all individuals in natural populations. Studies have assessed how missing information affects estimates of individual network positions, but less attention has been paid to metrics that characterize overall network structure such as modularity, clustering coefficient, and density. In cases such as groups displaying fission-fusion dynamics, where subgroups break apart and rejoin in changing conformations, missing information may affect estimates of global network structure differently than in groups with distinctly separated communities due to the influence single individuals can have on the connectivity of the network. Using a bat maternity group showing fission-fusion dynamics, we quantify the effect of missing data on global network measures including community detection. In our system, estimating the number of communities was less reliable than detecting community structure. Further, reliably assorting individual bats into communities required fewer individuals and fewer observations per individual than to estimate the number of communities. Specifically, our metrics of global network structure (i.e., graph density, clustering coefficient, Rcom) approached the 'real' values with increasing numbers of observations per individual and, as the number of individuals included increased, the variance in these estimates decreased. Similar to previous studies, we recommend that more observations per individual should be prioritized over including more individuals when resources are limited. We recommend caution when making conclusions about animal social networks when a substantial number of individuals or observations are missing, and when possible, suggest subsampling large datasets to observe how estimates are influenced by sampling intensity. Our study serves as an example of the reliability, or lack thereof, of global network measures with missing information, but further work is needed to determine how estimates will vary with different data collection methods, network structures, and sampling periods."

However, the specific trade-off consumer face when asked to substitute a red meat dish is scarcely researched, often neglecting the bouquet of substitution options and/or the price component involved. Four substitution strategies are evaluated within an individually adapted choice based conjoint: the substitution by (1) the same red meat dishes with a halved meat portion size, (2) novel plant-based products that mimic the functionality and taste, (3) authentic plant-based components that just mimic the functionality, and (4) vegetarian dishes that just neglect the meat component if still familiar to consumers. The analysis is executed for three popular red meat dishes to account for consistency across meal scenarios, namely Meatballs, Spaghetti Bolognese and Sausage Buns. The analysis is sensitive to red meat consumption habits to better understand the preferences of consumers that can actually substitute a red meat intake."
https://openalex.org/W3168044897,"Iodine status, including Iodine Deficiency (ID) of the children aged 12-59 months of Jaffna District, Sri Lanka, have never been studied. This study thus aimed to assess ID among children aged 12-59 months by monitoring the Urinary Iodine Concentrations (UIC), the prevalence of goitre, and the factors causing ID.A cross-sectional study was conducted among 846 children aged 12-59 months in Jaffna District, Sri Lanka. Sociodemographic characteristics and other factors were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Dietary pattern of children was obtained using semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. We performed urinary iodine estimation and physical examinations to detect the goitre, according to the World Health Organization criteria. A multivariate logistic linear regression model was used to identify the factors that causing ID.The median UIC was 146.4 μg/L (interquartile range = 112.6-185.3 μg/L). Based on the UIC (<100 μg/L), 17.8% had ID, of which 15.7% and 2.1% had mild and moderate ID. The mean consumption of iodine from food was 128.7 (±20.2) μg/day. Gender variation had no influence on ID (p>0.05). Median UIC was significantly associated with living area, wealth status, type of drinking water, and method of iodized salt usage. A higher percentage of ID was significantly associated with younger age [AOR 2.32 (95% CI: 1.31-4.10)], urban area [AOR 1.94 (95% CI 1.27-2.96)], inland regions [AOR 3.20 (95% CI 1.85-5.55)], improper method of iodized salt usage [AOR 3.63 (95% CI: 1.38-9.56)], and low consumption of iodine-containing foods. The neck palpation revealed that only three children had goitre (0.4%).This study revealed that high ID among the children in Jaffna children was due to improper usage of iodized salt, even though the iodized salt is freely available in the region, living area, and age, while the prevalence of goitre was not significantly identified as a public health problem."
https://openalex.org/W3169844494,"Suboptimal cataract surgery outcomes remain a challenge in most developing countries. In Ghana, about 2 million people have been reported to be blind due to cataract with about 20% new cases being recorded yearly. The aim of this study was to evaluate postoperative correction of refractive errors after cataract surgery in a selected eye hospital in Ashanti Region, Ghana. This was a retrospective study where medical records of patients (aged 40-100) who reported to an eye hospital in Ghana from 2013-2018 were reviewed. Included in the study were patients aged ≥40 years and patients with complete records. Data on patient demographics, type of surgery, intra-ocular lens (PCIOL) power, availability of biometry, postoperative refraction outcomes, pre- and postoperative visual acuity were analyzed. Data of two hundred and thirteen eyes of 190 patients who met the inclusion criteria were analyzed. Descriptive analysis and Chi-square test were carried out to determine the mean, median, standard deviation and relevant associations. The mean ± SD age was 67.21±12.2 years (51.2% were females). Small Incision Cataract Surgery (99.5%) with 100% IOL implants was the main cataract surgery procedure in this study. Pre-operative biometry was performed for 38.9% of all patients on their first eye surgery and 41.5% for second eye surgeries. About 71% eyes in this study were blind (presenting VA<3/60) before surgery; 40.4% had post-operative VA <3/60. Pre-existing ocular comorbidities discovered post- surgery, attributed to suboptimal visual outcomes. More than half (55.3%) of patients did not undergo postoperative refraction due to loss to follow-up. Year of surgery (p = .017), follow up visits< 2months (p < .0001) and discovered comorbidity post-surgery (p = .035) were the factors significantly associated with postoperative refraction. Myopia and compound myopic astigmatism were the dominant refractive error outcomes. The timing of post-operative refraction had a significant effect on postoperative refraction done. These findings indicate a clinically meaningful significance between completion of postoperative care and postoperative refraction done. Consequently, with settings in most developing countries, where less biometry is done, it is appropriate that post-operative refractive services are encouraged and done earlier to enhance the patients' expectations while increasing cataract surgery patronage."

The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes using FPG and HbA1c and to examine their relationships with obesity and other risk factors in young female Emirati college students.In this cross-sectional study we recruited 555 female college students aged 17-25, enrolled at United Arab Emirates University in Al Ain, UAE. Anthropometric analysis, blood pressure, and various biochemical markers were measured using standard methods. Type 2 Diabetes, impaired fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and elevated HbA1c levels were examined in the study population as per the standards of medical care in diabetes, set out by the American Diabetes Association in 2020.Based on the HbA1c test, the prevalence of pre-diabetes and diabetes were 24% and 8.6%, respectively. Based on the FPG test, the prevalence of pre-diabetes and diabetes were 9.2% and 0.5%, respectively. The kappa statistic of concordance between HbA1c and FPG was 0.287, P < 0.001. Abnormal glycemic status was significantly associated with decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level (< 50 mg/dl) (p = 0.002) and elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP) level (≥ 2.0 mg/L) (P < 0.001).Using FPG to evaluate glycemic control seems to underestimate the burden of undiagnosed diabetes which could have a significant impact on clinical practice. Our data indicates an association between abnormal glycemic status with HDL and Hs-CRP. Further evaluation is needed to assess the impact of using HbA1c as a diagnostic test for diabetes in the UAE."
https://openalex.org/W3171914455,"The communication and reproduction of insects are driven by chemical sensing. During this process, chemical compounds are transported across the sensillum lymph to the sensory neurons assisted by different types of soluble binding proteins: odorant-binding proteins (OBPs); chemosensory proteins (CSPs); some members of ML-family proteins (MD-2 (myeloid differentiation factor-2)-related Lipid-recognition), also known as NPC2-like proteins. Potential transcripts involved in chemosensing were identified by an in silico analysis of whole-body female and male transcriptomes of the parasitic wasp Diachasmimorpha longicaudata. This analysis facilitated the characterization of fourteen OBPs (all belonging to the Classic type), seven CSPs (and two possible isoforms), and four NPC2-like proteins. A differential expression analysis by qPCR showed that eleven of these proteins (CSPs 2 and 8, OBPs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11, and NPC2b) were over-expressed in female antenna and two (CSP 1 and OBP 12) in the body without antennae. Foraging behavior trials (linked to RNA interference) suggest that OBPs 9, 10, and 11 are potentially involved in the female orientation to chemical cues associated with the host. OBP 12 seems to be related to physiological processes of female longevity regulation. In addition, transcriptional silencing of CSP 3 showed that this protein is potentially associated with the regulation of foraging behavior. This study supports the hypothesis that soluble binding proteins are potentially linked to fundamental physiological processes and behaviors in D. longicaudata. The results obtained here contribute useful information to increase the parasitoid performance as a biological control agent of fruit fly pest species."

Subjects/Methods Retrospective chart review of existing medical records. Data collected included intraocular pressure (IOP) and IOP-lowering medication use preoperatively and through up to 24 months postoperatively. Paired t-tests were utilized to compare preoperative to postoperative mean IOP and mean medications used. Results Data from 32 eyes of 26 subjects were analyzed. Subjects were predominantly Caucasian (25/26) had mean (standard error) age of 79.3 (1.2) years, and eyes had moderate-advanced OAG (mean visual field mean deviation -8.3 [1.3] dB). Mean IOP was 19.8 (0.8) mmHg at baseline and 15.5 (0.6) mmHg (p&lt;0.0001) after mean follow-up of 11.5 (1.0) months; IOP reductions of ≥20% were achieved in 20/32 eyes (62.5%). Mean medication use declined from 2.4 (0.2) medications per eye at baseline to 0.5 (0.2) at last follow-up (p&lt;0.0001); 23/32 eyes (71.9%) were medication-free at last follow-up. No vision-threatening complications were observed. Conclusions Combined phacoemulsification and ab interno trabeculectomy with the KDB safely provided mean IOP reductions of 21.7% and mean IOP medication reductions of 83% after mean follow-up of 12 months in eyes with moderate to advanced OAG. This procedure provides medication-independence in most eyes with statistically and clinically significant IOP reductions."

This study tests a multilevel model of analysis of risk factors in the appearance of musculoskeletal pain and discomfort in computer workers that integrates indicators from different areas: temporal usage patterns, ergonomic factors, psychosocial factors, and individual variables, specifically testing the possible mediating role of the mental workload. A cross-sectional study was performed through online registration with a non-probabilistic sample of 1198 workers from Spanish organizations. The results show that mental workload has a higher association than the rest of the factors with the onset of pain and discomfort in various body areas: neck in men, neck, shoulders and upper back in women. They also support the mediation role of mental workload in the relationship between usage patterns and the appearance of musculoskeletal symptoms. The use of multilevel theoretical models that adequately consider the complexity of the relationships between the different risk factors is necessary for a better understanding and intervention on MSSs in computer workers."

Athletes who were substance users had higher symptoms of depression than non-users (p = 0.04; Hedge's g = 0.81). RsFC differences were observed between users and non-users in orbital frontal cortex (OFC) and bilateral hippocampal seeds, and negative associations between depression symptoms and rsFC in the left hippocampus and posterior cingulate cortex were observed in cannabis users. In female athletes, substance use is associated with greater self-reported depression symptoms and altered rsFC in self-monitoring and emotional regulation regions of the brain."

In spite of the problem, studies conducted on the associated factors of births protected against neonatal tetanus are scarce in Africa. Therefore, this study aimed to identify both individual and community-level factors associated with births protected against neonatal tetanus in the region.The most recent Demographic and Health Survey datasets of five African countries (Ethiopia, Burundi, Comoros, Zimbabwe and Zambia) were used to investigate the associated factors of births protected from neonatal tetanus. STATA Version 14 statistical software was used for the analysis. The data were weighted before doing any statistical analysis and deviance was used for model comparison. Multilevel binary logistic regression was used to identify the associated factors of births protected against neonatal tetanus. Finally, the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with its 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for each potential factors included in the multivariable multilevel logistic regression model.A total weighted sample of 30897 reproductive age women who had a birth within 5 years preceding the survey were included in the analysis. Those women with age of 20-34 (AOR = 1.32, 95%CI: 1.18-1.48) and 35-49 years (AOR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.10-1.44), high community level of women education (AOR = 1.13, 95%CI: 1.04-1.23), being from poorer(AOR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.14-1.33), middle (AOR = 1.31, 95%CI: 1.21-1.43), richer (AOR = 1.21, 95%CI: 1.11-1.32) and richest households (AOR = 1.59, 95%CI: 1.44-1.74), having antenatal care follow up (AOR = 9.62, 95% CI: 8.79-10.54), not perceiving distance to health facility as a big problem (AOR = 1.18, 95% CI: (1.11-1.25) had higher odds of having births protected against neonatal tetanus.Both individual and community level factors were found to be associated with births protected against neonatal tetanus in Africa. This suggests that a variety of factors are affecting births protected against neonatal tetanus in the region. Hence, the impact of these factors should be recognized while developing strategies to reduce neonatal tetanus in the region."
https://openalex.org/W3169110327,"Theoretically, small molecule CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6is) represent a logical therapeutic option in non-small cell lung cancers since most of these malignancies have wildtype RB, the key target of CDKs and master regulator of the cell cycle. Unfortunately, CDK4/6is are found to have limited clinical activity as single agents in non-small cell lung cancer. To address this problem and to identify effective CDK4/6i combinations, we screened a library of targeted agents for efficacy in four non-small cell lung cancer lines treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors Palbociclib or Abemaciclib. The pan-PAK (p21-activated kinase) inhibitor PF03758309 emerged as a promising candidate with viability ratios indicating synergy in all 4 cell lines and for both CDK4/6is. It is noteworthy that the PAKs are downstream effectors of small GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42 and are overexpressed in a wide variety of cancers. Individually the compounds primarily induced cell cycle arrest; however, the synergistic combination induced apoptosis, accounting for the synergy. Surprisingly, while the pan-PAK inhibitor PF03758309 synergizes with CDK4/6is, no synergy occurs with group I PAK inhibitors FRAX486 or FRAX597. Cell lines treated only with Ribociclib, FRAX486 or FRAX597 underwent G1/G0 arrest, whereas combination treatment with these compounds predominantly resulted in autophagy. Combining high concentrations of FRAX486, which weakly inhibits PAK4, and Ribociclib, mimics the autophagy and apoptotic effect of PF03758309 combined with Ribociclib. FRAX597, a PAKi that does not inhibit PAK4 did not reduce autophagy in combination with Ribociclib. Our results suggest that a unique combination of PAKs plays a crucial role in the synergy of PAK inhibitors with CDK4/6i. Targeting this unique PAK combination, could greatly improve the efficacy of CDK4/6i and broaden the spectrum of cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3169654924,"In March of 2020, the United States was confronted with a major public health crisis caused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This study aimed to identify what factors influence adherence to recently implemented public health measures such as mask-wearing and social distancing, trust of scientific organizations like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) on information pertaining to the pandemic, and level of perceived risk. Data were collected from June 30, 2020 to July 22, 2020 on 951 adult residents of the United States using an online survey through Microsoft Forms. Multiple linear regression was used to identify the strongest predictors for compliance to pandemic-related health measures, trust in the scientific community, and perceived risk. Results showed that the strongest predictor of all variables of interest was degree of policy liberalism. Additionally, participants who consumed more conservative news media conformed less to the pandemic health guidelines and had less trust in the scientific community. Degree of policy liberalism was found to have a significant moderating effect on the relationship between gender and conformity to pandemic-related health behaviors. These findings have concerning implications that factors like degree of policy liberalism and source of news are more influential in predicting adherence to life-saving health measures than established risk factors like pre-existing health conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3171184551,"Understanding the spread of infectious diseases is an extremely essential step to preventing them. Thus, correct modeling and simulation approaches are critical for elucidating the transmission of infectious diseases and improving the control of epidemics. The primary objective of this study is to simulate the spread of communicable diseases in an urban rail transit station. Data were collected by a field investigation in the city of Ningbo, China. A SEIR-based model was developed to simulate the spread of infectious diseases in Tianyi station, considering four groups of passengers (susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered) and a 14-day incubation period. Based on the historical data of infectious diseases, the parameters of the SEIR infectious disease model were clarified, and a sensitivity analysis of the parameters was also performed. The results showed that the contact rate (CR), infectivity (I), and average illness duration (AID) were positively correlated with the number of infections. It was also found that the length of the average incubation time (AIT) was positively correlated with the number of exposed individuals and negatively correlated with the number of infectors. These simulation results provide support for the validity and reliability of using the SEIR model in studies of the spread of epidemics and facilitate the development of effective measures to prevent and control an epidemic."
https://openalex.org/W3171270350,"The Delft Self-Grasping Hand is an adjustable passive prosthesis operated using the concept of tenodesis (where opening and closing of the hand is mechanically linked to the flexion and extension of the wrist). As a purely mechanical device that does not require harnessing, the Self-Grasping Hand offers a promising alternative to current prostheses. However, the contralateral hand is almost always required to operate the mechanism to release a grasp and is sometimes also used to help form the grasp; hence limiting the time it is available for other purposes. In this study we quantified the amount of time the contralateral hand was occupied with operating the Self-Grasping Hand, classified as either direct or indirect interaction, and investigated how these periods changed with practice. We studied 10 anatomically intact participants learning to use the Self-Grasping Hand fitted to a prosthesis simulator. The learning process involved 10 repeats of a feasible subset of the tasks in the Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure (SHAP). Video footage was analysed, and the time that the contralateral hand was engaged in grasping or releasing was calculated. Functionality scores increased for all participants, plateauing at an Index of Functionality of 33.5 after 5 SHAP attempts. Contralateral hand involvement reduced significantly from 6.47 (first 3 attempts) to 4.68 seconds (last three attempts), but as a proportion of total task time remained relatively steady (increasing from 29% to 32%). For 9/10 participants most of this time was supporting the initiation of grasps rather than releases. The reliance on direct or indirect interactions between the contralateral hand and the prosthesis varied between participants but appeared to remain relatively unchanged with practice. Future studies should consider evaluating the impact of reliance on the contralateral limb in day-to-day life and development of suitable training methods."
https://openalex.org/W3167039495,"The Brief Self-Report Questionnaire for Screening Putative Pre-Psychotic States (BQSPS), a brief, self-reported screening tool for risk of psychosis, can detect auditory perceptual disturbances significantly associated with perceived need for psychological services among young adults. However, the relationship is largely explained by the existence of neurotic traits, anxiety and depression symptoms.This study explores possible explanations of previous results from factor structures of the BQSPS and the clinical implications underlying each factor.Construct validity, criterion-related validity, discriminant validity, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability of the BQSPS are determined among young adults (N = 289).We find that Social Anxiety, Positive Symptoms, and Negative Symptoms are three components in the BQSPS for young adults. Moreover, we find that each component of the BQSPS can be explained by related forms of psychopathology, self-esteem, or personality traits. Finally, the BQSPS can satisfactorily distinguish cases from non-cases using the Symptoms Check List-90-Revised.We clarify the clinical implications of each component of the BQSPS and thus expand its clinical utility. The BQSPS has good psychometric properties in young adults from an ethnically Chinese population. Limitations and directions for future research are also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3167758087,"Anopheles albitarsis F is a putative species belonging to the Albitarsis Complex, recognized by rDNA, mtDNA, partial white gene, and microsatellites sequences. It has been reported from the island of Trinidad, Venezuela and Colombia, and incriminated as a vector of malaria parasites in the latter. This study examined mitochondrially encoded cytochrome c oxidase I (MT-CO1) sequences of An. albitarsis F from malaria-endemic areas in Colombia and Venezuela to understand its relations with other members of the Complex, revised and update the geographical distribution and bionomics of An. albitarsis F and explore hypotheses to explain its phylogenetic relationships and geographical expansion. Forty-five MT-CO1 sequences obtained in this study were analyzed to estimate genetic diversity and possible evolutionary relationships. Sequences generated 37 haplotypes clustered in a group where the genetic divergence of Venezuelan populations did not exceed 1.6% with respect to Colombian samples. Anopheles albitarsis F (π = 0.013) represented the most recent cluster located closer to An. albitarsis I (π = 0.009). Barcode gap was detected according to Albitarsis Complex lineages previously reported (threshold 0.014-0.021). Anopheles albitarsis F has a wide distribution in northern South America and might play an important role in the transmission dynamics of malaria due to its high expansion capacity. Future studies are required to establish the southern distribution of An. albitarsis F in Venezuela, and its occurrence in Guyana and Ecuador."
https://openalex.org/W3169883359,"A premise of stream restoration theory and practice is that it is often futile to attempt to restore a stream at the reach scale (101-103 metres) until catchment scale problems have been addressed. This study considers reach scale restoration actions undertaken in Bryan Creek, a sand bed river in south east Australia impacted by a sediment pulse, after catchment sediment sources have been addressed. Local scale interventions, which were in-stream sand extraction, fencing to exclude stock and riparian revegetation, were evaluated by quantifying cross-section and thalweg variability, mapping in-stream and riparian vegetation and by classifying the morphology that emerged following each intervention. Following intervention channel reaches moved to one of three distinct states: simple clay bed, eroding reaches dominated by Juncus acutus, and reaches with deep pools and Phragmites australis. Boundaries between the intervention reaches were sharp, suggesting local scale interventions dominate over catchment scale processes. The magnitude and spread of variability metrics were similar between all reaches and differences in variability bore no relation to intervention type, despite the stark difference in post-intervention morphology. These findings suggest that cross-section and thalweg variability metrics are an inadequate proxy for the effectiveness of local scale interventions in accelerating the recovery of sand bed reaches from a bedload pulse. The most important implications for river managers is that local scale interventions can lead to substantial and rapid improvements in condition, and the change in condition of these reaches is almost independent of other reaches. In this case, the key to the pattern of reach scale geomorphic recovery is excluding stock from waterways so that a specific macrophyte can establish, trap sediment and develop pools."
https://openalex.org/W3170920872,"Crop tolerance to crowding stress, specifically plant population density, is an important target to improve productivity in processing sweet corn. Due to limited knowledge of biological mechanisms involved in crowding stress in sweet corn, a study was conducted to 1) investigate phenotypic and transcriptional response of sweet corn hybrids under different plant densties, 2) compare the crowding stress response mechanisms between hybrids and 3) identify candidate biological mechanisms involved in crowding stress response. Yield per hectare of a tolerant hybrid (DMC21-84) increased with plant density. Yield per hectare of a sensitive hybrid (GSS2259P) declined with plant density. Transcriptional analysis found 694, 537, 359 and 483 crowding stress differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for GSS2259P at the Fruit Farm and Vegetable Farm and for DMC21-84 at the Fruit Farm and Vegetable Farm, respectively. Strong transcriptional change due to hybrid was observed. Functional analyses of DEGs involved in crowding stress also revealed that protein folding and photosynthetic processes were common response mechanisms for both hybrids. However, DEGs related to starch biosynthetic, carbohydrate metabolism, and ABA related processes were significant only for DMC21-84, suggesting the genes have closer relationship to plant productivity under stress than other processes. These results collectively provide initial insight into potential crowding stress response mechanisms in sweet corn."
https://openalex.org/W3172837520,"Considering the background of traditional Chinese culture, which emphasizes that ""when we see outstanding people, we should think of emulating them"", and social comparison theory, this study explores how CEO awards impact the R&D investment of award-winning CEOs' competitors. The results show that award-winning CEOs' competitors increase R&D investment in the postaward period relative to the preaward period. We further find that CEO awards' ""gold content"", the social attention of award-winning CEOs' competitors, the similarity between award-winning CEOs and their competitors, and industry competitive pressure are important factors affecting the size of ripple effects. Empirical evidence also shows that the intraindustry ripple effects of CEO awards significantly improve the firm performance and value of competitors. In a robustness test, we confirm CEO awards' intraindustry ripple effects from the perspective of the number of patent applications. The ripple effects of CEO awards are still valid after using PSM-DID to alleviate endogeneity problems and considering the right-side distribution of R&D investment."
