After the second injection of antigen, the animals developed the flaccid paralysis and abnormal electromyographs characteristic of neuromuscular blockade. Treatment with the anticholinesterases edrophonium or neostigmine dramatically alleviated the paralysis and the fatigue seen in electromyography."

https://openalex.org/W2090013801,"The excessive accumulations of spongiosa in the long bones of congenitally osteopetrotic mice permanently disappeared after a brief parabiotic union to normal littermates. Most of the bone removal was accomplished long after interruption of parabiosis. It is proposed that, during parabiosis, progenitors of competent osteolytic cells were recruited from the blood of the normal mouse."

https://openalex.org/W1991992860,"2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, a toxic contaminant frequently formed during the synthesis of the herbicide 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid, was shown to be a potent inducer of hepatic delta-aminolevulinic acid synthetase in the chick embryo. As little as 4.66 x 10(-12) mole of the contaminant per egg produces a significant increase in the activity of the enzyme. Induction of the enzyme is related to the dose of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and, in contrast to that produced with other drugs, is prolonged in time, with 70 percent of the maximum induced activity present 5 days after a single dose. This contaminant is implicated as the likely causative agent in an outbreak of porphyria cutanea tarda in workers in a factory where 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid was being synthesized."

https://openalex.org/W1548892625,"Abstract Human intrinsic factor has been isolated from gastric juice. The protein was purified 853-fold with a yield of 85% utilizing affinity chromatography on vitamin B12-Sepharose as the sole purification technique. The final preparation was homogeneous based on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation. The isolated protein (20 µg) corrected vitamin B12 malabsorption when given to a patient with pernicious anemia in a standard Schilling test. Human intrinsic factor binds 30.1 µg of vitamin B12 per mg of protein and contains a single vitamin B12-binding site with an association constant for vitamin B12 of 1.5 x 1010 m-1. The molecular weight determined by sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation was 45,200 to 47,700 while that determined by amino acid and carbohydrate analyses was 44,200. The protein contains 15.0% carbohydrate which accounts for the elevated molecular weight values (59,000 to 66,000) obtained using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel filtration. In the presence of vitamin B12, human intrinsic factor aggregates to form dimers and higher molecular weight oligomers. When vitamin B12 binds to human intrinsic factor, the spectral maximum for vitamin B12 shifts from 361 nm to 362 nm and the absolute absorbance at 361 nm increases by 32%."

https://openalex.org/W1598353420,"Abstract The intermediates formed during the activation of prothrombin in 25% sodium citrate solutions have been isolated and partially characterized. Their properties are in agreement with those predicted by a previously proposed model for prothrombin activation in 25% sodium citrate: prothrombin (72,000 daltons) → intermediate 1 (65,000 daltons) → Intermediate 2 (39,000 daltons) and Intermediate 3 (25,000 daltons); Intermediate 2 (39,000 daltons) → thrombin (α-thrombin, 39,000 daltons) (Mann, K. G., Heldebrant, C. M., and Fass, D. N. (1971) J. Biol Chem. 246, 6106–6114). Intermediates 1 and 2, as predicted, can be activated to thrombin, while Intermediate 3 cannot. The chromatographic behavior of Intermediate 2 is nearly identical with that of thrombin. Molecular weight and amino acid composition data strongly suggest that α-thrombin is formed from Intermediate 2 by the loss of little, if any, of the Intermediate 2 sequence. Intermediates 2 and 3 are shown to be substantially independent portions of the prothrombin sequence. The tryptic peptides derived from Intermediates 2 and 3, while very dissimilar account for greater than 85% of the tryptic peptides derived from prothrombin. Furthermore, Intermediate 3 contains nearly twice as much half-cystine and more than twice as much neutral sugar as Intermediate 2. A product of prothrombin activation, apparently derived from Intermediate 3, has been shown to alter the activity of thrombin toward N-α-tosyl-l-arginine methyl ester and fibrinogen. The possibility that a thrombin of altered specificity may participate in the control and regulation of coagulation is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2077512342,"Visual resolution in humans is nearly equal for vertically and horizontally oriented detail, but for some subjects there is a substantial difference in resolving power for these orientations. Although subjects who exhibit this difference invariably have ocular astigmatism, optical explanations of the effect can be ruled out. Direct evidence has been found for an electrophysiological correlate to the psychophysical finding. Subjects who have reduced resolution for a pattern of a particular orientation also show a decreased evoked potential response elicited by a target of the same orientation. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that a deficiency of specific features in the early visual input can alter the organization of the visual pathways."

The enzyme in the detergent did not respond to hormone but after removal of the Lubrol PX with DEAE-cellulose, vasopressin responsiveness was partially restored. On gel filtration, 40% of the applied adenylate cyclase activity eluted as if it had a molecular weight of 100,000 to 200,000, another 30% had an apparent molecular weight of about 600,000, and the remainder was found in the void volume of Sepharose 4B."
https://openalex.org/W1996378120,"MORRELL1 has presented “evidence of a rigorous spatial specificity in the acoustical projection to visual neurones”. He observed that “along the horizontal meridian, the acoustical receptive fields were arranged in as orderly and systematic a way as the receptive fields for vision”. The acoustical receptive fields were mapped onto visual receptive fields “having the same horizontal boundaries as the corresponding visual receptive field(s)” (Fig. 4, ref. 1). The superposition of the visual and auditory receptive fields is difficult to understand if one takes into account that the eyes move within their orbits. What happens to this superposition if, for instance, the eyes are turned 10° to the left side whereas the head remains in its original position? Three different results are conceivable: (1) The visual receptive field is shifted 10° to the left and thus keeps its position with reference to retinal coordinates. The auditory receptive field remains at its original position. In this situation there would be a dissociation between the position of the visual and the auditory receptive fields. (2) Both the visual and the auditory receptive fields are shifted 10° to the left, that is, the visual system would “control” the position of the receptive fields of the auditory system. (3) Both the visual and the auditory receptive fields remain at their original position, that is, the position of the visual receptive fields is remapped in order to coincide with the position of the auditory receptive fields, and thus with head coordinates. The outcome of an experiment investigating these possibilities cannot be anticipated, and the results might differ between an anaesthetized and an unanaesthetized preparation. It seems, therefore, that the data do not yet establish clearly that there is a “rigorous spatial specificity in the acoustical projection to visual neurones”."

https://openalex.org/W1581163751,"Abstract Harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) and sperm whale (Physeter catodon) myoglobins were carboxymethylated in 0.2 m bromoacetate at pH 6.8. The modification of histidine residues leveled off after approximately 6 and 8 days, respectively, of reaction at 25° in the dark. The NH2-terminal glycine and valine residues, respectively, were modified, as were 1 or 2 lysine residues on the average. The modified seal protein was subjected to digestion with trypsin and the acid-insoluble fraction from that treatment further exposed to thermolysin. The modified sperm whale protein was subjected to thermolysin alone. Peptides containing histidine or a derivative were isolated and identified, and conclusions concerning the patterns of reactivity were tabulated. The results with the sperm whale protein confirm and complete the assignments reported previously (Hugli, T. E., and Gurd, F. R. N. (1970) J. Biol. Chem. 245, 1939–1946). Histidine residue 64 was found to be unreactive, while the peculiar suppression of reactivity of residue 36 relative to the reaction product obtained in the crystalline state was confirmed. The pattern of reactivity of the harbor seal protein was similar. The freely reactive histidine residues were 8, 81, 113, and 116, the unreactive residues were 24, 64, 82, 93, and 97, and those showing various patterns of restriction were 36, 48, 119, and 152."

https://openalex.org/W2058215594,"MOST investigations of the relationship between season of birth and mental illness have found that a disproportionate number of patients with schizophrenia or manic-depression were born in the early months of the year1,2. Most of these studies can reasonably be criticized on the grounds that the samples of patients were (a) not representative of all patients, and (b) not comparable with the general population used as the basis of expectation, because seasonal distribution of births in a general population may vary significantly not only from year to year but between adjacent geographical areas in the same year3. Dalen's study4 largely avoided these criticisms because his schizophrenic patients were representative of the whole of Sweden; he made a decade-by-decade comparison (P. Dalen, personal communication) of years of birth with the general population. He found a very significant excess of the patients had been born in the months January to March."

https://openalex.org/W2035573306,"CHANGES in the maternal metabolic and excretory functions occur during pregnancy; the plasma elimination rates of many compounds, such as folic acid1,2, cortisol3–5, nalidixic acid or gentamycin6, have been found to differ in non-pregnant and pregnant subjects. Also, the plasma steady state concentration of most of the free amino acids is already lowered early in pregnancy. Here I report on the elimination rate of the model α-amino-iso-butyric acid (AIB) in pregnant and non-pregnant rabbits. I chose this amino acid because it is not metabolized7,8; it is transported and distributed throughout the body by the same mechanism as the naturally occurring free amino acids preferring the A-mediating system9,10; it is slowly and almost exclusively excreted by the kidneys7,8,11; and it is believed to accumulate in fast growing foetal tissue12,13. Twenty-one experiments were performed using nine rabbits. Ten experiments were carried out in the non-pregnant and eleven in the pregnant animal. The pregnant rabbits were investigated in the first and third weeks of gestation."
