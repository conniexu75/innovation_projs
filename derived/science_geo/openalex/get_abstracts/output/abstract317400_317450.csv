https://openalex.org/W2086308288,"A pleomorphic bacterium was observed by electron microscopy in grape plants infected with Pierce's disease. The organism was located in xylem tissue, and its occurrence was closely associated with symptoms of Pierce's disease. The bacterium resembled a rickettsia in morphology, in its failure to grow on cell-free media, and in its sensitivity to tetracycline antibiotics."
https://openalex.org/W2025935547,Source parameters of stick-slip friction events measured in the laboratory show particle and rupture propagation velocities which are similar to those observed for earthquakes and inferred from seismic source theory. This dynamic similarity strongly supports the idea that stick-slip is the mechanism for shallow earthquakes.

After treatment of the sediments with Formalin there was no measurable chemical oxygen uptake, which shows that the total uptake is biological (community respiration)."
https://openalex.org/W2021553998,"Data from the Apollo 15 and Apollo 16 laser altimeters reveal the first accurate elevation differences between distant features on both sides of the moon. The large far-side depression observed in the Apollo 15 data is not present in the Apollo 16 data. When the laser results are compared with elevations on maps from the Aeronautical Chart and Information Center, differences of 2 kilometers over a few hundred kilometers are detected in the Mare Nubium and Mare Tranquillitatis regions. The Apollo 16 data alone would put a 2-kilometer bulge toward the earth; however, the combined data are best fit by a sphere of radius 1737.7 kilometers. The offset of the center of gravity from the optical center is about 2 kilometers toward the earth and 1 kilometer eastward. The polar direction parameters are not well determined."

https://openalex.org/W2039478323,"From measurements of the photochemical rate of production of CO(2)(16,18) and CO(2)(16,16), produced from the low intensity photolysis of mixtures of CO, H(2)O, Ar, and O(2)(18,18), the rate constant for the reaction HO(2) + CO --> CO(2) + OH has been determined at 300 degrees K to be less than or equal to 10(-20) cubic centimeter per molecule per second. These measurements indicate that the reaction of thermalized HO(2) is of negligible importance as a sink mechanism for converting CO to CO(2) in either the troposphere or the stratosphere."
https://openalex.org/W1633263995,"Our dates show that cattle and pigs were first domesticated in Europe. Sheep, which were thought to have become extinct in Europe during the terminal Pleistocene, also appear first in Europe. However, there remains little doubt that sheep were first domesticated in the Near East or Turkey, since no wild sheep appear to have existed in Europe at the beginning of the Holocene. Dogs were domesticated in both the Near East and Europe at virtually the same time. In the Near East, Asiab, at around 8000 B.C., qualifies as the first center of goat domestication. It is also the earliest center of domestication for all animals we have dated here. Horses were first domesticated in the steppes of the Ukraine, perhaps even earlier than our dates indicate, since all of the samples found at Polling are virtually contemporaneous (Fig. 1). Undoubtedly, future research will alter the details of our overall impressions, especially after bones at earlier sites such as Nea Nikomedeia have been dated directly. But, on balance, there can be no doubt that southeastern Europe was as much an early center of domestication as the Near East was."
https://openalex.org/W1981595296,"It has been shown that trophozoites of balantidia from the pig are normal in appearance and reactions when the medium is cooled to room temperature. They may live at room temperature for ten days. Trophozoites that infect the pig may pass through the stomach of the guinea-pig and reach the cecum, where they are normal after eighteen hours. Trophozoites are frequently passed in feces by the pig but cyst production is irregular and determined by unknown factors as in monkeys, guinea-pigs and man. The fluid of pig feces from the cecum is slightly hypertonic to blood serum. The method of Barret and Yarbrough for the cultivation of Balantidium coli has been found practicable for Balantidium from the pig and guinea-pig. The addition of rice starch improves the medium and Ringer's solution without dextrose was found more suitable than 0.5 per cent. NaCl solution. Loeffler's beef blood serum may be substituted for human serum or horse serum. H(2)S appears non-toxic to Balantidium from the pig when passed into culture tubes."

https://openalex.org/W2064397837,"An extract of Zygadenus gramineus, ""death camas,"" from which most of the resins had been removed was given intravenously to sheep prepared for recording blood-pressure and respiratory movements. Following the intravenous injection of this extract there occurred a respiratory inhibition which in the case of the injection of larger amounts of the extract was followed by asphyxia-like rises of blood-pressure. The graphic record of this asphyxial condition was practically duplicated by closing the tracheal cannula for a short time following the recovery of the animal from the effects of the plant extract. Although, from a field standpoint, no satisfactory antidote has been found, it has been demonstrated that caffein sodio-benzoate possesses marked powers of stimulation for the respiratory center affected by the depressive substances found in Zygadenus gramineus."
