https://openalex.org/W2017724386,"We recently reported the cloning of a rearranged human oncogene following transfection of DNA from Kaposi's sarcoma into NIH 3T3 cells. To identify the protein(s) encoded in two novel mRNAs of 3.5 and 1.2 kb expressed in NIH 3T3 transformants, we constructed a cDNA library. One of the cDNA clones isolated (KS3) corresponded to the 1.2 kb mRNA and transformed NIH 3T3 cell when inserted into a mammalian expression vector. The 1152 nucleotide KS3 cDNA encodes a protein of 206 amino acids with significant homology to the growth factors basic FGF and acidic FGF. Expression of the KS3 product as a bacterial fusion protein or in COS cells allowed us to determine that both proteins had significant growth-promoting activity and that the COS cell protein was glycosylated. Thus one of the mRNAs transcribed from the KS oncogene encodes a growth factor that could transform cells by an autocrine mechanism and appears to represent a new member of the FGF family."

https://openalex.org/W2003479600,"Adenovirus E1a proteins function in transcriptional activation, transcriptional repression, cellular DNA synthesis induction, and cellular transformation. Here we examine the role of the previously undefined E1a region 1, the last of three conserved E1a regions to be characterized. Region 1 is required for transcriptional repression, transformation, and DNA synthesis induction, but not transcriptional activation. These results support our previous suggestion that transcriptional repression is the basis of E1a-mediated transformation. Two conserved regions (regions 1 and 2), present in both early E1a proteins, are essential for transcriptional repression, transformation, and induction of DNA synthesis. In contrast, mutagenesis suggests that transcriptional activation requires only 49 amino acids (region 3) unique to the 289 amino acid E1a protein. This we prove by demonstrating that a 49 amino acid region 3 synthetic peptide efficiently activates an E1a-inducible promoter. This peptide is the smallest known protein fragment functioning as a transcriptional activator."
https://openalex.org/W1599809449,"The mechanism of cytotoxic action of 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (FdUrd) in mouse FM3A cells was investigated. We observed the FdUrd-induced imbalance of intracellular deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) pools and subsequent double strand breaks in mature DNA, accompanied by cell death. The imbalance of dNTP pools was maximal at 8 h after 1 microM FdUrd treatment; a depletion of dTTP and dGTP pools and an increase in the dATP pool were observed. The addition of FdUrd in culture medium induced strand breaks in DNA, giving rise to a 90 S peak by alkaline sucrose gradient sedimentation. The loss of cell viability and colony-forming ability occurred at about 10 h. DNA double strand breaks as measured by the neutral elution method were also observed in FdUrd-treated cells about 10 h after the addition. These results lead us to propose that DNA double strand breaks play an important role in the mechanism of FdUrd-mediated cell death. A comparison of the ratio of single and double strand breaks induced by FdUrd to that observed following radiation suggested that FdUrd produced double strand breaks exclusively. Cycloheximide inhibited both the production of DNA double strand breaks and the FdUrd-induced cell death. An activity that can induce DNA double strand breaks was detected in the lysate of FdUrd-treated FM3A cells but not in the untreated cells. This suggests that FdUrd induces the cellular DNA double strand breaking activity. The FdUrd-induced DNA strand breaks and cell death appear to occur in the S phase. Our results indicate that imbalance of the dNTP pools is a trigger for double strand DNA break and cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2089418619,"The T cell receptor alpha and beta chain genes donated by an H-2 class I-specific, CD8-dependent cytotoxic T cell clone were transferred, alone or in combination with the Lyt-2 gene, into a class II-restricted, CD4+ T cell hybridoma. Two important points emerged. First, the alpha and beta T cell receptor genes endowed the recipient with the H-2 class I specificity of the donor only if the same cell had also been transfected with the Lyt-2 gene. Second, the functional Lyt-2 molecule was expressed on the transfected cells in the absence of the Lyt-3 polypeptide. These results demonstrate that, besides the T cell receptor, the Lyt-2 polypeptide is the only subset-specific molecule required to retarget a class II-reactive, CD4+ T cell line toward H-2 class I molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2071829103,"Here we characterize FIS (factor for inversion stimulation), a new cellular component of the λ site-specific recombination pathway. This host protein binds to a specific region in the λ attP overlapping the Xis binding sites and can bind cooperatively with Xis to these sites. FIS stimulates λ excision up to 20-fold in vitro in the presence of suboptimal Xis concentrations, but has no effect in the presence of saturating Xis; FIS has no effect on integrative recombination. FIS can replace one Xis molecule in a series of cooperative and competitive interactions but cannot carry out excision in the absence of Xis. FIS's role in the regulation of recombination has been inferred from in vivo modification of DNA. In exponentially growing cells the λ FIS site is fully occupied, whereas in stationary-phase cells this binding site is vacant."
https://openalex.org/W2009075135,"The E19 protein of adenoviruses is a transmembrane protein that abrogates the intracellular transport of class I antigens by forming complexes with them in the ER. We show here that the E19 protein is retained in the ER even in the absence of class I antigens. To define the region conferring residency in the ER, we examined two mutant forms of the viral protein. A 5 amino acid extension of the 15-membered cytoplasmic tail of the protein reduces its interaction with class I antigens but does not change its intracellular distribution. Shortening the tail to 7 amino acids also diminishes the affinity for class I antigens; however, this mutant E19 protein becomes transported to the cell surface. Thus, we concluded that a small stretch of amino acids exposed on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane is responsible for the retention of the E19 protein in the ER."

https://openalex.org/W2035454865,"Allografts of pancreatic islets of Langerhans were induced to survive for an indefinite period in diabetic mice if, at the time of engraftment, the mice received a single course of treatment with a monoclonal antibody directed against the L3T4 determinant, a nonpolymorphic cell surface glycoprotein present on the cell surface of the murine T helper-inducer lymphocyte subset. This treatment allowed the survival of islets of Langerhans transplanted across a major histocompatibility barrier without additional immunosuppression. The results demonstrate that the lymphocyte subset defined by the expression of the L3T4 molecules is central to the induction of allograft rejection and provides a model for tolerance induction for organ allograft transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W1997559493,"Trisomy 21 usually results from nondisjunction during meiosis I. In order to determine whether nondisjunction results from failure of normal chromosome pairing or premature unpairing, recombination frequencies were estimated between DNA polymorphic markers on the long arm of chromosome 21 in families containing one individual with trisomy 21. The recombination frequencies on chromosomes 21 that had undergone nondisjunction were then compared to those on chromosomes 21 that had disjoined normally. The data indicate that recombination is reduced between DNA markers on nondisjoined chromosomes 21. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that reduced chiasma formation predisposes to nondisjunction, resulting in trisomy 21 in humans."

https://openalex.org/W1499947276,"The enzyme phosphoglucomutase can be used as a metal ion indicator to measure the concentrations of free Mg2+ and free Zn2+ in physiological fluids. In horse plasma, the concentration of free Mg2+ is close to 0.5 mM, whereas that of free Zn2+ is about 2 × 10(-10) M, although numerous physiological roles for Zn2+ have been postulated that would require free Zn2+ concentration orders of magnitude higher than this. A titration of plasma with Zn2+ shows that the fractional increase in free Zn2+ is essentially the same as the fractional increase in total exchangeable Zn2+, and the results are consistent with a model in which essentially all of the Zn2+ in plasma is bound to albumin. Regardless of the model, the buffering capacity of plasma for free Zn2+ is intrinsically low; however, its capacity relative to the total (exchangeable) Zn2+ present is maximal. The implications of this type of buffering for homeostasis of plasma Zn2+ are considered. Treatment of plasma with a strong reducing agent such as dithiothreitol (0.1 mM) substantially increases the apparent binding of Zn2+ and thus reduces the free Zn2+ concentration. However, the concentration of free Zn2+ appears to be insensitive to decreases in the physiological concentrations of reduced glutathione and cysteine. The concentrations of free Zn2+ and free Mg2+ in plasma are similar to those that have been reported for muscle tissue (rabbit). Their ratio is about 4 × 10(-7). The physiological implications of these concentrations are considered. In some cases, if the Zn2+ and Mg2+ complexes of an uncharacterized vertebrate protein exhibit significantly different properties, their relative importance under physiological conditions can be approximated by evaluating those of the mixed complexes present in a solution that contains the physiological concentration of free Mg2+, plus Zn2+ buffered with histidine, at the appropriate pH and ionic strength. Other metal ion/chelon systems that come close to reproducing the concentrations of free Mg2+ and free Zn2+ in horse plasma also are considered."
https://openalex.org/W1518124859,"We have expressed two variants of chicken striated muscle alpha-tropomyosin in Escherichia coli: fusion tropomyosin containing 80 amino acids of a non-structural influenza virus protein (NS1) on the amino terminus and a non-fusion tropomyosin which is a variant because the amino-terminal methionine is not acetylated (unacetylated tropomyosin). From our analysis of purified proteins in vitro we suggest that the amino-terminal region, which is highly conserved in muscle tropomyosins, is crucial for all aspects of tropomyosin function. Both forms are altered in tropomyosin activity: neither shows head-to-tail polymerization, with or without troponin. Unacetylated tropomyosin binds weakly to actin, but in the presence of troponin it binds well and can regulate the actomyosin ATPase. Fusion tropomyosin binds well to actin, but binding of troponin is calcium-sensitive and it does not confer effective calcium sensitivity on the actomyosin ATPase. Our results indicate that the local charge at the amino terminus is critical for actin binding but that normal head-to-tail association is not required. The properties of fusion tropomyosin-troponin interaction are indicative of impaired troponin T binding to tropomyosin and provide evidence for its binding to the amino terminus of tropomyosin."
https://openalex.org/W2005198041,"Local presentation of autoantigen by organ-resident cells inappropriately expressing Ia determinants has been implicated in organ-specific autoimmunity. Experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis, induced in rats by immunization with retinal soluble antigen, is used as a model of organ-specific autoimmunity. In an in vitro system derived from this model, uveitogenic rat T-helper lymphocytes specific to the retinal soluble antigen, or control T-helper lymphocytes reactive to the purified protein derivative of tuberculin, were cocultured with Ia-expressing syngeneic retinal glial cells (Müller cells) in the presence of specific antigen. Antigen presentation was not apparent under ordinary culture conditions, and the Müller cells profoundly suppressed the proliferative response of primed T-helper lymphocytes to antigen presented on conventional antigen-presenting cells, as well as their subsequent interleukin-2 (IL-2)-dependent expansion. Suppression of proliferation was accompanied by inhibition of IL-2 production in response to antigen, as well as by reduction in high-affinity IL-2 receptor expression, and proceeded via a contact-dependent mechanism. These results suggest a role for locally acting suppression mechanisms in immune regulation and maintenance of tissue homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1483436116,"Abstract Factor I is a serine proteinase of complement which together with one of several specific cofactors cleaves activation products of the third and fourth components of complement (C3b and C4b) and modulates the activity of C3 convertase. A heterodimer glycoprotein (Mr = 88,000), factor I is synthesized as a single-chain precursor, prepro-I, which undergoes intracellular proteolytic processing. The human hepatoma line HepG2, however, secretes predominantly the single-chain precursor pro-I. In order to determine the molecular basis for this apparent processing defect, factor I cDNA clones were isolated from a HepG2 mRNA-derived library. Sequencing of the largest insert, HI1971, revealed that it contains 14 base pairs of 5' untranslated region, the complete coding sequence for the 583-residue prepro-I (NH2-signal peptide-heavy chain-linking peptide-light chain-COOH), two polyadenylation signals within the 200-base pair 3' untranslated region, and a portion of poly(A) tail. Analysis of the derived protein structure 1) reveals a mosaic multidomain structure of the heavy chain; 2) demonstrates structural similarity between intracellular conversion of pro-I and activation of other serine proteinase zymogens; and 3) indicates that the light chain of factor I resembles most closely the active subunit of tissue plasminogen activator among all serine proteinases and factor D among complement proteinases. Furthermore, this protein sequence was compared to the sequences of factor I cDNA clones isolated from normal human liver libraries and found to be identical. By exclusion, this defines as cellular the basis for the inefficient processing of pro-I by the HepG2 line. Chromosomal localization by the somatic cell hybrid method maps the factor I gene to chromosome 4."

https://openalex.org/W1560446212,"A proteoglycan was isolated from the human placenta by procedures including affinity chromatography with fibronectin immobilized on agarose. The glycosaminoglycan chains were found to be composed of heparan sulfate (86%) and dermatan sulfate (14%). The average molecular weights were estimated to be 1.8 − 10(5) for heparan sulfate and 1.2 − 10(5) for dermatan sulfate. Mouse monoclonal antibodies HS42 and HS47 were prepared against the proteoglycan, and examination of the specificity of these antibodies indicated that they recognized the core protein portion. The binding specificity, as studied by the solid phase enzyme-linked immunoassay with monoclonal antibody HS47, indicated that the proteoglycan bound to solid phase fibronectin and to laminin, but not to collagen types I, II, and IV or gelatin. Competitive immunoassays suggested that the proteoglycan bound weakly to the liquid phase-soluble fibronectin. These studies also indicated that the core protein was involved in the interaction between the proteoglycan and solid phase fibronectin. The ubiquitous distribution of this proteoglycan in the human tissues was demonstrated by the immunohistochemical method and thus suggested its important role in the tissue organization and function."
https://openalex.org/W1537376484,"A hybrid human cDNA was constructed by splicing of a cDNA fragment of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), encoding 5'-untranslated, the pre-pro region and amino acids Ser1-Thr263, with a cDNA fragment of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA), encoding amino acids Leu144-Leu411. The cDNA fragments were obtained from full length t-PA cDNA, cloned from Bowes melanoma poly(A)+ mRNA, and from full length u-PA cDNA, cloned from CALU-3 lung adenocarcinoma poly(A)+ mRNA. The hybrid (t-PA/u-PA) cDNA was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and the translation product purified from the conditioned cell culture media. On SDS-gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions, the protein migrated as a single band with approximate Mr 70,000. On immunoblotting, it reacted both with rabbit antisera raised against human t-PA and against human u-PA. The urokinase-like amidolytic activity of the protein was only 320 IU/mg but increased to 43,000 IU/mg after treatment with plasmin, which resulted in conversion of the single-chain molecule (t-PA/scu-PA) to a two-chain molecule (t-PA/tcu-PA). The specific activity of the protein on fibrin plates was 57,000 IU/mg by comparison with the International Reference Preparation for Urokinase. Both the single-chain hybrid (t-PA/scu-PA) and the two-chain plasmin derivative (t-PA/tcu-PA) bound specifically to fibrin, albeit more weakly than t-PA. The t-PA/tcu-PA hybrid had a higher selectivity for fibrin than tcu-PA, measured in a system composed of a whole human 125I-fibrin-labeled plasma clot immersed in human plasma. Both hybrid proteins activated plasminogen directly with Km = 1.5 microM and k2 = 0.0058 s-1 for t-PA/scu-PA and with Km = 80 microM and k2 = 5.6 s-1 for t-PA/tcu-PA. CNBr-digested fibrinogen stimulated the activation of plasminogen with t-PA/tcu-PA (Km = 0.20 microM and k2 = 1.2 s-1). It is concluded that these t-PA/u-PA hybrid proteins combine, at least to some extent, the fibrin-affinity of t-PA with the enzymatic properties of u-PA (either scu-PA or tcu-PA), which in some assays result in improved fibrin-mediated plasminogen activation."
https://openalex.org/W1982200052,"The human T cell receptor (TCR) gamma polypeptide occurs in structurally distinct forms on certain peripheral blood T lymphocytes. Complementary DNA clones representing the transcripts of functionally rearranged TCR gamma genes in these cells have been analyzed. The expression of a disulfide-linked and a nondisulfide-linked form of TCR gamma correlates with the use of the C gamma 1 and C gamma 2 constant-region gene segments, respectively. Variability in TCR gamma polypeptide size and disulfide linkage is determined by the number of copies and the sequence of a repeated segment of the constant region. Thus C gamma 1 and C gamma 2 are used to generate structurally distinct, yet functional, T3-associated receptor complexes on peripheral blood lymphocytes. Tryptic peptide mapping suggests that the T3-associated TCR gamma and delta peptides in the nondisulfide-linked form are distinct."
https://openalex.org/W1965144569,"We have developed an in vitro splicing system using a HeLa cell nuclear extract that is highly active for the alternative splicing of the natural E1A transcripts. The efficiency of using the three alternative 5' splice sites is strongly dependent on the ionic conditions in the reaction, and the simultaneous production of the 13S, 12S, and 9S mRNA species is observed only at appropriate salt concentrations. All the intermediate and final splicing products have been extensively characterized and it has been demonstrated that the same major branch site is used for all the alternative reactions. The ratio of 13S to 9S mRNAs formed is close to that observed in vivo early in infection, suggesting that most of the mechanisms giving rise to alternative splicing are preserved in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1495009998,"A keratan sulfate proteoglycan was isolated under denaturing conditions from the mineral compartment of rabbit cortical bone. This small proteoglycan (Kd = 0.39 on Superose 6, Mr approximately 20,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels) contained small keratan sulfate chains that were distinctly bimodal in size. The keratanase and endo-beta-galactosidase digestible glycosaminoglycan chains were O-linked to a core protein of Mr approximately 80,000. This core protein had several properties in common with the bone sialoprotein II molecule of bovine and human bone including: a closely spaced doublet band on sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis gels; a high staining intensity with Stains All that was greatly diminished by neuraminidase; a significant amount of small O-linked oligosaccharides; and an amino-terminal amino acid sequence that was nearly identical to human bone sialoprotein II. (In contrast, bone sialoprotein II in human, bovine, and rat bone does not appear to have any keratan sulfate chains.) Antiserum made against the keratan sulfate proteoglycan reacted with its core protein on electrotransfers from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels."
https://openalex.org/W1521897480,"The receptor for human interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) was purified from foreskin fibroblasts. Triton X-100 extracts obtained from either intact cells or membrane preparations were passed through an immobilized interferon-gamma column. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of eluted fractions revealed a major band of Mr = 95,000 and minor bands of Mr = 80,000 and 60,000. Further purification was obtained by steric exclusion and by lectin chromatography. The purified receptor retained the ability to bind 125I-IFN-gamma with a Kd of 2.2 X 10(-10) M, a value close to that obtained with intact fibroblasts (5 X 10(-10) M). A complex of Mr = 105,000-125,000 was visualized by immunoprecipitation of 125I-IFN-gamma cross-linked to the purified receptor followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. A similar complex was obtained when 125I-IFN-gamma was cross-linked to intact cells. Immunization of mice with the excised SDS-PAGE band of Mr = 95,000 elicited antibodies that blocked the antiviral activity of IFN-gamma and immunoprecipitated the cross-linked complex of 125I-IFN-gamma and its receptor."

https://openalex.org/W1513298671,"Abstract The Ca2+-transporting ATPase (EC 3.6.1.38) of sarcoplasmic reticulum alternates between several conformational states during ATP-dependent Ca2+ transport. The E1 conformation is stabilized by 0.1 mM Ca2+ and the E2 conformation by vanadate in a Ca2+-free medium. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy reveals significant differences between the two states that indicate differences in the protein secondary structure. The two states and the corresponding spectra can be interconverted reversibly by changing the Ca2+ concentration of the medium. The infrared spectral changes indicate the appearance of a new alpha-helical substructure connected with the E1----E2 conversion accompanied by small changes in beta-turns, while the beta-sheet content remains essentially unchanged. There are also differences between the E1 and E2 states in the C = O stretching vibrations of the ester carbonyl groups of phospholipids in intact sarcoplasmic reticulum that are not observed under identical conditions in isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum lipid dispersions. These observations imply an effect of proteins on the structure of the interfacial regions of the phospholipids that is dependent on the conformational state of the Ca2+-ATPase. The CH2- and CH3-stretching frequencies of the membrane lipids are not affected significantly by the E1----E2 transition. The Fourier transform infrared spectra of sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles in the presence of 20 mM Ca2+ suggest the stabilization of a protein conformation similar to the E2 state except for differences in the behavior of COO- and phospholipid ester C = O groups that may reflect charge effects of the bound Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1599180710,"Abstract Phosphorylation of cellular proteins is known to play an important role in mediating the metabolic effects of insulin in target cells. Here we show that exposure of intact adipocytes to physiological concentrations of insulin results in phosphorylation of the calcium receptor protein, calmodulin. The identity of the phosphorylated protein as being calmodulin in intact cells was demonstrated by two-dimensional electrophoresis, N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalene sulfonamide (W7)-affinity chromatography, and positive staining with the Ca2+ binding protein stain Stains All. Phosphorylation of calmodulin occurred at physiological insulin concentrations with maximum stimulation (608 +/- 114% over basal) at 50 microunits/ml (3.3 X 10(-10) M) insulin. The 32Pi incorporated into calmodulin was stable to base, indicating that phosphotyrosine was involved and thus implicating the insulin-receptor tyrosine kinase as being responsible for its phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of calmodulin may represent an important component of the mechanism for intracellular signaling not only for insulin, but potentially for other physiological regulators of cellular metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1532525052,"The mechanism of regulation of actin-subfragment 1 nucleoside triphosphatase is described in terms of the rate and equilibrium constants of a relatively simple kinetic scheme: (Formula: see text) where T, D, and Pi are nucleoside triphosphate, nucleoside diphosphate, and inorganic phosphate, respectively; Ka, Kb, and Kc are association constants; the ki are first-order rate constants; A is regulated actin (actin-tropomyosin-troponin); and M is subfragment 1. Calcium binding to regulated actin had little effect on step 2; k2 was almost unaffected, and k-2 increased, at most, 2-fold. k-1 and k3 increased 10-20-fold for ATP and 3-5-fold for 1-N6-ethenoadenosine triphosphate as substrates. Kb and Kc increased by less than 50%, whereas Ka increased 6-10-fold. The primary effect in regulation is on the rate of a conformational change which determines the rate of dissociation of ligands bound to the active site. The measurements probably underestimate the ratio of rate constants of product dissociation for active and relaxed states of actin because of heterogeneity. The kinetic evidence can be explained by a partial steric blocking mechanism or by a conformational (nonsteric) mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2057767241,The involvement of the E. coli methyl-directed and very short patch (vsp) mismatch repair systems in bacteriophage λ recombination has been studied. Genetic crosses and heteroduplex transfection experiments were performed using λ phages with sequenced mutations in the cl gene. The results indicate that methyl-directed repair does operate during bacteriophage λ recombination but generally does not contribute to the formation of recombinants involving close markers. Vsp repair apparently acts during bacteriophage λ recombination to produce recombinants involving close markers because its action does not involve extensive excision tracts. Marker-specific hyperrecombination and the apparent clustering of genetic exchanges in bacteriophage λ recombination can be accounted for by the action of the vsp repair system.
https://openalex.org/W1479879348,"The inactivation of Factor Va by plasmin was studied in the presence and absence of phospholipid vesicles and calcium ions. The cleavage patterns of bovine Factor Va and its isolated subunits were analyzed using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the progress of inactivation was monitored by clotting assays and measurements of prothrombin activation using 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonylarginine-N-(3-ethyl-1,5-penta nediyl)amide. In addition, the ability of prothrombin and Factor Xa to protect Factor Va from inactivation by human plasmin was examined. The data presented indicate that the cofactor Factor Va is inactivated rapidly upon its interaction with human plasmin. The rate of inactivation is significantly enhanced in the presence of phospholipid vesicles, suggesting that the inactivation process is a membrane-bound phenomenon. The isolated D component (heavy chain of factor Va) was found to be slowly degraded by human plasmin, giving rise to cleavage products different from those obtained with activated protein C and Factor Xa. However, the 48- and 30-kDa fragments obtained from human plasmin degradation of component E (light chain of Factor Va) appear to be similar to those obtained following the proteolysis of the same subunit by activated protein C and Factor Xa."
https://openalex.org/W1600946779,"We have used Ca2+-dependent binding to a phospholipid vesicle affinity column to isolate a mixture of three synexin-like proteins from the cytosol of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), with relative molecular weights of approximately 67,000, 47,000, and 28,000. Rabbit antibodies raised against bovine liver synexin recognized the 47,000 molecular weight PMN protein. These PMN proteins, like bovine liver synexin, promoted aggregation of isolated PMN specific granules in the presence of Ca2+ and increased the overall rate of Ca2+-induced fusion of liposomes composed of phosphatidate (PA)/phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (1:3) and phosphatidylserine/PE (1:3), but decreased the rate of spermine-induced fusion of PA/PE (1:3) liposomes. Using fluorescent lipid probes, rapid fusion of PA/PE liposomes with PMN specific granules (50% maximum signal within a few minutes) was observed when 1 mM Ca2+ was added in the presence of both synexin and free arachidonic acid. Dilution of the aqueous contents of liposomes was also observed under the same conditions. The rate of fusion increased monotonically with Ca2+ and arachidonic acid concentrations, but synexin exhibited an optimum concentration. Lack of any one of the components precluded rapid fusion. These results suggest that PMN contain a protein similar to, or identical with, synexin that may be involved in calcium-dependent fusion of intracellular membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1520826813,"The pyrF gene of Escherichia coli K12, which encodes the pyrimidine biosynthetic enzyme orotidine-5'-monophosphate (OMP) decarboxylase, is part of an operon that includes a downstream gene designated orfF. The orfF gene product is a small polypeptide of unknown function. The nucleotide sequence of a 1549-base pair chromosomal fragment containing this operon was determined. An open reading frame capable of encoding the 27-kDa OMP decarboxylase subunit was identified and shown to be the pyrF structural gene by purifying and characterizing OMP decarboxylase. The subunit molecular weight (Mr = 26,350), amino-terminal amino acid sequence, and amino acid composition of the polypeptide predicted from the nucleotide sequence are in excellent agreement with those properties determined for the purified enzyme. The orfF structural gene was tentatively identified and apparently encodes an 11,396-dalton polypeptide. The orfF translational initiation codon overlaps the pyrF termination codon, which may indicate translational coupling in the expression of these genes. The pyrF promoter was mapped by primer extension of in vivo transcripts. The primary transcriptional initiation site is 51 base pairs upstream of the pyrF structural gene. The level of pyrF transcription and OMP decarboxylase synthesis was found to be coordinately derepressed by pyrimidine limitation, indicating that regulation of pyrF gene expression occurs at the transcriptional level. Inspection of the nucleotide sequence indicates that pyrF gene expression is not regulated by an attenuation control mechanism similar to that described for the pyrBI operon or pyrE gene. Finally, we compared the amino acid sequences of the OMP decarboxylases from E. coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Neurospora crassa, and Ehrlich ascites cells to identify conserved regions."
https://openalex.org/W2117114738,"Irradiation of demembranated flagella of sea urchin sperm at 365 nm in the presence of 0.05-1 mM MgATP and 5-10 microM vanadate (Vi) cleaves the alpha and beta heavy chains of the outer arm dynein at the same site and at about the same rate as reported previously for the solubilized dynein (Gibbons, I. R., Lee-Eiford, A., Mocz, G., Phillipson, C. A., Tang, W.-J. Y., and Gibbons, B. H. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 2780-2786). The decrease in intact alpha and beta heavy chain material is biphasic, with about 80% being lost with a half-time of 8-10 min, and the remainder more slowly. Five other axonemal polypeptides of Mr greater than 350,000 are lost similarly, concomitant with the appearance of at least 9 new peptides of Mr 150,000-250,000. The motility of irradiated sperm flagella upon subsequent dilution into reactivation medium containing 1 mM ATP and 2.5 mM catechol shows a progressive decrease in flagellar beat frequency for irradiation times that produce up to about 50% cleavage of the dynein heavy chains; more prolonged irradiation causes irreversible loss of motility. Competition between photocleaved and intact outer arm dynein for rebinding to dynein-depleted sperm flagella shows that cleavage has little effect upon the ability for rebinding, although the cleaved dynein partially inhibits subsequent motility. Substitution of MnATP for the MgATP in the irradiation medium prevents the loss of all of the axonemal polypeptides during irradiation for up to 60 min and also protects the potential for subsequent flagellar motility. It is concluded that loss of the five axonemal polypeptides upon irradiation results from a Vi-sensitized photocleavage similar to that which occurs in the alpha and beta heavy chains of outer arm dynein and that these polypeptides represent Vi-inhibitable ATPase subunits of dyneins located in the inner arms and possibly elsewhere in the flagellar axoneme."
https://openalex.org/W1527371412,"Abstract We have previously reported that the GDP-bound alpha-subunit of the GTP-binding protein transducin, present in outer segments of retinal rod cells (ROS), serves as a high affinity in vitro substrate (Km = 1 microM) for the insulin receptor kinase. The present study demonstrates that transducin also serves as in vitro substrate for an endogenous IGF-I receptor kinase isolated from ROS membranes. The presence of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) receptors in ROS is evident from the high affinity and specific binding of 125I-IGF-I to ROS membranes (Kd = 3 nM) which contain 110 fmol of IGF-I binding sites/mg of membrane protein. Furthermore, cross-linking of 125I-IGF-I labels the 135-kDa alpha-subunit of this receptor. 125I-Insulin binding capacity to ROS membranes is less than 5% that of IGF-I. The IGF-I-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity in solubilized and partially purified receptors from ROS autophosphorylates its own 95-kDa beta-subunits as well as other substrates like transducin. Insulin, which is 200-fold less potent than IGF-I in competing for 125I-IGF-I binding, is only 5-fold less potent than IGF-I in stimulating the receptor kinase activity. This suggests that insulin is much more potent than IGF-I in coupling ligand binding with kinase activation. The previously reported presence of IGF-I in the vitreous, together with our present studies, strongly suggest that the IGF-I receptor kinase, through phosphorylation of endogenous proteins like transducin, could play a role in mediating transmembrane signal transduction in ROS."
https://openalex.org/W1528724366,"Abstract The V1 vasopressin receptor has been solubilized from rat liver membranes with the zwitterionic detergent 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammoniol]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS) and reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles. There is essentially complete solubilization of the receptor by 3% CHAPS at a protein concentration of 15 mg/ml. Reconstitution into soybean phospholipid vesicles is readily achieved either by gel filtration chromatography or by membrane dialysis. The binding of [3H]vasopressin to proteoliposomes is specific, saturable, reversible, and magnesium-dependent. In contrast, the detergent-soluble vasopressin receptor does not display specific binding. The apparent affinity of the reconstituted receptor for [3H]vasopressin is approximately 4-fold lower than that of the receptor in native membranes. In addition, the binding of [3H]vasopressin to reconstituted vesicles is not sensitive to 100 microM guanosine 5'-O-thiotriphosphate (GTP gamma S) as it is in native membranes. However, the apparent affinity of the reconstituted receptor for ligand approximates that of native membranes when membranes are prebound with vasopressin prior to solubilization and reconstitution into vesicles. Furthermore, vesicles reconstituted from membranes prebound with vasopressin show GTP gamma S sensitivity of [3H] vasopressin binding. This finding strongly suggests that vasopressin stabilizes a receptor-G-protein complex during solubilization. The rat liver vasopressin receptor is a glycoprotein, as shown by its specific binding to the lectin germ agglutinin. The vasopressin receptor can be reconstituted from the N-acetylglucosamine-eluted peak of a wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose column, and [3H] vasopressin binding activity is purified 5-6-fold from membranes by this chromatographic procedure. The functionality of the partially purified receptor is indicated by its ability to bind ligand with high affinity and by its ability to functionally interact with a G-protein when vasopressin is bound prior to solubilization."
https://openalex.org/W1587132603,"The ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme intermediate (E1P) of sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase was formed using CaATP as a substrate and release of its bound calcium was investigated. Our previous study (Shigekawa, M., Wakabayashi, S., and Nakamura, H. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 14157-14161) indicated that 1 mol of E1P has 3 mol of high affinity binding sites for Ca2+, of which two are transport sites for Ca2+, whereas the remainder is presumably the nucleotide binding site. The calcium bound to the substrate site was readily replaced by other divalent cations or lanthanide ions. These ions induced a pronounced change in the rate of Ca2+ release from the transport sites on the same phosphoenzyme. In E1P, whose substrate site had been deprived of a metal, Ca2+ release from the transport sites was fast. It was similar to the Ca2+ release from the normal E1P, whose substrate site was occupied by either Ca2+ or Mg2+, in that it was accelerated by increasing pH or high ATP and inhibited markedly by the treatment of the enzyme with phospholipase C. Release of Ca2+ from E1P, whose substrate site had been rendered metal-free, increased the fluorescence intensity of the enzyme-bound 2'(3')-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)adenosine 5'-triphosphate, which decayed rapidly upon addition of Mg2+ plus K+. This result suggests that the active site of the resultant divalent cation-free phosphoenzyme has a conformation similar to that for the normal ADP-insensitive phosphoenzyme, E2P. These data suggest that the basic mechanism for Ca2+ release from the phosphoenzyme may be similar whether or not the phosphoenzyme has bound metal at its substrate site, although this metal affects the rate of Ca2+ release extensively."
https://openalex.org/W2050292419,"The primary product of the adenovirus E1A gene is a protein that is sufficient for controlling host-cell proliferation and immortalizing primary rodent cells. The mechanism by which the protein induces these cellular effects is poorly understood, but might be linked to its ability to regulate RNA transcription from a number of viral and cellular genes. The mechanism of E1A's transcriptional-activation (trans-activation) was studied here by monitoring the protein's effect on specific adenovirus promoters in two types of transcriptional systems in vitro. One of these systems consisted of extracts from transformed cells constitutively expressing E1A, and the other consisted of extracts of HeLa cells supplemented with a plasmid-encoded E1A protein purified from Escherichia coli. The results show that the E1A protein specifically stimulates transcription from adenovirus promoters; thus, the induction of cellular transcription factors is not necessary to explain the stimulation of transcription by E1A."
https://openalex.org/W1657811283,"Since phosphonoformic acid (PFA) acts as a specific competitive inhibitor of Na+-Pi co-transport across renal brush-border membrane (BBM), we employed the [14C]PFA as a probe to determine the mechanism of its interaction with rat renal BBM. The binding of [14C]PFA to BBM vesicles (BBMV), with Na+ present in extravesicular medium (Na+o), was time- and temperature-dependent. The replacement of Na+o with other monovalent cations reduced the PFA binding by -80%. Cl- was the most effective accompanying monovalent anion as NaCl for maximum PFA binding. The Na+o increased the apparent affinity of BBMV for [14C]PFA binding, but it did not change the maximum binding capacity. The maximum [14C]PFA binding was achieved at Na+o approximately equal to 50 mM. The extent of Na+-dependent [14C]PFA binding correlated (r = 0.98; p less than 0.01) with percent inhibition by an equimolar dose of PFA of the (Na+o greater than Na+i)-dependent BBMV uptake of 32Pi. Intravesicular Na+ (Na+i) decreased [14C]PFA binding, on BBMV, and this inhibition by Na+i was dependent on the presence of Na+o. The increase in Na+i, at constant [Na+]o, decreased the Vmax, but not the Km, for [14C]PFA binding on BBMV. Bound [14C]PFA was displaced from BBMV by phosphonocarboxylic acids proportionally (r = 0.99; p less than 0.05) to their ability to inhibit (Na+o greater than Na+i)-gradient-dependent Pi transport, whereas other monophosphonates, diphosphonates, L-proline, or D-glucose did not influence the [14C]PFA binding. The Na+-dependent binding of [14C]PFA and of [3H]phlorizin by BBMV was 10 times higher than binding of these ligands to renal basolateral membranes and to mitochondria. [14C]PFA probably binds onto the same locus on the luminal surface of BBM, where Pi and Na+ form a ternary complex with the Na+-Pi co-transporter."
https://openalex.org/W1505301300,"Human C4b-binding protein (C4BP) is a regulator of the classical pathway of the complement system. It appears in two forms in plasma, as free protein and in a noncovalent complex with the vitamin K-dependent coagulation protein, protein S. In the electron microscope C4BP has a spider-like structure with a central core and seven extended tentacles, each of which has a binding site for C4b, although the protein S-binding site has not been unequivocally pinpointed. C4BP was subjected to chymotrypsin digestion which yielded two major fragments, one of 160 kDa representing the central core, and one of 48 kDa representing the cleaved-off tentacles. We have now localized the protein S-binding site to the 160-kDa central core fragment. Using immunoblotting with a panel of polyclonal antisera, the isolated central core was shown to be completely devoid of 48-kDa fragments. The protein S-binding site was susceptible to proteolysis by chymotrypsin, but was protected by a molar excess of protein S included during the proteolysis. The 160-kDa central core fragment consisted of identical, disulfide-linked 25-kDa peptides and a proper disulfide bond arrangement was crucial to protein S binding. Using a direct binding assay it was shown that the isolated central core had the same affinity for protein S as intact C4BP."
https://openalex.org/W1495363389,"Ornithine decarboxylase, a highly regulated enzyme of the polyamine pathway, was purified 670-fold from mycelia of Neurospora crassa that were highly augmented for enzyme activity. The enzyme is significantly different from those reported from three other lower eucaryotic organisms: Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Physarum polycephalum, and Tetrahymena pyriformis. Instead, the enzyme closely resembles the enzymes from mammals. The Mr = 110,000 enzyme is a dimer of 53,000 Da subunits, with a specific activity of 2,610 mumol per h per mg of protein. Antisera were raised to the purified enzyme and were rendered highly specific by cross-absorption with extracts of a mutant strain lacking ornithine decarboxylase protein. With the antisera, we show that the inactivation of the enzyme in response to polyamines is proportional to the loss of ornithine decarboxylase protein over almost 2 orders of magnitude. This is similar to the inactivation process in certain mammalian tissues, and different from the process in S. cerevisiae and P. polycephalum, in which enzyme modification, without proportional loss of antigen, accompanies enzyme inactivation. The N. crassa enzyme is therefore suitable as a microbial model for studies of the molecular regulation of the mammalian enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1585158105,"Platelet plasma and intracellular membrane fractions were isolated from a mixed membrane fraction after sucrose cushion centrifugation. Their previous identification through biochemical and immunological characterization is now confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis of the membrane proteins which reveals a different protein profile. The two associated calcium transport systems showed a different time course and exhibited different oxalate sensitivity. The plasma membranes are not permeable to potassium oxalate but the Ca2+ uptake was stimulated by potassium oxalate in intracellular membranes. We then focused on the study of the plasma membrane-associated Ca2+-activated ATPase which shows the following characteristics: a linearity in the time course until 30 min, an apparent affinity toward calcium of about 10(-7) M without detectable inhibition at higher concentrations, a maximal activity at pH 8, a high ATP requirement because the maximal response was obtained with 200 microM, and a high specificity toward ATP as energy donor. Taken together, these studies indicate the possible involvement of both a plasma membrane and a dense tubular system Ca2+-ATPase in the regulation of Ca2+ concentration in human platelets."
https://openalex.org/W1518317706,"We have examined some of the early pre-priming steps of bacteriophage lambda dv DNA replication in vitro. Previous experiments have shown that bacteriophage lambda replication requires host RNA polymerase-dependent RNA synthesis near or at the origin of replication (ori lambda) to initiate DNA synthesis. Using a crude Fraction II enzymatic system we have shown that during RNA polymerase action, at least the bacteriophage lambda O and lambda P replication proteins as well as the host dnaB protein must be present to initiate ori lambda-specific DNA replication. The presence of three other host initiation proteins, dnaG primase, dnaJ, and dnaK, is not required during RNA polymerase action. Because of the apparent absence of a requirement for the dnaJ and dnaK pre-priming proteins during the transcriptional activation step, we propose that the early events of lambda dv DNA replication, prior to action by the dnaG primase, can be divided into two recognizable steps: an early step which requires at least RNA polymerase, lambda O, lambda P, and dnaB, and a subsequent step which requires the action of at least the dnaJ and dnaK proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1558302213,"During ATP hydrolysis by Ca2+-activated chemically skinned fibers from the flight muscle of the giant waterbug Lethocerus indicus, there is extensive phosphate-water oxygen exchange. For unstrained fibers the pattern of exchange shows that there is more than one pathway for hydrolysis, due to the ATPase activity of cross-bridges. Multiple pathways are an established property of both vertebrate actomyosin and fibers. The pattern of exchange can be fitted by two pathways: one with low exchange because the step(s) controlling Pi release are rapid, the other with high exchange and slow Pi release. The high-exchange pathway is responsible for most of the increase in ATPase activity on Ca2+ activation. On strain activation, only the high-exchange pathway is present, accounting for all the ATPase increase and responsible for force generation. In fully activated fibers, the cross-bridges which hydrolyze ATP and generate force behave uniformly with respect to oxygen exchange. The exchange pattern shows that the rate of Pi release changes dramatically over a very narrow strain increase. Step(s) controlling Pi release are at least partially rate-limiting for the overall ATPase reaction. The results are discussed in relation to models for strain activation and the identity of force-generating states."
https://openalex.org/W1561871810,"We have investigated the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate proteoglycan in human colon carcinoma cells cultured in either the absence of L-glutamine or the presence of 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON), a glutamine analogue. Following a 24-h incubation with 100 micrograms/ml DON (0.58 mM) or without L-glutamine, the incorporation of [35S]sulfate was maximally inhibited to about 50%, whereas the incorporation of [3H]leucine or [3H]serine and their specific activity were not significantly affected. Several lines of evidence indicate that the inhibition of [35S]sulfate incorporation was mediated by a reduction in the intracellular pool of UDP-N-acetylhexosamine: the intracellular hexosamine levels were reduced by about 50%; taking into account the changes in specific activity, the incorporation of [3H]glucosamine was also significantly inhibited; and exogenous D-glucosamine (2.3 mM) was capable of substantially reversing the inhibitory effects of DON. This decrease in endogenous sugar supply resulted in the generation of an underglycosylated, lower buoyant density proteoglycan which contained significantly fewer heparan sulfate chains of otherwise normal size and sulfation and even fewer O-linked oligosaccharides. These biochemical changes were corroborated ultrastructurally by the appearance of smaller ruthenium red-stained proteoglycans on the surface of the cells. DON also caused a marked inhibition of cell proliferation and profound morphological changes, both of which were reversible upon culturing in DON-free medium. These results demonstrate that perturbations in glutamine metabolism have profound effects on the structure of heparan sulfate proteoglycan and on the phenotype of human colon carcinoma cells and indicate that DON treatment could be useful for studying post-translational modifications of proteoglycans in various cell systems."
https://openalex.org/W1532128609,"Proatrial natriuretic factor (proANF) is phosphorylated in primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiocytes. Rittenhouse et al. (Rittenhouse, J., Moberly, L., O'Donnell, M. E., Owen, N. E., and Marcus, F. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 7607-7610) observed that cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylated synthetic peptides related to atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and that phosphorylated ANF peptides were more effective in stimulating Na/K/Cl cotransport in smooth muscle cells than nonphosphorylated forms. In our studies, rat cardiocytes in culture were incubated with [32P]orthophosphoric acid, and ANF-related peptides in cell extracts and culture media were isolated using antisera to ANF. Both atrial and ventricular cardiocytes contained and secreted phosphorylated proANF, a 126-amino acid precursor of ANF. Phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated isoforms of proANF were resolved by isoelectric focusing; approximately 35% of the proANF secreted by cardiocytes was phosphorylated. proANF is phosphorylated on a serine residue localized to a 42-amino acid tryptic fragment (proANF residues 26-67). We conclude that proANF is phosphorylated by rat cardiocytes but not within the portion of the molecule destined to become ANF (proANF residues 99-126). Phosphorylation may have a role in the cellular mechanisms of proANF storage and secretion or in the modulation of potential biological activities of the circulating amino-terminal portion of proANF."
https://openalex.org/W1572302305,"Abstract Human liver microsomal fractions exhibit ATP-supported Ca2+ uptake which is half-maximal at 7 X 10(-7) M free Ca2+ in the presence of oxalate. Ca2+ uptake is coupled to a Ca2+-stimulated ATPase activity, which is half-maximal at 4 X 10(-7) M free Ca2+. Catalysis involves formation of an Mr = 116,000 phosphoprotein with stability characteristics of an acylphosphate compound suggested to represent a phosphoryl protein intermediate of the Ca2+-ATPase. Phosphorylation is half-maximal at about 10(-6) M free Ca2+. The Mr = 116,000 protein is highly susceptible to proteolysis with trypsin. The phosphorylated active site was localized in an Mr = 58,000 primary tryptic fragment and in an Mr = 34,000 subfragment. Analyses on the mechanism of the Ca2+-ATPase suggest the following reaction sequence: formation of an ADP-reactive phosphoenzyme (Mr = 116,000) with bound Ca2+, which can transphosphorylate its Pi to ADP, giving rise to synthesis of ATP; reversible transformation of the ADP-reactive phosphoenzyme into an isomer without bound Ca2+, which cannot further react with ADP; hydrolytical cleavage, probably catalyzed by Mg2+, of the ADP-unreactive phosphoenzyme with liberation of Pi. Comparison with the Ca2+-transport ATPase in sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle led us to suggest that the Mr = 116,000 Ca2+-ATPase belongs to the class of E1P . E2P-ATPases and might be operative as a Ca2+-transport ATPase at the level of the endoplasmic reticulum in human liver."
https://openalex.org/W2001202975,"Tritiated vasopressin ([3H]AVP) was directly crosslinked to its human platelet receptor by using an ultraviolet irradiation procedure. After preincubation with [3H]AVP, the hydrodynamic parameters of the hormone-receptor complexes solubilized with 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane sulfonate were derived from Sephacryl S-300 superfine gel filtration and from sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation experiments. The following values were obtained: Stoke's radius = 5.48 +/- 0.1 nm, apparent sedimentation coefficient = 5.55 +/- 0.1 S, and calculated molecular weight = 132,000. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-8% polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions, [3H]AVP preferentially and specifically labeled a 125,000-dalton protein. The labeling of this protein was suppressed by addition of excess cold vasopressin, whereas angiotensin II did not inhibit incorporation of tritiated vasopressin in this protein. These results suggest that direct UV-photoaffinity labelling with [3H]AVP is a suitable tool for the purification of the human platelet vasopressin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1540882200,"Abstract The actin-dependent ATPase activity of myosin is retained in the separated heads (S1) which contain the NH2-terminal 95-kDa heavy chain fragment and one or two light chains. The S1 heavy chain can be degraded further by limited trypsin treatment into characteristic 25-, 50-, and 20-kDa peptides, in this order from the NH2-terminal end. The 20-kDa peptide contains an actin-binding site and SH1 and SH2, two thiols whose modification dramatically affects ATPase activity. By treating myosin filaments with trypsin at 4 degrees C in the presence of 2 mM MgCl2, we have now obtained preferential cleavage at the 50-20-kDa heavy chain site without any cleavage at the head-rod junction and hinge region in the rod. Incubation of these trypsinized filaments at 37 degrees C in the presence of MgATP released a new S1 fraction which lacked the COOH-terminal 20-kDa heavy chain peptide region. This fraction, termed S1'(75K), has more than 50% of the actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity of S1 and the characteristic Ca2+-ATPase and K+-EDTA ATPase activities of myosin. These results show that SH1 and SH2 are not essential for ATPase activity and that binding of actin to the 20-kDa region is not essential for the enhancement of the Mg2+-ATPase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1564546917,"Effects of H+ and Mg2+ on the hydrolysis rate of the ADP-insensitive phosphoenzyme intermediate (E2P) of the sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase were investigated at 6 degrees C in the presence and absence of K+. In the absence of K+, the pH dependence of the E2P hydrolysis rate obtained in the absence of divalent cations showed a bell-shaped profile with an optimum at pH 9. At neutral pH, Mg2+ or other divalent cations accelerated the E2P hydrolysis while they strongly inhibited it at alkaline pH. The accelerating effect occurred on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane whereas the inhibitory effect occurred on the luminal side of the membrane, presumably at the low affinity calcium transport sites. The presence of Mg2+ or other divalent cations, therefore, shifted the pH activity profile to the acidic side while the magnitude of this shift and the activity obtained at the optimum pH depended on the species and the concentration of the divalent cation used. Simulation of a set of the pH activity curves obtained in 0 to 40 mM Mg2+ suggests that the marked activation of E2P hydrolysis by high Mg2+ observed at neutral pH is primarily caused by a Mg2+-induced increase in the dissociation constant of the ionizing group(s) rather than a markedly increased rate constant for E2P hydrolysis. In the presence of K+, the stimulatory effect of Mg2+ at pH 7 was less pronounced but its inhibitory effect at pH 9 was similar to that observed in the absence of K+. These effects of Mg2+ and other divalent cations should be taken into account when the role of H+ in the ATPase reaction is investigated."
https://openalex.org/W1580044345,"Abstract Sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles were noncovalently labeled at micromolar concentrations with the polycationic fluorescent reagent 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), and changes in the fluorescence intensity of the membrane-bound dye associated with functions of the Ca2+ pump and Ca2+ release were investigated. It was found that 1) DAPI fluorescence changed in the [Ca2+] range in which high affinity Ca2+ binding to the Ca2+-ATPase takes place. The time course of the Ca2+-induced changes of DAPI fluorescence was essentially the mirror image of that of tryptophan fluorescence. 2) The fluorescence intensity of bound DAPI decreased upon increase of the intravesicular [Ca2+] by either ATP-dependent Ca2+ accumulation or incubation with millimolar Ca2+ in the presence of a calcium ionophore. 3) Upon induction of Ca2+ release by adding caffeine after the completion of Ca2+ uptake, DAPI fluorescence showed transient changes. Two classes of binding sites of the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane for DAPI were clearly distinguishable: a high affinity site (Ka = 3.0 X 10(5) M-1) with a capacity of about 1 mol/mol of Ca2+-ATPase (8.0 nmol/mg of protein) and low affinity sites with about 20-fold lower affinity and 10-fold larger capacity. The partially purified Ca2+-ATPase showed similar characteristics of high affinity DAPI binding, suggesting that DAPI bound to its high affinity site on the Ca2+-ATPase monitors the enzyme conformational changes coupled with the events described above. The high affinity binding of DAPI to the enzyme led to an increase of the initial rate of Ca2+ uptake and the inhibition of Ca2+ release induced by caffeine or ionic replacement. These results suggest that the Ca2+-ATPase is involved in some steps of the Ca2+ release mechanism."
