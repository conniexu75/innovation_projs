https://openalex.org/W2889190248,"Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that is caused by the interplay of genetic, particularly the HLA-DR15 haplotype, and environmental risk factors. How these etiologic factors contribute to generating an autoreactive CD4+ T cell repertoire is not clear. Here, we demonstrate that self-reactivity, defined as ""autoproliferation"" of peripheral Th1 cells, is elevated in patients carrying the HLA-DR15 haplotype. Autoproliferation is mediated by memory B cells in a HLA-DR-dependent manner. Depletion of B cells in vitro and therapeutically in vivo by anti-CD20 effectively reduces T cell autoproliferation. T cell receptor deep sequencing showed that in vitro autoproliferating T cells are enriched for brain-homing T cells. Using an unbiased epitope discovery approach, we identified RASGRP2 as target autoantigen that is expressed in the brain and B cells. These findings will be instrumental to address important questions regarding pathogenic B-T cell interactions in multiple sclerosis and possibly also to develop novel therapies."

Here, we reveal that the direct effects of light on learning and mood utilize distinct ipRGC output streams. ipRGCs that project to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) mediate the effects of light on learning, independently of the SCN’s pacemaker function. Mood regulation by light, on the other hand, requires an SCN-independent pathway linking ipRGCs to a previously unrecognized thalamic region, termed perihabenular nucleus (PHb). The PHb is integrated in a distinctive circuitry with mood-regulating centers and is both necessary and sufficient for driving the effects of light on affective behavior.

The constancy of the solar cycle as a signal for the regulation of mammalian behavior is manifested, among other things, in the powerful effects that light exerts on mood and cognition. These effects have been documented in laboratory animals (Bedrosian et al., 2011Bedrosian T.A. Fonken L.K. Walton J.C. Haim A. Nelson R.J.

Depressive symptoms and cognitive dysfunction linked to light can be brought on by natural conditions or by people’s own agency by traveling across time zones and experiencing jet lag or in shift-work (Jaeger et al., 2006Jaeger J.

The magnitude of these mood effects is large as ∼20% of the general population is affected (Melrose, 2015Melrose S.

In mammals, light detection occurs exclusively in the retina (Hattar et al., 2003Hattar S. Lucas R.J. Mrosovsky N. Thompson S. Douglas R.H. Hankins M.W. Lem J. Biel M. Hofmann F. Foster R.G. Yau K.W.

Parallel processing in the mammalian retina.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). In addition to classical rod and cone photoreceptors, a subpopulation of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that express the photopigment melanopsin (Opn4), making them intrinsically photosensitive (ip)RGCs, constitute the third type of photoreceptors (Berson et al., 2002Berson D.M.

At present, 5 subtypes (M1–M5) of ipRGCs have been described (Ecker et al., 2010Ecker J.L. Dumitrescu O.N. Wong K.Y. Alam N.M. Chen S.-K. LeGates T. Renna J.M. Prusky G.T. Berson D.M. Hattar S.

Their central projections differ amply, reflecting in this variety the multiform nature of the non-image-forming visual functions they participate in such as circadian photoentrainment and sleep regulation (Altimus et al., 2008Altimus C.M. Güler A.D. Villa K.L. McNeill D.S. Legates T.A. Hattar S. Rods-cones and melanopsin detect light and dark to modulate sleep independent of image formation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Central projections of melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells in the mouse.J. Comp. Neurol. 2006; 497: 326-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). A major ipRGC target is the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which houses a central pacemaker that orchestrates peripheral clocks to drive circadian rhythmic coherence (Morin, 2013Morin L.P. Neuroanatomy of the extended circadian rhythm system.Exp. Neurol. 2013; 243: 4-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Genetic ablation of ipRGCs completely abrogates light reception at the SCN level, suggesting that ipRGCs constitute the only conduit for light input to modulate circadian brain functions (Güler et al., 2008Güler A.D. Ecker J.L. Lall G.S. Haq S. Altimus C.M. Liao H.-W. Barnard A.R. Cahill H. Badea T.C. Zhao H. et al.Melanopsin cells are the principal conduits for rod-cone input to non-image-forming vision.Nature. 2008; 453: 102-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Notably, the regulation of mood and learning by light is also absent in mice where ipRGCs are ablated (LeGates et al., 2012LeGates T.A. Altimus C.M. Wang H. Lee H.-K. Yang S. Zhao H. Kirkwood A. Weber E.T. Hattar S. Aberrant light directly impairs mood and learning through melanopsin-expressing neurons.Nature. 2012; 491: 594-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, LeGates et al., 2014LeGates T.A. Fernandez D.C. Hattar S. Light as a central modulator of circadian rhythms, sleep and affect.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2014; 15: 443-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar), indicating that ipRGCs are the main sensory channel driving these behavioral effects. The ipRGC central targets mediating these effects, however, remain unknown. Here, we show that a subset of ipRGCs, that are defined by the lack of Brn3b expression and project to the SCN, are sufficient to drive light-mediated cognitive deficits without disrupting the SCN clockwork machinery. An SCN-independent pathway mediates light-induced mood changes through ipRGC input to the perihabenular nucleus (PHb) of the dorsal thalamus. PHb neurons project to well-characterized mood-regulating centers. Furthermore, the PHb is both necessary and sufficient for driving the effects of light on affective behavior. These findings reveal two distinct retinal-brain pathways that mediate the direct effects of light on mood and cognition. The use of an ultradian light cycle (T7 cycle; alternating 3.5-hr periods of light and darkness) allowed us to determine the direct effects of light on mood and learning (LeGates et al., 2012LeGates T.A. Altimus C.M. Wang H. Lee H.-K. Yang S. Zhao H. Kirkwood A. Weber E.T. Hattar S. Aberrant light directly impairs mood and learning through melanopsin-expressing neurons.Nature. 2012; 491: 594-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). To investigate whether light input to the SCN is sufficient to drive the behavioral alterations induced by the T7 cycle, we used a previously described mouse line, Opn4Cre/+;Brn3bzDTA/+ (Chen et al., 2011Chen S.-K. Badea T.C. Hattar S. Photoentrainment and pupillary light reflex are mediated by distinct populations of ipRGCs.Nature. 2011; 476: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), in which Brn3b(−) ipRGCs that innervate the SCN survive, whereas Brn3b(+) ipRGCs projecting outside the SCN are substantially ablated (Figures 1A–1C and S1A–S1C). Opn4Cre/+;Brn3bzDTA/+ mice photoentrained under a normal light/dark cycle (T24 cycle), and their circadian periods were lengthened when exposed to the T7 cycle, similar to Opn4Cre/+ (control) mice (Figures 1D and 1E). Thus, the general circadian responses are intact in these animals.Figure S1T7 Cycle-Housed Opn4Cre;Brn3bzDTA Mice Showed Hippocampal Learning and Functional Deficits, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A-C) CTβ was intravitreally injected in Opn4Cre/+ and Opn4Cre/+;Brn3bzDTA/+ mice in order to trace retinal fibers.

A dense retinal innervation was observed throughout the SCN in both groups of mice (A), whereas a drastic reduction in retinal innervation in the PHb was observed in Opn4Cre/+;Brn3bzDTA/+ mice.

Under the T24 cycle, Opn4Cre/+ and Opn4Cre/+;Brn3bzDTA/+ mice showed similar learning and cognitive functions (Figures 1F–1H; novel object recognition [NOR] test: p = 0.57; Morris water maze [MWM], test trial: p = 0.5, by Tukey’s test), indicating that the ablation of Brn3b(+) ipRGCs did not affect the cognitive functions of these animals. When exposed to the T7 cycle for 2 weeks, Opn4Cre/+;Brn3bzDTA/+ animals displayed cognitive deficits, similar to those observed in T7 cycle-housed control (Opn4Cre/+) mice (Figures 1F–1H). Specifically, T7 cycle-housed mice spent significantly less time exploring the novel object than mice housed under the T24 cycle (Figures 1F and S1D). In the MWM, T7 cycle-housed mice exhibited significant deficits during training, test, and reverse phases, relative to mice housed under the T24 cycle (Figures 1G, 1H, S1E, and S1F). For both behavioral tests, no significant differences were found in the results obtained from Opn4Cre/+ and Opn4Cre/+;Brn3bzDTA/+ mice exposed to the T7 cycle (Figures 1F–1H; NOR: p = 0.45; MWM, test trial: p = 0.86; by Tukey’s test). In line with the behavioral studies, hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) was significantly attenuated in both Opn4Cre/+ (control) and Opn4Cre/+;Brn3bzDTA/+ mice when housed under the T7 cycle, relative to T24-housed groups (Figures 1I and S1G). The LTP alterations were specific to activity-dependent potentiation by the theta-burst stimulus, because other aspects of transmission were normal (Figures S1H and S1I). Together, these results highlight the sufficiency of the Brn3b(−) ipRGCs in mediating light-induced LTP and cognitive deficits. We previously found that the rhythmic expression of the clock gene period2 (PER2) in the SCN was unperturbed by the T7 cycle (LeGates et al., 2012LeGates T.A. Altimus C.M. Wang H. Lee H.-K. Yang S. Zhao H. Kirkwood A. Weber E.T. Hattar S. Aberrant light directly impairs mood and learning through melanopsin-expressing neurons.Nature. 2012; 491: 594-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). This raises a conundrum: if the SCN remains responsive to light under the T7 cycle, why are PER2 levels unaffected under a recurring light activation? To address this question, we first tested whether the photic responsiveness of SCN neurons is affected under the T7 cycle, by evaluating the phosphorylation of CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein), one of the first steps in gene induction in response to light (Chawla, 2002Chawla S. Regulation of gene expression by Ca2+ signals in neuronal cells.Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 447: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Light-induced pCREB levels were similar in the SCN from animals maintained under T24 and T7 cycles (Figures 2A–2D), indicating that the SCN is still responsive to light in T7 cycle-housed mice. Interestingly, it was recently shown that the SCN can act not only as a circadian pacemaker, but also as a relay for light input to peripheral oscillators (Izumo et al., 2014Izumo M. Pejchal M. Schook A.C. Lange R.P. Walisser J.A. Sato T.R. Wang X. Bradfield C.A. Takahashi J.S. Differential effects of light and feeding on circadian organization of peripheral clocks in a forebrain Bmal1 mutant.eLife. 2014; 3https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04617Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To explore the role of the SCN as a light relay versus a circadian pacemaker, we analyzed the effects of T7 cycle on Period1 (PER1), a clock gene that shows both a robust rhythmic expression and a fast response to light (Travnickova-Bendova et al., 2002Travnickova-Bendova Z. Cermakian N. Reppert S.M. Sassone-Corsi P. Bimodal regulation of mPeriod promoters by CREB-dependent signaling and CLOCK/BMAL1 activity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 7728-7733Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). We found that under T7 cycle, the expression levels of PER1 were rhythmic in the SCN (Figures 2E and 2F), whereas the acute effects of light on PER1 induction were abrogated (Figures 2G and 2H). Combined, the effects of light on pCREB levels and PER1 induction indicate that the photic responsiveness of the SCN is distinctively altered by the T7 cycle. To further investigate the overall changes in SCN photic responsiveness, we performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) on isolated SCN samples (Figure 2A). We found that 29 genes were differentially regulated between T24 and T7 cycle groups (false discovery rate [FDR]-adjusted p < 0.01, Figure S2A) including a striking depletion of classical immediate-early genes in T7 cycle-housed animals (Figures 2I and 2J). Gene ontology analysis of differentially regulated transcripts revealed a depletion of genes involved in transcription as well as Ca2+ and cAMP responses, further suggesting that the T7 cycle dramatically alters the photic responsiveness of the SCN (Figure S2B). In support of the RNA-seq data, we found a significant decrease in light-mediated c-Fos induction in SCN neurons under the T7 cycle, compared with T24-housed mice (Figures S3A and S3B). c-Fos induction in the SCN requires the phosphorylation of both CREB and ELK-1, leading to the recruitment of CREB-binding protein, resulting in gene transcription through the acetylation and phosphorylation of histones, including histone-3 (H3) (Chawla, 2002Chawla S. Regulation of gene expression by Ca2+ signals in neuronal cells.Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 447: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, Kako and Ishida, 1998Kako K. Ishida N. The role of transcription factors in circadian gene expression.Neurosci. Res. 1998; 31: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In contrast to pCREB, the light-induced pELK-1 and pH3 levels were significantly reduced in SCN neurons from animals housed under the T7 cycle (Figures S3A, S3C, and S3D). Combined, these data show that the SCN becomes refractory to light-induced transcriptional changes that would otherwise impinge on the clockwork machinery under the T7 cycle.Figure S3Light Responsiveness in the SCN and PHb, Related to Figures 2 and 4Show full caption(A) T24 and T7 cycle-housed WT mice were kept in darkness for 1 day, and received a light pulse (15 min) at CT14.

To investigate whether Brn3b(−) SCN-projecting ipRGCs also affect mood-related behaviors, mice were housed under the T24 or T7 cycles, and the sucrose preference test (SPT), tail suspension test (TST), and forced-swim test (FST) were performed. Under normal light conditions, Opn4Cre/+ (control) and Opn4Cre/+;Brn3bzDTA/+ mice showed no significant differences in their behavioral responses (Figure 3; SPT, p = 0.600; TST, p = 0.921; FST, p = 0.859; by Tukey’s test). Remarkably, ablating ipRGC projections outside the SCN abolished mood alterations induced by the T7 cycle. Specifically, Opn4Cre/+;Brn3bzDTA/+ mice exposed to the T7 cycle showed no significant differences in the sucrose preference index (Figure 3A), immobility time during the TST (Figure 3B) and FST (Figure 3C), compared to mice housed under the T24 cycle. In addition, under the T7 cycle, results obtained from Opn4Cre/+;Brn3bzDTA/+ mice were significantly different compared with Opn4Cre/+ mice (Figure 3; SPT, p < 0.001; TST, p < 0.05; FST, p < 0.001; by Tukey’s test). Thus, ipRGC pathways, distinct from the SCN, must be responsible for driving light regulation of mood. Among the ipRGC targets that might mediate the perturbation of affective behavior by unnatural light cycles, a region of the dorsal thalamus, adjacent to the epithalamic lateral habenula (LHb), is of particular interest. This region, which was previously termed perihabenular region (PHb), has been shown to receive retinal innervation (Hattar et al., 2006Hattar S. Kumar M. Park A. Tong P. Tung J. Yau K.-W. Berson D.M.

Wild-type (WT) mice showed a robust light-mediated c-Fos induction throughout the PHb (Figures 4A and 4C ), whereas mice lacking ipRGC innervation to the PHb (Opn4Cre/+;Brn3bzDTA/+) showed no induction of c-Fos (Figure S3E). We found that T7-housed WT mice showed a normal c-Fos induction in the PHb after a light pulse exposure (Figures 4B and 4C), suggesting that, contrary to the SCN, the PHb photoresponsiveness is unaltered under T7 cycle. PHb neurons show a robust rhythmic expression of the clock gene PER2 under normal light conditions (Figure 4D). The c-Fos induction observed in PHb neurons raises the possibility that under the T7 cycle, neurons may be abnormally (and chronically) activated by the appearance of light every 3.5 hr, which would lead to alterations in PER2 rhythmic expression. Indeed, when WT mice were housed under the T7 cycle, PER2 rhythmicity was abolished in the PHb, maintaining high PER2 levels throughout (Figure 4D). These results suggest that light input has a direct impact over clock genes expression, as revealed by alterations in PER2, known to show a slow response to light (Travnickova-Bendova et al., 2002Travnickova-Bendova Z.

To further evaluate whether ipRGCs are involved in this process, we tested mice in which ipRGCs are ablated by the expression of the attenuated diphtheria toxin (Opn4aDTA/aDTA). We previously found a drastic reduction of ipRGC innervation in these animals at 6 months of age (Ecker et al., 2010Ecker J.L. Dumitrescu O.N. Wong K.Y. Alam N.M. Chen S.-K. LeGates T. Renna J.M.

Specifically, only sparse retinal fibers were observed in the most caudal PHb region in Opn4aDTA/aDTA mice (Figures S4A and S4B). Importantly, in the absence of the ipRGC projections, PER2 rhythmicity in the PHb was maintained in Opn4aDTA/aDTA mice housed under the T7 cycle (Figures 4E, S4C, and S4D).

However, the developmental landscapes of human spermatogenesis remain unknown. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis for 2,854 testicular cells from donors with normal spermatogenesis and 174 testicular cells from one nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA) donor. A hierarchical model was established, which was characterized by the sequential and stepwise development of three spermatogonia subtypes, seven spermatocyte subtypes, and four spermatid subtypes. Further analysis identified several stage-specific marker genes of human germ cells, such as HMGA1, PIWIL4, TEX29, SCML1, and CCDC112. Moreover, we identified altered gene expression patterns in the testicular somatic cells of one NOA patient via scRNA-seq analysis, paving the way for further diagnosis of male infertility. Our work allows for the reconstruction of transcriptional programs inherent to sequential cell fate transition during human spermatogenesis and has implications for deciphering male-related reproductive disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2888695486,"Midbrain dopamine neurons are well known for their role in reward-based reinforcement learning. We found that the activity of dopamine axons in the posterior tail of the striatum (TS) scaled with the novelty and intensity of external stimuli, but did not encode reward value. We demonstrated that the ablation of TS-projecting dopamine neurons specifically inhibited avoidance of novel or high-intensity stimuli without affecting animals' initial avoidance responses, suggesting a role in reinforcement rather than simply in avoidance itself. Furthermore, we found that animals avoided optogenetic activation of dopamine axons in TS during a choice task and that this stimulation could partially reinstate avoidance of a familiar object. These results suggest that TS-projecting dopamine neurons reinforce avoidance of threatening stimuli. More generally, our results indicate that there are at least two axes of reinforcement learning using dopamine in the striatum: one based on value and one based on external threat."
https://openalex.org/W2889033116,"Astrocytes tile the central nervous system, but their functions in neural microcircuits in vivo and their roles in mammalian behavior remain incompletely defined. We used two-photon laser scanning microscopy, electrophysiology, MINIscopes, RNA-seq, and a genetic approach to explore the effects of reduced striatal astrocyte Ca2+ signaling in vivo. In wild-type mice, reducing striatal astrocyte Ca2+-dependent signaling increased repetitive self-grooming behaviors by altering medium spiny neuron (MSN) activity. The mechanism involved astrocyte-mediated neuromodulation facilitated by ambient GABA and was corrected by blocking astrocyte GABA transporter 3 (GAT-3). Furthermore, in a mouse model of Huntington's disease, dysregulation of GABA and astrocyte Ca2+ signaling accompanied excessive self-grooming, which was relieved by blocking GAT-3. Assessments with RNA-seq revealed astrocyte genes and pathways regulated by Ca2+ signaling in a cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous manner, including Rab11a, a regulator of GAT-3 functional expression. Thus, striatal astrocytes contribute to neuromodulation controlling mouse obsessive-compulsive-like behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2889365936,"Cysteine sulfinic acid or S-sulfinylation is an oxidative post-translational modification (OxiPTM) that is known to be involved in redox-dependent regulation of protein function but has been historically difficult to analyze biochemically. To facilitate the detection of S-sulfinylated proteins, we demonstrate that a clickable, electrophilic diazene probe (DiaAlk) enables capture and site-centric proteomic analysis of this OxiPTM. Using this workflow, we revealed a striking difference between sulfenic acid modification (S-sulfenylation) and the S-sulfinylation dynamic response to oxidative stress, which is indicative of different roles for these OxiPTMs in redox regulation. We also identified >55 heretofore-unknown protein substrates of the cysteine sulfinic acid reductase sulfiredoxin, extending its function well beyond those of 2-cysteine peroxiredoxins (2-Cys PRDX1-4) and offering new insights into the role of this unique oxidoreductase as a central mediator of reactive oxygen species-associated diseases, particularly cancer. DiaAlk therefore provides a novel tool to profile S-sulfinylated proteins and study their regulatory mechanisms in cells."

An increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing STR instability would facilitate efforts to develop treatments for repeat expansion disorders. Healthy individuals have tens of thousands of relatively short STR tracts distributed throughout their genomes (Gymrek and Erlich, 2013Gymrek M. Erlich Y.

Normal-length STR tracts are generally stable across generations and among somatic tissues in the same individual (McMurray, 2010McMurray C.T. Mechanisms of trinucleotide repeat instability during human development.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 786-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). By a process that is poorly understood, a small number of specific normal-length STRs undergo somatic or germline expansion and transition to intermediate, pre-mutation, and mutation (affected) repeat unit tract lengths (Mirkin, 2007Mirkin S.M. Expandable DNA repeats and human disease.Nature. 2007; 447: 932-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, Pearson et al., 2005Pearson C.E. Nichol Edamura K. Cleary J.D. Repeat instability: mechanisms of dynamic mutations.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 729-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). A fundamental unresolved question is why STRs at some key genomic locations are susceptible to unstable expansion leading to severe pathology, whereas most normal-length STRs across the genome remain relatively stable. Disease-associated STR tracts (hereafter referred to as daSTRs) exhibit tremendous diversity in sequence, gene body location, and tract length. daSTRs consist predominantly of a trinucleotide unit, but expandable tetra-, penta-, and hexa-nucleotide repeat sequences have also been reported (Iyer et al., 2015Iyer R.R. Pluciennik A. Napierala M. Wells R.D. DNA triplet repeat expansion and mismatch repair.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2015; 84: 199-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Pre-mutation and mutation lengths vary widely among the repeat expansion disorders (Iyer et al., 2015Iyer R.R. Pluciennik A. Napierala M. Wells R.D.

Mechanisms of trinucleotide repeat instability during human development.Nat. Rev.

Taylor J.P. Repeat expansion disease: progress and puzzles in disease pathogenesis.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The diversity of daSTR features renders them challenging to study and raises the question of whether a unified model could exist to explain the mechanisms governing repeat instability. Mammalian genomes are organized into a hierarchy of megabase (Mb)-scale topologically associating domains (TADs) (Dixon et al., 2012Dixon J.R. Selvaraj S. Yue F. Kim A. Li Y. Shen Y. Hu M. Liu J.S.

Here, we discover a link between 3D genome folding and repeat expansion disorders. Although daSTRs exhibit tremendous diversity in sequence, gene body location, and mutation-length threshold, we find that nearly all are spatially co-localized to boundaries between chromatin domains. Boundaries can be stratified into at least two groups: (1) those with high CpG island density and high occupancy of the architectural protein CCCTC binding factor (CTCF), and (2) those depleted of CpG island density. We demonstrate that nearly all daSTRs are specifically targeted to CpG island-rich boundaries, but not boundaries devoid of CpG islands or CpG islands internal to domains. Notably, we observe severe boundary disruption in B cells, fibroblasts, and postmortem brain tissue derived from patients with fragile X syndrome. The extent of boundary disruption correlates with the degree of FMR1 silencing and loss of CTCF occupancy at specific sites adjacent to the FMR1 daSTR. Together, these data support a working model in which the unique genetic, epigenetic, and topological state at a critical subset of 3D chromatin domain boundaries might earmark locations in the genome with increased susceptibility to STR instability in human disease. To understand higher-order 3D genome folding patterns around daSTR loci, we analyzed Hi-C maps generated from human ESCs (Dixon et al., 2015Dixon J.R. Jung I. Selvaraj S. Shen Y. Antosiewicz-Bourget J.E. Lee A.Y. Ye Z. Kim A. Rajagopal N.

Lu D. et al.Chromosome conformation elucidates regulatory relationships in developing human brain.Nature. 2016; 538: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Because the samples are not diseased, we mapped daSTRs to the normal-length repeat tracts found in the hg19 reference genome (Tables S1, S2, and S3). To quantitatively determine the precise location of Mb-scale TAD boundaries, we used a well-established method based on the directionality index (DI) test statistic and a hidden Markov model (DI+HMM) (Dixon et al., 2012Dixon J.R. Selvaraj S. Yue F. Kim A. Li Y. Shen Y. Hu M. Liu J.S. Ren B.

Xie W. et al.Chromatin architecture reorganization during stem cell differentiation.Nature. 2015; 518: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous reports (STAR Methods), we identified 2,384 TADs in human ESCs using a DI window of 50 (Dixon et al., 2012Dixon J.R. Selvaraj S. Yue F. Kim A. Li Y. Shen Y. Hu M. Liu J.S.

Surprisingly, we observed that 11 out of 27 daSTR loci exhibit striking co-localization with boundaries of TADs, including FMR1 (fragile X syndrome), HTT (Huntington’s disease), DMPK (Myotonic dystrophy 1), FXN (Friedreich’s ataxia), C9orf72 (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), and ATXN1 (spinocerebellar ataxia 1) (Figures 1A and S1A).Figure S1The Majority of Disease-Associated STRs Are Positioned at Domain Boundaries in Human ESCs, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A–D) Heatmaps of 40-kilobase binned Hi-C data in human embryonic stem cells for daSTR loci co-localized with (A) TAD boundaries called using the DI-HMM method, (B) subTAD boundaries called using 3DNetMod, (C) qualitative boundaries, or (D) not at boundary.

Genes (green) containing the daSTR (red) are shown in the tracks below heatmaps. Domain boundaries at the daSTR are demarcated with a black arrow. We next set out to understand the daSTRs initially classified as distal from TAD boundaries. We used a new method recently developed by our lab, 3DNetMod (Norton et al., 2018Norton H.K. Emerson D.J. Huang H. Kim J. Titus K.R. Gu S. Bassett D.S. Phillips-Cremins J.E. Detecting hierarchical genome folding with network modularity.Nat. Methods. 2018; 15: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), to identify a nested hierarchy of 15,330 subTADs in human ESCs (detailed in the STAR Methods). We detected an additional 11 out of 27 daSTRs at subTAD boundaries, including RUNX2 (cleidocranial dysplasia), ZIC2 (holoprosencephaly), and CACNA1A (spinocerebellar ataxia 6) (Figures 1B and S1B). Notably, 4 of the 5 daSTR loci that did not exhibit adjacency to quantitatively called domain boundaries were still co-localized at visually evident domain borders (Figures S1C and S1D). We can attribute the false-negative boundaries missed by 3DNetMod to our decision to use rigorous thresholds that minimize false-positive domain detection. Thus, our observation of 22 out of 27 daSTR loci at human ESC boundaries is a conservative estimate. Together, our analyses indicate that the majority of daSTRs currently reported as susceptible to unstable expansion in human disease are spatially co-localized to boundaries of 3D genome domains in human ESCs (Figure 1C). We next set out to determine how the boundary localization of daSTRs compared to the genome-wide expectation of matched normal-length repeats. To ensure a rigorous null model, we compared the daSTR loci in hg19 to all other normal-length STR tracts genome-wide matched by repeat unit sequence, normal-length range, and gene body placement (Tables S1 and S2; STAR Methods). We found that daSTRs are significantly closer to domain boundaries compared to matched repeat tracts (0 bp versus 5,203 bp median; p = 0.00074 Mann-Whitney U test; p = 0.0037, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) (Figure 2A). Moreover, daSTRs showed significantly higher enrichment at domain boundaries compared to other normal-length, matched repeat sequences (odds ratio = 4.77, Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.00056, Figure 2B). We confirmed that the effect was largely unchanged (odds ratio = 4.23) when performing the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. This striking boundary enrichment is a conservative estimate given that some daSTRs are located at visually apparent domain boundaries missed by the conservative thresholds used in this manuscripts' domain-calling analysis. We also computed bootstrapped confidence intervals for the percentage of repeat tracts located at boundaries (STAR Methods). The mean percentage of drawn repeats tracts that are boundary-associated increased from 49.5% (bootstrapped 95% confidence interval [CI]: 30.3% < μpercent_boundary < 68.6%) in matched repeats compared to 81.1% (bootstrapped 95% CI: 66.2% < μpercent_boundary < 96.0%) in daSTRs, respectively (Figure 2C). Finally, we conducted a randomization test and demonstrated that daSTRs are significantly closer to domain boundaries compared to the genome-wide null distribution of matched repeats (empirical p = 0.0001, Figure 2D). Together, our data indicate that loci susceptible to pathologic, unstable repeat expansion are significantly closer to domain boundaries than expected genome-wide by matched, normal-length repeat sequences. We next set out to determine if the strong enrichment of daSTRs at domain boundaries was specific to ESCs or more generalizable across lineages. Due to the read depth and resolution limits of Hi-C data published to date, subTAD boundaries have not been reported genome-wide across multiple human cell types. Therefore, we focused on only Mb-scale TADs reported in an independent study by Schmitt et al., 2016Schmitt A.D. Hu M. Jung I. Xu Z. Qiu Y. Tan C.L. Li Y. Lin S. Lin Y. Barr C.L. Ren B.

For ATXN3 and ATXN10, line is drawn from midpoint of gene since repeat location was unable to be identified in the mm9 reference genome. To understand genome folding in a tissue relevant to the subset of STR expansions linked to neurological dysfunction (Table S1), we next analyzed recently published Hi-C data from human fetal cortical plate tissue (Won et al., 2016Won H. de la Torre-Ubieta L.

We applied the DI+HMM method to detect 2,102 TADs and the DI+HMM and 3DNetMod methods to identify the full sweep of 11,206 subTADs in human cortical plate Hi-C (Table S4; STAR Methods). We focused our analysis on the 23 daSTR loci that to our knowledge are associated with neurological or neuromuscular disorders. Consistent with our observations in human ES cells, we found 8 out of the 23 neurological daSTR loci were detected at TAD boundaries in human fetal cortical plate tissue (Figure 3A). An additional 8 and 5 daSTRs localized to subTAD and qualitatively apparent boundaries, respectively (Figures 3B and S4A–S4C). These results indicate that the majority of the neurological disease-associated daSTRs (21 out of 23) are located at domain boundaries in human cortical tissue (Figure 3C). Thus, although the target cell type(s) for many unstable repeat expansion disorders are unknown, the strong enrichment at boundaries regardless of tissue origin suggests that daSTR co-localization with boundaries might be robust across cell types relevant for disease pathology.Figure S4The Majority of Disease-Associated STRs Are Positioned at Domain Boundaries in Human Cortical Plate Neurons, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A–C) Heatmaps of 40-kilobase binned Hi-C data in human cortical plate neurons for daSTR loci co-localized with (A) subTAD boundaries called using 3DNetMod, (B) qualitative boundaries, or (C) not at boundary.

Genes (green) containing the daSTR (red) are shown in the tracks below heatmaps. Domain boundaries at the daSTR are demarcated with a black arrow. Due to the diversity of daSTR attributes (Tables S1, S2, and S3), we sought to understand if a particular repeat class was driving the co-localization with boundaries. We stratified our daSTRs into 4 main groups: (1) a CAG repeat unit in exons or 5′UTR (n = 9), (2) a GCG repeat unit in exons or 5′UTR (n = 8), (3) repeat units in introns (n = 5), and (4) a CTG repeat unit in 3′UTRs (n = 3) (Table S3; STAR Methods). Although statistical power was restricted by the small size of the groups, all four classes of daSTRs showed enrichment at boundaries compared to other normal-length repeats matched by sequence and gene body location (Figure S5A). Together, these results indicate that multiple diverse classes of daSTRs are significantly enriched at domain boundaries compared to their matched, normal-length repeat tracts genome-wide. We next sought to understand the genetic and epigenetic features enriched at chromatin domain boundaries. Consistent with previous reports, we found enrichment for the architectural protein CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) at human ESC boundaries compared to loci internal to domains (Figures S6A and S6B) (Dixon et al., 2012Dixon J.R.

Notably, we also observed a marked increase in the density of CpG islands at boundaries versus non-boundaries, whereas classic repressive chromatin marks such as H3K9me3 were slightly depleted at boundaries compared to loci internal to domains. Two classes of boundaries emerge: boundaries with high CpG island density and boundaries depleted of CpG islands (Figures S6C and S6D). These results demonstrate that a subclass of TAD/subTAD boundaries represent hotspots in the genome of ultra-high density of CTCF occupancy and CpG islands. To understand the relationship between STRs, CpG islands, and boundaries, we stratified boundaries into those with daSTRs, those with normal-length matched repeat tracts, and those that do not contain repeats.

We showed that during C. elegans embryogenesis, PGL granules assemble via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), and their size and biophysical properties determine their susceptibility to autophagic degradation. The receptor SEPA-1 promotes LLPS of PGL-1/-3, while the scaffold protein EPG-2 controls the size of PGL-1/-3 compartments and converts them into less dynamic gel-like structures. Under heat-stress conditions, mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of PGL-1/-3 is elevated and PGL-1/-3 undergo accelerated phase separation, forming PGL granules that are resistant to autophagic degradation. Significantly, accumulation of PGL granules is an adaptive response to maintain embryonic viability during heat stress. We revealed that mTORC1-mediated LLPS of PGL-1/-3 acts as a switch-like stress sensor, coupling phase separation to autophagic degradation and adaptation to stress during development."

Here we report on quantitative analyses of lineage tracing data from primary colon cancer xenograft tissue to assess CSC functionality in a human solid malignancy. The temporally obtained clone size distribution data support a model in which stem cell function in established cancers is not intrinsically, but is entirely spatiotemporally orchestrated. Functional stem cells that drive tumour expansion predominantly reside at the tumour edge, close to cancer-associated fibroblasts. Hence, stem cell properties change in time depending on the cell location. Furthermore, although chemotherapy enriches for cells with a CSC phenotype, in this context functional stem cell properties are also fully defined by the microenvironment. To conclude, we identified osteopontin as a key cancer-associated fibroblast-produced factor that drives in situ clonogenicity in colon cancer."

However, the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for the pathogenicity of ZIKV remain largely unknown. Here we use human neural progenitor cells and the neuronal cell line SK-N-BE2 in an integrated proteomics approach to characterize the cellular responses to viral infection at the proteome and phosphoproteome level, and use affinity proteomics to identify cellular targets of ZIKV proteins. Using this approach, we identify 386 ZIKV-interacting proteins, ZIKV-specific and pan-flaviviral activities as well as host factors with known functions in neuronal development, retinal defects and infertility. Moreover, our analysis identified 1,216 phosphorylation sites that are specifically up- or downregulated after ZIKV infection, indicating profound modulation of fundamental signalling pathways such as AKT, MAPK–ERK and ATM–ATR and thereby providing mechanistic insights into the proliferation arrest elicited by ZIKV infection. Functionally, our integrative study identifies ZIKV host-dependency factors and provides a comprehensive framework for a system-level understanding of ZIKV-induced perturbations at the levels of proteins and cellular pathways. Integrative analyses identify host proteins that are modulated by Zika virus at multiple levels and provide a comprehensive framework for the understanding of Zika virus-induced changes to cellular pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2888437865,"Antibodies are the primary correlate of protection for most licensed vaccines; however, their mechanisms of protection may vary, ranging from physical blockade to clearance via the recruitment of innate immunity. Here, we uncover striking functional diversity in vaccine-induced antibodies that is driven by immunization site and is associated with reduced risk of SIV infection in nonhuman primates. While equivalent levels of protection were observed following intramuscular (IM) and aerosol (AE) immunization with an otherwise identical DNA prime-Ad5 boost regimen, reduced risk of infection was associated with IgG-driven antibody-dependent monocyte-mediated phagocytosis in the IM vaccinees, but with vaccine-elicited IgA-driven neutrophil-mediated phagocytosis in AE-immunized animals. Thus, although route-independent correlates indicate a critical role for phagocytic Fc-effector activity in protection from SIV, the site of immunization may drive this Fc activity via distinct innate effector cells and antibody isotypes. Moreover, the same correlates predicted protection from SHIV infection in a second nonhuman primate vaccine trial using a disparate IM canarypox prime-protein boost strategy, analogous to that used in the first moderately protective human HIV vaccine trial. These data identify orthogonal functional humoral mechanisms, initiated by distinct vaccination routes and immunization strategies, pointing to multiple, potentially complementary correlates of immunity that may support the rational design of a protective vaccine against HIV."

However, the mechanisms accounting for aberrant synaptic connectivity in the context of CD8+ T cell-driven neuronal damage are poorly understood. Here, we profiled the neuronal translatome in a murine model of encephalitis caused by CD8+ T cells targeting antigenic neurons. Neuronal STAT1 signaling and downstream CCL2 expression were essential for apposition of phagocytes, ensuing synaptic loss and neurological disease. Analogous observations were made in the brains of Rasmussen's encephalitis patients. In this devastating CD8+ T cell-driven autoimmune disease, neuronal STAT1 phosphorylation and CCL2 expression co-clustered with infiltrating CD8+ T cells as well as phagocytes. Taken together, our findings uncover an active role of neurons in coordinating phagocyte-mediated synaptic loss and highlight neuronal STAT1 and CCL2 as critical steps in this process that are amenable to pharmacological interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2889387664,"Multicellular organisms use cell-surface receptor kinases to sense and process extracellular signals. Many plant receptor kinases are activated by the formation of ligand-induced complexes with shape-complementary co-receptors1. The best-characterized co-receptor is BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1-ASSOCIATED KINASE 1 (BAK1), which associates with numerous leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases (LRR-RKs) to control immunity, growth and development2. Here we report key regulatory events that control the function of BAK1 and, more generally, LRR-RKs. Through a combination of phosphoproteomics and targeted mutagenesis, we identified conserved phosphosites that are required for the immune function of BAK1 in Arabidopsis thaliana. Notably, these phosphosites are not required for BAK1-dependent brassinosteroid-regulated growth. In addition to revealing a critical role for the phosphorylation of the BAK1 C-terminal tail, we identified a conserved tyrosine phosphosite that may be required for the function of the majority of Arabidopsis LRR-RKs, and which separates them into two distinct functional classes based on the presence or absence of this tyrosine. Our results suggest a phosphocode-based dichotomy of BAK1 function in plant signalling, and provide insights into receptor kinase activation that have broad implications for our understanding of how plants respond to their changing environment."
https://openalex.org/W2889228272,"Nervous system function relies on the polarized architecture of neurons, established by directional transport of pre- and postsynaptic cargoes. While delivery of postsynaptic components depends on the secretory pathway, the identity of the membrane compartment(s) supplying presynaptic active zone (AZ) and synaptic vesicle (SV) proteins is unclear. Live imaging in Drosophila larvae and mouse hippocampal neurons provides evidence that presynaptic biogenesis depends on axonal co-transport of SV and AZ proteins in presynaptic lysosome-related vesicles (PLVs). Loss of the lysosomal kinesin adaptor Arl8 results in the accumulation of SV- and AZ-protein-containing vesicles in neuronal cell bodies and a corresponding depletion of SV and AZ components from presynaptic sites, leading to impaired neurotransmission. Conversely, presynaptic function is facilitated upon overexpression of Arl8. Our data reveal an unexpected function for a lysosome-related organelle as an important building block for presynaptic biogenesis."

However, the evolutionary and genetic relationships among co-existing lesions are unclear. Here we analysed the somatic variants of pancreatic cancers and precursor lesions sampled from distinct regions of the same pancreas. After inferring evolutionary relationships, we found that the ancestral cell had initiated and clonally expanded to form one or more lesions, and that subsequent driver gene mutations eventually led to invasive pancreatic cancer. We estimate that this multi-step progression generally spans many years. These new data reframe the step-wise progression model of pancreatic cancer by illustrating that independent, high-grade pancreatic precursor lesions observed in a single pancreas often represent a single neoplasm that has colonized the ductal system, accumulating spatial and genetic divergence over time."

We found two daily peaks of BM HSPC activity that are initiated by onset of light and darkness providing this coupling. Both peaks follow transient elevation of BM norepinephrine and TNF secretion, which temporarily increase HSPC reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Light-induced norepinephrine and TNF secretion augments HSPC differentiation and increases vascular permeability to replenish the blood. In contrast, darkness-induced TNF increases melatonin secretion to drive renewal of HSPCs and LT-HSC potential through modulating surface CD150 and c-Kit expression, increasing COX-2/αSMA+ macrophages, diminishing vascular permeability, and reducing HSPC ROS levels. These findings reveal that light- and darkness-induced daily bursts of norepinephrine, TNF, and melatonin within the BM are essential for synchronized mature blood cell production and HSPC pool repopulation."

This study aimed to explore the impact of a community-based training programme for caregivers of children with cerebral palsy in Ghana. Methods A pre and post evaluation of an 11-month participatory training programme (“Getting to Know Cerebral Palsy”) offered through a parent group model, was conducted. Eight community groups, consisting of a total of 75 caregivers and their children with cerebral palsy (aged 18 months-12 years), were enrolled from 8 districts across Ghana. Caregivers were interviewed at baseline, and again at 2 months after the completion of the programme, to assess: quality of life (PedsQL™ Family Impact Module); knowledge about their child’s condition; child health indicators; feeding practices. Severity of cerebral palsy, reported illness, and anthropometric measurements were also assessed. Results Of the child-caregiver pairs, 64 (84%) were included in final analysis. There were significant improvements in caregiver quality of life score (QoL) (median total QoL 12.5 at baseline to 51.4 at endline, P<0.001). Caregivers reported significant improvements in knowledge and confidence in caring for their child (p<0.001), in some aspects of child feeding practices (p<0.001) and in their child’s physical and emotional heath (p< 0.001). Actual frequency of reported serious illness over 12-months remained high (67%) among children, however, a small reduction in recent illness episodes (past 2 weeks) was seen (64% to 50% p < 0.05). Malnutrition was common at both time points; 63% and 65% of children were classified as underweight at baseline and endline respectively (p = 0.5). Conclusion Children with cerebral palsy have complex care and support needs which in low and middle-income settings need to be met by their family. This study demonstrates that a participatory training, delivered through the establishment of a local support group, with an emphasis on caregiver empowerment, resulted in improved caregiver QoL. Despite less effect on effect on child health and no clear effect on nutritional status, this alone is an important outcome. Whilst further development of these programmes would be helpful, and is underway, there is clear need for wider scale-up of an intervention which provides support to families."

Here, to elucidate its etiology, we performed a genome-wide association study of diverticular disease (27,444 cases; 382,284 controls) from the UK Biobank and tested for replication in the Michigan Genomics Initiative (2,572 cases; 28,649 controls). We identified 42 loci associated with diverticular disease; 39 of these loci are novel. Using data-driven expression-prioritized integration for complex traits (DEPICT), we show that genes in these associated regions are significantly enriched for expression in mesenchymal stem cells and multiple connective tissue cell types and are co-expressed with genes that have a role in vascular and mesenchymal biology. Genes in these associated loci have roles in immunity, extracellular matrix biology, cell adhesion, membrane transport and intestinal motility. Phenome-wide association analysis of the 42 variants shows a common etiology of diverticular disease with obesity and hernia. These analyses shed light on the genomic landscape of diverticular disease. Genome-wide analyses identify 42 risk loci for diverticular disease, 39 of which are new.

Layer 1 (L1) axons came to exhibit activity at lever-pull initiation and termination, while layer 3 (L3) axons did so at lever-pull initiation. L1 population activity had a sequence structure related to both lever-pull duration and reproducibility. Stimulation of the substantia nigra pars reticulata activated more L1 than L3 axons, whereas deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) stimulation did the opposite. Lesions to either the dorsal striatum or the DCN impaired motor learning and disrupted temporal dynamics in both layers. Thus, layer-specific thalamocortical signals evolve with the progression of learning, which requires both the basal ganglia and cerebellar activities."
https://openalex.org/W2890114223,"Heterogeneous prostatic carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAF) contribute to tumor progression and resistance to androgen signaling deprivation therapy (ADT). CAF subjected to extended passaging, compared to low passage CAF, were found to lose tumor expansion potential and heterogeneity. Cell surface endoglin (CD105), known to be expressed on proliferative endothelia and mesenchymal stem cells, was diminished in high passage CAF. RNA-sequencing revealed SFRP1 to be distinctly expressed by tumor-inductive CAF, which was further demonstrated to occur in a CD105-dependent manner. Moreover, ADT resulted in further expansion of the CD105+ fibroblastic population and downstream SFRP1 in 3-dimensional cultures and patient-derived xenograft tissues. In patients, CD105+ fibroblasts were found to circumscribe epithelia with neuroendocrine differentiation. CAF-derived SFRP1, driven by CD105 signaling, was necessary and sufficient to induce prostate cancer neuroendocrine differentiation in a paracrine manner. A partially humanized CD105 neutralizing antibody, TRC105, inhibited fibroblastic SFRP1 expression and epithelial neuroendocrine differentiation. In a novel synthetic lethality paradigm, we found that simultaneously targeting the epithelia and its microenvironment with ADT and TRC105, respectively, reduced castrate-resistant tumor progression, in a model where either ADT or TRC105 alone had little effect."

How neural stem cells are maintained throughout development to sustain adult mammalian neurogenesis is not well understood. Here, we show that milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor (EGF) 8 (Mfge8), a known phagocytosis factor, is highly enriched in quiescent RGLs in the dentate gyrus. Mfge8-null mice exhibit decreased adult dentate neurogenesis, and furthermore, adult RGL-specific deletion of Mfge8 leads to RGL overactivation and depletion. Similarly, loss of Mfge8 promotes RGL activation in the early postnatal dentate gyrus, resulting in a decreased number of label-retaining RGLs in adulthood. Mechanistically, loss of Mfge8 elevates mTOR1 signaling in RGLs, inhibition of which by rapamycin returns RGLs to quiescence. Together, our study identifies a neural-stem-cell-enriched niche factor that maintains quiescence and prevents developmental exhaustion of neural stem cells to sustain continuous neurogenesis in the adult mammalian brain."

However, signed annotations quantifying whether each SNP allele promotes or hinders the biological process can enable stronger statements about disease mechanism. We introduce a method, signed linkage disequilibrium profile regression, for detecting genome-wide directional effects of signed functional annotations on disease risk. We validate the method via simulations and application to molecular quantitative trait loci in blood, recovering known transcriptional regulators. We apply the method to expression quantitative trait loci in 48 Genotype-Tissue Expression tissues, identifying 651 transcription factor-tissue associations including 30 with robust evidence of tissue specificity. We apply the method to 46 diseases and complex traits (average n = 290 K), identifying 77 annotation-trait associations representing 12 independent transcription factor-trait associations, and characterize the underlying transcriptional programs using gene-set enrichment analyses. Our results implicate new causal disease genes and new disease mechanisms. Signed linkage disequilibrium profile regression is a new method for detecting directional effects of genomic annotations on disease risk. The results implicate new causal disease genes and can suggest mechanisms underlying the effects of causal genes on disease."
https://openalex.org/W2892001330,"CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) has been suggested to play a critical role in cancer metastasis. Some studies have described CXCR4 nuclear localization in metastatic lesions of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), which has been suggested to be correlated with cancer metastasis. However, the underlying mechanism and clinical significance of CXCR4 nuclear localization remains unknown. Here, we show that CXCR4 nuclear localization is more likely to occur in RCC tissues, especially in metastases, and is associated with poor prognosis. CXCR4 nuclear localization requires its nuclear localization sequence (NLS, residues 146-RPRK-149). After the mutation of NLS in CXCR4, CXCR4 nuclear localization in RCC cells is lost. Nuclear localization of CXCR4 promoted RCC tumorigenicity both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we found that CXCR4 and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) colocalized in RCC cells and interacted with each other. Moreover, CXCR4 nuclear localization promoted nuclear accumulation of HIF-1α, thereby promoting the expression of genes downstream of HIF-1α. Reciprocally, nuclear HIF-1α promoted CXCR4 transcription, thus forming a feed-forward loop. Subcellular CXCR4 and HIF-1α expression levels were independent adverse prognostic factors and could be combined with TNM stage to generate a predictive nomogram of the clinical outcome of patients with RCC. Therefore, our findings indicate that CXCR4 nuclear translocation plays a critical role in RCC metastasis and may serve as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2889778242,"Genomic instability is a hallmark feature of cancer cells, and can be caused by defective DNA repair, for instance due to inactivation of BRCA2. Paradoxically, loss of Brca2 in mice results in embryonic lethality, whereas cancer cells can tolerate BRCA2 loss. This holds true for multiple DNA repair genes, and suggests that cancer cells are molecularly “rewired” to cope with defective DNA repair and the resulting high levels of genomic instability. In this study, we aim to identify genes that genomically unstable cancer cells rely on for their survival. Using functional genomic mRNA (FGmRNA) profiling, 16,172 cancer samples were previously ranked based on their degree of genomic instability. We analyzed the top 250 genes that showed a positive correlation between FGmRNA levels and the degree of genomic instability, in a co-functionality network. Within this co-functionality network, a strong cluster of 11 cell cycle-related genes was identified, including TPX2. We then assessed the dependency on these 11 genes in the context of survival of genomically unstable cancer cells, induced by BRCA2 inactivation. Depletion of TPX2 or its associated kinase Aurora-A preferentially reduced cell viability in a panel of BRCA2-deficient cancer cells. In line with these findings, BRCA2-depleted and BRCA2-mutant human cell lines, or tumor cell lines derived from Brca2–/–;p53–/– mice showed increased sensitivity to the Aurora-A kinase inhibitor alisertib, with delayed mitotic progression and frequent mitotic failure. Our findings reveal that BRCA2-deficient cancer cells show enhanced sensitivity to inactivation of TPX2 or its partner Aurora-A, which points at an actionable dependency of genomically unstable cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2890618054,"Aberrant activation of EGFR represents a common event in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and activates various downstream signaling pathways. While EGFR activation of β-catenin signaling was previously reported, the mediating mechanism remains unclear. Our current study found that EGFR activation in NSCLC cells releases SHC-binging protein 1 (SHCBP1) from SHC adaptor protein 1 (SHC1), which subsequently translocates into the nucleus and directly promotes the transactivating activity of β-catenin, consequently resulting in development of NSCLC cell stemness and malignant progression. Furthermore, SHCBP1 promotes β-catenin activity through enhancing the CBP/β-catenin interaction, and most interestingly, a candidate drug that blocks the CBP/β-catenin binding effectively abrogates the aforementioned biological effects of SHCBP1. Clinically, SHCBP1 level in NSCLC tumors was found to inversely correlate with patient survival. Together, our study establishes a novel convergence between EGFR and β-catenin pathways and highlights a potential significance of SHCBP1 as a prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic target."

We studied the effects of this mutant enzyme in silico, in vitro, and in vivo using gene edited cell lines. The E1099K mutation altered enzyme/substrate binding and enhanced the rate of H3K36 methylation. As a result, cell lines harboring E1099K exhibit increased H3K36 dimethylation and reduced H3K27 trimethylation, particularly on nucleosomes containing histone H3.1. Mutant NSD2 cells exhibit reduced apoptosis and enhanced proliferation, clonogenicity, adhesion, and migration. In mouse xenografts, mutant NSD2 cells are more lethal and brain invasive than wildtype cells. Transcriptional profiling demonstrates that mutant NSD2 aberrantly activates factors commonly associated with neural and stromal lineages in addition to signaling and adhesion genes. Identification of these pathways provides new avenues for therapeutic interventions in NSD2 dysregulated malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2888910754,"Cellular prion protein (PrPC) modulates cell adhesion and signaling in the brain. Conversion to its infectious isoform causes neurodegeneration, including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. PrPC undergoes rapid plasma membrane turnover and extracellular release via exosomes. However, the intracellular transport of PrPC and its potential impact on prion disease progression is barely understood. Here we identify critical components of PrPC trafficking that also link intracellular and extracellular PrPC turnover. PrPC associates with muskelin, dynein, and KIF5C at transport vesicles. Notably, muskelin coordinates bidirectional PrPC transport and facilitates lysosomal degradation over exosomal PrPC release. Muskelin gene knockout consequently causes PrPC accumulation at the neuronal surface and on secreted exosomes. Moreover, prion disease onset is accelerated following injection of pathogenic prions into muskelin knockout mice. Our data identify an essential checkpoint in PrPC turnover. They propose a novel connection between neuronal intracellular lysosome targeting and extracellular exosome trafficking, relevant to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2889777908,"The mechanism of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα)-positive breast cancer-associated bone metastasis is poorly understood. In this article, we report that nuclear p21-activated kinase 4 (nPAK4) is a novel repressor of ERα-mediated transactivation in a 17β-estradiol (E2)-dependent manner and promotes PAK4–ERα axis-mediated bone metastasis by targeting leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) in ERα-positive breast cancer. An evaluation of clinical breast cancer samples revealed that nPAK4 is linked to ERα expression and appears to be associated with a poor prognosis in bone metastatic breast cancer. PAK4 bound and co-translocated with ERα from the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon stimulation with E2. nPAK4 enhanced the invasive potential of ERα-positive breast cancer cells in vitro and promoted breast cancer metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, nPAK4 promoted the metastasis of ERα-positive breast cancer cells by targeting LIFR, a bone metastasis suppressor. Strikingly, the nuclear accumulation of PAK4 might promote aggressive phenotypes, highlighting nPAK4 as a novel predictive biomarker for ERα-positive breast cancer bone metastasis."

https://openalex.org/W2888902590,"By priming brain circuits, associations between low-salience stimuli often guide future behavioral choices through a process known as mediated or inferred learning. However, the precise neurobiological mechanisms of these incidental associations are largely unknown. Using sensory preconditioning procedures, we show that type 1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1R) in hippocampal GABAergic neurons are necessary and sufficient for mediated but not direct learning. Deletion and re-expression of CB1R in hippocampal GABAergic neurons abolishes and rescues mediated learning, respectively. Interestingly, paired presentations of low-salience sensory cues induce a specific protein synthesis-dependent enhancement of hippocampal CB1R expression and facilitate long-term synaptic plasticity at inhibitory synapses. CB1R blockade or chemogenetic manipulations of hippocampal GABAergic neurons upon preconditioning affect incidental associations, as revealed by impaired mediated learning. Thus, CB1R-dependent control of inhibitory hippocampal neurotransmission mediates incidental associations, allowing future associative inference, a fundamental process for everyday life, which is altered in major neuropsychiatric diseases.Video AbstracteyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiJkNTVlY2IxZGViMTc4MDVlNWU5NTRiOGY1ZmE1NDlhYSIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc5MzU5Nzk5fQ.jW_LD-lLBc6ie7ULv7v99ykXFSO58I2-eS0GhNOFvxXc4SGJ44W57JmbRDxhWI7IkxyZOWwuFXEH5H3JnYRtnX2OWyFenhepObYAMo5WmRTtF2eDql_ywlzsP6BJprQWGK3B3OMUMduy90gzLyOfJM1nq8xUpwZU4_Rcv4TDfI0XyLMK4MkFwFtHDrwcx0E15RMfhgmhPg3cNWpwF-lbx5F-JtCtOyTtZ9BGvk853PNqFaebfyVRu2q1olYlIVLjoVtTwzAJTXjjJid5GBXhSUXT_CaEUbbUtd5ilBOPUa5-HAtCKhTjOIctX5FbKrmVu2iP2VQBV5PniqfARsjaCg(mp4, (49.01 MB) Download video"
https://openalex.org/W2889475247,"The subthreshold mechanisms that underlie neuronal correlations in awake animals are poorly understood. Here, we perform dual whole-cell recordings in the visual cortex (V1) of awake mice to investigate membrane potential (Vm) correlations between upper-layer sensory neurons. We find that the membrane potentials of neighboring neurons display large, correlated fluctuations during quiet wakefulness, including pairs of cells with disparate tuning properties. These fluctuations are driven by correlated barrages of excitation followed closely by inhibition (∼5-ms lag). During visual stimulation, low-frequency activity is diminished, and coherent high-frequency oscillations appear, even for non-preferred stimuli. These oscillations are generated by alternating excitatory and inhibitory inputs at a similar lag. The temporal sequence of depolarization for pairs of neurons is conserved during both spontaneous- and visually-evoked activity, suggesting a stereotyped flow of activation that may function to produce temporally precise ""windows of opportunity"" for additional synaptic inputs."

https://openalex.org/W2825546374,"Duramycin is a heavily post-translationally modified peptide that binds phosphatidylethanolamine. It has been investigated as an antibiotic, an inhibitor of viral entry, a therapeutic for cystic fibrosis, and a tumor and vasculature imaging agent. Duramycin contains a β-hydroxylated Asp (Hya) and four macrocycles, including an essential lysinoalanine (Lal) cross-link. The mechanism of Lal formation is not known. Here we show that Lal is installed stereospecifically by DurN via addition of Lys19 to a dehydroalanine. The structure of DurN reveals an unusual dimer with a new fold. Surprisingly, in the structure of duramycin bound to DurN, no residues of the enzyme are near the Lal cross-link. Instead, Hya15 of the substrate makes interactions with Lal, suggesting it acts as a base to deprotonate Lys19 during catalysis. Biochemical data suggest that DurN preorganizes the reactive conformation of the substrate, such that the Hya15 of the substrate can serve as the catalytic base for Lal formation. During the biosynthesis of the lanthipeptide duramycin, DurN catalyzes stereospecific lysinoalanine formation by preorganizing the reactive conformation of the substrate, such that one of the substrate’s own residues serves as the catalytic base."

https://openalex.org/W2889410066,"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) are stem cell disorders with risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Gene expression profiling reveals transcriptional expression of GLI1, of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling, in poor-risk MDS/AML. Using a murine model of MDS we demonstrated that constitutive Hh/Gli1 activation accelerated leukemic transformation and decreased overall survival. Hh/Gli1 activation resulted in clonal expansion of phenotypically defined granulocyte macrophage progenitors (GMPs) and acquisition of self-renewal potential in a non-self-renewing progenitor compartment. Transcriptome analysis of GMPs revealed enrichment in gene signatures of self-renewal pathways, operating via direct Gli1 activation. Using human cell lines we demonstrated that in addition to canonical Hh signaling, GLI1 is activated in a Smoothened-independent manner. GLI1 knockdown or inhibition with GANT61 resulted in decreased proliferation and clonogenic potential. Our data suggest that GLI1 activation is frequent in MDS during disease progression and inhibition of GLI1 is an attractive therapeutic target for a subset of patients."
https://openalex.org/W2888902489,"Most prostate cancer cases remain indolent for long periods of time, but metastatic progression quickly worsens the prognosis and leads to mortality. However, little is known about what promotes the metastasis of prostate cancer and there is a lack of effective prognostic indicators, making it immensely difficult to manage options for treatment or surveillance. Arginyltransferase 1 (Ate1) is the enzyme mediating post-translational protein arginylation, which has recently been identified as a master regulator affecting many cancer-relevant pathways including stress response, cell cycle checkpoints, and cell migration/adhesion. However, the precise role of Ate1 in cancer remains unknown. In this study, we found the occurrence of metastasis of prostate cancer is inversely correlated with the levels of Ate1 protein and mRNA in the primary tumor. We also found that metastatic prostate cancer cell lines have a reduced level of Ate1 protein compared to non-metastatic cell lines, and that a depletion of Ate1 drives prostate cancer cells towards more aggressive pro-metastatic phenotypes without affecting proliferation rates. Furthermore, we demonstrated that a reduction of Ate1 can result from chronic stress, and that shRNA-reduced Ate1 increases cellular resistance to stress, and drives spontaneous and stress-induced genomic mutations. Finally, by using a prostate orthotropic xenograft mouse model, we found that a reduction of Ate1 was sufficient to enhance the metastatic phenotypes of prostate cancer cell line PC-3 in vivo. Our study revealed a novel role of Ate1 in suppressing prostate cancer metastasis, which has a profound significance for establishing metastatic indicators for prostate cancer, and for finding potential treatments to prevent its metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2949122381,"Accurate protein structure prediction from amino acid sequence is still an unsolved problem. The most reliable methods centre on template based modelling. However, the accuracy of these models entirely depends on the availability of experimentally resolved homologous template structures. In order to generate more accurate models, extensive physics based molecular dynamics (MD) refinement simulations are performed to sample many different conformations to find improved conformational states. In this study, we propose a deep recurrent network model, called DeepTrajectory, that is able to identify these improved conformational states, with high precision, from a variety of different MD based sampling protocols. The proposed model learns the temporal patterns of features computed from MD trajectory data in order to classify whether each recorded simulation snapshot is an improved quality conformational state, decreased quality conformational state or whether there is no perceivable change in state with respect to the starting conformation. The model was trained and tested on 904 trajectories from 42 different protein systems with a cumulative number of more than 1.7 million snapshots. We show that our model outperforms other state of the art machine-learning algorithms that do not consider temporal dependencies. To our knowledge, DeepTrajectory is the first implementation of a time-dependent deep-learning protocol that is re-trainable and able to adapt to any new MD based sampling procedure, thereby demonstrating how a neural network can be used to learn the latter part of the protein folding funnel."
https://openalex.org/W2890195365,"Our previous studies revealed that GADD45α is a liable protein, which undergoes MDM2-dependent constitutive ubiquitination and degradation in resting HepG2 hepatoma cells. Arsenite exposure induces ribosomal stress responses mediated by the ribosomal protein S7, which can block MDM2 activity and result in GADD45α accumulation and cell apoptosis. In the present study, we found that one of the catalytic subunits of IκB kinase (IKK), IKKβ, exerted a novel IKKα- and NF-κB-independent function in stabilizing MDM2 and therefore contributed to ubiquitination-dependent degradation of GADD45α in resting HepG2 cells. Arsenite stimulation induced transactivation of p53, which formed a complex with its downstream target, Ets-1, and then synergistically repressed IKKβ transcription, reduced MDM2 stability, and ultimately removed the inhibitory effect of MDM2 on GADD45α induction. In addition, DAPK1 functioned as an upstream protein kinase triggering p53/Ets-1-dependent IKKβ and MDM2 reduction and GADD45α accumulation, thus promoting apoptosis in HepG2 cells. Subsequent studies further revealed that the activation of the DAPK1/p53/Ets-1/IKKβ/MDM2/GADD45α cascade was a common signaling event in mediating apoptosis of diverse cancer cells induced by arsenite and other tumor therapeutic agents. Therefore, we conclude that data in the current study have revealed a novel role for IKKβ in negatively regulating GADD45α protein stability and the contribution of p53-dependent IKKβ reduction to mediating cancer cell apoptosis."

https://openalex.org/W2765217270,"We develop of a line of work initiated by Curto and Itskov towards understanding the amount of information contained in the spike trains of hippocampal place cells via topology considerations. Previously, it was established that simply knowing which groups of place cells fire together in an animal's hippocampus is sufficient to extract the global topology of the animal's physical environment. We model a system where collections of place cells group and ungroup according to short-term plasticity rules. In particular, we obtain the surprising result that in experiments with spurious firing, the accuracy of the extracted topological information decreases with the persistence (beyond a certain regime) of the cell groups. This suggests that synaptic transience, or forgetting, is a mechanism by which the brain counteracts the effects of spurious place cell activity."
https://openalex.org/W2889995803,"The high-throughput, label-free Corning Epic assay has applications in drug discovery, pharmacogenomics, cell receptor signaling, cell migration, and viral titration. The utility of Epic technology for biocompatibility testing has not been well established. In manufacturing of medical devices, in vitro and in vivo biocompatibility assessments are mandatory, according to ISO 10993. The new medical device regulation MDR 745/2017 specifies that ex vivo assays that can closely recapitulate in vivo scenarios are needed to better evaluate biomedical devices. We propose herein that Epic technology—which enables detection of variations in cell mass distribution—is suitable for biocompatibility screening of compounds. In this study, we challenged primary human osteoblasts, endothelial cells, and neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells with specific concentrations of methyl methacrylate (MMA). Polymeric MMA has long been applied in cranioplasty, where it makes contact with multiple cell types. Application of Epic technology yielded real-time cytotoxicity profiles for all considered cell types. The results were compared with those from microscopic observation of the same culture plate used in the Epic analyses. The Epic assay should be further examined for its utility for cell biology, genomics, and proteomics companion assays. Our results suggest that Epic technology can be applied to biocompatibility evaluation of human cells in medical device development."
https://openalex.org/W2891140883,"An exhaust plume gas flow from a bipropellant thruster has been recognized as a potential source of a load, heat, and contamination on the exposed satellite components which can especially degrade the optical properties and performance of solar panel. Therefore, accurate predictions of a bipropellant thruster plume gas flow and assessments of its influences should be considered at the design phase of a satellite. The objective of the present study is to investigate the plume gas flow behavior of a small bipropellant thruster and to evaluate its influence on the solar array of a GEO satellite numerically. To deal with complex plume flow regimes efficiently, the combined approach of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) was applied depending on the flow characteristic conditions. Throughout the numerical results of the present study, the influences of the plume gas flow exhausted from a single bipropellant thruster were considered for the disturbance, heat, and contamination of the three-dimensional satellite configuration equipped with a large solar array."
https://openalex.org/W2891205785,"While developing semiconductors, post-silicon validation is an important step to identify the errors that are not detected during the pre-silicon verification and manufacturing testing phases. When the design complexity increases, the required debug time also increases because additional debug data are required to identify the errors. In this study, we present a debug scheme that improves the error identification capability. The proposed debug approach concurrently generates three types of signatures using hierarchical multiple-input signature registers (MISRs). The error-suspect debug cycles are determined by analyzing the debug cycles that are commonly contained in the erroneous signatures of the three MISRs. To reduce the amount of debug data, we compare the high-level MISR signatures in real time with the golden signatures; further, we handle the remaining two MISRs based on the tag bits that are obtained from the results of the high-level MISR. The experimental results prove that the proposed debug structure can significantly improve the error identification capability using less debug data than that used in previous debug structure."
