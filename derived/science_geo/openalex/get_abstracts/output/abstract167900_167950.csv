It has been a long standing controversy as to which of these photoproduct is responsible for mutations in mammalian cells. Here we have introduced photoproduct-specific DNA photolyases into a mouse cell line carrying the transgenic mutation reporter genes <i>lacI</i> and<i>cII</i>. Exposure of the photolyase-expressing cell lines to photoreactivating light resulted in almost complete repair of either CPDs or (6-4)PPs within less than 3 h. The mutations produced by the remaining, nonrepaired photoproducts were scored. The mutant frequency in the <i>cII</i> gene after photoreactivation by CPD photolyase was reduced from 127 × 10<sup>−5</sup> to 34 × 10<sup>−5</sup> (background, 8–10 × 10<sup>−5</sup>). Photoreactivation with (6-4) photolyase did not lower the mutant frequency appreciably. In the <i>lacI</i> gene the mutant frequency after photoreactivation repair of CPDs was reduced from 148 × 10<sup>−5</sup> to 28 × 10<sup>−5</sup>(background, 6–10 × 10<sup>−5</sup>). Mutation spectra obtained with and without photoreactivation by CPD photolyase indicated that the remaining mutations were derived from background mutations, unrepaired CPDs, and other DNA photopoducts including perhaps a small contribution from (6-4)PPs. We conclude that CPDs are responsible for at least 80% of the UVB-induced mutations in this mammalian cell model."

A key regulator of this substrate switching in the hypertrophied heart is peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα). We tested the hypothesis that down-regulation of PPARα is an essential component of cardiac hypertrophy at the levels of increased mass, gene expression, and metabolism by pharmacologically reactivating PPARα. Pressure overload (induced by constriction of the ascending aorta for 7 days in rats) resulted in cardiac hypertrophy, increased expression of fetal genes (atrial natriuretic factor and skeletal α-actin), decreased expression of PPARα and PPARα-regulated genes (medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4), and caused substrate switching (measured ex vivo in the isolated working heart preparation). Treatment of rats with the specific PPARα agonist WY-14,643 (8 days) did not affect the trophic response or atrial natriuretic factor induction to pressure overload. However, PPARα activation blocked skeletal α-actin induction, reversed the down-regulation of measured PPARα-regulated genes in the hypertrophied heart, and prevented substrate switching. This PPARα reactivation concomitantly resulted in severe depression of cardiac power and efficiency in the hypertrophied heart (measured ex vivo). Thus, PPARα down-regulation is essential for the maintenance of contractile function of the hypertrophied heart.

At the transcriptional level, the heart reexpresses fetal genes (such as atrial natriuretic factor (ANF)1 and skeletal α-actin) while depressing the expression of various adult isoforms (e.g. cardiac α-actin) (4Komuro I.

At the level of metabolism, the hypertrophied heart increases reliance on glucose as a fuel and depresses fatty acid oxidation (the dominant energy source for the normal heart) (5Allard M.F.

Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). This nuclear receptor regulates the expression of several genes involved in both fatty acid and glucose oxidation. These include the fatty acid transporter (FAT/CD36), fatty acid-binding protein, malonyl-CoA decarboxylase, muscle-specific carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, medium and long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases, as well as pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (11Brandt J.M.

For example, increased fatty acids in the diabetic milieu result in activation of PPARα, induction of PPARα-regulated genes, and increased fatty acid oxidation with depression of glucose oxidation (17Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1870) Google Scholar, 18Stanley W.C. Lopaschuk G.D. McCormack J.G. Cardiovasc. Res. 1997; 34: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). In contrast, increased reliance of the hypertrophied heart on glucose as a fuel is associated with decreased PPARα expression and DNA binding activity (10Barger P.M. Kelly D.P. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 19Barger P.M. Brandt J.M. Leone T.C. Weinheimer C.J. Kelly D.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1723-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Despite these observations, no study has directly linked substrate switching of the heart with altered PPARα activity. Metabolism and contractile function of the heart are closely linked. We therefore set out to test the hypothesis that substrate switching in response to pressure overload was essential for the development of a hypertrophied heart that was able to maintain cardiac output. This hypothesis was tested by pharmacologically reactivating PPARα in the hypertrophied heart through treatment of rats with the specific PPARα agonist WY-14,643. Treatment of rats with WY-14,643 did not affect the trophic response or induction of ANF in response to pressure overload. However, PPARα activation prevented skeletal α-actin induction, reversed the down-regulation of measured PPARα-regulated genes in the hypertrophied heart, and prevented substrate switching. This PPARα reactivation concomitantly resulted in severe depression of cardiac power and efficiency in the hypertrophied heart. Therefore, down-regulation of PPARα in response to pressure overload is essential for the maintenance of contractile function of the hypertrophied heart. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (initial weight, 225 g) were kept in the Animal Care Center of the University of Texas-Houston Medical School under controlled conditions (23 ± 1 °C; 12-h light/12-h dark cycle) and received standard laboratory powdered chow (Purina) and water ad libitum. Two interventions were utilized in the present study, pressure overload-induced hypertrophy (through banding of the ascending aorta) and chronic PPARα activation (through feeding animals the specific PPARα agonist WY-14,643 in powdered chow at a concentration of 0.01% w/w). On day −1, animals were initiated on the powdered diet with or without added agonist (agonist group and control group, respectively). These diets were maintained throughout the course of the study (a total of 8 days). On day 0, animals underwent surgery with or without aortic banding (banded group and sham group, respectively), as described previously (7Kleinman L.H. Wechsler A.S. Rembert J.C. Fedor J.M. Greenfield J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 234: H515-H519PubMed Google Scholar). Animals were therefore randomly divided into one of four groups: 1) sham/control (S/C) group, 2) banded/control (B/C) group, 3) sham/agonist (S/A) group, and 4) banded/agonist (B/A) group. On day 7, animals were anesthetized, and hearts were isolated and either perfused (for ex vivo metabolic and functional investigations) or frozen (for gene expression determination). Isolated hearts were perfused using the working heart preparation as described previously (20Goodwin G.W. Taylor C.S. Taegtmeyer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29530-29539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Hearts were initially perfused in the Langendorff mode with Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing 5 mmd-glucose, followed by a 30-min nonrecirculating perfusion in the working mode with Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing 5 mmd-glucose (plus 20 μCi/liter [U-14C]glucose), 0.5 mm sodiuml-lactate (plus 2 μCi/liter [U-14C]lactate), 0.05 mm sodiuml-pyruvate, and 0.4 mm sodium oleate (plus 30 μCi/liter [9,10-3H]oleate) bound to 3% bovine serum albumin (fraction V, fatty acid free; Intergen, Purchase, NY) and 40 microunits/ml insulin (Lilly). After 30 min of perfusion (15 cm H2O preload/100 cm H2O afterload), hearts were freeze-clamped and stored in liquid nitrogen before dry weight determination. Rates of oleate oxidation, carbohydrate oxidation (combination of exogenous glucose and lactate oxidation), and oxygen consumption, as well as cardiac power and efficiency, were determined as described previously (20Goodwin G.W. Taylor C.S. Taegtmeyer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29530-29539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). RNA extraction and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of samples were performed using previously described methods (8Depre C. Shipley G.L. Chen W. Han Q. Doenst T. Moore M.L. Stepkowski S. Davies P.J.A. Taegtmeyer H. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1269-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 21Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal.

Specific quantitative assays were designed from rat sequences available in GenBankTM. Primers and probes were designed from nonconserved sequences of the genes (allowing for isoform specificity), spanning sites where two exons join (splice sites) when such sites are known (preventing recognition of the assay to any potential contaminating genomic DNA). Standard RNA was made for all assays by the T7 polymerase method (Ambion, Austin, TX), using total RNA isolated from the rat heart. The correlation between the Ct (the number of polymerase chain reaction cycles required for the fluorescent signal to reach a detection threshold) and the amount of standard was linear over at least a 5-log range of RNA for all assays (data not shown). The level of transcripts for the constitutive housekeeping gene product cyclophilin was quantitatively measured in each sample to control for sample-to-sample differences in RNA concentration. Polymerase chain reaction data are reported as the number of transcripts/number of cyclophilin molecules. Sequences of the primers and probes utilized in the present study have been published previously (8Depre C. Shipley G.L. Chen W. Han Q. Doenst T. Moore M.L. Stepkowski S. Davies P.J.A. Taegtmeyer H.

Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Statistically significant differences between groups were calculated by the Student's t test. A value ofp < 0.05 was considered significant. One week after the initial ascending aortic constriction, the heart weight and the heart weight/body weight ratio both increased, with no effect on body weight (Table I). This trophic response was also observed when pressure overload was induced in animals that were treated with the PPARα agonist (Table I).

Pressure overload is known to induce the expression of several fetal genes, including ANF and skeletal α-actin. There was a 2.4- and 2.3-fold induction in the steady-state levels of ANF and skeletal α-actin mRNAs, respectively, in response to pressure overload (Fig. 1). Although ANF was also increased in the B/A group, induction of skeletal α-actin in response to pressure overload was severely attenuated by the agonist (Fig. 1). The agonist alone had no effect on either ANF or skeletal α-actin expression (Fig. 1). We investigated the effects of both pressure overload and chronic PPARα activation on the mRNA levels of PPARα and the PPARα-regulated genes, medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4. Pressure overload significantly reduced cardiac PPARα mRNA as well as medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase mRNA (Fig.2). The effect of pressure overload on pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 expression did not reach significance. Treatment of rats with WY-14,643 increased the expression of both medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4, with no effect on PPARα expression (Fig. 2). The mRNA levels of medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 in the banded/agonist group were between those observed in the banded/control and sham/agonist groups (Fig. 2). We investigated the effects of reactivation of PPARα on oxygen consumption and substrate selection in the hypertrophied heart ex vivo, using the isolated working heart preparation. The induction of hypertrophy or treatment of animals with WY-14,643 alone had no effect on oxygen consumption (Fig.3 A). In contrast, the two interventions in combination resulted in a significant reduction in oxygen consumption (Fig. 3 A). Treatment of rats with WY-14,643 alone had no significant effects on either oleate or carbohydrate (glucose plus lactate) oxidation (Fig. 3,B and C). Aortic constriction had reciprocal effects on the rates of oleate and carbohydrate oxidation, although these effects did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 3,B and C). In contrast, the two interventions together tended to reduce the rates of both oleate and carbohydrate oxidation (Fig. 3, B and C). To determine substrate selection of the perfused hearts, the contribution of oleate and carbohydrate oxidation to total oxygen consumption was calculated. This calculation enables substrate selection to be determined, taking into account any changes in oxygen consumption (which is affected by both cardiac efficiency and cardiac work/output). Under our perfusion conditions, the normal heart has a 47% reliance on oleate as a substrate and a 19% reliance on carbohydrate oxidation, whereas the remaining 34% is presumably due to endogenous substrate oxidation (intracellular glycogen, fatty acids, and lipids). The agonist alone had no effect on substrate selection (Fig. 4). Hypertrophy was associated with a decrease in relative oleate oxidation and a reciprocal increase in carbohydrate oxidation (Fig. 4). This substrate switching of the hypertrophied heart was completely abolished in the presence of the agonist (Fig. 4). Cardiac power was determined for all perfused hearts. The hypertrophied hearts were able to maintain the same cardiac power as normal hearts (Fig.5 A). In addition, treatment of rats with the agonist had no effect on cardiac power (Fig.5 A). In contrast, chronic activation of PPARα in the hypertrophied heart resulted in a dramatic decrease in cardiac power (Fig. 5 A). A similar pattern was observed for cardiac efficiency (Fig. 5 B), which was significantly altered in the banded/agonist group (decreased by 52% compared with agonist alone; S/A versus B/A). The present study investigated whether the down-regulation of PPARα is essential for the development of a hypertrophied heart that was able to maintain cardiac output in response to pressure overload. Specifically, we investigated growth, gene expression, function, and metabolism of the hypertrophied heart in which PPARα was chronically reactivated pharmacologically. Pressure overload resulted in an increase in cardiac mass, reexpression of fetal genes, decreased expression of PPARα and PPARα-regulated genes, and increased reliance on carbohydrate oxidation (while depressing fatty acid oxidation), enabling maintenance of contractile function (as compared with a normal heart). Chronic reactivation of PPARα in the hypertrophied heart had no effect on the trophic response or the induction of ANF mRNA in response to pressure overload. However, reactivation of PPARα in the hypertrophied heart prevented the induction of skeletal α-actin mRNA, increased the expression of PPARα-regulated genes to levels comparable with those observed in the normal heart, and prevented substrate switching. This resulted in a concomitant severe depression of cardiac power and efficiency. The results suggest that down-regulation of PPARα is essential for pressure overload-induced substrate switching in the heart and maintenance of cardiac function. Pressure overload induces the activation of multiple signaling cascades involved in the development of hypertrophy (1Sugden P.H. Clerk A. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 725-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 2McKinsey T.A. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 3Sadoshima S. Izumo S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 551-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). This adaptation, which occurs at various levels (trophic, gene expression, and metabolic levels), allows the maintenance of cardiac function in the face of increased pressure. At the trophic level, the cardiomyocyte size increases (hypertrophy), a process requiring increased protein synthesis (1Sugden P.H. Clerk A. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 725-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Several signaling pathways have been suggested to be involved in the trophic response, including those utilizing mitogen-activated protein kinases, extracellular signal-regulated kinases, protein kinase Cs, calcineurin, Ca2+/calmodulin kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and p70S6K (1Sugden P.H. Clerk A. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 725-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 2McKinsey T.A. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For example, overexpression of calcineurin and several protein kinase C isoforms cause cardiac hypertrophy (25Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2219) Google Scholar,26Takeishi Y. Ping P. Bolli R. Kirkpatrick D.L. Hoit B.D. Walsh R.A. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1218-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Conversely, selective inhibition of various individual components often blocks experimentally induced hypertrophy (27Meguro T. Hong C. Asai K. Takagi G. McKinsey T. Olson E. Vatner S. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 28Sadoshima J. Izumo S. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1040-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This redundancy for the pathways involved in the development of cardiac hypertrophy may allow adaptive response to a wide variety of stimuli. The expression of a vast number of genes is altered in the hypertrophied heart. This includes those genes encoding for contractile proteins, signaling proteins, transcription factors, metabolic enzymes, and structural proteins. Commonly reported gene expression markers for the hypertrophied heart include the reexpression of various fetal genes, including ANF, skeletal α-actin, and myosin heavy chain β (8Depre C. Shipley G.L. Chen W. Han Q. Doenst T. Moore M.L. Stepkowski S. Davies P.J.A. Taegtmeyer H. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1269-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). In the case of the latter two fetal genes, the expression of the adult isoforms is decreased (cardiac α-actin and myosin heavy chain α, respectively) in the hypertrophied heart (8Depre C. Shipley G.L. Chen W. Han Q. Doenst T. Moore M.L. Stepkowski S. Davies P.J.A. Taegtmeyer H. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1269-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms involved in altered expression of these genes are complex and have not been elucidated fully, but some overlap exists with the mechanisms involved in the trophic response (with the exception of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and p70S6K, which appear to be exclusive for the growth response) (3Sadoshima S. Izumo S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 551-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, 4Komuro I. Yazaki Y. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 55-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 28Sadoshima J. Izumo S. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1040-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). At the level of metabolism, the hypertrophied heart decreases its reliance on fatty acids as a major substrate for ATP generation while increasing its reliance on glucose as a fuel (5Allard M.F. Schonekess B.O. Henning S.L. English D.R. Lopaschuk G.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: H742-H750PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kagaya Y. Kanno Y. Takeyama D. Ishide N. Maruyama Y. Takahashi T. Ido T. Takishima T. Circulation. 1990; 81: 1353-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Although the exact mechanism for this substrate switching is not known, the transcription factor PPARα is a strong candidate to play a role. The hypertrophied heart possesses decreased expression of several genes encoding for key proteins involved in fatty acid metabolism (e.g. FAT/CD36, fatty acid-binding protein, malonyl-CoA decarboxylase, muscle-specific carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase) (10Barger P.M. Kelly D.P. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 15Young M.E. Goodwin G.W. Ying J. Guthrie P. Wilson C.R. Laws F.A. Taegtmeyer H. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 280: E471-E479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many of these genes are regulated by PPARα, which has been shown to be down-regulated (both transcriptionally and posttranscriptionally) in the hypertrophied heart (19Barger P.M. Brandt J.M. Leone T.C. Weinheimer C.J. Kelly D.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1723-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). We set out to investigate the role of decreased PPARα in the development of the hypertrophied heart in response to pressure overload. Such a study would help to clarify several questions. First, is decreased PPARα essential for substrate switching in the hypertrophied heart? Second, does decreased PPARα play a role, either directly or indirectly (through substrate switching for example), in the trophic and/or gene expression changes observed in response to pressure overload? And third, is decreased PPARα essential for the maintenance of contractile function of the hypertrophied heart? Consistent with previously published studies, our results show that pressure overload results in substrate switching by the heart (i.e. decreased reliance on oleate and increased reliance on carbohydrate). The observed decrease in medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase expression is consistent with decreased rates of fatty acid oxidation, whereas the decrease in pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 expression is consistent with increased rates of carbohydrate oxidation. Chronic activation of PPARα completely blocked this substrate switching (and the decreases in medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 expression) in the pressure-overloaded heart, suggesting that decreased PPARα is indeed an essential component for substrate switching. Pressure overload resulted in both an increase in the heart weight/body weight ratio and a reactivation of fetal genes (ANF and skeletal α-actin). It is possible that decreased expression (and DNA binding activity) of the nuclear factor PPARα plays a role in either the trophic or gene expression responses of the heart to pressure overload, either directly (by binding to promoter regions of fetal genes) or indirectly. In the latter case, substrate switching induced by decreased PPARα could alter metabolites in the cell that might potentially affect the activity of various transcription factors. Recent work in our laboratory suggests that glucose metabolites affect MHC isoform gene expression in the heart. 2M. E. Young and H. Taegtmeyer, unpublished observations. Chronic activation of PPARα did not prevent the induction of either the trophic response or the reexpression of ANF in response to pressure overload. However, in the case of skeletal α-actin, the reexpression of this fetal gene was abolished by chronic PPARα activation, suggesting that the gene encoding for this sarcomeric protein is influenced by the level of PPARα DNA binding activity. We hypothesize that substrate switching, as opposed to PPARα directly influencing the skeletal α-actin promoter, plays a role in the induction of this gene. Indeed, Sp1, a known glucose-regulated transcription factor, is essential for the induction of skeletal α-actin expression in the hypertrophied heart (29Karns L. Kariya K. Simpson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 410-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Hypertrophy is an adapted state, enabling the heart to maintain cardiac output in the face of pressure overload. Whether adaptation at all levels (trophic, gene expression, and metabolic levels) is essential for maintenance of cardiac function is unknown. By reactivating PPARα in the hypertrophied heart and thereby blocking substrate switching, we were able to show that the metabolic adaptation is essential. We chose to investigate cardiac function ex vivo (in the isolated working heart preparation) rather than in vivo (use of echocardiogram, for example) so that external influences, such as fuel and neurohumoral factors, are constant for all hearts. For example, WY-14,643 has been shown previously to have a lipid-lowering effectin vivo, which would then influence fuel availability for the heart (30Lazarow P.B. Science. 1977; 197: 580-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The results show that neither pressure overload nor WY-14,643 treatment alone has any significant effects on cardiac power or efficiency. However, when PPARα is reactivated in the hypertrophied heart, both cardiac power and efficiency decrease dramatically. Thus, down-regulation of PPARα is essential for the maintenance of cardiac output by the hypertrophied heart. The hypertrophied heart is less able to adapt to subsequent changes in its environment. For example, the hypertrophied heart is more susceptible to reperfusion damage after an ischemic insult (31Anderson P.G. Allard M.F. Thomas G.D. Bishop S.P. Digerness S.B. Circ. Res. 1990; 67: 948-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In addition, the accumulative stress of diabetes on the hypertrophied heart leads to heart failure (32Factor S.M. Bhan R. Minase T. Wolinsky H. Sonnenblick E.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1981; 102: 219-228PubMed Google Scholar). In diabetes, plasma fatty acids are elevated, which are able to activate PPARα. It is therefore possible that increased PPARα activity in the hypertrophied heart within the diabetic milieu results in cardiac dysfunction, similar to that observed in the present study. This may explain the reported contractile dysfunction in the obese Zucker rat heart, a hypertrophic heart within a diabetic milieu (33Zhou Y. Grayburn P. Karim A. Shimabukuro M. Higa M. Baetens D. Orci L. Unger R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1784-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 34Paulson D.J. Tahiliani A.G. Life Sci. 1992; 51: 1557-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Hypertrophy precedes heart failure. The factors involved in the transition from hypertrophy to heart failure are not known. Because the failing heart has been described as energy-starved (35Katz A. Cardiol. Clin. 1998; 16: 633-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), much work from our laboratory has focused on alterations in metabolic control in both the hypertrophied and the failing heart. The present study suggests that substrate switching may be essential for the maintenance of cardiac output. We have recently found that in addition to decreased fatty acid metabolic gene expression, the failing human heart possesses decreased expression of both glucose transporters 1 and 4. 3P. Razeghi, M. E. Young, and H. Taegtmeyer, unpublished observation. Because increased glucose oxidation is essential for cardiac function in the face of pressure overload, decreased glucose transport in the cardiomyocyte may play a role in contractile dysfunction in the failing human heart. The present study has shown that reactivation of PPARα in the hypertrophied heart prevents substrate switching, with a concomitant depression of contractile function. We speculate that the prevention of substrate switching causes the contractile function in the face of pressure overload. However, the present study cannot rule out the possibility that these two observations are independent and that the depression of cardiac performance was due to an additional effect of PPARα reactivation. For example, the induction of skeletal α-actin may be essential for contractile function, or the induction of additional PPARα-regulated genes that were not investigated in the present study may play a role in the observed contractile dysfunction. One such candidate is UCP3, which we have recently shown to be controlled by PPARα in the heart. When induced, UCP3 could potentially reduce mitochondrial ATP synthesis and therefore affect contractile function. Reactivation of PPARα in the hypertrophied heart had no effect on the trophic response or the induction of ANF in response to pressure overload. In contrast, PPARα reactivation abolished skeletal α-actin induction, prevented substrate switching in the hypertrophied heart, and resulted in severe impairment of cardiac function. The results suggest that down-regulation of PPARα is essential for substrate switching and maintenance of cardiac function of the hypertrophied heart."

The α-subunits of the hypoxia-inducible factors have been identified as targets for the VCB-Cul2 ubiquitin ligase. However, a variety of cellular defects caused by the depletion of pVHL cannot be explained solely by the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor-α.

The VHL protein (pVHL) has been shown to associate with elongin B, elongin C, Cullin-2 (Cul2), and Rbx1 to form the VCB-Cul2 complex. This complex is structurally analogous to SCF (Skp-1, Cullin-1, F-box protein) ubiquitin-protein ligase (2Pause A. Lee S. Worrell R.A. Chen D.Y.T. Burgess W.H. Linehan W.M. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl.

Ubiquitination is a multistep process that conjugates ubiquitin moieties to internal lysine residues of proteins. Successive conjugation of ubiquitin molecules generates polyubiquitin chains. Polyubiquitinated proteins are then degraded by the 26 S proteasome. Among the molecules involved in ubiquitin conjugation reactions, the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases play a pivotal role in substrate recognition (5Patton E.E. Willems A.R. Tyers M. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 236-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). As a consequence of VHL gene inactivation, the expression level of vascular endothelial growth factor is increased and subsequent stimulation of angiogenesis is observed (1Kaelin W.G. Maher E.R. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 423-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 and -2 (HIF-1, -2) are key transcription factors for the induction of vascular endothelial growth factor gene expression. HIFs are composed of α and β subunits. The activity of HIFs are regulated by the oxygen-dependent degradation of the α subunit of HIF-1 and HIF-2 (HIF-α) via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (6Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.W.

Moreover, the physiological significance of these interactions remains to be elucidated. Atypical PKC comprises two members, PKCλ/ι (PKCι is the human homologue of mouse PKCλ) and PKCζ, that are implicated in signaling through lipid metabolites, including phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphates (PIP3) (18Nishizuka Y.

In mammalian epithelial cells, aPKC forms a complex with ASIP and mPAR-6, mammalian homologues of Caenorhabditis elegans PAR-3 and PAR-6, and localizes at tight junctions, a structural cue of cell polarity (25Suzuki A.

Because modifications of cell polarity and cell-cell contact are fundamental steps in the tumorigenesis of epithelial cells, the interaction of pVHL and aPKC suggests the intriguing possibility that aPKC is a target of VCB-Cul2 for ubiquitination. Our previous finding that aPKC directly binds to the β-domain of pVHL, a target recognition site, further supports this possibility (17Okuda H. Hirai S. Takaki Y. Kamada M. Baba M. Sakai N. Kishida T. Kaneko S. Yao M. Ohno S. Shuin T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To test whether aPKC can be a substrate of VCB-Cul2 ubiquitin ligase, we monitored the ubiquitination of recombinant PKCλ in vivo and in vitro. In experiments using transfected HEK293T cells, we show that pVHL mediates the ubiquitination of the activated form of PKCλ through an interaction with the regulatory domain of PKCλ. By using an in vitro reconstitution system for ubiquitination, we could clearly show that the ubiquitination of PKCλ is mediated by pVHL-containing E3. The expression plasmids were constructed on SRHisB under the SRα promoter. SRHisB-VHLWT (full 1–213), SRHisB-VHL122 (aa 1–122), and SRHisB-VHLΔ87–130 (deletion of aa 87–130) encode the indicated human VHL cDNA downstream of the T7-His tag sequence to produce N-terminal tagged proteins. The expression plasmid for N-terminally HA-tagged ubiquitin was constructed on pcDNA3.1 (kindly provided by Dr. K. Tanaka, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo, Japan). The expression plasmid for N-terminally Myc-tagged Cul2 was also constructed on pcDNA3.1. Expression plasmids SRDwPKCλ (full-length PKCλ), SRDλRD (regulatory domain, aa 1–240, of PKCλ), MLKD (kinase domain, aa 198–586, of PKCλ), and ML4RA (active mutant of PKCλ, aa 48–586 with mutation of arginines 117, 118, 121, and 122 to Ala substitutions) have been described previously (27Akimoto K.

Human embryonic kidney cells, HEK293T, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS). For the activation of wild-type PKCλ, cells were exposed to DMEM containing 0.5% (v/v) FBS for 20 h and then supplemented with 20% (v/v) FBS for the appropriate time period. A mouse fibroblast cell line, NIH3T3, was cultured in DMEM containing 10% (v/v) calf serum. Transfection was performed following a standard calcium phosphate co-precipitation procedure. The amounts of expression vector DNA used were 5 μg for PKCλ, and 1 μg for HA-Ub and Myc-Cul2; an appropriate amount of T7-VHL was selected for each experiment. For the ubiquitination study, cells were treated with 10 μm MG132 for 6 h before harvest. After transfection, cells were cultured for 24 or 48 h for the PKCλ activation experiments, and then harvested. The cells were suspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer composed of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm vanadate, 20 mm NaF, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. After a 20-min incubation on ice, 0.1% cysteine was added and the suspension was incubated on ice for an additional 10 min. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatants were incubated with an anti-PKCλ antibody (28Akimoto K. Mizuno K. Osada S. Hirai S. Tanuma S. Suzuki K. Ohno S. J. Biol.

The immunocomplexes were washed four times with lysis buffer and twice with final wash buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm vanadate, and 20 mm NaF. UbcH5b, Ubc12, and Nedd8 were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli as described previously (4Iwai K. Yamanaka K. Kamura T. Minato N. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Klausner R.D. Pause A. Proc.

Purified or immunoprecipitated PKCλ was incubated together with E1, UbcH5B, ATP regeneration system (0.5 mm ATP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, and 5 μg of creatine phosphokinase), Nedd8 conjugation system (300 ng of APP-BP1-Uba3, 200 ng of Ubc12, and 1 μg of Nedd8), and the indicated amount of VCB-Cul2 complex (see Fig. 6 legend) in the presence or absence of 10 μg of ubiquitin at 37 °C for 2 h. After stopping the reaction by adding 4× SDS sample buffer, the reaction mixtures were electrophoresed on to 6% SDS-PAGE and detected by anti-PKCι/λ antibody (Transduction Laboratories). Cell extracts or immunocomplexes were separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% polyacrylamide gels and transferred electrophoretically to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The blotted membranes were soaked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% skim milk overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were blocked with 1% normal goat serum in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 h, and then incubated with the indicated antibody in TBST containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing with TBST, the membranes were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibody (KPL) and then visualized using an ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Densitometric analysis was performed with Molecular Analyst (Bio-Rad). The antibodies used were: anti-PKCλ (28Akimoto K. Mizuno K. Osada S. Hirai S. Tanuma S. Suzuki K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12677-12683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), anti-PKCι (Transduction Laboratories), anti-HA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), anti-T7 Tag (Novagen), and anti-human VHL (PharMingen). The identification of the VCB-Cul2 complex as an ubiquitin-protein ligase prompted us to examine whether PKCλ is ubiquitinated by the pVHL-containing complex. We transiently expressed PKCλ in HEK293T cells together with T7 epitope-tagged VHL (T7-VHL) and HA-tagged ubiquitin (HA-Ub) and monitored the conjugation of HA-Ub to immunoprecipitated PKCλ. As shown in Fig.1 A, faint smear bands of higher molecular mass were recognized by the anti-HA antibody in the immunoprecipitates from cells transfected with WT PKCλ, indicating that WT PKCλ is ubiquitinated (lane 3). We have observed previously that pVHL binds to the constitutively active PKCλ mutant (PKCλ4RA) more tightly than to wild-type PKCλ (17Okuda H. Hirai S. Takaki Y. Kamada M. Baba M. Sakai N. Kishida T. Kaneko S. Yao M. Ohno S. Shuin T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Therefore, we predicted that this mutant would be ubiquitinated more efficiently by the pVHL-dependent ubiquitination system. In fact, we were able to show relatively clear ubiquitination of PKCλ4RA in HEK293T cells (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). PKCλ interacts directly with pVHL (17Okuda H. Hirai S. Takaki Y. Kamada M. Baba M. Sakai N. Kishida T. Kaneko S. Yao M. Ohno S. Shuin T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and the interaction depends on the N-terminal β-domain of pVHL, which is predicted to be a binding site for proteins targeted by VCB-Cul2 for ubiquitination (29Stebbins C.E. Kaelin W.G. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 284: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Taken together with the results described above, these observations strongly suggest that pVHL recognizes PKCλ for ubiquitination in vivo. To prove this point, we first tested the dose dependence of overexpressed pVHL (T7-VHL) on the ubiquitination of PKCλ4RA by transfecting different amounts of T7-VHL expression vector (Fig. 1 B). As determined by densitometric analysis, the ubiquitination of PKCλ4RA was most prominent when 0.1 μg of T7 expression vector was used (Fig. 1 B, lanes 4–6). It should be noted that the ubiquitination of PKCλ4RA was also observed without the expression of T7-VHL; this may depend on endogenous VHL protein in 293T cells (Fig. 1 B, lane 3). To confirm the contribution of VCB-Cul2 to the ubiquitination of PKCλ, we employed a dominant-negative mutant of pVHL that is predicted to suppress the interaction of wild-type pVHL with PKCλ4RA. For the evaluation of the dominant-negative effect on ubiquitination, we used a C-terminal deleted pVHL (T7-VHL122), which binds to PKCλ but cannot form a VCB complex (17Okuda H. Hirai S. Takaki Y. Kamada M. Baba M. Sakai N. Kishida T. Kaneko S. Yao M. Ohno S. Shuin T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 C, the ubiquitination of PKCλ4RA was greatly diminished by co-expression of T7-VHL122, both in the presence and absence of exogenous pVHL. Although we suspected that activated PKCλ is preferentially ubiquitinated by the pVHL-containing ligase, the efficient ubiquitination of mutant PKCλ by VCB-Cul2 might be because of its abnormal protein structure. To detect the ubiquitination of physiologically activated PKCλ, we monitored the ubiquitination of wild-type PKCλ before and after the serum stimulation of cells, which induces the activation of PKCλ in vivo (30Akimoto K. Takahashi R. Moriya S. Nishioka N. Takayanagi J. Kimura K. Fukui Y. Osada S. Mizuno K. Hirai S. Kazlauskas A. Ohno S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 788-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The amount of ubiquitinated PKCλ increased as early as 5 min after the addition of serum and was sustained for at least 120 min (Fig.2 A). The ubiquitinated PKCλ decreased to the basal level at 360 min after serum stimulation, very similar to the activation of serum-induced activation of aPKCλ in HepG2 cells (30Akimoto K. Takahashi R. Moriya S. Nishioka N. Takayanagi J. Kimura K. Fukui Y. Osada S. Mizuno K. Hirai S. Kazlauskas A. Ohno S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 788-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). These observations strongly support the notion that the active form of PKCλ is preferentially ubiquitinated. To test the contribution of VCB-Cul2 to the ubiquitination of activated PKCλ, we monitored the effect of T7-VHL122, which acts as a dominant-negative mutant of pVHL, on the ubiquitination level. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the ubiquitination of PKCλ in serum-stimulated cells was greatly diminished by co-expression of the T7-VHL122 both in the presence and absence of exogenous pVHL, as had been observed with PKCλ4RA. Taken together, these observations strongly suggest that the ubiquitination of activated PKCλ is mediated by the VCB-Cul2 ubiquitin ligase. The most common physiological significance of ubiquitin conjugation is the marking of proteins to be degraded by the 26 S proteasome (31Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar). To detect the ubiquitin-conjugated PKCλ in the experiments shown above, we added MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, to protect it from degradation (Figs. 1and 2). The ubiquitinated PKCλ was certainly detectable in the presence of MG132, and was more prominent in cells overexpressing pVHL (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, ubiquitin-conjugated PKCλ was hardly detectable in the absence of the proteasome inhibitor (Fig. 3,lanes 1 and 2). As shown in the middle panel of Fig. 3, the total amount of immunoprecipitated PKCλ did not change significantly in the presence or absence of the proteasome inhibitor. This indicates that only a small fraction of the PKCλ activated by serum stimulation is targeted for ubiquitination and degradation by proteasomes. These observations support the notion that activated PKCλ is eliminated by the ubiquitin-proteasome protein degradation system. We formerly reported that pVHL binds to the regulatory domain of aPKC (17Okuda H. Hirai S. Takaki Y. Kamada M. Baba M. Sakai N. Kishida T. Kaneko S. Yao M. Ohno S. Shuin T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To explore whether the regulatory domain is also required for the ubiquitination of PKCλ, we examined the conjugation of HA-tagged ubiquitin to wild-type PKCλ, the regulatory domain of PKCλ (aa 1–242), or the kinase domain of PKCλ (aa 191–586), in HEK293T cells. Because the cells were not stimulated by serum in this experiment, ubiquitination of the wild-type PKCλ was rather limited even in the cells expressing exogenous pVHL, whereas a relatively high level of ubiquitination was observed when only the regulatory domain was present (Fig. 4, lanes 1–4). On the other hand, no ubiquitination was observed with the kinase domain alone, as expected from its inability to bind to pVHL (Fig. 4, lanes 5 and 6). These results indicate that the regulatory domain is necessary and sufficient for ubiquitination as well as for pVHL interaction. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the kinase domain of wild-type PKCλ also contains ubiquitin conjugation sites. As shown in Figs. 1 C and2 B, an excess amount of pVHL lacking the C-terminal α-domain shows a strong dominant-negative effect on the ubiquitination of PKCλ, indicating that VCB-Cul2 complex formation is required for the ubiquitination of PKCλ. We wished to verify that the N-terminal β-domain as well as the C-terminal α-domain of pVHL is required for the ubiquitination of PKCλ. To this end, we expressed the VHLΔ87–130 mutant bearing a deletion of amino acids 87–130 (including a large part of the β-domain), as well as wild-type pVHL or the VHL122 mutant bearing a deletion of the C-terminal 91 amino acids (including the α-domain) in HEK293T cells, and the ubiquitination of PKCλ was examined in these cells after serum stimulation. PKCλ ubiquitination was obvious in cells expressing wild-type pVHL (Fig. 5, lane 1), as already shown in Fig. 2. In contrast, the ubiquitination of PKCλ was quite limited in cells expressing VHLΔ87–130 or VHL122 (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 3), and was much weaker than that in cells without the overexpression of the VHL mutants (data not shown), suggesting a dominant-negative effect of the mutants. Considering that VHLΔ87–130 and VHL122 can bind to elongin C and PKCλ, respectively (17Okuda H. Hirai S. Takaki Y. Kamada M. Baba M. Sakai N. Kishida T. Kaneko S. Yao M. Ohno S. Shuin T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), these results indicate that the formation of the VCB-Cul2 enzymatic complex is definitely required for the ubiquitination of PKCλ. Results from in vivo studies strongly suggest that VCB-Cul2 ubiquitin ligase can recognize and ubiquitinate PKCλ. However, direct evidence that the VCB-Cul2 complex acts as a ubiquitin ligase for PKCλ is still missing. Therefore, an in vitro ubiquitination assay for PKCλ was established using purified components. All the recombinant components for the ubiquitination of PKCλ were either expressed in E. coli or baculovirally expressed in insect cells and purified as shown in Fig.6 A, followed by testing for ubiquitination of PKCλ by VCB-Cul2 in vitro. As shown in Fig. 6 B, a mobility shift of PKCλ was observed in a ubiquitin- and VCB-Cul2-dependent manner. That ubiquitin was conjugated to the mobility-shifted PKCλ was demonstrated by Western blot analysis using an anti-ubiquitin antibody (data not shown). Because ubiquitination of baculovirally expressed PKCλ might be because of the presence of malfolded proteins caused by the overexpression, we next examined whether endogenous PKCλ is ubiquitinated by VCB-Cul2 in vitro. As shown in Fig.6 C, the endogenous PKCλ immunoprecipitated from NIH3T3 cells is indeed ubiquitinated by VCB-Cul2, and it is not ubiquitinated in the absence of E2, ATP, or VCB-Cul2, suggesting that endogenous PKCλ is the substrate of VCB-Cul2 for ubiquitination. The ability of the VCB complex to ubiquitinate PKCλ in vitro strongly suggests that pVHL contributes to the regulation of aPKC activity in vivo by inducing ubiquitination and consequent proteolysis. In this report, we showed that pVHL mediates ubiquitination of PKCλ in vitro and in vivo and that the activated form of PKCλ is preferentially targeted for ubiquitination. We also showed that both the α-domain and β-domain of pVHL are required for the VCB complex to function as a ubiquitin ligase for PKCλ. These results replicate the results of our previous binding study of pVHL and aPKC (17Okuda H. Hirai S. Takaki Y. Kamada M. Baba M. Sakai N. Kishida T. Kaneko S. Yao M. Ohno S. Shuin T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), which showed that aPKC directly associates with the β-domain of pVHL, and that this interaction occurs preferentially with the active form of aPKC. From these results, we propose that the VCB complex is responsible for the down-regulation of activated aPKC via the ubiquitin-proteolytic pathway, which terminates aPKC-mediated cellular signaling. The activity of the atypical types of PKC isozymes, including PKCζ and -λ, is induced by an interaction with PIP3, a lipid derivative produced by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (32Nakanishi H. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or by phosphorylation of a threonine residue catalyzed by PDK1 (33Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). The activated enzymes may be rapidly down-regulated to terminate unnecessary PKC activity in cells. Proteolysis is a common mechanism of down-regulation reported for both conventional and novel PKC isozymes (cPKC and nPKC). The ubiquitination and the degradation of cPKCα and nPKCδ and -ε has been reported to be triggered by the induction of their activation by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate treatment of cells (34Lu Z. Liu D. Hornia A. Devonish W. Pagano M. Foster D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 839-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). However, the ubiquitin ligase which is responsible for the ubiquitination of c/nPKC has not been identified. As for aPKC, this is the first report dealing with the down-regulation of the activated enzyme and the identification of the VCB-Cul2 complex as an active aPKC-specific ubiquitin ligase. Ubiquitination and degradation of proteins often depend on post-translational modifications. Target proteins for the SCF complex-type ubiquitin ligases, such as β-catenin, p27kip, and IκB, are recognized by F-box proteins only when phosphorylated at defined amino acid residues (35Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar,36Carrano A.C. Eytan E. Hershko A. Pagano M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). This molecular mechanism allows phosphorylation-dependent quick degradation of proteins, which plays crucial roles in the regulation of the cell cycle, growth, and differentiation. Degradation of HIF-α, a target of VCB-Cul2 ubiquitin ligase, depends on oxygen, and the degradation is blocked under hypoxic conditions (6Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4298-4309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies revealed that the hydroxylation of a proline residue located in the oxygen-dependent degradation domain is essential for the binding to pVHL (37Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H. Kim W. Valiando J. Ohh M. Salic A. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Kaelin W.G. Science. 2001; 292: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (3783) Google Scholar, 38Jaakkola P. Mole D.R. Tian Y.M. Wilson M.I. Gielbert J.

Then how does pVHL recognize active PKCλ? Protein kinases of the PKC family consist of a regulatory domain and a kinase domain, and the regulatory domain contains a cysteine-rich lipid binding region and a pseudosubstrate region. In nonactivated PKC, the pseudosubstrate region is predicted to interact with the kinase domain, and this intramolecular interaction may inhibit the kinase activity. It is supposed that the binding of a certain second messenger, such as PIP3, to the regulatory domain may lead to the dissociation of the pseudosubstrate region from the kinase domain and to the interaction with substrate molecules. This process involves a conformational change of the aPKC molecule; during this change, a specific region of regulatory domain that faces the inside of the molecule in the inactive form might be exposed to the outer environment. We showed that the free regulatory domain binds to pVHL in the absence of the kinase domain (17Okuda H. Hirai S. Takaki Y. Kamada M. Baba M. Sakai N. Kishida T. Kaneko S. Yao M. Ohno S. Shuin T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and is ubiquitinated in vivo (Fig. 4). Neither the interaction of pVHL nor the ubiquitination was observed with kinase domains from which the regulatory domains have been removed (17Okuda H. Hirai S. Takaki Y. Kamada M. Baba M. Sakai N. Kishida T. Kaneko S. Yao M. Ohno S. Shuin T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). These observations support the idea that pVHL specifically recognizes a part of the regulatory domain that is masked in inactive aPKC. This allows the selective recruitment of the activated form of aPKC into the degradation pathway. Although several lines of evidence have shown that the aPKC isotypes, PKCζ and PKCλ, play fundamental roles in cellular events such as proliferation (19Berra E. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Frutos S. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4346-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and survival (20Diaz-Meco M.T. Municio M.M. Frutos S. Sanchez P. Lozano J. Sanz L. Moscat J. Cell. 1996; 86: 777-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), any influence of an aPKC signal transduction disorder on tumor development is rather unclear. Recent studies have elucidated the important role of aPKC in the establishment or maintenance of cell polarity (21Izumi Y. Hirose T. Tamai Y. Hirai S. Nagashima Y. Fujimoto T. Tabuse Y. Kemphues K.J. Ohno S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 22Joberty G. Petersen C. Gao L. Macara I.G. Nat.

Atypical PKC forms a complex with ASIP and mPAR-6, and the complex localizes in tight junctions in epithelial cells. Activated small G-proteins, Cdc42/Rac1, also interact with this protein complex through mPAR-6, which modifies actin cytoskeleton structures and cell polarity. Therefore, one can predict that aPKC influences cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion and actin filament organization in epithelial cells through this protein complex. In fact, the contribution of aPKC to the formation of tight junction and actin filament organization has been reported (25Suzuki A. Yamanaka T. Hirose T. Manabe N. Mizuno K. Shimizu M. Akimoto K. Izumi Y. Ohnishi T. Ohno S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1183-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 39Coghlan M.P. Chou M.M. Carpenter C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2880-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). It should be noted that pVHL has also been shown to be involved in such cellular events. Ectopic expression of pVHL in VHL-deficient renal cell carcinoma cells induces the formation of focal adhesions and stress fibers, which reduce cell motility (13Kamada M. Suzuki K. Kato Y. Okuda H. Shuin T. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4184-4189PubMed Google Scholar). pVHL is also involved in the establishment and maintenance of contact inhibition of cell growth (12Baba M. Hirai S. Kawakami S. Kishida T. Sakai N. Kaneko S. Yao M. Shuin T. Kubota Y. Hosaka M. Ohno S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2727-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations support the idea that some of pVHL's functions as a tumor suppressor are attained at least in part by the control of aPKC activity. Given the preferential pVHL interaction and ubiquitination/degradation of the active form aPKC, one can predict that the loss of pVHL function leads to the endurance of activated aPKC, which may cause disorders in cytoskeletal organization and cell-substrate and cell-cell interaction as are commonly observed in tumorigenic cells. When we compared the steady-state level of aPKC between VHL-deficient renal cell carcinoma cells and their derivatives with an introduced ectopic VHL gene, no significant difference was observed (data not shown). This observation is in apparent contradiction to the prediction that pVHL plays an important role in the degradation of aPKC. However, because the inactive form of aPKC, a main component of the cellular aPKC protein, is expected to be resistant to the pVHL-driven degradation pathway, the steady-state protein level of aPKC is predicted to be independent of the protein level of pVHL. The activation may occur in a small fraction of the aPKC pool, and this restricted activation allows the activation of second and third fractions of aPKC soon after the activation and degradation of the first fraction. pVHL may involved in such quick and repeatable on/off control of the aPKC activity, and a disorder of this switching system may result in tumorigenesis of epithelial cells. We sincerely thank Dr. Keiji Tanaka for help with the ubiquitin expression system."

In this report we show that stimulation with interleukin-4 induces μ-opioid receptor transcripts in human primary blood cells (T cells and polymorphonuclear leukocytes), immune cell lines (Raji, U-937, and HMEC-1), and dendritic cells. In nonstimulated immune cells this gene is silent. In addition, μ receptor transcription is up-regulated by interleukin-4 in cultures of primary rat neurons. Transient transfection experiments in Raji and SH SY5Y neuronal cells with human and rat reporter gene constructs linked the interleukin-4 effect directly to cis-active μ receptor promoter elements located at nucleotide −997 on the human gene and nucleotide −727 on the rat gene. The interleukin-4 response elements function orientation independently. They bind STAT6 transcription factors as shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. In the human gene, a single nucleotide polymorphism within the interleukin-4 response element reduces the trans-activating potential of this element by 50%, which may affect the phenotype of persons carrying this variation.

The effects of opioids are mediated by at least three different opioid receptors, termed μ, δ, and κ, which belong to the G-protein-coupled membrane receptor family (1Reisine T. Brownstein M.J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1994; 4: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 2Kieffer B.L. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1995; 15: 615-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). During the last years, evidence has accumulated showing that exogenous opiates like morphine and endogenous opioid peptides derived from the precursors proopiomelanocortin, proenkephalin, and prodynorphin have multiple immunomodulatory properties in addition to their classical functions as neuromodulators. It was stated that the endogenous opioid peptides would now be considered members of the cytokine family if they had been first discovered by immunologists (3Peterson P.K. Molitor T.W. Chao C.C. J. Neuroimmunol. 1998; 83: 63-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Elucidation of a broad bidirectional communication between the opioid system and the immune system strengthens this concept. Thus, morphine, the prototypical exogenous ligand for the μ receptor, is an immunosuppressive drug and is responsible for increased susceptibility of opioid addicts to infections (4Lefkowitz S.S. Chiang C.Y. Life Sci. 1975; 17: 1763-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 5Rouveix B. Therapie. 1992; 47: 503-512PubMed Google Scholar, 6Bencsics A. Elenkov I.J. Vizi E.S. J.

Neuroimmunol. 1999; 95: 107-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Studies with μ-opioid receptor knockout mice emphasized the role of this receptor in immunosuppression (9Gaveriaux-Ruff C. Matthes H.W. Peluso J. Kieffer B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6326-6330Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). After chronic morphine treatment, these mice developed none of the symptoms characteristic of wild type mice, namely lymphoid organ atrophy, diminished CD4+/CD8+ cell ratio and strongly reduced natural killer cell activity. In contrast, cytokines modulate the expression of opioid peptide genes and opioid receptor genes. For example, studies with IL-61 knockout mice revealed decreased levels of μ receptors in the brain compared with wild type animals, suggesting a positive regulation of this receptor by IL-6 in vivo (10Bianchi M. Maggi R. Pimpinelli F. Rubino T. Parolaro D. Poli V. Ciliberto G. Panerai A.E. Sacerdote P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In vitro, up-regulation of μ receptors was observed after IL-1 stimulation in primary astrocyte-enriched cultures derived from various brain regions (11Ruzicka B.B. Thompson R.C. Watson S.J. Akil H. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 425-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 12Ruzicka B.B. Akil H. Neuroscience. 1997; 79: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and in neural microvascular endothelial cells (13Vidal E.L. Patel N.A. Wu G. Fiala M. Chang S.L. Immunopharmacology. 1998; 38: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In promoter studies, however, a direct activation of μ receptor transcription by IL-1 and IL-6 could not be demonstrated (14Im H.J. Kang S.W. Loh H.H. Brain Res. 1999; 829: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The opioid peptide β-endorphin is derived from proopiomelanocortin and is a physiological endogenous ligand of the μ receptor. A close relationship was demonstrated between morphine and β-endorphin on the one hand and T cell regulation on the other. Thus, immunological effects of β-endorphin are exerted via activation of IL-4, the prototypical Th2 cytokine (15van den Bergh P. Rozing J. Nagelkerken L. Cell. Immunol. 1993; 149: 180-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 16van den Bergh P. Rozing J. Nagelkerken L. Lymphokine Cytokine Res. 1994; 13: 63-69PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, morphine as well as β-endorphin were shown to induce a shift from a Th1-type to Th2-type cytokine pattern (8Roy S. Charboneau R.G. Barke R.A. J. Neuroimmunol. 1999; 95: 107-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 17Sacerdote P. di San Secondo V.E. Sirchia G. Manfredi B. Panerai A.E. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1998; 113: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In contrast, blocking of β-endorphin by antibodies or blocking of μ-opioid receptors by the highly specific μ receptor antagonist naloxone resulted in a shift from a Th2-type to Th1-type cytokine pattern (18Sacerdote P. Bianchi M. Panerai A.E. Regul. Pept. 1996; 63: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 19Sacerdote P. Manfredi B. Gaspani L. Panerai A.E. Blood. 2000; 95: 2031-2036Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Considering the apparent involvement of μ-opioid receptors in immunosuppression and immunomodulation, the multiple regulatory interactions between cytokines (in particular Th2 cytokines), and the μ-opioid system, we addressed the question of whether IL-4 may regulate expression of the μ-opioid receptor gene and investigated the molecular mechanisms of this regulation. SH SY5Y and HEK 293 cells were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (PAA Laboratories, Linz, Austria) supplemented with 15% FCS (PAA Laboratories) and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin).

On the 9th day of differentiation FACS® analysis was performed with FACscalibur (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany). Cells were double stained with phycoerythrin-labeled CD14 and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled CD83 antibodies (Becton Dickinson) and checked for expression of CD83 (>80%) versus CD14 (<10%). Fetal cortical neurons were prepared as described previously (24Schousboe A. Drejer J. Hansen G.H. Meier E. Dev. Neurosci. 1985; 7: 252-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. In brief, 18–19-day-old fetal rats were removed from the uterus followed by immediate preparation of their brains. The cerebral cortices were dissected and transferred to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The tissue was disassembled into single neurons using a syringe equipped with a 21-gauge 1.5-inch needle. The cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and plated in six-well tissue dishes coated with Matrigel (Becton Dickinson). The cells were kept for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FCS. The cells were further cultivated for 4 days in Start V medium (Biochrom) without FCS, then stimulated, and harvested for RNA extraction. Twenty-four hours prior to cytokine stimulation all cells including controls were given fresh medium with only 1% FCS to minimize interference with substances present in the serum. In all experiments, recombinant human IL-4 (R&D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany) was used in a final concentration of 5 ng/ml, which equals ∼150 World Health Organization units/ml for stimulation of human cells, except for differentiation of dendritic cells (see text for different concentrations). Rat cell cultures were stimulated with 5 ng/ml recombinant rat IL-4 (R&D Systems). Stock solutions of 5 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.5% bovine serum albumin were kept at −20 °C in frozen aliquots to avoid repeated freezing and thawing. Human recombinant GM-CSF was purchased from R&D Systems. Total RNAs from immune cells were extracted using RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and then checked for accidental degradation on an agarose gel. Two micrograms of total RNA were used for cDNA synthesis with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, RNase H minus (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) and diluted to 100 μl. To check the relative amount and the integrity 2–4 μl of cDNA were used to amplify an 842-base pair fragment of the human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (forward primer 5′-CAACTACATGGTTTACATGTTC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TGACAACGAATTTGGCTACAG-3′) under the following conditions: 25 cycles with 40 s at 94 °C, 60 s at 60 °C, and 180 s at 72 °C. Two consecutive amplification steps were performed to amplify μ-opioid receptor transcripts: a first PCR with 2–5 μl of cDNA (adjusted amounts that gave similar intense bands in a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase PCR) in a 30-μl volume with the forward primer 5′-CTTGGCGTACTCAAGTTGCT-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-AATGTGAATGGGAGTCCAGC-3′ for 25 cycles of 40 s at 94 °C, 60 s at 63 °C, and 90 s at 72 °C with an initial denaturation step (150 s at 94 °C) and a final prolongation step (120 s at 72 °C). Five microliters of the first reaction were used for a second PCR in a 30-μl volume with the forward primer 5′-GATCATGGCCCTCTACTCCA-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GCATTTCGGGGAGTACGGAA-3′ for 30 cycles of 40 s at 94 °C, 60 s at 65 °C, and 90 s at 72 °C with an initial denaturation step (150 s at 94 °C) and a final prolongation step (120 s at 72 °C). In both reactions the forward and reverse primers are located on different exons to ascertain that no genomic DNA amplification may mask the cDNA-specific amplificate. Five microliters of the second PCR were electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel. Total RNA was extracted from primary neurons using TRI-Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) following the instructions of the manufacturer. The RNA was checked on an ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel for integrity and to ensure equal amounts per sample. Four micrograms of each RNA sample were subjected to reverse transcription using TrueScript Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Hybaid, Heidelberg, Germany) in a total volume of 20 μl. After incubation at 42 °C for 1 h the reaction mixture was diluted to 100 μl, and 2 μl were included in the PCR (Light Cycler-Fast Start DNA Master SYBR Green I kit, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in a total volume of 20 μl. The primers used to detect rat μ-opioid receptor transcript were 5′-CATTACCATCATGGCCCTCTACTCTATCG-3′ and 5′-ACTGGGTGGCAGACAGCAATGTAGC-3′ yielding an amplified product of 315 base pairs. The primers spanned an intron to avoid amplification of genomic DNA. The reaction was run in a Light Cycler PCR machine (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with a hot start preincubation step of 10 min at 95 °C for 50 cycles consisting of denaturation (15 s at 95 °C) and annealing/elongation (30 s at 72 °C). To obtain a standard curve, the stimulated samples were pooled and serially diluted. The amount of template was quantified using the second derivative maximum method as included in the Light Cycler software package. All reporter plasmids are based on the pBLCAT2/pBLCAT3 vector system (25Luckow B. Schütz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). The series of rat μ promoter reporter plasmids has been used and described previously (26Kraus J. Horn G. Zimprich A. Simon T. Mayer P. Höllt V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For construction of plasmid prMOR−1660Δ−851/−449 the basic −1660 construct was opened with SpeI (nt −617) and digested with Bal31. The enzyme was inactivated for 20 min at 80 °C, and the ends were blunted with Klenow enzyme and religated. This and all other plasmids used here were sequenced, if possible from both sides, to ensure correct cloning procedures and for determination of the extent of Bal31 digests. The basic human μ promoter reporter plasmid (phMOR−2229) was constructed as follows. Starting from previously cloned sequences (27Wendel B. Hoehe M.R. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) a SauI-BlpI fragment spanning from nt −2229 to nt −165 containing the prominent transcription initiation sites was inserted into the BamHI and BglII sites of the vector pBLCAT2 (25Luckow B. Schütz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). Simultaneously the HSV tk promoter located between these vector sites was excised. Construct phMOR−1372 was generated by cutting the basic construct with BglII (nt −1372) and HindIII (vector), filling the ends, and religating. Construct phMOR−779 was obtained by a 5′-deletion method using DNase as described previously (28Lin H.C. Lei S.P. Wilcox G. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 147: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Constructs phMOR−2229Δ−1854/−1372 and phMOR−2229Δ−1372/−254 were generated by cutting out fragments using the restriction enzymes AccI (nt −1854) and BglII and PstI (nt −254), blunting, and ligating. The internal deletions in the plasmids phMOR−2229Δ−1933/−1033 and phMOR−1372Δ−1001/−950 were made with enzyme Bal31 after opening the plasmids with BglII and NdeI (nt −985), respectively. Oligonucleotides with IL-4-responsive regions were inserted in pBLCAT2 in front of the HSV tk promoter into the XbaI (human constructs) or SphI (rat construct) sites of the vector. The sequences of the inserted human −997 wild type, human −997 polymorphic, and rat −727 oligonucleotides are given in this section under “Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay” since the same double-stranded oligonucleotides were used. The plasmid DNA used for transfection was isolated using Qiagen plasmid kits (Qiagen). Before transfection, all cells received fresh medium with 1% FCS. Transfection of SH SY5Y cells and the reporter gene assay have been described earlier (26Kraus J. Horn G. Zimprich A. Simon T. Mayer P. Höllt V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 29Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). The same method was applied to transfect HMEC-1 and HEK 293 cells. Raji and U-937 cells were transfected as follows. Cells (5 × 106) were pelleted, resuspended in 5 ml of medium, and transfected by dropwise addition of 10 μg of plasmid DNA in 500 μl of a buffer containing 140 mm NaCl, 25 mm Hepes, and 0.5 mmNa2HPO4 (pH 7.05). After a 17-h incubation at 3% CO2 and 35 °C, cells were pelleted again and given fresh medium. After transfection, all cells were allowed to grow for a further 48 h in a 1% FCS medium containing IL-4 or vehicle prior to the CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Twenty-four hours prior to nuclear protein extraction SH SY5Y cells received fresh medium containing 1% FCS. Stimulation with 5 ng/ml IL-4 was for 1 h prior to nuclear protein extraction. The extraction procedure for nuclear proteins used in the electrophoretic mobility shift assays has been described in detail in a recent publication (30Wöltje M. Kraus J. Höllt V. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides (Metabion, Martinsried, Germany) carrying putative STAT6 binding sites of μ-opioid receptor promoters and the IL-4 response element of the immunoglobulin heavy chain germline ε promoter (“classic STAT6”) (31Delphin S. Stavnezer J. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to standard methods (32Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 10.17-10.19Google Scholar). For each band shift reaction 5000 cpm of labeled probe were incubated with 3 μl of SH SY5Y cell nuclear extract for 15 min at room temperature in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 0.1 μg of poly(dIdC) DNA. Some reactions contained additionally various amounts of competitor DNA. For immunoshift experiments 4 μg of STAT6 antibody (M-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) were added after the reaction and incubated for a further 60 min. Samples were loaded onto 6% high ionic strength polyacrylamide gels with the Tris-glycine buffer system and separated electrophoretically. The gels were then dried, exposed to BAS1000 imaging plates, and analyzed by the BAS1000 phosphorimaging program. Sequences of the oligonucleotides were as follows: AP-2 motif used as unspecific competitor, 5′-TGCGGGCTCCCCGGGCTTGGGCGAGC-3′; classic STAT6, 5′-TAGTCAACTTCCCAAGAACAGAATCA-3′; human −997 motif (wild type), 5′-CAACCTTCTTCTCAGAAGCATATGT-3′; human −997 motif (polymorphism), 5′-CAACCTTCTTATCAGAAGCATATGT-3′; rat −727 motif, 5′-TGTTTCCTTTCCAGAGAAAGACCATT-3′. For statistical evaluation of the transfection experiments Student’s t tests were performed. Stars indicate significantly different values (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001). For a first set of experiments (Fig.1 A) primary human T cells and polymorphonuclear leukocytes and, in addition, the human cell lines Raji (B cells), U937 (monocytes), and HMEC-1 (microvascular endothelial cells) were used to study the effect of IL-4 on the expression of μ-opioid receptors in various immune effector cells. The human neuronal cell line SH SY5Y (neuroblastoma), which is known to express μ-opioid receptors constitutively (33Zadina J.E. Chang S.L. Ge L.J. Kastin A.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1993; 265: 254-262PubMed Google Scholar), served as positive control (Fig. 1A, lane 11). No transcripts of μ-opioid receptors could be detected in any of the unstimulated immune cells (Fig. 1A, lanes 1, 3, 5,7, and 9). The highly sensitive nested PCR technique, which was used for these experiments, allowed us to detect as few as five copies of μ-opioid receptor sequences (data not shown), suggesting that in unstimulated immune cells virtually no μ-opioid receptor expression occurs. When the immune cells were stimulated with 5 ng/ml IL-4 for 24 h, μ-opioid receptor transcription was strongly induced in all cells tested (Fig. 1A, lanes 2, 4, 6,8, and 10). In a second set of experiments μ-opioid receptor transcription was determined in monocytes and dendritic cells (Fig. 1 B). Peripheral monocytes were differentiated into dendritic cells with GM-CSF and IL-4 according to described methods (21Romani N. Reider D. Heuer M. Ebner S. Kampgen E. Eibl B. Niederwieser D. Schuler G. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 196: 137-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar, 22Gunzer M. Schafer A. Borgmann S. Grabbe S. Zanker K.S. Brocker E.B. Kampgen E. Friedl P. Immunity. 2000; 13: 323-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). After 9 days of differentiation, the cells were morphologically mature dendritic cells with typical filopodia. FACS® analysis during maturation revealed a reduction of CD14 expression (monocyte marker) paralleled by an induction of CD83 expression (dendritic cell marker). μ-Opioid receptor transcripts were detected neither in undifferentiated monocytes (Fig. 1 B, lane 1), nor in cells during maturation (i.e. after 4 days of incubation with IL-4/GM-CSF, lane 2), nor in the CD83+cells (i.e. 9 days with IL-4/GM-CSF, lane 5). This was unexpected since incubation of other immune cells with IL-4 persistently induced μ-opioid receptor transcription (Fig.1 A). However, when monocytes were incubated with IL-4 alone, μ-opioid receptor transcripts were detected (Fig. 1 B,lane 3). When CD83+ dendritic cells from day 9 were further incubated for 24 h exclusively with IL-4 (i.e. after removing the GM-CSF-containing medium) μ-opioid receptor transcription was also induced (Fig. 1 B,lane 6). These experiments indicate that GM-CSF inhibits μ-opioid receptor transcription induced by IL-4. Cultures of primary cortical fetal neurons from rats were used to investigate whether IL-4 also had a regulatory effect on μ-opioid receptor transcription in cells of neuronal origin (Fig.2). In contrast to immune cells, μ receptor transcripts were already present in the neuronal cells under basal condition. Therefore, to determine quantitative changes in levels of μ-opioid receptor transcripts and the time course of induction by IL-4, the “real-time PCR” technique was used. This technique makes it possible to monitor the onset of the exponential phase of amplification during the PCR run. The earlier this amplification phase begins, the more template is present in the reaction. The experiments showed that IL-4 induced a transient increase in μ-opioid receptor transcription in the neuronal cells. About 2.7-fold increased levels of μ receptor transcripts were observed already after 30 min of IL-4 incubation. This peak was followed by decreasing levels of μ-opioid receptor transcripts, which dropped to control levels again when cells were incubated for 4 h with IL-4. Transient transfection experiments with μ promoter-reporter gene constructs were performed in various cell lines to test whether IL-4 regulates μ-opioid receptor gene expression at the level of transcription initiation (Fig.3). Plasmid pBLCAT2 (25Luckow B. Schütz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar), which was used as a construction vector containing the HSV tk promoter instead of μ receptor promoters, showed no significant inducibility with IL-4 in all of the cells tested (Fig. 3 C). A basic construct with human upstream μ-opioid receptor promoter sequences contained the region spanning from nt −2229 to −165 (with respect to the first translated codon; construct phMOR−2229) in front of the CAT reporter gene. A basic construct with the rat promoter included 5′-upstream sequences up to nt −1660 (construct prMOR−1660). Stimulation of transfected cells with IL-4 (5 ng/ml) significantly elevated CAT activities for both the human (Fig. 3 A) and the rat (Fig. 3 B) promoter constructs in Raji, U-937, and HMEC-1 cells ∼3–4-fold. A similar induction of μ receptor transcription was observed in neuronal SH SY5Y cells. In contrast, no induction after IL-4 treatment of transfected cells was found in HEK 293 cells. The latter cells are known to lack STAT6 transcription factors but contain other IL-4 signaling components (34Mikita T. Campbell D. Wu P. Williamson K. Schindler U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5811-5820Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Unraveling the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation by cytokines, it was found that interleukins, interferons, and growth factors induce the Janus tyrosine kinase/STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) signal transduction pathway (35Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar, 36Horvath C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 496-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). All STAT transcription factor family members bind to very similar cis-active elements on target gene promoters with the palindromic binding motif 5′-TTCn2–4GAA-3′ (37Decker T. Kovarik P. Meinke A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1997; 17: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). IL-4-regulated gene expression of target genes is transduced typically via STAT6 (37Decker T. Kovarik P. Meinke A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1997; 17: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 38Hou J. Schindler U. Henzel W.J. Ho T.C. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L.

Hamilton T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38095-38103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The results obtained in HEK 293 cells thus suggest contribution of STAT6 to IL-4-mediated regulation of the μ-opioid receptor gene. Raji and SH SY5Y cells were used for further transfection experiments with deletion constructs containing various lengths of 5′-flanking regions of the μ-opioid receptor promoters to localize promoter elements required for IL-4 inducibility. The conclusions that can be drawn from the experiments with respect to IL-4 inducibility are identical for both Raji and SH SY5Y cells. Therefore, in the following text it was not discriminated between the two cell types; however, results for both cells are shown separately in the figures. The humanpromoter contains three motifs of the sequence 5′-TTCn2–4GAA-3′ with three central nucleotides, which may serve as binding sites for the STAT6 transcription factor, located at nt −1583, −1061, and −997 (Fig.4 A). When the longest construct with all putative STAT6 binding motifs (lane 1, construct phMOR−2229) was shortened at its 5′-end deleting the most distal −1583 putative STAT6 motif, IL-4 inducibility was retained (lane 2, construct phMOR−1372). A construct with a further 5′-deletion up to nt −779, in which the remaining two STAT6 motifs also were deleted, showed no stimulation (lane 3, construct phMOR−779). Constructs with internal deletions were made to test which motif(s) mediate IL-4 stimulation of reporter gene expression. As expected from the above results, a construct in which only sequences containing the distal −1583 motif were deleted was still responsive to IL-4 (lane 4, construct phMOR−2229Δ−1854/−1372). A con"
https://openalex.org/W2020159234,"CpG-binding protein is a transcriptional activator that exhibits a unique DNA binding specificity for unmethylated CpG motifs. CpG-binding protein contains a cysteine-rich CXXC domain that is conserved in DNA methyltransferase 1, methyl binding domain protein 1, and human trithorax. In vitro DNA binding assays reveal that CpG-binding protein contains a single DNA binding domain comprised of the CXXC domain and a short carboxyl extension. Specific mutation to alanine of individual conserved cysteine residues within the CXXC domain abolishes DNA binding activity. Denaturation/renaturation experiments in the presence of various metal cations demonstrate that the CXXC domain requires zinc for efficient DNA binding activity. Ligand selection of high affinity binding sites from a pool of degenerate oligonucleotides reveals that CpG-binding protein interacts with a variety of sequences that contains the CpG dinucleotide with a consensus binding site of (A/C)CpG(A/C). Mutation of the CpG motif(s) present within ligand-selected oligonucleotides ablates the interaction with CpG-binding protein, and mutation to thymine of the nucleotides flanking the CpG motifs reduces the affinity of CpG-binding protein. Hence, a CpG motif is necessary and sufficient to comprise a binding site for CpG-binding protein, although the immediate flanking sequence affects binding affinity.

DNA methyltransferase CpG-binding protein electrophoretic mobility shift assay human trithorax methyl binding domain plant homeodomain polymerase chain reaction The CpG dinucleotide represents an important regulatory component of mammalian genomes. The cytosine of this dinucleotide serves as the target for methylation via the action of DNA methyltransferases. Methylated DNA is correlated with transcriptionally inactive genes, whereas actively expressed genes are generally hypomethylated (1Bird A.P. Trends Genet. 1987; 3: 342-347Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (650) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that cytosine methylation represents a defense mechanism to silence parasitic repetitive DNA elements present in mammalian genomes (2Walsh C.P. Bestor T.H. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Methylation patterns inherited from gametes are generally erased during early embryogenesis (morula) followed by a wave of de novo DNA methylation in the blastocyst upon implantation (3Kafri T. Ariel M. Brandeis M. Shemer R. Urven L. McCarrey J. Cedar H. Razin A. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 705-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). The CpG dinucleotide is underrepresented in mammalian genomes (5–10% of expected frequency), presumably because of the propensity of 5-methylcytosine to undergo spontaneous deamination to form thymine. Approximately 50% of human genes are associated with CpG islands (1Bird A.P. Trends Genet. 1987; 3: 342-347Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (650) Google Scholar), which contain the statistically expected frequency of CpG dinucleotides. This may reflect the fact that CpG motifs near widely expressed genes are generally hypomethylated. Cytosine methylation also plays an important role in the process of genomic imprinting, in which paternal and maternal alleles of a gene exhibit distinct patterns of methylation and expression (4Tilghman S.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 185-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), and X-chromosome inactivation, in which one X-chromosome in each cell of a female becomes transcriptionally inactivated during early development (5Pfeifer G.P. Tanguay R.L. Steigerwald S.D. Riggs A.D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1277-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Appropriate cytosine methylation is essential for normal mammalian development. Individual ablation of the DNA methyltransferase genes DNMT1,1 DNMT3a, or DNMT3b leads to a disruption of murine embryonic development (6Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4533) Google Scholar, 7Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3235) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutations in Dnmt3b that are predicted to partially inhibit function are associated with the ICF (immunodeficiency, centromere instability, and facial anomalies) syndrome in humans (8Xu G.-L. Besteor T.H. Bourc'his D. Hsieh C.-L. Tommerup N. Bugge M. Hulten M. Qu X. Russso J.J. Viegas-Pequignot E. Nature. 1999; 402: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Also, mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding protein MeCP2 lead to Rett's syndrome, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder (9Amir R.E. Van den Veyver I.B. Wan M. Tran C.Q. Francke U. Zoghbi H.Y. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (3827) Google Scholar). Finally, hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes is commonly observed in human cancer (10Baylin S.B. Herman J.G. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 168-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1403) Google Scholar). A number of DNA binding factors have been reported that bind to methylated CpG motifs and function as transcriptional repressors (11Hendrich B. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6538-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). These include MeCP2, methyl binding domain (MBD) protein 1, MBD2, and MBD4. Each of these factors contains a conserved methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) but otherwise exhibits little sequence similarly. A fifth protein, MBD3, also contains the MBD domain but has not been shown to bind to methylated DNA. MBD2 and MBD3 are components of the histone deacetylase complexes MeCP1 and Mi-2, respectively (12Ng H.-H. Zhang Y. Hendrich B. Johnson C.A. Turner B.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Teinberg D. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 13Wade P.A. Gegonne A. Jones P.L. Ballestar E. Aubry F. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar), thus linking cytosine methylation with histone acetylation and providing a unifying framework for the control of chromatin structure and gene regulation. A major unanswered question is how specific CpG motifs become methylated during development and how CpG islands remain hypomethylated despite an open chromatin configuration and free access to DNA methyltransferases. Others have noted that the ubiquitous transcription factor Sp1 binds to sites within some CpG islands (its consensus recognition site is GGGGCGGGG) and protects the CpG island of the adenine phosphoribosyltransferase gene from cytosine methylation (14Macleod D. Charlton J. Mullins J. Bird A.P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2282-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 15Brandeis M. Frank D. Keshet I. Siegfried Z. Mendelsohn M. Nemes A. Temper V. Razin A. Cedar H. Nature. 1994; 371: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). This has led to a model in which DNA binding proteins such as Sp1 may protect CpG islands from methylation. However, Sp1 is not required for maintaining hypomethylation of CpG islands because CpG islands remain hypomethylated after disruption of the Sp1 gene in mice (16Marin M. Karis A. Visser P. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Cell. 1997; 89: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). We have previously described a novel transcriptional activating DNA binding protein termed CpG-binding protein (CGBP) that specifically binds to sequences that contain unmethylated CpG dinucleotides (17Voo K.S. Carlone D.L. Jacobsen B.M. Flodin A. Skalnik D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2108-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Hence, CGBP may play a role both in the expression of genes associated with CpG islands as well as in the regulation of cytosine methylation. Inspection of the CGBP sequence reveals the presence of several domains, including two copies of the plant homeodomain (PHD), a coiled-coil domain, basic and acidic stretches, and a highly conserved cysteine-rich CXXC domain that is also found in human trithorax (HRX, also known as MLL or ALL-1), MLL-2, DNMT1, and MBD1 (17Voo K.S.

In these studies we determine that the CXXC domain comprises the sole DNA binding domain of CGBP and identify the consensus DNA binding sequence for CGBP.

Three CGBP binding site oligonucleotides recovered from ligand selection (see “Results”) were also synthesized (oligonucleotides 32, 38, and 48). Mutated versions of oligonucleotides 38 and 48 were also prepared: 48, TCTGGTGTAGGCCCGACCAACTTAACCGAGACAC; 48-Mut1, TCTGGTGTAGGCCTGACCAACTTAACCGAGACAC; 48-Mut2, TCTGGTGTAGGCCCGACCAACTTAACTGAGACAC; 48-Mut3, TCTGGTGTAGGCCTGACCAACTTAACTGAGACAC; 48-Mut4, TCTGGTGTAGGCTCGTCCAACTTAATCGTGACAC; 38, TCTGGTGTAATACTGCCCACACAGACCGAGACAC; 38-Mut, TCTGGTGTAATACTGCCCACACAGACTGAGACAC; 32, TCTGGTGGCGATAACTAAAGAAACATCGA- GACAC. Various regions of the human CGBP cDNA were amplified by PCR and subcloned into the pQE9 6×His-tag expression vector to identify the DNA binding domain(s) of CGBP. The following primers were used to amplify the indicated regions of CGBP cDNA by PCR. Each primer name starts with 5′ or 3′ to indicate forward or reverse primers, respectively. The letters in each primer designation indicate the CGBP amino acids encoded by the end of the amplified fragment. Recovered DNA fragments were subcloned into SalI- and HindIII-digested or BamHI- andHindIII-digested pQE9 6×His-tag expression vector. Amino acids 1–153: 5′-MEG (CATCACGTCGACATGGAGGGAGATGGTTCAGAC) and 3′-QSP (CTAATTAAGCTTCTGGCTGGGTGTGGCCACCAAG). Amino acids 106–285: 5′-GGG (CATCACGGATCCGGTGGAGGGCGCAAGAGGCCTG) and 3′-PLD (CTAATTAAGCTTAGAGGTAGGTCCTCATCTGAG). Amino acids 231–656: 5′-SLP (CATCACGTCGACTCCCTGCCAAGGCCCCGCCGG) and 3′-RDA (CTAATTAAGCTTGCGGTCGGCACTGGAGCGCAG). Amino acids 142–250: 5′-SSP (CATCACGGATCCTCCTCTCCGCAGCCCTTGGTG) and 3′-KQS (CTAATTAAGCTTCTTCTGTGATGGCTGTGGCTG). Amino acids 162–250: 5′-IKR (CATCACGGATCCATCAAACGGTCAGCCCGCATG) and 3′-KQS. Amino acids 162–231: 5′-IKR and 3′-PLS (CTAATTAAGCTTTGGCAGGGACTCTGAGGGCGTC). Amino acids 162–221: 5′-IKR and 3′-LSS (CTAATTAAGCTTGAGCGAGGAAGGGAAGTACTTG). Amino acids 162–212: 5′-IKR and 3′-ERA (CTAATTAAGCTTTTCCCGGG- CCCGCAGCTGGCA). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the CXXC domain of CGBP using primers that mutate cysteine residues to alanine. Each mutation was introduced into a fragment containing amino acids 142–250 of CGBP using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, CA) in accordance with the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Mutagenesis oligonucleotides include CXXCA (mutates cysteine 169 to alanine), CGGTCAGCCCGCATGGCTGGTGAGTGTGAGGCATG, and CXXCB (mutates cysteine 208 to alanine), GCCGGCTGCGCCAGGCCCAGCTGCGGGCCC. The nucleotide sequences of truncated and mutated CGBP constructs were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. Escherichia coli cells were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 1.0. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was added to 0.2 mm, and cells were grown for an additional 4–6 h. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 50 μl of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline/ml of culture. Cells were sonicated for 10 min on ice, Tween 20 was added to a final concentration of 0.6% to facilitate solubilization of protein, and samples were incubated on ice for 30 min. Lysate was then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min. Supernatant was loaded onto a His-Trap purification column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The protein was washed with excess phosphate-buffered saline and eluted with 500 mm imidazole. The samples were dialyzed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% glycerol, and the dialysate was stored at −80 °C. For Western blot analysis, 0.5 μg of partially purified protein was solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis on a 10–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (MSI, Westborough, MA). The membrane was then incubated with anti-6×His-tag monoclonal antibody (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) followed by horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse antiserum and detected by using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. EMSA was performed as described previously (21Skalnik D.G. Strauss E.C. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16736-16744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, 0.01–0.1 μg of partially purified CGBP protein was incubated with 0.5 μg of herring sperm (Amresco) or 1 μg of poly(dA-dT) on ice for 15 min in a 40-μl reaction volume before the addition of competitor double-stranded oligonucleotides. After an additional 30-min incubation on ice, 40,000 cpm of end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe was added to the reaction and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. EMSA samples were loaded onto a 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris (pH 8.3), 45 mm borate, 1.25 mm EDTA), 6–9% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel, and electrophoresis was performed at 200 V at room temperature for 2 h. Oligonucleotide probes were radiolabeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase using [γ-32P]ATP followed by annealing with equal molar complementary strand oligonucleotide. Radiolabeled probes were resolved by electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and eluted by the crush and soak method (22Sambrook J. Fitsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 6.46-6.48Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide methylation was accomplished by incubating DNA with SssI methylase and S-adenosylmethionine as recommended by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), and as previously described (17Voo K.S. Carlone D.L. Jacobsen B.M. Flodin A. Skalnik D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2108-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Denaturation and renaturation of the minimal DNA binding domain of CGBP was performed as described (23Hagman J. Gutch M.J. Lin H. Grosschedl R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2907-2916Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μg of partially purified protein (amino acids 162–221) was diluted to 2.5 ml in denaturation buffer (6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 20 mm HEPES, 100 μm KCl, 10% glycerol, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 3 mm EDTA, and 3 mm EGTA) and dialyzed as 400-μl aliquots against two changes of the same buffer (without bovine serum albumin) for 1 h at 4 °C. Samples were then dialyzed against denaturation buffer (without EDTA and EGTA) followed by four successive dilutions (1:1) of the dialysate with renaturation buffer (same as denaturation buffer but lacking guanidine hydrochloride, EDTA, and EGTA) supplemented with either 10 μm CaCl2, CdCl2, MgCl2, NiCl2, or ZnCl2. Samples were recovered and stored at 4 °C until analyzed by EMSA as described above. A 6×His-tagged CGBP fragment (amino acids 106–345) that contains the CXXC domain, adjacent acidic domain, and a portion of a basic domain (17Voo K.S. Carlone D.L. Jacobsen B.M. Flodin A. Skalnik D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2108-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) was partially purified using His-Trap purification columns as described above and used to select binding sequences from a pool of degenerate oligonucleotides. Repeated EMSA and PCR amplification of bound oligonucleotides were performed as described (24Mavrothalassitis G. Beal G. Papas T.S. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 783-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The degenerate oligonucleotides consisted of 57-mers containing a stretch of 20 degenerate nucleotides (N) flanked by anchor sequences: TCTGGGATCCTTCTGGTG-NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN-GAGACACTGGGAATTCCAG. The EcoRI and BamHI sites designed to facilitate subcloning of the selected fragments are underlined. The oligonucleotides were made double-stranded by hybridization with end-labeled primer complementary to the downstream anchor sequence and elongation for 30 min at 30 °C with deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates and Klenow DNA polymerase. These double-stranded oligonucleotides (0.3 μg) were incubated with 5 μg of 6×His-tagged CGBP partially purified protein in the presence of 2.5 μg of herring sperm DNA in 60 μl of EMSA reaction buffer. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide gel, and bound oligonucleotides were excised and eluted as above, extracted with phenol/chloroform, and ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in 50 μl of water. PCR reactions were performed in a 100-μl volume using 5 μl of the DNA recovered from the retarded protein-DNA complex and 20 pmol of primers complementary to the flanking anchor sequences. PCR reactions were incubated for 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 50 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C for 30 cycles in a DNA thermal cycler. The amplified DNA was subjected to eight additional cycles of binding selection and PCR amplification. After the first round of selection the 6×His-tagged CGBP fusion protein was reduced to 2.5 μg. The competitor DNA was changed to 1.0 μg of poly(dA-dT) after the 5th round of selection. The recovered fragments were digested with EcoRI andBamHI, purified on an 8% polyacrylamide gel, ligated intoEcoRI- and BamHI-digested pBluescript KS (Stratagene), and transformed into E. coli DH5α cells. Individual clones were isolated, and the nucleotide sequence was determined by the dideoxy method (Sequenase 2.0, U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Experiments were performed to identify the domain(s) of CGBP responsible for the unique DNA binding specificity for sequences containing unmethylated CpG dinucleotides. Overlapping fragments of human CGBP were expressed as 6×His-tagged proteins and tested for DNA binding activity in EMSA using the previously described CpG-pos binding site of CGBP as a probe (17Voo K.S. Carlone D.L. Jacobsen B.M. Flodin A. Skalnik D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2108-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The CpG-pos oligonucleotide corresponds to an element derived from the human gp91phox promoter (21Skalnik D.G. Strauss E.C. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16736-16744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This sequence has been mutated to prevent binding of CCAAT box binding factors (17Voo K.S. Carlone D.L. Jacobsen B.M. Flodin A. Skalnik D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2108-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Mutation of the CCAAT box to CCGGT introduced a CpG motif into the sequence. The CGBP fragment containing amino acids 106–345 includes the CXXC domain, an adjacent acidic domain, and a portion of a basic domain (Fig.1 A). CGBP amino acids 106–285 include the CXXC domain and a portion of the acidic domain, amino acids 1–153 include the PHD1 domain, and amino acids 231–656 contain the acidic, basic, coiled-coil, and PHD2 domains. CGBP fragments containing either amino acids 106–345 or 106–285 exhibit DNA binding activity (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2and 3), whereas protein fragments containing amino acids 1–153 or 231–656 fail to bind the DNA probe (Fig. 1B, lanes 4 and 5). Each of the 6×His-tagged CGBP protein fragments was successfully expressed and recovered from E. coli, as demonstrated by Western blot analysis of each protein sample (Fig. 1 C). Multiple bands in some samples presumably reflect partial proteolysis. Hence, the DNA binding domain of CGBP resides within amino acids 106–285. Furthermore, the absence of DNA binding activity by overlapping CGBP fragments suggests that CGBP contains a single DNA binding domain that resides within amino acids 153–231, a fragment that contains the CXXC domain. Additional studies were conducted on smaller fragments of CGBP to more precisely define the DNA binding domain (Fig.2 A). As predicted from the results presented in Fig. 1, the 142–250-amino acid region of CGBP exhibits DNA binding activity (Fig. 2 B, lane 2). The 162–250-amino acid fragment of CGBP, which is truncated to within 2 residues of the amino end of the CXXC domain, continues to exhibit DNA binding activity (Fig. 2 B, lane 3). Successive truncations of the carboxyl terminus reveals that a fragment as small as amino acids 162–221 exhibits DNA binding activity (Fig.2 B, lanes 4 and 5). This 60-amino acid fragment contains the CXXC domain as well as 15 residues of the carboxyl flanking region. Further truncation of 9 residues from the carboxyl tail (leaving amino acids 162–212) ablates DNA binding activity (Fig. 2 B, lane 6). Each 6×His-tagged protein was successfully recovered from E. coli, as determined by Western blot analysis presented below the EMSA result (Fig. 2 B). Hence, a 60-amino acid fragment of CGBP (amino acids 162–221) that contains the CXXC domain comprises the DNA binding domain. Native CGBP binds specifically to DNA containing unmethylated CpG motifs (17Voo K.S. Carlone D.L. Jacobsen B.M. Flodin A. Skalnik D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2108-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Additional studies were performed to determine whether the minimal DNA binding domain of CGBP retains this DNA binding specificity. Fig. 2 C demonstrates that the EMSA complex produced by the 162–221 amino acid fragment of CGBP is efficiently disrupted by competition with oligonucleotide homologous to the probe (Fig. 2 C, lanes 3–5) but not by a similar sequence (CpG-neg) that lacks the CpG motif (Fig. 2 C,lanes 6–8). Importantly, the complex is also not disrupted by the CpG-pos oligonucleotide after methylation in vitro(Fig. 2 C, lanes 9–11). Hence, the 162–221-amino acid fragment of CGBP exhibits a DNA binding specificity indistinguishable from that previously described for CGBP (17Voo K.S. Carlone D.L. Jacobsen B.M. Flodin A. Skalnik D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2108-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Site-specific mutagenesis was performed to determine if an intact CXXC domain is required for the DNA binding activity exhibited by the 142–250-amino acid fragment of CGBP. Fig.3 A presents a sequence alignment of eight reported CXXC domains (17Voo K.S. Carlone D.L. Jacobsen B.M. Flodin A. Skalnik D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2108-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 18Huntsman D.G. Chin S.-F. Muleris M. Batley S.J. Collins V.P. Wiedemann L.M. Aparicio S. Caldas C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7975-7984Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 19Cross S.H. Meehan R.R. Nan X. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 256-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Eight of the 10 perfectly conserved residues are cysteines. We chose to mutate to alanine either the first or last cysteine residue. Each mutated form of CGBP was purified from E. coli as a 6×His-tagged protein, and DNA binding activity to the CpG-pos probe was analyzed by EMSA (Fig. 3 B). Mutation to alanine of either cysteine 169 or cysteine 208 completely abolished the DNA binding activity of this fragment of CGBP (Fig. 3 B, lanes 2 and3). Successful recovery of each 6×His-tagged protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis, as shown below the EMSA result. We conclude that an intact CXXC domain is required for the DNA binding activity of CGBP. The structure of the CXXC domain is distantly related to a zinc finger, although it does not exactly fit the consensus arrangement of cysteines and histidines. Furthermore, the CXXC domain from DNMT1 has been demonstrated to bind zinc (25Bestor T.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2611-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). We examined whether zinc is required for the observed DNA binding activity of the CXXC domain of CGBP. Purified 6×His-tagged CGBP fragment containing amino acids 162–221 was denatured in the presence of EDTA and EGTA and then renatured in the presence of various divalent metal cations. Fig. 4 demonstrates that the addition of zinc to the renaturation buffer (lane 7) is required to reconstitute efficient CGBP DNA binding activity to the CpG-pos probe. Previous work demonstrated that CGBP binds to DNA elements containing an unmethylated CpG dinucleotide (17Voo K.S. Carlone D.L. Jacobsen B.M. Flodin A. Skalnik D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2108-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed to determine the consensus DNA binding site of CGBP. The 6×His-tagged CGBP protein fragment containing amino acids 106–345 was used in a ligand-selection assay to recover high affinity CGBP binding sites from a pool of degenerate oligonucleotides. After nine cycles of binding and PCR amplification, the nucleotide sequences of recovered oligonucleotides were determined (Fig.5 A). Interestingly, all 50 sequences contained a cytosine residue at the 3′-most degenerate position, thus creating a CpG motif because the adjacent nucleotide contributed by the flanking PCR anchor sequence is guanine. Alignment of the 50 sequences at the 3′-CpG motif reveals that 45 of the 50 sequences contained an adenine or cytosine at the position immediately upstream of the CpG motif. Furthermore, the anchor PCR primer contains an adenine at the position immediately downstream of the CpG dinucleotide. No consensus sequence was otherwise apparent from this alignment, although adenine nucleotides are over-represented, composing 46% of the total nucleotides present in the degenerate region of the oligonucleotides. All but one of the recovered sequences (oligonucleotide 38) contain additional CpG motifs elsewhere within the degenerate region of the oligonucleotide. Thirty-five of the recovered oligonucleotides carry a single additional CpG motif within the body of the degenerate sequence. Alignment of these sequences at the internal CpG reveals a similar preference for adenine or cytosine nucleotides at the positions immediately adjacent to the CpG motif and a general preference for adenine-rich DNA elements (Fig. 5 B). Hence, the consensus binding site for CGBP appears to be (A/C)CpG(A/C). Additional experiments were performed to directly assess whether ligand selection resulted in the recovery of high affinity binding sites for CGBP from the pool of degenerate oligonucleotides. Sequence 48 (Fig.5 A) contains two CpG motifs, both of which are present within the context of the consensus flanking sequence CCpGA. This DNA sequence disrupts the CGBP/CpG-pos probe EMSA complex more efficiently than does the homologous CpG-pos competitor, which carries a single CpG motif in the non-consensus context of CCpGG (Fig.6, compare lanes 3–5 tolanes 6–8). As expected, the CpG-neg oligonucleotide competitor fails to disrupt the CGBP complex (Fig. 6, lanes 9–11). These results indicate that the ligand-selection process recovered high affinity CGBP binding sites. Studies were performed to test the hypothesis that CGBP requires CpG dinucleotides for binding to the ligand-selected oligonucleotides and that adjacent adenine or cytosine nucleotides contributes to optimal binding affinity. Three ligand-selected sequences were chosen for analysis (Fig. 7 A); they are sequence 48, which was described above and contains two CpG motifs; sequence 38, which contains a single CpG motif in the context of flanking cytosine and adenine nucleotides (CCpGA); and sequence 32, which contains two CpG motifs in the context of non-consensus flanking sequences (GCpGA and TCpGA). Mutation of either CpG motif within the 48 sequence (48-Mut1 and 48-Mut2) results in a slight decrease in CGBP binding affinity (Fig.7 B, compare lanes 3–5 to lanes 6–8and 9–11). However, simultaneous mutation of both CpG motifs (48-Mut3) drastically reduces the CGBP binding affinity (Fig.7 B, lanes 12–14). Interestingly, mutation to thymine of the nucleotides flanking each CpG motif (48-Mut4) also decreases CGBP binding affinity (Fig. 7 B, comparelanes 3–5 with 15–17). In fact, this alteration has a similar effect on CGBP binding as mutating a single CpG motif (compare 48-Mut4 to 48-Mut1 and 48-Mut2). Mutation of the single CpG motif within the 38 sequence (38-Mut) ablates the CGBP binding affinity, as no disruption of the complex is observed with increasing concentration of competitor (Fig. 7 B, compare lanes 18–20 to lanes 21–23). CGBP exhibits a weaker affinity for the 32 sequence, which contains two CpG motifs in the context of non-consensus flanking sequence (GCpGA and TCpGA). We conclude that the presence of a CpG dinucleotide is a requirement for CGBP binding and that binding affinity is strengthened by the presence of multiple CpG motifs and the presence of adenine or cytosine nucleotides immediately adjacent to the CpG dinucleotide. We previously utilized a ligand-screening approach to clone CGBP, a novel transcriptional activator that binds specifically to DNA elements containing an unmethylated CpG motif(s) (17Voo K.S. Carlone D.L. Jacobsen B.M. Flodin A. Skalnik D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2108-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The DNA binding activity of CGBP was demonstrated to reside within amino acids 106–345, a protein fragment that contains a CXXC domain. This domain is found in several DNA-binding proteins including HRX, MLL-2, DNMT1, and MBD1 (17Voo K.S. Carlone D.L. Jacobsen B.M. Flodin A. Skalnik D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2108-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 18Huntsman D.G. Chin S.-F. Muleris M. Batley S.J. Collins V.P. Wiedemann L.M. Aparicio S. Caldas C.

The studies described here establish that the CXXC domain is responsible for the unique DNA binding specificity of CGBP and define the preferred DNA binding site of this transcriptional activator. The presence of the CXXC domain in a number of proteins that bind to CpG motifs is intriguing, although the function of this domain had not been clearly established. The CXXC domain resides within a fragment of DNMT1 that inhibits de novo methylation activity (25Bestor T.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2611-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) and interacts with HDAC1 (26Fuks F. Burgers W.A. Brehm A. Hughes-Davies L. Kouzarides T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar), and it has been reported to function as a transcriptional repression domain within the HRX protein (27Zeleznik-Le N. Harden A.M.

With the exception of CGBP, proteins that contain a CXXC domain additionally contain other distinct DNA binding domains such as the methyl binding domain, AT-hooks, and zinc fingers (19Cross S.H.

Furthermore, the CXXC domain is dispensable for the DNA binding activity exhibited by DNMT1 and MBD1 (19Cross S.H. Meehan R.R. Nan X. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 256-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 25Bestor T.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2611-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The studies reported here demonstrate that the minimal DNA binding domain of CGBP resides within a 60-amino acid domain (amino acids 162–221) that includes the CXXC domain. An intact CXXC domain is essential for DNA binding activity, as mutation to alanine of either of two conserved cysteine residues within the CXXC domain ablates DNA binding activity. Consistent with a requirement for a defined arrangement of highly conserved cysteine residues, CGBP requires the presence of Zn2+ for DNA binding activity. The minimal CXXC DNA binding domain of CGBP exhibits a DNA binding specificity for elements containing an unmethylated CpG dinucleotide. Shortly after our description of the cloning of CGBP, Fujino et al. (33Fujino T. Hasegawa M. Shibata S. Kisimoto T. Imai S.-I. Takano T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) independently report the cloning of this factor (denoted PCCX1 in that report). They reported this factor as a regulator of the interstitial collagenase gene, MMP-1, and determined that a fragment containing amino acids 144–231, which includes the CXXC domain, exhibits DNA binding activity. Surprisingly, the MMP-1 promoter element used in this one-hybrid screen lacks a CpG motif. However, linkers added to the end of the promoter fragment introduced CpG dinucleotides, likely explaining the paradoxical binding affinity of CGBP for this promoter element. Consistent with the determined binding specificity of CGBP (17Voo K.S. Carlone D.L. Jacobsen B.M. Flodin A. Skalnik D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2108-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), the binding of CGBP to the MMP-1 promoter element was not disrupted by an unrelated oligonucleotide that lacked a CpG motif but was disrupted by a mutated version of the MMP-1 promoter element that retained the linker CpG dinucleotides (33Fujino T. Hasegawa M. Shibata S. Kisimoto T. Imai S.-I. Takano T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Hence, CGBP does not appear to be an authentic regulator of the MMP-1promoter. Given our findings that the CXXC domain of CGBP exhibits affinity for unmethylated CpG motifs, it will be of interest to determine in more detail the structural requirements for this unique DNA binding specificity. These results also highlight the importance of additional studies on the contribution of the CXXC domain to the DNA binding activity of factors such as DNMT1, MBD1, HRX, and MLL-2 that contain additional distinct DNA binding domains (17Voo K.S.

Genet. 1997; 16: 256-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Fujita et al. (34Fujita N. Shimotake N. Ohki T. Chiba T. Saya H. Shirakawa M. Nakao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5107-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) recently report that an alternatively spliced form of MBD1 binds either methylated or unmethylated promoters and attribute the ability to bind unmethylated DNA to the presence of a third copy of the CXXC domain. Interestingly, the CXXC domain from CGBP exhibits the highest degree of sequence homology (60% identity) to this alternatively utilized CXXC domain of MBD1. Inspection of ligand-selected CGBP binding sites reveals a consensus sequence of (A/C)CpG(A/C). As expected, all recovered oligonucleotides contain at least one CpG dinucleotide, and introduction of mutations that remove the CpG motif(s) ablate the affinity of CGBP for these sequences. Introduction of mutations that either alter the sequence flanking the CpG dinucleotide or reduce the number of CpG motifs leads to a reduction in the affinity of CGBP. These results support the consensus CGBP binding site deduced from inspection of ligand-selected sequences recovered from a pool of degenerate oligonucleotides. Interestingly, in 20 of the 35 recovered sequences containing two CpG dinucleotides, these motifs are spaced 12–16 base pairs apart. Mutation of individual CpG motifs reduces the affinity of CGBP. These results suggest that CGBP exhibits greater affinity for clustered regions of CpG motifs, as found in CpG islands. The studies reported here establish that the CXXC domain is responsible for the observed binding specificity of CGBP for unmethylated CpG motifs and provide fundamental information regarding the structural basis for the unique DNA binding specificity of CGBP. These data should aid in future efforts to identify authentic target genes of CGBP action in vivo as well as more detailed analyses of the function of CXXC within other DNA-binding proteins."

The G2 arrest after damage is, in part, mediated by the p53 target, 14-3-3ς (ς). Colorectal tumor cells lacking ς are exquisitely sensitive to DNA damage. Here we analyzed the mechanism of this sensitivity in ς−/− as compared with ς+/+ human colorectal tumor cells. Exposure to adriamycin resulted in rapid apoptosis only in ς−/−cells. This was further characterized by caspase-3 activation, p21CIP1 cleavage, and CDK2 activation. Moreover, Bax was rapidly translocated out of the cytoplasm, and cytochrome cwas released in ς−/− cells. Transient adenovirus-mediated reconstitution of ς in the ς−/−cells led to effective rescue of this phenotype and protected cells against apoptosis. The association of ς, Bax, and CDK1 in protein complexes may be the basis for this antiapoptotic mechanism.

After DNA damage cells are either arrested at cell cycle checkpoints or forced to undergo apoptosis in the face of irreparable damage (1Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2279) Google Scholar, 2Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6673) Google Scholar, 3Vogelstein B.

Both scenarios of either arrest or apoptosis contribute to the overall maintenance of genetic stability. At least two distinct pathways lead to apoptosis, both of which converge on caspases as downstream effectors. The TNF-R/Fas-triggered apoptotic pathway recruits caspase-8 to activate caspase-3, one of the effector caspases (5Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar, 6Villa P. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 388-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). The second pathway depends on the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and subsequent binding to Apaf-1, which is followed by the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. This second pathway is blocked by the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (7Sentman C.L. Shutter J.R. Hockenbery D. Kanagawa O. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1991; 67: 879-888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar, 8Strasser A. Harris A.W. Cory S. Cell. 1991; 67: 889-899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). A probable third pathway for the initiation of apoptosis involving the endoplasmic reticulum and caspase-12 has recently been described (9Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2912) Google Scholar). Although the final executors of apoptosis are proteins of the caspase family, it is not fully understood by which mechanisms p53 mediates apoptosis; many p53-induced genes might be involved (10Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). Recent evidence shows that p53-dependent apoptosis may proceed through the Apaf-1/caspase-9 pathway (11Soengas M.S. Alarcon R.M. Yoshida H. Giaccia A.J. Hakem R. Mak T.W. Lowe S.W. Science. 1999; 284: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). However, the complete set of pathways connecting p53 to these proteins upstream in the caspase cascade remains to be elucidated. The p53-induced G1/S arrest is primarily mediated through the induction of p21CIP1 (12Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3200) Google Scholar, 13Funk J.O. Galloway D.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 337-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). p53 regulates the G2/M checkpoint through induction of 14-3-3ς (ς), a protein that sequesters CDK1 in the cytoplasm (14Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Polyak K. He T.C. Zhang L. Thiagalingam S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 3-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). Other p53-dependent effects, e.g. repression of CDK1 and cyclin B1 promotor activities, have also been reported to contribute to the G2 arrest (15Innocente S.A. Abrahamson J.L. Cogswell J.P. Lee J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2147-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 16Passalaris T.M. Benanti J.A. Gewin L. Kiyono T. Galloway D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5872-5881Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). ς is a component of the G2/M checkpoint because its overexpression leads to G2 arrest (14Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Polyak K. He T.C. Zhang L. Thiagalingam S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 3-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar), and cells lacking ς are defective in a stable G2 arrest (17Chan T.A. Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1999; 401: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). However, additional p53-independent mechanisms exist to initiate the G2/M checkpoint, because under certain conditions cells lacking p53 also enter G2arrest (16Passalaris T.M. Benanti J.A. Gewin L. Kiyono T. Galloway D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5872-5881Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 18Herzinger T. Funk J.O. Hillmer K. Eick D. Wolf D.A. Kind P. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2051-2056Google Scholar). The p53-independent G2 arrest is regulated through phosphorylation of CDC25C phosphatase by the CHK1 and CHK2 kinases (19Furnari B. Blasina A. Boddy M.N. McGowan C.H. Russell P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 833-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 20Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1893-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar) and cytoplasmic sequestration. Sequestered CDC25C is unable to activate CDK1 and thereby prevents entry into mitosis. In the face of DNA damage, ς is believed to protect damaged cells from entry into mitosis by binding and sequestering CDK1/cyclin B1 complexes in the cytoplasm (17Chan T.A. Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1999; 401: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). p21 is also required for the maintenance of G2 arrest, because damaged p21−/− cells progress into mitosis but fail to complete cytokinesis (14Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Polyak K. He T.C. Zhang L. Thiagalingam S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 3-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar, 21Waldman T.

Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2505) Google Scholar). Additionally, cleavage of p21 has been reported to be part of the events in the progression of apoptosis (23Gervais J.L. Seth P. Zhang H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19207-19212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar,24Zhang Y. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1131-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Simultaneous loss of both p21 and ς renders cells to be more sensitive to DNA damage than those lacking either of the two genes, indicating their cooperative roles in the G2/M checkpoint (25Chan T.A. Hwang P.M. Hermeking H. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1584-1588PubMed Google Scholar). To understand the mechanisms of cell death that underlie the sensitivity to DNA damage and to examine the role of ς after DNA damage, we compared ς−/− cells with their parental HCT 116 counterparts. The results indicate that in addition to its known role in securing the G2/M checkpoint, ς functions to protect against apoptosis by affecting Bax localization. HCT116 wild type cells and ς−/− clone of HCT116 derived by homologous recombination were cultured as described (17Chan T.A. Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1999; 401: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Adriamycin was used at a final concentration of 0.7 μg/ml in culture medium. Both adherent and floating cells were collected for lysate preparations. For reconstitution, ς−/− cells were infected with a ς expressing adenovirus (14Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Polyak K. He T.C. Zhang L. Thiagalingam S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 3-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar) for 6 h. They were then left untreated or damaged with adriamycin (ADR).1 Both adherent and floating cells were collected for lysis and fractionation. Cell lysates were prepared by brief sonication in cell lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, either with 0.1% Tween 20 or without detergent. Immunoprecipitations were performed essentially as described (26Funk J.O. Waga S. Harry J.B. Espling E. Stillman B. Galloway D.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2090-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The beads were washed with lysis buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20. For fractionation of lysates, the cells were lysed by Dounce homogenization in 0.2 m mannitol, 50 mmsucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with added protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Unlysed cells and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min. The resultant supernatant was centrifuged at 17,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C to yield cytosolic supernatant and mitochondrial-enriched pellet. The pellet was washed once with the lysis buffer and solubilized in 10× volume lysis buffer with 1% Nonidet P-40 for 15 min on ice. Solubilized proteins were examined by immunoblotting. Whole cell lysates were prepared by resuspending intact cell pellets in cell lysis buffer above containing 1% Nonidet P-40 for 30 min on ice followed by centrifugation at 17,000 ×g. Primary antibodies for the detection of the various proteins were purchased from the following sources: p53 (Ab-6), Raf-1 (Ab-2), p21 (Ab-1), and 14-3-3τ/θ (Calbiochem), cyclin B1, cytochrome c, and Bax (Pharmingen), caspase-3, CDK2, CDK1, 14-3-3ζ, 14-3-3γ, 14-3-3ε, 14-3-3β, Bad (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and activated caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technologies). CIP1-associated regulator of cyclin B1 (CARB) antibody was generated as described (27McShea A. Samuel T. Eppel J.T. Galloway D.A. Funk J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23181-23186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The affinity-purified antibody against 14-3-3ς used here was generated earlier (17Chan T.A. Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1999; 401: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Kinase assays were performed as described elsewhere (26Funk J.O. Waga S. Harry J.B. Espling E. Stillman B. Galloway D.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2090-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Annexin-V staining and DNA laddering tests were done using Annexin-V Fluos and apoptotic DNA ladder kits, respectively, from Roche Biochemicals. For flow cytometry, the cells were trypsinized and fixed in 70% ethanol for at least an overnight. Staining was done with a solution of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween 20, 2% fetal calf serum, 0.5 μg/μl RNase A, and 50 μg/μl propidium iodide. The assay was done using FACScan (Becton Dickinson), and the readouts were analyzed using CellQuest software. The cells were fixed with methanol/acetone (1:1) for 5 min at −20 °C and stained as described (27McShea A. Samuel T. Eppel J.T. Galloway D.A. Funk J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23181-23186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Blocking and antibody incubations were done in phosphate-buffered saline with 2% bovine serum albumin and 30% goat serum. Double immunofluorescence stainings were performed using CY2-conjugated anti-rabbit and CY3-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Images were taken using Leica DMRB/E fluorescence microscope with I3 and N2.1 filters. DePsipher (R & D Systems) staining was done according to the manufacturer's instructions. Culture medium was used instead of the provided reaction buffer. The cells were incubated with the DePsipher solution for 15 min in the incubator. Following exposure to ADR, both ς+/+ and ς−/− cells showed up-regulation of p53 (Fig.1 A). Unexpectedly, while p21 was up-regulated and maintained at high protein levels in the ς+/+ cells, p21 levels were reduced and two distinct bands of 21 and 15 kDa were apparent in the ς−/− cells (Fig. 1 A), consistent with cleavage of the protein. Cleavage of p21 at its C terminus (between amino acids 112 and 113) by caspase-3 or caspase-3-like enzymes has been reported during apoptosis of both cancer cells (24Zhang Y. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1131-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (28Levkau B. Koyama H. Raines E.W. Clurman B.E. Herren B. Orth K. Roberts J.M. Ross R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 553-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). In accordance with this, caspase-3 was found to be activated only in the ς−/− cells, concomitant with the cleavage of p21. This coincided with the progression of apoptosis in ς−/−cells (see below), which were detaching from the culture plates and massively floating in the culture medium (data not shown). Subsequently, we assayed for CDK2 kinase activity to examine the functional integrity of p21 in DNA-damaged ς+/+ and ς−/− cells. There was no decrease but rather an increase in CDK2 activity in ς−/− cells coinciding with p21 cleavage. In contrast to this, a profound down-regulation of CDK2 activity was observed in ς+/+ cells, in which p21 was induced and not cleaved (Fig. 1 A). In addition to the assessment of p21 function, we looked at the status of the functionally related CARB, which has been suggested to contribute to the retention and protection from degradation of cyclin B1 in the cytoplasm (27McShea A. Samuel T. Eppel J.T. Galloway D.A. Funk J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23181-23186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting for CARB and cyclin B1 proteins revealed that CARB was degraded, with the appearance of a smaller fragment in damaged ς−/− cells, coinciding with a sharp decrease in cyclin B1 level (Fig. 1 A). Because p53 was up-regulated following DNA damage to identical levels in both ς−/− and ς+/+ cells (Fig.1 A), we looked further into the events upstream of p21 cleavage. For this purpose, cell-permeable inhibitors of caspase-3 (Z-DEVD-FMK) and caspase-9 (Z-LEHD-FMK) as well as the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK were employed. Caspase-3 activation and p21 cleavage were effectively blocked in ς−/− cells by both caspase-3 and caspase-9 inhibitors (Fig. 1 B). Following caspase inhibition, damaged ς−/− cells did not undergo apoptosis and stayed arrested for over 72 h (Fig.2 D and data not shown). Because other members of the 14-3-3 protein family have also been implicated in the protection of cells from apoptosis (29Xing H. Zhang S. Weinheimer C. Kovacs A. Muslin A.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 30Datta S.R. Katsov A. Hu L. Petros A. Fesik S.W. Yaffe M.B. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar), we compared the endogenous levels of expression of 14-3-3ζ, 14-3-3γ, 14-3-3ε, 14-3-3τ/θ, and 14-3-3β in ς+/+ and ς−/− cells. Whereas ς was up-regulated in ς+/+ cells after ADR-induced damage, all other 14-3-3 family members were equally expressed in both cell types, irrespective of DNA damage (Fig. 1 C). The activation of caspase-3, cleavage of p21, and detachment of cells from culture plates was suggestive of an apoptotic process in ς−/− cells. To prove this further, undamaged as well as damaged ς+/+ and ς−/− cells were examined for early or late apoptotic marker events. The apoptotic phenotype of the ς−/− cells was evident by the accumulation of a sub-G1 population, positive annexin-V staining, and the occurrence of DNA laddering (Fig. 2, A–C). These results confirmed that ς−/− cells were indeed undergoing apoptosis, and there was no indication of G2 arrest. The ς+/+ cells, however, did not undergo significant apoptosis during this time and remained arrested (Fig. 2 and data not shown). The distribution and activities of either pro- or anti-apoptotic proteins in subcellular compartments is critical to the outcome after DNA damage. Therefore, subcellular distribution of caspase-3 and Bax was examined by analyzing cytosolic and mitochondrial-enriched fractions of ς+/+ and ς−/− cells exposed to ADR. Activation of cytosolic caspase-3 was detected only in ς−/− cells about 36 h after damage (Figs.1 A and 3 A). In addition to its presence in the cytosolic fraction, the cleaved active form of caspase-3 was also detected in the mitochondrial fractions of ς−/− cells. The relative abundance of the active form of the enzyme in the mitochondrial fractions was higher as compared with the procaspase form in the same fractions (Fig. 3 A). The detection of equal levels of Raf-1 in the cytosolic and the nonspecific band in the mitochondrial fractions (Fig. 3 A) served as fractionation controls. ς was only present in the cytosolic fractions (Fig. 3 B). Additionally, there was a profound decline in the level of cytosolic Bax in damaged ς−/− cells, and importantly, basal and DNA damage-induced Bax protein levels in whole cell lysates were identical in ς+/+ and ς−/− cells (Fig.3 C). These data and the absence of any detectable cleavage products suggested relocalization of Bax (Fig. 3 A). This further coincided with cytochrome c release as evidenced by its rapid increase only in the cytosolic fractions of the ς−/− cells. In contrast, damaged ς+/+cells retained Bax in the cytosol without reduction over the duration of the examination and with no significant cytochrome crelease. To exclude subsequent genetic alterations in the ς−/−cells as a cause for the increased apoptotic responsiveness and to prove that ς was solely responsible for this phenotype, ς was reconstituted in the ς−/− cells by adenovirus-mediated transient gene transfer (ad-ς). Thereby it was possible to reconstitute ς in 100% of the cells as determined by immunofluorescence stains (Ref. 14Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Polyak K. He T.C. Zhang L. Thiagalingam S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 3-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar and data not shown). The time point for the examination of ς-reconstituted cells was deliberately chosen so that a ς overexpression phenotype, as observed in wild type cells (14Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Polyak K. He T.C. Zhang L. Thiagalingam S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 3-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar), did not yet occur. Following infection with either ad-ς or, as a control, ad-GFP, the cells were damaged with adriamycin and analyzed for the presence of cytoplasmic Bax and apoptosis at different time points. Indeed, the reconstitution of ς effectively reduced the loss of cytoplasmic Bax and lead to partial prevention of apoptosis (Fig.4 A), whereas ad-GFP infection had no detectable influence on these parameters (Fig. 4 B and data not shown). Following the observation that Bax was retained cytosolic in ς+/+ but not in ς−/− cells, we examined whether this effect is mediated by binding of ς to Bax. We hypothesized that, following DNA damage, ς regulates the redistribution of Bax from the cytoplasm. To test this model, anti-ς immunoprecipitates were examined for the presence of Bax and other known 14-3-3-associating proteins. We found that anti-ς immunoprecipitates from damaged ς+/+ cells contained Bax (Fig. 5 A). Bad, another proapoptotic protein of the Bcl-2 family that is known to bind other 14-3-3 proteins, was not co-immunoprecipitated. In accordance with previous data (17Chan T.A. Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1999; 401: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar), CDK1 also bound ς after DNA damage to a similar degree (Fig. 5 A). The reverse immunoprecipitation with anti-Bax antibodies could not be interpreted because of nonspecific bands on the protein blot at the position of ς. Control immunoprecipitates of 14-3-3ζ from both ς+/+ and ς−/− cells did not contain Bax, nor did ς antibody immunoprecipitate Bax from ς−/− cells (Fig.5 B). Furthermore, we examined whether Bax associates with CDK1 complexes, which might contribute to the retention of Bax in the cytosol. Therefore immunoprecipitates of Bax and CDK1 proteins were analyzed for possible complex formation. Interestingly, anti-Bax immunoprecipitates from damaged ς+/+ cells but not from ς−/− cells (data not shown) contained CDK1 and vice versa (Fig. 5 C). In undamaged ς+/+ cells there was only a very weak co-immunoprecipitation of CDK1 with Bax, hinting that ς, CDK1, and Bax may form a trimeric protein complex. Because we observed evidence for the translocation of Bax in ς−/− cells, we traced the mitochondrial localization and Bax redistribution before and after treatment with ADR. By immunofluorescence analysis with antibodies against Bax and the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase, a redistribution of Bax and aggregation of mitochondria around the centrosome was observed in over 95% of the ς−/− cells as early as 24 h after DNA damage (Fig. 6 A and data not shown). The centrosomal concentration of Bax and mitochondria was confirmed by counterstaining the damaged ς−/− cells with γ-tubulin, which marked the center of the site of aggregation (Fig. 6 B). At this time, both ς−/− and ς+/+ cells were still adherent to the plates, but ς−/− cells started to detach from the plates a few hours later, when cytosolic caspase-3 was activated. The localization of ς and CDK1 under these conditions has previously been demonstrated (17Chan T.A. Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1999; 401: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). To rule out a fixation artifact or the possibility that the cells showing mitochondrial aggregation were only shrinking, undamaged and damaged ς−/− cells were stained with DePsipher reagent, which stains the mitochondria in live cells without the need for fixation. Microscopic evaluation of the stained cells clearly showed that at the time of the aggregation of mitochondria, detectable 24 h after DNA damage, the cells were still adherent to the slides without evidence of shrinkage (Fig. 6 C). We elaborated a mechanism by which ς, a p53-induced mediator of G2 arrest, potentially counteracts apoptosis. In both ς+/+ and ς−/− cells, p53 was up-regulated to identical levels after ADR-induced DNA damage. Although ς+/+ cells also up-regulated ς and arrested in G2, ς−/− cells proceeded without delay into apoptosis, showing all the characteristic features, including caspase-3 activation. During this time, Bax remained predominantly cytosolic in ς+/+ cells, whereas in ς−/− cells there was a pronounced shift of Bax out of the cytosolic compartment. These results indicate that ς, up-regulated upon DNA damage, is involved in the regulation of the progression of apoptosis by affecting the distribution of Bax. The precise nature of this regulation and the question as to whether the association between ς and Bax is direct or indirect deserves further analysis. However, because ς binds to Bax equally well and under identical conditions as it binds to CDK1 (Ref.17Chan T.A. Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1999; 401: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar and Fig. 5), this suggests that this association likely has a regulatory effect. The identical expression of other 14-3-3 family members in both ς+/+ and ς−/− cells, the fact that these 14-3-3 proteins are not up-regulated upon DNA damage, and the effect of 14-3-3ς reconstitution altogether suggest that this protection from apoptosis is specific for 14-3-3ς. In the absence of ς, Bax appears to be readily translocated to mitochondria and probably other organelles, and this may sensitize the cells for rapid progression into apoptosis through caspase-3 activation. Interestingly, immunofluorescence analysis of ADR-treated ς−/− cells showed a relocalization of Bax and aggregation of mitochondria around the centrosomes. The existence of caspases-2 and -9 zymogens (31Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Brenner C. Larochette N. Prevost M.C. Alzari P.M. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 381-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar) and of procaspase-3 (32Samali A. Cai J. Zhivotovsky B. Jones D.P. Orrenius S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2040-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) in mitochondrial fractions has previously been reported. We further present evidence that active caspase-3 might also be present in the mitochondria, possibly because of influx from the cytosolic compartment. ς is exclusively expressed in cells of epithelial origin (33Prasad G.L. Valverius E.M. McDuffie E. Cooper H.L. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 507-513PubMed Google Scholar, 34Leffers H. Madsen P. Rasmussen H.H. Honore B. Andersen A.H. Walbum E. Vandekerckhove J. Celis J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 982-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In natural and in vitro cultured epidermal cell layers, the expression of ς is limited to the suprabasal layer formed by the progeny of basal cells that exit the cell cycle to initiate keratinization (35Dellambra E. Golisano O. Bondanza S. Siviero E. Lacal P. Molinari M. D'Atri S. De Luca M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1117-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the exact same layer of cells in the epidermis express the proapoptotic protein Bax, whereas the more superficial layers express other proapoptotic proteins like Bak (36Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2849-2855PubMed Google Scholar). The simultaneous expression of two functionally antagonistic proteins in suprabasal cells, which are at a stage prior to the dominance of pro-apoptotic proteins, might indicate a balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins before these cells undergo terminal differentiation. This also supports our conclusion that ς counteracts premature apoptosis. On the other hand, selective down-regulation of ς by promotor methylation has been shown to frequently occur in breast and hepatocellular carcinomas (37Ferguson A.T. Evron E. Umbricht C.B. Pandita T.K. Chan T.A. Hermeking H. Marks J.R. Lambers A.R. Futreal P.A. Stampfer M.R. Sukumar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6049-6054Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 38Iwata N. Yamamoto H. Sasaki S. Itoh F. Suzuki H. Kikuchi T. Kaneto H. Iku S. Ozeki I. Karino Y. Satoh T. Toyota J. Satoh M. Endo T. Imai K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5298-5302Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of ς in tumor cells may contribute to malignant transformation, whereas at the same time it may sensitize the cells to the effects of chemotherapeutic DNA damage. The degree to which ς is involved in the sensitization of cells may possibly be different for various forms of DNA damage. It is not clear whether p21 cleavage is essential for the progression into apoptosis or whether it is just an intermediate. Previous studies showed that p21 cleavage is an early event in apoptosis (23Gervais J.L. Seth P. Zhang H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19207-19212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The requirement for the CDK inhibitory activity of p21 to prevent apoptosis has also been demonstrated; a p21 mutant incapable of binding CDK2 failed to protect cells from irradiation- or chemical-induced apoptosis (39Lu Y. Yamagishi N. Yagi T. Takebe H. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 705-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Furthermore, p21 cleavage might mediate apoptosis through CDK2 activation (28Levkau B. Koyama H. Raines E.W. Clurman B.E. Herren B. Orth K. Roberts J.M. Ross R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 553-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar); alternatively, p21 cleavage might be involved during the progression of apoptosis (24Zhang Y. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1131-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Because ς−/− cells undergo apoptosis with p21 cleavage, our results conform with the notion that cleavage of p21 at its C terminus, with subsequent loss of its CDK-inhibitory function, is an important determinant for the progression of apoptosis. Simultaneous with the cleavage and loss of function of p21, there was also loss of CARB, a protein suggested to contribute to the cytoplasmic maintenance of cyclin B1 proximal to the centrosome (27McShea A. Samuel T. Eppel J.T. Galloway D.A. Funk J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23181-23186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The observed decrease of cyclin B1 levels in ς−/− cells may be partially attributable to the loss of CARB, because such a loss would leave cyclin B1 free to be degraded. This mechanism of loss of cyclin B1 may add to the previously reported direct effect of p53 on the expression of the protein (15Innocente S.A. Abrahamson J.L. Cogswell J.P. Lee J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2147-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 16Passalaris T.M. Benanti J.A. Gewin L. Kiyono T. Galloway D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5872-5881Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Finally, our results demonstrate that lack of ς in colorectal tumor cells sensitizes them to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Therefore, strategies to target ς during chemotherapy might contribute to the therapeutic efficiency. Besides its G2/M checkpoint functions, ς also plays a role in the prevention of the progression of apoptosis by influencing the subcellular distribution of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax. This implies that the p53-induced G2 arrest may be accompanied by a separate mechanism to delay apoptosis. The dual activities of p53 to induce either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis therefore seem to function in a manner such that one pathway is delayed or prevented if the other is induced. We thank B.

https://openalex.org/W1520149501,"Activation of β-catenin/T cell factor (TCF) transcription as a result of mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and/or β-catenin genes occurs in the majority of colon tumors. An increasing number of genes, including c-myc and cyclin D1, have been implicated as targets of this pathway. We now report that the dominant negative helix-loop-helix regulator Id2 is also a target of the β-catenin/TCF transcription pathway in colon adenocarcinoma. Investigation of the mechanism for the overexpression of Id2 in colon carcinoma cells demonstrated that the Id2 promoter is activated, and the Id2 protein is up-regulated by β-catenin. Conversely, reducing free β-catenin blocked this induction of promoter activity. We have also used an electrophoretic mobility shift assay and supershift to identify a motif in the Id2promoter that binds to TCF4 protein. Site-directed mutagenesis of this motif abolished promoter reporter activity. Both transfection ofId2 into SW480 cells and induction of Id2 in HT29 colon cells was found to increase anchorage-independent survival of these cells. Growing evidence associates disruption to Id2 expression with tumorigenesis, and our findings suggest that this dysregulation of Id2 expression is due to the activation of the β-catenin/TCF pathway.

T cell factor chloramphenicol acetyltransferase green fluorescent protein helix-loop-helix inhibitor of differentiation/DNA binding tetracycline polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid adenomatous polyposis coli Mutations in the APC and β-catenin genes are common in human colonic cancer (1Hlsken J. Behrens J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Behrens J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 910: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). These mutations lead to the accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm and its translocation to the nucleus. In the nucleus, β-catenin associates with T cell factor (TCF)1 leading to the formation of a bipartite transcription factor that activates transcription of target genes such as c-myc and cyclin D1 (for a review, see Ref. 2Behrens J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 910: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The helix-loop-helix (HLH) family of transcription factors has been implicated in transcriptional regulation, oncogenesis, cell type determination, and differentiation (3Norton J.D. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3897-3905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HLH structure that distinguishes this class of molecules mediates protein dimerization within the HLH family (4Murre C. McCaw P.S. Vaessin H. Caudy M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cabrera C.V. Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Lassar A.B. Cell. 1989; 58: 537-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). Many members of the HLH family contain a domain of basic amino acids, amino-terminal to the HLH motif, which mediates DNA binding following dimerization. A HLH subfamily has been identified, known as the Id (inhibitors of differentiation/DNA binding) proteins, that lacks this basic region and possesses the ability to act as dominant negative molecules (5Israel M.A. Hernandez M.C. Florio M. Andres-Barquin P.J. Mantani A. Carter J.H. Julin C.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1726-1730PubMed Google Scholar). One member of the Id subfamily, Id2, regulates proliferation and differentiation. Thus, deregulated Id2 expression has the potential for malignant transformation. In support of this hypothesis, overexpression of Id2 has been demonstrated in human pancreatic cancer (6Kleeff J. Ishiwata T. Friess H. Buchler M.W. Israel M.A. Korc M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3769-3772PubMed Google Scholar). Preliminary observations suggesting a correlation between β-catenin and Id2 expression in colonic polyps led us to explore the possibility that Id2 is a target of β-catenin/TCF-mediated transcription. Samples of tumor, polyp, and normal tissue were obtained from patients undergoing Surgery at Western Hospital, Victoria, Australia. The collection of tissues was approved by the relevant hospital ethics committee. The colon carcinoma cell lines used in this study have been described previously (7Roczo N. Whitehead R.H. Phillips W.A. Baindur-Hudson S. Thomas R.J.S. Rockman S.P. GI Cancer. 2000; 3: 259-268Google Scholar). Colon carcinoma cell lines and the adenovirus immortalized human kidney cell line (HEK-293) were grown as monolayers in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% (v/v) bovine calf serum (CSL Ltd., Parkville, Victoria, Australia) at 37 °C in a fully humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in air. Immunohistochemistry was performed on serial paraffin sections as described previously (8Guesdon J. Ternynck T. Avrameas S. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1979; 27: 1131-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1412) Google Scholar) according to a commercially adapted method (DAKO Corp., Carpinteria, CA) using new fuchsin chromogen as substrate. Sections of 5 μm thickness were incubated with either rabbit anti-Id2 polyclonal antibody (1:200) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or an equivalent dilution of nonimmune rabbit serum. Id1, Id3, Id4, and E2A rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used to control for nonspecific binding. Specific Id2 immunoreactivity was also demonstrated by competition with an Id2-specific blocking peptide (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Anti-β-catenin monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Los Angeles, CA) was used at 1:100 on sections treated by boiling in 0.1 m sodium citrate (pH 6.0) for 20 min to unmask antigen prior to blocking. To confirm the expression ofId2, we performed in situ hybridization essentially as described by Brand et al. (9Brand K. Bowtell D. Sambrook J. DNA Microarrays: A Molecular Cloning Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Briefly, digoxigenin-labeled RNA was generated using T7 polymerase (40 units, Promega Corp., Madison, WI) and restriction endonuclease-linearized pCDNA3.1-Id2 sense and antisense plasmids as templates. Sections were hybridized at 50 °C overnight. Bound probe was detected using an anti-digoxigenin monoclonal antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals GmbH), and the color reaction was developed using nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as a substrate. Sections were counterstained with acid fuchsin for 2 min at room temperature. Cell lysates (50 μg/lane) were resolved by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBS-T) and incubated with anti-Id2 rabbit polyclonal antiserum (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 18 h at 4 °C followed by swine anti-rabbit polyclonal antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Blots were washed in TBS-T, and bound antibody was detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were then stripped by incubation in 62.5 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 6.7, containing 2% (w/v) SDS and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 50 °C for 30 min. Membranes were subsequently blocked and immunoblotted with a pan actin monoclonal antibody (ICN Biomedicals Inc., Aurora, OH) or anti-V5 monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands). Full-length sense and antisense Id2 constructs were cloned into the pCDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen). V5-tagged Id2 constructs were generated using the pCDNA3.1/V5 vector (Invitrogen) with a reverse primer without the Id2stop codon (nucleotides 479–498; GCCACACAGTGCTTTGCTGT). The Myc-tagged ΔN89 β-catenin (lacking the 89 N-terminal amino acids) expression vector has been described previously (10Munemitsu S. Albert I. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4088-4094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The human expression vectors E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain and E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain Δ (that lacks the β-catenin interaction domain) have also been described elsewhere (11Crawford H.C. Fingleton B.M. Rudolph-Owen L.A. Goss K.J. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Matrisian L.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2883-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). To create the Id2 Tet-inducible HT29 cell line, Id2 cDNA was subcloned into the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing plasmid pBI-EGFP (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA). Sense and antisence constructs were co-transfected with pTet-On/IREF/puro (a gift of Dr. M. O'Connell, Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute, Melbourne, Australia). Transfected cells were selected with puromycin (2 μg/ml) sorted against GFP without induction by fluorescence-activated cell sorting initially and then by sorting following induction with doxycycline (100 ng/ml). Cells were plated at 4 × 105 cells/well 24 h prior to transfection. One microgram of each plasmid was transfected with 3 μl of FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assays were performed as described previously (12Ramsay R.G. Friend A. Vizantios Y. Freeman R. Sicurella C. Hammett F. Armes J. Venter D. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1805-1809PubMed Google Scholar). The −834 to +30 Id2 promoter-CAT reporter (13Kurabayashi M. Jeyaseelan R. Kedes L. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 311-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) activity was compared with pCAT-basic (Promega Corp.). Site-directed mutagenesis of the −834 to +30 Id2 plasmid was performed by using the “QuickChange” site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the instructions of the manufacturer. In all cases the addition of empty vector pCDNA3.1 was used to ensure equivalent DNA levels in all transfections. Id2 promoter binding ofin vitro synthesized protein (TNT, Promega Corp.) or nuclear lysates were assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay following the methods described previously (14Ramsay R. Tymms M. In Vitro Transcription and Translation Protocols. 37. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1995: 369-377Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide sequence corresponding to bases −109 to −85 within the 5′ Id2flanking region (GATCCGCTCGTCTTGATAGACG) and containing a putative TCF binding site (underlined) was used. Oligonucleotides modified by the addition of a T to create a consensus TCF4 site (underlined) (GATCCGCTCGTCTTTGATAGACG) or a C to disrupt the putative TCF binding site (GATCCGCTCGTCTCTGATAGACG) were used as controls. Confirmation of in vitro synthesized TCF4 protein was determined by incorporation of [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and standard SDS-PAGE. Binding reactions (2 μg of nuclear extract protein) were incubated for 20 min at room temperature before addition of 0.25 μg of either anti-TCF4 monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) or an irrelevant control monoclonal antibody and then incubated for a further 20 min. The samples were subsequently subjected to nondenaturating PAGE at 4 °C. The gels were examined using Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager SI and analyzed using ImageQuant software (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Transfection conditions were identical to those described above. Transfected SW480 cells were selected with 1 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 7–10 days and then analyzed for colony growth by plating in 0.5% (w/v) soft agar, 20% (v/v) bovine calf serum at 1,000 cells/dish. Colony numbers were enumerated after 10 days of culture. HT29 empty vector and Id2 sense and antisense cell lines were plated in semisolid agar as described above and cultured with and without induction by the addition of 2 μg/ml doxycycline. We have used immunohistochemistry to examine the expression of Id2 in human adenomatous polyps. Increased levels of Id2 expression were observed in the majority of adenomas examined (49/59) (Fig.1 A). No staining was detected in normal colon mucosa (data not shown). The expression of Id2 in polyps was confirmed in selected cases by in situhybridization (Fig. 1 B). Where Id2 expression was raised, the pattern of expression was heterogeneous with areas of high expression and areas without staining (Fig. 1 C). We also detected heterogeneous β-catenin expression in 51/59 adenoma cases (Fig. 1 C). In 48/59 adenoma cases there was a striking similarity in the pattern of β-catenin and Id2 expression with staining confined to specific crypts (Fig. 1, A andC). Of the 11 cases with no Id2 staining, 8 also failed to stain with β-catenin, and 3 had only low β-catenin expression. We have also used the TOPFLASH/FOPFLASH-TCF reporter system (15Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2896) Google Scholar) to demonstrate a close correlation between β-catenin/TCF-mediated transcriptional activity and the expression of Id2 in these colon cancer cell lines (Table I). Cell lines exhibiting TOPFLASH activity (for example SW480 and LIM1215) (Table I) were found to express high levels of Id2 by Northern (Fig. 2) and Western analysis (data not shown). Conversely cell lines that did not activate the TOPFLASH reporter (for example LIM2405 and LIM2412) expressed only low levels of Id2.

Albert I. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4088-4094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and determined the level of Id2 protein expression. Levels of Id2 protein were found to be increased in cells overexpressing β-catenin (Fig.3 A) but not in cells overexpressing c-Myc (Fig. 3 B). Transfection of cells with the ΔN89 β-catenin resulted in an average 3-fold increase in expression of Id2 protein as determined by densitometry in three independent experiments. To address the mechanism by which β-catenin was increasing Id2 expression we examined the effect of β-catenin on the Id2promoter. Co-transfection of a −834 to +30 Id2 promoter-CAT reporter construct with the ΔN89 β-catenin expression vector into HEK-293 cells resulted in a 3-fold induction of the Id2promoter activity compared with co-transfection with an empty vector (Fig. 4 A). This induction of the Id2 promoter activity by ΔN89 β-catenin could be prevented by co-transfection of the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin (Fig. 4 A), a molecule that is known to sequester β-catenin (11Crawford H.C. Fingleton B.M. Rudolph-Owen L.A. Goss K.J. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Matrisian L.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2883-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in SW480 cells that have high nuclear β-catenin levels due to a mutation in the APC protein (Table I), reintroduction of the wild type APC protein was found to reduce the levels ofId2 promoter activity (Fig. 4 B). Analysis of the Id2 5′ flanking region sequence (GenBankTM accession number AF270493) demonstrated that theId2 promoter contains a site on the negative strand (ATCAAG) at −95 that is similar to a reported optimal TCF binding site (WWCAAAG where W = A or T) (15Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2896) Google Scholar). We constructed oligonucleotides containing either the wild type Id2 promoter sequence or the promoter sequence that had been modified to contain an optimal TCF binding site. In vitro synthesized TCF4 was able to bind both these oligonucleotides as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Similarly, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay was used to demonstrate that nuclear lysates of colon cancer cells contained a protein able to bind oligonucleotides containing the wild type and optimal TCF binding sites but not an oligonucleotide in which the putative TCF binding site had been disrupted (Fig.5 A). Furthermore, the binding of the protein could be competed with unlabeled oligonucleotide (100-fold w/w excess) containing the wild type promoter sequence but not with the oligonucleotide containing the disrupted site (data not shown). Specific retardation of both the optimal TCF probe and theId2 probe by an anti-TCF4 monoclonal antibody indicated the presence of TCF4 protein. The importance of the putative TCF4 binding site was also demonstrated using the Id2 promoter reporter assay. Mutation of the ATCAAG site in the −834 to +30 Id2promoter to an irrelevant sequence by site-directed mutagenesis rendered the Id2 promoter refractory to activation by co-transfection of β-catenin/TCF4 (Fig. 5 B). The finding that Id2 is a target of β-catenin/TCF-mediated transcription suggested a role for Id2 in colon carcinogenesis. Increased Id2 protein was demonstrated in colon tumors by Western blotting (Fig. 6). In addition, transient transfection of Id2 was found to result in a 3-fold increase in clonogenicity of human colon carcinoma cells in semisolid agar (Fig.7 A). However, we were unable to demonstrate increases in Id2 protein levels in the colonies due to the small numbers of cells recovered in these experiments.Figure 7Effect of Id2 on the growth of colon cells in semisolid agar. A, SW480 cells were transfected with empty vector (EV) or full-length Id2 sense (S) or Id2 antisense (AS) constructs. Forty-eight hours after transfection 1 × 103cells/dish were seeded into semisolid agar and cultured for 10 days after which time the number of colonies was counted. Results are expressed as percentage of the empty vector control. Shown are the means ± S.E. from two experiments performed in triplicate.B, HT29 cells stably transfected with the Tet-inducibleId2 sense and antisense construct. Cells transfected with empty vector (lanes 1 and 4), V5-tagged Id2 sense construct (lanes 2 and 5), and an antisense construct (lanes 3 and 6) treated with (+,lanes 1–3) or without (−, lanes 4–6) 2 μg/ml doxycycline (Dox) for 18 h were solubilized, resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with antibodies to V5 and Id2. Immunoreactive proteins were detected with an appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. C, HT29 cells (1 × 103/dish) were seeded in semisolid agar in the presence of doxycycline (2 μg/ml) and cultured for 10 days after which time the number of colonies was counted. Results are expressed as percentage of the empty vector control. Shown are the means ± S.E. from three experiments performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To confirm these findings we created cell lines of the colon carcinoma HT29 cells that express an inducible Id2 construct. Empty vector and antisense constructs served as controls. We tagged the doxycycline-inducible Id2 with a V5 tag to differentiate it from the endogenous Id2 protein. Immunoblot analysis probing with both an anti-V5 monoclonal antibody and polyclonal Id2 antiserum demonstrated increased Id2 expression following induction with doxycycline (Fig.7 B). Induction of the antisense construct reduced the expression of endogenous Id2 (Fig. 7 B). Consistent with our transient transfection results we demonstrated that induced expression of Id2 increased the clonogenicity of HT29 cells (Fig.7 C). Here we have demonstrated that Id2 is a target of the β-catenin/TCF pathway. In colonic polyps, the pattern of Id2 expression correlates with the pattern of β-catenin expression. Similarly, human colon tumors, which are known to harbor a high frequency of APC and β-catenin mutations that result in increased levels of β-catenin, also have increased levels of Id2. Consistent with these findings, human pancreatic tumors, which express increased levels of Id2 (6Kleeff J. Ishiwata T. Friess H. Buchler M.W. Israel M.A. Korc M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3769-3772PubMed Google Scholar, 16Maruyama H. Kleeff J. Wildi S. Friess H. Buchler M.W. Israel M.A. Korc M. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 815-822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), have been shown to contain β-catenin and, to a lesser extent, APC mutations (17Gerdes B. Ramaswamy A. Simon B. Pietsch T. Bastian D. Kersting M. Moll R. Bartsch D. Digestion. 1999; 60: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It is also of interest to note that transgenic mice overexpressing the related protein Id1 develop intestinal adenomas but not carcinomas (18Wice B.M. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25310-25319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), a phenotype very similar to that seen in mice carrying an APCmutation (19Moser A.R. Pitot H.C. Dove W.F. Science. 1990; 247: 322-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that β-catenin can increase the level of Id2 protein and activate the Id2 promoter in vitro. Although the levels of Id2 increased only modestly, the result is consistent with our in vitro reporter assays (Fig.4 A). It should also be noted that while the increase in β-catenin levels shown in Fig. 3 A appear dramatic, the anti-Myc antibody used to detect the tagged protein detects only transfected protein and not endogenous β-catenin. Immunoblotting with an anti-β-catenin antibody failed to detect the expressed protein, presumably due to the interference in the binding of the antibody to its epitope by the C-terminal tag. It is thus not possible to ascertain the true relative increase in β-catenin levels achieved by transfection. We were, however, able to confirm that the modest increase in Id2 protein was not due to insufficient TCF levels in the transfected cells as co-transfection of TCF4 with β-catenin did not appreciably increase the level of Id2 (data not shown). β-Catenin/TCF is known to activate transcription of a number of genes including the transcription factor c-myc (20He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H. Zawel L. da Costa L.T. Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1998; 281: 1509-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (4026) Google Scholar). A recent study demonstrated increased Id2 promoter activity induced by N-Myc or c-Myc in neuroblastoma cells (21Lasorella A. Noseda M. Beyna M. Iavarone A. Nature. 2000; 407: 592-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). This raised the possibility that the induction of Id2 expression by β-catenin in our study could be secondary to induction of c-Myc. However, theId2 promoter construct used in our study does not contain any canonical Myc sites. More importantly, we found that, in contrast to β-catenin, c-Myc overexpression in HEK-293 cells did not alter the level of Id2 protein. We also provide evidence that the Id2promoter contains a functional TCF binding site providing a mechanism for the direct activation of Id2 transcription by β-catenin/TCF. Thus it appears that in colon cells the Id2gene is a direct target of the β-catenin/TCF pathway. To investigate the functional consequences of Id2 overexpression, we have analyzed colon cells transfected with Id2 sense and antisense constructs for colony formation in semisolid agar. Colon cells transfected with Id2 sense constructs formed an increased number of colonies. This is particularly interesting since the basal Id2 levels in the cell lines used are already high. However, while this result may appear counterintuitive, it was a reproducible finding with both transient transfection and induced Id2 expression. This finding is consistent with the work of Atherton et al.(22Atherton G.T. Travers H. Deed R. Norton J.D. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1059-1066PubMed Google Scholar) who demonstrated that the constitutive expression of Id3 rather than the actual Id3 level influenced the biology of myotubule formation in semisolid agar. It is well established that Id levels decrease when cells enter quiescence (3Norton J.D. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3897-3905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), such as when cells are first cultured in agar. It is thus possible that in agar culture the constitutive expression of Id2 is maintaining Id2 levels when Id2 levels would otherwise decrease. The mechanism through which Id2 promotes the clonogenic growth of colon cells is not clear. However several possibilities exist. Id2 has been demonstrated to heterodimerize with members of the E2A family of transcription factors preventing binding to DNA (23Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1785) Google Scholar, 24Sun X.H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5603-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). E2A molecules are known to suppress cell growth by activating transcription of inhibitors of cell cycle progression such as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Cip1/Waf1 (25Prabhu S. Ignatova A. Park S.T. Sun X.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5888-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) and, potentially, p15 or p16 (26Pagliuca A. Gallo P. De Luca P. Lania L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1376-1382PubMed Google Scholar). Increased Id2 expression could, by sequestering E2A, release the E2A-mediated suppression of cell growth. Alternatively, or in addition, Id2 has been reported to directly interact with the cell cycle control protein Rb (27Iavarone A. Garg P. Lasorella A. Hsu J. Israel M.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1270-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 28Lasorella A. Iavarone A. Israel M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2570-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). This direct interaction of Id2 with Rb leads to the expression of genes required for progression through S phase of the cell cycle. It is interesting to note that in our studies many of the crypts that display enhanced Id2 expression also display morphological and structural similarity to crypts without high levels of Id2 or β-catenin suggesting that Id2 overexpression does not, on its own, affect crypt morphology. This may indicate that further genetic disruptions occur in vivo that result in the dysplastic features of adenomatous polyps. We would therefore suggest that Id2 might act as a “landscaping gene” allowing unrestrained proliferation and the further chance of genetic alteration (29Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 280: 1036-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). In summary, we have demonstrated that the dominant negative HLH transcriptional regulator Id2 is a target of the β-catenin/TCF pathway and suggest that overexpression of Id2 as a consequence ofAPC and β-catenin mutations may play an important role in human tumorigenesis.

The role and function of these stress-activated RBP are, however, poorly understood. The data presented here indicate that the RBP A18 heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) is induced and translocated from the nuclei to the cytoplasm after exposure to UV radiation. Using a new in vitro system we identified potential cellular targets for A18 hnRNP. Forty-six mRNA transcripts were identified, most of which are stress- or UV-responsive genes. Two important stress-responsive transcripts, the replication protein A (RPA2) and thioredoxin, were studied in more detail. Northwestern analyses indicate that A18 hnRNP binds specifically to the 3′-untranslated region of RPA2 transcript independently of its poly(A) tail, whereas the poly(A) tail of thioredoxin mRNA reinforces binding. Overexpression of A18 hnRNP increases the mRNAs stability and consequently enhances translation in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, cell lines expressing reduced levels of A18 hnRNP are more sensitive to UV radiation. These data suggest that A18 hnRNP plays a protective role against genotoxic stresses by translocating to the cytosol and stabilizing specific transcripts involved in cell survival.

It includes multiple regulatory mechanisms that are generally thought to have protective roles. Cells respond to stress in a limited number of ways by adjusting regulatory components of basic processes such as replication, transcription, and/or translation. Much emphasis has been put on stress responses involving replication or the activation of specific genes in response to DNA damage (1Fornace Jr., A.J. Jackman J. Hollander M.C. Hoffman-Liebermann B. Liebermann D.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 663: 139-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar); however, the regulation of post-transcriptional and translational events in response to stress has not been studied extensively. Post-transcriptional regulation can be mediated through interaction of regulatory proteins with an mRNA 3′ end (2Gray N.K. Wickens M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 399-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). This mechanism, which occurs in several organisms, is not fully understood. Most regulations of this type have been observed during early development of different organisms from Caenorhabditis elegans to mammals (3Huarte J. Stutz A. O'Connell M.L. Gubler P. Belin D. Darrow A.L. Strickland S. Vassalli J.D. Cell. 1992; 69: 1021-1030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). One possible mechanism by which regulation of translation initiation can be mediated through the 3′ end of an mRNA transcript has suggested that specific proteins bound to this region could contact the basal translation apparatus and influence translational activation or repression (2Gray N.K. Wickens M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 399-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). A recent review (4Shyu A.B. Wilkinson M.F. Cell. 2000; 102: 135-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) described the possibility for RNA-binding proteins to shuttle between cellular compartments either constitutively or in response to stress and regulate the localization, translation, or turnover of mRNAs. Post-transcriptional regulation can also occur through mRNAs stabilization. Recent studies describe the stabilization of mRNAs by specific RBPs1 in response to hypoxia (5Paulding W.R. Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2532-2538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) or extracellular signals (6Westmark C.J. Malter J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1119-1126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In a previous study (7Carrier F. Gatignol A. Hollander M.C. Jeang K.T. Fornace Jr., A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1554-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) we have shown that RNA binding activity of specific proteins can be induced by DNA-damaging agents. Induction of an RBP at the mRNA levels was first reported for the A18 hnRNP after UV radiation (8Fornace Jr., A.J. Alamo Jr., I. Hollander M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8800-8804Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). The hnRNPs are a sub-group of ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) found in the nucleus and involved in RNA processing (9Soulard M. Della Valle V. Siomi M.C. Pinol-Roma S. Codogno P. Bauvy C. Bellini M. Lacroix J.C. Monod G. Dreyfuss G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4210-4217Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The A18 hnRNP was originally cloned by hybridization subtraction on the basis of rapid induction in UV-irradiated Chinese hamster ovary cells (8Fornace Jr., A.J. Alamo Jr., I. Hollander M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8800-8804Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Since then, the human A18 hnRNP was cloned and characterized (10Sheikh M.S. Carrier F. Papathanasiou M.A. Hollander M.C. Zhan Q., Yu, K. Fornace Jr., A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26720-26726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The human A18 hnRNP is a rather unique RNP. In addition to containing a conserved RNA binding domain, it also contains several repeats of an RGG box in its auxiliary domain (10Sheikh M.S. Carrier F. Papathanasiou M.A. Hollander M.C. Zhan Q., Yu, K. Fornace Jr., A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26720-26726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The RGG boxes were first identified as single-stranded nucleic acid binding motifs in an hnRNP that does not contain the conserved RNA binding domain (11Kiledjian M. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2655-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). The auxiliary domains of RNPs are associated with protein-protein interaction (9Soulard M. Della Valle V. Siomi M.C. Pinol-Roma S. Codogno P. Bauvy C. Bellini M. Lacroix J.C. Monod G. Dreyfuss G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4210-4217Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar); therefore, the presence of single-stranded nucleotide binding domains in this location is unusual. In this report we show that the nuclear A18 hnRNP is not only induced but also translocated to the cytoplasm in response to UV radiation. In addition, we established an in vitro system to isolate and identify A18 hnRNP most probable mRNA targets. Forty-six mRNAs transcripts have been identified, a large proportion of which are UV- or stress-responsive. Our data indicate that A18 hnRNP binds specifically to the 3′-UTR of the replication protein A (RPA2) and the human thioredoxin mRNAs. Co-transfection of A18 hnRNP with a CAT expression vector resulted in increased message stability and CAT activity. Moreover, cells expressing reduced levels of A18 hnRNP are more sensitive to UV radiation. Taken together these data suggest that stabilization of stress-responsive transcripts by A18 hnRNP may protect the cells against genotoxic insults. To express A18 hnRNP in mammalian cells, the open reading frame (ORF) of A18 hnRNP cDNA was cloned into theHindIII/XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The A18 hnRNP-GFP fusion expression vector was constructed by amplifying the coding region of GFP from pEGFP (Invitrogen) and cloning it downstream of A18 hnRNP into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). For constitutive expression of the CAT protein, the ORF of CAT was cloned into the NheI/BamHI sites of pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) to generate the plasmid pcDNA3.1-CAT (CAT). The 3′-UTR of RPA2 was amplified by PCR from the full-length cDNA of RPA2 and cloned into the BamHI/XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1-CAT to generate the plasmid pcDNA3.1-CAT/RPA2–3′-UTR (CAT-UTR). To generate the antisense A18 hnRNP vector, the ORF of A18 hnRNP was cloned in antisense orientation into the HindIII/XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1. The human colorectal carcinoma RKO cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For transient transfection, cells were cultured to 80% confluency, and the indicated plasmids were transfected with Fugene 6 lipid mix (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A total amount of 11 μg of plasmids DNA was maintained by supplementing with pcDNA3.1. Each dish received 1 μg of CAT or CAT-UTR expression vector and up to 10 μg of A18 hnRNP. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested and lysed for further analyses. Analyses were performed in triplicate. For stable transfection, hnRNP A18-GFP was transfected into 50% confluent RKO cells. Selection was performed with 400 μg/ml hygromycin B for 2 weeks. Clonogenic survival after UV irradiation was performed by colony formation assay. The RKO antisense cell line was established by stable transfection of the pCDNA3.1 expression vector containing the A18 hnRNP ORF in the antisense orientation into RKO cells. Single colonies were expanded, and expression levels of A18 hnRNP were verified by Western blot. About 200 cells were seeded/100-mm dish for overnight growth, then the medium was removed, and the cells were irradiated with the indicated dose of UV. Treatments were performed in triplicate for each dose. Two weeks later, colonies containing more than 50 cells were counted. The CAT activity was measured essentially as described before (12Carrier F. McCary J.M. Bae I. Yarosh D.B. Fornace Jr., A.J. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1994; 10: 767-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Cellular extracts containing either 50 or 25 μg of protein were incubated at 37 °C for 1–3 h and separated on TLC plates. The conversion of chloramphenicol was quantified on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics STORM) with the ImageQuant software. The A18 hnRNP-GFP-overexpressing cells were grown on coverslips and treated with UV radiation at a dose of 20 J/m2. Cells were put back into culture for 3 h, and fluorescence was observed with a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Axioskop, objective 10×, HB100-W mercury lamp). The hnRNP A18 cDNA-coding region (516 base pairs) (10Sheikh M.S. Carrier F. Papathanasiou M.A. Hollander M.C. Zhan Q., Yu, K. Fornace Jr., A.J. J. Biol.

Expression was achieved inEscherichia coli BL21(DE3) as recommended by the manufacturer (Novagen) except that the bacteria were grown at 30 °C. Soluble proteins were loaded on a nickel nitrilotriacetic acid column (Novagen) and stepwise eluted with 100–350 mm imidazole. The imidazole was removed by gel filtration on a D-Salt Excellulose desalting column (Pierce). The recombinant protein was finally dialyzed against 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. pT7TAR was transcribed and labeled as described before (7Carrier F. Gatignol A. Hollander M.C. Jeang K.T.

Different regions of RPA2 and thioredoxin cDNAs were amplified by PCR with a T7 promoter (5′-AGTGAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′) engineered at their 5′ ends and in vitro transcribed with MAXI-scripts (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). The probes for RPA2 were 5′-UTR (−300 to −1), ORF (+1 to +813), 3′-UTR (+814 to +1427), and 3′-UTR + poly(A) (30Gray N.K. Coller J.M. Dickson K.S. Wickens M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4723-4733Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The probes for thioredoxin were 5′-UTR + ORF (−98 to +318), ORF (+1 to +318), 3′-UTR + ORF + poly(A) (30Gray N.K. Coller J.M. Dickson K.S. Wickens M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4723-4733Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), 3′-UTR (+319 to +455), and 3′-UTR + poly(A) (30Gray N.K. Coller J.M. Dickson K.S. Wickens M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4723-4733Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), full-length (−98 to +485). All DNA fragments were gel-purified and in vitro transcribed into RNA as described above and used for Northwestern blot analyses. Recombinant A18 hnRNP and nucleolin were coated in Nunc-Immuno tubes (immunotubes) (Nalgen Nunc International, Rochester, NY) at a concentration of 40 μg/ml in carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, overnight at 4 °C. As a negative control, bovine serum albumin (BSA) with the same concentration or buffer alone was used. The tubes were washed twice with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and washed two more times with PBS. Nonspecific sites were blocked with 2% milk in PBS containing 2 μg/ml yeast tRNA for 1 h at room temperature. The tubes were washed 3 times with PBS and 3 times with RNA binding buffer (RBB, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol). Labeled TAR RNA (106 cpm) was incubated in the immunotubes with 1 ml of RBB containing 100 units of RNase inhibitor and 2 μg of yeast tRNA. After incubation for 2 h at room temperature, the tubes were washed 10 times with 1 ml of RBB and 5 times with 1 ml of PBS. Bound RNA was then eluted stepwise with 1 ml of RBB containing either 500 mm, 1 m, or 2m NaCl. Aliquots (100 μl) of each elution fraction were counted, and binding specificity was obtained by subtracting the BSA-coated tubes counts from the A18 hnRNP-coated tubes counts. Human colon carcinoma (RKO) cells were irradiated with UV at a dose of 20 J/m2. Two hours later the cells were harvested, and the mRNA was prepared by acid phenol extraction as described previously (13Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Ten μg of mRNA were incubated in the immunotube coated with A18 hnRNP at room temperature and mixed gently by inversion for 2 h. The tube was then washed 10 times with 1 ml of RBB and 5 times with 1 ml of PBS to remove the unbound mRNA. After the last wash, the bound mRNA was eluted stepwise with 1 ml of RBB containing either 500 mm, 1 m, or 2 m NaCl. The eluted mRNA was precipitated with ethanol and used for cDNA synthesis. The first strand cDNA was synthesized using the SmartII cDNA synthesis oligo (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and superscript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The reaction was performed in 20 μl at 42 °C for 1 h. Five μl of the reaction mixture was used to amplify the double strand cDNA by long distance PCR using SmartII cDNA PCR amplification oligo (CLONTECH). PCR was performed for 30 cycles at 95 °C for 1 min, 65 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 6 min. The amplified cDNA was purified, ligated to pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI), and transformed into E. coli DH5α. Positives colonies were picked for further analysis by PCR fingerprinting and sequencing. Sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems 373 (ABI, Foster City, CA) automated sequencer. Northwestern blots were performed essentially as previously described (7Carrier F. Gatignol A. Hollander M.C. Jeang K.T. Fornace Jr., A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1554-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). RNase protection was performed using the ribonuclease protection kit RPAII (Ambion). Briefly, total RNA was prepared from the cells co-transfected with A18 hnRNP and the CAT reporter gene constructs. A 100-base pair fragment upstream of the stop codon of the CAT open reading frame was in vitro transcribed into the complement RNA probe and purified. For each reaction, 20 μg of total RNA was co-precipitated with the RNA probe (2 × 104 cpm for 1 h) and hybridized overnight at 42 °C. For control, 20 μg of yeast RNA was co-precipitated with the RNA probes. The hybridized RNA probe was digested with RNase A/T and precipitated. Protected RNA was separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel. The A18 hnRNP was originally cloned by hybridization subtraction on the basis of rapid induction after UV radiation (8Fornace Jr., A.J. Alamo Jr., I. Hollander M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8800-8804Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Since then, the human gene has been cloned and shown also to be UV-inducible (10Sheikh M.S. Carrier F. Papathanasiou M.A. Hollander M.C. Zhan Q., Yu, K. Fornace Jr., A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26720-26726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Because some hnRNPs are known to shuttle between cell compartments either constitutively (14Krecic A.M. Swanson M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar) or in response to stress (15van der Houven van Oordt W. Diaz-Meco M.T. Lozano J. Krainer A.R. Moscat J. Caceres J.F. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), we evaluated the cellular location of A18 hnRNP after UV radiation. To follow A18 hnRNP protein in the RKO cells, we fused the A18 hnRNP protein to GFP and established a stable cell line with the recombinant expression vector. Our data (Fig. 1) indicate that most cells have incorporated the fused protein and distinctly show that A18 hnRNP is a nuclear protein (panel B). Overexpression of A18 hnRNP in the absence of stress does not affect cellular growth or induce apoptosis (data not shown). Three hours after exposure to UV radiation (20 J/m2), the protein becomes clearly visible in the cytoplasm of many cells (panel D). Cytoplasmic mRNAs are thus likely to be targeted by the RNA-binding protein A18 hnRNP after UV exposure. To identify A18 hnRNP potential mRNAs targets, we developed an affinity binding technique with immunotubes. We first optimized the RNA binding conditions for A18 hnRNP in immunotubes by using a labeled TAR RNA probe. This probe was selected based on its high affinity for stress-activated RNA-binding proteins (7Carrier F. Gatignol A. Hollander M.C. Jeang K.T. Fornace Jr., A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1554-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To evaluate the extent of nonspecific binding, we treated four tubes in parallel. For controls, one tube was left uncoated to estimate the nonspecific binding of RNA to the tube walls, and one tube was coated with BSA to determine the specificity of the RNA-protein interaction. The last two tubes were coated with either the recombinant A18 hnRNP protein or nucleolin, another RNA-binding protein known for its specific binding to stem loop RNA structure (16Ghisolfi-Nieto L. Joseph G. Puvion-Dutilleul F. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 34-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The data presented in Fig. 2 indicate that, under all the elution conditions used, the amount of RNA bound nonspecifically to BSA or the tube walls was less than 20% of the RNA bound to either A18 hnRNP or nucleolin. To make sure that we had eluted all the protein-bound RNA, we treated the tubes with proteinase K. As shown in Fig. 2 (lanes 17–20), proteinase K treatment released some RNA in all the tubes but in much smaller amounts than the salt treatment. These data indicate that under the conditions used most RNAs that are specifically bound to an RNA-binding protein can be eluted. The immunotube technique is thus a suitable and selective technique to identify the potential targets of a given RNA-binding protein. We then repeated this technique with a newly coated A18 hnRNP immunotube and 10 μg of mRNAs isolated from UV-irradiated RKO cells. Because the RKO cells contain several RBP that can be activated by genotoxic stress (7Carrier F. Gatignol A. Hollander M.C. Jeang K.T. Fornace Jr., A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1554-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we reasoned that UV-irradiated RKO cells could be a good source of mRNA targets for A18 hnRNP. After incubation of the UV-treated mRNAs with the A18 hnRNP-coated tube, the specifically bound mRNAs were precipitated, reverse-transcribed, and amplified by PCR. The resulting amplicons were cloned and digested with the four-base cutter HaeIII (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) to evaluate redundancy. Based on this analysis we have determined that several genes were present more than once in the library. Sequencing was performed randomly on non-redundant clones by an automated sequencer. The partial sequences were compared with GenBankTM and EST data bases through the BLAST search engine. As shown in Table I, three main classes of transcripts representing 46 different clones have been identified. A large proportion (∼40%) of these genes are UV- or stress-responsive. This indicates that the technique is highly selective.Table ImRNAs selected by A18 hnRNPRibosomal proteinsStress-responsive proteinsOthersL3Replication protein A2 (43)18 S rRNAL5 (20)Thioredoxin (38)Novel sequence 1L10 (21)Ferritin L chain (41)Sequence of unknown functionL13A (24)Nucleophosmin (44)HistoneL15Glutathione transferase Ω (45)USF1 geneL17Translational elongation factor 1α (46)cctd1-aChaperonin containing T-complex.L19 (36)TIM1-bTranslocase of inner mitochondrial membrane. 22 homolog (47)HSPC023 mRNAL29Cyclophilin B (48)Novel sequence 2L30NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (49)Hypothetical protein FLJ20420L32Human Wilm's tumor related (50)Tubulin-αS3aMyosin regulatory light chain (51)Cystein-glycine-rich protein CSRP2S5Laminin-binding protein (52)S6 (23)Human G10 homolog edg-2 (53)S8Translational elongation factor 1β2 (46)S11Protein kinase C inhibitor I (54)S12Putative C-myc-responsive (rcl) (55)S13 (22)ATPase (56)TAXREB1071-cDNA-binding protein.

Open table in a new tab References for stress-responsive proteins are given in parentheses. Four of these genes, RPA2, thioredoxin, ferritin, and nucleophosmin, are either UV-inducible or UV-responsive (17Iftode C. Daniely Y. Borowiec J.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 34: 141-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). We also verified the specificity of the mRNAs selected by attempting to amplify by reverse transcription-PCR other transcripts known to be UV-inducible. Transcripts for the growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible geneGADD45 and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (1Fornace Jr., A.J. Jackman J. Hollander M.C. Hoffman-Liebermann B. Liebermann D.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 663: 139-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) were not found in the pool of mRNAs selected by A18 hnRNP under these conditions. Another major class of transcripts bound by A18 hnRNP encodes ribosomal proteins. This large number of ribosomal proteins is in good agreement with the increasing body of evidence indicating that translation is an important component of the cellular stress response (18Sheikh M.S Fornace Jr., A.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6121-6128Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Several type of stress, including heat shock stress and several chemicals, can induce the synthesis of stress proteins while inhibiting the rate of protein synthesis (Ref. 19Duncan R.F. Hershey J.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 256: 651-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar and references within). Stress-induced changes in the stoichiometry of ribosomal proteins may trigger an adaptive response by allowing the translation of a specific set of proteins (20Bertram J. Palfner K. Hiddemann W. Kneba M. Eur. J. Cancer. 1998; 34: 731-736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Three of the ribosomal proteins identified in our screen, L10, S13, and L19, have been associated with the oxidative stress response (21Mendez-Alvarez S. Rufenacht K. Eggen R.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 953-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 22Dubnau E. Soares S. Huang T.J. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Gene. 1996; 170: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). L5 is involved in cellular resistance to general stress stimulus (20Bertram J. Palfner K. Hiddemann W. Kneba M. Eur. J. Cancer. 1998; 34: 731-736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and S6 is induced by cold shock (23Graumann P. Schroder K. Schmid R. Marahiel M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4611-4619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). L13 has been suggested as a mediator of the stress induction of the sigma (B) factor in bacteria (24Scott J.M. Ju J. Mitchell T. Haldenwang W.G. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2771-2777Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These data support the idea that our technique is highly selective and that A18 hnRNP specifically targets transcripts involved in the stress response. We do not know whether the other ribosomal proteins identified in our screen play a direct or indirect role in the stress response. Nevertheless, A18 hnRNP may contribute to modulate an adaptive response to cellular stress by targeting specific sets of ribosomal protein transcripts. Other genes encoding a variety of transcripts were also identified. Among these, two encode new sequences, one of unknown function and one that encodes a hypothetical protein. Binding of A18 hnRNP to the 18 S rRNA is also of interest since this rRNA is part of the 40 S ribosomal small subunit. Binding to this rRNA may thus indicate a potential role for A18 hnRNP in translation. Based on sequence analysis we have determined that the 18 S rRNA sequence bound to A18 hnRNP corresponds to nucleotides 706–1385 of the 18 S rRNA (data not shown). This sequence is located in the central domain of the 18 S rRNA and is thought to be involved in eIF3 interaction, which prevents premature association of the large and small ribosomal subunits (25Melander Y. Holmberg L. Nygard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3254-3258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). A potential role in translation regulation is also supported by the binding of A18 hnRNP to the transcripts of two translational elongation factors (1α and 1β2). Our immunotube technique revealed that A18 hnRNP binds to a large number of stress-responsive transcripts (Table I). To determine the binding specificity of A18 hnRNP, we performed Northwestern analyses with RPA2 and thioredoxin, two stress-responsive transcripts identified in our screen (Table I). RPA2 and thioredoxin were selected for this assay based on their UV responsiveness and their well established role in the stress response. The RPA2 protein is important for DNA replication and nucleotide excision repair and is specifically phosphorylated after exposure to UV radiation (17Iftode C. Daniely Y. Borowiec J.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 34: 141-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). RPA2 is also implicated in UV-induced replication arrest (17Iftode C. Daniely Y. Borowiec J.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 34: 141-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Thioredoxin is a UV-inducible protein involved in transcriptional processes such as induction of AP-1 activity and the inhibition of NF-κB activation (26Powis G. Mustacich D. Coon A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 312-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Thioredoxin has also been associated with tumor growth and is now becoming a new target for anti-cancer drugs (26Powis G. Mustacich D. Coon A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 312-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). We first constructed four overlapping probes with the RPA2 transcript (Fig. 3 A) and hybridized them to increasing amounts of recombinant A18 hnRNP protein (Fig. 3 B). Our data indicate that A18 hnRNP does not bind to RPA2 ORF or the 5′-UTR. On the other hand, A18 hnRNP binds very strongly to RPA2 3′-UTR irrespective of the presence of the poly(A) tail. Binding is detectable with as little as 200 ng of recombinant protein (Fig. 3 B, lanes 2). We also repeated a similar experiment with the thioredoxin transcript (Fig. 4). Six different overlapping probes were generated (Fig. 4 A). Our data (Fig. 4 B) indicate that again A18 hnRNP does not bind to the ORF of the transcript and binds only weakly to the 5′-UTR. However, in this case, binding is reinforced by the presence of the transcript poly(A) tail. Interestingly, binding appears to be more sensitive in the presence of the ORF even though A18 hnRNP does not bind to it. The presence of the ORF may affect the overall structure of the RNA and increase binding. These data con"

The nuclear proteins cAMP response element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP) and Mastermind-like-1 strongly colocalize only to NI formed by full-length ataxin-3, whereas the splicing factor SC35 colocalizes only to NI formed by a polyQ-containing, carboxyl-terminal fragment of ataxin-3. These differences in NI formation reflect specific protein interactions normally undertaken by ataxin-3, as both normal and mutant full-length ataxin-3 co-immunoprecipitate with CBP and sediment on density gradients as macromolecular complexes. Moreover, normal ataxin-3 represses cAMP response element-binding protein-mediated transcription, indicating a functional consequence of ataxin-3 interactions with CBP. Finally, we show that mutant ataxin-3 forms insoluble intranuclear complexes, or microaggregates, before NI can be detected, implying a precursor-product relationship.

Orr H.T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). Although the precise mechanism of neurotoxicity remains unknown, growing evidence suggests that polyQ diseases share certain pathogenic features. Protein misfolding, in particular, is thought to play a central role in most, if not all, polyQ diseases (2Scherzinger E. Lurz R. Turmaine M. Mangiarini L. Hollenbach B. Hasenbank R. Bates G.P.

Sci. 1999; 24: 58-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). As a group, these diseases are characterized by abnormal accumulation or aggregation of the disease protein in neurons. In many polyQ diseases, these abnormal protein accumulations occur primarily in the nucleus and are known as nuclear inclusions (NI) (4Ross C.A. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1147-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 5Paulson H.L. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 339-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). However, despite their shared features, polyQ diseases are clinically and pathologically distinct. Only certain brain regions and neuronal populations degenerate in each disease, differing from one disease to the next (e.g. striatal projection neurons in Huntington disease, motor neurons in Kennedy disease). This selective neurodegeneration occurs despite widespread expression of the various disease proteins, implying that the unique protein composition of each expanded polyQ protein plays an important role in specifying the details of pathogenesis. This view is supported by studies showing that expanded polyQ, if removed from its normal protein context, aggregates and displays cytotoxicity but does not fully replicate specific features of disease (6Davies S.W.

In contrast, full-length disease protein has successfully been used in some transgenic animals to model certain disease-specific features and may be more selectively neurotoxic than isolated polyQ fragments (8Burright E.N.

A unifying feature among polyQ diseases is the formation of intracellular inclusions in the cytoplasm, the nucleus (NI), or both. NI are found in most polyQ diseases, occurring in different brain regions depending upon the disease. Although NI may not be directly toxic structures (11Klement I.A. Skinner P.J. Kaytor M.D. Yi H.

Sampat R.M. Kopito R.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1833) Google Scholar). Irrespective of the role of NI in disease, nuclear localization of the mutant polyQ protein is essential for the pathogenesis of at least some polyQ diseases (11Klement I.A. Skinner P.J.

Thus, there is considerable interest in identifying aberrant interactions between polyQ disease proteins and resident nuclear proteins. Transcription factors and cofactors represent one important class of nuclear proteins, many of which contain glutamine-rich or polyQ domains that may form aberrant intermolecular interactions with expanded polyQ. Several such proteins are now known to interact with specific polyQ disease proteins or be recruited to NI, and recent studies in cellular and animal models suggest that transcriptional dysregulation contributes to pathogenesis (17Perez M.K.

CBP serves as a coactivator for many diverse transcription factors (27Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); hence, its sequestration in NI could have far-reaching consequences for affected neurons. In cellular models, recruitment of CBP to inclusions correlates with decreased transcription of a CBP-dependent reporter gene and polyQ toxicity can be mitigated by overexpressing CBP (20McCampbell A. Taylor J.P. Taye A.A. Robitschek J. Li M. Walcott J. Merry D. Chai Y. Paulson H. Sobue G. Fischbeck K.H. Hum. Mol.

Here we address the role of protein context in polyQ disease, focusing on how the protein composition surrounding polyQ influences inclusion formation and recruitment of resident nuclear proteins. For these studies, we use as a model the polyQ disease protein in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3/Machado Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD). The most common dominantly inherited ataxia, SCA3/MJD is characterized by degeneration in the basal ganglia, brainstem, and cerebellum (28Kawaguchi Y. Okamoto T. Taniwaki M. Aizawa M. Inoue M. Katayama H. Nakamura S. Nishimura M. Akiguchi I. Kimura J. Narumiya S. Kakizuka A. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1565) Google Scholar). The SCA3/MJD disease protein, ataxin-3, is the smallest identified polyQ disease protein. It is found in the cytoplasm and/or the nucleus of diverse cell types, and its function is unknown (28Kawaguchi Y. Okamoto T. Taniwaki M. Aizawa M. Inoue M. Katayama H. Nakamura S. Nishimura M.

The glutamine repeat of ataxin-3, which lies near the carboxyl terminus, is normally less than 42 repeats and becomes expanded in disease to 60 repeats or greater. In disease brain, mutant ataxin-3 accumulates in NI in several brainstem neuronal populations (32Paulson H.L. Perez M.K. Trottier Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Subramony S.H. Das S.S. Vig P. Mandel J.L.

In studies comparing the intranuclear behavior of full-length and truncated ataxin-3, we demonstrate that protein composition plays a significant role in specifying the constituent proteins of NI. We also provide evidence that these differences in NI formation reflect specific protein-protein interactions normally undertaken by full-length ataxin-3, including with CBP. Further studies of the interaction of CBP with ataxin-3 show, unexpectedly, that this interaction occurs independent of the polyQ domain of CBP, implying that recruitment to NI is not mediated primarily by intermolecular polyQ-polyQ interactions. Finally, we address an important and controversial issue in the field: the relationship between intranuclear aggregation and NI formation. We demonstrate that the intranuclear formation of insoluble complexes, or microaggregates, of mutant ataxin-3 precedes the appearance of NI, suggesting a precursor-product relationship between the biochemical process of aggregation and the cellular process of inclusion formation. The ataxin-3 expression constructs pcDNA3-hemagglutinin (HA)-Q27, pcDNA3-HA-Q78, pcDNA3-myc-ataxin-3 (Q28), and pcDNA3-myc-ataxin-3 (Q84) were described previously (32Paulson H.L. Perez M.K.

Ataxin-1 was detected with polyclonal anti-octapeptide (Flag) antibody (1:500) (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). CBP was detected with monoclonal CBP antibody (C1, 1:100) and PML with monoclonal PML antibody (1:50) (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology).

Aggregates were scored as cytoplasmic or nuclear aggregates based on 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining of nuclei. Aggregates falling within the range of DAPI staining were designated nuclear, whereas aggregates abutting or clearly outside the range of DAPI were designated cytoplasmic. Samples were scanned with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope using a 63× plan-Apochromat oil objective. For triple immunofluorescence staining, fluorescein, rhodamine, or Cy5 dye was excited by laser light at a 488-, 543-, or 633-nm wavelength, respectively. Each fluorophore was scanned independently using the multitracking function of the LSM 510 unit. In triple staining, goat polyclonal PML antibody (N-19, 1:500) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used to detect PML. For secondary antibodies (all from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA), donkey anti-rabbit fluorescein (1:1,000) was used to label polyQ proteins, donkey anti-mouse rhodamine (1:1000) for SC-35, and donkey anti-goat Cy5 (1:1,000) for PML. HeLa cells were replated into 100-mm dishes the day before transfection with the indicated expression vectors. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were washed twice with ice-cold buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), then solubilized in nondenaturing radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) supplemented with 200 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 230 μm leupeptin, and 5 μm pepstatin A. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at maximum speed in a tabletop centrifuge, and 300-μl samples of supernatant (containing equal amounts of protein) were rotated overnight at 4 °C with the indicated antibody or corresponding preimmune/nonimmune serum and 50 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation, and the protein A-agarose beads were washed four times with 700 μl of lysis buffer. Agarose beads were then mixed with SDS-gel sample buffer, incubated 15 min at room temperature, and spun down briefly. Eluted samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred for immunoblot analysis as described previously (34Chai Y. Koppenhafer S. Shoesmith S. Perez M. Paulson H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Electrophoretically separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, blocked 1 h in blocking solution (5% nonfat powdered milk, 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline), and incubated 2 h with antibody specific for the expected co-precipitated protein. Ataxin-3 was detected with monoclonal ataxin-3 antibody 1H9 (1:2,000; kindly provided by Y. Trottier, Strasbourg, France), polyclonal myc antibody (1:1,000), or monoclonal Flag antibody (M2) (1:1,000; Sigma). CBP, PML, and Mastermind-like-1 protein (MAML1) were detected with polyclonal CBP antibody (A22) (1:5,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), monoclonal PML antibody (1:1,000), and monoclonal Flag antibody (M2). At the specified times after transfection, HeLa cells expressing myc-ataxin-3 (Q28) or myc-ataxin-3 (Q84) were separated into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions as described previously (31Perez M.K.

For sucrose gradient analysis, 400–500 μl of nondenatured cell lysate was loaded on 5–30% sucrose gradients (total gradient volume, 13 ml) generated in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.75 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and centrifuged at 4 °C in a Beckman Vti 65.1 vertical rotor for 2 h at 50,000 rpm (38Ervasti J.M. Kahl S.D. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9161-9165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After centrifugation, 14 fractions (0.9 ml each) were collected starting from the top, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot. Simultaneous analysis of specific marker proteins from parallel gradients or of total cellular proteins from the test gradients (assessed by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels on which fraction were analyzed) showed consistent and reproducible velocity sedimentation from experiment to experiment. The ataxin-3 was detected with polyclonal myc antibody. Histone was detected with monoclonal histone antibody (1:200;Roche Molecular Biochemicals). NFB42 was detected with polyclonal NFB42 antibody (1:2,000; kindly provided by Dr. Randall Pittman, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). 20 S proteasome core was detected with polyclonal 20 S proteasome core antibody (1:5,000; AFFINITI, Exeter, United Kingdom). HeLa cells in 24-well dishes were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus as recommended by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). Each well was transfected with a constant amount of DNA containing firefly reporter plasmids pCRE-Luc (25 ng), Renilla reporter plasmids pRL-TK (2.5 ng), pCREB (100 ng) with 100 ng of empty vector (pFlag-CMV-2), encoding pFlag-ataxin-3 (Q28) or pFlag-ataxin-3 (Q84) to test CREB-dependent transcriptional activation. We also tested Gal-4-CBP-mediated transcription by using Gal4-Luc (25 ng), pRL-TK (2.5 ng), Gal-4-CBP (100 ng) with 100 ng of empty vector (pFlag-CMV-2), pFlag-ataxin-3 (Q28), or pFlag-ataxin-3 (Q84). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity using a Dual-Luciferase™ reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) with an analytical luminescence laboratory Monolight 2010 luminometer. In all experiments, firefly luciferase activity was normalized toRenilla luciferase activity. Statistical analysis was performed using the paired t test, with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. We recently reported that CBP was recruited to NI formed by mutant ataxin-3 (20McCampbell A. Taylor J.P. Taye A.A. Robitschek J. Li M. Walcott J. Merry D. Chai Y. Paulson H. Sobue G. Fischbeck K.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2197-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Recruitment of CBP and many other nuclear proteins to NI may be mediated, in part, by direct interactions between expanded polyQ and glutamine-rich domains within these nuclear proteins (17Perez M.K.

Thus, we tested whether CBP could also be recruited to NI formed by a truncated ataxin-3 fragment consisting of just the COOH-terminal polyQ domain (HA-Q78). To test this, we transfected HeLa cells with full-length or truncated ataxin-3 and then performed immunofluorescence staining. When visualized by standard epifluorescence (Fig. 1 A), CBP strongly colocalized to NI formed by full-length mutant ataxin-3 but was barely detectable in NI formed by truncated ataxin-3. NI formed by a second, unrelated polyQ disease protein, the SCA1 disease protein ataxin-1, also showed surprisingly weak colocalization of CBP. Confocal microscopy (Fig. 1 B) confirmed this differential recruitment of CBP to NI; CBP colocalized nearly quantitatively to NI formed by full-length ataxin-3, but only poorly to NI formed by truncated ataxin-3 and weakly to NI formed by full-length ataxin-1 (and even then, only into a small subset of NI formed by ataxin-1). Identical results were found in differentiated PC12 neural cells; full-length ataxin-3 showed nearly quantitative recruitment of CBP, whereas truncated ataxin-3 and full-length ataxin-1 did not (data not shown). Thus, the differential localization of CBP to NI appears to depend on the nature of the aggregating disease protein rather than on the cell type. This differential recruitment of proteins to NI presumably reflects differences in the protein composition surrounding expanded polyQ. To further address this, we examined the relationship of NI to various subnuclear domains, using antibodies specific for particular resident nuclear proteins. The mRNA splicing factor SC-35, which normally exists in a speckled nuclear pattern (40Fu X.D. Maniatis T. Nature. 1990; 343: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar), colocalized only to NI formed by truncated ataxin-3 and not by full-length ataxin-3 or ataxin-1 (Fig. 2). In contrast, the promyelocytic leukemia antigen (PML), a major protein component of PML nuclear bodies (41Hodges M. Tissot C. Howe K. Grimwade D. Freemont P.S. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 63: 297-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), colocalized to all types of NI, whether formed by full-length ataxin-3, truncated ataxin-3 or full-length ataxin-1. However, the pattern of PML colocalization differed among NI. Whereas PML distributed uniformly throughout NI formed by full-length ataxin-3, it became concentrated along the periphery of NI formed by ataxin-1. The specific localization of SC-35 to NI formed by truncated ataxin-3 prompted us to test whether another protein implicated in mRNA splicing, YT-521B, also colocalize"

https://openalex.org/W2027441347,"Neurotensin (NT), a neuropeptide released in the gastrointestinal tract in response to several stimuli, is involved in the pathophysiology of colonic inflammation. However, the molecular mechanism(s) mediating this proinflammatory response remains unclear. We found that NCM460, non-transformed human colonocytes, express a functional high affinity NT receptor that mediates NT-induced Erk activation. By using NCM460 cells stably transfected with NTR1, we show that NTR1 activation leads to interleukin (IL)-8 secretion that is mediated via both NF-κB- and Erk-dependent pathways. In addition, NT-stimulated NF-κB activation is dependent on intracellular calcium release. NT-stimulated Erk activity requires Ras activation because overexpression of the dominant negative Ras mutant Ras-17N almost completely inhibits the Erk activation. Furthermore, NT directly stimulates Ras-GTP formation as shown by a Ras-GTP pull-down assay. By using reporter gene constructs containing targeted substitutions in the IL-8 promoter, we show that the NF-κB, AP-1, and to a lesser degree the C/EBP sites in the IL-8 promoter region are required for IL-8 gene expression induced by NT. In summary, our results demonstrate that NT stimulates calcium-dependent NF-κB and Ras-dependent Erk pathways that mediate the release of IL-8 from non-transformed human colonocytes. We speculate that these NT-related proinflammatory pathways are important in the pathophysiology of colonic inflammation."

In addition, the ability of both the nonedited isoform (INI) and the fully edited isoform (VGV) to dynamically regulate rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton downstream of G13 activation was examined.DISCUSSIONThe original ternary complex model states that the ligand, the receptor, and the G-protein must interact to form a ternary complex in order to elicit second messenger production. However, recent revisions have occurred to accommodate the finding that some receptors have the ability to promote productive G-protein coupling in the absence of an agonist, termed constitutive activity (27Samama P.

The extended ternary complex model predicts that receptors have the capacity to spontaneously isomerize from an inactive conformation, termed R, to an active state, R*, with the R* version of the receptor having the ability to interact with and activate G-proteins. A relatively large proportion of the nonedited 5-HT2CR exists in a G-protein-coupled state in the absence of agonist (23Barker E.L. Westphal R.S. Schmidt D. Sanders-Bush E. J. Biol.

Furthermore, this high level of constitutive activity is progressively eliminated by RNA editing, with the INI receptor being most efficacious at G-protein coupling, the VSV isoform being intermediate, and VGV receptors existing predominantly in the uncoupled state (present results; see Refs. 5Niswender C.M.

Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 859-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The current results obtained in the R-SAT assay are in agreement, demonstrating decreased agonist potencies for the edited isoforms (INI > VSV > VGV). The extended ternary complex model predicts that raising the concentration of a Gα subunit that productively interacts with the R* configuration (thereby increasing R*G) would increase agonist potency because agonists preferentially bind R*. Conversely, this model also predicts that the potencies of inverse agonists to reverse constitutive activity will decrease as the fraction of R*G increases (32Egan C. Grinde E. Dupre A. Roth B.L. Hake M. Teitler M. Herrick-Davis K. Synapse. 2000; 35: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In agreement with these predictions, we observed that the addition of Gq and G11 subunits to cells expressing the VGV isoform shifted 5-HT dose-response curves leftward (i.e.increased 5-HT potency), compared with receptor alone. Co-expression of Gq with the VSV isoform caused an increase in 5-HT potency, while co-expression of other Gα subunits (including G11) did not cause a significant shift in the 5-HT concentration-response curve. Previous work has shown that co-expressing these G-proteins with other monoamine receptors in the R-SAT assay can shift agonist potency (16Burstein E.S. Spalding T.A. Brann M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24322-24327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 18Burstein E.S. Brauner-Osborne H. Spalding T.A. Conklin B.R. Brann M.R. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 525-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar),2 suggesting that there would be a shift in 5-HT potency if the 5-HT2CR could efficiently couple to these Gα subunits. Consistent with predictions of the effects of increasing [Gα] on inverse agonist potency, we observed a rightward shift in ritanserin dose-response curves (i.e. a decrease in inverse agonist potency) at the INI and VSV receptor with Gqco-transfection. These results are the first experimental evidence that increasing [Gα] can decrease inverse agonist potency. In contrast, ritanserin potency actually increased significantly when G13 and G15 were co-transfected with INI but not with the VSV isoform. This provided an initial suggestion of a functional interaction between G13 and G15subunits and the INI isoform but not the VSV isoform. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that the INI isoform has the ability to activate Gq, G13, and G15, whereas the edited VSV and VGV receptor isoforms can efficiently activate only the Gq family of G-proteins.G12/13 proteins, isolated as oncogenes and cloned by homology to other G-proteins, have been unique in their failure to regulate known Gα effectors such as adenylyl cyclase or phospholipases (reviewed in Ref. 39Dhanasekaran N. Dermott J.M. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), although these G-proteins have been shown to mediate rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton (31Gohla A. Offermanns S. Wilkie T.M. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17901-17907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Therefore, to confirm the apparent alteration in G13coupling exhibited by edited 5-HT2CR isoforms, we examined the ability of the 5-HT2CR isoforms to modulate the actin cytoskeleton. These studies demonstrate that the INI receptor has the ability to promote actin cytoskeleton rearrangement via activation of G13, whereas the VGV receptor isoform does not. Importantly, these data confirm the R-SAT results suggesting an alteration in the ability of edited isoforms to activate G13. This differential ability of the 5-HT2CR edited isoforms to promote actin polymerization has important implications in the brain, where neurotransmission is dynamically regulated by cytoskeletal rearrangments. Furthermore, the finding that 5-HT2CR isoforms with three residues altered within the putative second intracellular loop exhibit reduced functional coupling to G13 provides the first evidence of a critical role for the second intracellular loop in coupling to Gα12/13-type proteins.A noteworthy perspective here is that although an acute response to G12/13 activation results in the rapid formation of stress fiber and focal adhesion assemblies, a relatively longer response results in the activation of specific gene expression (40Zohn I.M. Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1415-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The interactions between these different sets of signals may distinguish G12/13 signaling from other signal transduction pathways. Thus, transient activation of G12/13 may be involved in immediate housekeeping responses, such as the regulation of Na+/H+ exchange, stress fiber formation, ion channels, cell volume, and shape changes, while a more sustained level of activation, perhaps mediated by constitutively active receptors, may lead to cell division and differentiation. Detailed temporal and spatial analyses of 5-HT2CR isoform profiles and G-protein signaling differences are needed. For example, the pleiotropic role of the 5-HT2CR as a growth factor during development (41Wang Y. Gu Q. Cynader M.S. Exp. Brain Res. 1997; 114: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and as a regulator of neuronal excitability in mature animals (42Tecott L.H. Sun L.M. Akana S.F. Strack A.M. Lowenstein D.H. Dallman M.F. Julius D. Nature. 1995; 374: 542-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar) may reflect temperospatial differences in RNA editing and subsequent G-protein coupling capacity.Whereas RNA editing has been shown to have profound functional consequences in a number of proteins (43Higuchi M. Maas S. Single F.N. Hartner J. Rozov A. Burnashev N. Feldmeyer D. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Nature. 2000; 406: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 44Melcher T. Maas S. Herb A.

Nature. 1999; 399: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), this is the first report of a change in the pattern of receptor-mediated G-protein activation by RNA editing. As evidenced by both R-SAT data and stress fiber formation, extensively edited isoforms of the 5-HT2CR, created by editing at four or five sites, have lost or greatly attenuated their ability to functionally couple to G13-protein, which may produce functionally distinct signaling patterns in vivo. Thus, RNA editing is a novel mechanism for regulation of the pattern of activation of heterotrimeric G-proteins, molecular switches that control an enormous variety of biological processes. The monoamine 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin; 5-HT)1 interacts with a large family of receptors to induce signal transduction events important in the modulation of neurotransmission (1Sanders-Bush E. Canton H. Bloom F.E. Kupfer D.J. Psychopharmacology: The Fourth Generation of Progress. Raven Press, New York1995: 431-441Google Scholar). The 2C subtype of serotonin receptor (5-HT2CR) is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily and interacts with Gq to stimulate phospholipase C, resulting in the production of inositol phosphates and diacylglycerol (2Chang M. Zhang L. Tam J.P. Sanders-Bush E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7021-7029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). RNA transcripts encoding the human 5-HT2CR undergo adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing events at five positions, termed A, B, C, D, and E (Fig. 1 A), altering the amino acid coding potential within the putative second intracellular loop of the protein (3Burns C.M. Chu H. Rueter S.M. Hutchinson L.K. Canton H. Sanders-Bush E. Emeson R.B. Nature. 1997; 387: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 4Niswender C.M. Sanders-Bush E. Emeson R.B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 861: 38-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We and others have demonstrated a decrease in agonist potency at the human edited VSV and VGV isoforms (named for the amino acids at positions 156, 158, and 160) compared with the nonedited isoform, which codes for INI at these positions. This decrease in agonist potency is reflected as a rightward shift in the dose-response curve for inositol phosphate accumulation (5Niswender C.M. Copeland S.C. Herrick-Davis K. Emeson R.B.

Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 859-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The decreased agonist potency was proposed to result from a reduced Gq-protein coupling efficiency induced by the introduction of these novel amino acids into the second intracellular loop, a region known to be important for G-protein coupling (8Arora K.K.

Co-expression of Gq with the VSV isoform caused an increase in 5-HT potency, while co-expression of other Gα subunits (including G11) did not cause a significant shift in the 5-HT concentration-response curve. Previous work has shown that co-expressing these G-proteins with other monoamine receptors in the R-SAT assay can shift agonist potency (16Burstein E.S. Spalding T.A. Brann M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24322-24327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 18Burstein E.S. Brauner-Osborne H. Spalding T.A. Conklin B.R. Brann M.R. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 525-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar),2 suggesting that there would be a shift in 5-HT potency if the 5-HT2CR could efficiently couple to these Gα subunits. Consistent with predictions of the effects of increasing [Gα] on inverse agonist potency, we observed a rightward shift in ritanserin dose-response curves (i.e. a decrease in inverse agonist potency) at the INI and VSV receptor with Gqco-transfection. These results are the first experimental evidence that increasing [Gα] can decrease inverse agonist potency. In contrast, ritanserin potency actually increased significantly when G13 and G15 were co-transfected with INI but not with the VSV isoform. This provided an initial suggestion of a functional interaction between G13 and G15subunits and the INI isoform but not the VSV isoform. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that the INI isoform has the ability to activate Gq, G13, and G15, whereas the edited VSV and VGV receptor isoforms can efficiently activate only the Gq family of G-proteins.G12/13 proteins, isolated as oncogenes and cloned by homology to other G-proteins, have been unique in their failure to regulate known Gα effectors such as adenylyl cyclase or phospholipases (reviewed in Ref. 39Dhanasekaran N. Dermott J.M. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), although these G-proteins have been shown to mediate rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton (31Gohla A. Offermanns S. Wilkie T.M. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17901-17907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Therefore, to confirm the apparent alteration in G13coupling exhibited by edited 5-HT2CR isoforms, we examined the ability of the 5-HT2CR isoforms to modulate the actin cytoskeleton. These studies demonstrate that the INI receptor has the ability to promote actin cytoskeleton rearrangement via activation of G13, whereas the VGV receptor isoform does not. Importantly, these data confirm the R-SAT results suggesting an alteration in the ability of edited isoforms to activate G13. This differential ability of the 5-HT2CR edited isoforms to promote actin polymerization has important implications in the brain, where neurotransmission is dynamically regulated by cytoskeletal rearrangments. Furthermore, the finding that 5-HT2CR isoforms with three residues altered within the putative second intracellular loop exhibit reduced functional coupling to G13 provides the first evidence of a critical role for the second intracellular loop in coupling to Gα12/13-type proteins.A noteworthy perspective here is that although an acute response to G12/13 activation results in the rapid formation of stress fiber and focal adhesion assemblies, a relatively longer response results in the activation of specific gene expression (40Zohn I.M. Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1415-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The interactions between these different sets of signals may distinguish G12/13 signaling from other signal transduction pathways. Thus, transient activation of G12/13 may be involved in immediate housekeeping responses, such as the regulation of Na+/H+ exchange, stress fiber formation, ion channels, cell volume, and shape changes, while a more sustained level of activation, perhaps mediated by constitutively active receptors, may lead to cell division and differentiation. Detailed temporal and spatial analyses of 5-HT2CR isoform profiles and G-protein signaling differences are needed. For example, the pleiotropic role of the 5-HT2CR as a growth factor during development (41Wang Y. Gu Q. Cynader M.S. Exp. Brain Res. 1997; 114: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and as a regulator of neuronal excitability in mature animals (42Tecott L.H. Sun L.M. Akana S.F. Strack A.M. Lowenstein D.H. Dallman M.F. Julius D. Nature. 1995; 374: 542-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar) may reflect temperospatial differences in RNA editing and subsequent G-protein coupling capacity.Whereas RNA editing has been shown to have profound functional consequences in a number of proteins (43Higuchi M. Maas S. Single F.N. Hartner J. Rozov A. Burnashev N. Feldmeyer D. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Nature. 2000; 406: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 44Melcher T. Maas S. Herb A.

Nature. 1999; 399: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), this is the first report of a change in the pattern of receptor-mediated G-protein activation by RNA editing. As evidenced by both R-SAT data and stress fiber formation, extensively edited isoforms of the 5-HT2CR, created by editing at four or five sites, have lost or greatly attenuated their ability to functionally couple to G13-protein, which may produce functionally distinct signaling patterns in vivo. Thus, RNA editing is a novel mechanism for regulation of the pattern of activation of heterotrimeric G-proteins, molecular switches that control an enormous variety of biological processes. The original ternary complex model states that the ligand, the receptor, and the G-protein must interact to form a ternary complex in order to elicit second messenger production. However, recent revisions have occurred to accommodate the finding that some receptors have the ability to promote productive G-protein coupling in the absence of an agonist, termed constitutive activity (27Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Egan C. Grinde E. Dupre A. Roth B.L. Hake M. Teitler M. Herrick-Davis K. Synapse. 2000; 35: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The extended ternary complex model predicts that receptors have the capacity to spontaneously isomerize from an inactive conformation, termed R, to an active state, R*, with the R* version of the receptor having the ability to interact with and activate G-proteins. A relatively large proportion of the nonedited 5-HT2CR exists in a G-protein-coupled state in the absence of agonist (23Barker E.L. Westphal R.S. Schmidt D. Sanders-Bush E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11687-11690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Grotewiel M.S. Sanders-Bush E. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1999; 359: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These results were confirmed in the current work using the R-SAT assay. Furthermore, this high level of constitutive activity is progressively eliminated by RNA editing, with the INI receptor being most efficacious at G-protein coupling, the VSV isoform being intermediate, and VGV receptors existing predominantly in the uncoupled state (present results; see Refs. 5Niswender C.M.

The isoform-dependent constitutive activity could have important implications for the physiological effects of 5-HT by controlling basal tone and sensitivity at synaptic sites. In addition, region-specific generation of edited isoforms (3Burns C.M. Chu H. Rueter S.M. Hutchinson L.K. Canton H. Sanders-Bush E. Emeson R.B. Nature. 1997; 387: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar), coupled with reports of altered RNA editing in suicide (36Niswender C.M. Herrick-Davis K. Dilley G.E. Meltzer H.Y.

Makoff A. Kerwin R. Harrison P. Mol. Psychiatry. 2001; 6: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), suggests that the repertoire of expressed edited 5-HT2CRs may contribute to individual differences in brain serotonergic signaling and perhaps even responses to therapeutic agents such as atypical antipsychotic drugs, many of which have been shown to be inverse agonists at the 5-HT2CR (34Weiner D.M. Burstein E.S. Nash N. Croston G.E. Currier E.A. Vanover K.E. Harvey S.C. Donohue E. Hansen H.C. Andersson C.M. Spalding T.A. Gibson D.F. Krebs-Thomson K. Powell S.B. Geyer M.A. Hacksell U. Brann M.R.

Serotonergic agonists exhibit a decreased potency for eliciting inositol phosphate production and calcium release when interacting with the edited receptor isoforms stably expressed in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts (5Niswender C.M.

The current results obtained in the R-SAT assay are in agreement, demonstrating decreased agonist potencies for the edited isoforms (INI > VSV > VGV). The extended ternary complex model predicts that raising the concentration of a Gα subunit that productively interacts with the R* configuration (thereby increasing R*G) would increase agonist potency because agonists preferentially bind R*. Conversely, this model also predicts that the potencies of inverse agonists to reverse constitutive activity will decrease as the fraction of R*G increases (32Egan C. Grinde E. Dupre A. Roth B.L. Hake M. Teitler M. Herrick-Davis K. Synapse. 2000; 35: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).

These findings suggest that the WRN helicase may function in a complex with RPA to resolve replication fork blocks. The substrate specificities and enzymology of the WRN 3′→ 5′-exonuclease has also been characterized. WRN exonuclease initiates digestion from 3′-recessed termini, gaps, and nicks, but displays little or no activity on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), blunt-ended duplexes, or 3′-protruding strands (6Kamath-Loeb A.S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2396-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). WRN exonuclease activity on a duplex blunt end is stimulated by the presence of ssDNA regions in the duplex (31Shen J.C. Loeb L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3260-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In addition, we have previously demonstrated that the WRN 3′ → 5′-exonuclease is stimulated by a physical and functional interaction with the Ku heterodimer of 68 and 83 kDa, whereas Ku does not affect WRN helicase unwinding (32Cooper M.P. Machwe A. Orren D.K. Brosh Jr., R.M. Ramsden D. Bohr V.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 907-912PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence supports an important role for Ku in non-homologous DNA end joining and telomere maintenance (33Featherstone C. Jackson S.P. Mutat. Res. 1999; 434: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), implicating the WRN exonuclease in either or both of these biological processes. WRN is the only human RecQ helicase family member identified thus far that contains an additional 3′ → 5′-exonuclease activity. The biological significance of the WRN exonuclease and helicase activities are not yet known, and it is not clear whether both WRN activities contribute to the same biological process in a coordinated manner. To date, in vitro enzymatic studies of WRN have focused on the exonuclease and helicase activities separately. Thus, the simultaneous action of the WRN exonuclease and helicase on a single substrate has not been investigated. To investigate how the WRN helicase and exonuclease might coordinate, we have examined WRN function on DNA-forked duplexes, which we found serve as substrates for both WRN activities under identical conditions in vitro. These forked duplexes were designed to contain telomeric repeats as a first step to study WRN function in telomere metabolism. We find that the WRN helicase is active at the forked end of the substrate, whereas WRN exonuclease is active at the blunt end of the duplex. The WRN activities appear to act in concert on long forked duplexes. We also have examined the coordinate action of the WRN helicase and exonuclease in the presence of its protein partners, Ku and RPA. The heterotrimer of human RPA (RPA70, RPA32, and RPA14) was a generous gift from Mark Kenny (Albert Einstein Cancer Center, Bronx, NY) and was purified as described previously (34Kenny M.K.

T4 polynucleotide kinase was purchased from New England BioLabs. Recombinant wild type and mutant WRN proteins were purified using a baculovirus/insect cell expression system and contained N-terminal histidine tags to aid in the purification. The baculovirus construct for expression of the K-WRN variant, containing a point mutation in the helicase domain (K577M), was kindly provided by Matthew Gray (University of Washington, Seattle, WA). The baculovirus construct for the expression of the X-WRN variant, containing a point mutation in the exonuclease domain (E84A), was kindly provided by Shurong Huang and Judy Campisi (University of California, Berkeley, CA). Protein production and purification was as described previously (8Orren D.K. Brosh Jr., R.M. Nehlin J.O. Machwe A. Gray M.D. Bohr V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3557-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Purification was achieved by a combination of DEAE-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ), Q-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and Ni-NTA (Qiagen) chromatography. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Oligonucleotides used for substrate preparations were ordered from Midland Certified Reagents Co. (Midland, TX) and were purified by trityl-selective perfusion high pressure liquid chromatography by the manufacturer (Table I). Additional purification of 32P end-labeled oligonucleotides was performed as required using non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and ethanol precipitation. Oligonucleotides were 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer. Labeled oligonucleotides were annealed to the complementary oligonucleotide in a 1:2 molar ratio by incubation in 50 mm LiCl at 95 °C for 5 min followed by cooling to room temperature. LiCl was used to avoid tetraplex formation in the G-rich strand. The duplex region of the forks contained one, two, or four telomeric repeats (TTAGGG) followed by 10 bp of unique sequence, which was included to promote proper alignment of the repeat units in the duplex. Oligonucleotides 1 and 2 were annealed to form a 16-bp forked duplex, oligonucleotides 3 and 4 were annealed to form a 22-bp forked duplex, and oligonucleotides 5 and 6 were annealed to form a 34-bp forked duplex. Oligonucleotides 7 and 8 were annealed to form a duplex blunt at both ends, and oligonucleotides 6 and 7 were annealed to form the duplex with a 3′ single-stranded tail. In all cases the G-rich strand was 5′ end-labeled. An analysis of the substrates by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis confirmed the presence of a single species and the lack of alternate products formed by potential misalignment of the telomere repeats.Table IOligonucleotides used in substrate preparations15′-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTAGGGCATGCACTAC-3′25′-GTAGTGCATGCCCTAATTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′35′-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTAGGGTTAGGGCATGCACTAC-3′45′-GTAGTGCATGCCCTAACCCTAATTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′55′-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGCATGCACTAC-3′65′-GTAGTGCATGCCCTAACCCTAACCCTAACCCTAATTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′75′-TTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGCATGCACTAC-3′85′-GTAGTGCATGCCCTAACCCTAACCCTAACCCTAA-3′ Open table in a new tab Reactions (10–20 μl) were performed in standard reaction buffer (40 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.0, 4 mm MgCl2, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) unless otherwise indicated. In all cases the DNA substrate concentration was 0.5 nm, expressed as substrate molecules. Protein concentrations were as indicated in the figure legends. Reactions were initiated by the addition of WRN and were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, unless otherwise indicated. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 3x stop dye (50 mm EDTA, 40% glycerol, 0.9% SDS, 0.1% bromophenol blue, and 0.1% xylene cyanol) to a 1× final concentration, along with a 10× molar excess of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide. The unlabeled competitor was identical to the labeled strand of the duplex and was added to prevent reannealing of the unwound ssDNA products. For experiments that included RPA and/or Ku70/80, terminated reactions were incubated with proteinase K (8.3 ng/μl final concentration) at 37 °C for 30 min prior to gel electrophoresis. This process disrupted aggregations of protein and DNA complexes that would fail to enter the native gel. Products were run on 12% native polyacrylamide gels, visualized using a PhosphorImager and quantitated using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). The percent of displaced product was quantitated as described previously (28Brosh Jr., R.M. Orren D.K. Nehlin J.O. Ravn P.H. Kenny M.K. Machwe A. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18341-18350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) using the following formula: percent displacement = 100 *P/(total DNA) where P is the amount of displaced strand product. Background correction was carried out using control reactions that excluded the enzyme and included either native or heat-denatured substrate. Reactions were terminated by an addition of equal volume formamide stop dye (80% formamide, 0.5× Tris borate, 0.1% bromophenol blue, and 0.1% xylene cyanol). Products were heat-denatured for 5 min at 95 °C, run on 14% denaturing polyacrylamide gels, and visualized using a PhosphorImager. For kinetic analyses conducted on the 16-bp forked duplex, the amount of radioactivity in each product band was quantitated using ImageQuant software. The proportion of products shortened to each length was determined by dividing the amount of radioactivity in a given product band by the total radioactivity quantitated in the lane. The following formula was used to estimate the amount of nucleotides excised (fmols) that each product band represented: proportion of product length n* fmol total DNA molecules (initial substrate length − product lengthn*). All values were corrected for background in the 0-min lane. Values were summed to estimate total nucleotides excised/time point. The estimated rate of excision was determined by plotting total fmols nucleotides excised versus time and by calculating the slope in the linear range. The rate was normalized for the total fmol of WRN (calculated as a monomer) in the reaction. The forked substrates used in this study contained 15-mer ssDNA tails that formed a “fork” at one end of double-stranded DNA that was blunt at the other end. These substrates contained variable numbers of telomeric repeats in the duplex region. We investigated the substrate structural requirements for WRN activity on a forked duplex. Previous studies showed that WRN unwinding of linear duplex DNA is stimulated by ssDNA tails and requires at least a 3′-ssDNA tail or internal ssDNA region (25Mohaghegh P. Karow J.K. Brosh Jr., R.M. Bohr V.A Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2843-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Similarly, internal ssDNA regions within a duplex substrate stimulated WRN exonuclease activity at the blunt or 3′-recessed end of the substrate (31Shen J.C. Loeb L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3260-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, the ability of ssDNA tails to stimulate WRN 3′ → 5′-exonuclease activity had not been previously demonstrated. Therefore, we tested whether a covalent 3′-ssDNA tail or exogenous ssDNA could stimulate WRN digestion of a blunt-ended duplex (Fig. 1). No WRN exonuclease activity was observed on the blunt-ended substrate, and exogenous single strand DNA failed to stimulate digestion (Fig. 1). However, a substrate containing a blunt end and a 3′-ssDNA tail at the other end was digested by WRN starting from the blunt end in a 3′ → 5′ direction. In contrast, digestion was not observed at the blunt end of the substrate that had a 5′-ssDNA tail instead (data not shown). In summary, our results indicate that a covalently attached 3′-ssDNA tail is sufficient to stimulate WRN exonuclease digestion at a blunt end, suggesting that a forked duplex would also be a substrate for digestion. To examine WRN catalytic activities simultaneously on the forked duplexes, substrates were incubated with increasing amounts of the WRN protein, and reaction products were analyzed on a native gel to display the helicase activity and on denaturing gels to visualize the products of the 3′ → 5′-exonuclease activity. Analysis on native gels indicated that maximal unwinding of the 16- and 22-bp forked duplexes was achieved with 1.9 nm WRN (Fig.2 A). A titration with lower amounts of enzyme revealed that the 16-bp forked duplex was unwound slightly more efficiently than the 22-bp forked duplex (Fig.2 A). The native gels also showed that at higher WRN concentrations, the displaced strand (37-mer) from the 22-bp forked duplex was partially degraded. An analysis of reaction products on denaturing gels revealed that the WRN exonuclease degraded the 5′-labeled strands of both forked duplexes starting from the blunt end (Fig. 2 B). Incubation of the 16-bp forked duplex with increasing concentrations of WRN resulted in shortening of the 31-mer-labeled strand by 1 and 2 nt. The pattern of digestion on the 22-bp forked duplex showed a prominent band representing two nucleotides excised followed by a faint ladder of products (up to 11 nt excised). These data indicated that the length of the duplex influenced both activities of WRN. To further examine the interplay between WRN helicase and exonuclease, we performed the reactions with a longer 34-bp forked duplex. In contrast to the 16- and 22-bp forked duplexes, this substrate was not unwound sufficiently by WRN to displace the 49-mer-labeled strand, even at WRN concentrations as high as 15 nm (Fig.3 A). However, we saw a loss of the duplex and the appearance of bands migrating below the 49-mer marker from reactions with 1.9 nm WRN and above (Fig.3 A). These results suggested that this substrate was refractory to unwinding by the WRN helicase but was susceptible to digestion by the WRN exonuclease. An analysis of the reaction products on a denaturing gel showed a decrease in the labeled 49-mer and an increase in progressively shorter products as a function of WRN concentration (Fig. 3 B). Prominent products corresponded to fragments 39, 32, and 26 nt long. In contrast, when the opposite strand was 5′-labeled and incubated with WRN, a ladder of digestion products was not observed (data not shown). In summary, the extent of WRN exonuclease digestion was greater on a fork that had a longer duplex region (34 bp), which was not unwound by the WRN helicase. In contrast, the exonuclease activity was limited on forks with shorter duplex regions (16 and 22 bp) that were unwound by WRN. In the experiment with the 34-bp forked duplex, we did not see the labeled 49-mer strand on the native gel that should have appeared if the substrate had been unwound. One explanation for this is that the helicase was inhibited during reactions with this substrate, although the WRN exonuclease was clearly active. If this had been true, partial duplex structures (i.e. partially digested labeled strands still hybridized to the unlabeled complement) should have been evident when the reactions were analyzed on a native gel. The prominent 39- and 32-mer products observed on the denaturing gel (Fig. 3 B) would have formed partial duplexes of 24 and 17 bp, respectively, with one forked end and one end with a 5′-ssDNA tail. These products should have been stable under the reaction and electrophoresis conditions according to the previous experiments with the 16- and 22-bp forks (see Fig. 2 A, no enzyme controls) and would have migrated more slowly than the 49-mer product. However, the labeled products at WRN concentrations of 1.9–15 nm migrated as single strand fragments below the 49-mer ssDNA marker on the native gel. This is shown more clearly in Fig. 3 C, in which the products from a reaction with the 34-bp forked duplex and 7.5 nm WRN were electrophoresed with labeled markers that bracketed this size range. These data suggest the appearance of the 39- and 32-mer ssDNA products on the native gel resulted from WRN helicase unwinding (at the forked end) of the shortened duplexes formed by the action of the WRN exonuclease (initiated at the blunt end). Consistent with this finding, the 32- and 39-mer products were not observed when helicase activity was eliminated by using ATPγS (Fig. 3 C, lane 6). Instead, a shorter fragment (21–26 bp in length according to denaturing gel analysis, Fig.4 A, third panel, lane 6) was apparent, most probably because of the WRN exonuclease degrading the substrate to unstable duplex lengths (6–11-bp duplex + 15-mer tail). Therefore, the WRN helicase and exonuclease appeared to function in concert to remove the labeled strand of the 34-bp forked duplex. The above results indicate that the WRN exonuclease progression was greatest on the 34-bp forked duplex and least on the 16-bp forked duplex. In contrast, the WRN helicase efficiently unwound the 16- and 22-bp forked duplexes but did not unwind the full-length 34-bp forked duplex. Our data confirm previous reports that WRN helicase is dependent on duplex length (28Brosh Jr., R.M. Orren D.K. Nehlin J.O. Ravn P.H. Kenny M.K. Machwe A. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18341-18350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), however, the influence of duplex length on the WRN exonuclease has not been previously reported. One explanation for our observations is that the activity of the WRN exonuclease on the different forked duplexes was modulated by the extent of WRN helicase unwinding. To determine the influence of the WRN catalyzed unwinding on the WRN exonuclease function, we measured digestion independently of unwinding activity. We used a WRN variant (K-WRN) that contained a mutation in the ATPase domain (K577M), which abolished helicase activity but not exonuclease activity (4Gray M.D. Shen J.C. Kamath-Loeb A.S. Blank A.

J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18341-18350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). K-WRN digested all the substrates more extensively than wild type (Fig.4 A, lanes designated K). With the wild type enzyme, the shortest detectable products were 29 nt long for the 16-bp forked duplex and 26 nt long for the 22- and 34-bp forked duplexes. Because the ssDNA tails for all forks were 15 nt, this indicated that digestion slowed considerably or stopped 14 bp (16-bp forked duplex) and 11 bp (22- and 34-bp forked duplexes) from the single strand/duplex junction (Fig. 4 A). However, with the helicase mutant (K-WRN), the digestion pattern shifted such that the shortest product was 21 nt, indicating that the exonuclease slowed or stopped 6 bp from the single strand/duplex junction for all three forks (Fig. 4 A). Furthermore, this pattern was reproduced with the wild type enzyme in reactions that either lacked ATP or contained ATPγS (Fig.4 A). Thus, on all three substrates, the presence of an active WRN helicase decreased the extent of WRN exonuclease digestion. To confirm that the exonuclease activity detected in the above experiment is intrinsic to WRN and not due to a potential contaminant in the protein preparation, we repeated the experiment with a WRN variant (X-WRN). This enzyme contained a mutation (E84A) that inactivated the exonuclease activity (5Huang S. Li B. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Mian I.S. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 36Machwe A. Ganunis R. Bohr V.A. Orren D.K.

No exonuclease digestion products were observed when the substrates were incubated with the E84A variant (Fig. 4 A, lanes designated X, and Fig. 4 B). However, the X-WRN helicase unwinds the 16- and 22-bp forked duplex but not the 34-bp forked duplex, similar to wil"

A variety of conditions, such as loss of the ER intraluminal oxidative environment or calcium content or the mutation or overexpression of relatively insoluble proteins, cause accumulation of misfolded proteins within the ER (1Wetzel R. Trends Biotechnol. 1994; 12: 193-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Protein misfolding triggers three compensatory responses. One is the unfolded protein response (UPR), involving increased expression of molecular chaperones such as Grp94 and Grp78/BiP that promote proper protein folding (2Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3602) Google Scholar), as well as SERCA2, an energy-dependent transporter for loading the ER lumen with calcium (3Caspersen C. Pedersen P.S. Treiman M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22363-22372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A second response is the generalized suppression of translation mediated by the serine/threonine kinase PERK, which phosphorylates and inactivates the translation initiation factor eIF2α (4Shi Y. Vattem K.M. Sood R. An J. Liang J. Stramm L. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7499-7509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2533) Google Scholar). A third is ER-associated degradation, in which misfolded proteins are expelled from the ER and targeted for degradation by cytoplasmic proteasomes (6Brodsky J.L. McCracken A.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 151-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 7Lord J.M. Davey J. Frigerio L. Roberts L.M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although these three protective responses control transiently the accumulation of misfolded proteins within the ER, they can be overcome by sustained ER stress, which leads to apoptosis (8Perez-Sala D.

Molecular genetic and pharmacologic experiments have established that cells deficient in the UPR, ER-associated degradation or translational suppression responses are more vulnerable to ER stress-induced apoptosis (10Liu H.

Several potential pathogenic mechanisms have been proposed for presenilin mutations, including impairments in ER stress signaling and increased sensitivity to stress-induced apoptosis. Evidence has been presented that mutant PS-1 enhances ER stress-induced apoptosis by reducing the UPR and PERK-mediated translational suppression not only in the context of overexpressing cell lines but also for primary mouse neurons bearing an AD-linked PS-1 knock-in mutation (13Katayama T. Imaizumi K. Sato N. Miyoshi K. Kudo T. Hitomi J. Morhihara T. Yoneda T. Gomi F. Mori Y. Nakano Y. Takeda J. Tsuda T. Itoyama Y. Murayama O. Takashima A. St. George-Hyslop P. Takeda M. Tohyama M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Reduced responsiveness to ER stress may be particularly germane to AD, because the principal constituent of the insoluble neuritic plaques, the 42-residue amyloid Aβ protein, is synthesized partly in the ER and intermediate compartment (20Annaert W.G. Levesque L Craessaerts K. Dierinck I. Snellings G. Westaway D. Hyslop P.S. Cordell B. Fraser P. De Strooper B. J.

Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2955) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the role of altered ER stress responsiveness as a neuropathogenic mechanism for presenilin mutations is uncertain. Another study failed to demonstrate an involvement of PS-1 or an AD-linked PS-1 mutant in protective responses to ER stress (25Sato N. Urano F. Leem J.Y. Kim S.-H. Li M. Donoviel D. Bernstein A. Lee A.S. Ron D. Veselits M.L. Sisodia S.S. Thinakaran G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Furthermore, signs of ER stress or aberrant apoptosis have not been reported so far for transgenic mouse lines expressing pathogenic presenilin mutations (25Sato N. Urano F. Leem J.Y. Kim S.-H. Li M. Donoviel D. Bernstein A. Lee A.S. Ron D. Veselits M.L. Sisodia S.S. Thinakaran G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 26Price D.L. Tanzi R.E. Borchelt D.R. Sisodia S.S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 461-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Finally, the influence of mutant PS-1 on ER stress-induced apoptotic signal transduction has not been investigated. The signaling pathway that initiates ER stress-induced apoptosis has begun to be defined, and it involves activation of cysteine proteases distinct from those that trigger the widely studied mitochondrial and death receptor apoptotic pathways. ER stress-mediated apoptosis is dependent on an ER-resident cysteine protease, caspase-12 (24Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2955) Google Scholar), for which activation may be regulated by processing of the procaspase-12 zymogen by the calcium-dependent cysteine protease calpain (27Nakagawa T. Yuan J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar) and by zymogen clustering mediated by TRAF2 (28Yoneda T. Imaizumi K. Oono K. Yui D. Gomi F. Katayama T. Tohyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13935-13940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). There are conflicting reports on the role of mitochondrial release of cytochrome c in ER stress-induced apoptosis (29Bitko V. Barik S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 80: 441-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 30Nakamura K. Bossy-Wetzel E. Burns K. Fadel M.P. Lozyk M. Goping I.S. Opas M. Bleackley R.C. Green D.R. Michalak M. J.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2286-2295Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), and little is known about how caspase-12 activity leads to the execution of apoptosis. We describe here the further analysis of the cysteine protease activation responses to ER stress. The study has been carried out in primary cortical neurons and fibroblasts derived from mice, either wild type for PS-1 or homozygous for a pathogenic P264L knock-in mutation in PS-1 (32Siman R. Reaume A.G. Savage M.J. Trusko S. Lin Y.-G. Scott R.W. Flood D.G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8717-8726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After characterizing the activation of calpain and caspases in response to ER stress, we investigated the influences of the mutant PS-1 on proteolysis, apoptosis, and protective responses of UPR and PERK activation. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Neurobasal, trypsin, and B27 supplement were from Life Technologies, Inc. Fetal calf serum was from Hyclone. Tunicamycin, thapsigargin, staurosporine, Hoechst 33342, and soybean trypsin inhibitor were from Sigma. Calpeptin was from Calbiochem. Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde was from Enzyme Systems Products. Supplies for immunoblotting were from DuPont. Horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Biotinylated secondary antibodies and avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex were from Vector. Anti-caspase-12 was a rat monoclonal antibody, generously provided by Drs. T. Nakagawa and J. Yuan (Boston). Anti-caspase-3 was a monoclonal antibody (clone 46) purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-Grp94 and anti-Grp-78/BiP were from Stressgen. Anti-cytochrome c was from PharMingen. Anti-actin (clone 4) was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Anti-active caspase-3 was a rabbit antiserum (Ab206) that reacts selectively with the p17 large subunit, but not with procaspase-3, and was prepared and characterized in this laboratory previously (32Siman R. Reaume A.G. Savage M.J. Trusko S. Lin Y.-G. Scott R.W. Flood D.G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8717-8726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-calpain-cleaved α-spectrin (Ab38) reacts specifically with the ∼150-kDa α-spectrin derivative formed by either calpain I or II but does not react with α-spectrin derivatives produced by caspases or other proteases, and it has been characterized extensively (32Siman R. Reaume A.G. Savage M.J. Trusko S. Lin Y.-G. Scott R.W. Flood D.G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8717-8726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Roberts-Lewis J.M. Savage M.J. Marcy V. Pinsker L. Siman R. J. Neurosci. 1994; 16: 3934-3944Crossref Google Scholar). Anti-PERK was an affinity-purified rabbit antibody generously provided by Dr. Takashi Kudo (Osaka, Japan). An antiserum reactive specifically with the caspase-6-derived NH2-terminal fragment of lamin A (Ab255) was prepared as follows. The hexapeptide corresponding to the COOH terminus of the lamin A fragment (RLVEID) was synthesized along with an NH2-terminal cysteine residue by Research Genetics. It was coupled via its cysteine residue to keyhole limpet hemocyanin using the heterobifunctional coupling agent maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Pierce), and the conjugate was used to immunize rabbits and generate the Ab255 antiserum. Primary cortical neuronal cultures were derived from E17 mice of the 129/CD-1 outbred strain, either wild type for PS-1 or homozygous for the PS-1 P264L knock-in mutation. The latter mouse line was generated by a two-step gene-targeting strategy that first introduced a base change into exon 8 encoding the P264L mutation and subsequently used the Cre-loxP system to remove the drug selection cassette from the upstream intron. This gene-targeting strategy enables the Alzheimer's disease-linked P264L mutation to be introduced into the endogenous mousePS-1 gene, such that the mutant gene is expressed at normal levels and with endogenous regulatory controls over splicing and expression. The derivation and initial phenotypic characterization of these mice, including PS-1 gene expression in the brain, has been described previously (32Siman R. Reaume A.G. Savage M.J. Trusko S. Lin Y.-G. Scott R.W. Flood D.G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8717-8726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dissociated monolayer cultures of essentially pure mouse cortical neurons were established using the serum-free Neurobasal/B27 medium formulation (34Brewer G.J. Torricelli J.R. Evege E.K. Price P.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar) as described previously (32Siman R. Reaume A.G. Savage M.J. Trusko S. Lin Y.-G. Scott R.W. Flood D.G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8717-8726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were plated onto polyornithine/laminin-coated 6-well plates or 100-mm dishes at 60,000 cells/cm2 and maintained for 7–14 days in vitro. Embryonic fibroblasts were cultured from PS-1 wild-type and PS-1 P264L homozygous knock-in mice using conventional procedures. Briefly, E17 embryos were decapitated, eviscerated, and minced into small pieces. Cells were dissociated by trypsinization followed by passage through narrow-tip pipettes; large clumps were removed, and the remaining cells were plated onto plastic dishes at 5 × 104 cells/cm2 in medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum. Nonadherent cells were discarded after 1 h, and the medium was replaced every second day thereafter. When near confluency, fibroblasts were replated using mild trypsinization. Experiments were performed on secondary fibroblasts grown to ∼50% confluency. Cultures were treated with the indicated agents for time periods ranging from 1 to 24 h. For immunoblotting, cultures were rinsed once with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, 2.5 mm EDTA and solubilized in prewarmed SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Polypeptides were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene membranes, and immunostained as described previously (32Siman R. Reaume A.G. Savage M.J. Trusko S. Lin Y.-G. Scott R.W. Flood D.G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8717-8726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Siman R. Bozyczko-Coyne D. Meyer S.L. Bhat R.V. Neuroscience. 1999; 92: 1425-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Blots were probed with anti-caspase-12 (hybridoma supernatant, diluted 1/12), anti-calpain-cleaved α-spectrin (1/3,000), anti-caspase-3 (1/1,000), anti-caspase 6-cleaved lamin A (1/5,000), anti-Grp94 (1/10,000), anti-Grp78/BiP (1/10,000), anti-PERK (1/1,000), or anti-cytochrome c(1/300). For quantitative analyses, blots were reprobed with anti-actin (1/10,000) so that the density of each protein band could be normalized to that of actin. Band densities were measured from digitized images using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics) under conditions in which band densities varied in linear proportion to the amount of sample loaded. For immunocytochemistry, cultures were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min, permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100, and stained by the biotin-avidin-peroxidase technique (33Roberts-Lewis J.M. Savage M.J. Marcy V. Pinsker L. Siman R. J. Neurosci. 1994; 16: 3934-3944Crossref Google Scholar, 35Siman R. Bozyczko-Coyne D. Meyer S.L. Bhat R.V. Neuroscience. 1999; 92: 1425-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For detecting neuronal apoptosis, fixed cultures were permeabilized and were then stained with Hoechst 33342 at 37 °C for 15 min, rinsed, and examined under ultraviolet illumination. Images were captured using a Nikon Diaphot microscope and Spot CCD (charge-coupled device) camera. Quantitative analysis of neuronal death was conducted using neurons cultured for 14 days and trypan blue staining as described previously (32Siman R. Reaume A.G. Savage M.J. Trusko S. Lin Y.-G. Scott R.W. Flood D.G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8717-8726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For each experimental treatment, five cultures of each genotype were evaluated, and for each culture three randomly chosen fields and >300 cells were evaluated. The apoptotic index was calculated as the number of trypan blue-positive cells/total number of cells. Cultured neurons from two 100-mm dishes were washed twice in ice-cold homogenization buffer consisting of 0.25 m sucrose, 50 mm Pipes-KOH (pH 7.2), 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 3 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5 mm EGTA plus protease inhibitors (100 μm leupeptin, 2 μmpepstatin A, 30 μm calpain inhibitor II). Cells were collected by gentle scraping in homogenization buffer and centrifugation and were then broken in a small glass homogenizer with 60 strokes of a loose-fitting glass pestle using homogenization buffer lacking the protease inhibitors. The homogenate was centrifuged for 8 min at 1000 × g to pellet nuclei and unbroken cells, and then the supernatant was centrifuged 15 min at 10,000 ×g. The pellet was taken as the crude mitochondrial/synaptosomal fraction. The supernatant was centrifuged for 60 min at 100,000 × g, and the resulting pellet was taken as the ER-enriched crude microsomal fraction, whereas the supernatant was taken as the cytosolic fraction. To analyze the composition of the fractions, 10 μg of protein from each fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting to detect procaspase-12, cytochrome c, or Grp94. To evaluate the sensitivity of procaspase-12 to calpain cleavage, a post-mitochondrial supernatant was prepared from mouse brain. Briefly, brains from 9-day-old mice were homogenized in 5 volumes of homogenization buffer and centrifuged as described above for cultured cells. The supernatant from the 10,000 × gcentrifugation was taken as the post-mitochondrial fraction. It was incubated 60 min at 37 °C in either 5 mmCaCl2 to activate the endogenous calpain (36Siman R. Baudry M. Lynch G. J. Neurochem. 1983; 41: 950-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) or 5 mm EGTA and was then prepared for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Some reactions contained calpeptin at 30 μm or Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde at 5 μm. Levels of Grp78/BiP mRNA were determined by semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis (25Sato N. Urano F. Leem J.Y. Kim S.-H. Li M. Donoviel D. Bernstein A. Lee A.S. Ron D. Veselits M.L. Sisodia S.S. Thinakaran G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) of mRNA isolated from cultured mouse cortical neurons. Cultures were treated for 6 h with vehicle (0.1% Me2SO), tunicamycin (0.5 μg/ml or 3 μg/ml), or thapsigargin (0.2 μm or 1 μm). Each 100-mm dish was washed twice in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, and cells were scraped gently into the same buffer and collected by centrifugation. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Aliquots of reverse-transcribed RNA were subjected to PCR using primer pairs specific for Grp78/BiP (5′-CTGGGTACATTTGATCTGACTGG-3′ and 5′-GCATCCTGGTGGCTTTCCAGCCATTC-3′ and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (5′-GATGACATCAAGAAGGTGGTGAAG-3′ and 5′-GTGAGGGAGATGCTCAGTGTTGG-3′). To establish a linear amplification range, equivalent aliquots were incubated in a PCR, and individual reactions were removed at 16, 18, 20, and 22 cycles. Based on the results, subsequent PCRs were incubated for 22 cycles. The PCR products were fractionated on agarose gels, stained, and quantified by fluorescent imaging (Typhoon 8600 Variable Mode Imager, Molecular Dynamics). The blockade of N-linked glycosylation by tunicamycin leads to misfolding of newly synthesized proteins in the ER (2Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3602) Google Scholar) and elicits the ER stress responses of chaperone induction (the UPR), translational suppression, and caspase-mediated apoptosis in a variety of cultured cells, including neurons (8Perez-Sala D. Mollinedo F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 163: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 9Chang J.Y. Korolev V.V. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 137: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We examined the effects of tunicamycin on primary cortical neurons cultured from mice that were either wild type for PS-1 or homozygous for the AD-linked point mutation PS-1P264L, which was introduced into the mouse genome by gene targeting (PS-1 knock-in (32Siman R. Reaume A.G. Savage M.J. Trusko S. Lin Y.-G. Scott R.W. Flood D.G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8717-8726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). The PS-1 P264L knock-in mutation is phenotypically active in the mouse, increasing the secretion of the amyloid Aβ42 protein from primary cortical neurons, elevating Aβ42 levels in the brain, and accelerating amyloid neuropathology in afflicted brain regions (32Siman R. Reaume A.G. Savage M.J. Trusko S. Lin Y.-G. Scott R.W. Flood D.G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8717-8726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of primary cortical neurons with tunicamycin for 24 h (9Chang J.Y. Korolev V.V. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 137: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) led to apoptosis characterized by perikaryal shrinkage, retraction of processes, chromatin condensation, and fragmentation, features that did not differ qualitatively between neurons of the two PS-1 genotypes (Fig.1 A). To examine the involvement of particular cysteine proteases in tunicamycin-induced neuronal apoptosis, a panel of antibodies was employed for immunoblot and immunohistochemical detection of protease activation and substrate degradation. The p17 large subunit of caspase-3 is generated by proteolytic processing of the proprotease zymogen (37Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday R.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3796) Google Scholar, 38Tewari M. Quan L.T.

An antibody that reacts specifically with the activated caspase-3 p17 subunit readily immunostained cortical neurons following tunicamycin treatment but exhibited little neuronal labeling under control conditions (Fig. 1 B). Active caspase-3 immunoreactivity extended throughout neuronal perikarya into multiple dendritic processes and their distal branches. Activation of caspase-6 was monitored using a cleavage site-specific antibody (Ab255) reactive with the NH2-terminal fragment of lamin A, a nuclear matrix protein and preferential caspase-6 substrate that is cleaved during apoptosis (39Takahashi A. Alnemri E.S. Lazebnik Y.A. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Moir R.D. Goldman R.D. Poirier G.G. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 16443-16446Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Whereas little immunoreactivity for caspase-6-cleaved lamin A was observed in neurons under basal conditions, ER stress produced intense immunolabeling concentrated in neuronal nuclei. These data demonstrate that ER stress in cortical neurons causes the activation of at least two effector caspases and spreads from the ER to the cytosol and nucleus. ER stress induces apoptosis through a signaling pathway thought to be distinct from the “mitochondrial” and “death receptor” cascades triggered by caspase-9 and -8, respectively, and instead may be initiated by calpain (27Nakagawa T. Yuan J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar), a family of calcium-dependent cysteine proteases (41Sorimachi H. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Subsequently, calpain reportedly cleaves and activates an ER-resident protease caspase-12 (24Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2955) Google Scholar), triggering apoptosis through a poorly defined mechanism. We investigated this signaling pathway by subcellular fractionation and immunoblotting, and found that the ∼60-kDa procaspase-12 was concentrated in the ER-enriched microsomal fraction (Fig. 2 A). The fidelity of the fractions was confirmed by enrichment of cytochromec in the mitochondrial fraction (Fig. 2 A) and of calpain I in the cytosol fraction. 2R. Siman and R. W. Neumar, unpublished observations. To determine whether calpain can process procaspase-12, we incubated post-mitochondrial supernatants from mouse brain with calcium to activate the endogenous calpains I and II (36Siman R. Baudry M. Lynch G. J. Neurochem. 1983; 41: 950-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Calpain activation diminished the level of procaspase-12 and pro"
https://openalex.org/W2047610280,"Lipid analysis of gestational day E14.5 mouse brain revealed elevation of ceramide to a tissue concentration that induced apoptosis when added to the medium of neuroprogenitor cells grown in cell culture. Elevation of ceramide was coincident with the first appearance of b-series complex gangliosides (BCGs). Expression of BCGs by stable transfection of murine neuroblastoma (F-11) cells with sialyltransferase-II (ST2) resulted in a 70% reduction of ceramide-induced apoptosis. This was most likely due to an 80% reduced expression of prostate apoptosis response-4 (PAR-4). PAR-4 expression and apoptosis were restored by preincubation of ST2-transfected cells with N-butyl deoxinojirimycin (NB-DNJ) or PD98059, two inhibitors of ganglioside biosynthesis or p42/44 mitogen-activated protein (MAPK) kinase, respectively. In sections of day E14.5 mouse brain, the intermediate zone showed intensive staining for complex gangliosides, but only low staining for apoptosis (TUNEL) and PAR-4. Apoptosis and PAR-4 expression, however, were elevated in the ventricular zone which only weakly stained for complex gangliosides. Whole cell patch clamping revealed a 2-fold increased calcium influx in ST2-transfected cells, the blocking of which with nifedipine restored apoptosis to the level of untransfected cells. In serum-free culture, supplementation of the medium with IGF-1 was required to maintain MAPK phosphorylation and the anti-apoptotic effect of BCG expression. BCG-enhanced calcium influx and the presence of insulin-like growth factor-1 may thus activate a cell survival mechanism that selectively protects developing neurons against ceramide-induced apoptosis by up-regulation of MAPK and reduction of PAR-4 expression.

Glycosphingolipid structures are abbreviated according to the IUPAC-IUB recommendations (IUPAC Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature, 1977) except gangliosides, which are abbreviated according to Svennerholm (46Svennerholm L. J. Lipid Res. 1964; 5: 145-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) Ceramide and gangliosides are sphingolipids that are abundant in the plasma membrane of neuronal cells and are suggested to have a regulatory function in cellular differentiation and apoptosis (1Goswami R.

Ceramide is known to induce differentiation or apoptosis in a variety of different cell types whereas the physiological significance of gangliosides for these processes is still unclear (3Schwarz A. Futerman A.H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2929-2938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Toman R.E. Spiegel S. Faden A.I. J. Neurotrauma. 2001; 17: 891-898Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Recent studies with transgenic mice lacking neutral glucosphingolipids (glucosyltransferase knockout) or complex gangliosides (N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase I knockout) indicate a high incidence of apoptosis in the nervous system during embryonal development or adulthood (5Sheikh K.A. Sun J. Liu Y. Kawai H. Crawford T.O. Proia R.L. Griffin J.W. Schnaar R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7532-7537Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 6Wu G. Xie X. Lu Z.-H.

Most recently, theN-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase I/sialyltransferase II (GalNAcT1/ST2) double knockout mouse has been reported to show spontaneous death and audiogenic seizures (8Kawai H. Allende M.L. Wada R. Kono M. Sango K. Deng C. Miyakawa T. Crawley J.N. Werth N. Bierfreund U. Sandhoff K. Proia R.L. J. Biol.

These results prompted us to investigate the role of gangliosides as potential anti-apoptotic effectors during early mouse brain development. Cell survival is crucial in this developmental period because about half of the proliferative neurons and glial cells die by apoptosis between gestational days E12 and E18 (9Blaschke A.J. Staley K. Chun J. Development. 1996; 122: 1165-1174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This period is coincident with a switch from simple to complex gangliosides in brain tissue at days E14-E16 that has also been found during neuronal differentiation of teratocarcinoma-derived embryonic stem cells (2Yu R.K. Prog. Brain Res. 1994; 101: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar,10Liour S.-S. Kapitonov D. Yu R.K. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 62: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The simple gangliosides GM3 and GD3 are converted to the b-series complex gangliosides (BCGs) of the type GD1b, GT1b, and GQ1b by up-regulation of ST2 and GalNAcT. We have established an in vitro model for conversion of simple gangliosides to BCGs in neuronal cell culture by stable expression of ST2 in F-11A cells (11Bieberich E. Tencomnao T. Kapitonov D. Yu R.K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2359-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). F-11A cells are derived from murine neuroblastoma x rat dorsal root ganglion F-11 cells that were selected for a predominant expression of GM3 (>80% of total gangliosides). The ST2 cDNA was endowed with a C-terminal FLAG epitope and fused with green fluorescent protein (ST2-FLAG-GFP) to monitor the enzyme expression and subcellular localization by immunostaining and fluorescence microscopy. Recently, we have reported that F-11 cells undergo apoptosis upon incubation with novel ceramide analogs that have been synthesized by N-acylation of serinol (12Bieberich E. Kawaguchi T. Yu R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 177-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These ceramide analogs are highly soluble in water (up to 0.5 mm) and are not degraded by enzymes active in ceramide metabolism. We have used N-oleoyl serinol (S18) in addition to N-acetylsphingosine (C2-ceramide) to induce apoptosis in untransfected, GFP-transfected, or ST2-FLAG-GFP transfected F-11A cells. These cells were analyzed for the degree of apoptosis and signaling pathways known to participate in ceramide-induced cell death, in particular the PKCζ/PAR-4 and PI3K/MEK1 pathways (13Camandola S. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 61: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 14Diaz-Meco M.T. Municio M.M. Frutos S. Sanchez P. Lozano J. Sanz L. Moscat J.

The significance of BCG expression for a specific cell signaling event was verified by preincubation withN-butyl deoxinojirimycin (NB-DNJ), an inhibitor of glycolipid biosynthesis that does not induce apoptosis by itself (17Bieberich E. Freischütz B. Suzuki M. Yu R.K. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1040-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The results from the analysis of apoptosis and protein expression in neuroblastoma cells were compared with those obtained from preimplantation blastocyst-derived murine embryonic stem (ES-J1) cells which were used as in vitro model for neuronal differentiation. The biological significance of ceramide and BCGs for neuronal apoptosis was investigated by analysis of the lipid and regulatory protein expression in mouse brain at different stages of embryonal development. Murine F-11 and ES-J1 cells were kindly provided by Drs. Glyn Dawson (University of Chicago, Chicago, IL) and Levent Keskintepe (Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, GA), respectively. The novel ceramide analog S18 was kindly provided by Drs. Takahisa Kawaguchi, Bin Hu, and Raphael Ottenbrite (Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA). N-butyl deoxinojirimycin (NB-DNJ) was a generous gift from Dr. Thomas N. Seyfried (Boston College, Chestnut Hill, MA). The epidermal growth factor protein vector was purchased fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against PAR-4, trkA/B/C, caspase 3, bcl-2, IGF-I-receptor β-subunit, GAP-43, synaptophysin, and mouse monoclonal anti-phospho-Ser490-trkA were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal IgG against PKCζ, mouse monoclonal anti-MAP2a/b, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, LongR3-IGF-1 peptide analog, tetrodotoxin, glucamine, wortmannin, and nifedipine were from Sigma. Rabbit polyclonal IgG against GFP, anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa Fluor 594, Alexa 594-labeled cholera toxin B, goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa 488-conjugate, and goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa 546-conjugate were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Mouse monoclonal anti-phospho-Thr202/Tyr204-MAPK, anti-phospho-Ser112-BAD, rabbit polyclonal anti-BAD, and anti-MAPK was purchased from Cell Signaling/New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Anti-mouse IgG- horseradish peroxidase conjugate was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). The Fluorescein-FragEL TUNEL assay and the Suicide Tracker DNA-laddering assay were from Oncogene (Boston, MA). All cell culture media and supplements including LipofectAMINE, fetal bovine serum, N2 supplement, ITS supplement, murine 2.5 S nerve growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, insulin, and human recombinant insulin-like growth factor-1 were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). Glycolipid standards, including gangliosides, neutral glycolipids, and ceramide were from Matreya (Pleasant Gap, PA). All other chemicals were of analytical grade or higher and solvents were freshly redistilled before use. A cDNA encoding ST2 was amplified from a 15.5-day-old mouse embryo cDNA library as previously described (11Bieberich E. Tencomnao T. Kapitonov D. Yu R.K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2359-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The ST2 cDNA was endowed with a NheI restriction site on its N terminus and with a FLAG-epitope sequence/SalI restriction site on its C terminus using a primer combination of sense 5′-taggtaccgatatcacaccgaggctgcgatgag-3′ and antisense 5′-tagtcgacttgtcatcgtcgtccttgtaatc-3′ for polymerase chain reaction amplification. The polymerase chain reaction product was ligated in-frame into the NheI/SalI restriction sites of the GFP vector. The sequence of the ST2-FLAG-GFP construct was verified by DNA sequencing. Murine neuroblastoma x rat dorsal root ganglion (F-11) cells were separated into single cells and the clones were analyzed for their ganglioside expression. A clone termed F-11A expressed mainly GM3 and was used for stable transfection of the ST2-FLAG-GFP vector following the LipofectAMINE procedure as described by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). Clones transfected with the vector were isolated using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Transfected cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 500 μg/ml geneticin to prevent loss of the vector. The analysis of enzyme activity followed a protocol that has been previously described (11Bieberich E. Tencomnao T. Kapitonov D. Yu R.K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2359-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The novel ceramide analog N-oleoyl serinol (S18) was synthesized from serinol (2-amino-1,3-propanediol) and oleoyl chloride following a previously described procedure (12Bieberich E. Kawaguchi T. Yu R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 177-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Lipid preparation and analysis followed a standard protocol (17Bieberich E. Freischütz B. Suzuki M. Yu R.K. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1040-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Analysis of the acidic lipids was performed by HPTLC using the solvent system CHCl3, CH3OH, 0.2% CaCl2 (50:45:10; v/v) whereas the analysis of ceramide was performed using the solvent system CH3OH/HOAc (9:1, v/v). Lipids were stained with 3% cupric acetate in 8% phosphoric acid and compared with standard lipids as described elsewhere (17Bieberich E. Freischütz B. Suzuki M. Yu R.K. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1040-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 18Macala L.J. Yu R.K. Ando S. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 25: 1243-1250Google Scholar). Gangliosides were specifically stained for by use of the resorcinol-HCl reagent. Preimplantation blastocyst embryonic stem cells (ES-J1) were grown on γ-irradiated feeder fibroblasts and neuronal differentiation was induced by serum deprivation of embryoid bodies (EBs) as previously described (19Hancock C.R. Wetherington J.P. Lambert N.A. Condie B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 418-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Protein was prepared from undifferentiated fibroblast-free ES-J1 cells, EBs, and differentiated neuroprogenitor cells at day 4 post-attachment of EBs on poly-l-ornithin/laminin-coated tissue culture dishes. Forebrains were prepared from mouse embryos extracted at days E12.5 to E18.5 by axial incision above the eye anlage followed by careful removal of the outer skin layers from the embryo head. The forebrains (5 to 20, depending on age) were taken up in 1 ml of deionized water and subjected to protein analysis and lipid extraction. For immunofluroescence microscopy, whole embryos were fixed by immersion in 10% formalin followed by gelatin embedding and saggital Vibratome sectioning at 30 μm thickness. The embryo slices were first permeabilized for 5 min with 0.5% Triton X-100 and subjected to the TUNEL assay as described by the manufacturer (Oncogene). For identification of single cells, the slices were stained for 30 min with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 before immunostaining. The identification of complex gangliosides was performed by first incubating the embryo slices with 100 milliunits/ml Vibrio cholerae sialidase for 2 h at 37 °C which resulted in the conversion of a- and b-series complex gangliosides into GM1. The desialylation reaction was followed by staining of GM1 with 1 μg/ml Alexa 596-labeled cholera toxin subunit B (cholera toxin B) for another 2 h at 37 °C. The degree of cell death was determined by fluorescent staining of living and dead cells by the use of the Live/Dead Viability/Cytoxicity assay with cells cultivated on 96-well tissue culture dishes following the protocol given by the manufacturer (Molecular Probes). A quantitative analysis of apoptosis was performed using a TUNEL-based fluorescein-FragEL assay (Oncogene) by counting of TUNEL-positive cells in 5 areas with an average cell number of 200 cells that were grown on coverslips. Apoptosis was verified by visualization of fragmented DNA that was separated by agarose gel electrophoresis following the procedure of the Suicide Tracker DNA-laddering assay (Oncogene). The recording of whole-cell calcium currents was performed as described elsewhere (20Hamill O.P. Marty E. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15138) Google Scholar). Calcium influx was monitored using a bath solution composed of 20 mm BaCl2, 20 mm CsCl2, 110 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 1.8 mmMgCl2, 15 mm glucose, and 0.1 μmtetrodotoxin in 10 mm HEPES-buffer adjusted to pH 7.4 with CsOH. The pipette solution contained 120 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, 20 mmtetraethylammonium chloride, 11 mm EGTA, 1 mmCaCl2, 4 mm MgATP, 0.1 mmNa2GTP, and 14 mm phosphocreatine in 10 mm HEPES buffer adjusted to pH 7.2 with methanesulfonic acid. A holding potential of −80 mV was employed with depolarization currents evoked at −90 to 50 mV and digitized at 180 μs per point using low-pass filtering at 5 kHz (−3 dB). Analysis of the data was performed using a Power Macintosh 8600/200 computer supplied with PCI-16 Host Interface card. It was connected to an ITC-16 Data Acquisition Interface (Instrutech Corp, Port Washington, NY) utilizing Pulse Control 5.0 XOPs (obtained from Richard Bookman, Jack D. Herrington, and Kenneth R. Newton, University of Miami, FL) with Igor software (WavesMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). The amount of protein was analyzed using a modification of the Folin phenol reagent (Lowry) assay as described (21Wang C.-S. Smith R.L. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 63: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Protein precipitation was performed according to the Wessel and Flügge method (22Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3163) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was carried out using the Laemmli method followed by immunoblotting as described (23Gershoni J.M. Palade G.E. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 13: 1-15Crossref Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were used at a concentration of 1 μg/ml for immunoblotting and 5 μg/ml for immunofluorescence staining. Forebrains were removed from mouse embryos and analyzed for the expression of gangliosides and ceramide. Fig.1 A shows that the predominant gangliosides at day E12.5 were GM3 and GD3 (lane 2). BCGs were detectable at day E14.5 (lane 3), which was followed by the decline of GM3 and GD3 at day E16.5 (lane 4). The expression of GM1 and GD1a was initiated between days E16.5 (lane 4) and E18.5 (lane 5) and then intensified during post-natal development (P7, lane 6; adult, lane 7). The expression of ceramide was already found at day E12.5 (Fig. 1 B, lane 1) and increased by about 40% at day E14.5 as determined by densitometry (lane 2). This was followed by a decline by more than 50% from day E14.5 to E18.5 (Fig.1 B, lanes 2–4). The ceramide composition resolved into three bands, the middle band of which was intensified during post-natal development (P7, lane 5; P21, lane 6; adult, lane 7). The structural composition of the different ceramide species has not been characterized yet, but the separation of these bands may be a result of the differences in the fatty acid chain length (17Bieberich E. Freischütz B. Suzuki M. Yu R.K. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1040-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A quantitative HPTLC with stearoyl-sphingosine as standard (Fig. 1 B, lanes 8–11) revealed that the ceramide level at peak time day E14.5 was about 0.6 ± 0.1 μg of ceramide/mg of cell protein which is equivalent to a tissue concentration of ∼25 ± 5 μm (based on brain wet weight). F-11A-cells were transfected with a cDNA construct composed of a 1341-base pair sequence encoding ST2 and a C-terminal linked FLAG-epitope followed by the sequence of epidermal growth factor protein. Several independent clones were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and were found to have a 4-fold higher specific ST2 activity than that of untransfected or GFP transfected control cells. As shown in Fig.2 A, expression of ST2-FLAG-GFP resulted in an altered cell morphology revealing bipolar process formation and completely obliterated clustering. Fig. 2 Bshows that ST2-FLAG-GFP was localized in the Golgi apparatus which was identical to the subcellular distribution found with wild-type ST2 (11Bieberich E. Tencomnao T. Kapitonov D. Yu R.K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2359-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). SDS-gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting of a protein preparation from transfected cells showed the expression of a 75-kDa protein corresponding to the molecular mass of ST2-FLAG-GFP (Fig.2 B). Sphingolipids were isolated from transfected cells and analyzed by high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC). As shown in Fig. 2 C, the neutral sphingolipid fraction of ST2-FLAG-GFP-transfected cells (lanes 7 and10) revealed no difference in the expression of glycosphingolipids, sphingomyelin, or ceramide as compared with F-11A cells that were only transfected with GFP (lanes 6 and9). Upon stable expression of ST2-FLAG-GFP the major gangliosides changed from GM3 found in GFP-transfected cells (lane 3) to GT1b and GQ1b (lane 4) which amounted to 50% of the total gangliosides. GD3, GD2, and GD1b were expressed in smaller amounts (40% of total gangliosides) whereas GM3 was only detectable in trace amounts. This result indicated that the expression of ST2-FLAG-GFP shifted the ganglioside composition from a- to b-series and enhanced the amount of complex gangliosides (b-series complex gangliosides or BCGs). As shown in Figs. 1 A (lane 4) and 2C (lane 4), the composition of gangliosides in ST2-FLAG-GFP-transfected F-11A cells was almost identical to that in mouse brain at day E16.5 of embryonal development. The effect of ganglioside expression on ceramide-induced apoptosis was investigated by overnight incubation of untransfected, GFP, or ST2-FLAG-GFP-transfected cells with 30 μm N-acetylsphingosine (C2-ceramide) or 80 μm of the novel ceramide analog S18. GFP-transfected cells did not reveal any difference in the degree of apoptosis as compared with untransfected cells. As shown in Table I, however, ST2-FLAG-GFP expressing cells revealed up to a 70% reduction in apoptosis depending on the concentration and type of the pro-apoptotic agent used for the incubation reaction. This result was verified by a DNA fragmentation assay that showed no appearance of 200-base pair fragments (DNA laddering) upon incubation of ST2-FLAG-GFP-transfected cells with S18 (Fig. 3 A, lane 4) whereas GFP-transfected cells revealed intensive DNA laddering (Fig. 3 A, lane 2). It should be noted, however, that the degree of apoptosis was critically depending on cell density as previously reported (11Bieberich E. Tencomnao T. Kapitonov D. Yu R.K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2359-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). All of the experiments were performed at exactly 50% confluence, a cell density that previously revealed the highest degree of apoptosis induced with ceramide analogs in untransfected F-11A cells.Table IC2-ceramide or S18-induced cell death in GFP or ST2-FLAG-GFP transfected F-11A cellsGFP-F-11AST2-FLAG-GFP-F-11A+ Serum− Serum+ Serum− Serum20 h35 h48 h20 h35 h48 h20 h35 h48 h20 h35 h48 hControl< 5< 5< 5< 51255< 5< 5< 5< 51676C2-ceramide (30 μm)9598294360335280S18 (80 μm)839898273848324891GD1b + S18 (80 μm)417385GT1b + S18 (80 μm)7595GQ1b + S18 (80 μm)657895NBdNJ (250 μm)< 5< 5< 5< 5< 5< 5NBdNJ + C2-cer9398NBdNJ + S18 (80 μm)9895PD98059 (50 μm)< 588< 578PD98059 + C2-cer9898PD98059 + S189398NGF (100 ng/ml)< 5< 57< 5< 532NGF + S18 (80 μm)98223582NGF + C2-cer (30 μm)98357998N2 supplement< 5< 58< 5< 512N2 + S18 (80 μm)98112348ITS supplement< 5< 510< 5< 515Insulin (5 μg/ml)< 51120< 51325Insulin + S18 (80 μm)98152961Insulin (100 ng/ml)< 51845< 51550IGF-1 (100 ng/ml)< 5< 58< 5818IGF-1 + S18 (80 μm)98102552R31GF-1 (100 ng/ml)< 5< 810< 5< 515Cells were cultivated in 96-well dishes and incubated with 30 μm N-acetylsphingosine (C2-cer) or 80 μm N-oleoylserinol (S18) in serum-supplemented or serum-free medium for times indicated.

The effect of different inhibitors was analyzed by preincubation for 5 h with 50 μm PD98059 (MEK1-inhibitor) or for 72 h with 250 μm NB-DNJ (glycolipid biosynthesis inhibitor). The number of living cells was quantified by the determination of calcein-esterase activity, and the number of dead cells was determined by diethidium bromide staining (Dead/Alive assay, Molecular Probes). All measurements were done with a sample size ofn = 6. The mean standard variation was 15% of the average value as given in the table. Open table in a new tab Cells were cultivated in 96-well dishes and incubated with 30 μm N-acetylsphingosine (C2-cer) or 80 μm N-oleoylserinol (S18) in serum-supplemented or serum-free medium for times indicated.

All measurements were done with a sample size ofn = 6. The mean standard variation was 15% of the average value as given in the table. The involvement of gangliosides in the reduction of apoptosis was analyzed by preincubation of GFP or ST2-FLAG-GFP-transfected cells with 250 μm of the glycolipid biosynthesis inhibitor NB-DNJ prior to the addition of S18 or C2-ceramide. As shown in Fig.2 C (lane 5), ST2-FLAG-GFP-transfected cells were completely deprived of gangliosides. NB-DNJ did not affect the degree of ceramide-induced apoptosis in GFP-transfected control cells but restored that of ST2-FLAG-GFP-transfected cells to control level (TableI). This was verified by the appearance of DNA laddering that was induced by S18 after preincubation with NB-DNJ (Fig. 3 A, lane 3). The expression of the pro-apoptotic protein PAR-4 was analyzed by means of indirect immunofluorescence microscopy in combination with a TUNEL assay in untransfected F-11A cells upon incubation with S18. As shown in Fig. 3 A (right panel), more than 80% of the TUNEL-positive cells were strongly stained for PAR-4 indicating that its expression is necessary for the induction of apoptosis. The number of strongly stained cells, however, exceeded that of TUNEL-positive cells. ST2-FLAG-GFP-transfected cells expressed about 80% less PAR-4 and showed no TUNEL staining (not shown). The overall expression of PAR-4 was further analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting of protein extracts from detergent-solubilized cells. Fig. 3 B shows that the amount of immunostained PAR-4 in ST2-FLAG-GFP-transfected cells (lane 2) was only 20% of that in GFP-transfected control cells (lane 1) consistent with the results from immunofluorescence microscopy. Incubation of ST2-FLAG-GFP-transfected cells with NB-DNJ or the MEK1-inhibitor PD98059 increased PAR-4 expression to the level of control cells (lanes 3). The expression of the anti-apoptotic protein bcl-2 was analyzed by immunoblotting as described before and was found to be about 3–4-fold elevated in ST2-FLAG-GFP-transfected cells (lane 2) as compared with control cells (lane 1). ST2-FLAG-GFP-transfected cells preincubated with NB-DNJ (lane 3) or PD98059 (lane 4), however, showed restoration of the bcl-2 expression level to that of control cells (lane 1). The effects of growth factors on cell proliferation and apoptosis were analyzed by incubation of GFP or ST2-FLAG-GFP-transfected F-11A cells with N2, ITS (insulin-transferrin-selenite), NGF, bFGF/FGF-2, insulin, or IGF-1 supplemented serum-free medium. Removal of serum resulted in an increased cell death in GFP or ST2-FLAG-GFP-transfected cells, even without the addition of C2-ceramide or S18 to the medium (Table I). Cell death resulted from apoptosis as revealed by punctate Hoechst staining of the nuclei. Apoptosis, however, could be prevented by the addition of 0.5% FBS, N2, or ITS supplement to the cell culture medium. Among single growth factors, it was found that NGF (100 ng/ml), insulin (5 μg/ml), IGF-1 (100 ng/ml), or its peptide analog LongR3-IGF-1 (100 ng/ml) could reduce cell death by at least 70% (Table I"
https://openalex.org/W2073233547,"Intramembranous cleavage of the β-amyloid precursor protein by γ-secretase is the final processing event generating amyloid-β peptides, which are thought to be causative agents for Alzheimer's disease. Missense mutations in the presenilin genes co-segregate with early-onset Alzheimer's disease, and, recently, a close biochemical linkage between presenilins and the identity of γ-secretase has been established. Here we describe for the first time that certain potent γ-secretase inhibitors are able to interfere with the endoproteolytic processing of presenilin 1 (PS1). In addition, we identified a novel γ-secretase inhibitor, {1S-benzyl-4R-[1-(5-cyclohexyl-2-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[e][1,4]diazepin-3(R,S)-ylcarbamoyl)-S-ethylcarbamoyl]-2R-hydroxy-5-phenyl-pentyl}-carbamic acid tert-butyl ester (CBAP), which not only physically interacts with PS1, but upon chronic treatment produces a “pharmacological knock-down” of PS1 fragments. This indicates that the observed accumulation of full-length PS1 is caused by a direct inhibition of its endoproteolysis. The subsequent use of CBAP as a biological tool to increase full-length PS1 levels in the absence of exogenous PS1 expression has provided evidence that wild-type PS1 endoproteolysis is not required either for PS1/γ-secretase complex assembly or trafficking. Furthermore, in cell-based systems CBAP does not completely recapitulate PS1 loss-of-function phenotypes. Even though the β-amyloid precursor protein cleavage and the S3 cleavage of the Notch receptor are inhibited by CBAP, an impairment of Trk receptor maturation was not observed. Intramembranous cleavage of the β-amyloid precursor protein by γ-secretase is the final processing event generating amyloid-β peptides, which are thought to be causative agents for Alzheimer's disease. Missense mutations in the presenilin genes co-segregate with early-onset Alzheimer's disease, and, recently, a close biochemical linkage between presenilins and the identity of γ-secretase has been established. Here we describe for the first time that certain potent γ-secretase inhibitors are able to interfere with the endoproteolytic processing of presenilin 1 (PS1). In addition, we identified a novel γ-secretase inhibitor, {1S-benzyl-4R-[1-(5-cyclohexyl-2-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[e][1,4]diazepin-3(R,S)-ylcarbamoyl)-S-ethylcarbamoyl]-2R-hydroxy-5-phenyl-pentyl}-carbamic acid tert-butyl ester (CBAP), which not only physically interacts with PS1, but upon chronic treatment produces a “pharmacological knock-down” of PS1 fragments.

Presenilins are polytopic membrane proteins that undergo endoproteolytic processing within their putative loop region, yielding N-terminal and C-terminal polypeptides (PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF) thought to consist of six and two transmembrane domains, respectively (21Thinakaran G.

Mutagenesis of either of two aspartate residues in transmembrane domains 6 or 7 of PS1 inactivates γ-secretase and blocks endoproteolysis (22Kimberly W.T. Xia W. Rahmati T. Wolfe M.S. Selkoe D.J. J.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11223-11230Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Because these aspartates are critical for PS1 function, it has been proposed that PS1 is either a novel membrane-bound aspartyl protease or an essential di-aspartyl cofactor for the enzyme (23Wolfe M.S. De Los A.J. Miller D.D. Xia W. Selkoe D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11223-11230Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). This is further supported by the findings that PS1 is linked with γ-secretase activity in the detergent-solubilized state (24Li Y.M. Lai M.T. Xu M. Huang Q. DiMuzio-Mower J. Sardana M.K. Shi X.P.

Moreover, evidence has been generated that full-length PS1 (PS1-FL) might be a zymogen (26Li Y.M. Xu M. Lai M.T. Huang Q. Castro J.L. DiMuzio-Mower J. Harrison T. Lellis C. Nadin A. Neduvelil J.G. Register R.B. Sardana M.K. Shearman M.S. Smith A.L. Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J.

Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). One prediction of this model is that an inhibitor of γ-secretase that binds to PS1 should interfere with its endoproteolysis. We report that a novel γ-secretase inhibitor, CBAP, not only blocks PS1 endoproteolysis, but upon chronic treatment, induces a “pharmacological knock-down” of PS1 fragments. We have subsequently used CBAP to gain novel insights into the assembly and trafficking of the high molecular weight PS1/γ-secretase complexes, without artificial overexpression of the polypeptide. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the proteolytic activity associated with PS1/γ-secretase necessary for the cleavage of βAPP and the S3 cleavage of the Notch receptor can be dissociated from its function in membrane protein trafficking. This suggests that phenotypes resulting from the absence of presenilin expression are not completely recapitulated by γ-secretase inhibition.DISCUSSIONOur data demonstrate that certain potent and structurally diverse γ-secretase inhibitors either identified by ourselves such asl-685,458, or others (compounds 5 and 6; Ref. 28Seiffert D. Bradley J.D. Rominger C.M. Rominger D.H. Yang F. Meredith Jr., J.E. Wang Q. Roach A.H. Thompson L.A. Spitz S.M. Higaki J.N. Prakash S.R. Combs A.P. Copeland R.A. Arneric S.P. Hartig P.R.

This effect is immediate, indicating that as soon as one of these compounds enters cells it inhibits separate processing events simultaneously: presenilin/γ-secretase cleavage of βAPP and Notch and PS1-FL endoproteolysis.Detailed structure-activity relationship analyses of these two processes led to the discovery of a novel l-685,458 derivative, CBAP, which enabled us to determine the principle mechanism underlying our initial observations. The accumulation of PS1-FL could be explained by interfering nonspecifically with its degradation by the proteasome system. This system has been shown to degrade PS1-FL rapidly (50Steiner H. Capell A. Pesold B. Citron M. Kloetzel P.M. Selkoe D.J. Romig H. Mendla K. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32322-32331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), leading to half-lives of ∼1.5 h for the full-length polypeptide in PS1-transfected cells (51Ratovitski T. Slunt H.H. Thinakaran G. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Borchelt D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24536-24541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). However, the knock-down of PS1 fragments, observed exclusively upon chronic treatment of cells with CBAP, unambiguously demonstrates that the inhibitors directly block the endoproteolytic cleavage of the PS1-FL polypeptide into its fragments. Mechanistically, this could be explained in a number of ways: (i) direct inhibition of the putative enzyme responsible for the cleavage of PS1-FL (“presenilinase”), (ii) indirect inhibition of presenilinase cleavage as a consequence of binding to and changing the conformation of PS1-FL, and (iii) binding to PS1-FL and interfering with intramolecular autoproteolysis. Although our data do not provide conclusive evidence to determine which of these possibilities is correct, we have made several key observations. First,l-685,458 shows greater than 100-fold selectivity over other classes of proteases, including aspartyl proteases such as HIV-1 and cathepsin D (25Shearman M.S. Beher D. Clarke E.E. Lewis H.D. Harrison T. Hunt P. Nadin A. Smith A.L. Stevenson G. Castro J.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 38: 8698-8704Crossref Scopus (364) Google Scholar), and structural modifications that abolish γ-secretase inhibition concomitantly lead to a loss of an inhibition of PS1 processing (e.g. compounds 1 and 8). Accordingly, for endoproteolytic cleavage to be mediated by a molecularly distinct presenilinase, this enzyme would require a pharmacological profile very similar to γ-secretase itself, an explanation that as yet would appear unlikely.Two of the above possibilities require active site-directed transition state analogue inhibitors to bind to PS1-FL, considered to be a zymogen. We have no direct biochemical evidence to date that any of our inhibitors bind to PS1-FL, and previous work has shown that PS1-FL could not be cross-linked in vitro to specific photoprobes derived from l-685,458 (26Li Y.M. Xu M. Lai M.T. Huang Q. Castro J.L. DiMuzio-Mower J. Harrison T. Lellis C. Nadin A. Neduvelil J.G. Register R.B. Sardana M.K. Shearman M.S. Smith A.L. Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Nature. 2000; 405: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar) using membranes from cells overexpressing PS1. It still remains to be seen whether photoprobes may be able to cross-link to PS1-FL in cells. If untransfected cells are used, where PS1 trafficking and complex formation should resemble thein vivo situation, the minute amounts of holoprotein present in these cells will make this an extremely difficult task. Hence, it cannot be ruled out completely that, at high concentrations, certain inhibitors bind to PS1-FL in vivo. The compounds described herein have been identified and selected based on their ability to inhibit Aβ peptide production, and it is therefore not surprising that the potencies for Aβ inhibition do not necessarily mirror the inhibition of PS1 endoproteolysis. Furthermore, it is likely that processing of PS1-FL into its fragments results in a conformationally distinct entity. Complexes containing PS1-FL and those containing its fragments are therefore likely to constitute independent binding sites, and only compounds with a reasonable affinity for the former would be able to block the endoproteolysis of PS1. This could explain why some potent inhibitors of Aβ formation, such as compound 4 and others (data not shown), were not able to block PS1-FL cleavage and why higher concentrations of compounds are needed to inhibit PS1 endoproteolysis compared with γ-secretase inhibition.Using CBAP as a tool to shift the steady-state levels of PS1 fragments toward the full-length polypeptide in vivo, we could address the question of accumulation of PS1-FL in the ER of transfected cell lines and the structural requirements for PS1/γ-secretase complex formation. PS1 fragments are known to be components of a high molecular weight complex, which may include β-catenin (48Yu G. Chen F. Levesque G. Nishimura M. Zhang D.M. Levesque L. Rogaeva E. Xu D. Liang Y.

Aebersold R. Farrer L.S. Sorbi S. Bruni A. Fraser P. George-Hyslop P. Nature. 2000; 407: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar), and possibly others. Analyses of cells overexpressing PS1 suggested that under this paradigm exogenous wild-type PS1-FL is present in a different complex of lower molecular weight (48Yu G. Chen F. Levesque G. Nishimura M. Zhang D.M. Levesque L. Rogaeva E. Xu D. Liang Y. Duthie M. George-Hyslop P.H. Fraser P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16470-16475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). When solubilized PS1 from CBAP-treated cells was analyzed by rate-zonal glycerol velocity gradient centrifugation, we observed that both endogenous wild-type PS1-FL and its fragments are incorporated in a complex of identical molecular mass (∼350 kDa). We explored this further by determining the structural requirements for trafficking of PS1 from the ER to Golgi compartments. Subcellular fractionation of organelles from CBAP-treated cells provided evidence that both PS1 fragments and PS1-FL follow the same sorting pathway. This is again in contrast to the clear separation of PS1 fragments and PS1-FL described previously in transfected cell lines (47Zhang J. Kang D.E. Xia W. Okochi M. Mori H. Selkoe D.J. Koo E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12436-12442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Accordingly, our data argue that the accumulation of PS1-FL in the ER fraction of transfected cells is not caused by the lack of cleavage but must be a direct result of the artificial overexpression of the polypeptide. Taken together these data support the hypothesis of a “limiting stoichiometric cofactor” (46Thinakaran G. Harris C.L. Ratovitski T. Davenport F. Slunt H.H. Price D.L. Borchelt D.R. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28415-28422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), which would be necessary for the protein to exit the ER compartment. Because PS1-FL is incorporated into a high molecular weight complex in inhibitor-treated cells, it is likely that this factor binds to PS1-FL immediately after its synthesis, enabling the protein to be shuttled to the Golgi compartment. Cleavage into its fragments might be facilitated by the factor, or it may occur during the subsequent transport from the ER to the Golgi compartment, but our data clearly demonstrate that it is neither a structural requirement for trafficking nor for complex assembly.We have used the inhibitors described herein to determine which aberrant phenotypes in PS1 inactivated or deleted systems are related to a loss of protease function, against those caused by the physical absence of the PS1 polypeptide. All inhibitors analyzed were found to block the intramembranous cleavage of NotchΔE polypeptide at the S3 site, thereby inhibiting NICD formation. These results support previous findings (45De Strooper B. Annaert W. Cupers P. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Schrijvers V. Wolfe M.S. Ray W.J. Goate A. Kopan R. Nature. 1999; 398: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1786) Google Scholar) and strengthen the view that PS1 forms an essential component of the active site of γ-secretase. Moreover, neither a preferential inhibition of one of the βAPP γ-cleavages at position 40 or 42 nor the Notch S3 cleavage was observed. Inhibition of βAPP γ-cleavage without affecting Notch processing has been reported for a class of inhibitors containing an isocoumarin core, characteristic of chymotrypsin inhibitors (53Petit A. Bihel F. Alves da Costa C. Pourquie O. Checler F. Kraus J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The compounds described in that study, however, were 10,000–200,000-fold less potent inhibitors than the ones described here. It will be interesting to see in the future if selectivity of the isocoumarin-type inhibitors can be maintained over a larger concentration range and if derivatives can be identified that are several orders of magnitude more potent. In contrast to the Notch data, treatment of cortical neurons with γ-secretase inhibitors did not recapitulate the impairment in Trk receptor maturation, another aberrant phenotype that has been described in PS1 knock-out animals (39Naruse S.

This indicates that inhibition of protease activity does not affect this function of presenilin, which points toward a role for PS1 in membrane protein trafficking (39Naruse S. Thinakaran G. Luo J.J.

Resolving this issue is of utmost interest, as specific γ-secretase inhibitors that block PS1-associated protease functions are expected to be valuable therapeutic agents to combat AD pathology.

Although the imperfect vitellogenin B1, pS2, and oxytocin (OT) EREs each differ from the consensus vitellogenin A2 ERE sequence by a single base pair, ERβ activates transcription of reporter plasmids containing A2, pS2, B1, and OT EREs to different extents. To explain how these differences in transactivation might occur, we have examined the interaction of ERβ with these EREs and monitored recruitment of the coactivators amplified in breast cancer (AIB1) and transcription intermediary factor 2 (TIF2). Protease sensitivity, antibody interaction, and DNA pull-down assays demonstrated that ERβ undergoes ERE-dependent changes in conformation resulting in differential recruitment of AIB1 and TIF2 to the DNA-bound receptor. Overexpression of TIF2 or AIB1 in transient transfection assays differentially enhanced ERβ-mediated transcription of reporter plasmids containing the A2, pS2, B1, and OT EREs. Our studies demonstrate that individual ERE sequences induce changes in conformation of the DNA-bound receptor and influence coactivator recruitment.

In response to cellular signals, transcription factors bind to specific DNA sequences residing in target genes and interact with numerous regulatory proteins to form an active transcription complex and initiate changes in gene expression. This multistep process provides a mechanism by which cells expressing different populations of proteins can differentially regulate expression of target genes. The nuclear receptor superfamily is composed of a large number of transcription factors that bind to hormone response elements and modulate transcription. Estrogen receptors (ERs)1 α and β are members of this nuclear receptor superfamily (1Walter P. Green S. Greene G. Krust A. Bornert J.-M. Jeltsch J.-M. Staub A. Jensen E. Scrace G. Waterfield M.

Crystal structures of the ERα LBD with the nuclear receptor interaction domain from GRIP1 (18Shiau A.K. Barstad D. Loria P.M. Cheng L. Kushner P.J. Agard D.A. Greene G.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 927-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar) indicate that when the LBD is bound to an antagonist, the position of helix 12 interferes with coactivator binding. Thus, ligand-induced alterations in receptor conformation may alter coactivator recruitment and ultimately influence activation of transcription by ER. In addition to ligand-induced changes in conformation, there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that DNA sequences can modulate protein conformation. This allosteric modulation of protein conformation can dramatically alter gene expression, as has been documented with the POU domain-containing transcription factor Pit-1. Pit-1 serves as a potent activator of transcription when bound to its recognition site in the prolactin gene (19Scully K.M. Jacobson E.M. Jepsen K. Lunyak V. Viadiu H. Carriere C. Rose D.W. Hooshmand F. Aggarwal A.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 2000; 290: 1127-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), but represses transcription when bound to its recognition sequence in the growth hormone gene. DNA-induced conformational changes can also have more subtle effects resulting in alteration of the level of transcription. Allosteric modulation of nuclear receptor conformation has been implicated in influencing transcription of a number of hormone-responsive genes (19Scully K.M. Jacobson E.M. Jepsen K. Lunyak V.

Both ERα and ERβ bind to EREs and activate transcription, but ERβ is typically a less potent activator of reporter plasmids containing the vitellogenin A2 ERE compared with ERα (25McInerney E.M. Weis K.E. Sun J. Mosselman S. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4513-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 26Hanstein B. Liu H. Yancisin M.C. Brown M. Mol.

The basis for this differential activation of transcription by ERα and ERβ is unclear. The decreased affinity of ERβ for the ERE compared with ERα could impair its ability to activate transcription (28Loven M.A. Wood J.A. Nardulli A.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 181: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Additionally, studies with ERα/ERβ chimeric proteins indicate that the amino-terminal activation function 1 (AF-1) of these receptors vary in amino acid sequence and may influence the ability of these receptors to mediate transcription activation (25McInerney E.M. Weis K.E. Sun J. Mosselman S. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4513-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The goal of this study was to determine whether ERβ conformation is different when bound to different EREs and, if so, to characterize the effect of conformational changes on receptor-coactivator interactions and transactivation. We find that DNA-dependent changes in receptor conformation directly translate into alterations in epitope availability and that these DNA-induced changes in receptor conformation alter interaction of ERβ with coregulatory proteins. Thus, ERE-induced changes in ERβ conformation may ultimately influence the ability of ERβ to induce transcription activation.

The resulting probe (10,000 cpm) was combined with 65 fmol of baculovirus-expressed, FLAG-tagged purified ERβ (28Loven M.A. Wood J.A. Nardulli A.M. Mol. Cell.

The ERβ-DNA binding reaction was incubated for 8 min at 25 °C. Staphylococcus aureus protease V8 (Worthington) or proteinase K (Promega) was added as indicated, and the binding reactions were incubated for 10 min at 25 °C. Reactions were loaded onto a nondenaturing acrylamide gel and electrophoresed. For the antibody interaction experiments, 90 fmol of ERβ was incubated for 10 min at 25 °C with a 32P-labeled probe containing the A2, pS2, B1, or OT ERE, followed by addition of a phosphate-buffered saline control or anti-ERβ antibody CWK-F12 or UICK-98 (kindly provided by B.

Edwards, University of Colorado Health Science Center, Denver, CO). The reactions were incubated for 10 min at 25 °C and separated on a nondenaturing acrylamide gel. Protease sensitivity and antibody interaction experiments were repeated at least three times and produced similar results. DNA pull-down assays were carried out as described previously (21Wood J.R. Likhite V.S. Loven M.A. Nardulli A.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1114-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Briefly, 4 pmol of annealed oligonucleotides containing the A2, pS2, B1, or OT ERE or a nonspecific sequence was immobilized on streptavidin paramagnetic beads (Dynal, Inc., Lake Success, NY). The immobilized DNA was then incubated with 4 pmol of baculovirus-expressed purified ERβ and 1 μmE2 for 10 min. U2-OS nuclear extracts prepared as described previously for HeLa nuclear extracts (21Wood J.R. Likhite V.S. Loven M.A. Nardulli A.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1114-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) were added to the reaction. Following a 4-h incubation at 4 °C, the beads were washed, and proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer. After Western analysis, autoradiograms were optically scanned and quantitated using ImageQuant Version 5.0 software. Since binding of ERβ varied slightly between the different EREs, the association of the coactivator was normalized to the amount of ERE-bound receptor by dividing the level of coactivator bound by the level of ERβ bound. Coactivator/ER ratios from four independent experiments were combined. To minimize interexperimental variation, each coactivator/ER ratio was divided by the mean coactivator/ER ratio for that experiment and multiplied by the mean coactivator/ER ratio for all experiments.

U2-OS cells were transfected with an ERE-containing CAT reporter plasmid, an ERβ expression vector, and a CMV-βgal control plasmid and exposed to ethanol vehicle or E2. CAT assays were performed and normalized for transfection efficiency. As shown in Fig.1, ERβ was able to significantly induce transcription through all four EREs in the presence of estrogen compared with vehicle controls (p < 0.01). However, ERβ increased transcription to the highest degree (7.3-fold) through the A2 ERE, to an intermediate degree through the OT ERE (5.0-fold), and to the lowest degree through the pS2 and B1 EREs (2.4- and 1.9-fold, respectively). These findings indicate that ERβ increases transcription of reporter plasmids containing EREs with subtle differences in nucleotide sequence to different extents. Interestingly, although similar levels of transcription were previously observed with the A2, pS2, and OT ERE-containing reporter plasmids in Chinese hamster ovary cells, transcription of the B1 ERE-containing reporter plasmid was not increased in the presence of E2 (28Loven M.A. Wood J.A. Nardulli A.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 181: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), suggesting that the B1 ERE may be differentially regulated by ERβ in different cell contexts. Studies with other nuclear receptors have suggested that subtle differences in nucleotide sequence can alter the conformation of DNA-bound receptors and thereby influence transcription activation (20Wood J.R.

To determine whether ERβ conformation was altered when bound to different ERE sequences, protease sensitivity assays were carried out. Baculovirus-expressed purified ERβ was combined with32P-labeled DNA fragments containing the A2, pS2, B1, or OT ERE. Increasing concentrations of proteinase K, which cleaves at aliphatic and aromatic residues, were added to the ERβ-DNA binding reaction. The receptor-DNA binding reactions were loaded onto a nondenaturing acrylamide gel and separated. In the absence of protease, ERβ formed a single prominent receptor·DNA complex (Fig.2). A higher order complex, which contained DNA-bound ERβ and an Sf9 protein that copurified with the receptor, was also sometimes observed. Digestion of A2 ERE-bound ERβ produced three slowly migrating complexes (P1–P3), whereas digestion of OT ERE-bound ERβ resulted in two more rapidly migrating complexes (P4 and P5). Digestion of the pS2 and B1 ERE-bound receptors produced a combination of receptor·DNA complexes (P1–P5 and P1, P2, and P4, respectively). A second protease was also utilized to examine amino acid accessibility and to confirm that differences in conformation existed. S. aureus protease V8, which cleaves at glutamic and aspartic acid residues, was added to the binding reactions, and the resulting complexes were fractionated on a nondenaturing gel (Fig.3). Digestion of A2 ERE-bound ERβ produced three slowly migrating complexes (V1–V3), whereas digestion of OT ERE-bound ERβ resulted in two complexes with faster migration (V4 and V5). Digestion of the pS2 and B1 ERE-bound receptors produced two rapidly migrating complexes (V4 and V5) and two more slowly migrating bands (V1 and V2), with a predominance of V4 and V5 for pS2 ERE-bound ERβ and a more even distribution of the four receptor·DNA complexes when ERβ was bound to the B1 ERE. The unique patterns of ERβ·ERE digestion products indicate that there are differences in the availability of ERβ cleavage sites when the receptor is bound to the four ERE sequences and suggest that individual EREs induce specific changes in receptor conformation. To examine whether DNA-induced conformational changes occur in ERβ using another method, antibody interaction studies were carried out. ERβ was incubated with DNA fragments containing one of the four EREs and no antibody, a polyclonal antibody generated against the human ERβ LBD (UICK-98), an ERβ-specific monoclonal antibody that recognizes an epitope at the start of the human ERβ LBD (amino acids 273–285; CWK-F12), an antibody to the FLAG sequence at the amino terminus of the receptor (M2), or an ERα-specific antibody (H151). ERβ formed one major complex with the A2, pS2, B1, or OT ERE in the absence of antibody (Fig. 4, lanes 1–4). As anticipated, addition of the ERα-specific antibody H151 did not affect the ERβ·ERE complexes (lanes 17–20). When the M2 antibody, which recognizes the amino-terminal FLAG sequence of purified ERβ, was added to the reaction mixture, the ERβ·DNA complex was supershifted (lanes 9–12). Interestingly, the trimeric receptor·DNA·antibody complex formed with the OT ERE migrated more slowly than the receptor·DNA·antibody complex formed with the other EREs. This lower mobility OT ERE-bound ERβ·DNA·antibody complex was also observed when the ERβ-specific polyclonal antibody UICK-98 was incubated with the DNA-bound receptor (lanes 13–16). In contrast to the antibody supershifts with M2 and UICK-98, incubation of receptor·DNA complexes with the LBD-specific monoclonal antibody CWK-F12 resulted in differential interaction with the ERβ·ERE complexes (lanes 5–8). The interaction of ERβ with the A2 ERE was unaffected by addition of CWK-F12. Binding of ERβ to the B1 ERE was significantly diminished, and binding of ERβ to the pS2 and OT EREs was completely disrupted. These striking differences in receptor·DNA complex formation with four distinct ERE sequences, along with the differential interaction of the M2 and UICK-98 antibodies with OT ERE-bound ERβ, support the idea that ERβ epitopes were positioned differently when the receptor was bound to the A2, pS2, B1, and OT EREs. The recruitment of coactivator proteins is thought to be an important step in ER-mediated transcription activation (39Robyr D. Wolffe A.P. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 329-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 40Torchia J. Glass C. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). It seemed possible from our protease sensitivity and antibody interaction studies that allosteric modulation of the receptor conformation by different ERE sequences might influence the recruitment of coregulatory proteins and subsequently alter transcription activation. To determine whether association of coactivator proteins with ERβ was ERE sequence-dependent, DNA pull-down experiments were carried out using U2-OS nuclear extracts. As shown in Fig.5 A, these U2-OS nuclear extracts contained substantial levels of TIF2 and AIB1, but did not contain ERβ. For the pull-down experiments, biotinylated DNA fragments containing a nonspecific sequence or the A2, pS2, B1, or OT ERE were adsorbed to streptavidin-linked magnetic beads, and ERβ was allowed to bind to the DNA. U2-OS nuclear extracts were added; the beads were washed; and the ERβ·coactivator complexes were eluted. Recruitment of the coactivator proteins TIF2 (12Voegel J.J. Heine M.J.S. Zechel C. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 101-108Crossref Scopus (943) Google Scholar) and AIB1 (13Anzick S.L. Kononen J. Walker R.L. Azorsa D.O. Tanner M.M. Guan X.-Y. Sauter G. Kallioniemi O.-P. Trent J.M. Meltzer P.S. Science. 1997; 277: 965-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar) to DNA-bound ERβ was quantitated by Western analysis. When oligonucleotides contained a nonspecific DNA sequence, ERβ was not retained on the DNA, and neither AIB1 nor TIF2 was recruited (Fig.5 B, NS). However, when the DNA fragments contained the A2, pS2, B1, or OT ERE, ERβ was bound to the DNA, and AIB1 and TIF2 were recruited to the ERE-bound receptor. Interestingly, although the A2 and OT ERE-bound receptors recruited similar amounts of TIF2, the pS2 and B1 ERE-bound receptors recruited significantly less TIF2 than the A2 ERE-bound receptor (Fig. 5 C). In contrast, the pS2, B1, or OT ERE-bound receptor recruited less AIB1 than the A2 ERE-bound receptor (Fig. 5 D). Differences in coactivator recruitment could not be attributed to the lower affinity of ERβ for the imperfect EREs compared with the consensus sequence since the amount of coactivator recruited to ERβ was expressed as a ratio of coactivator to ERβ for each sample. Given the difference in coactivator recruitment to ERβ on the four discrete ERE sequences, our combined data from protease sensitivity, antibody interaction, and DNA pull-down studies suggest that the conformation of ERβ is different when the receptor is bound to different DNA sequences and that these changes in conformation alter coactivator recruitment. A number of laboratories have demonstrated that TIF2 and AIB1 increase transcription of reporter plasmids containing the A2 ERE (11Hong H. Kohli K. Garabedian M.J. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell.

Proteolytic processing produces numerous forms of human VEGF-D, including fully processed derivatives (containing only the VEGF homology domain), partially processed, and unprocessed derivatives. Proteolysis is essential to generate human VEGF-D that binds the angiogenic receptor VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) and the lymphangiogenic receptor VEGFR-3 with high affinity. Here, we report that alternative use of an RNA splice donor site in exon 6 of the mouse VEGF-D gene produces two different protein isoforms, VEGF-D358 and VEGF-D326, with distinct C termini. The two isoforms were both expressed in all adult mouse tissues and embryonic stages of development analyzed. Both isoforms are proteolytically processed in a similar fashion to human VEGF-D to generate a range of secreted derivatives and bind and cross-link VEGFR-3 with similar potency. The isoforms are differently glycosylated when expressed in vitro.

In contrast to human VEGF-D, the mouse homologue is specific for mouse VEGFR-3; it does not bind mouse VEGFR-2 (15Baldwin M.E. Catimel B. Nice E.C. Roufail S. Hall N.E. Stenvers K.L. Karkkainen M.J.

Studies of the proteolytic processing of human VEGF-D demonstrated that it exists in numerous forms in the extracellular milieu, both in vivo and in vitro. Some VEGF-D molecules are completely processed (i.e. with both the N- and C-terminal propeptides cleaved from the VHD), whereas others are partially processed (i.e. with either propeptide still attached to the VHD) or remain unprocessed (21Stacker S.A.

Proteolysis is important for receptor binding as fully processed mature human VEGF-D binds both VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 with much greater affinity than does the unprocessed form (21Stacker S.A.

The C-terminal propeptide of VEGF-D is cysteine-rich; the location of many of the cysteine residues resembles the spacing of the repeat units found in the Balbiani ring 3 protein (BR3P), a protein synthesized in the salivary glands of the midge Chironomus tentans and which is thought to be involved in the process of forming larval silk (22Dignam S.S. Case S.T. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 88: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 23Paulsson G. Lendahl U. Galli J. Ericsson C. Wieslander L. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 331-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the C-terminal propeptide of VEGF-C, which is highly homologous to VEGF-D and contains BR3P repeats, folds into an independent structural domain that may be involved in establishing a supramolecular structure that regulates the availability of these growth factors in tissues (8Joukov V. Pajusola K. Kaipainen A. Chilov D. Lahtinen I. Kukk E. Saksela O. Kalkkinen N. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). Recent studies of the receptor-binding specificity of the mature form of mouse VEGF-D revealed an unexpected difference from the human homologue, as the mouse protein did not bind mouse VEGFR-2 (15Baldwin M.E. Catimel B. Nice E.C. Roufail S. Hall N.E. Stenvers K.L. Karkkainen M.J. Alitalo K. Stacker S.A. Achen M.G. J. Biol.

Little is known about the structure, proteolytic processing, and biological function of mouse VEGF-D, although it is known to be angiogenic in the rabbit cornea model (16Marconcini L. Marchio S.

Here, we report that alternative RNA splicing generates two different isoforms of mouse VEGF-D protein with distinct C-terminal propeptides. Both isoforms were expressed in all of the adult mouse tissues and at all of the stages of embryonic development that were analyzed. The pattern of proteolytic processing of both mouse VEGF-D isoforms was similar to that of the human homologue. However, the two mouse isoforms were differentially glycosylated when expressed in cells capable of processing VEGF-D. This study demonstrates that RNA splicing, protein glycosylation, and proteolysis are mechanisms for generating diversity of mouse VEGF-D structure. Mouse VEGF-D cDNAs were isolated by hybridization screening (24Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) of an adult mouse lung cDNA library (Stratagene) using as a probe a human VEGF-D cDNA as reported previously (GenBankTM accession number AJ000185) (10Achen M.G.

In addition, a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library of 129Sv/J mouse genomic DNA (Genome Systems, Inc., St. Louis, MO) was screened by PCR using an oligonucleotide primer targeted to intron 1 (5′-ATCAGAATAACCTTAACTAGT) and an antisense primer (5′-TTTCAGTGTCATAGAAAGTT) targeted to intron 2. A single BAC clone was identified. The genomic organization and exon-intron boundaries of the mouse VEGF-D gene were determined by analysis of the lambda and BAC clones by restriction mapping, Southern hybridization with exon-specific oligonucleotides (24Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar), and DNA sequencing. One of the lambda clones, designated M18, contained exons 1 and 2. The other clone, designated M19, contained exons 6 and 7. The BAC clone identified by PCR contained exons 3–5. Total RNA was prepared from 129Sv/ter mouse embryos and adult tissues using the guanidine thiocyanate method as described previously (25Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63144) Google Scholar). To calculate the ages of embryos, the day of plugging was denoted as 0.5-days-old. All embryos were collected at the same time each day to ensure that the calculation of age was accurate. Reverse transcriptase reactions were carried out with random hexamer primers and 1 μg of total RNA using a First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer. 5% of the resulting cDNA was used as template for each PCR. Transcripts encoding VEGF-D358 and VEGF-D326 were detected by PCR using different primer pairs. A 503-base pair PCR product derived from the VEGF-D358 transcript was amplified with a sense primer specific to exon 5, VD358F (5′-GTCCTCATTCCAAGAAACTC), and an antisense primer specific to exon 7, VD358R (5′-GGTAGTGGGCAACAGTGACAG), whereas a 732-base pair product derived from the VEGF-D326 transcript was amplified with a sense primer specific to exon 3, VD326F (5′-GAAGAATGGCAGAGGACCCAA), and an antisense primer specific to exon 6, VD326R (5′-GTGCTTGGACTCTGAGAGAAAAG). For locations of primers in VEGF-D transcripts, see Fig. 3 D. PCR was carried out using AmpliTaq GoldTM DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) under the following conditions: denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s with this temperature decreasing by 0.5 °C/cycle, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s. This profile was followed by 25 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 50 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s. All reactions concluded with a final 7-min extension at 72 °C. PCR products were detected by ethidium bromide staining, and their identities were confirmed by Southern hybridization (24Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) with oligonucleotides specific for the central region of each product. The oligonucleotide specific for the VEGF-D358 PCR product (Oligo358, 5′-CAGATGTCCTTTTCACACCAG) was derived from exon 7 of the VEGF-D gene, whereas the oligonucleotide specific for the VEGF-D326 product (Oligo326, 5′-GTCAATGGTCTTTTCGCTTTCC) was derived from exon 6 (see Fig. 3 D). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-control PCR reactions were performed for all samples to confirm the integrity of the RNA used in the cDNA synthesis reaction. VEGF-D358 and VEGF-D326 were expressed in 293EBNA cells using the vector pEFBOS-SS-Myc-FLAG (see Fig. 4 A) that is a derivative of pEFBOS-SS-FLAG (a kind gift from Claire McFarlane, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Melbourne, Australia) used to tag proteins with two Myc epitopes at their N termini and a single FLAG epitope at their C termini. For the VEGF-D358 expression construct, DNA encoding Arg (23Paulsson G. Lendahl U. Galli J. Ericsson C. Wieslander L. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 331-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) to Pro (358) of VEGF-D358 was amplified by PCR using a sense primer (5′-AGCTACGCGTAGCGAACATGGACCAGTGAAG) and an antisense primer (5′-AGCTGGCGCGCCGGGTTCTCCTGGCTGTAGAGTCC) and a mouse VEGF-D358 cDNA. The PCR product was digested with AscI and MluI and inserted into the AscI site of pEFBOS-SS-Myc-FLAG to generate pEFBOS-SS-Myc-VEGF-D358-FLAG (Fig. 4 A). For the VEGF-D326 expression construct, a DNA fragment encoding Arg (23Paulsson G. Lendahl U. Galli J. Ericsson C. Wieslander L. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 331-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) to Pro (326) of VEGF-D326 was amplified by PCR using a sense primer (5′-AGC TGG CGC GCC GCA GCG AAC ATG GAC CAG TGA AGG) and an antisense primer (5′-AGC TGG CGC GCC GGG GAA AGC GAA AAG ACC ATT GA). The PCR product was inserted into the unique AscI site of pEFBOS-SS-Myc-FLAG to generate the plasmid designated as pEFBOS-SS-Myc-VEGF-D326-FLAG (Fig. 4 A). 293EBNA cells were transiently transfected with purified expression vectors using FuGene6 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Derivatives of VEGF-D358 and VEGF-D326, tagged with the FLAG octapeptide, were purified from conditioned medium by anti-FLAG (M2) affinity chromatography as described previously (21Stacker S.A. Stenvers K. Caesar C. Vitali A. Domagala T. Nice E. Roufail S. Simpson R.J. Moritz R. Karpanen T. Alitalo K. Achen M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32127-32136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The extinction coefficients of proteins were estimated based on amino acid composition using the ProtParam tool program at the ExPASy website (www.expasy.com). Proteins were quantitated by spectrophotometry at 280 nm. The relative abundance of each protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining of serial dilutions of these proteins. Proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions as described previously (24Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). For Western blotting, proteins were transferred to Immobilon P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked, washed, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-FLAG antibody (clone M2, Sigma), as described by the manufacturers, and detection was by ECL (Pierce). For detection of the VHD or Myc epitopes, membranes were analyzed using biotinylated affinity-purified antiserum (VHD antibody, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) raised against amino acids 98–206 of mouse VEGF-D, which corresponds to the VHD, and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) or anti-Myc antibody (clone 9E10, Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Bio-Rad) as described by the manufacturers. N-terminal amino acid sequences were determined using a Hewlett-Packard biphasic N-terminal protein sequencer (Model G1005A, Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA). Samples blotted onto membrane were either loaded directly in the membrane-compatible sequencing column or onto the hydrophobic half of the biphasic sequencer column (without desalting) using the pressure-driven sample applicator (previously equilibrated with 2% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid) by first diluting the sample into 1 ml of 2% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and applying it under nitrogen pressure (40 p.s.i.). Sequence cycles were performed automatically using the Routine 3.0 program employing ethyl acetate chemistry. Amino acids from each cycle were determined and quantitated by their respective elution upon reversed-phase liquid chromatography. VEGF-D358 and VEGF-D326 (500 ng) were denatured in 5% SDS/phosphate-buffered saline for 3 min at 100 °C in a reaction volume of 10 μl. Proteins were cooled on ice, added to a 90-μl solution containing 250 mm NaOAc, 20 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mg/ml Triton X-100, and 0.36 units of endoglycosidase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and incubated for 18 h at 37 °C. As a control, endoglycosidase F was omitted from duplicate protein samples and replaced with H2O. Proteins were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibody. Bioassays for monitoring the binding and cross-linking of VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 involved the use of cell lines expressing chimeric receptors consisting of the extracellular ligand-binding domain of mouse VEGFR-2 or human VEGFR-3 and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the mouse erythropoietin receptor (EpoR). The chimeric receptors had been transfected into the Ba/F3 cell line, a pre-B cell line that survives and proliferates in the presence of interleukin-3 (IL-3) but which dies after IL-3 deprivation. It has been shown previously that signaling from the cytoplasmic EpoR domain of chimeric receptors upon ligand binding is capable of rescuing these cells in the absence of IL-3 (26Pacifici R.E. Thomason A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1571-1574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of the VEGFR-2/EpoR and VEGFR-3/EpoR chimeric receptors in Ba/F3 cells allows detection of specific ligand binding and cross-linking of the extracellular domains of these receptors that result in signaling from the cytoplasmic domain of the EpoR and cell survival and proliferation in the absence of IL-3. The cell lines expressing the chimeric receptors are designated VEGFR-2-EpoR-Ba/F3 (10Achen M.G. Jeltsch M. Kukk E. Mäkinen T. Vitali A. Wilks A.F. Alitalo K. Stacker S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Chem. 1999; 274: 34884-34892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and VEGFR-3-EpoR-Ba/F3 (28Achen M.G. Roufail S. Domagala T. Catimel B. Nice E.C. Geleick D.M. Murphy R. Scott A.M. Caesar C. Makinen T. Alitalo K. Stacker S.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2505-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Samples of VEGF-D were diluted in cell culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 50 mml-glutamine, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 1.2 mg/ml G418) deficient in IL-3. Bioassay cell lines were incubated in the medium for 48 h at 37 °C, and DNA synthesis was then quantitated by the addition of 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine and further incubation for 4 h prior to harvesting using an automated cell harvester (Tomtec®, Orange, CT). Incorporated [3H]thymidine was measured by β-counting (Canberra Packard “Top Count NXT™” scintillation counter, Meriden, CT). To deduce the amino acid sequence of mouse VEGF-D, six VEGF-D cDNA clones were isolated from an adult mouse lung cDNA library. One of the clones encoded a VEGF-D isoform (VEGF-D358), which contains a C-terminal region identical to the region encoded by a previously reported mouse FIGF (VEGF-D) cDNA (11Orlandini M. Marconcini L. Ferruzzi R. Oliviero S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11675-11680Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) and very similar to that for human VEGF-D (10Achen M.G. Jeltsch M. Kukk E. Mäkinen T. Vitali A. Wilks A.F. Alitalo K. Stacker S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). However, the other five clones all encoded a VEGF-D isoform, designated VEGF-D326, with a different shorter C terminus (Fig.1 A). The point at which the two cDNA clones diverge is between the second and third nucleotides of the codon for amino acid number 318, resulting in an arginine residue in the deduced amino acid sequence of VEGF-D326instead of a serine residue in VEGF-D358. The second nucleotide of this codon is number 1235 of the previously reported mouse FIGF (VEGF-D) cDNA (GenBankTM accession number X99572) (11Orlandini M. Marconcini L. Ferruzzi R. Oliviero S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11675-11680Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequences of VEGF-D358 and VEGF-D326therefore diverge after cysteine residue 317. The regions that differ between mouse VEGF-D358 and VEGF-D326 are contained within the C-terminal propeptide. The C-terminal propeptide is predicted to commence at position 211 of the mouse VEGF-D amino acid sequence based on alignment with human VEGF-D (21Stacker S.A. Stenvers K. Caesar C. Vitali A. Domagala T. Nice E. Roufail S. Simpson R.J. Moritz R. Karpanen T. Alitalo K. Achen M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32127-32136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The distinct C-terminal region of VEGF-D358 is 32 amino acids longer than that of VEGF-D326 and contains two cysteine residues, which are located in the fourth BR3P-like motif (C X 10C XC XXXC) (Fig.1 A) (22Dignam S.S. Case S.T. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 88: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 23Paulsson G. Lendahl U. Galli J. Ericsson C. Wieslander L. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 331-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, the distinct region of VEGF-D358 also contains two cysteine residues, which are not part of a BR3P-like motif. In contrast, the C-terminal region specific to VEGF-D326 (residues 318–326 of the VEGF-D326 sequence) lacks cysteine residues and contains only nine amino acids. As cDNA libraries always contain a range of cDNAs with anomalous structures because of cloning artifacts, the existence of the two distinct transcripts encoding VEGF-D358 and VEGF-D326 was investigated further by RT-PCR using oligonucleotide primer pairs specific for each transcript (see “Experimental Procedures”) and RNA from the lungs of embryonic day 15.5 mouse embryos, a tissue known to express the VEGF-D gene (21Stacker S.A. Stenvers K. Caesar C. Vitali A. Domagala T. Nice E. Roufail S. Simpson R.J. Moritz R. Karpanen T. Alitalo K. Achen M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32127-32136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). DNA fragments of the expected sizes were amplified from both transcripts, and the identities of the PCR products were confirmed by Southern blotting analysis with oligonucleotides specific for each PCR fragment (Fig. 1 B). RT-PCR was then used to investigate the expression patterns of VEGF-D358 and VEGF-D326 during mouse embryonic development and in adult mouse tissues (Fig.2). Transcripts for both isoforms were detected at all time-points studied between days 9.5 and 17.5 of embryonic development and in all of the adult tissues investigated. The transcripts encoding VEGF-D358 and VEGF-D326 do not arise from different genes as Southern hybridization analysis of genomic DNA from W9.5 and 129Sv/ter mouse strains using four different restriction enzymes and probes to the 5′ and 3′ regions of the mouse VEGF-D gene detected a single band in each case (data not shown). This indicated that there is only one copy of the VEGF-D gene in the mouse genome. This finding is consistent with the mapping of the mouse VEGF-D gene by interspecific backcross analysis to a single location at the distal end of the mouse X chromosome (29Jenkins N.A. Woollatt E. Crawford J. Gilbert D.J. Baldwin M.E. Sutherland G.R. Copeland N.G. Achen M.G. Chromosome Res. 1997; 5: 502-505PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of the mouse VEGF-D gene was characterized to determine the mechanism of splicing, which gives rise to the transcripts for VEGF-D358 and VEGF-D326. The mouse VEGF-D gene spans at least 28.5 kilobases and consists of 7 exons (Fig. 3 A). The putative signal sequence for protein secretion identified by alignment with human VEGF-D (10Achen M.G. Jeltsch M. Kukk E. Mäkinen T. Vitali A. Wilks A.F. Alitalo K. Stacker S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar) and the first nine residues of the N-terminal propeptide are encoded by exon 1. The VHD is encoded by sequences within exons 2–4, as is the case for the mouse VEGF-C gene. The C-terminal propeptide is encoded by the 3′ region of exon 4 and by exons 5–7. All exon-intron boundaries conform to the consensus splice donor and acceptor sequences (30Padgett R.A. Grabowski P.J. Konarska M.M. Seiler S. Sharp P.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 1119-1150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and are well conserved with those in the VEGF-C gene (31Chilov D. Kukk E. Taira S. Jeltsch M. Kaukonen J. Palotie A. Joukov V. Alitalo K.

https://openalex.org/W1513041431,"EmrE is a small multidrug transporter, 110 amino acids long that extrudes various drugs in exchange with protons, thereby rendering Escherichia coli cells resistant to these compounds. Negative dominance studies and radiolabeled substrate-binding studies suggested that EmrE functions as an oligomer. Projection structure of two-dimensional crystals of the protein revealed an asymmetric dimer. To identify the functional unit of EmrE, a novel approach was developed. In this method, quantitative monomer swapping is induced in detergent-solubilized EmrE by exposure to 80 °C, a treatment that does not impair transport activity. Oligomer formation is highly specific as judged by several criteria, among them the fact that 35S-EmrE can be “pulled out” from a mixture prepared from generally labeled cells. Using this technique, we show that inactive mutant subunits are functionally complemented when mixed with wild type subunits. The hetero-oligomers thus formed display a decreased affinity to substrates. In addition, sulfhydryl reagents inhibit the above hetero-oligomer even though Cys residues are present only in the inactive monomer. It is concluded that, in EmrE, the oligomer is the functional unit.

This is also the case for the solutes' gradients across internal organelles. Their functioning is therefore highly relevant to maintenance of proper cell homeostasis, and they are targets of action of many drugs. In many cases, they are also responsible for failure of treatment of tumors and infectious diseases because of transporter-mediated multiple drug resistance (1Nikaido H. Science. 1994; 264: 382-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar,2Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3545) Google Scholar). The multidrug transporter EmrE, a protein from Escherichia coli, provides a unique experimental paradigm for the study of these transporters (3Schuldiner S. Granot D. Mordoch S.S. Ninio S. Rotem D. Soskin M. Tate C.G. Yerushalmi H. News Physiol. Sci. 2001; 16: 130-134PubMed Google Scholar, 4Schuldiner S. Granot D. Steiner S. Ninio S. Rotem D. Soskin M. Yerushalmi H. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 3: 155-162PubMed Google Scholar). It is a small multidrug transporter, 110 amino acids long, that extrudes various drugs in exchange with protons, thereby rendering bacteria resistant to these compounds (3Schuldiner S. Granot D. Mordoch S.S. Ninio S. Rotem D. Soskin M. Tate C.G. Yerushalmi H. News Physiol. Sci. 2001; 16: 130-134PubMed Google Scholar, 4Schuldiner S. Granot D. Steiner S. Ninio S. Rotem D. Soskin M. Yerushalmi H. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 3: 155-162PubMed Google Scholar). The protein has been characterized, purified, and reconstituted in a functional form (5Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6856-6863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Hydropathic analysis of the EmrE sequence predicts four α-helical transmembrane segments. This model is experimentally supported by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy studies that confirm the high α-helicity of the protein and by high resolution heteronuclear NMR analysis of the protein structure (6Arkin I. Russ W. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7233-7238Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 7Schwaiger M. Lebendiker M. Yerushalmi H. Coles M. Groger A. Schwarz C. Schuldiner S. Kessler H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 610-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The transmembrane segments of EmrE are tightly packed in the membrane without any continuous aqueous domain, as was shown by cysteine scanning experiments (8Steiner Mordoch S. Granot D. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19480-19486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These results suggest the existence of a hydrophobic pathway through which the substrates are translocated. EmrE has only one membrane-embedded charged residue, Glu-14, which is conserved in more than 50 homologous proteins and was shown to be part of a binding site common to protons and substrates (9Ninio S. Rotem D. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 274: 48250-48256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The occupancy of this site by H+ and substrate is mutually exclusive and provides the basis of the simplest coupling for two fluxes (10Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14711-14719Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar,11Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In vivo and in vitro negative dominance studies have been performed to examine the oligomeric state of the protein (12Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31044-31048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Co-expression of wild type and non-functional mutants of EmrE resulted in a reduction in the resistance conferred by the transporter. In addition, co-reconstitution of purified non-functional mutants of EmrE with wild type EmrE in proteoliposomes inhibited the wild type transport activity in a dose-dependent manner (12Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31044-31048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The results suggested that this inhibition is due to the formation of mixed oligomers in which the presence of nonfunctional subunits cause inactivation. The oligomeric nature of EmrE is further supported by the finding that detergent-solubilized purified EmrE binds between 0.25 and 0.3 mol of the substrate TPP+1 per mol of protein. These data suggest that an oligomeric EmrE complex may form a single TPP+-binding pocket (13Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Moreover, EmrE was crystallized in two dimensions, and the projection structure reveals an asymmetric dimer (14Tate C.G. Kunji E.R.S. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To further study the oligomeric nature of EmrE, a novel approach was developed. In this method, quantitative monomer swapping is induced in detergent-solubilized EmrE by exposure to 80 °C, a treatment that does not impair transport activity.

TA15 cells carrying pT7–32 (over-express untagged EmrE) were grown at 30 °C in minimal medium supplemented with thiamine (2.5 μg/ml), ampicillin and kanamycin (50 μg/ml), and 0.5% glucose to a cell density of A 600 = 0.8. The temperature was then increased to 42 °C to induce the T7 polymerase; 15 min later, rifampicin (200 μg/ml) was added to a fraction of the cells, and incubation continued for an additional 10 min. Then, the culture was shifted back to 30 °C for 40 min. [35S]methionine (1350 Ci/mmol) was added to the cell suspension, and incubation continued for an additional 40 min. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with a solution containing 20 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl, and sonicated three times for 10 s using a probe-type sonicator. Undisrupted cells were removed by centrifugation, and the membranes were then collected by further centrifugation at 213,500 × g for 20 min.

Membranes (7000 dpm/μg protein, 80 μg of protein) from TA15 cells with 35S-EmrE and membranes (420 μg of protein) from TA15 cells that over-express EmrE-His were mixed and solubilized with at least 15 volumes of Na-buffer (150 mm NaCl, 15 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5) containing 0.8% dodecyl maltoside (DM, Anatrace Inc., Maumee, OH).

Washed Ni-NTA beads (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany; 10 μl of beads/12 μg of membrane protein) were added to the supernatant and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. After pelleting the beads, a sample of the supernatant was taken for measurement of35S-labeled radioactivity associated with unbound35S-EmrE. To measure the 35S-EmrE protein immobilized on the beads, they were washed with Na-DM-buffer (Na-buffer containing 0.08% DM) and incubated for 10 min at room temperature with 450 μl of the above buffer containing 150 mmimidazole. [35S]Met labeling was done with TA15 cells carrying pT7–32 (over-express EmrE) with (specific labeling) or without (general labeling) rifampicin. Membranes from labeled cells were mixed and solubilized with membranes that over-express EmrE-His, heat treated, and immobilized on Ni-NTA beads as described above. After elution from the beads, the proteins were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid overnight at 4 °C. The precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation, solubilized with sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by PhosphorImager FUJIX BAS 100. Mixed oligomers of35S-EmrE and EmrE-His were formed and immobilized on Ni-NTA beads as described above. To examine the effect of temperature on the dissociation, the beads were resuspended with Na-DM buffer and exposed to the indicated temperature for up to 4 h. The radioactivity associated with the free and bound 35S-EmrE was measured. To determine the effect of the denaturant detergent SDS, aliquots were resuspended with Na-DM-buffer containing the indicated concentrations of SDS. Proteins immobilized on Ni-NTA beads were assayed for [3H]TPP+ binding essentially as described (13Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Ni-NTA beads were washed twice in distilled H2O and once in Na-DM buffer. The His-tagged proteins were added and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. After washing, the beads were incubated in a total volume of 200 μl for 30 min at 4 °C in Na-DM buffer (pH 8) containing 5 or 12.5 nm [3H]TPP+(27 or 4 Ci/mmol, respectively, Amersham Bioscience). For negative control reactions, unlabeled TPP+ (25 μm) was added. The binding reactions were stopped by separating the beads by pulse centrifugation. The bead fraction was then incubated for 10 min at room temperature with 450 μl of Na-DM containing 150 mm imidazole to release the His-tagged proteins and [3H]TPP+ from the beads. All binding reactions were performed in duplicate. EmrE-His proteins were purified and reconstituted into proteoliposomes, and uptake of [14C]methyl viologen (11.9 mCi/mmol, Sigma) into the proteoliposomes was measured after 5 min essentially as described (19Yerushalmi H. Mordoch S.S. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12744-12748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Each of the experiments shown in this work was repeated at least twice. To develop an in vitro assay for studying oligomerization we used untagged 35S-EmrE that does not spontaneously bind to Ni-NTA beads and unlabeled His-tagged EmrE (EmrE-His). When both are mixed, the degree of oligomer formation is obtained from the amount of radioactivity associated with the beads. Fig. 1 shows the formation of mixed oligomers of 35S-EmrE and tagged EmrE as a function of time at various temperatures prior to immobilization. The degree of spontaneous mixing of the detergent-solubilized proteins at low temperature is very low. Treatments, such as high temperatures, that bring about a reversible dissociation of the oligomer prior to immobilization induce also quantitative oligomer mixing. Thus, the maximal amount of mixed oligomers increases with the increase in temperature. At 80 °C, more than 75% of the 35S-EmrE is associated with the beads, and this value is already maximal after about 15–30 min. At 60 °C, the final yield is quite similar, but the rate of formation is slower and reaches a maximum after 4 h. At 4 and 25 °C, the formation is partial, and only about 10 and 20%, respectively, of the 35S-EmrE is incorporated even after more than 20 h (not shown). This behavior suggests that, with detergent-solubilized protein, exchange of monomers at the low temperatures is very slow. Some heterogeneity in the population seems evident since a small fraction undergoes relatively rapid mixing while the bulk does not. After 4 h at 80 °C there is a decrease in the amount of the mixed oligomers, possibly because of irreversible denaturation, that prevents further specific interactions and thereby oligomerization. Most of the other membrane proteins denature irreversibly already after 15 min as judged from visible precipitation, and they are discarded by centrifugation. While the bulk of the other protein is then removed, practically no loss of EmrE is observed as judged from the amount of radioactivity remaining in the supernatant (not shown). In this experimental paradigm, the heating step is required for inducing dissociation of the oligomer that can then associate randomly with other monomers in solution upon cooling. To show the effect of temperature on the dissociation step independently, mixed oligomers were generated and then exposed to increasing temperatures (Fig.2 A). While only a small fraction (about 10%) dissociates at the low temperatures (between 8 and 20 °C), more than 50% dissociates after exposure to 60 °C, and practically all the oligomers (about 90%) dissociate after 4 h at 80 °C. Immobilization of EmrE-His to the beads is done routinely at 4 °C for at least 30 min. The cooling step is necessary for the association of the oligomers since very little mixing was observed when the immobilization was performed at 80 °C (Fig. 2 B). As is seen from the results, the association process itself is faster than the minimal 30 min required for quantitative immobilization to the beads. Other denaturing agents, such as the detergent SDS, also induce dissociation as a function of the concentration (Fig. 2 C). Already at 0.05% SDS, full dissociation is observed after 20 min. On the other hand, detergents, such as DM, do not induce dissociation even at concentrations as high as 1% (not shown). We also tested other agents that are directly interacting with EmrE, such as protons and substrates. pH conditions at the range between 6.2 and 9 and presence of the substrates ethidium bromide, methyl viologen, and TPP+ (at 200, 200, and 20 μm, respectively) do not induce dissociation of the oligomers (not shown). These results suggest that the oligomeric structure of EmrE is very stable at a wide range of conditions. Detergent-solubilized EmrE binds the substrate TPP+ with high affinity (13Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and upon reconstitution, it accumulates methyl viologen in a ΔpH-driven process (5Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6856-6863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Exposure to 80 °C for 15 min caused only a 20–30% decrease in the ability of EmrE to catalyze either function (Fig.3). It is concluded that EmrE is resistant to this extreme temperature and does not irreversibly denature under these conditions. Therefore, this treatment can be used to induce generation of mixed oligomers and to study their functional properties. The experiments described in Fig. 4 A show that the association of 35S-EmrE to the beads is fully dependent on the presence of tagged EmrE. While mixing with membranes prepared from cells expressing tagged EmrE resulted in association of almost 80% of the labeled protein with the beads (lane I), addition of membranes prepared from control cells without tagged EmrE (lane IV), or no membranes (lane V) caused only a small association with the beads (only 3% of the labeled protein). In addition, also an unrelated His-tagged protein such as the E. coli Na+-H+ antiporter (NhaA-His), induces practically no association (lane III). To show that no other protein components in the membrane are involved or required for the mixing of the oligomers, purified tagged EmrE was used (lane II). Also in this case a quantitative mixing was observed, and about 60% of the labeled EmrE was associated with the beads. To further stress the exquisite specificity of the oligomer formation, membranes were prepared from cells in which over-expression of untagged EmrE was induced but were generally labeled with [35S]methionine (Fig. 4 B, lane I) as opposed to the same membranes in which the labeling was specific (Fig. 4 B, lane IV). Membranes of both kinds were solubilized, mixed with tagged EmrE, and heat treated as described above. After immobilization on the Ni-beads, the proteins were eluted, separated on SDS-PAGE, and analyzed for radioactivity. As seen inlanes II and V, the results are practically indistinguishable, and the bulk of the labeled protein that bound to the Ni-beads, in both cases, is EmrE. The treatment of the generally labeled membranes results in a specific pull down of EmrE and, actually, provides a new way for purifying small amounts of untagged protein. Again, in both cases, binding to the beads is completely dependent on the presence of His-tagged EmrE (lanes III and VI). The small amounts of labeled protein other than EmrE that bound to Ni-beads (lane II) are not dependent on the presence of tagged EmrE (compare with lane III) and probably reflect nonspecific interaction with the beads. It is concluded that the oligomer formation is highly specific: tagged EmrE forms oligomers only with EmrE (35S-labeled-untagged) and can recognize it in a mixture of membrane proteins. Another way to demonstrate the specificity of the formation of the oligomer in this in vitro method is to test whether other proteins will compete with the untagged 35S-EmrE (present only at tracer amounts). As expected, untagged-unlabeled EmrE added at increasing amounts to the mixture prior to the heat treatment, decreases the amount of 35S-label associated with EmrE-His (Fig. 5). The competition was also performed with purified EmrE (Fig. 5, inset). Fifty percent inhibition is detected at about 100 nm EmrE suggesting an approximate apparent affinity for the oligomer in this order of magnitude. This assay was also used to test whether a series of inactive mutants are capable of forming oligomers. We competed between unlabeled EmrE mutants, and 35S-EmrE, at the stage when the mixed oligomers are formed. Addition of increasing amounts of membranes prepared from cells expressing various EmrE mutants (Fig. 5) brought about a decrease in the association of 35S-EmrE to the Ni-beads. The decrease was very similar for wild type and the non-functional mutants: E14C, I11C, T18C, Y60F, and W63F (Fig. 5, the results with only E14C and Y60F are shown for the sake of clarity). The slight differences in inhibition can be accounted for by the different expression levels of the mutants. Therefore, it is concluded that the mutants tested form oligomers with the tagged EmrE with affinities in the same order of magnitude as that of wild type EmrE. These results suggest that the lack of function in the mutations tested is not due to impairment in their ability to form oligomers. Two other Smr proteins from E. coli, EM109 and EM121 (9Ninio S. Rotem D. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 274: 48250-48256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (47) Google Scholar), do not form mixed oligomers with EmrE. Thus, when membranes of cells that over-express these two proteins were added as above, to 35S-EmrE and EmrE-His, there was no effect on the level of association of 35S-EmrE to the Ni-beads (Fig. 5, shows only the results of EM121; the results with EM109 are similar). These results stress again the specificity of oligomer formation as measured in this assay since these homologous proteins (32 and 33% identity, respectively) do not form mixed oligomers. Other homologues with higher sequence identity (41–58%) are capable of forming hetero-oligomers (9Ninio S. Rotem D. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 274: 48250-48256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The in vitro method was also used to examine whether each one of the EmrE subunits functions independently or in a concerted form. Negative dominance studies have suggested that the oligomer is the functional unit (12Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31044-31048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In these studies, oligomers formed by mixing organic solvent extracts of wild type and inactive mutants were shown to be inactive when tested for ΔpH-driven accumulation of [14C]methyl viologen in proteoliposomes (12Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31044-31048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The monomer mixing technique described in the present work and the ability to assay high affinity binding in the detergent-solubilized protein allow us an in-depth analysis of the negative dominance phenomenon. We generated mixed oligomers of EmrE-His and the non-functional untagged mutant E14C, and we showed a dose-dependent inhibition of [3H]TPP+ binding (Fig.6 A). As expected from the previously published experiments, when an excess of E14C membranes were added inhibition was detected, which further increased with increasing amounts of E14C. The nature of this inhibition was additionally studied by analyzing the kinetic parameters of the residual [3H]TPP+ binding at the above ratio of mutant to wild type protein. While EmrE-His binds TPP+ with an affinity of 2.8 ± 1.0 nm (B max= 0.9 pmol TPP+/μg EmrE-His membrane protein) the mixed oligomer shows a biphasic behavior: K d 1 = 1.9 nm and K d 2 = 40.7 nm,B max = 0.08 and 0.39 pmol TPP+/μg EmrE-His membrane protein, respectively (Fig. 6 B). These results demonstrate that the mixing brings about a decrease in the total amount of binding sites (from 0.9 to 0.47) and that most of the remaining binding sites display a lower affinity to TPP+. Therefore, in this experiment at least three discrete populations are distinguished based on their ability to bind TPP+: one similar to wild type, one with a 20-fold lower affinity, and a nonfunctional one. These findings suggest that hetero-oligomers with a certain ratio of E14C:WT bind TPP+with different kinetic properties. To further characterize this population and to try to detect hetero-oligomers with potentially different affinities, we designed a more sensitive protocol. Thus, we performed the reverse experiment in which the tagged protein is the inactive E14C mutant, while the untagged is the wild type. As previously shown, E14C does not bind TPP+ (Fig.7). Mixing with increasing amounts of the untagged wild type EmrE results in a dose-dependent increase of the TPP+ binding that levels off at a 4-fold excess (Fig. 7). In these experiments we detected only a single affinity of TPP+ to the hetero-oligomers that was 36 nm, practically identical to that observed in the inverse experiments in which EmrE-His binding was inhibited with saturating amounts of E14C. The affinity was identical whether determined at a 1:1 or a 10:1 ratio WT:E14C. These findings demonstrate that the amount of the species that binds with low affinity increases with increasing amounts of wild type membranes. It is suggested that this is the population with a single Cys at position 14. We were not able to identify multiple affinities, suggesting that hetero-oligomers with more than one Cys residue at position 14 bind with very low affinities or are non functional. The experiments described above support the notion that the functional properties of the oligomer are a result of the interaction between individual monomers. An elegant proof of this contention is provided in experiments in which a functional hetero-oligomer is generated so that it contains Cys residues only in the inactive monomer. This is achieved when tagged E14C was mixed with untagged Cys-less EmrE. When this species is challenged with the sulfhydryl reagentN-ethylmaleimide (NEM), a dose dependent inhibition is observed (Fig. 8). A 60% inhibition is observed at 100 μm NEM that increases to about 75% at 300 μm NEM and levels off thereafter. The remaining binding activity (about 25%) shows a decreased affinity to TPP+ of about 90 nm. Neither the wild type nor Cys-less EmrE are significantly inhibited by NEM even at 1 mm. We conclude that NEM reacts with Cys at position 14 in the inactive mutant and affects the affinity of the oligomer. The oligomeric state of ion-coupled transporters has been investigated in a number of cases. The approaches used are based on analysis of the particle size of the protein in the membrane (20Friesen R.H. Knol J. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33527-33535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 21Eskandari S. Kreman M. Kavanaugh M.P. Wright E.M. Zampighi G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2000; 97: 3106-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Evidence for oligomer formation has been presented in many instances, and the functional relevance of the oligomerization has been documented in a few cases (18Gerchman Y. Rimon A. Venturi M. Padan E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3403-3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 22Schroers A. Burkovski A. Wohlrab H. Kramer R. J. Biol.

The results presented here describe a novel in vitro system for the study of oligomerization and its functional implications. EmrE oligomers are stable in the detergent-solubilized preparation and dissociate only after exposure to high temperature or strong denaturing reagents such as the detergent SDS. An experimental protocol for generating mixed oligomers was designed based on an initial dissociation step induced by exposure to high temperature for short periods and random and rapid association of the monomers in solution at a lower temperature. The exposure to high temperature had little effect on either substrate binding or ΔpH-driven uptake in proteoliposomes. EmrE provides, therefore, a unique experimental paradigm not only because of its size but also because of its stability to denaturing agents such as temperature, organic solvents (5Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6856-6863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), and SDS-urea (3Schuldiner S. Granot D. Mordoch S.S. Ninio S. Rotem D. Soskin M. Tate C.G. Yerushalmi H. News Physiol. Sci. 2001; 16: 130-134PubMed Google Scholar). The results demonstrate that EmrE forms homo-oligomers since35S-EmrE binds to Ni-NTA beads only through formation of oligomers with EmrE-His. No other proteins seem to be required for this process because oligomerization is detected also when purified EmrE-His is used. In addition, competition experiments were performed with unlabeled untagged wild type EmrE showing an apparent affinity of interaction in the 100–200 nm range. Oligomer formation appears to be exquisitely specific as no formation is detected with unrelated tagged membrane proteins such as NhaA-His and even with other Smr proteins from E. coli that show a distinct homology to EmrE. The lack of interaction of EmrE with other Smr proteins fromE. coli supports the contention that EmrE is functionalin vivo only as a homo-oligomer. In the case of Smr proteins from other organisms, it has been suggested that they can function as hetero-oligomers based on a synergistic effect on resistance phenotype when two proteins are co-expressed (25Lee A. Mao W. Warren M.S. Mistry A. Hoshino K. Okumura R. Ishida H. Lomovskaya O. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3142-3150Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 26Jack D.L. Storms M.L. Tchieu J.H. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2311-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that the basic oligomeric structure detected in two-dimensional crystals of EmrE is a dimer (14Tate C.G. Kunji E.R.S. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), but it is possible that the functional unit of the protein is a higher degree oligomer formed by two or more dimers. Previous evidence from negative dominance experiments and from ligand binding measurement to purified EmrE were consistent with a trimeric structure but did not rule out the possibility that EmrE functions as a dimer or a tetramer (12Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31044-31048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 13Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The experiments described here demonstrate that in the mixed oligomers the inhibitory effect of E14C is on the substrate binding site. The kinetic analysis of this effect revealed three distinct species based on their binding properties: one similar to wild type, one with a 20-fold lower affinity, and a nonfunctional one. These findings suggest that hetero-oligomers with one Cys residue at position 14 bind TPP+ with different kinetic properties. To further characterize this population and to try to detect hetero-oligomers with potentially different affinities, we designed a more sensitive protocol. In these experiments, the tagged protein is the inactive E14C mutant, while the untagged is the wild type. The functional complementation detected reveals only one functional species with a low affinity identical to the one measured in the negative dominance experiments. In our most recent model, it was suggested that the carboxyl moieties at position 14 are in close proximity and form a charge cluster (10Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14711-14719Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 11Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the negative charge being essential for substrate binding. The results described above suggest that replacing one of the charges in this site has a marked effect on the affinity toward the substrate, while replacing more than one, yields a non-functional protein. That the binding site is contributed by each of the subunits was demonstrated also by experiments in which a hetero-oligomer with Cys residues only in the inactive monomer was challenged with NEM, a sulfhydryl reagent. NEM inhibited the activity of this hetero-oligomer even though it does not have any effect on the activity of the wild type. Therefore, the inhibitory effect described must be due to an interaction with the Cys residue at position 14 in the inactive subunit. NEM inhibits the activity by lowering even further the affinity (90 nm), and it may be doing so by modifying the environment around the cluster. This novel finding allows insertion of various compounds to further probe the binding site. The novel method described here for generation of mixed oligomers has provided significant information on the functional size of the protein. It also allows generation of hetero-oligomers with desired compositions, and it could be of general use with other proteins as well. In addition, as was shown here, we have developed an unexpected means to gain access to the vicinity of the binding site. We thank Michal Sharoni for performing some of the experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2071347412,"Induced expression of heat shock proteins (Hsps) plays a central role in promoting cellular survival after environmental and physiological stress. We have previously shown that scrapie-infected mouse neuroblastoma (ScN2a) cells fail to induce the expression of Hsp72 and Hsp28 after various stress conditions. Here we present evidence that this impaired stress response is due to an altered regulation of HSF1 activity. Upon stress in ScN2a cells, HSF1 was converted into hyperphosphorylated trimers but failed to acquire transactivation competence. A kinetic analysis of HSF1 activation revealed that in ScN2a cells trimer formation after stress was efficient, but disassembly of trimers proceeded much faster than in the uninfected cell line. Geldanamycin, a Hsp90-binding drug, significantly delayed disassembly of HSF1 trimers after a heat shock and restored stress-induced expression of Hsp72 in ScN2a cells. Heat-induced Hsp72 expression required geldanamycin to be present; following removal of the drug ScN2a cells again lost their ability to mount a stress response. Thus, our studies show that a defective stress response can be pharmacologically restored and suggest that the HSF1 deactivation pathway may play an important role in the regulation of Hsp expression.

In addition to preventing proteotoxic damage, Hsps also appear to be involved in antiapoptotic pathways (7Buzzard K.A. Giaccia A.J. Killender M. Anderson R.L. J. Biol.

In the nervous system, Hsps are thought to play an important role in a variety of pathophysiological states, including neurodegenerative diseases, cerebral ischemia, epilepsy, and trauma.

Aged cells and cells affected by age-related diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and prion diseases) are characterized by an increased amount of abnormally folded proteins. If the stress response were functional in these cells, Hsp72 would be expressed permanently at high levels and may interfere with the apoptotic program and thereby with the elimination of diseased cells (14Gabai V.L.

Notably, the threshold for stress induction is significantly raised in cells exposed to a prolonged (moderate) stress (Ref. 15Baler R. Welch W.J. Voellmy R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1151-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar and references therein). At the molecular level, the different physiological and environmental stressors are integrated through the activation of a single transcription factor, the heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1). In unstressed mammalian cells, HSF1 exists in an inert nontrimeric form. In response to stress HSF1 assembles into homotrimers, binds to specific heat shock element (HSE) sequences present within inducible Hsp genes, and becomes hyperphosphorylated (reviewed in Refs. 16Wu C.

HSF1 trimer assembly is negatively regulated by the molecular chaperone Hsp90 (26Ali A. Bharadwaj S. O'Carroll R. Ovsenek N. Mol. Cell.

Repression of the last step of HSF1 activation that ultimately leads to transactivation-competent factor appears to be mediated through a regulatory domain defined by Greenet al. (30Green M.

Scrapie-infected mouse neuroblastoma (ScN2a) cells have proved useful to study certain aspects of prion diseases in cell culture. In contrast to uninfected N2a cells ScN2a cells propagate mouse prions and accumulate intracellular protein aggregates composed of proteinase K (PK)-resistant PrPSc. We previously reported that stress-induced expression of Hsp72 and Hsp28 is impaired in a ScN2a cell line, whereas uninfected N2a cells can mount an effective stress response (39Tatzelt J. Zuo J.R.

In this study, we show that HSF1 trimers formed in ScN2a cells after stress are rapidly disassembled and lack transactivation competence. We demonstrate that the Hsp90-binding drug geldanamycin corrects the defective regulation of HSF1 activity after heat stress in ScN2a cells. Expression constructs for wtHSF1, ΔHSF1, HSE-Luc, β-galactosidase, and GRE-Luc were described previously (24Zuo J. Rungger D. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell.

Polyclonal anti-PrP antiserum A4 was raised against recombinant full-length PrP that was expressed and purified from bacteria (42Winklhofer K.F. Tatzelt J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The mouse monoclonal antibody specific for inducible Hsp72 (C92) has been characterized previously (43Welch W.J. Suhan J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2035-2052Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The mouse monoclonal antibody N27 (clone N27F3-4) that identifies both the inducible and the constitutive form of Hsp70, the rabbit polyclonal antibody against Hsp90 (clone 2D12), and the mouse monoclonal antibody against Hsp90 (clone AC88) were purchased from StressGen, and the mouse monoclonal antibody specific for p23 (clone JJ3) was purchased from Affinity Bioreagents. N2a and ScN2a cells were grown in minimum essential Eagle's medium supplemented with antibiotics (1 unit/ml penicillin G and 1 mg/ml streptomycin) and 10% fetal calf serum. N2a cells are an immortalized neuroblastoma cell line (ATCC number CCl 131). ScN2a cells were established by infecting N2a cells with an enriched preparation of prions isolated from the brains of scrapie-infected mice. One day before transfection, the cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/35-mm plate in supplemented medium. The cells were transfected by a liposome-mediated method using LipofectAMINE PlusTM Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). In brief, 1 μg of plasmid DNA was precomplexed with 6 μl of Plus Reagent in 100 μl of Optimem (Life Technologies, Inc.) at room temperature for 15 min. 8 μl of LipofectAMINE in 100 μl of Optimen were added and incubated for another period of 15 min. After adding 800 μl of Optimem, the DNA-liposome-Optimem mixture was poured onto the rinsed cells. After incubation of cells at 37 °C for 3 h, 1 ml of supplemented medium was added. For a heat shock cell culture, dishes were placed in a water bath for the time and temperature indicated. Geldanamycin was dissolved in Me2SO, added to the cells 2 h prior to a heat shock, and removed after 3 h. The controls were treated with Me2SO alone. As described by Tatzelt et al. (44Tatzelt J. Prusiner S.B. Welch W.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6363-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), the cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), scraped from the plate, pelleted by centrifugation, and lysed in cold buffer A (0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate in PBS). The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C; the supernatants and pellets were examined by immunoblotting. N2a and ScN2a cells were lysed as described above. To the lysate (50 μg of total protein) proteinase K (1 μg) was added, and the samples were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of Pefabloc SC (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and boiling in Laemmli sample buffer. Residual PrP was detected by Western blotting. Detergent-fractionated cell lysates were size fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (Protran BA 85, Schleicher & Schüll) by electroblotting. The nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBST (PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20) for 30 min at room temperature and subsequently incubated with primary antibody in PBST for 16 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing with PBST, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 40 min at room temperature. Following washing with PBST, the antigen was detected with the enhanced chemoluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as specified by the manufacturer. 1 μg of reporter plasmid (HSE-Luc or GRE-Luc) was transfected into N2a and ScN2a cells. 24 h after transfection, the cells were heat shocked (HSE-Luc) or incubated with dexamethasone (10 nm; Sigma) (GRE-Luc) and further incubated at 37 °C for 16 h cells. Luciferase activity of cell lysates was determined luminometrically by a luciferase assay system (Promega) as specified by the manufacturer. For the analysis of ΔHSF-induced activation, the reporter plasmid HSE-luc was co-transfected with 1 μg of effector plasmid coding for ΔHSE. 48 h after transfection the cells were assayed for luciferase activity. Transfection efficiencies were normalized by co-transfection of a plasmid expressing β-galactosidase under control of a cytomegalovirus promoter. β-Galactosidase activity was determined spectrophotometrically by a β-galactosidase enzyme assay system (Promega). All transfections were performed repeatedly and in triplicate. Cytosolic RNA was isolated using a commercially available kit (RNeasy mini kit; Qiagen). For each sample, 5 μg of cytoplasmatic RNA were separated electrophoretically on a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel, transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane (Hybond N+; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and cross-linked by UV irradiation. For hybridization the nylon membranes were prehybridized in hybridization buffer (5× SSC, 10× Denhardt's solution, 50% formamide, 1% SDS, 1% bovine serum albumin, 200 mg/ml denaturated salmon sperm DNA) at 45 °C for 2 h, followed by an incubation in hybridization buffer with a probe containing the32P-labeled DNA probe specific for Hsp72 (45Hunt C. Morimoto R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6455-6459Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar) or mouse PrP overnight at 45 °C. The probe was prepared by using the random primed DNA synthesis (oligolabeling kit; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After washing with 2× SSC, 1% SDS and 0.2× SSC, 1% SDS for several times at 50 °C, hybridization signals were detected by autoradiography. Preparation of cell extracts and gel shift assays were performed as previously described by Baler et al. (46Baler R. Dahl G. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2486-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts were prepared by freezing pellets of PBS-washed cells in liquid nitrogen. After thawing the pellet was resuspended in two packed cell volumes of buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg leupeptin/ml, 0.01 unit aprotinin/ml, 25% glycerol, 0.1% Igepal CA-630; Sigma), and the concentration of NaCl was adjusted to 0.38 m. After 10 min of incubation on ice, the extract was centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 10,000 × g. For the binding reaction 20 μg of protein was added to 10 μl of 2× Kingston buffer (24 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 120 mmKCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.24 mm EDTA, 0.6 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.6 mmdithiothreitol, and 24% glycerol), 1 μl of sonicated salmon sperm DNA (1 mg/ml), 1 μl of poly(dI-dC) (1 mg/ml), and 1.75 pmol of32P-labeled, double-stranded HSE oligonucleotide (47Goldenberg C.J. Luo Y. Fenna M. Baler R. Weinmann R. Voellmy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19734-19739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The final volume of the mixture was adjusted to 20 μl with water. Double-stranded HSE oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and purified on a Micro Bio-Spin 30 column (Bio-Rad). Following binding at room temperature for 20 min the mixtures were loaded onto nondenaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 TBE (45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA). Gels were electrophoresed for 2.5 h at 150 V, dried, and exposed for autoradiography. N2a and ScN2a cells were grown on glass coverslips and fixed by immersion in cold methanol for 10 min. The fixed cells were incubated with the anti-Hsp72 antibody C92 (dilution of 1:50) or with the monoclonal anti-Hsp90 antibody (dilution of 1:100) in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 45 min at 37 °C. After extensive washing with PBS, an incubation with rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies (Dianova) (dilution 1:200) followed at 37 °C for 30 min. The washed coverslips were mounted onto glass slides and examined by phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy. ScN2a cells provide a system to study the accumulation of infectious PrPSc in cell culture (48Borchelt D.R. Taraboulos A. Prusiner S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16188-16199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Butler D.A. Scott M.R.D. Bockman J.M. Borchelt D.R. Taraboulos A. Hsiao K.K. Kingsbury D.T. Prusiner S.B. J.

In addition to productive propagation of detergent insoluble, PK-resistant, and infectious PrPSc, the same cells were described by us to be impaired in the stress-induced expression of Hsp72 and Hsp28 (39Tatzelt J. Zuo J.R. Voellmy R. Scott M. Hartl U. Prusiner S.B. Welch W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2944-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It is important to note that the deregulated stress response in ScN2a cells was restricted to the two most highly inducible stress proteins Hsp72 and Hsp28; exposure of ScN2a cells to various stress conditions resulted in increased expression of Hsp73, Hsp90, grp75, grp78(BiP), and grp94, as determined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (see Fig. 2 in Ref. 39Tatzelt J. Zuo J.R. Voellmy R. Scott M. Hartl U. Prusiner S.B. Welch W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2944-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The deregulated expression of Hsp72 in ScN2a cells is again illustrated by the experiment shown in Fig. 1. Three independently established ScN2a cell lines were analyzed with respect to propagation of PrPSc and expression of Hsp72 subsequent to heat treatment. In contrast to uninfected N2a cells, all of the three ScN2a cell lines harbored significant amounts of detergent-insoluble (Fig.1 A, − PK) and PK-resistant PrPSc(Fig. 1 A, + PK). After thermal challenge (44 °C, 20 min), only N2a cells but none of the ScN2a cell lines expressed inducible Hsp72 (Fig. 1 A, α-Hsp72) and Hsp28 (data not shown). Thus, at least three different ScN2a cell lines showed defective expression of the two inducible stress proteins Hsp72 and Hsp28. To rule out that expression levels of proteins that are involved in the regulation of HSF1 activity were different in N2a and ScN2a cells, we performed a Western blot analysis with antibodies against Hsp73, Hsp90, and p23. As shown in Fig. 1 B, no obvious differences could be detected in the relative amounts of the respective proteins. This analysis also indicated that in ScN2a cells the apparent lack of Hsp72 expression after stress is not accompanied by increased constitutive levels of Hsp73, which could compensate for the impaired Hsp72 expression. The following experiments, which attempt to analyze the underlying mechanism, were carried out using ScN2a cell line I. We have previously shown that trimeric, hyperphosphorylated HSF1 formed in heat-shocked ScN2a cells failed to transactivate the major Hsp72 gene (39Tatzelt J. Zuo J.R. Voellmy R. Scott M. Hartl U. Prusiner S.B. Welch W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2944-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To test the possibility that a defect in the endogenous Hsp72 gene was responsible for the absence of induced Hsp72 expression, we performed transient transfection experiments with a DNA construct (HSE-Luc) expressing firefly luciferase under the control of the highly heat-inducible promoter of the human Hsp70B gene (40Voellmy R. Ahmed A. Schiller P. Bromley P. Rungger D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4949-4953Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were subjected to heat for different periods of time and analyzed for luciferase activity. In N2a cells, luciferase activity increased greatly after heat shock. Levels attained were proportional to the duration of the thermal challenge. In ScN2a cells, luciferase activities were significantly lower than in N2a cells under all heat shock conditions tested (Fig.2 A). Initially, we were puzzled about the activation of HSE-Luc in ScN2a cells, especially under more severe heat shock conditions. This activation was most likely due to the presence of trimeric HSF1 that lacks the competence to transactivate the endogenous Hsp72 promoter but induces a weak transcription from the transfected HSE-Luc construct. Support for this notion was derived from experiments in which N2a and ScN2a cells were co-transfected with HSE-Luc and an expression construct for either wild type (wt)HSF1 or a HSF1 mutant denoted ΔHSF. ΔHSF contains a deletion in the regulatory domain (Δ202–316) and is constitutively active (24Zuo J. Rungger D. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4319-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Co-transfection of HSE-Luc and wtHSF resulted in weak activation of HSE-Luc in both N2 and ScN2a cells (Fig. 2 B,wtHSF). The luciferase activity in wtHSF-expressing ScN2a cells was comparable with the activity in ScN2a cells subjected to a severe heat shock (Fig. 2 A). Of note, overexpression of wtHSF generates trimeric HSF1, which, however, is not sufficient to induce expression from the endogenous Hsp72 promoter (Fig.3 B). We therefore concluded that the weak activation of HSE-Luc in ScN2a cells after a severe heat shock resulted from trimeric HSF1, which is incompetent to transactivate the endogenous Hsp72 promoter. Indeed, HSF1 trimers were generated in ScN2a cells after a heat stress, as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (see Fig. 5 A).Figure 3Geldanamycin restores the stress response in ScN2a cells. N2a and ScN2a cells were grown on glass coverslips, and expression of Hsp72 was determined by indirect immunofluorescence using the anti-Hsp72 antibody C92. A, cells were cultivated at 37 °C (37 °C), subjected to 44 °C for 20 min (44 °C), subjected to geldanamycin (5 μm, 3 h) (GA), or subjected to a heat shock 2 h after administration of GA (GA + 44 °C). Subsequent to the stress treatment, the cells were further cultivated in fresh cell culture medium and analyzed after an additional 16 h at 37 °C.B, ScN2a cells grown on glass coverslips were transfected with a plasmid encoding wtHSF1 or the constitutively active ΔHSF1 mutant (Δ HSF). Expression of Hsp72 was analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence of cells grown at 37 °C (37 °C) or subjected to 44 °C for 20 min (44 °C) as described for A. C, N2a and ScN2a cells were incubated with or without GA (5 μm, 3 h). The expression pattern of Hsp90 was analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence. D, N2a and ScN2a cells were transfected with GRE-Luc and incubated with dexamethasone (10 nm for 16 h. Then luciferase activity of cell lysates was quantified luminometrically.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 5Geldanamycin delays HSF1 trimer disassembly. A, N2a and ScN2a cells were subjected to 44 °C for 20 min (hs +), returned to 37 °C, and harvested at the time points indicated (min after heat shock) by shock freezing in liquid nitrogen. Protein extracts were prepared and probed for HSE binding activity by electrophoretic mobility shift assays.B, N2a and ScN2a cells were incubated with geldanamycin (5 μm, 3 h) (GA + and hs −) or subjected to a heat shock (44 °C, 20 min) 2 h after administration of geldanamycin (GA +, hs +). The cells were harvested and analyzed for HSF1 trimer formation as described for A. The time points are always indicated as hours after geldanamycin treatment. As an example, in the case of co-treatment with geldanamycin and heat shock (GA + and hs +) the 3 h time point (3 h after geldanamycin) was harvested 1 h after the heat shock. C, quantitative evaluation of HSF1 trimer formation in N2a and ScN2a cells measured as HSE binding activity after a heat shock in absence and in presence of geldanamycin. The relative amount of HSF1 trimers present 20 min after the heat shock was set as 100%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Co-transfection of the ΔHSF construct with HSE-Luc resulted in an extremely high luciferase activity in N2a and ScN2a cells even without applying a heat shock. (Fig. 2 B, Δ HSF), Notably, overexpression of ΔHSF was sufficient to induce expression of Hsp72 in ScN2a cells (Fig. 3 B). To verify that the different levels of luciferase activity measured in our stress activation assay reflected stress-regulated promoter activity and not differences in transfection efficiencies or instability of luciferase, two different control experiments were performed. In the analysis shown in Fig. 2 C, a plasmid encoding β-galactosidase under control of a cytomegalovirus promoter was co-transfected. Similar levels of β-galactosidase in N2a and ScN2a cells indicated similar transfection efficiencies. In addition, N2a and ScN2a cells were transfected in parallel with a plasmid coding for luciferase under the control of a constitutive SV40 promoter and treated exactly like the cells analyzed in Fig. 2 A. The results of this experiment demonstrated that activity of luciferase was not different in the ScN2a background (Fig. 2 D). In conclusion, these experiments indicated that ScN2a cells are significantly impaired to induce expression from Hsp promoters using their own HSF1. It appears therefore that the virtual inability of ScN2a cells to induce expression of Hsp72 and Hsp28 during stress is caused by a defect in the activation of endogenous HSF1. To get insig"
https://openalex.org/W2083026048,"Signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) is a transcription factor that is activated by interleukin-4 (IL-4)-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and mediates most of the IL-4-induced gene expression. Transcriptional activation by STAT6 requires the interaction with coactivators like p300 and the CREB-binding protein (CBP). In this study we have investigated the function of the CBP-associated members of the p160/steroid receptor coactivator family in the transcriptional activation by STAT6. We found that only one of them, NCoA-1, acts as a coactivator for STAT6 and interacts directly with the transactivation domain of STAT6. The N-terminal part of NCoA-1 interacts with the far C-terminal part of the STAT6 transactivation domain but does not interact with the other members of the STAT family. This domain of NCoA-1 has a strong inhibitory effect on STAT6-mediated transactivation when overexpressed in cells, illustrating the importance of NCoA-1 for STAT6-mediated transactivation. In addition, we showed that both coactivators CBP and NCoA-1 bind independently to specific regions within the STAT6 transactivation domain. Our results suggest that multiple contacts between NCoA-1, CBP, and STAT6 are required for transcriptional activation. These findings provide new mechanistic insights into how STAT6 can recruit coactivators required for IL-4-dependent transactivation.

In addition, we showed that both coactivators CBP and NCoA-1 bind independently to specific regions within the STAT6 transactivation domain. Our results suggest that multiple contacts between NCoA-1, CBP, and STAT6 are required for transcriptional activation. These findings provide new mechanistic insights into how STAT6 can recruit coactivators required for IL-4-dependent transactivation. signal transducer and activator of transcription interleukin germline cAMP responsive element-binding protein CREB-binding protein, HAT, histone acetyltransferase steroid receptor coactivator glutathione S-transferase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis transactivation domain Per-Arnt-Sim nuclear receptor interaction domain basic helix loop helix activation domain DNA-binding domain, NCoA, nuclear receptor coactivator STAT1 proteins are transcription factors that transmit signals from activated cytokine receptors to the nucleus. Following their obligatory tyrosine phosphorylation exerted by JAK kinases, STATs dimerize and move to the nucleus where they modulate transcription through specific DNA sequence elements (1Darnell J.E.

They share the same structure and functional domains. The N-terminal portion mediates cooperative binding to multiple DNA sites (4Xu X. Sun Y.L. Hoey T.

Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar, 11Hoey T. Schindler U. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Although STAT3 and STAT5 are expressed in most cell types and activated by a variety of cytokines and growth factors, other STAT proteins play specific roles in host defenses (2Darnell J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). In the present study we focused on STAT6, which is activated in response to IL-4 and IL-13, another cytokine that binds to the α chain of the IL-4 receptor (12Smerz-Bertling C. Duschl A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 966-970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). IL-4 regulates immune and anti-inflammatory responses. It promotes the differentiation of T helper precursors toward the Th2 lineage while inhibiting Th1 development. Furthermore, IL-4 stimulation of B-cells triggers Ig class switching to IgE isotype. This recombination is thought to be initiated following the transcriptional activation of the germline (GL) ε promoter, which leads to the generation of the sterile ε transcript (13Jung S. Rajewsky K. Radbruch A. Science. 1993; 259: 984-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 14Zhang J. Bottaro A. Li S. Stewart V. Alt F.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3529-3537Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). STAT6-deficient mice have defects in IL-4-mediated functions including Th2 development, induction of CD23 and major histocompatibility complex class II expression, and immunoglobulin class switching to IgE, demonstrating the essential role of STAT6 in these IL-4-induced functions (15Shimoda K. van Deursen J.

Immunity. 1996; 4: 313-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar). STAT6-binding sites have been identified in the promoter regions of several IL-4-responsive genes. They are best characterized in the Ig GL ε promoter, which contains a composite binding element for STAT6 and the CAAT/enhancer-binding protein (17Delphin S. Stavnezer J. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The transactivation domain of STAT6 was characterized as a modular, proline-rich region in the C terminus of the protein. The structure of this domain is quite different from that of the other members of the STAT family (18Lu B. Reichel M. Fisher D.A. Smith J.F. Rothman P. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1255-1264PubMed Google Scholar, 19Moriggl R. Berchtold S. Friedrich K. Standke G.J. Kammer W. Heim M. Wissler M. Stocklin E. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3663-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Recently studies have mapped two distinct transactivation functions in this domain that cooperate in transcriptional activation (20Goenka S. Youn J. Dzurek L.M. Schindler U., Yu- Lee L.Y. Boothby M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4663-4672PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of transcription in general requires the recruitment of transcriptional coactivators that are part of the chromatin modifying complexes possessing histone acetyltransferase activities and serve as a bridge to the basal transcriptional apparatus (21Hampsey M. Reinberg D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 132-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In previous studies we demonstrated that the functionally conserved coactivators p300 and CREB-binding protein (CBP) are recruited by STAT6 and are required for transcriptional activation by IL-4 (22Gingras S. Simard J. Groner B. Pfitzner E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2722-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). p300/CBP are also recruited by different classes of transcription factors, including nuclear receptors, AP-1, p53, p65 subunit of NFκB, and STAT1, STAT2, and STAT5 (23Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar, 24Pfitzner E. Jahne R. Wissler M. Stoecklin E. Groner B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1582-1593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). p300/CBP possesses intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity and associates with other histone acetyltransferases (HATs) like p/CAF and members of the p160/steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) family (23Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar). The p160/SRC coactivator family, also called the NCoA coactivator family, was identified as nuclear receptor-binding proteins, which enhance transcriptional activation, by these ligand-induced transcription factors (25Xu L. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Three homologous factors, termed NCoA-1, also called SRC-1 (26Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y.

They contain conserved domains for interaction with downstream effectors such as HATs like p300/CBP, p/CAF, and protein methyltransferases (39Leo C. Chen J.D.

Trans. 2000; 28: 415-418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, two members of this family, NCoA-1 and NCoA-3, contain moderate intrinsic HAT activity (42Spencer T.E. Jenster G. Burcin M.M. Allis C.D. Zhou J. Mizzen C.A. McKenna N.J. Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Nature. 1997; 389: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). Several studies have postulated a selectivity in the use of specific coactivators and HAT activities required for the function of distinct classes of transcription factors, e.g.p300 and NCoA-3 are required for STAT1, whereas p/CAF and NCoA-1 are dispensable for this transcription factor (40Korzus E.

Ogliastro M.H. Kioussi C. Xu L. Torchia J. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Science. 1998; 279: 700-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). One important question concerning the function of NCoA coactivators focuses on whether or not the different NCoA cofactors fulfill redundant functions. All three family members possess similar properties in terms of interaction with nuclear receptors and enhancement of nuclear receptor transcriptional activation. However, several reports suggest that their activities are not completely redundant (30Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar, 35Lee S.K. Kim H.J. Kim J.W. Lee J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1924-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Because NCoA coactivators are associated with p300/CBP, which in turn coactivates STAT6, we investigated their influence on STAT6 transactivation. We tested whether STAT6-mediated transactivation requires the activity of specific coactivators. In this paper we demonstrate that NCoA-1, but not the other members of the NCoA coactivator family, acts as a coactivator of STAT6. We found a direct interaction of STAT6 and NCoA-1 in cells and in vitro. Overexpression of the STAT6-interacting domain of NCoA-1 inhibits transactivation by STAT6 in a transdominant manner, demonstrating the importance of NCoA-1 for STAT6 transactivation. Additionally, we showed that CBP and NCoA-1 bind independently to specific parts of the STAT6 transactivation domain. The analysis of NCoA-1 mutants in which different functional domains were deleted demonstrates that coactivation by NCoA-1 requires its activation domain 1 and the STAT6 interaction region. Our results show that STAT6 enhances transcription by directly contacting at least two different coactivators (CBP and NCoA-1) with its modular transactivation domain. HepG2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. They were transfected with Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In a typical transfection experiment 1.5 × 105 cells were transfected with 2 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid, the indicated amounts of expression vectors, and 0.025 μg of SV40 promoter-drivenLacZ expression vector to control the transfection efficiency. After 1 day the cells were induced with IL-4 (10 ng/ml) and lysed after a further 16 h of incubation. The murine pre-B-cell line Ba/F3-IL-4R, stably transfected with the human IL-4R α and γ chains (44Lischke A. Kammer W. Friedrich K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 100-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), was cultured in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and 5% supernatant of murine IL-3-overproducing WEHI cells as previously described (44Lischke A. Kammer W. Friedrich K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 100-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These cells (5 × 106) were transfected by electroporation with a Bio-Rad gene pulser at 350 V/960 microfarads. In a typical transfection experiment 5 μg of luciferase reporter construct, the indicated amount of expression vectors, and 1 μg of SV40-LacZcontrol plasmid was used. The total amount of DNA was adjusted to 20 μg with pBSK. 4 h later the cells were aliquoted into two fractions; one was treated with murine IL-4 (10 ng/ml), and the other was left untreated. 20 h later the cells were harvested. 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. These cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were assayed as recommended by the manufacturer (Promega). Luciferase activities were normalized to the LacZexpression. At least three independent experiments were performed. The reporter genes (GAL4-RE)3TK LUC, N4(STAT-RE)3 LUC, and LacZ expression plasmid (pCH110) have been described previously (19Moriggl R. Berchtold S. Friedrich K. Standke G.J. Kammer W. Heim M.

The expression vectors for murine NCoA-1, NCoA-2, and NCoA-3 (pCMV-NCoA-1/SRC-1, pCMV-NCoA-2, and pCMV-NCoA-3/p/CIP) were kindly provided by Joe Torchia (University of Western Ontario, London, Canada). The expression vectors for full-length rat SRC-1/NCoA-1 (pSG6-SRC-1a) and rat SRC-1/NCoA-1 residues 569–804 fused to six Myc tags were provided by Ludger Klein-Hitpass (Universitätsklinikum, Essen, Germany). The series of expression vectors for murine NCoA-1 residues 1–462, 100–462, and 213–462 fused to six Myc tags were generated by inserting each corresponding region (generated by digestion or polymerase chain reaction) in frame into the StuI/XbaI andXhoI/XbaI sites, respectively, of pCS2+. The fragments containing the NCoA-1 sequence residues 1–571 and 1–787 of pSG6-SRC-1/NCoA-1 were subcloned into theXbaI/EcoRI and XbaI/BamHIsites of pSG6. The constructs containing the NCoA-1 sequence residues 361–571 and 313–462 were obtained by insertion of theEcoRI and PvuII/XbaI fragments of pCMV-SRC-1/NCoA-1 into the EcoRI andEcoRV/XbaI sites of pcDNA3.1/His (Invitrogen). The construct containing the NCoA-1 sequence residues 1–361 was obtained by deletion of the EcoRI fragment of pSG6-SRC-1/NCoA-1. The expression vectors for GST fusion proteins pGEX-AHK and pGEX-KGK were kindly provided by Thorsten Heinzel (Georg-Speyer-Haus, Frankfurt, Germany). The GST fusion construct containing residues 1–787 of NCoA-1 was generated by insertion of the corresponding BamHI fragment of pCMV-SRC-1/NCoA-1 into theBamHI site of pGEX-KGK. The GST fusion constructs containing residues 677–792, 677–847, and 792–847 of human STAT6 were generated by subcloning of the corresponding insert from the series of GAL4-DBD-STAT6 vectors, generated by digestion withEcoRI/NheI, in frame in theEcoRI/XbaI sites of pGEX-AHK. Insertion of all constructs was verified by digestion. Inserts generated by polymerase chain reaction were additionally verified by sequencing analysis. The SRC-1/NCoA-1 deletion constructs pSG5-SRC1e-ΔAD1, pSG5-SRC1e-ΔAD2 (Δ 1053–1123), pSG5-SRC1e-1–1240, and pSG5-SRC1eΔPAS (381–1399) have been described previously (47Bevan C.L. Hoare S.

The full-length pSG5-SRC1e was obtained by insertion of the NheI/BglII fragment of pSG5-SRC1eΔPAS (381–1399) into theNheI/BglII sites of pSG5-SRC1e(Δ 1053–1123). Recombinant cDNAs in the pSG6, pBSK, pCMXPL2, or pCS2+ expression vectors were transcribed and translated in vitro in reticulocyte lysates (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine according to the manufacturer's instructions. GST or GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For binding assays, GST fusions or GST alone (1.5–5 μg) bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with labeled proteins in 200 μl of binding buffer as described previously (24Pfitzner E. Jahne R. Wissler M. Stoecklin E. Groner B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1582-1593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After extensive washing bound proteins were eluted and separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Radiolabeled proteins were visualized by fluorography. Amounts and integrity of bound proteins were estimated on SDS-PAGE by Coomassie staining. 293T cells were transfected with 8 μg of pXM-Stat6 or pXM-STAT6Δ792 and 8 μg of pSG6-SRC-1/NCoA-1 per 10-cm dish. 2 days after transfection the cells were lysed in NETN buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and complete protease inhibitor; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cleared cell lysates were incubated with 2 μg of STAT6 antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), SRC-1 antibody (M341, Santa Cruz) or 5 μl of rabbit serum for 2 h and for a further hour with protein A/G-agarose beads as described previously (24Pfitzner E. Jahne R. Wissler M. Stoecklin E. Groner B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1582-1593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, and Western blots were analyzed with SRC-1 antibody (C20, Santa Cruz) and STAT6 antibody (Transduction Laboratories). Previous studies characterized the transactivation domain (TAD) of STAT6 (18Lu B. Reichel M. Fisher D.A. Smith J.F. Rothman P. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1255-1264PubMed Google Scholar, 19Moriggl R.

Youn J. Dzurek L.M. Schindler U., Yu- Lee L.Y. Boothby M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4663-4672PubMed Google Scholar) and identified autonomously transactivating elements. We have recently demonstrated that the activity of the STAT6 TAD is enhanced by the coactivators p300 and CBP and observed an interaction of STAT6 with p300 and CBP in vivo (22Gingras S. Simard J. Groner B. Pfitzner E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2722-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The region between amino acids 1850–2176 was characterized as the STAT6-interacting domain of CBP. This domain also mediates the interaction of p300/CBP with the NCoA family of nuclear receptor coactivators (33Yao T.P. Ku G. Zhou N. Scully R. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10626-10631Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), which together form a large coactivator complex. To investigate whether the NCoA coactivators are involved in the transactivation by STAT6, transient transfection assays in the IL-4-responsive liver cell line HepG2 were carried out. The cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter construct containing multimerized STAT6 response elements and expression vectors encoding STAT6 and the coactivators NCoA-1, NCoA-2, and NCoA-3, respectively. After transfection, the cells were treated with IL-4 or left untreated. Induction with IL-4 led to a 6-fold enhancement of basal reporter gene expression (Fig. 1, lanes 1and 2). This induction was further enhanced up to 20-fold when NCoA-1 was cotransfected (lanes 3 and 4), whereas cotransfection of NCoA-2 or NCoA-3, respectively, had no effect (lanes 5–8). These results indicate that NCoA-1 is a coactivator of STAT6, whereas the other members of the NCoA family, NCoA-2 and NCoA-3, do not seem to be involved in transactivation by STAT6. The results from our transfection experiments suggested that NCoA-1 has, in contrast to the other CBP-associated NCoA-family members, a specific function in STAT6-mediated transcriptional activation. To analyze whether NCoA-1 can directly interact with the transactivation domain of STAT6, GST pull-down experiments were performed with NCoA-1 and the two other related members of the NCoA family. Equal amounts of GST and GST-STAT6-TAD containing the STAT6 transactivation domain fused to GST were incubated with in vitro synthesized,35S-labeled coactivators. NCoA-1 strongly bound to GST-STAT6 TAD (Fig. 2, lane 7). In contrast, NCoA-2 and NCoA-3 failed to interact with STAT6 TAD (lanes 8 and 9). No binding was observed with GST alone (lanes 4–6). These findings are consistent with the transient transfection experiments shown in Fig. 1, where NCoA-1, but not NCoA-2 and NCoA-3, enhanced STAT6 transactivation potential. Taken together, only NCoA-1 interacts with STAT6 and serves as a specific coactivator for STAT6. Previous studies have characterized the transactivation domain of STAT6 as a modular domain with different transactivation functions that mediates transcriptional activation when fused to the heterologous GAL4-DNA-binding domain (18Lu B. Reichel M. Fisher D.A. Smith J.F. Rothman P. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1255-1264PubMed Google Scholar, 19Moriggl R. Berchtold S. Friedrich K. Standke G.J. Kammer W. Heim M. Wissler M. Stocklin E.

Immunol. 1999; 163: 4663-4672PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated whether NCoA-1 enhances the transactivation potential of STAT6 by contacting a specific part of the STAT6 transactivation domain. Two GAL4 fusion proteins, possessing either the N-terminal part of the STAT6 transactivation domain (amino acids 677–791) or the far C-terminal part of the STAT6 transactivation domain (amino acids 792–847) (Fig.3 A) were used to analyze whether NCoA-1 is recruited to these domains. The GAL4-STAT6-TAD constructs and a luciferase reporter construct containing three GAL4 response elements in its promoter region were transiently transfected into HepG2, with or without cotransfection of the coactivator NCoA-1. Expression of the isolated GAL4-DBD did not result in a significant enhancement of the luciferase reporter gene activity, which was also not affected by cotransfection of NCoA-1 (Fig. 3 B,lanes 1 and 2). GAL4-STAT6 (677) strongly induced the reporter gene expression (lane 3). Cotransfection of NCoA-1 led to a slight enhancement (lane 4). GAL4-STAT6 (792) did not significantly induce the reporter gene activity, indicating that this domain has only a minor transactivation potential when fused to the GAL4 DBD. Surprisingly, cotransfection of NCoA-1 strongly enhanced the transactivation function of this far C-terminal part of the STAT6 TAD to a level as high as the N-terminal transactivation domain of STAT6 (compare lanes 6and 4). To validate this finding and to exclude the possibility that the strong effect of NCoA-1 on the transactivation activity of GAL4-STAT6 (792) was cell type-specific, we repeated the experiments in the pre-B-cell line Ba/F3-IL-4R (Fig. 2 C). Again, GAL4-DBD alone had no significant transa"

Therefore, to study any potential signaling mediated by the receptor(s), it is important to avoid toxin pore formation. As we demonstrated recently, the toxin forms pores by assembling into cyclical tetramers, which insert into lipid bilayers (17Orlova E.V. Rahman M.A. Gowen B. Volynski K.E. Ashton A.C. Manser C. van Heel M. Ushkaryov Y.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). By using a LTX preparation that formed tetramers/pores only in the presence of Mg2+, we selectively studied the receptor-mediated LTX action in synaptosomes (8Davletov B.A. Meunier F.A. Ashton A.C.

Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 453-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and found that LTX-receptor interaction in the absence of pore formation causes norepinephrine (NE) exocytosis that requires both extracellular and stored Ca2+. On the other hand, release of amino acid (AA) transmitters, which mediate fast neurotransmission in the brain, could involve other mechanisms. Therefore, the current work had two main objectives: to investigate the mechanism of LTX-induced release of l-glutamic acid (Glu) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and to distinguish the pore- and receptor-dependent LTX actions. To avoid the toxin pore formation, we employed La3+ (which disrupts toxin tetramers) and a mutant LTX (which is unable to form such tetramers). The use of Botulinum neurotoxin type E (BoNT/E) and bafilomycin A1 (BAF) allowed us to identify true SV exocytosis. We demonstrate that, in the absence of Ca2+, LTX causes predominantly nonvesicular AA efflux. Toxin-evoked vesicular AA release is detectable biochemically only in the presence of Ca2+and is based on two pharmacologically and temporally distinct mechanisms: (i) fast receptor-mediated phase that acts upon readily releasable SVs and (ii) delayed pore-mediated Ca2+ entry that stimulates depot vesicles. Our study confirms the differential regulation of the two vesicular pools and demonstrates the usefulness of mutant LTX for in-depth studies of AA release. α-Latrotoxin was purified from spider venom (19Ashton A.C. Rahman M.A. Volynski K.E. Manser C. Orlova E.V. Matsushita H. Davletov B.A. van Heel M. Grishin E.V. Ushkaryov Y.A. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 453-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Pure BoNT/E was a kind gift of Prof. J. O. Dolly. [2,3-3H]GABA, l-[U-14C]Glu, and45Ca2+ were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.Thapsigargin (TG), BAPTA-AM, and U73122 were from Calbiochem; all other reagents were from Sigma. Rat cerebrocortical synaptosomes, prepared as described (20Ashton A.C. Dolly J.O. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1979-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), were suspended in physiological buffer (PB, containing, in mm: 125 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose, 0.1 aminooxyacetic acid, and 25 HEPES, pH 7.4) supplemented with 2 mm CaCl2 and kept on ice until required. All buffers and suspensions were constantly oxygenated. In the short loading procedure, synaptosomes were incubated with 2–5 μCi/ml [3H]GABA or [14C]Glu at 37 °C for 5 min, washed, and stimulated 20 min later to reproduce conditions used by others (21Khvotchev M. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21451-21454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In thenormal loading protocol, terminals were incubated for 5 min with [14C]Glu and for 60 min with [3H]GABA, washed, and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in PB containing 0.1 mm EGTA (20Ashton A.C. Dolly J.O. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1979-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). During the post-loading incubation, some synaptosomes were treated with: 400 nm BoNT/E (2 h, eliminating 90% of SNAP-25) (20Ashton A.C. Dolly J.O. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1979-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), 100 μm BAPTA-AM (1 h) (20Ashton A.C. Dolly J.O. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 21451-21454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The latter three drugs were also included in subsequent buffers. Control samples were treated identically, using the drug-free solvents. Exposure to PAO did not exceed 25–35 min. In the short loading protocol, PAO was added 10 min before [14C]Glu, and this did not perturb NT uptake (21Khvotchev M. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21451-21454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To evoke release, PB containing a stimulus (with Ca2+ or 0.1 mm EGTA) was added to synaptosomes at 24 °C; basal Ca2+-independent release was determined using stimulus-free PB/EGTA. For quick and thorough mixing and to prevent NT reuptake (20Ashton A.C. Dolly J.O. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1979-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar,25Verhage M. Sandman H.

Neurochem. 1992; 58: 1313-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), synaptosomes (10–25 μg of protein) were diluted by the stimulus 8-fold. Using high K+, maximal release was achieved at 25 mm K+. A23187 in dimethyl sulfoxide was diluted into Ca2+-containing PB 10 s before use. For comparison with superfusion studies where terminals were exposed to LTX for 1 min and release was evaluated over a longer period (21Khvotchev M. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21451-21454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), some samples were stimulated for 1 min and then diluted 5-fold, resulting in subnanomolar LTX present during release measurements. Hypertonic stimulation was done by adding sucrose in PB/EGTA to a final concentration of 150 mm, which induced maximal vesicular release (identified using BAF); higher [sucrose] only intensified nonvesicular NT efflux. To terminate Ca2+-dependent release, EGTA was added to 0.1 mm free concentration. LTX-evoked Ca2+-independent release was stopped by 0.1 mmLaCl3. Sucrose-stimulated samples were returned to isotonic conditions by adding low sodium PB. Prestimulation with high K+ was stopped by dilution with potassium-free PB. Samples were then centrifuged for 30 s, and the supernatant was recovered immediately. The radioactivity of the supernatant and pellet was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Phase 1 of LTX-evoked AA release was measured during the first 2 min for [14C]Glu and 1 min for [3H]GABA or over 5 min in the presence of La3+ for both AAs (both methods gave same results). Phase 2 was determined by subtracting phase 1 from the aggregate Ca2+-dependent release over 5 min (phases 1 and 2). LTXWT and LTXN4C for baculovirus expression (26Volynski K.E. Nosyreva E.D. Ushkaryov Y.A. Grishin E.V. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) were made similar to those described previously (27Ichtchenko K. Khvotchev M. Kiyatkin N. Simpson L. Sugita S. Sudhof T.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6188-6199Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), except no poly-His tags were introduced (for better resemblance of native LTX). The recombinant toxins were purified from culture medium by affinity chromatography on an anti-LTX monoclonal antibody (kind gift of Prof. E. V. Grishin) attached to CNBr-activated Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The toxins were eluted with 1 m MgCl2 and dialyzed against PB. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and data analysis were carried out as described (17Orlova E.V. Rahman M.A. Gowen B. Volynski K.E. Ashton A.C. Manser C. van Heel M. Ushkaryov Y.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). LTX-stimulated influx of45Ca2+ into synaptosomes was measured as described (8Davletov B.A. Meunier F.A. Ashton A.C. Matsushita H.

Whole-cell current recordings were performed 24 h later on isolated cells, using wide-tipped patch pipettes (1.5–3 megohms). Where indicated in figures, cells were perfused at 70 μl/min, using a local multichannel superfusion system. pClamp 6 software was used for experimental protocols and Biopatch for analysis. Whole-cell current traces are shown without leak subtraction, after low pass filtering. Immediately after extraction, 10–12-day-old rat brains were placed in ice-cold oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (also used for recordings) containing (in mm): 135 NaCl, 3 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 10 HEPES-Na, 2 MgSO4, 25 NaHCO3, 25 glucose, pH 7.3. Transverse vibratome-cut hippocampal slices (200 μm) were oxygenated for 1 h at 32 °C and then at room temperature until used. Slices were transferred to a perfused recording chamber mounted on an Axioskop 1FS microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a 40× Achroplan objective. The bath solution (32 °C) was oxygenated by a surface stream of hydrated O2. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, in voltage clamp conditions (−70 mV), were made from CA3 pyramidal neurons using an Axoclamp 2A amplifier (Axon Instruments), at a sampling frequency of 100 μs (12 bits). Patch pipettes (2–4 megohms) contained intracellular solution (in mm): 110 potassium gluconate, 10 KCl, 4 MgCl2, 50 HEPES, 4 Na2-ATP, 0.2 Na2-GTP, 10 creatine phosphate (pH 7.3). After 20 min in the whole-cell mode, perfusion was stopped, and 1 μmtetrodotoxin and 10 μm bicuculline were added to the bath to block action potentials and GABA-induced postsynaptic currents. Spontaneous Glu-induced miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) were recorded for 10–20 min before and after the addition of 0.5 nm LTXN4C. MiniAnalysis software (Synaptosoft) was used to analyze the traces. The values in the figures are the means from several independent experiments done on multiple samples, with error bars indicating the S.E. Statistical significance of differences between control and test values (probability that the values are equal) was assessed by paired Student's t test (p values are shown near the respective points; NS, nonsignificant) or by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample test. To detect synaptosomal release of AAs, we chose a batch (versussuperfusion) method, because it allows simultaneous and fast measurement of multiple samples and improves statistical evaluation of data. This assay yielded results comparable with fast superfusion (6 ml/min) (25Verhage M. Sandman H. Mosselveld F. van de Velde M. Hengst P.A. Lopes da Silva F.H. Ghijsen W.E. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 1313-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). When synaptosomes were incubated with [14C]Glu at 37 °C, a maximal radioactivity uptake was achieved in 5 min (data not shown). Labeled NT, taken up into the cytosol, requires some time to equilibrate with the vesicles. Therefore, in such short-loaded synaptosomes, vesicular release evoked by high K+ in a Ca2+-dependent manner was initially small but gradually increased upon further incubation at 37 °C and then remained stable for several hours (Fig.1 A). In contrast, a Ca2+-independent (probably cytosolic) component decreased with time (Fig. 1 B). For [3H]GABA, the optimal loading/post-loading period was 120 min (data not shown). This optimized (“normal”) loading protocol was used in most experiments below. These results, in agreement with the earlier findings (28Sihra T.S. Nicholls D.G. J. Neurochem. 1987; 49: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 29Wilkinson R.J. Nicholls D.G. Neurochem. Int. 1989; 15: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), suggest that radiolabeled cytosolic NT first enters a limited number of vesicles but, with time, accumulates in a larger SV population. In synaptosomes loaded by the normal procedure, LTX triggered both Ca2+-dependent and -independent AA release (Fig. 1, C and D). To accurately determine the amount and properties of these types of release, secretion had to be terminated rapidly and selectively prior to the separation step (see “Experimental Procedures”). Addition of EGTA instantly stopped the Ca2+-dependent effect of LTX (Fig.1 C) but could not prevent its Ca2+-independent action. We found, however, that 0.1 mm La3+blocked the latter release immediately and completely (Fig.1 D) (3Rosenthal L. Zacchetti D. Madeddu L. Meldolesi J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 38: 917-923PubMed Google Scholar, 30Scheer H.W. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 1590-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). When mixed with LTX before synaptosomal intoxication, La3+ also prevented all evoked Ca2+-independent release (Fig.2, A and B). Measured using this method, the Ca2+-independent AA secretion increased with LTX dose but always occurred at a constant rate. In contrast, the Ca2+-dependent LTX-evoked release was not linear with time (Fig. 1 C) and displayed two temporally separated phases (Fig. 2, C–F). Phase 1 was observed during the first 1–2 min after the addition of LTX and was the only Ca2+-dependent release detectable at low [Ca2+]e (Fig. 2, C andD). At higher [Ca2+]e, a delayed phase of secretion appeared (Fig. 2, E and F), although for [3H]GABA it partially overlapped with phase 1 (Fig. 2 F). Ca2+e requirements of the two phases (Fig. 2, G and H) demonstrate that phase 1 reaches a maximum at 0.2–0.4 mm Ca2+, whereas a full expression of phase 2 requires more than 1 mm Ca2+. Most remarkably, La3+abolished phase 2 of AA release but did not affect phase 1 (Fig. 2,C–F). To compare the rates of the fast Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent LTX actions, we used 5 nmLTX and determined a higher resolution time course. Under these conditions, phase 1 was complete in 30 s, with up to 2.9 ± 0.9% of total [14C]Glu being released within the first 15 s. Importantly, no Ca2+-independent release could be detected at these times, indicating that phase 1 of the Ca2+-dependent component is the fastest type of LTX-stimulated secretion. La3+ blocks two types of LTX-evoked AA release: Ca2+-independent and delayed Ca2+-dependent. In noradrenergic terminals, these release types require the presence of LTX pores (19Ashton A.C. Rahman M.A. Volynski K.E. Manser C. Orlova E.V. Matsushita H. Davletov B.A. van Heel M. Grishin E.V. Ushkaryov Y.A. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 453-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Together, these findings suggest that La3+ inhibits AA release by affecting LTX pores. To examine any direct interaction of this cation with toxin pores, while excluding the involvement of nonreceptor neuronal proteins, we used BHK cells. In such cells transfected with LTX receptors, the toxin induces large pores (9Van Renterghem C. Iborra C. Martin-Moutot N. Lelianova V. Ushkaryov Y. Seagar M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 3953-3962Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Addition of La3+ to the bath quickly inhibited conductance of these pores (Fig. 3 A). This inhibitory effect was fully reversible upon washout, indicating that La3+ acts extracellularly and does not permanently damage LTX. LTX pores are formed by toxin tetramers inserting into the membrane (17Orlova E.V. Rahman M.A. Gowen B. Volynski K.E. Ashton A.C. Manser C. van Heel M. Ushkaryov Y.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and La3+ is likely to block such pores by perturbing the tetramers. We studied the effect of La3+ on LTX structure by cryo-EM and found that only <10% of all molecules in a La3+-treated LTX sample were tetrameric, compared with 90–95% in control toxin (Fig. 3 B). Furthermore, the few tetramers still found in 0.1 mm La3+ were grossly deformed; the shapes and relative positions of monomers became clearly altered, resulting in a nearly complete closure of the central pore (10–25 Å in control and ≤3 Å in the presence of La3+) (Fig. 3 C). Combined, these results indicate that La3+ inhibits some LTX actions by affecting the toxin pores and that both the Ca2+-independent and the delayed Ca2+-dependent components of LTX-evoked AA release rely on the presence of such pores. In contrast, the fast Ca2+-dependent phase does not require LTX pore formation. Because LTX pores are permeable to NTs (10Volynski K.V. Meunier F.A. Lelianova V.G. Dudina E.E. Volkova T.M. Rahman M.A. Manser C. Grishin E.V. Dolly J.O. Ashley R.H. Ushkaryov Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41175-41183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), we checked whether any LTX-evoked release of radiolabeled AAs was caused by leakage through such pores. To identify vesicular secretion, we used two drugs: (i) BoNT/E, which cleaves SNAP 25, a SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factorattachment protein receptor) protein essential for exocytosis; and (ii) BAF, which blocks the vacuolar-type proton pump and prevents NT loading into SVs, thus decreasing measured exocytosis (22Zhou Q. Petersen C.C. Nicoll R.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 525: 195-206Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Both reagents inhibited the Ca2+-dependent AA release stimulated by high K+ or Ca2+ ionophore, A23187 (Fig.4, A–D). Similarly, these drugs blocked the Ca2+-dependent component of LTX action (Fig. 4, E and F). Moreover, both the slow and fast Ca2+-dependent components of LTX-evoked release were abolished (Fig. 4, I–L), confirming their exocytotic nature. In contrast, the Ca2+-independent LTX-evoked AA release was unperturbed in botulinized or BAF-treated terminals (Fig. 4,G and H), implying that the bulk of such release does not occur via conventional exocytosis. Because this type of release strictly depends on LTX pore formation (Figs. 2 and 3), we term it below “LTX-evoked pore-mediated efflux.” To further characterize the two types of Ca2+-dependent LTX-stimulated exocytosis, we asked whether Ca2+ acted as an extracellular co-factor for LTX or was required in the cytosol. Preloading synaptosomes with BAPTA substantially reduced the Ca2+-dependent AA release triggered by high K+ or by A23187 (Fig. 5,A–D), and inhibited both components of Ca2+-dependent LTX-evoked release (Fig. 4,E, F, H, and I). Thus, cytosolic Ca2+ is necessary for all Ca2+-dependent LTX actions. The Ca2+-independent LTX-evoked AA efflux has no Ca2+ requirement, and BAPTA-loaded terminals actually exhibited a larger amount of such release (Fig. 4, K andL). Cytosolic Ca2+ that participates in LTX actions may, at least in part, come from intracellular Ca2+ stores known to play an important role in LTX-triggered release of NE (8Davletov B.A. Meunier F.A. Ashton A.C. Matsushita H. Hirst W.D. Lelianova V.G. Wilkin G.P. Dolly J.O. Ushkaryov Y.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3909-3920Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 18Rahman M.A. Ashton A.C.

Therefore, prior to stimulation with LTX, we depleted Ca2+ stores with TG. As a result, the fast phase of Ca2+-dependent LTX-evoked [14C]Glu release was greatly attenuated (Fig.5 G), whereas the delayed phase was not affected (Fig.5 J). Some intracellular Ca2+ stores can be mobilized by inositol trisphosphate, a product of PLC action. Indeed, inhibition of PLC by U73122 blocked the fast (Fig. 5 G), but not the slow (Fig. 5 J), phase of [14C]Glu release. Importantly, neither TG nor U73122 acted by simply causing depletion of vesicles, which could still be stimulated by sucrose (both AAs; data not shown). Thus, phase 1 may involve PLC-mediated mobilization of Ca2+i , whereas phase 2 is probably triggered directly by Ca2+ entering through the LTX pore. As expected, the Ca2+-independent LTX pore-mediated release was unaffected by TG or U73122, indicating that this pathway does not involve Ca2+ stores or PLC (Fig. 5 M). Thus, the fast phase of LTX-stimulated release did not involve pore formation but required mobilization of Ca2+i , a process that can be induced by receptor signaling (8Davletov B.A. Meunier F.A. Ashton A.C. Matsushita H. Hirst W.D. Lelianova V.G. Wilkin G.P. Dolly J.O. Ushkaryov Y.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3909-3920Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 27Ichtchenko K. Khvotchev M. Kiyatkin N. Simpson L. Sugita S. Sudhof T.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6188-6199Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, a possibility remained that some LTX pores were not completely blocked by La3+. Therefore, to ascertain that phase 1 involves LTX receptor signaling, a toxin was needed that lacked any ability to form membrane pores. Coincidentally, an interesting LTX mutant (LTXN4C) had been described that bound to both LTX receptors and activated PLC but did not cause any Ca2+-independent secretion from synaptosomes (27Ichtchenko K. Khvotchev M. Kiyatkin N. Simpson L. Sugita S. Sudhof T.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6188-6199Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because LTX pores are responsible for Ca2+-independent release (Figs. 2 and 3), we hypothesized that LTXN4C was inactive in the absence of Ca2+ because it could not form pores. To test this hypothesis, we compared the pore-forming activities of LTXN4C and recombinant wild type toxin (LTXWT) by measuring influx of45Ca2+ into synaptosomes. Addition of LTXWT (or native LTX; data not shown) caused45Ca2+ accumulation in the terminals (Fig.6 A). In contrast, LTXN4C did not induce any Ca2+ influx (Fig.6 A). This result was confirmed by single-channel patch-clamp recordings in BHK cells expressing exogenous receptors. LTXN4C was incapable of forming pores in these cells (Fig.6 B), whereas LTXWT, added after the mutant, induced pores very efficiently (Fig. 6 B), indicating that the inability to form pores w"

One of these proteins, EmrE, is an Escherichia coli protein, which has been cloned based on its ability to confer resistance to ethidium and methyl viologen and which has been extensively characterized. More than 60 genes coding for Smr proteins have been identified in several bacteria based on amino acid sequence similarity to the emrE gene. In this work we have analyzed the sequence similarity among these homologues and identified some distinct signature sequence elements and several fully conserved residues. Five of these homologues, from human pathogens Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Bordetella pertussis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and from Escherichia coli, were cloned into an E. coli expression system. The proteins were further characterized and show varying degrees of methyl viologen uptake into proteoliposomes and [(3)H]TPP binding in solubilized membranes. The homologues can also form mixed oligomers with EmrE that exhibit intermediate binding characteristics. A comparative study of various homologous proteins provides a tool for deciphering structure-function relationship and monomer-monomer interaction in multidrug transporters and in membrane proteins in general."

The active form of the bacterial RecA protein is a filament formed on DNA. RecA has no known activities when it is not part of such a filamentous complex.

An understanding of the formation and disassembly of these filaments is thus critical to a broader understanding of RecA function in recombination processes and to an understanding of the activities of many other recombination proteins.Filament formation generally includes a distinct and rate-limiting nucleation step followed by rapid filament extension. RecA filaments are formed most readily on ssDNA,1 where nucleation is followed by extension uniquely in the 5′ to 3′ direction (1Shan Q. Bork J.M. Webb B.L. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Mol.

Prebound SSB inhibits the nucleation step in RecA filament assembly on ssDNA (19Cox M.M. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8523-8532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, once RecA filament formation is initiated, SSB facilitates the subsequent filament extension by removing secondary structure in the DNA (20Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Even though filament nucleation is inhibited by SSB, the same SSB is readily displaced during the extension phase of filament formation. When SSB is overproduced within the Escherichia coli cell, recombination of UV-irradiated bacteriophage DNA is specifically inhibited (21Moreau P.L. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2493-2500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).A net end-dependent disassembly of RecA protein filaments has been observed on dsDNA (11Lindsley J.E. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 695-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 22Lindsley J.E. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9043-9054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and ssDNA (1Shan Q. Bork J.M. Webb B.L. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 519-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Net filament disassembly from dsDNA and ssDNA is observed at neutral and higher pH values. On ssDNA, observation of a net disassembly is dependent upon the presence of SSB and ATP (1Shan Q. Bork J.M. Webb B.L. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 519-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and proceeds at a rate of about 60–70 monomers min−1 at 37 °C. In the EM, filament disassembly on linear single-stranded DNA appears to occur only on one end (1Shan Q. Bork J.M. Webb B.L. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 519-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Because filament extension occurs unambiguously in the 5′ to 3′ direction, and because extension followed by recession at the same end seemed unlikely, we previously argued that filament disassembly must be occurring at the 5′-proximal end (the end opposite to that at which extension occurred) (1Shan Q. Bork J.M. Webb B.L. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 519-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, this supposition was not tested directly. In the present experiments, we were able to label the 5′ ends of a linear ssDNA by adding a duplex region to that end. The results provide a direct demonstration that the RecA filaments disassemble from ssDNA uniquely in the 5′ to 3′ direction.DISCUSSIONWe conclude that RecA filament disassembly proceeds from the end nearest the 5′ end or the end opposite to that at which filament assembly occurs. The results of this study are summarized in Fig.4. Filaments are formed on the DNA early in the reaction, coating the single-stranded region and extending to include the 3′ end of the single strand. The short 90-bp duplex at the distal end is encompassed by the filament and is not relevant to the analysis. The long 1894-bp duplex at the 5′-proximal end of the single strand is not bound by RecA protein to any significant degree in these experiments, because filaments formed at neutral pH nucleate in the ssDNA and are extended in the direction away from this duplex region. Once filaments are formed, they begin to disassemble from the 5′-proximal end. The vacated ssDNA is bound by SSB. Limited renucleation at random sites within the SSB-bound segments occurs despite the SSB inhibition, so that some long filaments can be seen even at late times in the reaction. Disassembly is coupled to ATP hydrolysis, rendering it effectively irreversible. Kinetic analysis has indicated that there is little direct rebinding of RecA protein to the disassembling end of a filament (34Arenson T.A. Tsodikov O.V. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).As we have posited in previous work, the direction of filament assembly and disassembly is the same, and RecA monomers are added largely at one end and subtracted from the other. In the RecA protein-promoted formation of D-loops with linear single-stranded DNA, there is a marked 3′ end-bias noted in many studies (35Konforti B.B. Davis R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10112-10121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Dixon D.A. Kowalczykowski S.C. Cell. 1991; 66: 361-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 37Dutreix M. Rao B.J. Radding C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 645-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Such an end-bias is potentially useful, because the 3′ end used in the strand invasion can be subsequently used as a replication primer. The end-bias simply reflects the presence of RecA protein at a particular end (37Dutreix M. Rao B.J. Radding C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 645-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 38McIlwraith M.J. West S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The directions of RecA filament assembly and disassembly both contribute to a situation in which, in the absence of other factors, RecA protein will always be more abundant at the 3′ rather than the 5′ end of linear single strands.We have suggested that ATP hydrolysis results in dissociation only at the disassembling end, because the monomers there are joined to the filament only by one protein interface, although each of the monomers in the filament interior is linked by two interfaces. However, an exchange of RecA monomers between free and bound forms can be detected under some conditions within the interior of RecA protein filaments (39Shan Q. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 756-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 40Shan Q. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11063-11073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This may be caused by limited dissociation of RecA monomers (or larger units) within a filament followed by a rapid replacement by other RecA protomers. Alternatively, it may reflect the presence of short gaps in the filaments at which end-dependent disassembly and assembly occur simultaneously (Fig. 4 B). The significance of these exchanges for RecA activities remains to be elucidated. The active form of the bacterial RecA protein is a filament formed on DNA. RecA has no known activities when it is not part of such a filamentous complex. Further, the action of several other bacterial proteins appears to be directed, at least in part, to the modulation of RecA filament assembly and disassembly on DNA (1Shan Q. Bork J.M. Webb B.L.

Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Even though filament nucleation is inhibited by SSB, the same SSB is readily displaced during the extension phase of filament formation. When SSB is overproduced within the Escherichia coli cell, recombination of UV-irradiated bacteriophage DNA is specifically inhibited (21Moreau P.L. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2493-2500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A net end-dependent disassembly of RecA protein filaments has been observed on dsDNA (11Lindsley J.E. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 695-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 22Lindsley J.E. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9043-9054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and ssDNA (1Shan Q. Bork J.M. Webb B.L. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 519-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Net filament disassembly from dsDNA and ssDNA is observed at neutral and higher pH values. On ssDNA, observation of a net disassembly is dependent upon the presence of SSB and ATP (1Shan Q. Bork J.M. Webb B.L. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 519-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and proceeds at a rate of about 60–70 monomers min−1 at 37 °C. In the EM, filament disassembly on linear single-stranded DNA appears to occur only on one end (1Shan Q. Bork J.M. Webb B.L. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 519-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Because filament extension occurs unambiguously in the 5′ to 3′ direction, and because extension followed by recession at the same end seemed unlikely, we previously argued that filament disassembly must be occurring at the 5′-proximal end (the end opposite to that at which extension occurred) (1Shan Q. Bork J.M. Webb B.L. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 519-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, this supposition was not tested directly. In the present experiments, we were able to label the 5′ ends of a linear ssDNA by adding a duplex region to that end. The results provide a direct demonstration that the RecA filaments disassemble from ssDNA uniquely in the 5′ to 3′ direction. DISCUSSIONWe conclude that RecA filament disassembly proceeds from the end nearest the 5′ end or the end opposite to that at which filament assembly occurs. The results of this study are summarized in Fig.4. Filaments are formed on the DNA early in the reaction, coating the single-stranded region and extending to include the 3′ end of the single strand. The short 90-bp duplex at the distal end is encompassed by the filament and is not relevant to the analysis. The long 1894-bp duplex at the 5′-proximal end of the single strand is not bound by RecA protein to any significant degree in these experiments, because filaments formed at neutral pH nucleate in the ssDNA and are extended in the direction away from this duplex region. Once filaments are formed, they begin to disassemble from the 5′-proximal end. The vacated ssDNA is bound by SSB. Limited renucleation at random sites within the SSB-bound segments occurs despite the SSB inhibition, so that some long filaments can be seen even at late times in the reaction. Disassembly is coupled to ATP hydrolysis, rendering it effectively irreversible. Kinetic analysis has indicated that there is little direct rebinding of RecA protein to the disassembling end of a filament (34Arenson T.A. Tsodikov O.V. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).As we have posited in previous work, the direction of filament assembly and disassembly is the same, and RecA monomers are added largely at one end and subtracted from the other. In the RecA protein-promoted formation of D-loops with linear single-stranded DNA, there is a marked 3′ end-bias noted in many studies (35Konforti B.B. Davis R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10112-10121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Dixon D.A. Kowalczykowski S.C.

Such an end-bias is potentially useful, because the 3′ end used in the strand invasion can be subsequently used as a replication primer. The end-bias simply reflects the presence of RecA protein at a particular end (37Dutreix M. Rao B.J. Radding C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 645-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 38McIlwraith M.J. West S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The directions of RecA filament assembly and disassembly both contribute to a situation in which, in the absence of other factors, RecA protein will always be more abundant at the 3′ rather than the 5′ end of linear single strands.We have suggested that ATP hydrolysis results in dissociation only at the disassembling end, because the monomers there are joined to the filament only by one protein interface, although each of the monomers in the filament interior is linked by two interfaces. However, an exchange of RecA monomers between free and bound forms can be detected under some conditions within the interior of RecA protein filaments (39Shan Q. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 756-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 40Shan Q. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11063-11073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This may be caused by limited dissociation of RecA monomers (or larger units) within a filament followed by a rapid replacement by other RecA protomers. Alternatively, it may reflect the presence of short gaps in the filaments at which end-dependent disassembly and assembly occur simultaneously (Fig. 4 B). The significance of these exchanges for RecA activities remains to be elucidated.

Hornerin, which has 2,496 amino acids, comprises EF-hand domains at the N terminus followed by a spacer sequence and a large repetitive domain, indicating that hornerin is a novel member of the “fused gene”-type cornified envelope precursor protein family. The repetitive domain of hornerin was found to be rich in glycine, serine, and glutamine. Hornerin was expressed in the tongue, esophagus, forestomach, and skin among the adult mouse tissues examined, all of them cornifying stratified epithelium. In the embryonic mouse skin, hornerin mRNA was first detected on gestational day 15.5 in the epidermis coincidentally with the formation of a granular layer. In accordance with this, hornerin was detected in the granular and cornified layers of the mature epidermis. In the granular cells of the epidermis, the hornerin protein was detected in keratohyalin granules together with profilaggrin. Furthermore, Western blot analysis of the mouse skin showed that the hornerin protein was cleaved during the process of epidermal differentiation, indicating possible posttranslational proteolytic processing as is observed in profilaggrin. Differentiation of primary mouse epidermal keratinocytes with 0.12 mmCa2+ resulted in the induction of hornerin. These results indicate that hornerin is structurally as well as functionally most similar to profilaggrin among the family members and possibly plays pleiotropic roles, including a role in cornification.

The cornified outermost cell layer provides a barrier that resists various insults from the external environment and prevents the loss of body fluid. A complex well organized cell system underlies the cornification process in which the actively growing basal cells differentiate stepwise through spinous cells and granular cells into cornified cells. Formation of a thickened plasma membrane, a cornified envelope, and bundling of keratin intermediate filaments at the lower stratum corneum are the first signs of cornification (1Sun T.T. Green H. Cell. 1976; 9: 511-521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Two protein families mainly contribute to the cornification process. The first family, characterized by relatively small sizes with short tandem peptide repeats in the central region, includes loricrin, involucrin, and small proline-rich proteins (2Marvin K.W.

The Ca2+ binding EF-hand domain shows significant homology with that of S100 proteins (6Krieg P. Schuppler M. Koesters R. Mincheva A. Lichter P. Marks F.

Trichohyalin is expressed mainly in the inner root sheath and medullary cells of hair follicles (10Rogers G.E. Harding H.W. Llewellyn-Smith I.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 495: 159-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and has been shown to contribute to cornification of other cornifying epithelia as a component of cornified envelope (11Hamilton E.H.

Chem. 1998; 273: 11758-11769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Repetin, whose major expression sites are the tongue and forestomach, has also been suggested to contribute to epidermal cornification (6Krieg P. Schuppler M. Koesters R. Mincheva A. Lichter P. Marks F. Genomics. 1997; 43: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Filaggrin, a protein belonging to the fused gene family, plays unique pleiotropic roles in epidermal differentiation. Filaggrin is a histidine-rich basic protein synthesized as a high molecular weight precursor phosphoprotein, profilaggrin (13Dale B.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 491: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 14Lonsdale-Eccles J.D. Resing K.A. Meek R.L. Dale B.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1239-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), which comprises keratohyalin granules in the stratum granulosum. In response to a triggering signal of cornification, profilaggrin is dephosphorylated and proteolytically cleaved into repetitive units, filaggrin (15Dale B.A. Resing K.A. Presland R.B. Leigh I.M. Lane E.B. Watt F.M. The Keratinocyte Handbook. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1994: 323-350Google Scholar). Filaggrin promotes the aggregation of keratin intermediate filaments, resulting in the formation of disulfide bonds among them. Filaggrin is further processed by modification of some amino acid residues and degradation to free amino acids. Chemical modification of amino acids to hygroscopic compounds is thought to contribute to epidermal hydration and flexibility (16Rawlings A.V. Scott I.R. Harding C.R. Bowser P.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 103: 731-741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), whereas urocanic acid from histidine serves as a UV absorber (17Scott I.R. Biochem. J. 1981; 194: 829-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The functional significance of filaggrin has also been indicated by skin abnormalities. A subset of ichthyosis vulgaris, an AGL (absent granular layer)-type, is known to lack the granular layer of epidermis, and keratinocytes from affected individuals have been found to express a reduced amount of profilaggrin mRNA and protein (18Sybert V.P. Dale B.A. Holbrook K.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1985; 84: 191-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 19Nirunsuksiri W. Presland R.B. Brumbaugh S.G. Dale B.A. Fleckman P. J. Biol.

Invest. Dermatol. 2000; 115: 1072-1081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) report that a spontaneous mouse mutant, flaky tail (ft/ft), showed skin abnormalities similar to human ichthyosis vulgaris AGL and completely lacked the mature filaggrin protein (20Presland R.B. Boggess D. Lewis S.P. Hull C. Fleckman P. Sundberg J.P. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2000; 115: 1072-1081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In the present study, we applied RNA differential display to the developing mouse skin in which the simple basal layer of epidermis at 13.5 days postcoitus (dpc)1stratifies progressively by the addition of more differentiated layers, resulting in a fully differentiated cornified epithelium at 16.5 dpc. Here we describe the identification and characterization of a novel profilaggrin-like protein that we term hornerin. Hornerin contains EF-hand domains at the N terminus. ICR mice (Nippon SLC, Hamamatsu, Japan) were used throughout the experiments. RNA differential display for isolating cDNA fragments was performed with an RNAmap kit (GenHunter Corp., Brookline, MA) using RNA samples from the dorsal epidermis of mouse embryos from 12.5 to 16.5 dpc, as reported previously (21Takaishi M. Takata Y. Kuroki T. Huh N. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 111: 128-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A hornerin cDNA fragment of ∼360 bp in size was isolated by a primer set of 5′-TTTTTTTTTTTTVA-3′ and 5′-GGTACTCCAC-3′. Because the size of hornerin cDNA was >10 kb, both cDNA library screening and RT-PCR were employed for determination of the complete cDNA sequence. cDNA libraries were prepared using λZAP II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) from mouse embryonic skin at 16.5 dpc after reverse transcription with either oligo-dT or random primers, and the libraries were screened using the hornerin fragment as a probe. Based on the sequence information of the clones, primers were designed for amplifying cDNA fragments by RT-PCR. Approximately 10-kb cDNA fragments were amplified using TAKARA LA Taq(TAKARA SHUZO, Shiga, Japan) and a primer set of 5′-TTGGCAAAGATTACTGCCAAGCTTCA-3′ and 5′-CTGGGAATATGCATCTGGAACAAT-3′ under the cycle conditions of 94 °C for 3 min, 30 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 8 min, and 72 °C for 10 min. The resulting fragments were inserted into the pCR-XL-TOPO vector using a TOPO-XL PCR cloning kit (Invitrogen). Serial deletion constructs were made using a deletion kit for kilo-sequencing (TAKARA SHUZO, Shiga, Japan) for determination of the sequence. DNA sequencing was performed using an automated sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A sequence homology search was made using the BLAST algorithm. Northern blot analysis was performed according to conventional conditions using RNA extracted by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method. The embryonic epidermis was separated from the dermis under a dissecting microscope after treatment with 10 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline. Fifteen μg of total RNA was electrophoresed, transferred onto Hybond-N membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and hybridized to probes labeled with [32P]dCTP using a Megaprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The probes for hornerin and profilaggrin were ∼500 bp, covering the respective repetitive part of the coding region. The membranes were finally washed twice with 0.2× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015m sodium citrate) and 0.1% SDS at 43 °C for 15 min. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as a control for the applied amount of RNA. The procedure of in situhybridization was described previously (21Takaishi M. Takata Y. Kuroki T. Huh N. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 111: 128-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The hornerin probe used was a ∼500-bp fragment of the 3′-untranslated region. The probe for profilaggrin was prepared by amplifying a fragment corresponding to the 3′-untranslated region by RT-PCR from the embryonic skin of ICR mice and subcloned into the pLITMUS 28 vector (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The antisense and sense RNA probes were synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) with digoxigenin labeling (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Skin tissues of embryos at 17.5 dpc and 3-day-old neonates were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, phosphate-buffered saline and embedded in paraffin for making sections. To prepare antiserum, cDNA fragments covering either the EF-hand region plus a part of spacer or a repeat A3 (see “Results”) were amplified by RT-PCR and subcloned into pGEX-6P-1 (glutathione S-transferase gene fusion vector; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After induction of expression with 1 mm isopropyl thiogalactopyranoside in BL21 cells, the proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Rabbits were immunized by injecting the proteins with adjuvant (TiterMax Gold, CytRx). The resulting antibodies were affinity-purified using a HitrapN-hydroxysuccinimide-activated column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) conjugated with the purified peptides whose glutathioneS-transferase moiety had been eliminated with PreScission protease (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protein extracts were prepared by homogenizing skin tissues of embryonic and neonatal mice in 0.1m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture diluted according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Sigma), 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), and 2 mm pepstatin A (Peptide Institute, Osaka, Japan). Trichloroacetic acid solution was added to the homogenates to make the final concentration 10% and kept on ice for 15 min. After centrifugation, the precipitates were dissolved in 9 murea, 2% Triton X-100, and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol. Lithium dodecyl sulfate was added to 2%, and the pH of the solution was adjusted to 7.0 with 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). To prepare protein extracts from cultured cells, 10% cold trichloroacetic acid was added to the monolayer culture pre-washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were collected with a scraper and centrifuged. The precipitates were processed as described above. Ten- or 20-μg equivalents of protein were applied onto a 5–20% gradient SDS/polyacrylamide gel (PAGEL, Atto, Tokyo, Japan), electrophoresed, and transferred onto PolyScreen transfer membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The membranes were treated with the antibodies against hornerin, and positive signals were visualized by ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Preimmune antisera and the antibodies absorbed with the recombinant proteins were used for negative controls. A polyclonal antibody against mouse filaggrin (anti-muFilg) was purchased from Berkeley Antibody Co. (Richmond, CA), and a monoclonal anti-keratin K14, clone LL002, was from NeoMarkers (Fremont, CA). Paraffin sections were prepared from skin tissues of 3-day-old ICR mice after fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, and they were treated with 1 μg/ml proteinase K at 37 °C for 15 min. After blocking with 1% goat serum, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.02% sodium azide in buffer, the antibodies against the recombinant hornerin proteins were applied. The signals were detected with Envision+ (DAKO) followed by staining using a diaminobenzidine reagent set (Kirkegaard Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). For immunofluorescent observation, Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) or Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) was used as the second antibody. After thorough washing, FITC-labeled anti-muFilg (Berkeley Antibody Co.) was applied for double staining. The tissue sections were observed by a confocal laser microscopy, LSM510 (Carl Zeiss). Embryonic mouse skin at 17.5 dpc was incubated in 0.03% collagenase A (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 4 °C for 24 h, and the epidermis was separated from the dermis. An epidermal cell suspension was inoculated into plastic dishes pre-coated with 5-fold-diluted Matrigel (Becton Dickinson) in MCDB 153 (IK) (Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka, Japan) supplemented with 5 μg/ml insulin, 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 14.1 μg/ml phosphoethanolamine, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (Sigma), 0.2∼0.4% EHS cell extract (Matrigel, Iwaki Glass, Chiba, Japan), and 50 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract (KYOKUTO, Tokyo, Japan). For the induction of differentiation, 0.12 mmCa2+ was added into the medium of semi-confluent cultures, and the cells were harvested 24 and 48 h after the addition. A hornerin cDNA fragment of 360 bp was originally isolated by RNA differential display applied to the developing mouse skin. The band first appeared at 15.5 dpc and increased toward 16.5 dpc (Fig. 1). The size of hornerin mRNA was estimated by Northern blot analysis to be >10 kb. The cDNA library screening resulted in the isolation of several clones that as composites covered ∼4.5 kb at the 5′ side and ∼2.5 kb at the 3′ side. The missing central part was obtained by RT-PCR. Altogether, we identified 10,622-bp cDNA followed by poly(A) tail. One open reading frame was found encoding a protein of 2,496 amino acids. The sequence was registered under the accession number AY027660. The deduced amino acid sequence comprises EF-hand domains at the N terminus followed by a spacer sequence and a large repetitive domain (Fig. 2 a). This structural composition of hornerin is shared by the fused gene-type precursor proteins of the cornified envelope. The repetitive segments composed of ∼170 amino acids were classified into 2 groups (A and B) depending on their amino acid sequences. As shown in Fig. 2 a, groups A and B comprised four different sequences. A representative sequence from each group, i.e. A3 and B1, is shown in Fig. 2 b. About 80% of the amino acids in A and B sequences are identical. Within each group, the sequences are well conserved,i.e. the difference in amino acids is less than 4 residues in ∼170 amino acids. The repetitive region of hornerin protein shows a theoretical pI of 11.02 and is rich in glycine (24%), serine (32%), and glutamine/glutamate (15%), characteristics similar to those of mouse and human filaggrin (22Steinert P.M. Cantieri J.S. Teller D.C. Lonsdale-Eccles J, D. Dale B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4097-4101Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 23McKinley-Grant L.J. Idler W.W.

No known proteins were found in a homology search with the repetitive segments of hornerin, but the EF-hand region exhibited substantial homology with that of human profilaggrin, human trichohyalin, mouse repetin, and S100 proteins (Fig. 3). In Northern analysis using the repetitive part of hornerin, the hornerin mRNA in the epidermis was first detected at 15.5 dpc and increased toward 16.5 dpc as expected from the results of RNA differential display (Fig. 4 a). Profilaggrin was expressed in the epidermis only at 16.5 dpc. Neither hornerin nor profilaggrin mRNA was detected in the dermis. In addition to embryonic mouse skin, hornerin mRNA was detected in the tongue, esophagus, forestomach, and skin among the adult tissues examined (Fig. 4 b). All of the tissues expressing hornerin are cornifying stratified squamous epithelium. The expression profile of hornerin is similar to that of profilaggrin. In in situ hybridization, hornerin transcripts were detected in the granular cornified layer of embryonic skin at 17.5 dpc (Fig. 5 b). No signal was observed when the sense probe of hornerin was used (Fig. 5 c). Profilaggrin was expressed in the same layers (Fig. 5 d).In situ hybridization performed on the sections from a 3-day-old neonatal mouse gave similar results (data not shown). The antibodies against the repeat A3 (anti-repA) and the EF-hand region (anti-EF) of hornerin specifically recognized the respective immunogens (Fig. 6 a). Using these antibodies, a band corresponding to the expected size of hornerin was detected by Western blotting (arrow in Fig. 6 b, lane 1 by anti-repA and lane 3 by anti-EF). Preimmune serum of the respective rabbits showed no bands (Fig. 6 b,lanes 2 and 4). This was also the case when the antibodies were absorbed with the respective immunogens in advance (data not shown). During the development of embryonic skin, the hornerin protein was first detected at 15.5 dpc, and the level increased progressively to newborn mice (Fig. 6 c, lanes 1–4). Profilaggrin appeared only at 16.5 dpc and was also induced during the process (Fig. 6 c, lanes 5–8). The preimmune sera and the absorbed antibodies described above showed negative results for embryonic skin extracts as well (data not shown). These expression profiles of hornerin indicate that hornerin may be involved in differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes. Western blotting using anti-muFilg showed a ladder of discrete bands (Fig. 6 b, lane 5), as expected from results presented in previous reports (24Kubilus J. Scott I. Harding C.R. Yendle J. Kvedar J. Baden H.P. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1985; 85: 513-517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 25Kuechle M.K. Presland R.B. Lewis S.P. Fleckman P. Dale B.A. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 566-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These bands are thought to be intermediary products of the profilaggrin processing. When the blot was exposed longer, a band corresponding to filaggrin became visible (Fig. 6 b, lane 6, arrowhead). Similarly, a number of discrete bands were detected by anti-repA and anti-EF (Fig. 6, b, lanes 1 and 3, andc, lanes 2–4) in addition to the band corresponding to the intact hornerin protein. The protein extracts were prepared under conditions to minimize nonspecific degradation (see “Experimental Procedures”). There was no sign of degradation of keratin K14 (Fig. 6 c, lanes 9–10). Taking into account the structural features of hornerin that are the same as those of profilaggrin, the present results indicate that the hornerin protein may be processed by specific endoproteases to repetitive units like profilaggrin during epidermal differentiation. Immunostaining with anti-repA showed the presence of the hornerin protein in the granular and cornified layers of the epidermis of a 3-day-old mouse (Fig. 7 b). A similar staining pattern was observed when the sections were stained with anti-EF (data not shown). The preimmune serum gave no signal (Fig. 7 c). Profilaggrin was also detected in the granular and cornified layers, as expected from results presented in previous reports (Fig. 7 d). To determine the intracellular localization of the two proteins, we doubly stained the tissue sections with fluorescent labeling. Hornerin (red, Fig. 8 a) and profilaggrin (green, Fig. 8b) proteins were observed as a granular distribution. When the two panels were merged, most of the dots wereyellow (Fig. 8, c and d), indicating that the hornerin protein is present in keratohyalin granules with profilaggrin. This was unlikely to have been because of nonspecific binding of FITC-labeled anti-muFilg to the pre-formed immune complex of the anti-hornerin antibody and the second antibody, because no overlapping signal was observed when the FITC-labeled anti-muFilg was replaced with FITC-labeled cytokeratin K14 (data not shown). Because the structural features and the expression profile of hornerin indicated its possible involvement in epidermal differentiation, we examined the expression of hornerin in differentiating epidermal keratinocytes in culture. A primary culture of epidermal keratinocytes from mouse embryos was induced to differentiate gradually by increasing the Ca2+concentration in the medium to 0.12 mm. The cells ceased to grow and become flattened. Some of the cells progressively accumulated granules in cytoplasm. Almost no hornerin or profilaggrin proteins were detected in the growing cells but were induced 48 h after the addition of Ca2+ (Fig. 9 a). The induced hornerin protein was shown to be associated with presumptive keratohyalin granules (Fig. 9 b). Systematic isolation of involved genes is a prerequisite for understanding molecular mechanisms of the growth/differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes. One of the possible approaches is based on differential expression of genes among distinct cell layers at different differentiation stages of the epidermis. However, separation of individual epidermal cell layers is almost impossible. The mouse epidermis at 13.5 dpc is composed of a single cell layer. In the subsequent development process, more differentiated cell layers,i.e. spinous, granular, and cornified layers, are consecutively added to the existing layer(s) (26Sengel P. Morphogenesis of Skin. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1976: 5-57Google Scholar). Our strategy is based on the notion that comparison of gene expression levels among epidermal tissues at different developmental stages may be equivalent to that among different layers of the mature epidermis. This approach has proved successful, resulting in identification of a number of genes involved in growth/differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes (21Takaishi M. Takata Y. Kuroki T. Huh N. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 111: 128-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 27Takaishi M. Huh N. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Genomics. 2001; 74: 172-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), including hornerin, described in this manuscript. Hornerin has common structural features with the fused gene-type cornified envelope-precursor proteins, i.e. the presence of EF-hand domains at the N terminus followed by repetitive segments (6Krieg P. Schuppler M. Koesters R. Mincheva A. Lichter P. Marks F. Genomics. 1997; 43: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 7Lee S.C. Kim I.G. Marekov L.N. O'Keefe E.J. Parry D.A. Steinert P.M.

Biol. 1993; 13: 613-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The N-terminal sequence of hornerin showed significant homology with those proteins (Fig. 3). The region containing two EF-hand domains is known to bind Ca2+. The structure is of significance because Ca2+ is known to trigger the process of cornification (29Hennings H. Michael D. Cheng C. Steinert P. Holbrook K. Yuspa S.H. Cell. 1980; 19: 245-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar). The repetitive region of hornerin is rich in serine (∼30%) and glycine (∼20%) as well as glutamine/glutamate (∼15%). The amino acid composition of hornerin is most similar to that of profilaggrin (22Steinert P.M. Cantieri J.S. Teller D.C. Lonsdale-Eccles J, D. Dale B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4097-4101Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 23McKinley-Grant L.J. Idler W.W. Bernstein I.A. Parry D.A. Cannizzaro L. Croce C.M. Huebner K. Lessin S.R. Steinert P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4848-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) among the proteins known to be involved in epidermal cornification. Hornerin protein contains a smaller amount of histidine than does profilaggrin. The abundance of serine and glycine may confer a flexible loop conformation upon the hornerin protein like loricrin (30Hohl D. Mehrel T. Lichti U. Turner M.L. Roop D.R. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6626-6636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The glutamine residues of hornerin may serve as acceptors of glutamyl-lysyl isopeptide bonds mediated by transglutaminase. It is also likely that the glutamine residues are eventually metabolized to pyrrolidone carboxylic acid, as in filaggrin, to increase the water content in the cornified layer (31Scott I.R. Harding C.R. Barrett J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 719: 110-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 32Scott I.R. Harding C.R. Dev. Biol. 1986; 115: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, Western blotting with anti-hornerin antibodies resulted in the identification of a number of discrete bands in the ladder. The homogenate buffer contained abundant protease inhibitors, and the procedure of extract preparation was carefully optimized. This resulted in the observation of clear discreet bands of the intermediates of the processing of profilaggrin (Fig. 6 c). There was no sign of degradation of keratin K14 in the extracts. These results argue for the possibility that hornerin is proteolytically processed during keratinocyte differentiation, as in the case of profilaggrin. This is consistent with the finding that the major part of hornerin protein is composed of homogeneous repetitive units like profilaggrin. The hornerin protein was identified in association with keratohyalin granules in which profilaggrin was also localized in the granular cells of the mouse epidermis (Fig. 8). Overall, hornerin is very similar to profilaggrin in its structural features, expression profiles, intracellular localization, proteolytic processing, and possible involvement in epidermal differentiation. Because cornification is crucial for normal epidermal function, impairment of this process results in a large variety of human diseases (33McGrath J.A. Eady R.A. Adv. Genet. 2001; 43: 1-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Loricrin keratoderma, formerly regarded as a type of Vohwinkel syndrome (34Maestrini E. Monaco A.P. McGrath J.A. Ishida-Yamamoto A. Camisa C.

As described in the Introduction, AGL-type ichthyosis vulgaris is known to lack the granular layer of epidermis, and keratinocytes from patients with this disorder expressed reduced amounts of profilaggrin mRNA and protein (18Sybert V.P. Dale B.A. Holbrook K.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1985; 84: 191-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 19Nirunsuksiri W. Presland R.B. Brumbaugh S.G. Dale B.A. Fleckman P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 871-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The close similarity of hornerin to profilaggrin indicates that hornerin may be associated with some hereditary ichthyotic disorders as well. In addition to the pleiotropic functions of profilaggrin in epidermal cornification, recent studies reveal even broader biological roles,e.g. sensitizing keratinocyte cell lines to apoptotic signals (25Kuechle M.K. Presland R.B. Lewis S.P. Fleckman P. Dale B.A. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 566-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and inducing an auto-antibody in rheumatoid arthritis patients (39Simon M. Girbal E. Sebbag M.

Further analysis of hornerin in comparison with profilaggrin will certainly reveal crucial molecular mechanisms underlying such important biological and clinical events.

https://openalex.org/W2080646585,"The phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 is thought to be required for biosynthesis of the cell's translational apparatus, a critical component of cell growth and proliferation. We have studied the signal transduction pathways involved in hepatic S6 phosphorylation during late gestation in the rat. This is a period during which hepatocytes show a high rate of proliferation that is, at least in part, independent of mitogenic signaling pathways that are operative in mature hepatocytes. Our initial studies demonstrated that there was low basal activity of two S6 kinases in liver, S6K1 and S6K2, on embryonic day 19 (2 days preterm). In addition, insulin- and growth factor-mediated S6K1 and S6K2 activation was markedly attenuated compared with that in adult liver. Nonetheless, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis demonstrated that fetal liver S6 itself was highly phosphorylated. To characterize the fetal hepatocyte pathway for S6 phosphorylation, we went on to study the sensitivity of hepatocyte proliferation to the S6 kinase inhibitor rapamycin. Unexpectedly, administration of rapamycin to embryonic day 19 fetuses in situ did not affect hepatocyte DNA synthesis. This resistance to the growth inhibitory effect of rapamycin occurred even though S6K1 and S6K2 were inhibited. Furthermore, fetal hepatocyte proliferation was sustained even though rapamycin administration resulted in the dephosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6. In contrast, rapamycin blocked hepatic DNA synthesis in adult rats following partial hepatectomy coincident with S6 dephosphorylation. We conclude that hepatocyte proliferation in the late gestation fetus is supported by a rapamycin-resistant mechanism that can function independently of ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation.

Cuezva J.M. Biol. Neonate. 1985; 48: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This rate of hepatic growth slows markedly at term; and although there is a restoration of vigorous growth in the neonatal period, the extraordinary rate of growth seen in late gestation is never again attained. We have shown previously that late fetal and neonatal development is associated with a distinctive pattern of hepatocyte proliferation during the perinatal period (2Curran T.R.J. Bahner R.I.J. Oh W. Gruppuso P.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 209: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 3Gruppuso P.A. Awad M. Bienieki T.C. Boylan J.M. Fernando S. Faris R.A. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1997; 33: 562-568Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Our work has focused on the developmentally regulated signal transduction mechanisms that control hepatocyte proliferation during late gestation and beyond.Activation of hepatocyte proliferation following partial hepatectomy in the adult rat has been shown to correlate with the intracellular activation of several interacting protein kinase cascades (Reviewed in Ref. 4Diehl A.M. Rai R.M. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). One of the signaling cascades that is activated after partial hepatectomy leads to the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 (5Nemenoff R.A. Price D.J. Mendelsohn M.J. Carter E.A. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19455-19460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is characterized by its sensitivity to the immunosuppressant rapamycin (6Brown E.J. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1996; 86: 517-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Studies have established that the target of rapamycin is mTOR (mammalian target ofrapamycin; also named FRAP/RAFT1) (7Brown E.J. Beal P.A. Keith C.T. Chen J. Shin T.B. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Rapamycin forms a complex with the immunophilin peptidylprolyl isomerase FKBP12, which binds to mTOR and inhibits its ability to phosphorylate substrates such as S6 kinase and 4E-BP1. Phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6, located in the 40 S subunit, is thought to be required for the translation of a subset of mRNAs that contain a 5′-oligopyrimidine tract at their transcriptional start sites (5′-terminal oligopyrimidine (5′-TOP)1 mRNAs) (8Dufner A. Thomas G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). 5′-TOP mRNAs may number as few as 100–200, but they can account for 20–30% of total cellular mRNA. They encode many of the components of the translational apparatus, including ribosomal proteins and elongation factors that are necessary for cell cycle progression. Recently, Volarevic et al. (9Volarevic S. Stewart M.J. Ledermann B. Zilberman F. Terracciano L. Montini E. Grompe M. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Science. 2000; 288: 2045-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) developed a system for the conditional deletion of protein S6 in mouse liver. They made the unexpected observation that loss of S6 had no effect on hepatocyte growth in response to refeeding after a fast, but that hepatocyte proliferation in response to partial hepatectomy was completely abolished. This led these authors to conclude that abrogation of 40 S ribosome biogenesis may induce checkpoint control that prevents cell cycle progression.Thomas and co-workers (10Jeno P. Ballou L.M. Novak-Hofer I. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 406-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) first purified and characterized the kinase activity responsible for S6 phosphorylation in mitogen-stimulated Swiss mouse 3T3 cells more than 10 years ago. Subsequent purification and cloning showed that two isoforms of this original kinase are produced from the same transcript (reviewed by Dufner and Thomas (8Dufner A. Thomas G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar)). Null mutation in mice for the p70/p85 S6 kinases, which we will refer to as S6K1, is associated with a proportional 20% decrease in somatic growth (11Shima H. Pende M. Chen Y. Fumagalli S. Thomas G. Kozma S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6649-6659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from these animals showed diminished (but not absent) S6 phosphorylation, leading to the discovery of another physiological S6 kinase. This enzyme, a mitogen-responsive S6K1 homolog designated S6K2, has since been identified by other laboratories (12Gout I. Minami T. Hara K. Tsujishita Y. Filonenko V. Waterfield M.D. Yonezawa K. J.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5108-5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It has recently been determined that S6K1 and S6K2 are regulated similarly by effectors of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, including Cdc42, Rac, protein kinase Cζ, and phospholipid-dependent kinase-1 (14Martin K.A.

Cell Growth Differ. 2000; 11: 325-334PubMed Google Scholar). Given the established role of S6 phosphorylation in hepatocyte proliferation, we undertook a study of the hepatic signal transduction pathways terminating in ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation in fetal and adult rats.DISCUSSIONFor a cell to proliferate, it must up-regulate the biosynthetic apparatus needed to support cell growth. Studies have shown that the mRNA transcripts for all ribosomal proteins and protein synthesis elongation factors contain an unusual oligopyrimidine tract at their transcriptional start sites, commonly referred to as a 5′-TOP. The translation of these mRNAs has been shown to be dependent on S6K1 activation, presumably mediated by an increase in S6 phosphorylation (28Jefferies H.B. Reinhard C. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4441-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Studies have demonstrated that 5′-TOP mRNA translation is selectively inhibited by the immunosuppressant rapamycin, a potent inhibitor of S6 kinase activity (29Jefferies H.B.J. Fumagalli S. Dennis P.B. Reinhard C. Pearson R.B. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3693-3704Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar).Our initial studies led to the unexpected finding that basal hepatic S6K1 activity in the late gestation fetal rat is lower than in adult animals. Given our prior observations demonstrating that late gestation fetal rat hepatocytes proliferate at a high rate both in vivo and in vitro (2Curran T.R.J. Bahner R.I.J. Oh W. Gruppuso P.A. Exp.

Biol. 1997; 33: 562-568Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the low basal S6K1 activity represents a dissociation between cell proliferation and activity of this key signaling enzyme (3Gruppuso P.A. Awad M. Bienieki T.C. Boylan J.M. Fernando S. Faris R.A. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1997; 33: 562-568Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Furthermore, S6K1 activation in response to the in vivo administration of insulin or EGF was markedly attenuated in fetal liver compared with adult liver. This is reminiscent of our observations showing similar uncoupling of the ERK MAPK pathway in late gestation liver (16Boylan J.M. Gruppuso P.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1261-1269PubMed Google Scholar, 17Boylan J.M. Gruppuso P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3784-3790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We proceeded to demonstrate that, despite the low basal activity of S6K1, ribosomal protein S6 is indeed hyperphosphorylated in fetal liver. We considered S6K2 to be a candidate to account for the phosphorylation of S6 in fetal liver. Basal S6K2 activity was ∼2-fold higher in E19 liver than in adult liver, consistent with a role for S6K2 in maintaining S6 phosphorylation in vivo. However, the relatively low S6K2specific activity that we measured is entirely consistent with the possibility of an alternative mechanism for S6 hyperphosphorylation in fetal liver. One such explanation would be the existence of an alternative S6 kinase. Another possibility is a lower level of S6 phosphatase activity in fetal liver ribosomes. Studies by Olivieret al. (22Olivier A.R. Ballou L.M. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4720-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) indicate that the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase-1 mediates the dephosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6. Low protein phosphatase-1 expression, decreased localization to ribosomes through decreased expression of associated subunits, or inhibition of ribosomal protein phosphatase-1 activity could serve to maintain S6 in a hyperphosphorylated state, even in the absence of excess kinase activity in fetal liver.To dissect the pathways accounting for the fetal liver S6 hyperphosphorylation, we administered rapamycin to intact animals. These studies were undertaken to test the hypothesis that fetal hepatocytes utilize an alternative, rapamycin-resistant pathway for S6 phosphorylation. Indeed, we found that rapamycin administration to E19 rats in situ did not inhibit DNA synthesis despite potent inhibition of S6K1 and S6K2. This led to analysis for the sensitivity of S6 phosphorylation to rapamycin and the unexpected finding that fetal hepatocyte proliferation in vivo could proceed following rapamycin administration even though S6 phosphorylation was markedly decreased. These results contrasted with those in adult animals. We employed a commonly used method for inducing adult hepatocytes to enter the cell cycle, a two-thirds hepatectomy (30Fausto N. Webber E.M. Arias A.M.B.J. Fausto N. Jacoby W.B. Schlacter D. Shafrits D.A. The Liver: Biology and Pathobiology. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 1059-1084Google Scholar). This resulted in an increase in S6K1 activity as well as a marked increase in S6 phosphorylation. As anticipated, rapamycin effectively blocked in vivo S6 phosphorylation and hepatocyte DNA synthesis following partial hepatectomy. These results are consistent with the recently published report by Jiang et al. (25Jiang Y.-P. Ballou L.M. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10943-10951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) showing that rapamycin blocks activation of p70S6K in a dose-dependent manner and inhibits recovery of liver mass after a partial hepatectomy.There are precedents for the dissociation of S6 phosphorylation and cell proliferation. Kawasome et al. (31Kawasome H. Papst P. Webb S. Keller G.M. Johnson G.L. Gelfand E.W. Terada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5033-5038Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) performed studies that point to the existence of S6-independent mechanisms for 5′-TOP mRNA translation. Their S6K1 knockout murine embryonic stem cells did not show any S6 phosphorylation in vivo. However, 40% of total cellular eukaryotic elongation factor-1α mRNA, a 5′-TOP mRNA, was detected in polysomal fractions, indicating active eukaryotic elongation factor-1α translation. Prior to these studies, S6K1 activation was generally thought to be essential for G1/S transition. This was based on the work of Laneet al. (32Lane H.A. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Thomas G. Nature. 1993; 363: 170-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), who showed that microinjection of antibodies against S6K1 prevented the entry of cells into the cell cycle. Kawasomeet al. (31Kawasome H. Papst P. Webb S. Keller G.M. Johnson G.L. Gelfand E.W. Terada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5033-5038Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) found that the S6K1 null embryonic stem cells proliferated well, albeit slower than parental cells, indicating that S6K1 is not essential for G1/S transition. Interestingly, rapamycin inhibited the proliferation of the S6K1 null cells to the same extent as the parental cells, indicating that events independent of S6K1 activation, but probably requiring mTOR activation, are critical for cell proliferation.This uncoupling of S6K1 activity and proliferation had previously been shown in activated T cells that were already cycling (33Terada N. Franklin R.A. Lucas J.J. Blenis J. Gelfand E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12062-12068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in erythroleukemic cell lines (34Calvo V. Wood M. Gjertson C. Vik T. Bierer B.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 2664-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Slavik et al. (35Slavik J.M. Lim D.-G. Burakoff S.J. Hafler D.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3201-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) recently found that p70S6K activation can be uncoupled from proliferation in both freshly isolated CD8+ T cells and CD8+ T cell clones, demonstrating for the first time rapamycin resistance in resting, nontransformed T cells.In studies by Withers et al. (36Withers D.J. Seufferlein T. Mann D. Garcia B. Jones N. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) employing Swiss 3T3 cells, p70S6K activation was dissociated from DNA synthesis. Although rapamycin could inhibit both bombesin-mediated p70S6K activation and [3H]thymidine incorporation, the combination of bombesin plus insulin was able to stimulate DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression in the presence of rapamycin despite inhibition of p70S6K activity. These results were interpreted as indicating the presence of a rapamycin-insensitive mitogenic pathway in Swiss 3T3 cells.Another conclusion from our studies is that the signaling phenotype of fetal hepatocytes is altered when the cells are removed from theirin vivo milieu. In vivo, E19 hepatocytes showed a resistance to the S6K-activating effects of insulin and EGF and to the inhibitory effect of rapamycin on DNA synthesis. In contrast, primary cultures of E19 hepatocytes showed an intact response to hormonal activation of S6K1 and S6K2 as well as heightened sensitivity to the growth inhibitory effects of rapamycin. A similar in vivo toin vitro change in mitogenic signaling was seen in our studies on the developmental regulation of hepatic ERK1 and ERK2 (17Boylan J.M. Gruppuso P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3784-3790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We have not established a mechanism for the uncoupling of proximal signaling from S6 kinase activation in developing liver. However, recent studies indicate a similar uncoupling of Akt activation and low levels of key proximal signaling molecules, including insulin receptor substrate-1 and Gab2. 2J. M. Boylan and P. A. Gruppuso, unpublished observations.As was the case for signaling to S6 kinases, fetal hepatocyte rapamycin resistance as measured by DNA synthesis was lost when hepatocytes were isolated and cultured. We observed an IC50 for both fetal and adult cells that was near 20 nm. The dose of rapamycin that we chose for our in vivo experiments was designed to achieve micromolar concentrations. Studies on “rapamycin-resistant” cancer cell lines have shown an IC50 in the micromolar range (37Hosoi H. Dilling M.B. Liu L.N. Danks J.K. Shikata T. Sekulic A. Abraham R.T. Lawrence J.C. Houghton P.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 815-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar).In summary, our results point to an alternative, S6 phosphorylation-independent pathway that supports fetal hepatocyte proliferation during late gestation. Our data indicate that phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 is not necessary for fetal hepatocyte proliferation in vivo. Given that translation of 5′-TOP mRNAs is thought to be essential for cellular proliferation, we conclude that fetal hepatocytes possess an alternative pathway for up-regulation of the translation of these genes. We found no evidence that this pathway is operative in adult hepatocytes. This conclusion is consistent with our previous studies (15Leeds P. Kren B.T. Boylan J.M. Betz N.A. Steer C.J. Gruppuso P.A. Ross J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1279-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 16Boylan J.M. Gruppuso P.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1261-1269PubMed Google Scholar, 17Boylan J.M. Gruppuso P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3784-3790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) in that it suggests that mechanisms that mediate the proliferation of late gestation fetal hepatocytes are distinct from those that mediate the proliferation of mature hepatocytes in vivo. Finally, the rapamycin resistance displayed by a spectrum of cancer cells (37Hosoi H. Dilling M.B. Liu L.N. Danks J.K. Shikata T. Sekulic A. Abraham R.T. Lawrence J.C. Houghton P.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 815-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) suggests that the mechanism for phospho-S6-independent hepatocyte proliferation in the late gestation fetal rat may prove relevant to liver carcinogenesis. During the last 3 days of gestation in the rat, fetal weight more than triples, with liver weight increasing proportionately (1Mayor F. Cuezva J.M. Biol. Neonate. 1985; 48: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This rate of hepatic growth slows markedly at term; and although there is a restoration of vigorous growth in the neonatal period, the extraordinary rate of growth seen in late gestation is never again attained. We have shown previously that late fetal and neonatal development is associated with a distinctive pattern of hepatocyte proliferation during the perinatal period (2Curran T.R.J. Bahner R.I.J. Oh W. Gruppuso P.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 209: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 3Gruppuso P.A. Awad M. Bienieki T.C. Boylan J.M. Fernando S. Faris R.A. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1997; 33: 562-568Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Our work has focused on the developmentally regulated signal transduction mechanisms that control hepatocyte proliferation during late gestation and beyond. Activation of hepatocyte proliferation following partial hepatectomy in the adult rat has been shown to correlate with the intracellular activation of several interacting protein kinase cascades (Reviewed in Ref. 4Diehl A.M. Rai R.M. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). One of the signaling cascades that is activated after partial hepatectomy leads to the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 (5Nemenoff R.A. Price D.J. Mendelsohn M.J. Carter E.A. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19455-19460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is characterized by its sensitivity to the immunosuppressant rapamycin (6Brown E.J. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1996; 86: 517-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Studies have established that the target of rapamycin is mTOR (mammalian target ofrapamycin; also named FRAP/RAFT1) (7Brown E.J. Beal P.A. Keith C.T. Chen J. Shin T.B. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Rapamycin forms a complex with the immunophilin peptidylprolyl isomerase FKBP12, which binds to mTOR and inhibits its ability to phosphorylate substrates such as S6 kinase and 4E-BP1. Phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6, located in the 40 S subunit, is thought to be required for the translation of a subset of mRNAs that contain a 5′-oligopyrimidine tract at their transcriptional start sites (5′-terminal oligopyrimidine (5′-TOP)1 mRNAs) (8Dufner A. Thomas G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). 5′-TOP mRNAs may number as few as 100–200, but they can account for 20–30% of total cellular mRNA. They encode many of the components of the translational apparatus, including ribosomal proteins and elongation factors that are necessary for cell cycle progression. Recently, Volarevic et al. (9Volarevic S. Stewart M.J. Ledermann B. Zilberman F. Terracciano L. Montini E. Grompe M. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Science. 2000; 288: 2045-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) developed a system for the conditional deletion of protein S6 in mouse liver. They made the unexpected observation that loss of S6 had no effect on hepatocyte growth in response to refeeding after a fast, but that hepatocyte proliferation in response to partial hepatectomy was completely abolished. This led these authors to conclude that abrogation of 40 S ribosome biogenesis may induce checkpoint control that prevents cell cycle progression. Thomas and co-workers (10Jeno P. Ballou L.M. Novak-Hofer I. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 406-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) first purified and characterized the kinase activity responsible for S6 phosphorylation in mitogen-stimulated Swiss mouse 3T3 cells more than 10 years ago. Subsequent purification and cloning showed that two isoforms of this original kinase are produced from the same transcript (reviewed by Dufner and Thomas (8Dufner A. Thomas G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar)). Null mutation in mice for the p70/p85 S6 kinases, which we will refer to as S6K1, is associated with a proportional 20% decrease in somatic growth (11Shima H. Pende M. Chen Y. Fumagalli S. Thomas G. Kozma S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6649-6659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from these animals showed diminished (but not absent) S6 phosphorylation, leading to the discovery of another physiological S6 kinase. This enzyme, a mitogen-responsive S6K1 homolog designated S6K2, has since been identified by other laboratories (12Gout I. Minami T. Hara K. Tsujishita Y. Filonenko V. Waterfield M.D. Yonezawa K. J.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5108-5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It has recently been determined that S6K1 and S6K2 are regulated similarly by effectors of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, including Cdc42, Rac, protein kinase Cζ, and phospholipid-dependent kinase-1 (14Martin K.A. Schalm S.S. Richardson C. Romanelli A. Keon K.L. Blenis J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7884-7891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Our prior studies on mitogenic signaling during liver development in the rat have suggested that the well characterized pathways that mediate growth factor-induced mitogenesis in adult rat hepatocytes are not operative in the late gestation fetus. Our results have indicated an alternative means for the up-regulation of c-myc via RNA stabilization (15Leeds P. Kren B.T. Boylan J.M. Betz N.A. Steer C.J. Gruppuso P.A. Ross J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1279-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), uncoupling of the prototypical MAPK pathway that terminates in ERK1/2 (16Boylan J.M. Gruppuso P.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1261-1269PubMed Google Scholar, 17Boylan J.M. Gruppuso P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3784-3790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and post-transcriptional induction of cyclin D1 (18Awad M.M. Gruppuso P.A. Cell Growth Differ. 2000; 11: 325-334PubMed Google Scholar). Given the established role of S6 phosphorylation in hepatocyte proliferation, we undertook a study of the hepatic signal transduction pathways terminating in ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation in fetal and adult rats. DISCUSSIONFor a cell to proliferate, it must up-regulate the biosynthetic apparatus needed to support cell growth. Studies have shown that the mRNA transcripts for all ribosomal proteins and protein synthesis elongation factors contain an unusual oligopyrimidine tract at their transcriptional start sites, commonly referred to as a 5′-TOP. The translation of these mRNAs has been shown to be dependent on S6K1 activation, presumably mediated by an increase in S6 phosphorylation (28Jefferies H.B. Reinhard C. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4441-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Studies have demonstrated that 5′-TOP mRNA translation is selectively inhibited by the immunosuppressant rapamycin, a potent inhibitor of S6 kinase activity (29Jefferies H.B.J. Fumagalli S. Dennis P.B. Reinhard C. Pearson R.B. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3693-3704Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar).Our initial studies led to the unexpected finding that basal hepatic S6K1 activity in the late gestation fetal rat is lower than in adult animals. Given our prior observations demonstrating that late gestation fetal rat hepatocytes proliferate at a high rate both in vivo and in vitro (2Curran T.R.J. Bahner R.I.J. Oh W. Gruppuso P.A. Exp.

Biol. 1997; 33: 562-568Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the low basal S6K1 activity represents a dissociation between cell proliferation and activity of this key signaling enzyme (3Gruppuso P.A. Awad M. Bienieki T.C. Boylan J.M. Fernando S. Faris R.A. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1997; 33: 562-568Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Furthermore, S6K1 activation in response to the in vivo administration of insulin or EGF was markedly attenuated in fetal liver compared with adult liver. This is reminiscent of our observations showing similar uncoupling of the ERK MAPK pathway in late gestation liver (16Boylan J.M. Gruppuso P.A.

We proceeded to demonstrate that, despite the low basal activity of S6K1, ribosomal protein S6 is indeed hyperphosphorylated in fetal liver. We considered S6K2 to be a candidate to account for the phosphorylation of S6 in fetal liver. Basal S6K2 activity was ∼2-fold higher in E19 liver than in adult liver, consistent with a role for S6K2 in maintaining S6 phosphorylation in vivo.

Low protein phosphatase-1 expression, decreased localization to ribosomes through decreased expression of associated subunits, or inhibition of ribosomal protein phosphatase-1 activity could serve to maintain S6 in a hyperphosphorylated state, even in the absence of excess kinase activity in fetal liver.To dissect the pathways accounting for the fetal liver S6 hyperphosphorylation, we administered rapamycin to intact animals.

A similar in vivo toin vitro change in mitogenic signaling was seen in our studies on the developmental regulation of hepatic ERK1 and ERK2 (17Boylan J.M. Gruppuso P.A. J. Biol.

Finally, the rapamycin resistance displayed by a spectrum of cancer cells (37Hosoi H. Dilling M.B. Liu L.N. Danks J.K. Shikata T. Sekulic A. Abraham R.T. Lawrence J.C. Houghton P.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 815-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) suggests that the mechanism for phospho-S6-independent hepatocyte proliferation in the late gestation fetal rat may prove relevant to liver carcinogenesis. For a cell to proliferate, it must up-regulate the biosynthetic apparatus needed to support cell growth. Studies have shown that the mRNA transcripts for all ribosomal proteins and protein synthesis elongation factors contain an unusual oligopyrimidine tract at their transcriptional start sites, commonly referred to as a 5′-TOP. The translation of these mRNAs has been shown to be dependent on S6K1 activation, presumably mediated by an increase in S6 phosphorylation (28Jefferies H.B. Reinhard C. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4441-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Studies have demonstrated that 5′-TOP mRNA translation is selectively inhibited by the immunosuppressant rapamycin, a potent inhibitor of S6 kinase activity (29Jefferies H.B.J. Fumagalli S. Dennis P.B. Reinhard C. Pearson R.B. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3693-3704Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Our initial studies led to the unexpected finding that basal hepatic S6K1 activity in the late gestation fetal rat is lower than in adult animals. Given our prior observations demonstrating that late gestation fetal rat hepatocytes proliferate at a high rate both in vivo and in vitro (2Curran T.R.J. Bahner R.I.J. Oh W. Gruppuso P.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 209: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 3Gruppuso P.A. Awad M. Bienieki T.C. Boylan J.M. Fernando S. Faris R.A. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1997; 33: 562-568Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the low basal S6K1 activity represents a dissociation between cell proliferation and activity of this key signaling enzyme (3Gruppuso P.A. Awad M. Bienieki T.C. Boylan J.M. Fernando S. Faris R.A. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1997; 33: 562-568Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Furthermore, S6K1 activation in response to the in vivo administration of insulin or EGF was markedly attenuated in fetal liver compared with adult liver. This is reminiscent of our observations showing similar uncoupling of the ERK MAPK pathway in late gestation liver (16Boylan J.M. Gruppuso P.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1261-1269PubMed Google Scholar, 17Boylan J.M. Gruppuso P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3784-3790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We proceeded to demonstrate that, despite the low basal activity of S6K1, ribosomal protein S6 is indeed hyperphosphorylated in fetal liver. We considered S6K2 to be a candidate to account for the phosphorylation of S6 in fetal liver. Basal S6K2 activity was ∼2-fold higher in E19 liver than in adult liver, consistent with a role for S6K2 in maintaining S6 phosphorylation in vivo. However, the relatively low S6K2specific activity that we measured is entirely consistent with the possibility of an alternative mechanism for S6 hyperphosphorylation in fetal liver. One such explanation would be the existence of an alternative S6 kinase. Another possibility is a lower level of S6 phosphatase activity in fetal liver ribosomes. Studies by Olivieret al. (22Olivier A.R. Ballou L.M. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4720-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) indicate that the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase-1 mediates the dephosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6. Low protein phosphatase-1 expression, decreased localization to ribosomes through decreased expression of associated subunits, or inhibition of ribosomal protein phosphatase-1 activity could serve to maintain S6 in a hyperphosphorylated state, even in the absence of excess kinase activity in fetal liver. To dissect the pathways accounting for the fetal liver S6 hyperphosphorylation, we administered rapamycin to intact animals. These studies were undertaken to test the hypothesis that fetal hepatocytes utilize an alternative, rapamycin-resistant pathway for S6 phosphorylation. Indeed, we found that rapamycin administration to E19 rats in situ did not inhibit DNA synthesis despite potent inhibition of S6K1 and S6K2. This led to analysis for the sensitivity of S6 phosphorylation to rapamycin and the unexpected finding that fetal hepatocyte proliferation in vivo could proceed following rapamycin administration even though S6 phosphorylation was markedly decreased. These results contrasted with those in adult animals. We employed a commonly used method for inducing adult hepatocytes to enter the cell cycle, a two-thirds hepatectomy (30Fausto N. Webber E.M. Arias A.M.B.J. Fausto N. Jacoby W.B. Schlacter D. Shafrits D.A. The Liver: Biology and Pathobiology. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 1059-1084Google Scholar). This resulted in an increase in S6K1 activity as well as a marked increase in S6 phosphorylation. As anticipated, rapamycin effectively blocked in vivo S6 phosphorylation and hepatocyte DNA synthesis following partial hepatectomy. These results are consistent with the recently published report by Jiang et al. (25Jiang Y.-P. Ballou L.M. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10943-10951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) showing that rapamycin blocks activation of p70S6K in a dose-dependent manner and inhibits recovery of liver mass after a partial hepatectomy. There are precedents for the dissociation of S6 phosphorylation and cell proliferation. Kawasome et al. (31Kawasome H. Papst P. Webb S. Keller G.M. Johnson G.L. Gelfand E.W. Terada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5033-5038Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) performed studies that point to the existence of S6-independent mechanisms for 5′-TOP mRNA translation. Their S6K1 knockout murine embryonic stem cells did not show any S6 phosphorylation in vivo. However, 40% of total cellular eukaryotic elongation factor-1α mRNA, a 5′-TOP mRNA, was detected in polysomal fractions, indicating active eukaryotic elongation factor-1α translation. Prior to these studies, S6K1 activation was generally thought to be essential for G1/S transition. This was based on the work of Laneet al. (32Lane H.A. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Thomas G. Nature. 1993; 363: 170-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), who showed that microinjection of antibodies against S6K1 prevented the entry of cells into the cell cycle. Kawasomeet al. (31Kawasome H. Papst P. Webb S. Keller G.M. Johnson G.L. Gelfand E.W. Terada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5033-5038Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) found that the S6K1 null embryonic stem cells proliferated well, albeit slower than parental cells, indicating that S6K1 is not essential for G1/S transition. Interestingly, rapamycin inhibited the proliferation of the S6K1 null cells to the same extent as the parental cells, indicating that events independent of S6K1 activation, but probably requiring mTOR activation, are critical for cell proliferation. This uncoupling of S6K1 activity and proliferation had previously been shown in activated T cells that were already cycling (33Terada N. Franklin R.A. Lucas J.J. Blenis J. Gelfand E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12062-12068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in erythroleukemic cell lines (34Calvo V. Wood M. Gjertson C. Vik T. Bierer B.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 2664-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Slavik et al. (35Slavik J.M. Lim D.-G. Burakoff S.J. Hafler D.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3201-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) recently found that p70S6K activation can be uncoupled from proliferation in both freshly isolated CD8+ T cells and CD8+ T cell clones, demonstrating for the first time rapamycin resistance in resting, nontransformed T cells. In studies by Withers et al. (36Withers D.J. Seufferlein T. Mann D. Garcia B. Jones N. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) employing Swiss 3T3 cells, p70S6K activation was dissociated from DNA synthesis. Although rapamycin could inhibit both bombesin-mediated p70S6K activation and [3H]thymidine incorporation, the combination of bombesin plus insulin was able to stimulate DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression in the presence of rapamycin despite inhibition of p70S6K activity. These results were interpreted as indicating the presence of a rapamycin-insensitive mitogenic pathway in Swiss 3T3 cells. Another conclusion from our studies is that the signaling phenotype of fetal hepatocytes is altered when the cells are removed from theirin vivo milieu. In vivo, E19 hepatocytes showed a resistance to the S6K-activating effects of insulin and EGF and to the inhibitory effect of rapamycin on DNA synthesis. In contrast, primary cultures of E19 hepatocytes showed an intact response to hormonal activation of S6K1 and S6K2 as well as heightened sensitivity to the growth inhibitory effects of rapamycin. A similar in vivo toin vitro change in mitogenic signaling was seen in our studies on the developmental regulation of hepatic ERK1 and ERK2 (17Boylan J.M. Gruppuso P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3784-3790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We have not established a mechanism for the uncoupling of proximal signaling from S6 kinase activation in developing liver. However, recent studies indicate a similar uncoupling of Akt activation and low levels of key proximal signaling molecules, including insulin receptor substrate-1 and Gab2. 2J. M. Boylan and P. A. Gruppuso, unpublished observations. As was the case for signaling to S6 kinases, fetal hepatocyte rapamycin resistance as measured by DNA synthesis was lost when hepatocytes were isolated and cultured. We observed an IC50 for both fetal and adult cells that was near 20 nm. The dose of rapamycin that we chose for our in vivo experiments was designed to achieve micromolar concentrations. Studies on “rapamycin-resistant” cancer cell lines have shown an IC50 in the micromolar range (37Hosoi H. Dilling M.B. Liu L.N. Danks J.K. Shikata T. Sekulic A. Abraham R.T. Lawrence J.C. Houghton P.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 815-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In summary, our results point to an alternative, S6 phosphorylation-independent pathway that supports fetal hepatocyte proliferation during late gestation. Our data indicate that phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 is not necessary for fetal hepatocyte proliferation in vivo. Given that translation of 5′-TOP mRNAs is thought to be essential for cellular proliferation, we conclude that fetal hepatocytes possess an alternative pathway for up-regulation of the translation of these genes. We found no evidence that this pathway is operative in adult hepatocytes. This conclusion is consistent with our previous studies (15Leeds P. Kren B.T. Boylan J.M. Betz N.A. Steer C.J. Gruppuso P.A.

Finally, the rapamycin resistance displayed by a spectrum of cancer cells (37Hosoi H. Dilling M.B. Liu L.N. Danks J.K. Shikata T. Sekulic A. Abraham R.T. Lawrence J.C. Houghton P.J. Mol.

We greatly appreciate the assistance of Theresa Bienieki and Yang-Si Ou in the performance of these studies. We also thank Thomas Radimerski for helpful advice on the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of ribosomal proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2084499599,"MDM2 can bind the N terminus of p53 and promote its ubiquitination and export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where p53 can then be degraded by cytoplasmic proteasomes. Several studies have reported that an intact MDM2 binding domain is necessary for p53 to be targeted for ubiquitination, nuclear export, and degradation by MDM2. In the current study, we examined whether the MDM2 binding domain of p53 could be provided in transthrough oligomerization between two p53 molecules. p53 proteins mutated in their MDM2 binding domains were unable to bind MDM2 directly and were resistant to MDM2-mediated ubiquitination, nuclear export, and degradation when expressed with MDM2 alone. However, these same p53 mutants formed a complex with MDM2 and were efficiently ubiquitinated, exported from the nucleus, and degraded when co-expressed with MDM2 and wild-type p53. Moreover, this effect required MDM2 binding by wild-type p53 as well as oligomerization between wild-type p53 and the MDM2 binding-deficient p53 mutants. Taken together, these results support a model whereby MDM2 binding-deficient forms of p53 can bind MDM2 indirectly through oligomerization with wild-type p53 and are subsequently targeted for ubiquitination, nuclear export, and degradation. These findings may have important implications regarding the DNA damage response of p53.

These findings may have important implications regarding the DNA damage response of p53. murine double minute nuclear export signal hemagglutinin green fluorescent protein oligomerization domain The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a transcription factor and potent inhibitor of cell growth. Wild-type p53 is expressed at low levels in most cells because of a short protein half-life (1Maki C.G. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 2Maltzman W. Czyzyk L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1689-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). In contrast, the p53 protein is stabilized, and its levels increase in response to various stresses, including DNA damage, hypoxia, and inappropriate oncogene signaling (3Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). In its active form, p53 is a tetramer that can bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner and activate gene transcription (4Prives C. Hall P.A. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar). Several genes have been identified which are transcriptionally induced by p53, including p21 andbax (5el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7869) Google Scholar, 6Han J. Sabbatini P. Perez D. Rao L. Modha D. White E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 461-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Induction of these p53-responsive genes results in either a G1 cell cycle arrest or activation of an apoptotic cell death program, respectively (4Prives C. Hall P.A. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar). p53 levels are regulated in large part by MDM2,1 the product of a p53-inducible gene. MDM2 can bind the N terminus of p53 and inhibit the activity of p53 as a transcription factor (7Momand J. Zambetti G.P. Olson D.C. George D. Levine A.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1237-1245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2760) Google Scholar, 8Oliner J.D. Kinzler K.W. Meltzer P.S. George D.L. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1992; 358: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). Importantly, MDM2 binding also promotes the ubiquitination of p53 and its export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where p53 is then degraded by cytoplasmic proteasomes (9Fuchs S.Y. Adler V. Buschmann T. Wu X. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2543-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 10Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3629) Google Scholar, 11Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2798) Google Scholar). There is some evidence that MDM2 can function as a ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase, which can transfer ubiquitin directly to p53 (12Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). More recent studies have suggested a link between the ubiquitination of p53 and its export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In these studies, mutations that inhibited the ability of MDM2 to ubiquitinate p53 also inhibited p53 nuclear export (13Geyer R.K. Yu Z.K. Maki C.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 14Boyd S.D. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). These findings led to a model in which MDM2-mediated ubiquitination activates a nuclear export signal (NES) in p53, leading to p53 nuclear export. The stabilization of p53 that occurs in response to oncogene signaling is thought to result from increased levels of p14ARF , a tumor suppressor protein that can form a complex with MDM2 and inhibit the ability of MDM2 to degrade p53 (15Lowe S.W. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 1999; 6: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 16Honda R. Yasuda H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 17Lin A.W. Lowe S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5025-5030Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In contrast, the mechanisms by which p53 is stabilized in response to different DNA-damaging agents have not been fully clarified. Certain DNA-damaging agents, including UV radiation, actinomycin D, and the alkylating agents mitomycin C and methylmethane sulfonate, signal a decrease in MDM2 mRNA and protein levels and a subsequent decrease in p53 ubiquitination (18Inoue T. Geyer R.K. Yu Z.K. Maki C.G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 196-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 19Blattner C. Sparks A. Lane D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3704-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). This suggests that the stabilization of p53 in response to these agents results from a specific decrease in MDM2 gene expression. The most widely held view suggests that the DNA damage-induced stabilization of p53 results from phosphorylation of specific N-terminal sites in the p53 protein (3Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). For example, p53 is phosphorylated at multiple sites within or near the MDM2 binding domain in response to various DNA-damaging stresses (3Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar, 20Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Stavridi E.S. Halazonetis T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13777-13782Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at serines 15 and 20 has been reported to inhibit the interaction between p53 and MDM2 (20Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Stavridi E.S. Halazonetis T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13777-13782Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 21Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar). These results support a model in which DNA damage-induced phosphorylation at serines 15 and 20 stabilizes p53 by inhibiting p53-MDM2 binding and thus preventing MDM2 from promoting p53 ubiquitination. The premise of this model is that modifications to p53 that inhibit its direct interaction with MDM2 will stabilize the p53 protein. The purpose of the current study was to test the notion that direct binding between p53 and MDM2 is required for MDM2 to promote the ubiquitination, nuclear export, and degradation of p53. Toward this end, epitope-tagged p53 mutants were generated, which are deficient in their ability to bind MDM2. These mutants were resistant to MDM2-mediated ubiquitination, nuclear export, and degradation when expressed with MDM2 alone. However, these same p53 mutants formed a complex with MDM2 and were efficiently ubiquitinated, exported from the nucleus, and degraded when co-expressed with MDM2 and wild-type p53. Furthermore, this effect required MDM2 binding by the wild-type p53 protein as well as oligomerization between wild-type p53 and the MDM2 binding-deficient p53 mutants. Taken together, these results support a model whereby MDM2 binding-deficient forms of p53 can bind MDM2 indirectly through oligomerization with wild-type p53 and are subsequently targeted for ubiquitination, nuclear export, and degradation. These findings may have important implications regarding the DNA damage response of p53. Hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged wild-type p53 expression DNA was obtained from Christine Jost (Dana Farber Cancer Institute). Untagged wild-type p53 and untagged p53 Δ1–42 (22Unger T. Mietz J.A. Scheffner M. Yee C.L. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5186-5194Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) were from Peter Howley (Harvard Medical School). Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged wild-type p53 has been described (14Boyd S.D. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) and was obtained from Tyler Jacks (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). Wild-type MDM2 DNA was obtained from Steve Grossmann (Dana Farber Cancer Institute). DNA encoding myc-tagged ubiquitin (23Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar) was obtained from Ron Kopito (Stanford University). HA p53 Δ1–42 was generated by PCR using untagged p53 as a template. The 3′ primer for PCR was the SP6 primer, and the 5′ primer was 5′-GCGAATTCACCATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCTTTGATGCTGTCCCCGGACG-3′, which encodes the HA epitope and p53 sequence initiating at amino acid 43. To construct GFP p53 Δ1–42, the GFP p53 wild-type DNA was used as a PCR template with the following primers: 5′-CCGCTGCAGACCATGTTGATGCTGTCCCCG-3′ as the 5′ primer and 5′-CGGGGATCCCGGTCTGAGTCAGGCCC-3′ as the 3′ primer. The resulting PCR product was digested with PstI and BamHI and cloned into the corresponding sites in the pEGFP-N1 vector (CLONTECH). HA p53 W23S, untagged p53 Δ-oligomerization domain (OD; Δ324–357), and GFP p53 ΔOD DNAs were generated using the Quick Change mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The following oligonucleotides and their complementary oligonucleotides were used for the mutagenesis: for HA p53 W23S, 5′-CAGGAAGTAGTTTCGAAAGGTCTGAAAATGTTTCC-3′; and for untagged and GFP p53 ΔOD, 5′-GCCAAAGAAGAAACCACTCGAGCCA- GGGGGGAGCAGG-3′. Saos-2 or U2OS cells were grown in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin. Transfections were done using the calcium phosphate method in 35-mm dishes when the cells were ∼80% confluent. Sixteen to 20 h after addition of the DNA precipitate, cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium minus serum and refed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell extracts were prepared 8–10 h. later. For immunofluorescence staining, cells were plated on glass coverslips and were transfected, washed, and refed as described above. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.1 mmCaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C. Paraformaldehyde was then replaced with 50 mm NH4Cl for 5 min, and cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 plus 0.2% bovine serum albumin. p53 staining was carried out using the anti-HA monoclonal antibody HA.11 (Babco) as the primary antibody and rhodamine red-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) as the secondary antibody. MDM2 staining was carried out using the anti-MDM2 polyclonal antibody N-20 (Santa Cruz) as the primary antibody and 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetic acid-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) as the secondary antibody. Specimens were then examined under a fluorescent microscope. Cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mmNaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). The scraped cells were lysed on ice for 30 min with occasional light vortexing, followed by 15 min of centrifugation to remove cellular debris. Protein extracts were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a PolyScreen polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane (NEN Life Science Products). The membrane was probed with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody (HA.11; Babco), an anti-MDM2 monoclonal antibody (SMP-14; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), an anti-p53 monoclonal antibody (PAb1801 (Ab-2); Oncogene Science), or a monoclonal antibody against GFP (CLONTECH). For immunoprecipitations, 200 μg of transfected cell extract was immunoprecipitated with 0.4 μg of the anti-HA polyclonal antibody Y-11 (Santa Cruz). The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and examined by immunoblot analysis as described above. MDM2 can bind p53 and promote its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome (10Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3629) Google Scholar, 11Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2798) Google Scholar). The MDM2 binding domain is located in the p53 N terminus, and mutations within this region can inhibit p53-MDM2 binding and thus inhibit p53 ubiquitination. To disrupt p53-MDM2 binding, we generated p53 mutants in which either the N-terminal 42 amino acids were deleted (p53 Δ1–42) or that contained a single point mutation within the MDM2 binding domain (p53 W23S). Saos-2 cells (p53-null; Fig. 1,A and C) and U2OS cells (wild-type p53; Fig. 1,B and D) were transfected with expression DNAs encoding epitope-tagged (HA-tagged) versions of wild-type p53, p53 W23S, or p53 Δ1–42 alone or co-transfected with an excess of MDM2 DNA. Lysates from the transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were examined with an antibody against MDM2. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, lower panels, MDM2 was co-immunoprecipitated with HA-tagged wild-type p53 but not with the HA p53 W23S or Δ1–42 mutants. To observe p53 ubiquitination, the transfected cell lysates were then either immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody followed by immunoblot analysis with a second anti-HA antibody (Saos-2 cells) or examined by direct immunoblot analysis with an anti-HA antibody without prior immunoprecipitation (U2OS cells). As shown in Fig. 1,A and B, upper panels, a high molecular weight ladder of p53 species that are ubiquitin-p53 conjugates was detected in both cell types when HA-tagged wild-type p53 was expressed with MDM2, indicating that MDM2 could promote wild-type p53 ubiquitination. In contrast, neither HA p53 W23S nor HA p53 Δ1–42 was ubiquitinated with MDM2 expression. Furthermore, steady-state levels of HA wild-type p53 were decreased with MDM2 expression, indicative of MDM2-mediated p53 degradation, whereas levels of HA p53 W23S and HA p53 Δ1–42 remained unchanged (Fig. 1, C and D). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that an intact MDM2 binding domain within the p53 protein is necessary for MDM2 to ubiquitinate and degrade p53. Because p53 can exist as a homo-oligomer, we wished to determine whether p53 mutants that are deficient for MDM2 binding could bind MDM2 indirectly through oligomerization with wild-type p53. To this end, Saos-2 cells (Fig. 2, A andC) were transfected with different combinations of HA p53 W23S, MDM2, and untagged p53 that was wild type, lacked the C-terminal oligomerization domain (ΔOD), or lacked the N-terminal MDM2 binding domain (Δ1–42). Similarly, U2OS cells (Fig. 2, B andD) were transfected with various combinations of HA p53 Δ1–42, MDM2, and GFP-tagged p53 that was wild type, lacked the oligomerization domain (GFP p53 ΔOD), or lacked the N-terminal MDM2 binding domain (GFP p53 Δ1–42). In these experiments, equal amounts of p53 and MDM2 DNAs were transfected to facilitate detection of p53·MDM2 complexes despite p53 degradation. Lysates from the transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were examined first with antibodies against either p53 or GFP. As shown in Fig. 2 A, lower panel, untagged versions of both wild-type p53 and p53 Δ1–42 were co-immunoprecipitated with HA p53 W23S when these proteins were co-expressed in Saos-2 cells. Likewise, GFP wild-type p53 and GFP p53 Δ1–42 co-immunoprecipitated with HA p53 Δ1–42 when these proteins were co-expressed in U2OS cells (Fig. 2 B, lower panel). These results indicate that HA p53 W23S and HA p53 Δ1–42 could oligomerize with wild-type p53 and with forms of p53 that lacked the N-terminal 42 amino acids. In contrast, neither of the HA-tagged p53 mutants formed a complex with the p53 ΔOD mutants, indicating that complex formation required the p53 oligomerization domain (Fig. 2,A and B, lower panels). The HA immunoprecipitates were next examined with antibodies against MDM2. As shown in Fig. 2,A and B, upper panels, a large amount of MDM2 co-immunoprecipitated with the HA-tagged p53 mutants only when the p53 mutants were co-expressed with MDM2 and wild-type p53 but not when co-expressed with MDM2 and either p53 Δ1–42 or p53 ΔOD. These results indicate that the MDM2 binding-deficient mutants of p53 could bind MDM2 indirectly, and that this occurred through oligomerization with the wild-type p53 protein. Given that the HA p53 W23S and Δ1–42 mutants could bind MDM2 indirectly through oligomerization with wild-type p53, we next wished to determine whether these same p53 mutants could be targeted for ubiquitination when co-expressed with MDM2 and wild-type p53. Accordingly, lysates from the transfected cells were examined by immunoblot analysis with an anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig.3 A, HA p53 W23S was not ubiquitinated when expressed with MDM2 alone in Saos-2 cells but was efficiently ubiquitinated when expressed with both MDM2 and wild-type p53. Likewise, HA p53 Δ1–42 was not ubiquitinated when expressed with MDM2 alone (see Fig. 1 B) but was ubiquitinated when expressed with MDM2 and GFP-tagged wild-type p53 (Fig. 3 B). It should be noted that only modest levels of ubiquitinated HA p53 Δ1–42 were observed in these experiments compared with the ubiquitination of HA p53 W23S. We suspect this is attributable to the relatively low expression level of the HA p53 Δ1–42 mutant and to the relatively low level of MDM2 binding observed when the HA p53 Δ1–42 mutant was co-expressed with MDM2 and GFP-tagged wild-type p53 (Fig. 2 B and data not shown). Nonetheless, ubiquitin conjugates of HA p53 Δ1–42 were clearly evident when this mutant was expressed with GFP-tagged wild-type p53 and MDM2. Importantly, the HA p53 W23S mutant was not ubiquitinated when expressed in Saos-2 cells with either p53 Δ1–42 or p53 ΔOD, and HA p53 Δ1–42 was not ubiquitinated when expressed in U2OS cells with either GFP p53 Δ1–42 or GFP p53 ΔOD (Fig. 3, A and B). Taken together, these results indicate that p53 mutants that are unable to bind MDM2 directly can be targeted for ubiquitination by MDM2 when co-expressed with both MDM2 and wild-type p53. Furthermore, this ubiquitination requires MDM2 binding by the wild-type p53 protein and oligomerization between wild-type p53 and the MDM2 binding-deficient p53 mutants. MDM2-mediated ubiquitination is thought to promote the export of p53 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where p53 can then be degraded by cytoplasmic proteasomes (13Geyer R.K. Yu Z.K. Maki C.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 14Boyd S.D. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). We next wished to determine whether p53 mutants that are deficient in direct MDM2 binding could also be targeted for nuclear export when expressed with MDM2 and wild-type p53. To monitor nuclear export, the subcellular localization of HA wild-type p53 and HA p53 Δ1–42 was determined by immunofluorescence staining when expressed alone or when co-expressed with MDM2. As shown in Fig.4, A and B, both HA wild-type p53 and HA p53 Δ1–42 displayed a nuclear localization pattern when expressed alone. In contrast, HA wild-type p53 was relocalized to the cytoplasm in cells in which it was expressed with MDM2, whereas HA p53 Δ1–42 remained nuclear with MDM2 expression. Previous studies have demonstrated that the relocalization of wild-type p53 with MDM2 expression requires an NES in p53 and can be blocked by addition of the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B (Refs. 13Geyer R.K. Yu Z.K. Maki C.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 14Boyd S.D. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar and data not shown). These studies indicate that the cytoplasmic localization displayed when wild-type p53 is expressed with MDM2 results from increased p53 nuclear export. The fact that HA p53 Δ1–42 remains nuclear with MDM2 expression indicates that this mutant is resistant to nuclear export when expressed with MDM2 alone. To test whether the MDM2 binding domain could be provided through oligomerization for p53 nuclear export, cells were transfected with DNAs encoding HA p53 Δ1–42, MDM2, and GFP-tagged p53s that were either wild type, lacked the MDM2 binding domain (GFP p53 Δ1–42), or lacked the oligomerization domain (GFP p53 ΔOD). As shown in Fig.5, A and B, both HA p53 Δ1–42 and GFP wild-type p53 were nuclear when expressed alone but were exported from the nucleus and relocalized to the cytoplasm when co-expressed with MDM2. The fact that HA p53 Δ1–42 was exported under these conditions indicates that MDM2 can promote p53 nuclear export in the absence of direct p53-MDM2 binding. In contrast, HA p53 Δ1–42 remained nuclear when expressed with MDM2 and either GFP p53 Δ1–42 or GFP p53 ΔOD, and these GFP-tagged p53 proteins also remained nuclear (Fig. 5, A and B). These results indicate that the nuclear export of HA p53 Δ1–42 required oligomerization with wild-type p53 and MDM2 binding by the wild-type p53 protein. Finally, we wished to determine whether a p53 mutant deficient in direct MDM2 binding could also be targeted for degradation when expressed with MDM2 and wild-type p53. To this end, HA p53 Δ1–42 was co-expressed with GFP wild-type p53, GFP p53 Δ1–42, or GFP p53 ΔOD either alone or with MDM2. To facilitate p53 degradation, an expression DNA encoding myc-tagged ubiquitin was also included in these transfections, and the amount of MDM2 DNA transfected was in excess of the p53 DNA. As shown in Fig. 6, steady-state levels of both HA p53 Δ1–42 and GFP wild-type p53 were decreased when these two proteins were co-expressed with MDM2, indicating that MDM2 could promote the degradation of both proteins. The fact that HA p53 Δ1–42 was degraded in these experiments indicates that MDM2 can promote p53 degradation in the absence of direct p53-MDM2 binding. Importantly, HA p53 Δ1–42 was not degraded when expressed with MDM2 and either GFP p53 Δ1–42 or GFP p53 ΔOD, and these GFP-tagged p53 proteins were also not degraded. Taken together, these results support a model whereby the HA p53 Δ1–42 mutant of p53 could bind MDM2 indirectly through oligomerization with wild-type p53 and was subsequently targeted for ubiquitination (Fig.3), nuclear export (Fig. 5), and degradation (Fig. 6). Wild-type p53 functions as a tumor suppressor protein by activating the transcription of genes that mediate either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (4Prives C. Hall P.A. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar, 24Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6673) Google Scholar). Amino acids 1–42 in p53 comprise the transcriptional activation domain, and it is this region that binds MDM2. Residues 102–292 encode the sequence-specific DNA binding domain. p53 binds DNA as a tetramer, and the oligomerization domain is encoded by residues 327–355. In addition to affecting the DNA binding activity of p53, oligomerization has also been reported to affect the susceptibility of p53 to MDM2-mediated ubiquitination. For example, oligomerization-deficient mutants of p53 displayed low binding affinity for MDM2 and were relatively poor substrates for ubiquitination (25Maki C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16531-16535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar,26Kubbutat M.H. Ludwig R.L. Ashcroft M. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5690-5698Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). However, efficient ubiquitination was restored when an oligomerization-deficient p53 mutant was fused to the dimerization domain of a heterologous protein (25Maki C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16531-16535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These results indicate that oligomerization is required for wild-type p53 to efficiently bind and be targeted for ubiquitination by MDM2. Several studies have reported that an intact MDM2 binding domain is necessary for p53 to be degraded by MDM2. In the current study, we examined whether the MDM2 binding domain of p53 could be provided intrans through oligomerization between two p53 molecules. p53 proteins mutated in their MDM2 binding domains were unable to bind MDM2 directly and were resistant to MDM2-mediated ubiquitination, nuclear export, and degradation when expressed with MDM2 alone in either Saos-2 cells (p53-null) or U2OS cells (wild-type p53). However, these same p53 mutants formed a complex with MDM2 and were efficiently ubiquitinated, degraded, and exported from the nucleus when co-expressed with MDM2 and wild-type p53. Moreover, this effect required MDM2 binding by wild-type p53 as well as oligomerization between wild-type p53 and the MDM2 binding-deficient p53 mutants. Taken together, these results support a model whereby MDM2 binding-deficient forms of p53 can bind MDM2 indirectly through oligomerization with wild-type p53 and are subsequently targeted for ubiquitination, nuclear export, and degradation. It should be noted that targeting of the MDM2 binding-deficient p53 in U2OS cells required overexpression of the mutant with both wild-type p53 and MDM2, despite the fact that these cells express endogenous wild-type p53 protein. This could be because of the relatively low concentration of endogenous wild-type p53 compared with the overexpressed mutant or because the preexisting p53 in U2OS cells is already oligomerized and unavailable for oligomerization with the newly expressed mutant p53. The mechanisms that regulate the nuclear export of p53 have not been fully clarified. Original studies suggested that an NES within MDM2 was necessary for MDM2 to promote p53 degradation (27Roth J. Dobbelstein M. Freedman D.A. Shenk T. Levine A.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 554-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). On the basis of these findings, MDM2 was proposed to function as a molecular shuttle that would bind p53 and subsequently transport p53 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm via the MDM2 NES. More recent studies have suggested that the ability of MDM2 to ubiquitinate p53, and not the MDM2 NES, is required for MDM2 to promote the nuclear export of p53. According to this model, the addition of ubiquitin moieties is thought to expose an NES within the p53 C terminus, leading to the export of p53 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (13Geyer R.K. Yu Z.K. Maki C.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 14Boyd S.D. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In the current study, MDM2 could promote the nuclear export of a p53 mutant that lacked the ability to bind MDM2 directly. Moreover, MDM2 remained nuclear under conditions in which either wild-type p53 or an MDM2 binding-deficient mutant of p53 was exported to the cytoplasm (Figs. 4 and 5). These results are most consistent with a model in which activity of nuclear MDM2, and not MDM2 shuttling itself, is necessary to promote p53 nuclear export. Our results also invite consideration of the mechanisms that regulate p53 in response to DNA-damaging stress. Current models contend that the stabilization of p53 that occurs in response to DNA damage results from phosphorylation of p53 at one or more N-terminal sites. These phosphorylations are thought to inhibit p53-MDM2 binding and therefore stabilize the p53 protein (3Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar, 20Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Stavridi E.S. Halazonetis T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3471-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). The premise of this model is that modifications to p53 that inhibit its interaction with MDM2 would result in stabilization of the p53 protein. However, p53 can exist as an oligomer of multiple p53 molecules, and it has not been determined how many p53 molecules within a p53 oligomer would need to lose MDM2 binding capacity for the whole oligomer to be stabilized. In the current study, p53 mutants deficient in MDM2binding could oligomerize with wild-type p53 and bind MDM2 indirectly, and both the wild-type and mutant p53 proteins were then susceptible to MDM2-mediated degradation. This scenario may be considered similar to that in which an unmodified p53 molecule that can bind MDM2 oligomerizes with a phosphorylated p53 molecule that has lost MDM2 binding capacity in DNA-damaged cells. In light of our results, we predict that the phosphorylated p53 could oligomerize with the unmodified p53 and bind MDM2 indirectly as a result of this oligomerization, and that both the unmodified and phosphorylated p53 molecules would then be susceptible to degradation. Accordingly, most if not all of the molecules within a p53 oligomer may have to lose MDM2 binding capacity for the entire oligomer to be stabilized. Conversely, dephosphorylation of a single p53 molecule within a stabilized p53 oligomer may allow complex formation between the whole oligomer and MDM2. On the basis of our results, we predict that all molecules within that p53 oligomer would then be susceptible to MDM2-dependent degradation. This may serve as an effective means to rid the cell of excess p53 during recovery from a DNA damage-induced arrest."

These circular clamps require a multimeric clamp loader assembly for their opening and closure around DNA in a process that consumes ATP. In Escherichia coli the clamp is the β dimer, formed from two crescent-shaped protomers (5Kong X.P. Onrust R. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1992; 69: 425-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar), and the β ring is opened and closed by the γ complex clamp loader (γδδ′χψ). Once on DNA, β acts as a mobile tether for the replicase, DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, holding it to DNA for highly processive synthesis (1Stukenberg P.T. Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J.

In fact, the β subunit can also couple with all the other E. coli DNA polymerases (DNA polymerases I, II, IV, and V) (6Hughes Jr., A.J. Bryan S.K. Chen H. Moses R.E. McHenry C.S. J. Biol.

Here, the RFC1 clamp loader assembles the ring-shaped PCNA clamp onto DNA for processive DNA polymerase action (12Krishna T.S. Kong X.P. Gary S. Burgers P.M. Kuriyan J.

PCNA is also known to interact with several other proteins indicating that, like β, these clamps serve multiple roles in cellular DNA metabolism (14Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 236-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This report is part of a continuing study on the mechanism of theE. coli γ complex clamp loader. The γ complex consists of five different subunits (γδδ′χψ) (15Maki S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6555-6560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), three of which (γδδ′) are essential to clamp loading action (16Onrust R. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11766-11772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One copy each of the χ and ψ subunits bind the γδδ′ core but are not essential to clamp loading activity (17Onrust R. Finkelstein J. Turner J. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13366-13377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the γδδ′ complex has recently been solved, and it shows that there are three γ subunits and one each of δ and δ′ in a circular pentameric arrangement (18Jeruzalmi D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 106: 429-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). A protein in the holoenzyme known as τ is encoded by the same gene as γ (dnaX) and therefore is essentially identical to γ except for an extra C-terminal section in τ (19Tsuchihashi Z. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17790-17795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Flower A.M. McHenry C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3713-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Fully active clamp loading complexes can be reconstituted and are composed of one each of δ, δ′, and either τ3or γ3, or mixtures of τ and γ (i.e.τ1γ2 and τ2γ1) (17Onrust R. Finkelstein J. Turner J. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13366-13377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 21Pritchard A.E. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10291-10298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The unique C terminus of τ, lacking in γ, binds to the DNA polymerase III core and DnaB, thereby acting to organize the replisome machinery (22Yuzhakov A. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1999; 96: 153-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 23Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 643-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The γ (τ) subunit of the clamp loader is the only one that binds and hydrolyzes ATP, and thus is the motor of the clamp loader (19Tsuchihashi Z. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17790-17795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The δ subunit of γ complex forms a strong attachment to β and, in fact, opens or destabilizes one of the β dimer interfaces (25Turner J. Hingorani M.M. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 771-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 26Naktinis V. Onrust R. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 19182-19189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). No ATP is required for this (δ does not bind ATP); therefore, the energy for ring opening is derived from protein-protein interaction between δ and β. The recent crystal structure analysis of δ in complex with a monomer of β provides detailed insight into δ action (28Jeruzalmi D. Yurieva O. Zhao Y. Young M. Stewart J. Hingorani M. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 106: 417-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The way in which the δ subunit binds β leads to disruption of one of the dimer interfaces, preventing the ring from closing. Further, monomeric β forms a shallower crescent than each β protomer in the dimer, and thus the β subunit structure would appear strained to bend into a half-circle shape upon partnering with another β protomer to form a closed ring. Hence, upon cracking one dimer interface, the strain is released in the two β halves, allowing them to adopt shallower crescent shapes and resulting in significant widening of the gap at the open interface. The energy for clamp opening is supplied by the protein-protein interaction between δ and β. However, ATP is required by γ complex. What is the role of ATP if it is not required for clamp opening? Our studies on this subject reveal that the δ subunit is buried within γ complex such that its interaction with β is weak compared with the δ·B β complex (26Naktinis V. Onrust R. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13358-13365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Upon ATP binding to the γ subunits, however, the γ complex undergoes a conformational change that exposes δ for interaction with β (26Naktinis V. Onrust R. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13358-13365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 29Hingorani M.M. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24550-24563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Only in the presence of ATP and β does the ATP·γ complex·β composite show appreciable affinity for ssDNA (i.e. a site for DNA binding becomes exposed) (29Hingorani M.M. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24550-24563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 30Bertram J.G. Bloom L.B. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Beechem J.M. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24564-24574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Upon binding to DNA, especially a primed site, ATP is hydrolyzed and the connection between β and γ complex is severed (25Turner J. Hingorani M.M. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 771-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). At a primed site, this process results in a closed β ring encircling DNA. Docking of β onto the δ subunit of the crystal structure of γδδ′ (by replacing δ in the γδδ′ structure with the δ-β structure) suggests that γ may also bind to β (18Jeruzalmi D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 106: 429-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Our previous studies utilized gel filtration to detect the relatively strong interaction of δ subunit with β, but failed to detect an interaction of β with γ or any other subunit of γ complex (26Naktinis V. Onrust R. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13358-13365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Hence, we reexamined γ complex subunits for interaction with β in such a manner that we could detect even very weak interactions. This report reveals that, in addition to δ, γ and χ also interact with β, and possibly δ′ as well. Further, like δ, the γ subunit can open β, as inferred from its ability to increase its rate of dissociation from circular DNA. However, γ binds β weaker than δ and is ∼20-fold less efficient in unloading β from DNA compared with δ (kδunloading = 0.42 min−1; kγunloading = 0.016 min−1). The δ′ subunit does not appear to unload the β ring from DNA, but it binds δ and prevents δ from unloading β. δ′ also inhibits the γ unloading activity. Interestingly, the δ′-mediated inhibition of γ, and of γδ, is relieved upon adding ATP. Hence, δ′ is essential for coupling ATP to the action of γ and δ with β, even though ATP binds γ and not δ′. These interactions between γ complex subunits among themselves and β, and their regulation by δ′ and ATP, are discussed in terms of a molecular model of γ complex mechanism.

The γ complex was reconstituted from pure subunits and purified from unassociated proteins as described in our earlier study (17Onrust R. Finkelstein J. Turner J. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. J. Biol.

Cell. 1994; 78: 877-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). 32P-β used in this study had a specific activity of 150 dpm/fmol. The catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase produced in E. coli was a gift from Dr. Susan Taylor (University of California, San Diego, CA). Buffer A is 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 4% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm ATP, and 8 mm MgCl2. Buffer B is 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (Sigma), 2 mm DTT, 4% (v/v) glycerol, 8 mm MgCl2. Buffer C is Buffer B, but contains 2 mm MgCl2 and lacks ATP. 6× sample loading dye contains 0.25% bromophenol blue, 15% Ficoll, and 0.25% xylene cyanol. Buffer D contains 8.9 mm Tris, 8.9 mm sodium borate, and 0.2 mm EDTA. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) buffer contains 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, and 0.005% Tween 20. Replication Buffer contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 4% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 40 g/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP, and 8 mm MgCl2. The βmonomer was immobilized on a carboxymethyldextran matrix-coated sensor chip CM5 using carbodiimide covalent linkage in 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.5) to yield a final value of ∼7000 response units (RU) of immobilized βmonomer. The mobile phase (SPR buffer) contained 1 μm δ, 1 μm γ, 1 μm χ, or 1 μm δ′ or 1 μm χψ. SPR buffer containing protein was passed over the immobilized β at a flow rate of 6 μl/min for 5 min, after which SPR buffer lacking protein was injected over the chip. The β·DNA complex was prepared as substrate for clamp loading assays as follows. 32P-β (1.5 pmol) was incubated with 1 pmol of γ complex and 1.25 pmol of gpII nicked pBluescript plasmid DNA at 37 °C for 10 min in 50 μl of Buffer A. The reaction was applied to a 5-ml Bio-Gel A-15m gel filtration column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in Buffer B at room temperature, and fractions of 180 μl were collected. Because of the large size of the DNA, the32P-β·DNA complex elutes early (usually fractions 11–14) and separates from free 32P-β, γ complex, and ATP (in fractions 21–31). Three peak fractions (usually 11–13) containing 32P-β·DNA (determined by scintillation counting) were pooled for use as substrate in the unloading reactions. Proteins were analyzed for ability to unload clamps by mixing 0.4 nm32P-β·DNA substrate in 25 μl of Buffer B on ice with 25 μl of Buffer C containing δ, δ′, or γ3 (0.5–3.0 μm, as indicated in the plots or figure legend), and then the reaction was shifted to 37 °C for incubation. Reactions were quenched at various times (5–180 min, as indicated in the plots or figure legend) upon addition of 5 μm βmonomer (3 μl of 82 μmβmonomer), and then the quenched reaction was immediately placed on ice. We have shown previously that βmonomereffectively quenches δ-mediated β unloading (35Leu F.P. Hingorani M.M. Turner J. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34609-34618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and we find that it also quenches γ-mediated unloading of β (as discussed under “Results” and shown in Fig. 3). Next, 8 μl of 6× sample loading dye was added to the quenched reactions, followed by analysis in a 1.5% neutral agarose gel, which separates free 32P-β from 32P-β·DNA complex. Electrophoresis was for 1 h (100 V) at room temperature in Buffer D. Gels were then removed, fixed with 20% acetic acid for 10 min, and overlaid with one layer each of DE-81 paper, nitrocellulose membrane, Whatman 3M paper, and several paper towels, and then flattened under a lead brick until ∼3 mm thick. The flattened gel was then wrapped in plastic wrap and exposed to a phosphor screen (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for ∼12 h. Bands corresponding to 32P-β on and off DNA were visualized using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the amount of 32P-β in each band was quantitated using ImageQuant (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The fraction of β on DNA at each time point was calculated as the ratio of32P-β·DNA complex to total β (summation of free32P-β and 32P-β·DNA). This value was then normalized to 1.0 by dividing by the fraction of β on DNA at time 0 ([β on DNA]t/[β on DNA]t=0). Typically the percentage of total β on DNA at time 0 was 70–95%; the variability is likely the result of some spontaneous loss of β from DNA between the initial isolation of the substrate 32P-β·DNA, and the unloading experiment. Overall, clamp unloading reactions are second order, but because the concentration of catalyst in the reaction (e.g. δ or γ) is much higher than the substrate (32P-β·DNA), the reaction becomes pseudo first-order and the β unloading rate (k unloading) can be obtained at any particular δ or γ subunit concentration using the first-order equation: ([β·DNA]t/[β on DNA]t=0) = e(−k unloading)(t), where t = time. Data points from unloading time courses were fit to this equation to obtain the observedk unloading value at a given concentration of protein subunit (i.e. γ3, δ, δ′, or combination thereof). The k unloading values were then plotted versus the concentration of the protein subunit used as the catalyst for β unloading and then the best fit to the hyperbolic equation: k unloading= (k unloading(max))([γ3])/([γ3] + K d) was determined to obtain the apparent maximal β unloading rate (k unloading(max)) and the apparent K d value for interaction of the catalyst with the β·DNA complex. Assays that examine subunit mixtures for 32P-β unloading activity were performed upon mixing 0.4 nm32P-β·DNA in 25 μl of Buffer B with 25 μl of Buffer C containing some combination of δ (0.2–1.0 μm), γ3 (0.5–3 μm), and δ′ (0.5–5 μm). Subunit mixtures were preincubated for 10 min on ice before addition to the assay. Specifics are as follows. Assays that examined the effect of γ and/or δ′ on the ability of δ to unload β at a fixed time point (3 min) all contained 0.4 nm32P-β·DNA in Buffer B (25 μl) to which was added 25 μl of a mixture containing 1 μm δ and either γ (0.5, 1, 2, or 3 μm) or δ′ (0.5, 1, 2, 4, or 5 μm). Time courses of β unloading assays (0, 5, 15, and 30 min) performed using mixtures of either δγ or δδ′ contained 0.2 μm δ that was preincubated (25 μl) with either 1 μm γ3 or 1 μm δ′ before addition to the 32P-β·DNA substrate. Reactions containing three subunits were performed by preincubating 0.2 μm δ with either 2 μm each γ3 and δ′ or 3 μm each γ3and δ′, in the presence or absence of 1 mm ATP in 25 μl of Buffer B. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times or as described in the legend, and then quenched using βmonomer and analyzed on an agarose gel as described above. In reactions containing ATP, 1 mm final concentration of ATP was included in the protein pre-incubation reaction. In assays examining βmonomerinhibition of DNA synthesis, reactions contained 420 nm SSB (as tetramer), 1.4 nm M13mp18 ssDNA primed with a DNA 30-mer, and 0.3 μm γ complex in 25 μl of Replication Buffer. Following this, βmonomer was added to reactions on ice at 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, or 2.0 μmconcentration. Next, a mixture was added yielding final concentrations of 60 μm each of dATP, dGTP, and dCTP; 20 μm [α-32P]dTTP; 4.8 nm core (αεθ); and 8 nm β. The mixture was shifted to 37 °C for 3 min, and then quenched upon addition of 25 μl of 1% SDS, 40 mm EDTA. Reactions were spotted onto DE81 filters, washed as described (38Rowens L. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 758-764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. The effect of βmonomer on β clamp loading by the γ complex was performed in 100 μl of Buffer A containing 3 μm SSB (as tetramer), 10 nmM13mp18 ssDNA primed with a DNA 30-mer, 8 nm γ complex, and 5 μm βmonomer (when present). This reaction was brought to room temperature for 5 min, 32P-β was added to a final concentration of 10 nm, and the reaction was shifted to 37 °C for 5 min. Reactions were analyzed by gel filtration on a 5-ml Bio-Gel A15m column equilibrated in Buffer A as described above for preparation of the 32P-β clamp unloading substrate. In assays that examine the effect of βmonomer on β clamp unloading by γ and δ, the 50-μl reactions contained 0.2 nm32P-β·DNA, and reactions were initiated by the addition of either 0.5 μm δ or a mixture of 0.5 μmδ and 2 μm βmonomer. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 3 min and then were analyzed in a native agarose gel as described above for the clamp unloading assay. In assays that examine the effect of βmonomer on β clamp unloading by γ, procedures were as described above except that 1 μm γ, or a mixture of 1 μm γ and 5 μm βmonomer, was added and reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 80 min before analysis in a native agarose gel. To increase the possibility of detecting weak γ complex subunit interactions with β, we employed the SPR technique. In the SPR experiment of Fig. 1, we immobilized β on the chip surface. For this study we utilized a β mutant that contains two amino acid replacements, which disrupt the dimer interface resulting in a βmonomer (27Stewart J. Hingorani M.M. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19182-19189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Use of monomer β provides a stabile base line in SPR, compared with immobilized β dimer, which drifts down over time, probably because of slow dissociation of the protomer that is not directly cross-linked to the chip. In Fig. 1 A, δ was passed over the immobilized β and the formation of a δ-β complex was indicated by the resulting increase in mass (recorded as RU). Following the protein injection, buffer lacking δ was passed over the chip, resulting in dissociation of δ from β as indicated by loss of the signal. The time courses of mass accumulation, and mass loss provide information from which the rates of association and dissociation of δ-β complex can be calculated. The equilibrium constant calculated from these rates is ∼0.03 μm. In Fig. 1 B, passage of γ over β also demonstrated an interaction between them with an approximateK d of 0.9 μm (assuming γ as a trimer). γ appears to be a tetramer in solution (39Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29563-29569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), but it is trimeric when in association with δ and δ′ (40Pritchard A.E. Dallmann H.G. Glover B.P. McHenry C.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6536-6545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, for ease in comparing kinetic constants obtained using γ alone, and with δ and δ′, we have calculated the concentration of γ as a trimer for consistency throughout this report. If γ is considered a tetramer, the calculated equilibrium constant for the experiment in Fig. 1 B is ∼25% lower. Fig. 1 C examines δ′ for interaction with β; however, only very slight, or no, interaction was detected. Fig. 1 Ddemonstrates that χ interacts with β (∼K d = 1.1 μm). This χ-to-β interaction is not explored further in this report because neither the χ nor ψ subunits are required for clamp loading (41ODonnell M. Studwell P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1179-1187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Xiao H. Dong Z. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11779-11784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Glover B.P. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3017-3020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Further, we did not detect a significant effect of χ in the experiments of this report. The ψ subunit is not soluble, which prevented us from analyzing ψ for a ψ-to-β interaction. However, the ψ subunit is soluble as a χψ complex (34Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11785-11791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Glover B.P. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23476-23484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 E indicates that χψ complex binding to β gives a similar signal as χ alone (∼K d = 1.0 μm), suggesting that χ forms the major contact to β and that ψ may not make a significant contribution to the interaction between χψ and β. However, we cannot rigorously exclude the possibility of a ψ-β interaction from this data. The SPR analysis in Fig. 1 was performed using immobilized βmonomer because use of β dimer in SPR analysis is limited by dissociation of β2 during the experiment. However, it is important to keep in mind that δ interacts with βmonomer much tighter than β dimer. We do not know at present whether other γ complex subunits bind the βmonomer and β dimer with different affinities. We have reexamined ability to detect these complexes by gel filtration analysis using a Superose 12 column. Although we routinely detect δ-β complex by this method (26Naktinis V. Onrust R. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13358-13365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 27Stewart J. Hingorani M.M. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19182-19189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), we have not been successful in detecting an interaction between β and either γ, δ′, χ, χψ, γχψ, or γδ′χψ by gel filtration. 2A. Johnson and M. O'Donnell, unpublished results. As gel filtration is not an equilibrium technique, we presume that these complexes are too weak, and dissociate too fast, to be detected by this method. Inability to detect γ-β, χ-β, and χψ-β complex by gel filtration is consistent with the high K d values for these complexes determined from the SPR experiments of Fig. 1. Our previous studies showed that δ can open the β ring (25Turner J. Hingorani M.M. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 771-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 27Stewart J.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34609-34618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Ring opening by δ was deduced from experiments in which β was first assembled onto circular DNA, then adding δ subunit. Ability of δ to open β is detected by removal of the β ring from the circular DNA. To follow β dissociation from DNA, this assay utilizes a kinase-tagged version of β, which can be radiolabeled using [γ-32P]ATP and protein kinase. The 32P-β is then placed onto circular DNA using γ complex and ATP, followed by gel filtration to isolate the 32P-β·DNA complex from free β and γ complex/ATP. The 32P-β·DNA complex is then used as a substrate to examine γ complex and δ for unloading activity. If32P-β is unloaded from DNA, the amount of32P-β unloaded from DNA can be determined by analysis of the reaction in a native agarose gel (or by a second gel filtration column analysis). The 32P-β on DNA comigrates with the DNA substrate in the agarose gel and resolves from the free32P-β, which migrates faster through the gel. Using this procedure, we showed earlier that 32P-β has a"

UCP1 was also expressed in longitudinal smooth muscle of digestive and male reproductive tracts but was never expressed in other types of smooth muscle, including those of arterial vessels. In uterine tract, UCP1 content was increased after cold exposure or β-adrenergic agonist treatment. It was also up-regulated during the postovulatory period after sexual cycle synchronization. Its content transiently increased during gestation and decreased markedly after birth.

They are also involved in heat production and have other functions that are not directly related to energy transduction, such as redox state control and Ca2+ homeostasis. (1Zorov D.B. Krasnikov B.F.

(Lond.). 1999; 516: 1-17Crossref Scopus (527) Google Scholar). In all the functions, membrane potential and permeability play key roles. In specialized thermogenic cells, such as the brown adipocyte, increased proton conductance across the mitochondrial inner membrane was first postulated by Nicholls and Locke (3Nicholls D.G. Locke R.M. Physiol. Rev. 1984; 64: 1-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). The protein supporting this activity was later purified, named uncoupling protein (UCP),1 and cloned. This protein belongs to the mitochondrial anion carrier family. Its insertion into the mitochondrial inner membrane allows dissipation of the proton electrochemical gradient across this membrane with associated heat production and decreased ATP synthesis. Its ectopic expression in any eukaryotic cell is sufficient to reproduce similar uncoupled mitochondrial phenotypes (4Casteilla L. Blondel O. Klaus S. Raimbault S. Diolez P. Moreau F. Bouillaud F.

The recent cloning and expression studies of other UCPs, such as UCP2 and UCP3, suggest that similar mechanisms may exist in numerous cells. New perspectives with regard to UCPs and particularly UCP1 are now being revealed with the discoveries that UCPs are modulators of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation and that coenzyme Q is an obligatory partner for their uncoupling activity (6Negre-Salvayre A.

J. 2000; 345: 161-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Until now, only UCP1 has been clearly linked to thermogenesis and energy balance. Firstly, physiological regulation during cold exposure and starvation are consistent with this function, whereas this is not the case for other UCPs. Secondly, transgenic ablation of brown fat using a transgene overexpressing toxin under the control of UCP1 promoter (UCP1-DTA mice) led to a decrease in energy expenditure, hypergia, and obesity (9Lowell Susulic V.S.

Himms-Hagen J. Boyer B.B. Kozak L.P. Flier J.S. Nature. 1993; 366: 740-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar, 10Enerback S. Jacobsson A. Simpson E.M. Guerra C. Yamashita H. Harper M.E. Kozak L.P. Nature. 1997; 387: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, two particular features of transgenic models could not be easily explained: (i) in UCP1-DTA mice, altered reproductive function was described and (ii) in ucp1 −/− mice, the phenotype is more prominent in female compared with male mice (9Lowell Susulic V.S. Hamann A. Lawitts V.S.J.A. Himms-Hagen J. Boyer B.B. Kozak L.P. Flier J.S. Nature. 1993; 366: 740-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar, 10Enerback S. Jacobsson A. Simpson E.M. Guerra C.

According to these phenotypes, we postulated and investigated the putative ectopic expression of UCP1 protein in the female reproductive tract. Experiments were performed on female OF1 (IOPS caw) mice (IFFA-CREDO, L'Arbresle, France) weighing 26–30 g. Animals were housed in a controlled environment (12-h light/dark cycle and 21 °C) with free access to water and standard chow diet. During cold exposure, mice were caged individually at 4 °C for 6 days. To test the effect of β-adrenergic treatment, 0.5 μg/g of mouse/day of isoproterenol were injected intraperitoneally for 5 days. To synchronize mice hormonally, one group received 5 units of intraperitoneal pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin (to mimic follicle-stimulating hormone effect), and 46 h later, this group received 5 units of human chorionic gonadotropin (luteinizing hormone effect) to produce ovulation. The control group received normal saline. 24 or 36 h after the second injection, mice were killed by cervical dislocation after CO2anesthesia. The serum and uterus were immediately removed. The efficiency of hormonal treatment was confirmed by the measurement of sexual hormones by radioimmunoassay (Sorin Biomedica). The uteri were dissected free of adipose tissue and weighed; specimens were fixed on 3.6% formaldehyde-phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7, for histological analysis. Fragments were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until RNA analysis. The remaining tissue was quickly homogenized in sucrose buffer (with anti-proteases) to prepare mitochondrial fractions. Pregnant females were killed at various stages of gestation as indicated and 48 h after spontaneous delivery. Mitochondrial fractions were purified by differential centrifugation of tissue homogenates as described previously (12Miroux B. Casteilla L. Klaus S. Raimbault S. Grandin S. Clement J.M. Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13603-13609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 20 μg of protein from total homogenate or mitochondrial fractions were electrophoresed in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred (at 1 h) onto nitrocellulose. These membranes were systematically stained with Ponceau red to check that equal amounts of proteins were analyzed. Overnight incubation with the same rabbit IgG against mouse UCP1 (UCP1 11A, 0.25 μg/ml) and washings were performed. Peroxidase activity of the second antibodies (diluted 1:8000) was revealed using the ECL kit and Hyperfilm ECL-TM. The blots were exposed for 2–10 min. Positive control was performed with 0.05–2 μg of BAT mitochondria purified from rat BAT. After overnight fixation, tissues were dehydrated and paraffin-embedded. Sections (5–7 μm) were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 0.5 μg/ml UCP 11A. The second antibody coupled to alkaline phosphatase (1:200) was visualized using BCIP/NBT. Endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity was inhibited by levamisole. Slides were counterstained with nuclear red. With the double labeling method, UCP1 was revealed using Texas Red-conjugated AffiniPure F(ab′)2 fragment goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L), diluted 1:100, as the second antibody. Monoclonal mouse anti-human smooth muscle actin, diluted 1:50, was used as a marker for actin, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated horse anti-mouse IgG (H+L), diluted 1:100, was used as the second antibody. Control experiments were performed using purified rabbit IgG and yielded no staining. These experiments were performed on paraffin sections. All prehybridization, hybridization, and stringent washing steps were similar to our previously published method (13Brauner P. Nibbelink M. Flachs P. Vitkova I. Kopecky P. Mertelikova I. Janderova L. Penicaud L. Casteilla L. Plavka R. Kopecky J. Pediatr. Res. 2001; 49: 440-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, prehybridization was performed (3 h/42 °C) in 80 μl of 50% formamide in 5× SSC and salmon sperm DNA (250 μg/ml). Prehybridized sections were hybridized for 15 min at 70 °C and overnight at 42 °C in 50 μl of the same solution containing only 40 μg of ssDNA and the DIG-labeled riboprobes (0.5 μg/ml for UCP2 and 0.1 μg/ml for UCP1). Stringent washes consisted of 30 min in 2× SSC (room temperature), 60 min in 2× SSC (50 °C), 60 min in 0.2× SSC (50 °C), and equilibration (5 min) in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4. Subsequently, bound probe was detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antidigoxigenin antibody (1:500 diluted) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, catalog no. 1093274) and BCIP/NBT substrate. Sections were counterstained with nuclear red. The probes were prepared using the DIG RNA Labeling Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, catalog no. 1-175-025) by in vitro transcription. ABamHI-EcoRI fragment (180 bp) of UCP1 cDNA was ligated into BS-Ad1. A 261-bp antisense riboprobe was generated using T3 RNA polymerase (Stratagene) after SST2 digestion of the plasmid; this probe hybridizes with the 3′-non-coding sequence. A 220-bp sense was generated with T7 polymerase afterEcoRV digestion. A 182-bp mouse UCP2 riboprobe was obtained by PCR (with the primers 5′-CAGGTCACTGTGCCCTTACC-3′ and 5′-CATGGAGAGGCTCAGAAAGG-3′) and cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector. We obtained antisense riboprobe (272 bp) with T7 polymerase after SalI digestion and sense probe (286 bp) with SP6 polymerase and NcoI digestion. Total RNAs were prepared from pulverized tissues of non-pregnant female mice by the acidic guanidium isothiocyanate method (14Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). After a 10-min denaturation at 70 °C, 3 μg of these RNAs were incubated for 50 min in a 20-μl reverse transcriptase reaction mix containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm dNTP, 5.5 μmoligo(dT)15 primer, 10 units of RNase inhibitor (Promega, Madison, WI), and 200 units of RT SuperscriptTM II (Life Technologies, Inc.). Negative controls of the reverse transcription reaction were performed in the same conditions but without reverse transcriptase. The following primers were subsequently used to amplify a 198-bp fragment of UCP-1 cDNA (from position 584 to 763): sense 5′-AGACATCATCACCTTCCC-3′ and antisense 5′-CAGCTGTTCAAAGCACAC-3′ primers followed by nested sense 5′-GTGAAGGTCAGAATGCAAGC-3′ and antisense 5′-AGGGCCCCCTTCATGAGGTC-3′ primers. A 2-μl aliquot of reverse transcription reactions was used for UCP-1 cDNA amplification in a 50-μl reaction mix containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 200 μm dNTP, 1.25 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI), and 400 nm first sense and antisense primers. Following a 5-min denaturation at 94 °C, the PCR steps consisted of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C for several cycles, as indicated in the figure legends, followed by 7 min at 72 °C. 1 μl of a 1:50 dilution of this PCR reaction was used in the nested amplification, using nested sense and antisense primers. The conditions were exactly the same as in the first PCR. In parallel, a 499-bp fragment of actin cDNA (from position 165 to 664) was amplified using sense 5′-CGACGAGGCCCAGAGCAAG-3′ and antisense 5′-CTAGGGCAACATAGCACAGC-3′ primers in the same conditions as the first UCP-1 amplification but with 25 cycles. Amplification products were run onto 1.5% agarose gel in 0.5× TBE (90 mm Tris, 90 mm boric acid, and 50 mm EDTA, pH 8) containing ethidium bromide. The molecular weights of the PCR product were estimated using the kilobase ladder (MW1; Life Technologies, Inc.) or the low molecular mass ladder (MW2; Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium). Purified rabbit IgG against mouse UCP1 (UCP 11A) were purchased from Alpha Diagnostic International Company (San Antonio, TX). Monoclonal mouse anti-human smooth muscle actin (clone 1A4; M O851), alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (D-0314), BCIP/NBT (K-598) and levamisole (X-3021), and “antibody diluent” (S-3022) were all obtained from Dako Corporation (Carpinteria, CA). Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated AffiniPure F(ab′)2 fragment donkey anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (711 056-152) and Texas Red-conjugated AffiniPure F(ab′)2fragment goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (111-076-045) were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Anti-rabbit IgG, peroxidase-linked species-specific whole antibody (from donkey), HybondTM-P Transfer membranes (RPN 2020F), ECL revelation kit (RPN 2106), and Hyperfilm ECL-TM (RPN 310–3H) were obtained fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech. DIG RNA Labeling Kit and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antidigoxigenin antibody were obtained fromRoche Molecular Biochemicals. fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated horse anti-mouse IgG (H+L) was provided by Vector Laboratories, Inc. (Burlingame, CA). Pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin (Folligon) and human chorionic gonadotropin (Cloruban) were purchased from Intervert (Angers, France). Radioimmunoassay kits were obtained from Sorin Biomedica (Saluggia, VC, Italy). To establish the specificity of UCP1 11A antibody, it was compared with an antibody directed against whole UCP1 purified from rat BAT known to detect UCP2 (15Ricquier D. Barlet J.P. Garel J.M. Combes-George M. Dubois M.P. Biochem. J. 1983; 210: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Whereas the latter detected a positive signal both in brown fat and in thymus mitochondrial fractions (known to highly express UCP2), the UCP1 11A antibody only revealed one protein in BAT (Fig. 1). Negative results were also obtained with mitochondrial fractions purified from heart and skeletal muscles in which UCP3 is highly expressed (data not shown). Putative UCP1 expression in the uterus was investigated using the specific UCP1 11A antibody and RT-PCR technology. As shown in Fig. 2 A, this antibody (used in Western blot experiments with uterine protein fractions) detected a positive signal at the same molecular weight as that detected in brown fat mitochondria. This signal was stronger in proteins from mitochondrial fractions than in total protein fractions. This is consistent with the mitochondrial localization of the protein. To establish the identity of this signal with the highest specificity and sensitivity, nested RT-PCR was performed. As expected, no signal was observed in control RT-PCR nor in NIH3T3 or 10T1/2 cell lines used as negative controls (Fig. 2 B and data not shown). In contrast, a single band at the expected size (198 bp) was obtained from uterine RNA (Fig. 2 B). Its cloning and sequencing confirmed the perfect homology with the published mouse UCP1 mRNA sequence (16Jacobsson A. Stadler U. Glotzer M.A. Kozak L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 16250-16254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 B, the signal intensity of the RT-PCR product was proportional to the number of PCR rounds. To determine the cell type expressing UCP1 gene, immunocytochemistry experiments were performed on the reproductive tract. As shown in Fig. 3, the uterus was clearly stained with anti-UCP1 antibody (Fig. 3 B). No staining was observed when the UCP1 antibody was omitted (data not shown). The use of antibody against smooth muscle actin isoform demonstrated that the strong positive fields correspond to the longitudinal layers of smooth cells (Fig. 3 A). Surprisingly, no labeling was observed in circular smooth cells (Fig. 3 B). The co-localization was confirmed by fluorescent double labeling (Fig. 3, C andD). Examination at a higher magnitude revealed clear signals longitudinally organized into smooth muscle cells (Fig. 3 E). We never observed contaminating brown fat cells. The same antibody was unable to detect any signal in cardiac or skeletal muscle cells strongly expressing UCP3 nor in the different population of macrophages known to highly express UCP2 (data not shown). To confirm the nature of the detected protein, in situ hybridization experiments were performed and gave identical results (Fig. 3 G). The detection of UCP2 mRNA by cross-hybridization of the probe could be excluded because signals obtained with the UCP2 antisense probe were quite different and did not correspond to circular muscle layers (Fig. 3 H). The examination of other tissues containing smooth muscle (Fig. 4) demonstrated that in male reproductive, urinary, and digestive tracts, UCP1 11A antibody specifically stained the smooth muscle cells of the longitudinal muscle layer. No signal could be detected in circular layers, including those of large arterial vessels (Fig. 4 P).Figure 4Immunohistochemical detection of UCP1 in male reproductive, digestive, and urinary tracts.

The scale is indicated on the lower left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Considering the large number of tissues in which UCP1 expression was detected, we focused our investigations on the uterine tract. Cold and adrenergic induction is a characteristic feature of the UCP1 gene among the UCP family. To test for similar regulation, we performed Western blot analysis of mitochondrial fractions from mice exposed to cold for 6 days or treated with isoproterenol, a β-adrenergic agonist. In both cases, treatments enhanced the signal detected by antibodies (Fig. 5, A and B). These changes were confirmed by histological examination of the uterus from control animals compared with isoproterenol-treated mice (Fig. 3,E and F, respectively). The increase in uterine UCP1 content was also observed after ovulation in mice synchronized by hormonal treatment (Fig. 5 C). Finally, we investigated changes in UCP1 content during gestation (Fig. 6). UCP1 content in mitochondrial fractions increased during the beginning of gestation and reached its maximal value during the last third of gestation. This content abruptly decreased after birth to return to the control value. The main results of this study are that UCP1 expression can no longer be considered as restricted to brown adipocytes and that in the tissues tested, it is specifically expressed in longitudinal smooth muscle layers. Atypical expression of UCP1 had already been described in liver and muscles (17Yoshida T. Umekawa T. Kumamoto K. Sakane N. Kogure A. Kondo M. Wakabayashi Y. Kawada T. Nagase I. Saito M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: E469-E475PubMed Google Scholar, 18Shinohara Y. Shima A. Kamida M. Terada H. FEBS Lett. 1991; 293: 173-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These observations have been attributed to cross-detection between the different UCPs (17Yoshida T. Umekawa T. Kumamoto K. Sakane N. Kogure A. Kondo M. Wakabayashi Y. Kawada T. Nagase I. Saito M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: E469-E475PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ricquier D. Raimbault S. Champigny O. Miroux B. Bouillaud F. FEBS Lett. 1992; 303: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The existence of other UCPs, and particularly, the broad range of UCP2 tissular expressions further confirmed the exclusive occurrence of UCP1 gene expression in brown adipocytes. To exclude any false interpretation, we carefully validated the different tools and techniques we used. The specificity of the UCP1 11A antibody was confirmed by a variety of data. Firstly, this antibody is unable to detect UCP-like proteins in thymus or muscle, whereas other antibodies do. Secondly, these results were confirmed by alternative methods using RNA detection, such as RT-PCR or in situ hybridization. In the latter case, the experiment on the uterus using UCP2 antisense probe excludes any cross-detection with UCP2. Finally, the sequence of the RT-PCR fragment definitively establishes that UCP1 expression is not unique to brown adipocytes but can occur in smooth muscles. The striking feature of this atypical expression of UCP1 is that, in all tissues examined, it only takes place in longitudinal smooth muscle layers. To define the physiological importance of such expression, we focused our investigations on the uterine tract. Indeed, among positive tissues, this one is easy to sample, and the relative importance of the different muscle layers is well known according to physiological situations (20Riemer R.K. Heymann M.A. Pediatr. Res. 1998; 44: 615-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 21Wray S. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C1-C18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this tissue, the UCP1 content in the whole uterus could be estimated to be 1000-fold lower than that detected in brown fat mitochondria. This explains the lack of UCP1 detection by classic methods such as Northern blotting (22Masaki T. Yoshimatsu H. Chiba S. Kurokawa M. Sakata T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1440: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). A major feature of the UCP1 gene is its induction by low temperatures and β-adrenergic agonist treatment (23Kozak L.P. Harper M.E. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 339-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 24Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. J. Physiol. 2000; 529, Part 1: 3-10Crossref Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Both treatments strongly induced the protein in the uterus as well. These results confirm the identity of the detected protein. This strongly suggests that the uterine expression of UCP1 could be involved in non-shivering thermogenesis and is also consistent with the higher sensitivity ofucp1 −/− females to cold exposure (10Enerback S. Jacobsson A. Simpson E.M. Guerra C. Yamashita H. Harper M.E. Kozak L.P. Nature. 1997; 387: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). A complementary role could be an involvement in the changes in body temperature that naturally occur during the menstrual cycle after ovulation (25Owen Jr., J.A. Am J. Clin. Nutr. 1975; 28: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This is indeed reinforced by the postovulatory increase of UCP1 content in uterine mitochondria. In the uterus, the longitudinal and circular smooth muscle layers control the progression and/or retention, respectively, of the fetus. Indeed, the uterus must expand enormously during pregnancy to accommodate the growing fetus and to support it through sustained muscle tone without generating propagated contractions (20Riemer R.K. Heymann M.A. Pediatr. Res. 1998; 44: 615-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). During this time, adrenergic effects are opposite between the two uterine smooth muscle layers; the contractile effect via the action on α1 receptor and the relaxing effect via β-adrenergic receptor predominate until term in the circular and longitudinal myometrium, respectively. After pregnancy, adrenergic stimulation is down-regulated by different mechanisms (21Wray S. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C1-C18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These changes are remarkably consistent with the localization of UCP1 expression and its changes after β-adrenergic stimulation and during pregnancy. The uterine role of UCP1 could consist of an effect on cellular energetic processes, inducing an inactive and quiescent contractile state in the positive smooth cells. This body of proof is conclusive enough for us to assume that UCP1 via its uncoupling property could control the mitochondria functions of longitudinal smooth muscle cells. Among these functions, ATP synthesis is the most obvious, but it does not exclude the involvement of UCP1 in reactive oxygen species metabolism and signaling pathways (6Negre-Salvayre A. Hirtz C. Carrera G. Cazenave R. Troly M. Salvayre R. Pénicaud L. Casteilla L. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). This, in turn, could alter contractile properties of longitudinal smooth muscle layer. Its expression in these cells could partly be involved in the different contractile properties of uterine muscle layers that permit the maintenance of the fetus during the gestation and then its expulsion (20Riemer R.K. Heymann M.A. Pediatr. Res. 1998; 44: 615-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This agrees with the reported reproductive disturbances of UCP1-DTA mice (11Hamann A. Flier J.S. Lowell B.B. Z. Eraehrwiss. 1998; 37: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that, in this physiological situation, UCP1 action could be facilitated by the increase of blood fatty acids occurring during gestation that stimulates the uncoupling activity of UCP1. Altogether, this report demonstrates that UCP1 is not specific to brown adipocytes. In addition, our data suggest that as well as its involvement in thermogenesis after cold exposure or during the sexual cycle, it may play a role in other functions such as contraction. Our data agree well with uterine biology and open new perspectives, which must be closely investigated, concerning the physiological and pathophysiological importance of UCP1 in numerous contractile tracts. Indeed, by analogy, we can reasonably assume that UCP1 may similarly participate in the contractile properties of the urinary, digestive, and reproductive tracts. This indirectly emphasizes the importance of mitochondria and their coupling in these tissues. We thank D.

To test a new anti-apoptosis strategy for neuroprotection, we engineered nontoxic components of anthrax toxin into a Bcl-XL delivery system. Delivery of Bcl-XL by this system prevented apoptosis of cultured rat cerebellar granule cells and macrophages, and the prevention depended on both the Bcl-XL and the anthrax toxin receptor binding/translocation moieties. Furthermore, neuronal death in vivo in a retinal ganglion cell model of axotomy-induced apoptosis was inhibited by administration of this fusion protein. Thus, Bcl-XL protein can be delivered into cells from the medium or interstitial space, offering a new way to block apoptosis upstream of many caspases and the mitochondria dysfunction phase of apoptosis.

Bcl-XL knockout mice diein utero around embryonic day 13 and exhibit extensive apoptotic death of neurons in the brain, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglia (21Motoyama N. Wang F. Roth K.A. Sawa H. Nakayama K. Nakayama K. Negishi I. Senju S. Zhang Q. Fujii S. Loh D.Y. Science. 1995; 267: 1506-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). In contrast, Bcl-2 is widely expressed in the developing nervous system, although, in the adult, expression persists at high levels only in the peripheral nervous system (22Merry D.E. Veis D.J. Hickey W.F. Korsmeyer S.J. Development. 1994; 120: 301-311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas the brains from embryonic homozygous Bcl-2 knockout mice appear to be grossly normal (23Veis D.J. Sorensen C.M. Shutter J.R. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 229-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar), the facial motoneurons and spinal cord sensory and sympathetic neurons exhibit degeneration postnatally (24Michaelidis T.M. Sendtner M. Cooper J.D. Airaksinen M.S. Holtmann B. Meyer M. Thoenen H. Neuron. 1996; 17: 75-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Thus, Bcl-2 appears to be necessary for postnatal peripheral neuronal survival, whereas Bcl-XL plays a more important role in preventing death in the central nervous system. In vitro neuronal apoptosis induced by growth factor deprivation or cytotoxic drugs is delayed by overexpression of Bcl-2 (25Sastry P.S. Rao K.S. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). In Bcl-2 transgenic mice, Bcl-2 overexpression blocks naturally occurring neuronal death (26Martinou J.-C. Dubois-Dauphin M.

Similarly, Bcl-XL overexpression inhibits axotomy-induced (32Parsadanian A.S. Cheng Y. Keller-Peck C.R. Holtzman D.M. Snider W.D.

Although Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL have potential to inhibit neurodegeneration, it is not now clinically practical to deliver genes to the brain. However, the transient delivery of anti-apoptotic proteins into neurons could help prevent neuronal death associated with traumatic injury and neurological diseases. Previously, Bcl-XL fused to the diphtheria toxin receptor binding domain, Bcl-XL-DTR, was found to prevent apoptosisin vitro induced by staurosporine, γ-irradiation, and poliovirus (34Liu X.-H. Castelli J. Youle R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9563-9567Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, as diphtheria toxin receptors are present only on human and primate cells and the Bcl-XL-DTR protein does not inhibit apoptosis in rat and mouse cells (34Liu X.-H. Castelli J. Youle R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9563-9567Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), in vivoutility of the Bcl-XL fusion protein in rodent models could not be evaluated. A nontoxic derivative of anthrax toxin has been shown to be a useful system to deliver peptides into the cytosolic compartment of mammalian cells (35Leppla S.H. Moss J. Iglewski B. Vaughan M. Tu A.T. Handbook of Natural Toxins. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 543-572Google Scholar). Anthrax toxin comprises three components: lethal factor (LF),1 edema factor (EF), and protective antigen (PA) (35Leppla S.H. Moss J. Iglewski B. Vaughan M. Tu A.T. Handbook of Natural Toxins. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 543-572Google Scholar). PA binds to an unidentified cell surface receptor existing on the cells of many species including rodents (35Leppla S.H. Moss J. Iglewski B. Vaughan M. Tu A.T. Handbook of Natural Toxins. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 543-572Google Scholar,36Friedlander A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7123-7126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and, after being proteolytically activated, binds and transports LF or EF into cells (35Leppla S.H. Moss J. Iglewski B. Vaughan M. Tu A.T. Handbook of Natural Toxins. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 543-572Google Scholar). PA alone is not toxic (35Leppla S.H. Moss J. Iglewski B. Vaughan M. Tu A.T. Handbook of Natural Toxins. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 543-572Google Scholar). The first 254 residues of LF (LFn), which constitute the PA-binding domain, can mediate the delivery of heterologous peptides into the cytosol (35Leppla S.H. Moss J. Iglewski B. Vaughan M. Tu A.T.

Initially, two splicing isoforms were discovered for human Bcl-X: Bcl-XL and Bcl-XS (19Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nunez G. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar). Shortly thereafter, an alternatively spliced form of Bcl-XL lacking the C-terminal membrane anchor, Bcl-XΔTM, was identified in mouse cells (44Fang W. Rivard J.J. Mueller D.L. Behrens T.W. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4388-4398PubMed Google Scholar). Bcl-XL and Bcl-XΔTM both inhibit apoptosis, whereas Bcl-XS promotes apoptosis. We fused human Bcl-XL and a truncated Bcl-XL lacking C-terminal membrane anchor (ΔBcl-XL, similar to mouse Bcl-XΔTM) to LFn and explored their effects on apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. The gene for LF from codons 34 to 288 (LFn) (45Bragg T.S. Robertson D.L. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 81: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR from the template of pET15b/LFn (38Milne J.C. Blanke S.R. Hanna P.C. Collier R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 661-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The genes of full-length human Bcl-XL and C-terminal truncated human Bcl-XL from codons 1 to 209 (ΔBcl-XL) (19Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nunez G. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar) were amplified by PCR, and the LFn gene was fused to the 5′ end of the Bcl-XL gene or the ΔBcl-XL gene by a second round of PCR. A stop codon was introduced immediately after the last codon of full-length Bcl-XL or codon 209 of Bcl-XL. The fused DNA fragments, LFn-Bcl-XL and LFn-ΔBcl-XL, were cut with NdeI and XhoI and separately inserted into the prokaryotic expression vector pET15b cut with NdeI and XhoI (Fig. 1 A). A histidine tag and a thrombin cleavage site were linked to the N terminus of LFn-Bcl-XL or LFn-ΔBcl-XL. Similarly, the ΔBcl-XL gene alone was also cloned into pET15b at the NdeI andXhoI sites. All the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The genes of LFn-Bcl-XL, LFn-ΔBcl-XL (Fig. 1 A), full-length Bcl-XL, and ΔBcl-XL were separately cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 and verified by DNA sequencing. COS-7 cells were transfected separately with the above four plasmids, and 12 h after transfection the cell lysates were loaded on SDS-PAGE, visualized by immunoblotting with anti-Bcl-XL monoclonal antibodies (2H12, Trevegen, Gaithersburg, MD), and developed by using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (Fig. 1 B). As reported, COS-7 cells were co-transfected with one of the four above plasmids and the reporter plasmid, pEGFP-3C, which contains the green fluorescence protein (GFP) gene (46Wolter K.G. Hsu Y.-T. Smith C.L. Nechushtan A. Xi X.-G. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). The cells were treated with 0.8 μm staurosporine (STS) 12 h later. The dead and living cells expressing GFP were then counted at different times after STS treatment as reported previously (34Liu X.-H. Castelli J. Youle R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9563-9567Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 46Wolter K.G. Hsu Y.-T. Smith C.L. Nechushtan A. Xi X.-G. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). The proteins LFn, LFn-Bcl-XL, LFn-ΔBcl-XL, and ΔBcl-XL were individually expressed in Escherichia coliBL21(DE3) (Novagen, Inc.) and purified with the His·Tag binding purification kit (Novagen, Inc.). The transformed BL21(DE3) were cultured at 37 °C in LB medium until the A 600reached 0.5–0.8, then treated with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and cultured for another 3 h. The cells expressing LFn-Bcl-XL were pelleted and lysed with a French press. The inclusion bodies were collected and dissolved in 6 m guanidine·HCl. His·Tag binding resin (Novagen) was used to purify LFn-Bcl-XL. LFn-Bcl-XL was refolded by dialysis against, or dilution into, 100 mm Tris·acetate (pH 8.0) plus 0.5 m arginine, concentrated with polyethylene glycol 15,000–20,000, and dialyzed against PBS. The cells expressing LFn, LFn-ΔBcl-XL, and ΔBcl-XL were pelleted and disrupted with a French press. The cytosol was loaded on the His·Tag binding column. The eluted proteins were dialyzed against PBS. PA was purified as reported (47Miller C.J. Elliott J.L. Collier R.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10432-10441Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The proteins were run on SDS-PAGE gels and stained with Coomassie Blue or visualized by immunoblotting with anti-Bcl-XL monoclonal antibodies (2H12) and developed by using enhanced chemiluminescence (Fig. 2). J744 macrophage-like cells at 105/ml were plated in 96-well plates in 100 μl of RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum/well and cultured overnight. The cells were treated with 0.1 μm STS along with different combinations of proteins or with PA or with PBS. The apoptotic and living cells were counted with Hoechst 33342 as reported elsewhere (34Liu X.-H. Castelli J. Youle R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9563-9567Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Cerebellar granule cells were prepared from 8-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat pups (15–19 g, Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY) as described by Levi et al. (48Levi G. Aloisi F. Ciotti M.T. Gallo V. Brain Res. 1984; 290: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The cells at 4 × 105/ml were plated in 96-well plates in 100 μl of basal Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mmglutamine, and 25 mm KCl per well. The cells were treated with 2.5 μg/ml Ara-C 24 h later to eliminate non-neuronal cells and cultured for 6 more days. The cerebellar granule cells were treated with PBS, 0.1 μm STS alone, 0.1 μm STS along with LFn-ΔBcl-XL (47 μg/ml) plus PA (39 μg/ml), or with 0.1 μm STS along with different protein combinations. The apoptotic and living cells were counted with Hoechst 33342. J774 cells were transfected or co-transfected with the gene for GFP-bad, the genes for GFP-bad and Bcl-XL, or the genes for GFP-bad and ΔBcl-XL. The GFP-bad gene was in pEGFP-3C, and Bcl-XL or ΔBcl-XL was in pcDNA3. 12 h later, the cells transfected with GFP-bad were treated with proteins LFn-ΔBcl-XL (60 μg/ml) plus PA (55 μg/ml). Five hours later, cell lysates were made and loaded onto SDS-PAGE, immunoblotted with antibody against phospho-Bad (Ser-136) 2S. H. Yoon, K. Sanders, X.-H. Liu, Y.-T. Hsu, C. L. Smith, S. Frank, and R. J. Youle, submitted for publication. or antibody against Bad (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) and developed with enhanced chemiluminescence. The P0 pups of Fisher 344 rats were used for the present study. P0 is defined as the day of birth. The intracranial lesion of unilateral optic nerve was performed as reported (3Rabachi S. Bonfanti L. Liu X.H. Maffei L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5292-5301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a P0 pup was anesthetized by hypothermia. Under a dissecting microscope, an incision over the right eye was cut and a piece of bone flipped up. The right optic nerve was sectioned after suctioning the overlying tissue. The section site of the optic nerve is about 3 mm away from the eyeball. A piece of gelfoam was put in the hole, the bone was placed back, and the incision repaired with superglue. Immediately after the operation, LFn-ΔBcl-XL (0.65 μg) along with PA (0.35 μg) or PA alone (0.35 μg) or LFn-ΔBcl-XL (0.65 μg) alone or PBS in a volume of 350 nl was injected through ora serrata into the posterior chamber of the eye by using a microinjector with a pulled micropipette. The pup was warmed up with a light lamp until the recovery, and then returned to the mother. 24 h after sectioning of the optic nerve, the right eyes were taken out under deep anesthesia with sodium pentobarbital, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for ∼30 h, embedded in paraffin, and cut at 6 μm. The eyes taken from the normal pups in the same litters were processed in the same way and taken as controls. The sections were rehydrated, stained with 0.2% cresyl violet, dehydrated, and mounted with DPX mountant. The pyknotic and living cells of the entire retinal ganglion cell layer of three sections per retina were counted by the use of a 40× objective. The pyknotic cells were identified as reported (3Rabachi S. Bonfanti L. Liu X.H. Maffei L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5292-5301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The values were presented as the percentage of pyknotic cellsversus total cells (see Fig. 6 B). Bcl-XL was fused to the C terminus of LFn, leaving the Bcl-XL hydrophobic tail free in the resulting recombinant protein, LFn-Bcl-XL. An additional construct, lacking the Bcl-XL hydrophobic tail (LFn-ΔBcl-XL), was made to examine whether this tail, which targets Bcl-XL to mitochondria, would help or hinder cell entry via the anthrax toxin (Fig.1 A). To compare the potential bioactivity of these two fusion proteins, the genes were transfected into mammalian cells prior to apoptosis induction by STS, a potent protein kinase inhibitor. LFn-ΔBcl-XL inhibited apoptosis induced by staurosporine similarly to full-length LFn-Bcl-XL whereas native Bcl-XL or ΔBcl-XL transfected into cells was slightly more active (Fig.1 C). The expression of the four transfected proteins was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 1 B). To prepare these Bcl-XL fusion proteins for extracellular delivery, the proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography to near homogeneity, as shown by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig.2 A). The control proteins LFn and ΔBcl-XL were also expressed in E. coli and purified. The composition of LFn-Bcl-XL and LFn-ΔBcl-XL was confirmed by Western blotting with anti-Bcl-XL antibody (Fig. 2 B). The biological activity of the LFn-Bcl-XL and LFn-ΔBcl-XL proteins was initially evaluated in tissue culture. LFn-Bcl-XL or LFn-ΔBcl-XL and the anthrax toxin receptor binding and entry domain (PA) were added to the medium of J774 cells immediately after apoptosis was induced by STS. Cells treated with STS died by apoptosis over the following 36 h as shown in Fig.3 A. However, when the cells were treated with LFn-Bcl-XL plus PA or LFn-ΔBcl-XL plus PA, most of the cell death was inhibited. Controls were performed to evaluate the requirements for apoptosis inhibition. Fig. 3 B shows that J774 cells treated with LFn alone, ΔBcl-XL alone, LFn-ΔBcl-XL without PA, and PA without LFn-ΔBcl-XL were not protected from apoptosis induced by STS, whereas LFn-ΔBcl-XL with PA prevented more than half of the cell death (p < 0.001). This indicates that ΔBcl-XL uses the anthrax toxin entry pathway to access the cell cytosol. Interestingly, LFn protein fused to Bcl-XL without the C-terminal hydrophobic tail appeared to prevent apoptosis to an extent similar to LFn protein fused to full-length Bcl-XL protein, indicating that the C terminus of Bcl-XL is not essential for the anti-apoptosis activity. This is consistent with certain previous studies in which C terminus-truncated Bcl-XL retained apoptosis inhibition activity (44Fang W. Rivard J.J. Mueller D.L. Behrens T.W. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4388-4398PubMed Google Scholar, 46Wolter K.G. Hsu Y.-T. Smith C.L. Nechushtan A. Xi X.-G. Youle R.J. J.

Similarly, Bcl-2 lacking the C-terminal hydrophobic tail retains anti-apoptosis activity (50Borner C. Martinou I. Mattmann C. Irmler M. Schaerer E. Martinou J.-C. Tschopp J. J.

Cell. 1993; 75: 241-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3297) Google Scholar), although truncating the C-terminal tail can impair the potency of apoptosis inhibition (52Hockenbery D.M.

Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16521-16524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We determined the stability of LFn-ΔBcl-XL apoptosis inhibition by adding it to the cell media at various times prior to STS treatment. The pretreatment of cells with LFn-ΔBcl-XL up to 10 h before STS treatment is as effective as the treatment at the same time in preventing cells from apoptosis (Fig. 3 C). Thus, the protein efficacy remains stable for at least 10 h. The protein was also partially effective at preventing cell death when added up to 1 h after apoptosis induction (Fig. 3 C). The potency of LFn-ΔBcl-XL was measured by examining its dose response in apoptosis protection. When less potent doses of STS are applied to cells that initiate only 15–20% apoptosis after 30 h, LFn-ΔBcl-XL can block over 80% of the cell death (Fig. 3 D). When the dose of PA is kept constant at 33 μg/ml, the dose of LFn-ΔBcl-XL that is half-maximal at apoptosis prevention is less than 2 μg/ml or less than 40 nm (Fig. 3 D). Thus, LFn-ΔBcl-XL offers an extremely potent mechanism to prevent cell death. As the C-terminal truncated LFn-ΔBcl-XL is more soluble and easier to purify, we explored the potential of this protein in models of neuronal death in vitro and in vivo. We examined the effect of LFn-ΔBcl-XL on apoptosis of primary rat cerebellar granule cells. The LFn-ΔBcl-XL protein combined with PA inhibited STS-induced apoptosis of these neurons by about 30% after 45 h (p = 0.0017) (Fig. 4). However, ΔBcl-XL alone, LFn-ΔBcl-XL alone, PA alone, and PA plus LFn lacked significant bioactivity. Thus, in primary neuron cultures, as in the cultured macrophage cell line, ΔBcl-XL protein can be delivered via the anthrax toxin entry pathway to prevent apoptosis. We have recently found that overexpression of Bcl-XL or ΔBcl-XL inhibits Bad phosphorylation at serine 136.2 We determined one cellular activity of LFn-ΔBcl-XL by examining the effect of LFn-ΔBcl-XL on this phosphorylation of Bad. As shown in Fig.5, LFn-ΔBcl-XL protein, like transfection with Bcl-XL and ΔBcl-XL, effectively blocks Bad phosphorylation. This is consistent with a cytosolic delivery of Bcl-XL by LFn and demonstrates one similar cytosolic bioactivity between LFn-ΔBcl-XL protein and endogenous overexpression of Bcl-XL or Bcl-XL lacking the C terminus. This new strategy to block cell death was explored in an animal model of neuronal apoptosis. Neonatal rat retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) die by apoptosis within 24 h after optic nerve section (3Rabachi S. Bonfanti L. Liu X.H. Maffei L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5292-5301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Retinal ganglion cells were axotomized, and within 5 min a protein mixture containing 0.35 μg of PA and 0.65 μg of LFn-ΔBcl-XL was injected into the ipsilateral eye. Control mice were not axotomized, axotomized and injected with PBS, or axotomized and injected with LFn-ΔBcl-XL alone or PA alone. Mice were sacrificed 24 h later, and the eyes were examined histologically. As seen in Fig.6 A, a great number of pyknotic cells, i.e. apoptotic cells (3Rabachi S. Bonfanti L. Liu X.H. Maffei L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5292-5301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were found in the retinal ganglion cell layer 24 h after axotomy. However, when eyes were injected with LFn-ΔBcl-XL and PA, much of the cell death was inhibited (Fig. 6 A). LFn-ΔBcl-XL alone or PA alone caused no obvious prevention of cell death. To quantitate the extent of cell death, the living and pyknotic cells in the entire retinal ganglion cell layers of three sections from one eye in each of 4–10 mice/group were counted. The results are shown in Fig. 6 B. LFn-ΔBcl-XL plus PA inhibited more than half of the cell death caused by neuronal axotomy in vivo (p < 0.001), whereas PA alone or LFn-ΔBcl-XL alone had no significant effect. Bcl-XL engineered to enter cells from the extracellular milieu inhibits neuron death in vitro and in vivo.

For example, overexpression of abcl-2 transgene increases RGC survival after axotomy in neonatal mice (27Bonfanti L. Strettoi E. Chierzi S. Cenni M.C. Liu X.H. Martinou J.-C. Maffei L. Rabacchi S.A.

Martinou J.-C. Tonegawa S. Nature. 1997; 385: 434-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Some animal models of stroke show a benefit derived from Bcl-XL or Bcl-2 transgenic overexpression (26Martinou J.-C. Dubois-Dauphin M. Staple J.K. Rodriguez I. Frankowski H. Missotten M. Albertini P.

Lett. 1999; 268: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Bcl-2 by viral gene transfer also reduces infarction after permanent and transient focal ischemia (59Linnik M.D. Zahos P. Geschwind M.D. Federoff H.J. Stroke. 1995; 26: 1670-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 60Lawrence M.S. Ho D.Y. Sun G.H. Steiberg G.K. Sapolsky R.M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 486-496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several disease models also show benefit derived from Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL overexpression. Bcl-2 prolongs life in a mouse model of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (54Kostic V. Jackson-Lewis V. de Bilbao F. Dubois-Dauphin M. Przedborski S. Science. 1997; 277: 559-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) and protects photoreceptor cells in different retinal degeneration models (61Chen J. Flannery J.G. LaVail M.M. Steinberg R.H. Xu J. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7042-7047Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 62Nir I. Kedzierski W. Chen J. Travis G.H. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2150-2154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, transgenic or viral-transduced overexpression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL appears to have a broad ability to prevent neuronal death. Although delivery of the gene for Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL is not now clinically practical, methods of delivering protein to the central nervous system via direct infusion into the brain, cerebrospinal fluid, spinal cord, or peripheral nerves have been established in animals (63Lonser R.R. Gogate N. Morrison P.F. Wood J.D. Oldfield E.H. J. Neurosurg. 1998; 89: 616-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 64Bobo R.H. Laske D.W. Akbasak A. Morrison P.F. Dedrick R.L. Oldfield E.H.

Neurobiol. 1999; 57: 451-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 66Laske D.W. Youle R.J. Oldfield E.H. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1362-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Thus, delivery of proteins that prevent apoptosis may inhibit certain neurodegenerative conditions. Here, we demonstrate that a single intravitreal administration of both LFn-ΔBcl-XL and PA prevents 60% of the apoptosis induced by optic nerve section in the RGC layer of neonatal rats. Because only one concentration and single dose injection of both LFn-ΔBcl-XL and PA have been tested in the present study, it is possible that a higher apoptosis-preventing effect could be achieved using increased protein dosage or increasing injection frequency. It has been demonstrated that some neurotrophic factors promote the survival of neurons in vivo (67Horner P.J. Gage F. Nature. 2000; 407: 963-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar), but the clinical utility of neurotrophic factors thus far has not been dramatic. Nerve growth factor was confirmed to have therapeutic effects only on some sensory neuropathies (68Apfel S.C. Kessler J.A. Adornato B.T. Litchy W.J. Sanders C. Rask C.A.

Neurology. 2000; 54 (; Erratum (2000) Neurology55, 162): 1080-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Brain-derived neurotrophic factor in ALS patients had no effect on survival but exhibited a statistically significant benefit for those ALS patients with early respiratory impairment and altered bowel function (70The BDNF Study Group Neurology. 1999; 52: 1427-1433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ciliary neurotrophic factor exhibited mostly negative effects in ALS patients (71Miller R.G. Petajan J.H. Bryan W.W. Armon C. Barohn R.J. Goodpasture J.C. Hoagland R.J. Parry G.J. Ross M.A. Stromatt S.C. Ann. Neurol. 1996; 39: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Direct delivery of LFn-ΔBcl-XL may have an advantage over neurotrophic factors to increase neuron survival. In the nervous system, various neurotrophic factors protect different subsets of neurons only during certain developmental periods. For example, nerve growth factor maintains the survival of sympathetic neurons only during neonatal maturation. Because Bcl-XL is widely expressed in the central nervous system during development (20Gonzalez-Garcia M. Perez-Ballestero R. Ding L. Duan L. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Nunez G. Development. 1994; 120: 3033-3042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and its overexpression protects against a broad range of neurotoxic insults (32Parsadanian A.S. Cheng Y. Keller-Peck C.R. Holtzman D.M. Snider W.D. Neuron. 1998; 18: 1009-1019Google Scholar, 33Wiessner C. Allegrini P.R. Rupalla K. Sauer D. Oltersdorf T. McGregor A.L. Bischoff S. Bottiger B.W. van der Putten H. Neurosci.

A. 1998; 95: 2603-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), LFn-ΔBcl-XL may have broad potential to prevent apoptosis of different types of neurons resulting from different insults at different stages of development. Here we show LFn-ΔBcl-XL protects cerebellar granule cells, a macrophage-related cell line, and retinal ganglion cells from apoptosis. Previously, we found Bcl-XL-DTR prevents apoptosis caused by poliovirus, radiation, and STS (34Liu X.-H. Castelli J. Youle R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9563-9567Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The finding that the combination of LFn-ΔBcl-XL and PA dramatically inhibits apoptosis in the J774 macrophage cell line also indicates that the fusion protein can be successfully delivered to non-neuronal cell lines to block cell death. Thus, a large number of uses outside the nervous system may also be considered as potential applications of Bcl-XL protein delivery.

It has been demonstrated further that CDK9 phosphorylation is required for high affinity binding of Tat/P-TEFb to the TAR RNA structure and that the state of P-TEFb phosphorylation may regulate Tat transactivation. We now demonstrate that CDK9 phosphorylation is uniquely regulated in the HIV-1 preinitiation and elongation complexes. The presence of TFIIH in the HIV-1 preinitiation complex inhibits CDK9 phosphorylation. As TFIIH is released from the elongation complex between +14 and +36, CDK9 phosphorylation is observed. In contrast to the activity in the “soluble” complex, phosphorylation of CDK9 is increased by the presence of Tat in the transcription complexes. Consistent with these observations, we have demonstrated that purified TFIIH directly inhibits CDK9 autophosphorylation. By using recombinant TFIIH subcomplexes, our results suggest that the XPB subunit of TFIIH is responsible for this inhibition of CDK9 phosphorylation. Interestingly, our results further suggest that the phosphorylated form of CDK9 is the active kinase for RNA polymerase II carboxyl-terminal domain phosphorylation.

Second, dominant-negative mutants of CDK9 or kinase inhibitors that preferentially block CDK9 inhibit Tat transactivation and HIV-1 replication in vivo (14Gold M.O. Yang X. Herrmann C.H. Rice A.P. J.

The function of the Tat·P-TEFb complex is mediated through the high affinity, loop-specific binding of the Tat·P-TEFb complex to the TAR RNA structure.

Recent studies have reported that autophosphorylation of CDK9 regulates this high affinity binding of the Tat·P-TEFb complex to TAR RNA structure (40Garber M.E. Mayall T.P. Suess E.M. Meisenhelder J.

Biol. 2000; 20: 5897-5907Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Genetic studies have shown that TAR can be functionally replaced by heterologous RNA structures. The subsequent recruitment of Tat to these RNA targets by fusion of Tat to an RNA binding domain can clearly fully activate HIV-1 LTR-dependent transcription (42Selby M.J. Peterlin B.M. Cell. 1990; 62: 769-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 43Tiley L.S. Madore S.J. Malim M.H. Cullen B.R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2077-2087Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, chimeric CycT1 or CDK9 proteins can also activate transcription if tethered directly to nascent RNA (14Gold M.O. Yang X. Herrmann C.H. Rice A.P. J.

The second CTD kinase that has been implicated in Tat transactivation is TFIIH, a general transcription factor that contains nine polypeptides (ERCC3/XPB, ERCC2/XPD, p62, p52, p44, CDK7 (MO15), cyclin H, MAT1, and p34) (44Drapkin R.

In association with cyclin H and MAT1, CDK7 forms the CDK-activating kinase (CAK) complex that phosphorylates CDKs involved in the regulation of the cell cycle (52Harper J.W. Elledge S.J.

The association of CAK with core TFIIH switches its substrate specificity from CDKs to the CTD of RNAP II (57Rossignol M. Kolb-Cheynel I. Egly J.M.

Interestingly, the yeast homologue of CDK7, Kin28, is found only in a complex with TFIIH and is devoid of CAK activity (59Cismowski M.J. Laff G.M. Solomon M.J. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2983-2992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although it has been reported that Tat enhances CDK7 kinase activity (8Parada C.A. Roeder R.G.

Biol. 1999; 19: 2863-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that CDK7 (TFIIH) and CDK9 (P-TEFb) associate with the HIV-1 preinitiation complex (63Zhou M. Halanski M.A. Radonovich M.F. Kashanchi F. Peng J. Price D.H. Brady J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5077-5086Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 64Ping Y.H. Rana T.M. J. Biol.

Furthermore, our previous published results (63Zhou M. Halanski M.A. Radonovich M.F. Kashanchi F. Peng J. Price D.H. Brady J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5077-5086Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) also demonstrated that CDK7 phosphorylates RNAP II CTD at serine 5 and CDK9 phosphorylates CTD at serine 2 during HIV-1 transcription. Thus, it is important to understand the relationship between CDK7 (TFIIH) and CDK9 (P-TEFb) during Tat transactivation. The recent reports (40Garber M.E. Mayall T.P. Suess E.M. Meisenhelder J. Thompson N.E. Jones K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6958-6969Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 41Fong Y.W. Zhou Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5897-5907Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that CDK9 autophosphorylation is important for binding to TAR RNA structure. The results presented in this study indicate that TFIIH plays a significant role in regulating CDK9 phosphorylation and thus Tat·P-TEFb binding to the TAR RNA structure. TFIIH apparently inhibits CDK9 phosphorylation until it is released from the transcription complex between +14 and +36. Once TFIIH is released, CDK9 phosphorylation occurs, allowing the Tat·P-TEFb complex to bind to the newly synthesized TAR RNA structure and facilitate transcription elongation. The orchestrated release of TFIIH and induction of Tat·P-TEFb binding to the TAR RNA structure almost certainly contributes to the normal efficiency of HIV-1 transcription in infected cells. Anti-TBP and anti-TFIIB monoclonal antibodies were bought from Promega. Anti-TFIIEα, anti-RAP74, anti-p62 (a subunit of TFIIH), anti-CDK7, and anti-Sp1 antibodies are products of Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-CDK9 antibody was purchased from Biodesign Co. Anti-CTD of RNAP II monoclonal antibodies 8WG16, H5 (phosphoserine 2) and H14 (phosphoserine 5), and anti-Tat monoclonal antibody are products of Babco. HIV-1 LTR templates (nucleotides −110 to +168) were amplified by PCR with the forward primer 5′-biotinylated TAT GGA TTT ACA AGG GAC TTT C-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GAT CCG ATT ACT AAA AGG G-3′. The primers were synthesized and biotinylated by Lofstrand Laboratories. The production of recombinant P-TEFb proteins was carried out as described by Penget al. (18Peng J. Zhu Y. Milton J.T. Price D.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 755-762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TFIIH and TFIID were purified from HeLa extracts (67Imhof A. Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nakatani Y. Wolffe A.P. Ge H. Curr.

Egly J.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 87-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). HeLa nuclear extract (100 μl) in 0.8 m KCl buffer D (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 15% glycerol, 800 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm DTT) was incubated with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads to which anti-CDK7 had been pre-bound (10 μg of IgG). Antigen-antibody complexes were removed by centrifugation. After repeating the procedure twice, depleted nuclear extracts were dialyzed against 0.1 m KCl buffer D and assayed by Western blot analysis. Association reaction mixtures (30 μl) contained 15 μl of HeLa nuclear extract, 1.0 μg of biotinylated templates, and 1.0 μg of poly(dI-dC) in the absence or presence of Tat. The in vitro transcription (IVT) buffer contained 50 mm KCl, 6.25 mmMgCl2, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 2 mmDTT, 0.5 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 10 μmZnSO4, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 100 μg/ml creatine kinase, and 8.5% glycerol (1× IVT buffer). After a 30-min incubation at 30 °C, streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynabeads, Dynal) pre-equilibrated in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 80 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 10 μm ZnSO4, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol) were then added to the reactions, and the mixtures were further incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The immobilized templates were then harvested using a magnetic stand, and the PICs were washed extensively with 1× IVT buffer. In vitro transcription and Western blot analysis could be performed using the purified PICs assembled on the immobilized templates. The purified PICs assembled on the immobilized templates were heated for 10 min at 100 °C in SDS loading buffer. The released proteins were fractionated by electrophoresis on 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then transblotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore). The protein components of PICs were analyzed with specific antibodies as indicated above. In vitro transcription reactions (100 μl) were set up by resuspending the purified PICs in 100 μl of 1× IVT buffer, 50 μm ATP, 50 μm CTP, 50 μm GTP, 20 μCi of [α-32P]UTP, and 10 units of RNasin (Promega). The transcription reactions were allowed to take place for 60 min at 30 °C. The radiolabeled transcripts were fractionated by electrophoresis on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and detected by PhosphorImager. Kinase reactions were performed by mixing the purified PICs with 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 100 μl of 1× IVT buffer. After an incubation of 10 min at 30 °C, the PICs were separated from supernatants and washed extensively. 500 μl of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) was then added into the tubes containing PICs immobilized by streptavidin-coated beads, and the mixtures were incubated for 120 min at 4 °C with rocking. The supernatants were saved, and phosphorylated proteins were immunoprecipitated by specific antibodies. The purified PICs were incubated with ATP for 10 min and then washed extensively with 1× IVT buffer. The PICs were walked to position U-14 by incubation with 50 μm dATP, CTP, GTP, and UTP for 10 min at 30 °C and then washed extensively with 1× IVT buffer. The transcriptional elongation complexes (TECs) stalled at U-14 were walked stepwise along the DNA by repeated incubation with different sets of three NTPs, and then washed extensively with 1× IVT buffer to remove the unincorporated NTPs. To detect phosphorylation of proteins during moves, phosphorylated proteins were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP during stepwise moves. To analyze the proteins components of TECs stalled, the TECs were walked with cold NTPs, and TECs stalled at different positions were then analyzed by Western blots. CDK9 autophosphorylation assays were performed by mixing 50 ng of P-TEFb, 10 μmATP, and 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in the absence or presence of Tat and incubating for 60 min at 23 °C. The total reaction volume was 20 μl, and the final conditions were 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm DTT, 5 mm MnCl2, 4 mm MgCl2, and 10 μm ZnSO4. Phosphorylated CDK9 was then immunoprecipitated with anti-CDK9 antibody and fractionated by electrophoresis on 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. CTD kinase assays were performed by mixing 100 ng of GST-CTD, 50 ng of P-TEFb, 200 μm ATP and incubating for 60 min at 23 °C. The total reaction volume was 20 μl, and the final conditions were 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm DTT, 5 mm MnCl2, 4 mm MgCl2, and 10 μmZnSO4. Others proteins were added as indicated in the figure legends. We recently developed an immobilized template assay to analyze Tat transactivation (63Zhou M. Halanski M.A. Radonovich M.F. Kashanchi F. Peng J. Price D.H. Brady J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5077-5086Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 70Zhou M. Kashanchi F. Jiang H. Ge H. Brady J.N. Virology. 2000; 268: 452-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, HIV-1 LTR promoter templates were 5′ end-labeled with biotin at position −110 and incubated with HeLa nuclear extracts. PICs were subsequently purified with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads and analyzed by Western blots (Fig.1 A). Nonspecific DNA (poly[dI-dC]) was included during the incubation of templates with HeLa nuclear extract to minimize nonspecific binding of protein to the DNA template. Parallel binding reactions were also carried out with a biotinylated TATA box mutant template of the HIV-1 LTR as a negative control for nonspecific binding of protein to templates. Finally, the magnetic beads used to purify the templates were extensively blocked with bovine serum albumin to minimize background binding of proteins to the beads, thus interfering with Western blot analysis. The results shown in Fig. 1 A demonstrate several important points. First, consistent with previous reports (63Zhou M. Halanski M.A. Radonovich M.F. Kashanchi F. Peng J. Price D.H. Brady J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5077-5086Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 65Garcia-Martinez L.F. Ivanov D. Gaynor R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6951-6958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), Tat is a component of the HIV-1 PICs (9th panel). Second, RNAP II and general transcription factors including TFIID, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH associate with HIV-1 PICs (lanes 3 and 4). Tat does not affect the level of association of RNAP II and general transcription factors with PICs (lanes 3 and 4). Third, both CDK7 and CDK9, the two kinases responsible for RNAP II CTD phosphorylation during HIV-1 transcription, are present in the HIV-1 PICs (7th and 8th panels). Interestingly, the amount of either kinase is equal in the absence or presence of Tat with the wild-type HIV-1 LTR template (lanes 3 and 4). The appearance of proteins bound to the templates is specific. Parallel assays performed with a TATA box mutant HIV-1 LTR, which is transcriptionally inactive, failed to precipitate RNAP II and general transcription factors (lanes 1 and 2). Importantly, the presence of the TATA box mutation did not affect Sp-1 binding to the template (Fig. 1 A,"

A Rho-type small GTP-binding protein (Rho1p) in the budding yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae has been shown to play a pivotal role in cell morphogenesis by regulating its effector proteins. Rho1p binds and activates Fks1p and Fks2p, two closely related catalytic subunits of 1,3-β-glucan synthase (GS),1 thereby directly controlling cell wall synthesis (1Drgonová J. Drgon T. Tanaka K.

Gene disruption analyses revealed that among the five Rho1p effector proteins, Fks1/2p and Pkc1p are the most important in yeast cell growth. Δfks1Δfks2 and Δpkc1 are both lethal in complete medium (11Levin D.E. Fields F.O. Kunisawa R. Bishop J.M. Thorner J.

Thus, Rho1p controls cell morphogenesis by regulating the activities of two essential effector proteins important for cell wall synthesis and actin cytoskeleton organization. Several conditional lethal mutations (high temperature-sensitive mutations) in the RHO1 gene (rho1-2,rho1-3, rho1-4, rho1-5) have been isolated in our laboratory and characterized for elucidation of Rho1p function. Biochemical analyses of the rho1 mutants greatly contributed to the understanding of the essential pathways downstream of Rho1p (2Qadota H. Python C.P. Inoue S.B. Arisawa M. Anraku Y. Zheng Y.

Schmidt A. Ohya Y. Hall M.N. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1211-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that actin morphologies differ among therho1 mutants: rho1-3 and rho1-4display normal polarized actin patches, whereas rho1-2 andrho1-5 possess delocalized actin patches. In this study, we investigated what kind of phenotypic differences exist among therho1 mutants and why. We found that two groups ofrho1 mutations show “intragenic complementation.” Based on characterizations of the complementing rho1 mutations in terms of activation of each Rho1p effector protein, the mechanism of intragenic complementation is discussed in conjunction with multifunctional properties of Rho1p. Standard procedures were used for DNA manipulations and Escherichia coli transformation (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The E. coli strain SCS1 (Stratagene, San Diego, CA) was used for propagation of the plasmids used in this study (Table I). TheS. cerevisiae strains used are listed in TableII. All strains except Δpkc1/stt1 are isogenic derivatives of YPH499 and YPH500. Yeast transformation was carried out using the lithium acetate method (17Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic manipulations for yeast were carried out as described (18Kaiser C.S. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual.

Yeast cells were grown either in rich medium (YPD; 1% Bacto-yeast extract (Difco), 2% Bacto-peptone (Difco), and 2% glucose (Wako Chemicals, Osaka, Japan)) or in synthetic growth medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base (Difco) and 2% glucose) supplemented appropriately.Table IPlasmids used in this workNameParent plasmidMarkersRef.pRS314TRP1,CEN39Sikorski R.S.

Open table in a new tab To isolate temperature-sensitive rho1 mutants, we introduced random mutations into the entire region of RHO1 by the error-prone polymerase chain reaction method (19Cadwell R.C. Joyce G.F. PCR Methods Applications. 1992; 2: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). The RHO1 open reading frame was amplified by AmpliTaq polymerase with 5′-ATT AAC CCT CAC TAA AGA GAT CTC TAT AAC AAG ACA CAC TT-3′ and 5′-GGG GGA ATT CAT GTC ACA ACA AGT TG-3′. The amplified polymerase chain reaction fragment was cloned into the EcoRI-BglII site of pYO701. The resulting plasmids were transformed into the YOC706 strain containing pYO774 (YCpUG-RHO1) with the RHO1 gene deleted. Transformants were streaked onto YPD plates and incubated at 23 and 37 °C for screening temperature-sensitive mutants. The resultant candidates were selected on plates containing 5-fluoroorotic acid to eliminate pYO774. After rescue of the mutagenized plasmids, the plasmids were re-transformed into YOC706 and checked for the phenotypes. By scanning common mutations in 39 independently isolatedrho1 mutants, we identified 13 single mutations that may result in a temperature-sensitive phenotype. We then made 13 single mutations by site-directed mutagenesis and examined temperature sensitivity in their growth. Finally, 12 temperature-sensitiverho1 mutations were identified. Integration of the mutant rho1 genes into the chromosomalADE3 locus was performed as follows. Plasmids carrying the temperature-sensitive rho1 mutations were digested withBamHI and SalI, and the resulting fragments containing rho1 were cloned into plasmid pYO743. The resulting plasmids were digested with SacII, and the mutantrho1 genes were integrated into the ADE3 locus (20Ohya Y. Botstein D. Genetics. 1994; 138: 1041-1054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of the diploid strain YOC701 (RHO1/rho1Δ::HIS3). From the resultant strains, haploid rho1 mutants were obtained by tetrad analysis (18Kaiser C.S. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 25 °C in 1 liter medium in a 2-liter flask rotating in an air incubator (Innova 4330) at 150 rpm until A 600 = 1. All the following procedures were carried out at 4 °C, unless otherwise stated. The cells were harvested; washed with 1 mm EDTA; and disrupted by vortexing four times for 2 min each with 5-ml glass beads in 20 ml of breaking solution containing 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After centrifugation at 1500 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was collected and transferred to 33 PC tubes (Hitachi). The membrane fraction was collected by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 30 min in an RP70T rotor (Hitachi) with Himac CP 65β (Hitachi). The resultant pellet was suspended with membrane buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 33% glycerol and homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer. The GS activity of the membrane fraction was measured according to a previously described procedure (21Inoue S.B. Takewaki N. Takasuka T. Mio T. Adachi M. Fujii Y. Miyamoto C. Arisawa M. Furuichi Y. Watanabe T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 845-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). As described (21Inoue S.B. Takewaki N. Takasuka T. Mio T. Adachi M. Fujii Y. Miyamoto C. Arisawa M. Furuichi Y. Watanabe T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 845-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), the assay buffer contained an excess amount of GTPγS. Cells were cultured to log phase at 25 °C in YPD medium and shifted to 37 °C for 2 h. Cell extracts were prepared as described (22Martı́n H. Rodrı́guez-Pachón J.M. Ruiz C. Nombela C. Molina M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1511-1519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Protein samples (50 μg) were loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, catalog no. RPN2020F), and blotted with either an anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK(Thr202/Tyr204) antibody (New England Biolabs Inc., catalog no. 9101) or an anti-MAPK antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog no. sc-6802). Yeast cells were incubated on a YPD plate at 25 °C for 2 days and shifted to 37 °C overnight. The plate was then overlaid with an alkaline phosphatase assay solution as described by Paravicini et al. (3Paravicini G. Cooper M. Friedli L. Smith D.J. Carpentier J.-L. Klig L.S. Payton M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4896-4905Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Colonies containing lysed cells turned blue within 1 h, whereas control colonies remained unstained, even after 2 h. Actin staining with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene OR) was carried out as described (23Pringle J.R. Peterson R.A. Adams A.E.M. Sterns T. Drubin D.G. Haarer B.K. Jones E.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 31: 357-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Cells were observed with a Leica Model DMRE microscope fitted with HCX PLA PLAPO. Images were captured using a CCD camera (Loper MicroMax/OL) and Metamorph Imaging software (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA). All images presented were processed using Adobe Photoshop software. To understand the cellular functions of Rho1p, we systematically generated temperature-sensitiverho1 mutants. Random mutations were introduced into theRHO1 gene using error-prone polymerase chain reaction (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig.1, we finally identified 12 temperature-sensitive rho1 mutations. Sequencing of these mutants revealed that all of the substituted amino acids were those conserved in mammalian RhoA protein. Especially the mutation sites of rho1-2 and rho1-10 were located in the switch 1 and switch 2 regions conserved in the Ras-related proteins. These regions are also collectively called the “putative effector recognition domain” (24Marshall M.S. Davis L.J. Keys R.D. Mosser S.D. Hill W.S. Scolnick E.M. Gibbs J.B. Mol. Cell.

Science. 1991; 254: 1342-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). By reciprocal mating between strains carrying 12 different rho1 mutations, we constructed diploid strains and checked their temperature sensitivity (Fig.2). All diploid strains homozygous for the temperature-sensitive alleles (e.g. rho1-2/rho1-2) failed to grow at the restrictive temperature. On some occasions, diploid cells bearing different recessive alleles (heteroallelic diploids) were able to grow at the restrictive temperature. For example, rho1-2/rho1-4 (a heteroallelic diploid) grew well at 37 °C, althoughrho1-2/rho1-2 and rho1-4/rho1-4 (homoallelic diploids) did not. This occasional phenomenon is called intragenic complementation. The pattern of growth at the restrictive temperature for all combinations of the rho1alleles revealed two intragenic complementation groups of therho1 mutations. The rho1A group consisted of therho1-2 and rho1-5 mutants, whereas therho1B group included the rho1-3,rho1-4, rho1-10, and rho1-11 mutants. In all combinations between mutant alleles of the rho1A andrho1B groups, intragenic complementation was observed (TableIII). The rest of the mutants were not classifiable in either group. These results indicated that Rho1p has at least two different essential functions, one of which is abolished in the rho1A group mutants, and the other in therho1B group mutants.Table IIIGroup and alleleMutationrho1A rho1-2E45V rho1-5G121Crho1B rho1-3L60P rho1-4W104R rho1-10D70G/S165P rho1-11E102K/K167E Open table in a new tab The membrane fraction was prepared from each group ofrho1 mutant cells grown at 25 °C and was either kept at the same temperature or shifted to 37 °C. We found that all of therho1 mutant strains had less GS activity than the wild-type strain under both conditions (Fig.3 A). The reduced GS activity is not due to the failure to activate the Pkc1p-MAPK cascade because a Δpkc1 mutant exhibits no less GS activity than the wild-type strain (2Qadota H. Python C.P. Inoue S.B. Arisawa M. Anraku Y. Zheng Y. Watanabe T. Levin D.E. Ohya Y. Science. 1996; 272: 279-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the rho1B group mutants exhibited significantly lower GS activity than therho1A group mutants under both conditions. Failure to observe temperature-sensitive GS activities in Fig.3 A may represent reversible inactivation of the mutant proteins at the restrictive temperature (28Drgonová J. Drgon T. Roh D.-H. Cabib E. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 373-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To clarify this point, we isolated the membrane fractions from the rho1 mutants grown at 25 °C and measured their GS activities at both 25 and 35 °C. We found that all of the rho1B group mutants exhibited temperature sensitivity for the in vitro GS activities, whereas the rho1A group mutants did not (Fig.3 B). We also measured GS activity in the membrane fractions of homoallelic (rho1-2/rho1-2 and rho1-4/rho1-4) and heteroallelic (rho1-2/rho1-4) diploid cells. Under both conditions, the GS activities in the homoallelicrho1-2/rho1-2 and rho1-4/rho1-4 diploid cells were essentially the same as those in the corresponding haploid mutants (Fig. 3 C). In heteroallelic rho1-2/rho1-4 cells, the in vitro GS activity was enhanced compared with that inrho1-4/rho1-4 diploid cells, irrespective of the assay conditions used. To evaluate activation of the Pkc1p-MAPK cascade in the complementing rho1 mutant groups, we attempted to detect induced signaling through the Pkc1p-Mpk1p pathway in therho1 mutants. Pkc1p activates the MAPK cascade composed of Bck1p (MAPK kinase kinase), Mkk1/2p (MAPK kinase), and Mpk1p/Slt2p (MAPK) (29Lee K.G. Levin D.E. Mol. Cell.

Under physiological conditions, tyrosine/threonine phosphorylation of Mpk1p is known to be induced by shifting the growth temperature from 23 to 37–39 °C (33Kamada Y. Jung U.S. Piotrowski J. Levin D.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1559-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 34Zarzov P. Mazzoni C. Mann C. EMBO J. 1996; 2: 83-91Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was performed after a heat shock treatment using antibodies that specifically recognize Mpk1p or phosphorylated Mpk1p (Fig.4 A). Comparison of the Mpk1p levels revealed no essential difference between the wild-type strain and any of the rho1 mutants. However, upon heat treatment, phosphorylated Mpk1p was induced in rho1A group cells apparently to a lesser extent than in wild-type cells. On the other hand, the rho1B group exhibited no defect in heat shock-induced Mpk1p phosphorylation. These results indicate that mutants in the rho1A group are defective in activation of the Pkc1p-Mpk1p pathway. We also examined the levels of phosphorylated Mpk1p in homoallelic (rho1-5/rho1-5 and rho1-10/rho1-10) and heteroallelic (rho1-5/rho1-10) diploid cells upon heat shock (Fig. 4 B). Homoallelic rho1-5/rho1-5 andrho1-10/rho1-10 diploid cells contained the same level of phosphorylated Mpk1p as the cells of the corresponding haploid strains. In contrast, heteroallelic rho1-5/rho1-10 diploid cells contained an increased level of phosphorylated Mpk1p compared with cells of the severely affected rho1A group mutants (rho1-5/rho1-5). Biochemical analyses of the complementing rho1mutants mentioned above demonstrated that mutations in therho1A and rho1B groups result in decreased Pkc1p activation and lowered GS activity, respectively. To determine whether other phenotypic differences exist between the rho1A and therho1B groups, cytological characterization and phenotypic analysis of the complementing rho1 mutant groups were performed. It is well known that mutants with defects in the Pkc1p-Mpk1p pathway display both actin delocalization and cell lysis phenotypes (3Paravicini G. Cooper M. Friedli L. Smith D.J. Carpentier J.-L.

Therefore, actin localization and cell lysis phenotypes were analyzed in rho1, Δpkc1, and temperature-sensitive GS mutants. Actin morphology was examined in rho1 and other mutant cells incubated for 5 h after being shifted from 25 to 37 °C and then stained with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin. As shown in Fig.5 A, cells of therho1B group and the fks1-1125 mutants as well as those of the wild-type control displayed normal localization of actin patches at the growing cell surface. Conversely, the rho1Agroup, Δpkc1, and the fks1-1154 mutants exhibited delocalized actin patches at the restrictive temperature. Additionally, the rho1A group and Δpkc1displayed cell enlargement. We also examined actin morphology in homoallelic (rho1-2/rho1-2, rho1-4/rho1-4,rho1-5/rho1-5, and rho1-10/rho1-10) and heteroallelic (rho1-2/rho1-4 and rho1-5/rho1-10) diploid cells at the restrictive temperature (Fig. 5 B). Therho1A group homoallelic diploid cells (rho1-2/rho1-2 and rho1-5/rho1-5) exhibited essentially the same defects in actin morphology as the corresponding haploid cells. In contrast, the heteroallelic diploid cells (rho1-2/rho1-4 and rho1-5/rho1-10) exhibited normal actin localization. To directly examine the cell lysis phenotype of rho1 and other mutants, we carried out a simple plate overlay assay, in which leakage of alkaline phosphatase from cells is detected (3Paravicini G. Cooper M. Friedli L. Smith D.J. Carpentier J.-L. Klig L.S. Payton M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4896-4905Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). As positive controls, the mutant strains of Δpkc1/stt1 andrho1-5, which were previously reported to result in cell lysis, were employed (5Kamada Y. Qadota H. Python C.P. Anraku Y. Ohya Y. Levin D.E.

A. 1994; 91: 9317-9321Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), whereas as negative controls, the wild-type strain and the rho1-3 mutant (5Kamada Y. Qadota H. Python C.P. Anraku Y. Ohya Y. Levin D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9193-9196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) were used. Fig.6 shows that the rho1A group, Δpkc1, and fks1-1154 mutant cells resulted in cell lysis, whereas the wild-type, rho1B group, andfks1-1125 mutant cells did not. Taking this into account, we conclude that the rho1A and rho1B group mutants exhibit phenotypes similar to those of mutants of Pkc1p (Δpkc1) and GS (fks1-1125), respectively. Intragenic complementation is sometimes observed among mutations in a multifunctional gene. For example, the yeast His4 protein is a multifunctional protein catalyzing three different enzymatic steps in histidine biosynthesis, and a mutation in this protein affects only one of them (37Fink G.R. Genetics. 1966; 53: 445-459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our intragenic complementation results are compatible with this view, although Rho1p may not be as easily separable into structural domains as the His4 product. Of the alternative mechanisms that might account for intragenic complementation, those that involve interactions of identical subunits seem unlikely since yeast Rho1p is thought to be present in vivo as a monomer. The results of the intragenic complementation analyses enable us to classify rho1 mutants into three groups: therho1A group (rho1-2 and rho1-5), therho1B group (rho1-3, rho1-4,rho1-10, and rho1-11), and the rest. An intragenic complementation study of calmodulin mutations showed that particular Phe residues can be related to several diverse calmodulin functions (38Ohya Y. Botstein D. Science. 1994; 263: 963-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The fact that Rho1p regulates two essential effectors, Fks1/2p and Pkc1p, suggests that the functions of this protein may also be borne by groups of residues that complement each other. We thus examined whether each of the essential Rho1p functions was abolished in the rho1A or rho1B group mutations. Measurement of two essential downstream activities of Rho1p demonstrated that therho1A group lacks the ability to activate the Pkc1p-Mpk1p pathway and that the rho1B group has severe defects in GS activation. The failure of each mutant group to activate each downstream pathway was consistent with phenotypic differences of the group mutants; the rho1A group mutants showed close phenotypic resemblance to Δpkc1, whereas therho1B group mutants exhibited phenotypic similarity tofks1-1125. Finally, examinations of homoallelic and heteroallelic diploids with rho1 mutations revealed mutual complementation of the effector lesions caused by mutations in therho1A and rho1B groups. Taking all these observations together, we consider it most likely that the intragenic complementation of the rho1 mutations is ascribable to complementation of decreased effector activities downstream of Rho1p (Fig. 7). This study presents the first biochemical evidence showing the mechanism of intragenic complementation observed in mutations in the RHO1 gene. One of the possible mechanisms underlying the inability of complementing rho1 mutants to activate Pkc1p or GS is that the mutant proteins cannot physically interact with Pkc1p or GS. Indeed, we observed that rho1-2, which belongs to therho1A group showing a defect in Pkc1p activation, compromised an interaction between Pkc1p and the GTP-bound form of Rho1p when detected by a two-hybrid assay. However, rho1-5, which also belongs to the rho1A group, did not affect the two-hybrid interaction (data not shown), suggesting that therho1-5 mutation compromises Pkc1p activation without affecting interaction. Similarly, rho1-3, which belongs to the rho1B group, abrogated GS activation without affecting the interaction with GS because GS purified from the rho1-3mutant contained the same amount of Rho1p as the wild-type strain (data not shown). We speculate that the mutant protein (Rho1-5p or Rho1-3p) cannot induce the conformational change in effector enzymes that is required for their activation. The three-dimensional structure of the active form of the human RhoA protein has been solved (14Ihara K. Muraguchi S. Kato M. Shimizu T. Shirakawa M. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K. Hakoshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9656-9666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Based on the high sequence identity (72%) between the human RhoA protein and yeast Rho1p, it seemed appropriate to map Rho1p mutation points onto the structural model of the human RhoA protein. Mutations belonging to the same complementation group were not mapped in a specific region on the RhoA protein structure, suggesting that some mutated amino acids influence the activation of effector proteins indirectly by perturbing the global structure of Rho1p itself (data not shown). However, we found that Glu45 (rho1-2) and Lys167(rho1-11) were mapped on the surface of the RhoA protein, with their residues exposed to the outside. Since alteration of such amino acid residues would not affect the global protein structure, they are considered to be directly involved in the recognition of effector proteins. Indeed, they are located within or near the switch 1 and switch 2 regions that are reported to be important for association of the Rho-type GTPase with its effectors (14Ihara K. Muraguchi S. Kato M. Shimizu T. Shirakawa M. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K. Hakoshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9656-9666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Because therho1-2 and rho1-11 mutations abolished the activation of Pkc1p and GS, respectively, Glu45 and Lys167 might be involved in the specificity of effector recognition. This study provides a clue to understanding the multifunctional properties of Rho1p at the amino acid sequence level. For further study, it will be effective to systematically generate a number ofrho1 mutants that have substitutions at Glu45 or Lys167 and to test their allele-specific ability to activate the effector proteins. Any amino acids located near Glu45 or Lys167 in the three-dimensional structure will also be targeted. We expect that investigations on the structure and functions of a multifunctional protein like Rho1p will help to establish a new concept of the signal transduction network in living cells.

The breakdown of ECM is essential in blastocyst implantation and embryonic development, tissue morphogenesis, menstrual shedding, bone formation, tissue resorption after delivery, and tumor growth and invasion. TGF-β family members are one of the classes of proteins that actively participate in the homeostasis of ECM. Here, we report on the effect of lefty, a novel member of the TGF-β family, on the homeostasis of extracellular matrix in a fibrosarcoma model. Fibroblastic cells forced to expresslefty by retroviral transduction lost their ability to deposit collagen in vivo. This event was associated with down-regulation of the steady-state level of connective tissue growth factor that induces collagen type I mRNA. In addition,lefty transduction significantly decreased collagen type I mRNA expression and simultaneously increased collagenolytic, gelatinolytic, elastolytic, and caseinolytic activities in vivo by the transduced fibroblasts. These findings provide a new insight on the actions of lefty and suggest that this cytokine plays an active role in remodeling of the extracellular matrix in vivo.

Generally, in normal tissues, a balance is reached between the formation and destruction of extracellular matrices (ECMs),1 leading to a state of homeostasis. Acceleration of formation of ECM is a necessary event in some conditions, such as healing of wounds, repair of endometrium after menstruation, and embryonic development. In other physiologic conditions such as tissue breakdown in menstruating endometrium, endometrial tissue invasion by blastocyst, uterine tissue resorption after delivery, tissue morphogenesis, and bone resorption, the degradation of extracellular matrices supersedes the formation of stroma. On the other hand, uncontrolled destruction of ECM contributes to tumor invasion, and unabated deposition of ECM occurs in fibrotic conditions such as scleroderma, postsurgical adhesions, cirrhosis, glomerulosclerosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (Hamman-Rich syndrome), keloid, and post-burn scarring. For these reasons, there is a great interest in identifying the full complement of factors that contribute to the remodeling of ECM.The formation and breakdown of ECM requires precisely coordinated and controlled timely expression and activation of cytokines as well as ECM proteins and a host of enzymes that degrade diverse cellular and extracellular matrix proteins. Growth-regulatory cytokines of the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) family are one of the few classes of proteins that provide the necessary signals required in the homeostasis of a fibrovascular stroma (1Clark R.A.

TGF-β is a major profibrogenic cytokine that promotes the proliferation of fibroblasts, enhances CTGF and collagen type I mRNA expression, and suppresses the degradation of extracellular matrices by a dual action that involves down-regulation of the expression of ECM proteases such as 72-kDa gelatinase and stimulation of protease inhibitors such as tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (4Overall C.M.

TGF-β also supports tumor growth and enhances the development of tumor stroma through increased proliferation of fibroblasts and enhancement of ECM deposition in cancers including fibrosarcoma (18Kahari V.M.

We recently described a new function for lefty, a novel member of the TGF-β family, as a potent inhibitor of TGF-β signaling in vitro (21Ulloa L. Tabibzadeh S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21387-21396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Lefty perturbs TGF-β signaling by inhibiting the phosphorylation of Smad2 after activation of the TGF-β receptor. Moreover, lefty inhibits the events that lie downstream from R-Smad phosphorylation including heterodimerization of R-Smads with Smad4, nuclear translocation of R-Smad-Smad4 complex, and downstream gene transcriptional activities. Lefty opposes the effect of TGF-β on the expression of reporter genes for major cell cycle factors p21 and Cdc25. Smad3 and Smad4 both have domains that bind the 5′-TCTGAGAC-3′ termed Smad binding element. Lefty inhibits the TGF-β-induced promoter activity driven by Smad binding element. Moreover, it was recently shown that the expression of CTGF, which mediates the actions of TGF-β and induces proliferation of fibroblasts and collagen synthesis, is driven by Smad3 and Smad4 (22Holmes A. Sa S. Shiwen X. Black C.M. Abraham D.J. Leask A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10594-10601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Lefty is also capable of inhibiting the TGF-β-mediated promoter activity of CTGF. Thus, lefty provides a repressed state of TGF-β-responsive genes and participates in negative modulation of TGF-β signaling by inhibition of phosphorylation of R-Smads (21Ulloa L. Tabibzadeh S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21387-21396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, it can be predicted that lefty might function in a manner opposite to that induced by TGF-β in vivo. As the first step toward understanding the biologic activity of lefty, in this study, we introduced lefty+ fibroblastic tumor cellsin vivo. Our results support the model in which lefty impairs the CTGF and collagen mRNA expression and deposition of collagen and drives degradation of ECM by an increased proteolytic action that is comprised of collagenolytic, gelatinolytic, and elastolytic activities. The overall effect of these activities leads to remodeling and significant shrinkage of extracellular matrix in the stroma.DISCUSSIONLefty is normally expressed in mesenchymal cells and fibroblasts. In the mouse embryo, lefty-1 gene is expressed in mesodermal cells, and in humans, it is highly expressed in endometrial stromal fibroblasts immediately before the shedding of the endometrial tissue (23Kothapalli R. Buyuksal I. Wu S.Q. Chegini N. Tabibzadeh S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2342-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Lefty is expressed at a low level in other tissues such as colon, ovary, testis, and pancreas (46Tabibzadeh S. Kothapalli R. Buyuksal I. Front. Biosci. 1997; 2: 18-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).Lefty is also overexpressed in certain forms of human cancer (46Tabibzadeh S. Kothapalli R. Buyuksal I. Front. Biosci. 1997; 2: 18-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Currently, there is no information about the biological consequences of lefty gene expression in normal or malignant tissues in vivo. In this report, we showed a new function for lefty by stable expression of lefty in fibroblastic tumor cells and analysis of the effect of lefty on deposition of ECM. Introduction of lefty into these tumor-producing cells significantly impaired the formation of ECM in vivo by a dual mechanism of action that involved inhibition of CTGF and collagen mRNA synthesis and increased degradation of ECM proteins.We recently demonstrated that lefty does not inhibit the promoter activity of CTGF on its own but is able to impart a significant inhibition on CTGF promoter activity induced by TGF-β (21Ulloa L. Tabibzadeh S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21387-21396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The results reported here extend these earlier in vitro observations and show that CTGF mRNA expression is significantly down-regulated in vivo in the tumors derived from lefty+ fibroblasts. These data allowed the prediction that the reduced expression of CTGF inlefty+ tumors would lead to reduced steady-state level of collagen type I mRNA. Our findings clearly demonstrated the validity of this prediction and showed that both the collagen type I mRNA and accumulation of collagen and extracellular matrix inlefty+ tumors were significantly reduced. The extent of deposition of extracellular matrix and collagen was greatly diminished in both the central and leading edge of the tumors transduced with lefty as compared with their control counterparts. These latter tumors showed highly sclerotic centers, and a significant amount of collagen fibers was present at the peripheral borders of such tumors. These findings support the view that lefty regulates the deposition of extracellular matrix and collagen in the stroma. The reduced collagen in the ECM could be attributed, to some extent, to the decreased steady-state level of CTGF and collagen I mRNA.Besides regulation of synthesis, deposition of ECM proteins is controlled by their rate of degradation. The breakdown of extracellular matrix is essential in embryonic development, tissue morphogenesis, menstrual shedding, bone formation, tissue resorption after delivery, blastocyst implantation, and tumor growth and invasion. This breakdown requires precisely coordinated and controlled timely expression and activation of cytokines and a host of enzymes that degrade diverse cellular and ECM proteins. We showed that lefty significantly induces a proteolytic cascade in vivo that is comprised of collagenolytic, gelatinolytic, elastolytic, and caseinolytic activities. One possible explanation for these effects is that lefty itself has enzymatic activity. Lefty is a member of the TGF-β family of molecules, and another member of this family, bone morphogenetic protein-1, which is also known as procollagen C-proteinase, has been shown to possess metalloprotease activity (23Kothapalli R.

Science. 1996; 271: 360-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Bone morphogenetic protein-1 cleaves the C-terminal propeptides of procollagen types I, II, and III. Lefty shows a very low homology to bone morphogenetic protein-1 and lacks the highly conserved cysteine switch sequence (PRCG(V/N)PD) and the catalytic domain with a zinc binding motif (HEXXHXXGXXH) (57Nagase H. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3851) Google Scholar) that are shared by all matrixin family members (21Ulloa L. Tabibzadeh S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21387-21396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It was recently shown that treatment of fibroblasts with tropoelastin or with heterogenic peptides obtained after organo-alkaline or leukocyte elastase hydrolysis of insoluble elastin induced high expression of pro-MMP-1 and pro-MMP-3 (54Brassart B. Fuchs P. Huet E. Alix A.J. Wallach J. Tamburro A.M. Delacoux F. Haye B. Emonard H. Hornebeck W. Debelle L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5222-5227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, lefty lacks the VGVAPG or the consensus sequence GXXPG, which was found to be the minimal domain required for binding to elastin receptor on fibroblasts to trigger signals that lead to the expression of MMP-1 and MMP-3 (54Brassart B. Fuchs P. Huet E. Alix A.J. Wallach J. Tamburro A.M. Delacoux F. Haye B. Emonard H. Hornebeck W. Debelle L. J. Biol.

These findings argue against the possibility that lefty possesses an enzymatic activity that directly causes cleavage of collagen, gelatin, or elastin.A second possible likely scenario is that lefty induces proteolytic activity in fibroblasts or other cell types present in vivoor acts as an inhibitor for those cytokines such as TGF-β that suppress the activation of enzyme(s) that cause degradation of ECM proteins (58Werner F.

Among the possible enzymes that lefty actions might target are serine proteinases, soluble or membrane-bound MMPs, or fibroblast activation protein. Fibroblast activation protein is a cell membrane serine prolyl oligopeptidase and gelatinase that acts as a dual-specificity dipeptidyl peptidase and collagenase and is expressed by sarcomas and fibroblastic cells in areas of active tissue remodeling (57Nagase H.

Another group of candidates are members of the ADAM family that have recognized roles in proteolysis of extracellular matrix components (63Wolfsberg T.G. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. White J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The serine proteinase inhibitor α1-antitrypsin significantly inhibited the elastase activity induced by lefty but did not inhibit the collagenase activity induced by lefty. These findings show that lefty is capable of inducing the activity of both the serine and non-serine proteinase class of enzymes. The serine protease family is one of the oldest and largest multigene families either secreted or sequestered in the membrane and is well positioned to interact with other proteins that contain extracellular serine protease domains (64Hooper J.D. Clements J.A. Quigley J.P. Antalis T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 857-860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). This family includes proteases with elastolytic activity, but elastin is also degraded by enzymes that are found in thiol, aspartic, and metallo enzymes (65Bieth J.G. Mecham R.P. Regulation of Matrix Accumulation. 1986: 217-320Crossref Google Scholar).Of the known MMPs, the 92- and 72-kDa mouse and human macrophage metalloelastase and matrilysin all degrade insoluble elastin. MMPs, also known as matrixins, are a family of highly homologus zinc metalloenzymes that collectively digest virtually all extracellular matrix proteins and constituents of basal lamina including collagen, gelatin, elastin, entactin, laminin, and fibronectin (57Nagase H. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3851) Google Scholar, 66Tabibzadeh S. Babaknia A. Hum. Reprod. 1995; 10: 1579-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Thus far, at least 22 soluble and 6 different membrane-type MMPs have been reported (57Nagase H. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol.

Some members of this family, such as 72-kDa gelatinase A (MMP-2), 92-kDa gelatinase B (MMP-9), and stromelysins have broad substrate specificity and digest several ECM proteins including collagen, denatured collagen (gelatin), fibronectin, and laminin, whereas others, such as the newly described uterus-specific endometase, cleave type I gelatin but do not digest collagens, laminin, elastin, or β-casein (62Park J.E.

Collagenase 2 (MMP-8), which is predominantly expressed in the postpartum and involuting uterus, has preferential activity against type I collagen (70Balbin M. Fueyo A. Knauper V. Pendas A.M.

Once activated, some members of this family, such as membrane-type MMPs, activate other members of the MMP family such as MMP-2 (71Pei D. Weiss S.J. J. Biol.

Strikingly, stromelysin-1 (MMP-3) proteolytically activates at least five other members of the MMP family including interstitial collagenase-1 (MMP-1), matrilysin (MMP-7), neutrophil collagenase-2 (MMP-8), 92-kDa type IV collagenase (MMP-9), and collagenase-3 (MMP-13), suggesting that stromelysin-1 holds a special “upstream” role in ECM degradation and remodeling (74Murphy G.

Although we failed to show an increased expression of MMP-3 in the lefty+ tumors (data not shown), incubation of endometrial explants with recombinant Escherichia coli lefty caused a significant increase in MMP-3 expression. 2K. Osteen and S. Tabibzadeh, unpublished data. These findings show that the effect of lefty on MMP expression may be contextual.Our findings show that lefty acts in a manner that is distinctly opposite to the effects of TGF-β on fibroblasts in vivo.For several reasons, an attractive model is one in which the in vivo actions of lefty on CTGF and collagen mRNA expression, as well as reduced accumulation and increased degradation of ECM proteins, might be mediated by inhibition of the signaling of TGF-β. First, there is a close correlation between the expression of TGF-β and the extent of fibrosis in human adenocarcinomas that exhibit central fibrosis (79Asakura S. Kato H. Fujino S. Konishi T. Tezuka N. Mori A. Hum. Pathol. 1999; 30: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The overexpression of TGF-β in PANC-1 pancreatic carcinoma cells led to desmoplasia in experimental tumors in the pancreas of athymic mice (80Lohr M. Schmidt C. Ringel J. Kluth M. Muller P. Nizze H. Jesnowski R. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 550-555PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to these effects of TGF-β, in our fibrosarcoma model, the central fibrosis seen in the control tumors was abated by introduction of lefty into the tumor cells. Similarly, the deposition of collagen at the peripheral regions of tumors was distinctly reduced by the use of lefty+ cells. Second, lefty inhibits diverse gene transcriptional activities that are driven by TGF-β (21Ulloa L. Tabibzadeh S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21387-21396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). CTGF is transcriptionally up-regulated by TGF-β by a pathway that recruits Smad3 and Smad4, making it a likely target for lefty actions (22Holmes A. Sa S. Shiwen X. Black C.M. Abraham D.J. Leask A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10594-10601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, lefty inhibited the CTGF promoter activity induced by TGF-β in vitro (21Ulloa L. Tabibzadeh S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21387-21396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and reduced CTGF mRNA expression in vivo. Our studies showed that lefty is capable of down-regulating collagen type I mRNA, one of the best-characterized TGF-β-induced genes (81Zhang W. Ou J. Inagaki Y. Greenwel P. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39237-39245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 82Greenwel P. Inagaki Y. Hu W. Walsh M. Ramirez F. J. Biol.

Also, the effects of lefty were similar to other approaches that inhibit the TGF-β activities such as administration of soluble betaglycan, antisense TGF-β, and antibody to TGF-β, which all led to decreased accumulation of extracellular matrix (83Vilchis-Landeros M.M.

Growth Factors. 1994; 11: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), whereas lefty exerts an effect that is distinctly opposite to these actions of TGF-β. Collectively, these arguments suggest that lefty might actin vivo by inhibiting the TGF-β action, thereby contributing to decreased accumulation of ECM in vivo.In conclusion, the findings presented here suggest that lefty is a member of a family of proteins that participate in the homeostasis and remodeling of the ECM deposited by fibroblastic cells. In addition, the findings from this study are significant because they provide a broader understanding that lefty regulates the expression of CTGF and collagen mRNA, deposition of ECM and collagen, and degradation of ECM proteins in vivo. A challenging task would be to identify the in vivo pathways through which lefty regulates CTGF and collagen mRNA expression and characterize the enzymatic cascade that lefty utilizes to cause the remodeling of ECM by increasing proteolytic activities. Such an insight would be quite pertinent to a wide variety of physiologic conditions such as menstrual shedding, blastocyst implantation and embryogenesis, wound repair, repair of endometrium after menstruation, and to human diseases that are associated with aberrant fibroblast proliferation as well as development of tumor stroma. Tissues have a supporting fibrovascular framework that undergoes constant remodeling. Generally, in normal tissues, a balance is reached between the formation and destruction of extracellular matrices (ECMs),1 leading to a state of homeostasis. Acceleration of formation of ECM is a necessary event in some conditions, such as healing of wounds, repair of endometrium after menstruation, and embryonic development. In other physiologic conditions such as tissue breakdown in menstruating endometrium, endometrial tissue invasion by blastocyst, uterine tis"

A closely related aa3-type oxidase is found in members of the α subgroup of the proteobacteria, including Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Defective assembly of the bacterial aa3-type oxidase does not inhibit growth because of the presence of alternative terminal oxidases in the cell (1Yun C.-H. Beci R. Crofts A.R. Kaplan S. Gennis R.B.

Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar), whereas the mitochondrial oxidase has up to 13 different polypeptides encoded by both nuclear and mitochondrial genes (6Capaldi R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 569-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The three largest subunits of the bacterial oxidase are integral membrane proteins homologous to the subunits synthesized in mitochondria (7Cao J. Shapleigh J. Gennis R. Revzin A. Ferguson-Miller S.

Conversion of the vinyl group at position 2 of the heme B porphyrin ring to a hydroxyfarnesyl moiety by the farnesyltransferase, Cox10p, forms heme O (16Puustinen A. Wikström M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Hemes A and O both contain the hydrophobic farnesyl group but are readily distinguished by optical spectroscopy because heme A has a formyl rather than a methyl group at position 8 of the porphyrin ring. Many soluble hemoproteins require heme to achieve a native fold but assume a partially folded state in the absence of heme (Ref. 18Feng Y. Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10150-10155Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar and references therein). The role that heme A plays in the folding and assembly of the integral membrane aa3-type oxidase complex is not well defined. An early investigation using fetal rat liver concludes that apocytochrome c oxidase fails to accumulate in the absence of ∂-aminolevulinic acid, a precursor of all hemes (19Woods J.S. Mol.

In fact, significant amounts of free subunit I are observed in bacterial membranes when heme A is present (22Haltia T. Semo N. Arrondo J.L.R. Goni F.M. Freire E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9731-9740Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 23Bratton M.R. Hiser L. Antholine W.E. Hoganson C. Hosler J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12989-12995Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Subunit I is relatively abundant (72% of control) in mitochondria of patients with acox10 mutation encoding a partially active protein (24Valnot I. von Kleist-Retzow J.-C. Barrientos A. Gorbatyuk M.

Taken together, these studies raise the question of what role heme A plays in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase. In this report, the ability of subunit I to accumulate in the R. sphaeroides membrane in the absence of heme A was studied. An affinity tag on subunit I was used to isolate partially assembled forms of cytochrome c oxidase from cells lacking the genes for the assembly factors Cox10p and Cox11p (8Cao J. Hosler J. Shapleigh J. Revzin A. Ferguson-Miller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24273-24278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heme A was absent because of the cox10 deletion; Cox11p is necessary for the formation of CuB (25Hiser L. Di Valentin M. Hamer A.G. Hosler J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 619-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The ability of subunit I lacking heme A to associate with the other members of the protein complex was investigated by expressing subunit I with subunits II and/or III. Plasmids with various combinations of the genes for R. sphaeroides cytochrome c oxidase subunits I, II, and III (see Table I) were constructed using standard molecular techniques (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmid pYJ123H contains thecoxI-His gene and the coxII/III operon (coxII, cox10, cox11, andcoxIII) in pUC19 (27Zhen Y. Qian J. Follmann K. Hayward T. Nilsson T. Dahn M. Hilmi Y. Hamer A.G. Hosler J.P. Ferguson-Miller S. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 326-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Deletions of 4.3- or 3.3-kb1 SmaI fragments from pYJ123H were made, respectively, to create plasmids containing only coxI-His (pJH310) or coxI-His andcoxIII both driven off the coxI promoter (pJH103H). For expression in R. sphaeroides strain YZ200 (27Zhen Y. Qian J. Follmann K. Hayward T. Nilsson T. Dahn M. Hilmi Y. Hamer A.G. Hosler J.P. Ferguson-Miller S.

Gene (Amst.). 1988; 70: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar) was used. The 2.5-kb EcoRI-HindIII fragment from pJH310 was inserted into the multiple cloning site of pRK415-1 to create pWA302. Similarly, the 3.4-kb EcoRI-HindIII fragment of pJH103H was placed into pRK415-1 to make pAH103H.Table IPlasmids created in this study and their expression products in R. sphaeroidesPlasmid nameGenes on plasmidVectorExpressed proteinpJH310coxI-HispUC19pWA302coxI-HispRK415–1CoxIpJH103HcoxI-His, coxIIIpUC19pAH103HcoxI-His, coxIIIpRK415–1CoxI-IIIpMB307acoxI-His, coxII, cox10, cox11pUC19pWA300coxI-His, coxIIpUC19pRKpWA300coxI-His, coxIIpRK415–1CoxI-IIpAH123Δ10,11coxI-His, coxII, coxIIIpUC19pRKpAH123Δ10,11coxI-His, coxII, coxIIIpRK415–1CoxI-II-IIIpMB301coxIIIpBC SK+pLH339coxII, coxIIIpUC19pLH347coxII, coxIIIpRK415–1CoxII/III Open table in a new tab Plasmid pMB307 is related to pYJ123H but does not contain coxIII (23Bratton M.R. Hiser L. Antholine W.E. Hoganson C. Hosler J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12989-12995Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to change two nucleotides to introduce a SmaI site 20 nucleotides 3′ of the cox10 initiation codon. The resulting plasmid was named pMB307a. Deletion of the 1.6-kb SmaI fragment from pMB307a left coxI-His and coxII on opposite strands, each under the control of its natural promoter. This plasmid was designated pWA300. The addition of a 956-base pairSmaI fragment from pMB301 (see below) to pWA300 created pAH123Δ10,11, which contains coxI-His on one DNA strand and coxII and coxIII behind the coxIIpromoter on the opposite strand. The plasmid pMB301 was created by ligating the 956-base pair SmaI fragment from pYJ100 (27Zhen Y. Qian J. Follmann K. Hayward T. Nilsson T. Dahn M. Hilmi Y. Hamer A.G. Hosler J.P. Ferguson-Miller S. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 326-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) into the multiple cloning site of pBC SK + (Stratagene). The expression vectors pRKpWA300 and pRKpAH123Δ10,11 were derived from pWA300 and pAH123Δ10,11, respectively, by placing 3.7- or 4.6-kbEcoRI-HindIII fragments into pRK415-1. To create the control plasmid containing only coxII andcoxIII, a 1.15-kb SalI fragment internal tocoxI-His was deleted from pAH123Δ10,11 removing greater than 60% of the coxI open reading frame and creating pLH339. The 3.5-kb EcoRI-HindIII fragment of pLH339 was then placed into pRK415-1 to form pLH347. Each of the pRK415-based plasmids was conjugated into R. sphaeroidesstrain YZ200 by the published method (29Donohue T.J. Kaplan S. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 459-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). R. sphaeroides cells were grown in minimal medium to the late exponential phase (25Hiser L. Di Valentin M. Hamer A.G. Hosler J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 619-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Protein was purified by affinity chromatography on Ni-NTA-agarose from cytoplasmic membranes solubilized inN-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside as previously described (25Hiser L. Di Valentin M. Hamer A.G. Hosler J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 619-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) except that the concentration of KCl in the purification buffers was 150 mm rather than 40 mm KCl. This change in the salt concentration did not significantly affect the ability to purify the oxidase subcomplexes. Electrophoresis was conducted in 14% polyacrylamide gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate and 6 m urea (30Hosler J.P. Fetter J. Tecklenburg M.M.J. Espe M. Lerma C. Ferguson-Miller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24264-24272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins were visualized by rapid staining with Coomassie Blue (31Wong C. Sridhara S. Bardwell J.C.A. Jakob U. BioTechniques. 2000; 28: 426-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). For immunoblots, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and probed essentially as described (32Peiffer W.E. Ingle R.T. Ferguson-Miller S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8696-8701Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For detection of subunit I, a 1:5000 dilution of a monoclonal antibody against polyhistidine (Sigma) was used with colorimetric detection. For detection of subunit II, a polyclonal primary antibody raised against subunit II of the R. sphaeroides aa3-type oxidase 2J. P. Hosler and S. Ferguson-Miller, unpublished data. was used at a 1:400 dilution with protein A-125I as the secondary reagent. R. sphaeroides cells were grown in minimal medium to the exponential phase (OD660 = ∼0.3). The cells were then washed with minimal medium prepared with chloride rather than sulfate salts and incubated in this medium for 4 h to decrease the pool of free methionine and cysteine. Radiolabeled methionine and cysteine were then added to the culture (1 mCi/50 ml) in the form of EasyTag EXPRESS (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Growth was rapidly stopped after 10 min by the addition of 0.01% chloramphenicol, 2% NaN3, 15 mm EDTA and placing the cells on ice. The culture was then divided into six equal portions for processing. After washing the cells, the extracts were prepared by vortexing in the presence of glass beads and the protease inhibitor, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Membranes were isolated by centrifugation at 350,000 × g for 20 min. Washed membranes were solubilized inN-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, and the polyhistidine-tagged subunit I was bound to and eluted from Ni-NTA-agarose in a batch process in a microcentrifuge tube using a procedure similar to that used for column purification. The entire eluted fraction was prepared for denaturing gel electrophoresis, and fixed gels were exposed to a phosphor screen and analyzed using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). The necessity of heme A for steady-state accumulation of subunit I in the cytoplasmic membrane of R. sphaeroides was investigated using a strain (YZ200) with a genomic deletion of the coxII/III operon containing the coxII, cox10, cox11, andcoxIII genes (27Zhen Y. Qian J. Follmann K. Hayward T. Nilsson T. Dahn M. Hilmi Y. Hamer A.G. Hosler J.P. Ferguson-Miller S. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 326-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Because the product of thecox10 gene, Cox10p, is required for heme A synthesis (33Tzagoloff A. Nobrega M. Gorman N. Sinclair P. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 593-598PubMed Google Scholar), YZ200 membranes had only b- and c-type cytochromes (Fig. 1). A low copy, broad host range expression vector containing the gene for subunit I with a carboxyl-terminal His6 tag was used to express subunit I in YZ200 in a form that could be readily purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. As expected, the cytochrome a peak (∼606 nm) was absent from the reduced minus oxidized membrane spectrum (Fig.1, CoxI) because of the absence of Cox10p. However, a polypeptide was isolated that migrated on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel like wild-type subunit I and was identified as the product of thecoxI-His gene using an antibody against the His6tag (Fig. 2, lane 2).Figure 2Isolated oxidase subunits. The proteins were isolated from approximately equal numbers of R. sphaeroides strain YZ200 cells expressing various plasmids listed in Table I, the vector pRK415-1 (column 1), or pRKpAH1H32 (WT; 25). Four separate gels were used for electrophoresis with loading of samples normalized to the percentage of material eluted from the affinity column. Less of the normal oxidase (WT) was used to give approximately equal signal intensities. Following electrophoresis, detection of the oxidase subunits was by immunoblotting (CoxIp and CoxIIp) or by staining with Coomassie (CoxIIIp and lanes 7 and 8).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The ability to purify the subunit I polypeptide from a strain with acox10 deletion demonstrated that the expression and membrane insertion of this protein was independent of heme A production. The possibility that another type of heme was substituted for heme A was addressed by measuring the heme content of the isolated protein using the pyridine hemochrome method (34Berry E.A. Trumpower B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Heme B was identified in minor molar amounts (about 5% that of total protein) in protein isolated from the strain expressing CoxI. However, a similar amount of heme B was also found in a control experiment using membranes from strain YZ200 harboring only the parent vector (pRK415-1). Thus, heme B was likely to have been present as a minor cytochrome bcontaminant that bound nonspecifically to the metal chelating resin. The other prosthetic group of subunit I, CuB, was likely to be absent because of the deletion of the cox11 gene (25Hiser L. Di Valentin M. Hamer A.G. Hosler J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 619-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Thus, the isolated product was presumed to be aposubunit I,i.e. lacking both hemes and CuB. Throughout this report, the term “aposubunit I” will refer to the product of thecoxI gene expressed in cells lacking cox10 andcox11. The ability of R. sphaeroides aposubunit I to associate with subunits II and III was ascertained using a copurification assay. Membrane proteins from cells expressing plasmid-bornecoxI-His, coxII, and coxIII genes (CoxI-II-III; Table I) were subjected to affinity chromatography on Ni-NTA-agarose. The eluted material contained all three subunits, which were identified by gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and8). Because only aposubunit I contained the His6tag, the isolation of subunits II and III via histidine affinity chromatography indicated formation of a complex containing all three subunits. Subunits II and III were not retained on Ni-NTA-agarose when they were expressed from CoxII/III (Table I) in the absence of polyhistidine-tagged subunit I (data not shown). Thus, the copurification of subunits II and III with aposubunit I demonstrated that formation of the three-subunit oxidase complex was independent of heme A insertion into subunit I. This CoxI-II-III complex was termed “apooxidase” because, in addition to the lack of heme A, metal analysis showed substoichiometric amounts of copper (data not shown). This suggested that there was little or no CuA in subunit II. CuB was presumed to be absent because of thecox11 deletion (25Hiser L. Di Valentin M. Hamer A.G. Hosler J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 619-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The isolation of the apooxidase was a novel result, but the significance of this observation to the normal assembly of cytochrome c oxidase remains to be determined. To begin to address this question, the extent of complex formation was compared in strains that differed only by the presence or absence ofcox10 and cox11 genes on the expression plasmid. The cells were labeled in vivo with35S-containing amino acids. Complexes containing the product of the coxI-His gene were isolated from cell membranes using Ni-NTA-agarose. Expression of the subunit I polypeptide and the extent of complex formation were evaluated after 10 min of cell labeling (Fig. 3). Aposubunit I was expressed to a level at least equal to that of subunit I in the wild-type strain (Fig. 3, A and B). All three subunits were detected from both the control strain (WT) and the strain lacking heme A (Fig. 3 A, CoxI-II-III). Because of the low subunit II signal, attributed to a relatively small number of methionines and cysteines, subunit III was chosen for the purpose of quantitation. Approximately 30% of the newly translated subunit I from cells containing heme A (WT) and 10% of the aposubunit I from cells lacking heme A (CoxI-II-III) had associated with labeled subunit III (Fig. 3 C). Because of the possible existence of an unlabeled pool of subunit III available for assembly, these numbers were taken to be a conservative estimate of the extent of complex formation. One possible explanation for the observed difference between formation of the apooxidase and the holooxidase control is a decreased affinity of subunit III for subunit I in the absence of heme A. The accumulation of the normal oxidase (WT) and apooxidase (CoxI-II-III) to comparable levels in the bacterial membrane was indicated by the ability to isolate similar amounts of these proteins from steady-state cell cultures (data not shown). Generally, however, the yield of apooxidase was about 20% of the yield of normal oxidase from the same number of cells. These low recoveries may have resulted from an instability of the apooxidase in vitro; aposubunit I showed a tendency to precipitate. The smaller scale and more rapid processing of the pulse-labeled cultures may have minimized the effects of any such instability. Because a complex of aposubunit I with subunits II and III formed to a level of at least 30% relative to formation of a similar complex containing heme A, the role of aposubunit I in the assembly of the normal oxidase deserves consideration. The assembly pathway for mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase is believed to be sequential or ordered (35Wielburski A. Nelson B.D. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 36Nijtmans L.G.J. Taanman J.-W. Muijsers A.O. Speijer D. Van Den Bogert C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). To directly determine the minimal requirements for the association of subunit I with the other core subunits, copurification of subunit II or subunit III with aposubunit I was tested. R. sphaeroides cells expressing coxI-His andcoxII or coxI-His and coxIII were studied. Both CoxI-II and CoxI-III heterodimers were isolated from cells lacking heme A (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4). This result demonstrated that there was no obligate order of assembly for the protein subunits because both subunits II and III were competent to associate with subunit I in the absence of heme A. In this study, assembly of the three catalytic core proteins of cytochrome c oxidase was investigated using theaa3-type oxidase from R. sphaeroides. Both aposubunit I and a three-subunit apooxidase were isolated from strains lacking heme A. These proteins inserted into the cytoplasmic membrane and accumulated to significant levels (at least 30%) compared with their heme A-containing counterparts. Thus, the insertion of heme A was not a prerequisite for subunit assembly of the oxidase. Conversely, subunit association is not required for insertion of one molecule of heme A (23Bratton M.R. Hiser L. Antholine W.E. Hoganson C. Hosler J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12989-12995Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that heme A insertion may be able to occur at multiple steps in the assembly process. A dependence on order for the association of aposubunit I with the other structural subunits was investigated using strains expressing two of the subunits in the absence of heme A. Two distinct subcomplexes containing aposubunit I (CoxI-II and CoxI-III) were isolated (Fig. 2,lanes 3 and 4). Because aposubunit I could associate with either subunit II or subunit III in genetically manipulated strains, it was concluded that there was no obligate order of subunit assembly. Thus, the possibility of multiple paths must be considered in determining the assembly process of cytochromec oxidase in wild-type cells. Insertion of the prosthetic groups also appears to be unordered because heme A is incorporated into subunit I in the absence of other subunits (23Bratton M.R. Hiser L. Antholine W.E. Hoganson C. Hosler J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12989-12995Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) but is not required for subunit assembly of several apooxidase forms (i.e. CoxI-II, CoxI-III, and CoxI-II-III). A “state diagram” is a way of illustrating a finite set of possible assembly paths where some states (subcomplexes) lie on multiple paths. There are 32 theoretical oxidase assembly intermediates that contain subunit I, considering only the three metal centers within subunit I and the three large structural subunits. These possible partially assembled oxidase forms are arranged in Fig.4 based on the number of prosthetic groups in subunit I and the number of protein subunits such that assembly proceeds from left to right and components are added one at a time. From this study and others (23Bratton M.R. Hiser L. Antholine W.E. Hoganson C. Hosler J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12989-12995Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 25Hiser L. Di Valentin M. Hamer A.G. Hosler J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 619-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), a few of these oxidase forms (shown as schematics) have been isolated from steady-state membranes, and the logical paths between them can be inferred. Assuming that none of these purified subcomplexes lie on dead-end paths, the conclusion must be made that assembly of the holoenzyme is not a strictly ordered process. For example, the addition of subunit III can be the initial step (to form CoxI-III) or the final step between Iaa3CuB-II and the normal oxidase, Iaa3CuB-II-III. Note that some subcomplexes (e.g. I-II-III) lie on multiple putative paths. The existence of the majority of the theoretical states is currently undetermined, and the extent to which any given subcomplex or putative path exists in wild-type bacteria remains to be investigated. Therefore, the partially assembled forms of the oxidase that have been isolated from genetically manipulated bacteria may or may not be bona fide assembly intermediates. The deletion of cox10 and cox11 in R. sphaeroides did not prevent the accumulation of aposubunit I in bacterial cytoplasmic membranes or its association with subunits II or III (Fig. 2). Consistent with these results, subunit I with no heme A accumulates to a low level in mitochondria of a yeast strain with a disruption of the gene for Cox10p (21Nobrega M.P. Nobrega F.G. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14220-14226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that prokaryotes and eukaryotes have similar mechanisms for assembly of the cytochromec oxidase core subunits. Furthermore, the gene for Cox11p was unaltered in the yeast strain (21Nobrega M.P. Nobrega F.G. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14220-14226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the genetic alteration critical for the observed phenotypes in the present study was the cox10 deletion. This is consistent with our observation that an apooxidase (CoxI-II-III) was isolated from aR. sphaeroides strain containing the wild-typecox11 gene and a deletion of cox10 (data not shown). The posttranslational loss of significant amounts of subunit I in yeast (21Nobrega M.P. Nobrega F.G. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14220-14226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) could be due to in vivo degradation or, as indicated in the present study, could be explained by an in vitro instability during sample preparation or by structural alterations that reduce the ability of the epitope to be recognized by the antiserum. These explanations are also relevant to the report of aP. denitrificans strain with a deletion of the genes corresponding to coxII, cox10, andcox11 that does not express immunologically detectable subunit I (20Steinrücke P. Gerhus E. Ludwig B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7676-7681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that modest overexpression of the gene for subunit I and isolation of the protein, as opposed to analysis in the membrane, significantly enhanced our ability to detect aposubunit I in this study. In conclusion, heme A is not essential for the expression, membrane insertion, or association of the core complex proteins of cytochromec oxidase in R. sphaeroides. Furthermore, the assembly of this heterooligomeric integral membrane complex need not follow a linear or ordered pathway. The structural similarities between the bacterial and mitochondrial oxidases suggest that these findings may extend to assembly of the human oxidase. A “state model” has been proposed as a paradigm for describing the multiple possible assembly paths.

Although glutamine hydrolysis is the usual source of ammonia for carbamoyl phosphate synthesis, mitochondrial CPSase I, the enzyme that catalyzes the first step in the urea cycle (1Meister A. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1989; 62: 315-374PubMed Google Scholar), has an inactive homolog of the GLN subunit fused to the amino end of the synthetase subunit. Consequently, CPSase I cannot hydrolyze glutamine, and instead it uses ammonia directly as the nitrogen-donating substrate. Although the CPSases have a diverse structural organization, they share a common catalytic mechanism (1Meister A. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1989; 62: 315-374PubMed Google Scholar) that proceeds through a complex series of partial reactions.HCO3−+ATP→carboxy phosphate+ADPREACTION2carboxy phosphate+NH3→carbamate+PiREACTION3carbamate+ATP→carbamoyl phosphate+ADPREACTION4Lusty and Nyunoya (7Nyunoya H.

They noted that the sequence of the synthetase subunit consists of two highly homologous halves that probably arose from a duplication, translocation, and fusion of an ancestral kinase gene. Similarly, they found that the GLN subunit consists of two domains, one of which shared homology to other triad-type amidotransferases (9Zalkin H. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 263-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This structural organization was confirmed when the x-ray structure of E. coli CPSase was solved (10Thoden J.B.

One of the most interesting aspects of the x-ray structure was the presence of intramolecular tunnels connecting the active sites ensuring that the labile intermediates are sequestered.

Chem. 1990; 265: 7742-7747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that CPS.A catalyzes the activation of bicarbonate, whereas CPS.B is responsible for the phosphorylation of carbamate to form carbamoyl phosphate. Although the two domains have a specialized function in the native molecule, they are functionally equivalent (19Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol.

The isolated domains form homodimers that catalyze both ATP-dependent partial reactions and the overall synthesis of carbamoyl phosphate from bicarbonate, NH3, and two ATP molecules. The only apparent functional difference between the CPS.A and CPS.B dimers is that the latter is subject to allosteric control because effectors bind to the regulatory subdomain (21Rodriguez-Aparicio L.B.

With the advent of genome sequence projects, it became apparent that some hyperthermophilic organisms, including Methanococcus jannaschii (33Bult C.J. White O. Olsen G.J. Zhou L. Fleischmann R.D.

Instead, these genomes have open reading frames that encode proteins with deduced amino acid sequences that closely resemble the GLN, CPS.A, and CPS.B domains of mesophilic CPSases. We report, for the first time, the cloning and expression of these genes from A. aeolicusand the reconstitution of functional complexes. Pfu DNA polymerase was obtained from Stratagene, DNA ligase from Life Technologies, Inc., sodium [14C]bicarbonate from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and Sephacryl S-300 High Resolution from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.The nucleotides and the enzymes pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, hexokinase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and glutamate dehydrogenase were from Sigma. A. aeolicus aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase) was isolated 2C. Purcarea, T. Lu, A. Ahuja, L. Kovari, and D. R. Evans, submitted for publication. as described elsewhere. A. aeolicus chromosomal DNA was a generous gift of Drs. Karl O. Stetter and Robert Huber from Regensburg University. TheE. coli strains used were DH5α (Life Technologies, Inc.) and BL21(DE3) (Stratagene). The plasmid, pRSETB, a His tag expression vector (Invitrogen) was used for the construction of pAACPSA, pAACPSB, and pAAGLN recombinants encoding the A. aeolicus CPS.A, CPS.B, and glutaminase (GLN) subunits, respectively. The genes encoding the carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase subunits were obtained by polymerase chain reaction using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene), 180 ng of the template A. aeolicuschromosomal DNA, and 100 pmol of primers. The 5′ and 3′ primers used for amplification were the following: for carA (GLN), 5′-CGGAACTCGAGCATTTTGGCGCTTGAGGACGG-3′ and 5′-ACTTCTGCAGCTCCTC ATCCCTGAGCCAT-3′; for carB2 (CPS.A), 5′-CTTTGGGATCCAAAAGGACGGACATCAAG-3′ and 5′-TAAACAAGATCTTTAATCTTCATCAAGGATTTC-3′; and for carB1(CPS.B), 5′-TTCTTGGATCCTAAAAAGGTTGTAATACTCGGA-3′ and 5′-ATAAAGATCTCTAGGTCCATAAGAATTTGTA-3′. Each primer also included a restriction site to facilitate subcloning:XhoI/PstI for carA,BamHI/BglII for carB1, andBamHI/BglII for carB2. The amplified DNA fragments were cleaved with the appropriate restriction enzymes and inserted into the corresponding sites of the pRSETB expression vector and co-transformed with the plasmid pSJS1240 into E. coliBL21 (DE3). The helper plasmid pSJS1240 (35Kim R. Sandler J. Goldman S. Yokota H. Clark A.J. Kim S.H. Bio/Technol. Lett. 1998; 20: 207-210Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar) encodes two tRNA synthetases that recognize the codons AUA for isoleucine and AGA for serine. These codons occur infrequently in E. coli but are highly represented in the A. aeolicus genome. Each of the proteins is expressed as a fusion protein with a 3-kDa His-tagged polypeptide attached to the amino end of the enzyme. The cells harvested from a 100-ml culture were resuspended in 3 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol and disrupted by six 30-s bursts of sonication. The cell extract was centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was applied to a 1.5-ml Ni2+-Probond column pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 200 mm NaCl. The column was washed with 20 ml of the same buffer. The A. aeolicus enzymes were then eluted with 1 ml of increasing concentrations of imidazole up to 200 mm in this buffer. The 1-ml fractions were analyzed by electrophoresis on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and those containing pure proteins were dialyzed at 4 °C against 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The proteins were stored in the same buffer except that 10% glycerol was added to the GLN subunit storage buffer. The glutaminase activity was measured by coupling the formation of l-glutamate to the production of α-ketoglutarate using l-glutamate dehydrogenase (15Post L.E. Post D.J. Raushel F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7742-7747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay mixture, consisting of varying concentrations of glutamine in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8, was pre-equilibrated at 78 °C for 1.5 min before starting the reaction with 30 μg of the enzyme. The reaction was quenched after 1.5 min with 50 μl of 1m HCl, and the reaction mixture was then placed on ice for 15 min. The pH was neutralized by the addition of 270 μl of 1m Tris-HCl, pH 10. The sample was then added to 600 μl of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.8 mm acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide (APAD), and 20 units of l-glutamate dehydrogenase. The absorbance at 363 nm of reduced APAD was measured after a 45-min incubation at 25 °C, and the concentration of reduced APAD was calculated from a standard curve. For measuring the ammonia-dependent CPSase, the assay mixture consisted of 200 mm ammonium chloride, 50 mm sodium [14C]bicarbonate (100,000–120,000 dpm/μmol), 30 mm ATP, 32 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8, 3 μg of purified A. aeolicus ATCase, 6 mm aspartate, and 30 μg of the enzyme (unless specified otherwise) in a total volume of 0.5 ml. The assay mixture was the same for the glutamine-dependent CPSase except that the ammonium chloride was replaced with 2 mm glutamine. The assay mixture without enzyme and bicarbonate was equilibrated at 78 °C for 1.5 min. The reaction was initiated by the addition of enzyme and bicarbonate, allowed to proceed for 1.5 min, and quenched by the addition of 0.5 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid. The samples were processed for counting as described previously (36Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2190-2197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The saturation curves were obtained by varying the concentration of one substrate while fixing the others at the saturating concentrations given above. The bicarbonate-dependent ATPase was assayed by measuring the rate of ADP formation in the presence and absence of ammonium chloride using a pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase coupled assay (15Post L.E. Post D.J. Raushel F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7742-7747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay mixture contained 50 mm bicarbonate, 100 mm KCl, 30 mm ATP, 32 mm MgCl2, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and, when present, 200 mmammonium chloride in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8, with the coupling substrates and enzymes. Carbamoyl phosphate-dependent ATP synthetase activity was assayed similarly by measuring the rate of ATP formation from ADP and carbamoyl phosphate using a hexokinase/glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-coupled assay (15Post L.E. Post D.J. Raushel F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7742-7747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The partial reactions were only assayed at 25 °C because of the limited stability of the coupling enzymes at elevated temperatures. To determine whether A. aeolicus proteins form stable complexes, 0.5-ml aliquots (3–4 mg) of the purified proteins were applied to a 1.5 × 62-cm Sephacryl S-300 High Resolution column equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8, 200 mm sodium chloride, and 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol. The column was eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.36 ml/min, and fractions (0.5 ml) were analyzed by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm, SDS-gel electrophoresis, and CPSase assays. Bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), apoferritin (443 kDa), and blue dextran were used to calibrate the column. The kinetic parameters were obtained by least squares fit of substrate saturation curves to the Michaelis-Menten or Hill equations using the program Scientist (Micromath). Sequence comparison and multiple alignments were performed by using the GAP and Pileup programs of the GCG software package (Genetics Computer Group, University of Wisconsin) (37Needleman S.B. Wunsch C.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 48: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (7853) Google Scholar). BLAST software was used to search the A. aeolicus genome for open reading frames encoding homologs of mesophilic enzymes. Modeling of the three-dimensional structure and energy minimization was performed using the program SwissModel (38Peitsch M.C. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 658-660Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 39Peitsch M.C. Wells T.N. Stampf D.R. Sussman J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 82-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 40Peitsch M.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar) from the ExPASy server. The structure was visualized and analyzed using the Rasmol and Swiss Protein Database, Viewer 3.7. An exhaustive search of the A. aeolicus genome failed to reveal any open reading frame encoding a protein homologous to the 120-kDa synthetase subunit of E. coli and other eubacterial CPSases. Similarly, a small 35-kDa carbamate kinase-like CPSase, responsible for carbamoyl phosphate synthesis in some archaeal species, was not detected when the genome was searched with seven query sequences representing highly conserved segments of carbamate kinases. However, two open reading frames encoding proteins homologous to the major structural domains ofE. coli CPSase had been identified (34Deckert G. Warren P. Gaasterland T. Young W. Lenox A. Graham D. Overbeek R. Snead M. Keller M. Aujay M. Huber R. Feldman R. Short J. Olson G. Swanson R. Nature. 1998; 392: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). The two A. aeolicus proteins exhibited 39.5% sequence identity to each other (Fig. 1 C), a value similar to that obtained (28.9–50.6%) when the two halves of mesophilic CPSases were aligned. One of these genes, designated carB2 (CPS.A in Fig. 1 C) was found to have significantly greater sequence similarity to the CPS.A domain (49.6–63.0%) than to the CPS.B domain (25.6–33.6%) of other CPSases. The converse was true for the second gene, carB1 (CPS.B), which was located 652 kilobase pairs upstream of carB2 (Fig. 1 A). Thus, the proteins encoded by the A. aeolicus carB2 andcarB1 were designated CPS.A and CPS.B, respectively. An alignment of the A. aeolicus CPS.A and CPS.B subunits at the junction between the two fused domains in the E. coli enzyme is shown in Fig. 1 B. Similarly, the carA gene could be identified unambiguously by its strong sequence similarity (45.3–50.6% identity) to the amidotransferase or glutaminase domain of other well characterized prokaryotic CPSases. CarA is located about 543 kilobase pairs upstream of carB1 and overlaps pyrB, the gene encoding ATCase, by three base pairs. PyrC, which encodes dihydroorotase, was located approximately midway between carA and carB1 (Fig.1). The genes encoding CPS.A, CPS.B, and GLN were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using A. aeolicus chromosomal DNA as the template. The oligonucleotides incorporated convenient restriction sites that allowed each DNA fragment to be inserted in frame into the pRSETB expression vector. This vector appends a His tag to the amino end of the recombinant protein to facilitate purification. The resulting constructs pAAGLN, pAACPSA, and pAACPSB encoding GLN, CPS.A and CPS.B, respectively, were sequenced to confirm the fidelity of the amplification process. Co-transformation of the E. coli BL21(DE3) strain with the helper plasmid pSJS1240 resulted in the expression of high levels of the soluble proteins (28, 40, and 30 mg/liter of culture for CPS.A, CPS.B, and GLN, respectively). Each protein could be purified (Fig. 2) to homogeneity by Ni2+ affinity chromatography. The CPS.A and CPS.B subunits had no detectable NH3-dependent CPSase activity. In contrast, the GLN domain hydrolyzed glutamine to glutamate and ammonia at a rate of 0.87 nmol/min/mg at 25 °C. Although neither CPS.A nor CPS.B alone could catalyze the overall reaction, a stoichiometric mixture of CPS.A and CPS.B catalyzed the formation of carbamoyl phosphate from ammonia, ATP, and bicarbonate at a rate of 5.7 nmol/min/mg (25 °C). Under the same conditions, the rate of ATP hydrolysis was 10.7 nmol/min/mg. 3The initial assays were conducted with a fixed ATP concentration of 10 mm, and thus the values obtained were lower than those given in Table I measured in the presence of 30 mm ATP. The ratio of 1.9:1 of ATP consumed to carbamoyl phosphate formed is consistent with the 2:1 stoichiometry of the classical CPSase mechanism. The isolated CPS.A and CPS.B subunits were found to catalyze both ATP-dependent partial reactions as assayed by established procedures (“Experimental Procedures”). The first partial reaction, the activation of bicarbonate, was measured as a bicarbonate-dependent ATPase in the absence of a nitrogen-donating substrate. Equivalent amounts of CPS.A, CPS.B, and CPS.A-CPS.B had a similar bicarbonate-dependent ATPase activity (Table I). When ammonia was present, allowing the overall reaction to proceed, the ATPase activity of CPS.A and CPS.B remained for the most part unchanged, but the rate of ATP hydrolysis by the CPS.A-CPS.B complex increased 3-fold to 41 nmol/min/mg.Table IATP-dependent partial reactionsProteinHCO3−-dependent ATPaseCP-dependent ATP synthetase−NH3+NH3nmol/min/mgnmol/min/mgnmol/min/mgCPS.A9.62 ± 0.2010.6 ± 0.066.81 ± 0.04CPS.B11.0 ± 0.2015.7 ± 0.041.78 ± 0.04CPS.A-CPS.B1-aFor the CPS.A and CPS.B assays, 60 μg of each protein was present in the assay mixture.

The formation of ADP or ATP was determined in coupled enzyme assays as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The second ATP-dependent partial reaction, the phosphorylation of carbamate, is assayed in the reverse direction as carbamoyl phosphate-dependent ATP synthesis (“Experimental Procedures”). Again, both CPS.A and CPS.B could catalyze this reaction (Table I), although it was surprising that the rate of ATP formation by CPS.A was significantly higher than that observed for either CPS.B or the CPS.A-CPS.B complex. SDS-gel electrophoresis on calibrated polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 2) showed that the molecular mass of the CPS.A, CPS.B, and GLN proteins was 64 ± 1.2, 63 ± 1.6, and 45 ± 1.0 kDa, respectively. These values are close to the molecular weights of 62,289, 60,037, and 41,682 as predicted from the deduced amino acid sequence when the 3-kDa His tag on the recombinant proteins is taken into consideration. The size of each protein was determined under nondenaturing conditions by size exclusion chromatography on a calibrated Sephacryl S-300 column (Fig.3 A). CPS.A eluted as a 66-kDa species, indicating that it is monomeric. In contrast, CPS.B was more heterogeneous. The major species had a molecular mass of 170 kDa, but there was an appreciable fraction that eluted in the void volume, suggesting that the isolated CPS.B aggregates. These results were confirmed by electrophoresis on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (results not shown). The stoichiometric mixture of CPS.A and CPS.B eluted as a 124-kDa dimer, although there was a shoulder on the leading edge that may represent the presence of larger species. Assay of CPSase activity in the column fractions (Fig. 3 A) showed that only the CPS.A-CPS.B dimer had catalytic activity. A mixture of equimolar amounts of CPS.A, CPS.B, and GLN was found to elute as a single 171-kDa species that could catalyze glutamine-dependent carbamoyl phosphate synthesis (Fig.3 B). A complex consisting of one copy of each subunit would be expected to have a mass of 173 kDa. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the peak fractions (Fig. 3 B, insert) showed that the molar ratio of CPS.A-CPS.B:GLN was 1.2, 4Although the difference in mobility between CPS.A and CPS.B can be visualized on the SDS gel, the resolution was not sufficient to individually quantitate each species. consistent with a species comprising equivalent molar amounts of CPS.A-CPS.B and GLN subunits. It is interesting that the major species visualized on the SDS gel had a mass of 170 kDa when the samples were not heated at 100 °C prior to electrophoresis (data not shown), suggesting that the complex is difficult to dissociate even in strong detergents. Taken together, these results show that the GLN, CPS.A, and CPS.B associate to form a stable 1:1:1 heterotrimer. The thermostability of the CPS.A-CPS.B complex was assessed by preincubating the protein at increasing temperatures for 10 min, rapidly cooling the sample, and assaying the CPSase activity at 37 °C. The activity remained unchanged between 25 °C and 60 °C and then abruptly increased 54% at 70 °C (Fig. 4). The precipitous loss of catalytic activity above 80 °C is indicative of thermal denaturation. The temperature at which half the maximum activity was lost is 81 °C. The GLN-CPS.A-CPS.B complex had appreciably greater thermostability, showing"
https://openalex.org/W1561888658,"The functions of thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) are regulated by a host of co-regulatory proteins. Tissue-specific expression of these co-regulators leads to distinct expression patterns and regulation of thyroid hormone (T3) target genes in tissues. Previously we have found that human colon carcinoma RKO cells exhibit strong T3-independent transcriptional activity. We therefore searched for co-regulatory proteins in RKO cells using a yeast two-hybrid system with the intact TRβ1 as bait. One of the three positive clones, designated as P3, was identified to be an isoform of human mitochondria branched-chain aminotransferase (BCATm). P3 was a spliced variant of BCATm with an internal 12-amino acid deletion near the carboxyl-terminal region and was abundantly expressed in RKO cells. The expressed protein localized both to the mitochondria and the nucleus of transfected CV1 cells. P3 physically interacted with TRβ1 in a T3-independent manner that led to the inhibition in binding of TRβ1 to thyroid hormone-responsive element. P3 not only enhanced the repressor activity of the unliganded TR but also repressed the ligand-dependent activation of TR. This repression was reversed by treatment of cells with trichostatin A, suggesting that in addition to the inhibition of DNA binding, the repression activity of P3 on TR may also be mediated by histone deacetylase activity. Thus, unlike the currently known co-repressors, P3 is a novel ligand-independent co-repressor for TR. The functions of thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) are regulated by a host of co-regulatory proteins. Tissue-specific expression of these co-regulators leads to distinct expression patterns and regulation of thyroid hormone (T3) target genes in tissues. Previously we have found that human colon carcinoma RKO cells exhibit strong T3-independent transcriptional activity. We therefore searched for co-regulatory proteins in RKO cells using a yeast two-hybrid system with the intact TRβ1 as bait. One of the three positive clones, designated as P3, was identified to be an isoform of human mitochondria branched-chain aminotransferase (BCATm). P3 was a spliced variant of BCATm with an internal 12-amino acid deletion near the carboxyl-terminal region and was abundantly expressed in RKO cells. The expressed protein localized both to the mitochondria and the nucleus of transfected CV1 cells. P3 physically interacted with TRβ1 in a T3-independent manner that led to the inhibition in binding of TRβ1 to thyroid hormone-responsive element. P3 not only enhanced the repressor activity of the unliganded TR but also repressed the ligand-dependent activation of TR. This repression was reversed by treatment of cells with trichostatin A, suggesting that in addition to the inhibition of DNA binding, the repression activity of P3 on TR may also be mediated by histone deacetylase activity. Thus, unlike the currently known co-repressors, P3 is a novel ligand-independent co-repressor for TR. thyroid hormone receptor branched-chain aminotransferase cytosolic BCAT mitochondrial fetal bovine serum glutathioneS-transferase histone deacetylase thyroid hormone-depleted FBS thyroid hormone response element trichostatin A reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction bovine serum albumin electrophoresis mobility shift assay base pair cytomegalovirus Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium monoclonal antibody retinoid X-receptor Thyroid hormone receptor (TR)1 is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily that acts as ligand-dependent transcription factor to control cell proliferation, differentiation, and homeostasis (1Cheng S.Y. Rev. Endocr. Metab. Disorders. 2000; 1: 9-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two distinct genes, TRα and TRβ, give rise to four hormone-binding TR isoforms (α1, β1, β2, and β3) by alternative splicing (1Cheng S.Y. Rev. Endocr. Metab.

The tissue specificity and differential expression of TR isoforms indicate that they play distinct functional roles in vivo (3Forrest D. Vennstorm B. Thyroid. 2000; 10: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 4Hodin R.A. Lazar M.A. Wintman B.I. Darling D.S. Koenig R.J. Larsen P.R. Moore D.D. Chin W.W. Science. 1989; 244: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). This is demonstrated by the finding that TRβ-knockout mice show very different phenotypes from TRα1-deficient mice. TR regulates transcription by binding to thyroid hormone response element (TRE) as a homodimer or heterodimer in the promoter region of target genes. The transcriptional activity of TR relies on the types of TRE as well as on T3. In the presence of T3, TR functions as a transcriptional activator that binds to positive TREs and as a repressor that binds to negative TREs. Modulation of gene expression by TR involves the coordination of a network of co-regulatory proteins, including co-activators and co-repressors. Binding of ligand to TR induces a conformational change that promotes dissociation of the co-repressors and recruitment of the co-activators, leading to gene activation. Unlike other nuclear hormone receptors, TR and retinoic acid receptors are able to bind to their target genes in the absence of ligands and actively repress transcription (5Baniahmad A. Steiner C.

Although the mechanisms by which TR repress basal transcription are not fully understood, studies suggest that TR interacts with various regulatory proteins to exert its repression functions. Interaction with components of basal transcription machinery, including TATA binding protein and TFIIB, and disruption of the pre-initiation complex formation were shown to be involved in gene silencing by TR (8Fondell J.D.

Investigations of active repression by unliganded TR and retinoic acid receptor have led to the identification of several co-repressors, N-CoR (15Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B.

The repressive activity of N-CoR and SMRT is manifested through their interaction with Sin3 that associates with histone deacetylase (HDAC) to form a co-repressor complex. Recently, isolation and characterization of HDAC3, HDAC5, and HDAC7 showed that SMRT and N-CoR-mediated repression is also promoted by HDAC in a Sin3A-independent fashion (20Yang W.M. Yao Y.L.

Deacetylation of histones is thought to condense chromatin that then becomes less accessible to transcription factor, leading to gene repression. To explore the mechanism of repression by TR, we searched for co-regulatory protein in human colon carcinoma RKO cells by yeast two-hybrid screen using intact TRβ1 as bait. In this study, we report the identification and characterization of a novel co-repressor for TR that interacts with TR in a hormone-insensitive manner. This gene, designated as P3, encodes an isoform of human mitochondria branched-chain aminotransferase (BCATm) that catalyzes the first step in degradation of branched chain amino acids (24Suryawan A. Hawes J.W. Harris R.A. Shimomura Y. Jenkins A.E. Hutson S.M. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1998; 68: 72-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 25Hutson S.M. Willin R. Hall T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15681-15688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We provide evidence that P3 cDNA is derived from BCATm by alternative splicing in human cell lines. Importantly, we show that P3 was localized not only to the mitochondria but also that a significant fraction of P3 was localized in the nucleus. The following plasmids have been described previously: pCLC51, pCLC61, and pCDMTRβ2, which express human TRβ1, TRα1, and rat TRβ2, respectively (20Yang W.M. Yao Y.L. Sun J.M. Davie J.R. Seto E. J.

Yao Y.L. Sun J.M. Davie J.R. Seto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28001-28007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar); pCJ3, pJL8, pJL5, and pCJ4, which contain full-length and truncated TRβ1 cDNA downstream of the phage T7 promoter (27Lin K.H. Parkison C. McPhie P. Cheng S.Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The pCMV-P3 plasmid, carrying both the T7 and cytomegalovirus promoters, was constructed as follows. First, a double-stranded oligonucleotide (5′-CCATGGCTCGAGGATCCGAATTCCAGATCTATGCTAGCCCTAGG-3′), containing multiple cloning sites and an ATG signal (underlined), was ligated to the pExpress-shutter vector at Nco I and Bam HI sites. Subsequently, pExp-P3 was constructed by releasing the P3 cDNA from pGAD10-P3 and subcloning it into the pExpress-shutter vector digested with Eco RI. The P3 fragment (Hin dIII-Nhe I) was cut out from the pExp-P3 vector and ligated to the Hin dIII-Nhe I site of the pCMV-TRβ1 to produce the pCMV-P3. To construct pGST-P3, P3 cDNA was isolated and cloned into theEco RI site of the pGEX-6P-1 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), in-frame with the glutathione S-transferase (GST) polypeptide. pCEP4F-P3 was generated by isolating the P3 cDNA withSal I digestion and subcloning it into the Xho I site of the pCEP4F vector to produce an in-frame fusion protein with FLAG tagged at the amino terminus. All constructions were verified by restriction enzyme digestions and DNA sequencing. The human colon carcinoma RKO cDNA library in pGAD 10 vector (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.) was constructed according to the manufacturer’s protocol (28Zhu X.G. Park K.S. Kaneshige M. Bhat M.K. Zhu Q. Mariash C.N. McPhie P. Cheng S.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2604-2618Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The full-length TRβ1 was inserted into theNde I and Eco RI site of pAS2-1 vector to generate Gal4DNA-BD-TRβ1 as the bait. Both plasmids were transformed into yeast Y190 strain and selected on histidine(−), leucine(−), and tryptophan(−) medium. After 4 days, colonies were picked and confirmed by β-galactosidase assay. The cDNA from positive clones were isolated and subjected to sequencing. Monkey kidney CV1 cells and human colon carcinoma RKO cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 μg/ml penicillin, 0.25 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine at 37 °C in 5% CO2. To prepare thyroid hormone-depleted FBS (Td-FBS), 500 ml of FBS was incubated with 20 mg/ml activated charcoal and 50 mg/ml anion exchange resin (AGX-8, Bio-Rad) for 24 h followed by centrifugation and ultrafiltration. 3 × 105 cells were seeded into a 6-well plate 1 day before transfection in DMEM with 10% Td-FBS. Cells were transfected with 1 μg of pTK-Pal-Luc, 0.25 μg of TR, and P3-expressing vector using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Empty vectors were used to supplement equal amounts of DNA in each transfection. After overnight incubation, cells were replaced with fresh DMEM with 10% Td-FBS and induced by 100 nm T3. After 24 h, cells were lysed with reporter lysis buffer (Promega) and assayed for luciferase activity and total protein. All experiments were performed in duplicates and repeated 3–5 times. The results shown are the means ± S.E. Total RNA was isolated from cell lines by RNA miniprep kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Ten μg of RNA was analyzed in 1% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde. A Northern blot containing RNA from normal human tissues was purchased from CLONTECH Laboratories. The α-32P-labeled probes were prepared by random prime kit (Stratagene). RNA was isolated from tissue culture cells by TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). The first-stranded cDNA synthesis was catalyzed by SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) using 5 μg of total RNA and poly(dT) as a primer. The target cDNA was amplified with a pair of primers: BCAT-5′ primer, 5′-ACGCCCCCGCTGAATGGTGTTATC, and BCAT-3′ primer, 5′-GTGCTGGCGTGACGAGATGCTACG. PCR was performed as follows for 35 cycles: denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C −66 °C for 30 s, and amplification at 74 °C for 30 s. The amplified products were analyzed in 3% agarose gel in TAE buffer (Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) Expression of GST, GST-TRβ1 was induced by 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside in BL21 cells. The expressed proteins were purified and immobilized by glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. In vitro translated proteins were synthesized by TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega), and the translation efficiency was verified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. For binding assay, beads were incubated with in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled proteins (intact TRβ1 and its truncated proteins lacking domain A/B, A/B +C, or A/B + C + D) (27Lin K.H. Parkison C. McPhie P. Cheng S.Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) using TNT Kit (Promega, Madison, WI) in 500 μl of buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Lubrol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% BSA, 5% glycerol, and protease inhibitors) at 4 °C overnight with constant rotation. Subsequently, beads were washed 4 times in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2.5% sucrose, 2.5 mmEDTA, 250 mm NaCl, and 1% Lubrol. The bound proteins were eluted out by boiling the beads in SDS sample buffer and analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were detected by autoradiography. The physical interaction of P3 with domain E of TRβ1 was further evaluated by co-immunoprecipitation assay. In vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled domain E (T7 expression plasmid, pCJ4) prepared similarly as described above (10 μl lysates) and P3 (10 μl lysates) were incubated in 100 μl of buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Lubrol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% BSA, 5% glycerol, and protease inhibitors) at 20 °C for 2 h. Monoclonal anti-TR antibody (mAbC4; 2 μg; 29) or an irrelevant antibody (MOPC; 2 μg; Sigma) was added and incubated for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. The mixture was further incubated with 20 μl of protein G-agarose beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were spun down and washed 4 times with buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2.5% sucrose, 2.5 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, and 1% Lubrol. The bound proteins were eluted out by boiling the beads in SDS sample buffer and analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were detected by autoradiography. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing a complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation, 300 μg of cell extract was incubated with mAbC4 (29Bhat M.K. McPhie P. Ting Y.T. Zhu X.-G. Cheng S.-Y. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10591-10599Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) or anti-FLAG M2 antibodies (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C and followed by incubation with protein G-agarose beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) overnight. Beads were washed 5 times in lysis buffer and boiled in 2× Laemmli sample buffer. The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon membranes (Millipore). The bolt was probed with mouse anti-FLAG M2 antibody, mAbC4, or a rabbit polyclonal antibody against sheep BCATm provided by Susan Hutson (from Bowman Gray School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC) (30Faure M. Glomot F. Bledsoe R.K. Hutson S.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). After washing, the reactive proteins were detected by ECL reagent (Pierce). A double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the F2-TRE-binding sequence was prepared by annealing two synthetic complementary oligomers (5′-AAGGGATCCTTATTGACCCCAGCTGAGGTCAAGTTACG-3′ and 5′-AGGAGGATCGTAACTTGACCTCAGCTGGGGTCAATAA-3′). The oligonucleotide was labeled by Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP. About 0.2 ng of probe (3–5 × 104 cpm) was incubated with in vitro translated proteins, 0.15 μg of single-stranded DNA, and 1 μg of nonspecific competitor poly(dI-dC) in 10 μl of binding buffer (10 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4% Ficoll). Full-length P3 and TRβ1 were prepared by in vitro transcription/translation kit (wheat germ TNT, Promega). Reactions were carried out at room temperature for 30 min, and complexes were resolved on 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris-HCl, 45 mm boric acid, 0.5 mm EDTA). After electrophoresis, the gel was vacuum-dried and subjected to autoradiography. To establish the specificity of the effect of P3 on the binding of TRβ1 to TRE, we also carried out EMSA similarly as described above except in the presence of bovine serum albumin (0.1–1 μg) or thein vitro translated steroid hormone co-activator-1 (1 and 4 μl) (31Xu J. Qiu Y. DeMayo F.J. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1998; 279: 1922-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar) as controls. EMSA were also carried out similarly using purified Gal repressor (GalR) and a 32P-labeled 140-bp DNA containing its target binding sequence, OI (32Majumdar A. Rudikoff S. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2326-2331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in the presence or absence of P3. CV-1 cells were seeded in Nunc chamber slides (Fisher, catalog number 2565401) with a density of 2.5 × 104 cells/well. After culturing the cells for 24 h, cells were transfected with FLAG-P3 expression plasmid (pCEPF-P3; 1 μg/well) using Fugene6 (1 μg/50 μl of Opti-MEM) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After 5 h, an equal volume of T3 (100 nm) containing medium was added to the cell cultures. After culturing the cells for 16 h, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline (three times), cells were treated with the anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) at a dilution of 1:20,000 in 5% BSA. Detection was carried out with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (20 μg/ml in 5% BSA; Jackson Laboratories). All immunofluorescence localization experiments were performed using Nunc chamber slides. Mitochondria were visualized using the Mitochondrion-selective Probe Mitotracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes) and visualized using the rhodamine channel. Cells were examined using an Ultraview Confocal microscope on a Zeiss TV200 microscope (krypton-argon laser). To search for TR-interacting proteins, a yeast two-hybrid system was used with the intact TRβ1 as bait. The screening led to the isolation of several positive clones from the human RKO cDNA library. DNA sequence analysis of one clone showed an open reading frame of 1143 bp encoding for a protein of 381 amino acids. We referred this cDNA clone as P3 (Fig.1). While searching the NCBI data base for sequence homology, we discovered that P3 is highly homologous to members of the BCATm family. Among these members, the human BCATm cDNA encodes a mature protein of 366 amino acids that is preceded by a mitochondrial targeting sequence of 27 amino acids (Fig. 1 B). DNA sequence alignment of the P3 and human BCATm (GenBankTM accession numberU68418) shows that they share 97% identity except for a 36-bp gap (corresponding to nucleotides 1030–1065 of BCATm) located near the carboxyl terminus of the P3 (Fig. 1 A). This suggests that P3 and BCATm may originate from the same gene. Analysis of the flanking sequence of the gap region revealed the consensus sequence of the 5′ and 3′ splice sites (5′-GT and AG-3′) for RNA processing. To explore further the possibility that the P3 mRNA resulted from alternative splicing of the human BCATm mRNA, we isolated total mRNA from RKO cells and synthesized the first stranded cDNA by reverse transcription. To enrich the target genes, PCR was performed using primers complementary to the flanking sequences of the gap region. Reactions were carried out at different annealing temperatures to ensure specific gene amplification. Two specific bands corresponding to the predicted sizes for the P3 (345 bp) and the BCATm (381 bp) were detected in all PCRs (Fig.2 A). Evidently, the BCATm mRNA is the dominant form in RKO cells, ∼10 times more abundant than the spliced P3 mRNA. To determine whether the splicing event occurs in other human cell lines, total mRNA isolated from human HeLa, Saco-2, MCF7, and 293 cell lines was analyzed accordingly. Similarly, BCATm mRNA was the major form, and detectable P3 mRNA was observed in these cell lines under the conditions stated (data not shown), suggesting that the splicing event is not unique in RKO cells. To explore the expression of BCATm/P3 mRNA in tissues and cultured cells, Northern blot analysis was performed using intact P3 cDNA as a probe. Whereas the P3 and BCATm mRNAs are produced by alternative splicing, they only differ 36 bp in size. As expected, only one major mRNA transcript of about 1.7 kilobase pairs was detected in all normal human tissues and cell lines. The BCATm/P3 was expressed at higher levels in human heart, placenta, skeletal muscle, and pancreas, whereas lower levels were observed in brain, lung, liver, and kidney (Fig. 2 B). A significantly higher level of BCATm/P3 was detected in human RKO cells than in rat growth hormone-producing cell (GC) and monkey CV1 cell lines. The low signal in GC and CV cells did not result from lack of sequence homology because the human BCATm shares more than 80% identity in DNA sequence with other cloned mammalian BCATm (33Bledsoe R.K. Dawson P.A. Hutson S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1339: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Because the human BCATm is highly homologous to sheep BCATm, a rabbit antiserum against mature sheep BCATm protein was used to detect the expression of BCATm and P3 (33Bledsoe R.K. Dawson P.A. Hutson S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1339: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The anti-BCATm antibody detected a 42-kDa band corresponding to the predicted size for endogenous BCATm in several human cell lines, including HeLa, 293, MCF7, RKO, Saos-2 cells, and monkey CV1 cells (Fig. 2 C, band a,lanes 1–3 and 5–7). Consistent with the results of RT-PCR and Northern blotting, BCATm and P3 were expressed more abundantly in RKO cells than in other cell lines. To demonstrate that the cloned P3 cDNA encoding a protein is antigenically related to BCATm, the P3 cDNA was cloned into the pCEP-F expression vector, which encodes a amino-terminal FLAG-tagged P3 fusion protein and transfected into CV1 cells. Surprisingly, two bands were detected by anti-BCATm antibody. The lower band co-migrated with the endogenous BCATm/P3 (band a, lanes 6 and 7) and the upper band migrates approximately at the size of 45 kDa (band b, lane 6). When the bolt was re-probed with anti-FLAG, only the upper band was detected (data not shown), suggesting that the FLAG-P3 expressed an isoform of BCATm that was not proteolytically processed in CV1 cells (Fig. 1 B). The failure of cleavage most likely results from interference of the FLAG peptide fused upstream of the mitochondrial targeting sequence (Fig.1 B). Taken together, these data confirm that P3 encodes an isoform of human BCATm and is derived from the BCATm gene by alternative splicing. P3 was identified as a TRβ1-interacting protein by the yeast two-hybrid screening. To confirm the physical interaction between P3 and TR in vitro, we used bacterially expressed GST-TRβ1 and in vitro 35S-labeled P3 in the binding assay. In agreement with the yeast two-hybrid result, P3 bound strongly to GST-TRβ1 (Fig.3 A, lanes 3 and 4) but not to GST alone (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1 and 2), indicating that the association was specific. Interestingly, addition of 1 μm T3 ligand did not disrupt the interaction between GST-TRβ1 and P3 (lane 3 versus 4). TRβ1 consists of several functional domains: the amino-terminal domain (A/B), a highly conserved DNA-binding domain (C), and a hormone-binding domain (D and E) (see also Fig. 3D of Ref. 1Cheng S.Y. Rev. Endocr. Metab. Disorders. 2000; 1: 9-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To identify the domain that is required for interaction with P3, we used in vitro translated TRβ1-truncated proteins (27Lin K.H. Parkison C. McPhie P. Cheng S.Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) in a reciprocal GST pull-down assay. All TRβ1-truncated proteins were efficiently translatedin vitro, and equal amounts these proteins were used in the binding assays. Full-length TRβ1 and all truncated TRβ1 bound to GST-P3 (Fig. 3 B, lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8) but not to GST alone (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7). These results indicate that the hormone-binding domain E is the critical binding region (see also Fig. 3 D). To further support that domain E was responsible for the binding of TRβ1 to P3, co-immunoprecipitation assay was also carried out by using anti-TR antibody, mAbC4 (29Bhat M.K. McPhie P. Ting Y.T. Zhu X.-G. Cheng S.-Y. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10591-10599Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 C shows that in the presence of both P3 and domain E (see also Fig. 3 D), P3 was associated with the immunoprecipitated domain E. Lane 4 is a control to indicate that an irrelevant monoclonal antibody, MOPC, did not precipitate any proteins. These results provide additional support to show that domain E of TRβ1 is the binding site for P3. We next determined whether P3 could associate with TRβ1 in intact cells. Thus, CV1 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding TRβ1 and FLAG-P3 in the absence of T3. TRβ1 co-precipitated with FLAG-P3 using an antibody against the FLAG epitope (Fig. 3 E, lane 3). To monitor the expression of TRβ1 and FLAG-P3, lysates from the transfected cells were analyzed by direct Western blotting (Fig.3 E, lanes 4–6). We estimated ∼2% of the expressed TR-forming complex with FLAG-P3 in CV1 cells. Similar association of FLAG-P3 with TRβ1 in CV1 c"

Med. Chem. 42, 4462-4470). The (+/-)-PPO294 racemate was resolved into its pure enantiomers, and the absolute configuration was determined by x-ray analysis. Only one enantiomer, (R)-(-)-PPO464, displayed antiviral activity against both the wild type and the K103N mutant HIV-1 RT and was found to interact exclusively with the reaction intermediate formed by RT complexed with both the DNA and the nucleotide substrates. Being the first compound of its class to display this behavior, (R)-(-)-PPO464 is the representative of a novel generation of nonnucleoside inhibitors. (R)-(-)-PPO464 showed significant synergism when tested in combination with other RT inhibitors and efficiently inhibited viral replication when tested against the laboratory strain HIV-1 IIIB or against either wild type or multidrug-resistant clinical isolates. Pharmacokinetic studies in mice and rats showed a more favorable profile for (R)-(-)-PPO464 than for the corresponding racemate. (R)-(-)-PPO464 was also found to easily cross the blood-brain barrier. The coadministration of the HIV-1 protease inhibitor ritonavir increased the bioavailability of (R)-(-)-PPO464, having little effect on its plasma and brain elimination rates."

Previous transfection studies demonstrated that factor VIII was 10–100-fold less efficiently expressed than the homologous coagulation factor, factor V. To investigate the regulatory mechanisms of FVIII synthesis and secretion, we used the yeast two-hybrid system as an approach to search for proteins that associated with FVIII. The A2 domain (337–740 amino acids) of factor VIII (FVIII-A2) was used as a bait and phytanoyl-CoA α-hydroxylase (PAHX) was identified as a binding protein of FVIII-A2. PAHX had potential to interact with the residues 373–508 within the A2 domain, but not with A1 and A3 (the homologous domains of A2). The interaction between the A2 domain and PAHX was independent of the type 2 peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS2) of PAHX. Overexpression of PAHX in FVIII-produced cells decreased the expression of FVIII by about 70%. The elevated expression of von Willebrand factor had no effect on the suppression of FVIII secretion by PAHX. Expression of the green fluorescent PAHX fusion protein in SMMC-7721 cells affected the intracellular trafficking of FVIII-A2.

The deficiency in FVIII is responsible for hemophilia A (classic hemophilia), an X-chromosome-linked bleeding disorder. During coagulation, FVIII is proteolytically cleaved by trace amounts of thrombin or factor Xa to become an unstable active heterodimeric form (FVIIIa) (1Eaton D.L. Wood W.I. Eaton D. Hass P.E. Hollingshead P. Wion K. Mather J. Lawn R.M. Vehar G.A. Gorman C. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 8343-8347Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). FVIIIa functions as a cofactor responsible for the efficient activation of factor X (FX) by the activated factor IX (FIXa) in the presence of negatively charged phospholipids and Ca2+ ion (2Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The assembly of the membrane-bound FX complex (FX·FVIIIa·FIXa) results in the release of FXa, which associates with the cofactor factor Va (FVa) and prothrombin to form the membrane-bound prothrombinase complex. Thrombin released from the complex further cleaves fibrinogen to insoluble fibrin, which stabilizes the growing clot and arrests bleeding (3Mann K.G. Lorand L. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).The gene of factor VIII is located at the tip of the long arm of the X chromosome (4Gitschier J. Wood W.I. Goralka T.M.

It spans over 180 kilobases comprising 26 exons, and is one of the largest genes known. Its transcription of a 9-kilobase mRNA product may require several hours, assuming a transcription rate of 10 nucleotides per second (4Gitschier J. Wood W.I. Goralka T.M. Wion K.L. Chen E.Y.

The factor VIII gene encodes a polypeptide chain of 2351 amino acids including a signal peptide of 19 amino acids and a mature protein of 2332 amino acids. Analysis of the deduced primary structure determined from the cloned factor VIII cDNA reveals a discrete domain structure: A1-a1-A2-a2-B-a3-A3-C1-C2 (5Vehar G.A. Keyt B. Eaton D. Rodriguez H.

These domains further display a similar extent of homology to the copper-binding protein ceruloplasmin and to factor V (FV), the cofactor in the prothrombinase complex (7Church W.R. Jernigan R.L. Toole J. Hewick R.M. Knopf J. Knutson G.J. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. Fass D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6934-6937Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The A domains are bordered by short spacers (a1, a2, and a3) that contain clusters of Asp and Glu residues, the so-called acidic regions. The C domains are structurally related to the C domains of factor V, and share amino acid sequence similarity with the lipid-binding protein lectin discoidin I, milk fat globule protein, and a putative neuronal cell adhesion molecule fromXenopus (8Stubbs J.D.

The B domain is unique in that it exhibits no significant homology with any other known proteins.Expression of FVIII in the transfection systems is 2–3 orders of magnitude lower than that observed with other genes using similar vectors and approaches. Studies on FVIII biosynthesis and secretion have been limited by the lack of human cell lines that properly express significant amounts of factor VIII. Analysis of the factor VIII secretion process has therefore been restricted to autologous gene expression (11Kaufman R.J. Pipe S.W. Tagliavacca L. Swaroop M. Moussalli M. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1997; 8 Suppl. 2: S3-14PubMed Google Scholar). There are at least three reasons for the low level expression of FVIII: 1) FVIII mRNA is inefficiently expressed (12Kaufman R.J.

Biol. 1996; 16: 4264-4272Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar); 2) a high level of von Willebrand factor, a protein that binds and stabilizes FVIII in plasma, is required in the conditioned medium to promote stable accumulation of FVIII (12Kaufman R.J. Wasley L.C. Davies M.V. Wise R.J. Israel D.I. Dorner A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1233-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 16Kaufman R.J. Wasley L.C. Dorner A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6352-6362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and 3) the primary translation product is inefficiently transported from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus (17Dorner A.J. Bole D.G. Kaufman R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2665-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In contrast to FVIII, FV is efficiently transported from ER and secreted into the medium (18Pittman D.D. Tomkinson K.N. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17329-17337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Within ER, FVIII appears to interact with a number of chaperone proteins, including calreticulin, calnexin, and the Ig-binding protein (BiP) (19Dorner A.J. Wasley L.C. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20602-20607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Marquette K.A. Pittman D.D. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 8537-8544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Due to the interaction with these chaperone proteins, a significant proportion of the factor VIII molecules are retained within ER, thereby limiting the transportation of FVIII to the Golgi apparatus. Recent studies indicated that this step involved an intracellular membrane lectin, endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment-53 (ERGIC-53) (23Nichols W.C. Seligsohn U. Zivelin A. Terry V.H. Hertel C.E. Wheatley M.A. Moussalli M.J. Hauri H.P. Ciavarella N. Kaufman R.J. Ginsburg D. Cell. 1998; 93: 61-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which FVIII is synthesized and secreted has not been fully understood.The A2 domain of FVIII (FVIII-A2) consists of ∼330 amino acids or ∼15% of the entire amino acid sequence of FVIII. A cluster of missense mutations within this region results in hemophilia A. Several reports indicated that the A2 domain is required for FVIII procoagulant activity. The thrombin-activated heterotrimer exhibited a pH-dependent dissociation of the A2 subunit from the complex that correlated with a loss in procoagulant activity (24Lollar P. Parker C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1688-1692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The difference in stability between porcine and human FVIIIa correlates with the increased affinity of the porcine A2 domain compared with the human A2 domain for the A1/A3-C1-C2 heterodimer (25Lollar P. Parker E.T. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23652-23657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The identification of cellular proteins that do interact with FVIII, physically and/or functionally, is an approach for defining the cellular functions and regulatory mechanism of FVIII. Thus, a normal human liver cDNA library was screened by using the yeast two-hybrid system (26Golemis E.A. Brent R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3006-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) with the A2 domain (337–740 aa) of FVIII as bait. PAHX (phytanoyl-CoA α-hydroxylase) was identified as a FVIII-associated protein via the A2 domain of FVIII, and its cellular roles in the expression and secretion of FVIII were also studied.DISCUSSIONThe concentration of FVIII in plasma is quite low, ranging from 100 to 200 ng/ml (34Wion K.L. Kelly D. Summerfield J.A. Tuddenham E.G. Lawn R.M. Nature. 1985; 317: 726-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The low level expression of the transfected FVIII gene was ascribed to the low level production of FVIII mRNA (34Wion K.L. Kelly D. Summerfield J.A. Tuddenham E.G. Lawn R.M. Nature. 1985; 317: 726-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and the inefficient secretion of FVIII protein due to its interaction with the protein chaperone, BiP/GRP78 (19Dorner A.J. Wasley L.C. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20602-20607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Dorner A.J. Wasley L.C. Kaufman R.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). These effects can be circumvented by using a B domain-deleted FVIII gene, which results in a marked increase in FVIII synthesis (30Mihalik S.J. Morrell J.C. Kim D. Sacksteder K.A. Watkins P.A. Gould S.J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 43Zelechowska M.G. van Mourik J.A. Brodniewicz Proba T. Nature. 1985; 317: 729-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The expressed rFVIII-ΔB remains fully functional. FVIII-ΔB can correct the cuticle bleeding time in the canine model of hemophilia A (43Zelechowska M.G. van Mourik J.A. Brodniewicz Proba T. Nature. 1985; 317: 729-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and is generally thought to be as effective as the full-length FVIII. In addition, the B domain-deleted FVIII molecule (ReFactor, FVIII-SQ) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Columbus, OH) is currently being used in European and American clinical trials for treating patients with hemophilia A. FVIII-ΔB is also a preferred molecule for the gene therapy approach because of its higher expression level. For these reasons we used FVIII-ΔB in our studies and postulated that FVIII-ΔB would traffic intracellularly in a manner analogous to the full-length FVIII.The human protein PAHX is a peroxisomal enzyme catalyzing the first step in phytanic acid oxidation: the α-oxidation of phytanoyl-CoA to α-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA. This enzyme is targeted to peroxisome by the protein PEX7, the receptor for the type 2 peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS2), an amino-terminal motif with the consensus sequence of RLX5(H/Q)L, which is prerequisite to direct proteins into the peroxisome (30Mihalik S.J.

Bioessays. 1997; 19: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The defect of PAHX results in Refsum disease, a peroxisomal disorder characterized by the accumulation of the fatty acid such as phytanic acid.Tissue expression of FVIII has also been studied through organ and tissue transplantation, which demonstrates that in human and dog FVIII is produced in the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes (37Webster W.P.

The mRNA for PAHX, however, has been found in specific tissues such as liver and kidney, but not in spleen, brain, heart, lung, and skeletal muscle (42Iwano M. Ueno S. Miyazaki M. Harada T. Nagai Y. Hirano M. Dohi Y. Akai Y. Kurioka H. Dohi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These results provide the possibility that FVIII and PAHX interact with each other in tissues such as liver.The physiological significance of the interaction between PAHX and FVIII remains to be elucidated. Interestingly, the cleavable PTS2 signal located at the NH2-terminal part of PAHX is not required for PAHX to interact with FVIII, thus the FVIII binding is unlikely involved in the recognition of the signal specific for the PTS2 receptor (PEX7). However, like other mitochondrial proteins, peroxisomal proteins are synthesized in cytoplasmic ribosome and post-translationally imported into the organelle by a process that requires Hsp70 class cytoplasmic chaperones. Intracellular FVIII is detected in association with chaperone calnexin maximally within 30 min to 1 h following synthesis, whereas FV cannot be detected in association with calnexin. In contrast, both FVIII and FV interact with calreticulin during the transition through the secretory pathway. Calnexin and calreticulin preferentially interact with glycoproteins containing monoglucosylated N-linked oligosaccharides and are supposed to transport proteins through the secretory pathway. The interaction between FVIII and these protein chaperones seems to be dependent on the B domain of FVIII (22Pipe S.W. Morris J.A. Shah J. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8537-8544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). So it would be of interest to investigate whether FVIII provides the platform for PAHX to interact with cytoplasmic chaperones.Although most evidence supports that FVIII is expressed at least in hepatocytes (34Wion K.L. Kelly D. Summerfield J.A. Tuddenham E.G. Lawn R.M. Nature. 1985; 317: 726-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 40Bontempo F.A. Lewis J.H. Gorenc T.J. Spero J.A. Ragni M.V. Scott J.P.

Haematol. 1984; 56: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the major physiological source for thein vivo expression of FVIII is still unknown. Whereas HepG2 cells are known to express FV (45Wilson D.B. Salem H.H. Mruk J.S. Maruyama I. Majerus P.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 73: 654-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), there are no known established or primary cell lines that express FVIII. Thus, our knowledge of FVIII biosynthesis is mostly derived from the expression of the FVIII cDNA in transfected mammalian cells. It is interesting to note that the inhibition of PAHX expression improves the secretion of FVIII by only 30% (Fig. 6), and the endogenetic PAHX does not change the intracellular expression of FVIII in the deposition staining pattern (Fig. 5). Considering the low-level expression of FVIII in vivo, the effect of PAHX may be taken into more account in the regulation of FVIII synthesis or secretion. Whether or not PAHX is involved in these processes is currently under investigation. Irrespective thereof, our data indicated that the secretion of FVIII into the culture medium was decreased by PAHX. Additional studies on their binding affinity and their physiological concentration in the normal and disease conditions are required for the better understanding of the biological function of this interaction.Recently, it has been reported that PAHX is deficient in three peroxisomal neurologic disorders: Zellweger syndrome, rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata, and Refsum disease (46Slawecki M.L. Dodt G. Steinberg S. Moser A.B. Moser H.W. Gould S.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1817-1829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), all result from the accumulation of phytanic acid in tissues and plasma (47Hoefler G. Hoefler S. Watkins P.A. Chen W.W. Moser A.

Mihalik S.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 337: 133-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that PAHX interacts with the FKBP12-like domain of FKBP52 in the presence of FK506. Thus, PAHX is potentially involved in the cellular signal transmission by FKBP52 in the presence of FK506, in a manner comparable to the calcineurin-FKBP12 complex (50Chambraud B. Radanyi C. Camonis J.H. Rajkowski K. Schumacher M. Baulieu E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2104-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The diversity of PAHX function in these reports suggests that the physiological role of PAHX has not been fully understood. Our results indicated that the overexpression of PAHX in FVIII-ΔB produced cells not only decreased the FVIII secretion into the culture media, but also changed the intracellular distribution of FVIII-A2. FVIII is synthesized in cells and secrete into the plasma to be a member of coagulation cascade. PAHX is a peroxisomal protein, which should be targeted into peroxisome by the PTS2 signal. The interaction between PAHX and FVIII is independent of PTS2, but the effect of PAHX on FVIII expression is dependent on PTS2. The function of PAHX demonstrated in this report is somewhat like protein chaperones, BiP and calnexin, which regulate the secretion of FVIII (22Pipe S.W. Morris J.A. Shah J. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8537-8544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It is speculated that PAHX functions as a protein chaperone, interacting with the A2 domain of FVIII and retarding FVIII in the secretory pathway. Thus, the amount of FVIII is decreased in the culture medium.In conclusion, PAHX is another specific binding protein for human coagulation factor VIII. Overexpression of PAHX changes the intracellular distribution of FVIII-A2 and decreases the expression of FVIII. However, it is still too early to conclude that this physical interaction is important to the physiological effect of FVIII in vivo. Further studies on this newly identified FVIII-associated protein are required for a better understanding of its physiological role. Coagulation factor VIII (FVIII)1 is an essential protein in blood coagulation. The deficiency in FVIII is responsible for hemophilia A (classic hemophilia), an X-chromosome-linked bleeding disorder. During coagulation, FVIII is proteolytically cleaved by trace amounts of thrombin or factor Xa to become an unstable active heterodimeric form (FVIIIa) (1Eaton D.L. Wood W.I. Eaton D. Hass P.E. Hollingshead P. Wion K. Mather J. Lawn R.M. Vehar G.A. Gorman C. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 8343-8347Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). FVIIIa functions as a cofactor responsible for the efficient activation of factor X (FX) by the activated factor IX (FIXa) in the presence of negatively charged phospholipids and Ca2+ ion (2Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The assembly of the membrane-bound FX complex (FX·FVIIIa·FIXa) results in the release of FXa, which associates with the cofactor factor Va (FVa) and prothrombin to form the membrane-bound prothrombinase complex. Thrombin released from the complex further cleaves fibrinogen to insoluble fibrin, which stabilizes the growing clot and arrests bleeding (3Mann K.G. Lorand L. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The gene of factor VIII is located at the tip of the long arm of the X chromosome (4Gitschier J. Wood W.I. Goralka T.M. Wion K.L. Chen E.Y. Eaton D.H. Vehar G.A. Capon D.J. Lawn R.M. Nature. 1984; 312: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). It spans over 180 kilobases comprising 26 exons, and is one of the largest genes known. Its transcription of a 9-kilobase mRNA product may require several hours, assuming a transcription rate of 10 nucleotides per second (4Gitschier J. Wood W.I. Goralka T.M. Wion K.L. Chen E.Y. Eaton D.H. Vehar G.A. Capon D.J. Lawn R.M. Nature. 1984; 312: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). The factor VIII gene encodes a polypeptide chain of 2351 amino acids including a signal peptide of 19 amino acids and a mature protein of 2332 amino acids. Analysis of the deduced primary structure determined from the cloned factor VIII cDNA reveals a discrete domain structure: A1-a1-A2-a2-B-a3-A3-C1-C2 (5Vehar G.A. Keyt B. Eaton D. Rodriguez H. O'Brien D.P. Rotblat F. Oppermann H. Keck R. Wood W.I. Harkins R.N. Tuddenham E.G.D. Lawn R.M. Capon D.J. Nature. 1984; 312: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 6Toole J.J. Knopf J.L.

Nature. 1984; 312: 342-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). The A domains (A1, A2, and A3) share ∼30% homology to each other. These domains further display a similar extent of homology to the copper-binding protein ceruloplasmin and to factor V (FV), the cofactor in the prothrombinase complex (7Church W.R. Jernigan R.L. Toole J. Hewick R.M. Knopf J. Knutson G.J. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. Fass D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6934-6937Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The A domains are bordered by short spacers (a1, a2, and a3) that contain clusters of Asp and Glu residues, the so-called acidic regions. The C domains are structurally related to the C domains of factor V, and share amino acid sequence similarity with the lipid-binding protein lectin discoidin I, milk fat globule protein, and a putative neuronal cell adhesion molecule fromXenopus (8Stubbs J.D.

Neuron. 1991; 7: 295-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The B domain is unique in that it exhibits no significant homology with any other known proteins. Expression of FVIII in the transfection systems is 2–3 orders of magnitude lower than that observed with other genes using similar vectors and approaches. Studies on FVIII biosynthesis and secretion have been limited by the lack of human cell lines that properly express significant amounts of factor VIII. Analysis of the factor VIII secretion process has therefore been restricted to autologous gene expression (11Kaufman R.J. Pipe S.W. Tagliavacca L. Swaroop M. Moussalli M. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1997; 8 Suppl. 2: S3-14PubMed Google Scholar). There are at least three reasons for the low level expression of FVIII: 1) FVIII mRNA is inefficiently expressed (12Kaufman R.J.

Biol. 1996; 16: 4264-4272Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar); 2) a high level of von Willebrand factor, a protein that binds and stabilizes FVIII in plasma, is required in the conditioned medium to promote stable accumulation of FVIII (12Kaufman R.J. Wasley L.C. Davies M.V. Wise R.J. Israel D.I. Dorner A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1233-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 16Kaufman R.J. Wasley L.C. Dorner A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6352-6362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and 3) the primary translation product is inefficiently transported from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus (17Dorner A.J. Bole D.G. Kaufman R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2665-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In contrast to FVIII, FV is efficiently transported from ER and secreted into the medium (18Pittman D.D. Tomkinson K.N. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17329-17337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Within ER, FVIII appears to interact with a number of chaperone proteins, including calreticulin, calnexin, and the Ig-binding protein (BiP) (19Dorner A.J. Wasley L.C. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20602-20607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Marquette K.A. Pittman D.D. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 8537-8544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Due to the interaction with these chaperone proteins, a significant proportion of the factor VIII molecules are retained within ER, thereby limiting the transportation of FVIII to the Golgi apparatus.
