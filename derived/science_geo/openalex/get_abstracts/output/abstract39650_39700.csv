https://openalex.org/W1498162448,"Phosphoinositide breakdown has been linked to the receptor mechanism involved in the elevation of cytosolic Ca2+. In a cell-free system prepared from [3H] inositol-labeled blowfly salivary glands, 5-hydroxytryptamine stimulated the rapid production of inositol phosphates. Within 30 s of hormone addition, there was a 100% increase in inositol trisphosphate formation, a 70% increase in inositol bisphosphate formation, and a 90% increase in inositol monophosphate formation as compared to control homogenates incubated for the same length of time. 5-Hydroxytryptamine did not stimulate inositol or glycerol phosphoinositol formation. Half-maximal activation of inositol phosphate production was obtained with 0.33 microM 5-hydroxytryptamine. Ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N',N',N',N'-tetraacetic acid, (EGTA) (0.3 mM) inhibited the basal formation of inositol phosphates and decreased the net accumulation of inositol bisphosphate and inositol trisphosphate due to hormone as compared to homogenates incubated in the absence of added Ca2+. EGTA, however, had little effect on the per cent stimulation of inositol phosphate production due to hormone. In homogenates, ATP, GTP or guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p) was required for a hormone effect. Gpp(NH)p, unlike ATP or GTP, increased the basal formation of inositol phosphates. In membranes, GTP, Gpp(NH)p, or guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)trisphosphate (GTP gamma S) sustained a hormone effect whereas ATP was ineffective. GTP did not affect production while Gpp(NH)p and GTP gamma S increased inositol phosphate production. Half-maximal effects of Gpp(NH)p and GTP gamma S on hormone-stimulated inositol phosphate formation occurred at 10 microM and 100 nM, respectively. In the presence of 1 microM GTP gamma S, 5-methyltryptamine stimulated inositol phosphate formation within 2 s in membranes. These results indicate that in a cell-free system, GTP is involved in mediating the effects of Ca2+-mobilizing hormones on phosphoinositide breakdown."
https://openalex.org/W1569602839,"In cultured human 1321N1 astrocytoma cells, muscarinic receptor stimulation leads to phosphoinositide hydrolysis, formation of inositol phosphates, and mobilization of intracellular Ca2+. Treatment of these cells with 1 microM 4 beta-phorbol 12 beta-myristate 13 alpha-acetate (PMA) completely blocks the carbachol-stimulated formation of [3H]inositol mono-, bis-, and trisphosphate ( [3H]InsP, [3H]InsP2, and [3H]InsP3). The concentrations of PMA that give half-maximal and 100% inhibition of carbachol-induced [3H]InsP formation are 3 nM and 0.5 microM, respectively. Inactive phorbol esters (4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate and 4 beta-phorbol), at 1 microM, do not inhibit carbachol-stimulated [3H]InsP formation. The KD of the muscarinic receptor for [3H]N-methyl scopolamine is unchanged by PMA treatment, while the IC50 for carbachol is modestly increased. PMA treatment also abolishes carbachol-induced 45Ca2+ efflux from 1321N1 cells. The concomitant loss of InsP3 formation and Ca2+ mobilization is strong evidence in support of a causal relationship between these two responses. In addition, our finding that PMA blocks hormone-stimulated phosphoinositide turnover suggests that there may be feedback regulation of phosphoinositide metabolism through the Ca2+- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1582735722,"Effects of angiotensin II and [Arg]vasopressin on cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and phosphoinositide metabolism were studied in cultured aortic smooth muscle cells obtained from Wistar-Kyoto rats and their spontaneously hypertensive substrain. [Ca2+]i was measured using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator quin2. No clear differences in basal [Ca2+]i were detected between cells derived from the two strains. High concentrations of angiotensin II (greater than or equal to 10 nM) and [Arg]vasopressin (greater than or equal to 100 nM) elicited large and rapid increases in [Ca2+]i, followed by a rapid return to control values. Low concentrations of these peptides (less than or equal to 1.0 nM) elicited small and slow increases in [Ca2+]i that persisted for minutes. These responses were blocked by specific antagonists for each of these peptides. Only high concentrations of angiotensin II caused [Ca2+]i increases in medium, which suggested that high concentrations of angiotensin II could release Ca2+ from intracellular pools. A high concentration of angiotensin II and [Arg]vasopressin elicited progressive accumulations of inositol phosphates. Only high concentrations of angiotensin II caused inositol phosphate accumulation in Ca2+-free medium. Maximal accumulation of inositol phosphate elicited by angiotensin II and [Arg]vasopressin was found to be additive. A desensitization to the effects of both peptides on Ca2+ mobilization occurred despite the continued accumulation of inositol phosphates. These observations indicated that angiotensin II and [Arg]vasopressin interacted with independent receptors, both of which are linked to phosphoinositide breakdown and Ca2+ mobilization."
https://openalex.org/W1566158288,"Amino-terminal processing in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been investigated by examining numerous mutationally altered forms of iso-1-cytochrome c. Amino-terminal residues of methionine were retained in sequences having penultimate residues of arginine, asparagine, glutamine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, and methionine; in contrast, the amino-terminal methionine residues were exercised from residues of alanine, glycine, and threonine and were partially excised from residues of valine. The results suggest the occurrence of a yeast aminopeptidase that removes amino-terminal residues of methionine when they precede certain amino acids. A systematic search of the literature for amino-terminal sequences formed at initiation sites suggests the hypothetical yeast aminopeptidase usually has the same specificity as the amino peptidase from bacteria and higher eukaryotes. Our results and the results from the literature search suggest that the aminopeptidase cleaves amino-terminal methionine when it precedes residues of alanine, glycine, proline, serine, threonine, and valine but not when it precedes residues of arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, glutamine glutamic acid, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, or methionine. In contrast to the normal iso-1-cytochrome c and in contrast to the majority of the mutationally altered proteins, certain forms were acetylated including the following sequences: acetyl(Ac)-Met-Ile-Arg-, Ac-Met-Ile-Lys, Ac-Met-Met-Asn-, and Ac-Met-Asn-Asn-. We suggest yeast contains acetyltransferases that acetylates these mutant forms of iso-1-cytochromes c because their amino-terminal regions resemble the amino-terminal regions of natural occurring proteins which are normally acetylated. The lack of acetylation of closely related sequences suggest that the hypothetical acetyltransferases are specific for certain amino-terminal sequences and that the 3 amino-terminal residues may play a critical role in determining these specificities."
https://openalex.org/W1585949174,"The enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EC 2.5.1.19), encoded by the aroA locus, is a target site of glyphosate inhibition in bacteria. A glyphosate-resistant aroA allele has been cloned in Escherichia coli from a mutagenized strain of Salmonella typhimurium. Subcloning of this mutant aroA allele shows the gene to reside on a 1.3-kilobase segment of S. typhimurium DNA. Nucleotide sequence analysis of this mutant gene indicates a protein-coding region 427 amino acids in length. Comparison of the mutant and wild type aroA gene sequences reveals a single base pair change resulting in a Pro to Ser amino acid substitution at the 101st codon of the protein. A hybrid gene fusion between mutant and wild type aroA gene sequences was constructed. 5-Enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase was prepared from E. coli cells harboring this construct. The glyphosate-resistant phenotype is shown to be associated with the single amino acid substitution described above."
https://openalex.org/W1593235330,"Both normal chicken calmodulin (CaM) and a CaM-like mutant protein have been expressed in bacteria, isolated and evaluated with respect to several physical and biological properties. The mutant CaM is derived from a CaM-like gene that lacks intervening sequences and probably evolved from a CaM-processed gene (Stein, J. P., Munjaal, R. P., Lagace, L., Lai, E. C., O'Malley, B. W., and Means, A. R. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 80, 6485-6489). The mutant CaM protein contains 16 of the 19 amino acids encoded by the CaM-like gene. Normal chicken CaM produced in bacteria is identical to rat CaM by all criteria tested except that it is not trimethylated. The protein product of the CaM-like gene has been termed CaML and exhibits properties which are very similar to CaM despite the presence of 16 amino acid substitutions. CaML binds Ca2+ as evidenced by Ca2+-dependent binding to phenothiazine- and phenyl-Sepharose affinity resins and a Ca2+-dependent electrophoretic mobility shift which is similar to but distinct from CaM. CaML cross-reacts with a monospecific CaM antibody and has an immunodilution curve which is identical to bacterially synthesized CaM. Finally, CaML can maximally activate rat brain phosphodiesterase but with altered kinetic parameters as compared to CaM. These data suggest that the nucleotide substitutions in the putative CaM processed gene are not random but are selected to retain CaM-like functions in the encoded protein. Such a mechanism may exist for other processed genes."
https://openalex.org/W1596449567,"In human foreskin fibroblast cultures, two proteins with Mr 60,000 and 55,000 were found to be induced about 3.5-fold by epidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet-derived growth factor, and beta-transforming growth factor. The induced proteins were identified as procollagenases by immunoprecipitation of induced medium with antibodies to purified human fibroblast collagenase. Collagenase enzyme activity in the medium from EGF-treated cultures was also induced at least 3-fold compared to control cultures. Induction of collagenase was dependent upon de novo protein and RNA synthesis and was observed in the medium 10 h after addition of EGF. Although these growth-promoting factors interact with separate membrane receptors, each induced the secretion of a common protein, suggesting that collagenase may be important in some aspect of mitogenesis, cell mobilization, and migration."
https://openalex.org/W1491178385,"We previously reported that, in a HCO3(-)-free medium, cytoplasmic pH (pHi) of hamster fibroblasts (CCL39) is primarily regulated by an amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+ antiport (L'Allemain, G., Paris, S., and Pouyssegur, J. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 5809-5815). Here we demonstrate the existence of an additional pHi-regulating mechanism in CCL39 cells, namely a Na+-dependent HCO3-/Cl- exchange. Evidence for this system is based on 36Cl- influx studies and on pHi measurements in PS120, a CCL39-derived mutant lacking the Na+/H+ antiport activity. 36Cl- influx rate is a saturable function of external [Cl-] (apparent Km approximately equal to 7 mM), is competitively inhibited by external HCO3- (KI approximately equal to 3 mM), and by stilbene derivatives (KI approximately equal to 20 microM for 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid). Measurements of pHi recovery after an acute acid load indicate that PS120 cells possess an acid-extruding mechanism dependent on external HCO3-, which is inhibited by stilbene derivatives and requires external Na+. Since 22Na+ influx is stimulated upon addition of HCO3- to acid-loaded cells and this effect is completely abolished by 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid, we conclude that Na+ is co-transported with HCO3-, in exchange for intracellular Cl-. In a HCO3(-)-containing medium, this pHi-regulating mechanism appears to have two essential physiological functions for the Na+/H+ antiport-deficient mutant: protection of the cells against excessive cytoplasmic acidification and establishment of a steady-state pHi permissive for growth, at neutral or slightly acidic pHo values (6.6-7.2)."
https://openalex.org/W86039670,"We investigated systematically the knotting of nicked circular duplex DNA by Escherichia coli topoisomerase I. Agarose gel electrophoresis of knots forms a ladder of DNA bands. Each rung is made up of a variety of knots with the same number of nodes, or segment crossings; knots in adjacent rungs differ by one node. We extended the technique of electron microscopy of recA protein-coated DNA to the visualization of the complex knots tied by topoisomerase I. The striking result is that the enzyme produces every knot theoretically possible. The requirement for excess enzyme to form complex knots suggests a role for topoisomerase I in contorting the DNA in addition to promoting strand passage. We conclude that nodes formed are equally likely to be positive or negative and that topoisomerase I can pass DNA strands through a transient enzyme-generated break without regard to orientation of the passing strand. The results are interpreted in terms of a formulation for the topological requirements for knotting."
https://openalex.org/W1495218540,"Ubiquitinated histones uH2A.1, uH2A.Z, and uH2B have been identified in the basic nuclear proteins of the slime mold Physarum polycephalum by three methods: peptide mapping, cross-reaction with anti-ubiquitin antibody, and uH2A and uH2B isopeptidase cleavage. In microplasmodia, uH2A amounts to 7% of H2A and uH2B amounts to 6% of H2B. Detailed studies of mitosis in Physarum polycephalum macroplasmodia show that in early prophase, which last 15 min, the uH2As and uH2B are both strongly present, whereas minutes later in metaphase, which lasts 7 min, they disappear. When the nuclei enter anaphase, which lasts 3 min, both the uH2As and uH2B reappear. These precise studies suggest that cleavage of ubiquitin from the uH2As and uH2B is a very late, possibly final event in chromosome condensation to metaphase chromosomes and that ubiquitination is an early event in their decondensation. It is proposed that the uH2A and uH2B mark specific regions of the genome which have to be deubiquitinated prior to packaging into metaphase chromosomes; after metaphase these regions are the first to be decondensed and ubiquitinated. This modification, however, is not thought to be a general factor in chromosome condensation but labels a specific subcomponent of chromatin containing the expressed genes of a particular cell type or an important subset of these genes required by the cell to be available for activation, e.g. stress genes."
https://openalex.org/W1510594184,"The Escherichia coli gene for folylpolyglutamate synthetase-dihydrofolate synthetase was localized to plasmids pLC22-45, 24-31, and 28-44 of the Clarke-Carbon E. coli colony bank (Clarke, L., and Carbon, J. (1976) Cell 9, 91-99) by screening the bank by replica mating with an E. coli folC mutant. The folC gene was subcloned from pLC22-45 and inserted into a high copy number plasmid containing the lambda replication control region under the control of the temperature-sensitive cI857 repressor and into a high expression plasmid containing the lambda PL promoter and the cI857 repressor. The folC structural gene was located on a 1.52-kilobase PvuI fragment, sufficient to code for a protein of maximum Mr 55,000. E. coli transformants containing the recombinant plasmids, when induced by culturing at 42 degrees C, had folylpolyglutamate synthetase and dihydrofolate synthetase levels that were 100- to 400-fold higher than in wild type strains and which represented up to 4% of the soluble cell protein. The E. coli folylpolyglutamate synthetase-dihydrofolate synthetase has been purified to homogeneity from the transformants. Both activities are catalyzed by a single protein of Mr 47,000. Some kinetic properties of the enzymes and a new spectrophotometric method for assaying dihydrofolate synthetase activity are described."
https://openalex.org/W1508536142,"The rat cytochrome P-450d gene which is inducibly expressed by the administration of 3-methylcholanthrene (MC) has been cloned and analyzed for the complete nucleotide sequence. The gene is 6.9 kilobases long and is separated into 7 exons by 6 introns. The insertion sites of the introns in this gene are well-conserved as compared with those of another MC-inducible cytochrome P-450c gene, but are completely different from those of a phenobarbital-inducible cytochrome P-450e gene. The overall homologies in the coding nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences were 75% and 68% between the two MC-inducible cytochrome P-450 genes, respectively. The similarity of the gene organization between cytochrome P-450d and P-450c as well as their homology in the deduced amino acid and the nucleotide sequences suggests that these two genes of MC-inducible cytochromes P-450 constitute a different subfamily than those of the phenobarbital-inducible one in the cytochrome P-450 gene family. In contrast with the notable sequence homology in the coding region of the two MC-inducible cytochromes P-450, all the introns and the 5'- and 3'-flanking regions of the two genes showed virtually no sequence homology between them except for several short DNA segments that are located in the promoter region and the first intron. The nucleotide sequences and the locations of these conserved short DNA segments in the two genes suggest that they may affect the expression of the genes. Middle repetitive sequence reported as ID or identifier sequence were found in and in the vicinity of the cytochrome P-450d gene."
https://openalex.org/W1488985346,"Inhibition of protein synthesis superinduces transcription of the cytochrome P1-450 gene in Hepa 1c1c7 mouse hepatoma cells. The superinduced transcription rate is 10-15-fold higher than the maximal rate of transcription induced by the known inducer 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) alone. Superinduction is maximal within 30-40 min and remains maximal for at least 90 min. Cytochrome P1-450 mRNA is the same length in TCDD-induced and superinduced cells. Superinduction does not occur in variant cells in which TCDD-receptor complexes bind weakly to nuclei and which do not transcribe the cytochrome P1-450 gene in response to TCDD. Inhibition of protein synthesis does not alter several properties of TCDD-receptor complexes. The results imply that a second control mechanism modulates the action of the TCDD-receptor complex in regulating cytochrome P1-450 gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1537978981,"The structural requirements for diacylglycerols to mimic the action of tumor-promoting phorbol diesters on the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor of A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells were investigated. Five biological effects were considered: inhibition of high affinity 125I-EGF binding, change in the phosphorylation state of the EGF receptor, inhibition of the EGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor, inhibition of [3H]phorbol 12 beta, 13 alpha-dibutyrate binding, and stimulation of calcium- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (C-kinase) in vitro. A marked effect of the acyl chain length, 3-10 carbons, of symmetric sn-1,2-diacylglycerols was observed on their ability to mimic the effect of 4 beta-phorbol 12 beta-myristate 13 alpha-acetate (PMA). sn-1,2-Dipropanoylglycerol did not mimic the effects of PMA, but sn-1,2-didecanoylglycerol potently mimicked PMA action. A correlation was found between the ability of these diacylglycerols to stimulate the activity of C-kinase in vitro and to mimic the effects of PMA on the EGF receptor in intact cells. Analogues of sn-1,2-dioctanoylglycerol in which the 3' hydroxyl group was substituted with hydrogen, thio or chloro moieties were inactive when assayed for their ability to stimulate C-kinase in vitro and mimic PMA action in intact cells. We conclude that the hydroxyl group of a diacylglycerol is vital for the interaction with the phorbol diester receptor. The stringent correlation between the potency of the 11 diacylglycerol analogues tested to modulate C-kinase in vitro and to mimic PMA action in vivo provides strong evidence for the hypothesis that C-kinase plays a central role in the regulation of A431 cell EGF receptors by tumor-promoting phorbol diesters."
https://openalex.org/W1569916926,"We have purified the epidermal growth factor receptor/kinase from A431 membrane vesicles which had been affinity labeled with the ATP analog, 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl[8-14C]adenosine. The resulting purified, affinity labeled receptor/kinase preparation has been subjected to reduction and carboxymethylation followed by tryptic digestion. From this digest, we have isolated and sequenced the tryptic peptide containing the major site of labeling by the ATP analog. The sequence of this peptide is Ile-Pro-Val-Ala-Ile-X-Glu-Leu, where X corresponds to Lys 721 of the derived sequence of the EGF receptor/kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1545046786,"The interaction of three different c-type cytochromes with flavodoxin has been studied by computer graphics modelling and computational methods. Flavodoxin and each cytochrome can make similar hypothetical electron transfer complexes that are characterized by nearly coplanar arrangement of the prosthetic groups, close intermolecular contacts at the protein-protein interface, and complementary intermolecular salt linkages. Computation of the electrostatic free energy of each complex showed that all were electrostatically stable. However, both the magnitude and behavior of the electrostatic stabilization as a function of solution ionic strength differed for the three cytochrome c-flavodoxin complexes. Variation in the computed electrostatic stabilization appears to reflect differences in the surface distribution of all charged groups in the complex, rather than differences localized at the site of intermolecular contact. The computed electrostatic association constants for the complexes and the measured kinetic rates of electron transfer in solution show a remarkable similarity in their ionic strength dependence. This correlation suggests electrostatic interactions influence electron transfer rates between protein molecules at the intermolecular association step. Comparative calculations for the three cytochrome c-flavodoxin complexes show that these ionic strength effects also involve all charged groups in both redox partners."
https://openalex.org/W1515015207,"Kinetoplast DNA is a network containing thousands of interlocked minicircles. The minicircles replicate as free molecules after release from the network, and their progeny are then reattached (Englund, P. T., (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 4895-4900). In Trypanosoma equiperdum, some of the newly replicated minicircles which have recatenated to the network contain a single gap. This gap is about 10 nucleotides in size and it is in the newly synthesized strand. Based on several criteria (S1 nuclease digestion, denaturing polyacrylamide gel analysis and DNA sequencing), the gap residues at a unique site on the molecule. This site overlaps the sequence GGGGTTGGTGTAA, which is the only common sequence found in all minicircles, from several different species, which have been examined."
https://openalex.org/W1523951968,"The low molecular weight polypeptide required for energy-dependent proteolysis, ubiquitin, is rapidly inactivated by 100,000 X g supernatants of rabbit liver extracts. Ubiquitin inactivation results from limited proteolysis by an endogenous contaminating lysosomal thiol protease having trypsin-like specificity. Evidence for this includes a pH optimum of 5.0 for the first order constant of ubiquitin inactivation and observation that inactivation is inhibited by EDTA, o-phenanthroline, iodoacetamide, p-chloromercuribenzoic acid, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, N alpha-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone, leupeptin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and aprotinin. Metals stimulate but are not required for ubiquitin inactivation with the effect apparently mediated by a low molecular weight heat-labile component of crude extracts. When this heat-labile component is removed by gel exclusion chromatography a number of metals inhibit ubiquitin inactivation. In the presence of excess dithiothreitol, inhibition is relatively specific for Zn(II). Inhibition by Zn(II) is specifically overcome competitively by Cd(II) or by a concentration of ubiquitin in excess of Zn(II). The responsible cathepsin possesses a molecular mass of 35 kDa by gel exclusion chromatography and shows marked thermal lability at neutral pH but stability at acid pH. Proteolytic inactivation of ubiquitin results from limited cleavage of the carboxyl-terminal glycine dipeptide required for isopeptide bond formation and is supported by data on isoelectric point changes on subsequent digestion with carboxypeptidase B and by direct amino acid analysis. When the responsible cathepsin is inactivated, liver extracts display ATP,ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis that cannot be ascribed to contaminating erythrocytes. Thus the previous inability to demonstrate energy-dependent proteolysis in liver extracts is accounted for by the artifactual inactivation of ubiquitin."
https://openalex.org/W1658336926,"Abstract When normal human fibroblasts are brought to a steady state with 125I-labeled epidermal growth factor (125I-EGF), greater than 90% of the radioactivity is intracellular. We investigated this material to determine whether the is intact or degraded. Our results show that is rapidly processed after internalization and can be resolved into four peaks by native gel electrophoresis. These different forms were isolated and tested for their ability to bind to cell-surface EGF receptors. The first processed form was fully capable of binding to EGF receptors, but the second processed form could not. The third form was a collection of small products. We calculated that at steady state about 60% of internalized 125I-EGF was in a form still able to bind to EGF receptors. We then investigated the ability of different reported inhibitors of EGF degradation to block the processing of EGF. Although inhibitors of cathepsin B (leupeptin, antipain, N alpha-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone, and chymostatin) were able to inhibit the release of monoiodotyrosine from treated cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, they had little effect on the processing step that apparently inactivates 125I-EGF. In contrast, agents that raised intravesicular pH, such as methylamine and monensin, inhibited the initial steps in EGF processing as well as the later steps. Low temperatures inhibited the transfer of to the lysosomes and inhibited the conversion of EGF to a nonbindable form, but had little effect on the initial processing. We conclude that the intracellular processing of EGF is a multistep process that is initiated prior to lysosomal fusion, involves cathepsin B activity, and requires an acidic pH. In addition, many of the protease inhibitors that have been utilized to investigate the role of EGF in mitogenesis do not block the conversion of EGF to a form that is apparently unable to interact with its receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2131097094,"Calmodulin purified from Dictyostelium discoideum is selectively degraded by rabbit reticulocyte extracts in the presence of ubiquitin and ATP. This protein forms a 1:1 covalent conjugate with ubiquitin. Analyses of the cyanogen bromide fragments of the protein conjugate indicate that lysine 115 on calmodulin is the ubiquitin conjugation site. Bovine brain calmodulin which contains a trimethyllysine residue at this position is not a substrate for conjugation with ubiquitin, and its degradation rate is not affected by ATP and ubiquitin. These results suggest that the trimethyllysine residue in mammalian calmodulin may function in protecting the protein from degradation by the ATP, ubiquitin-dependent pathway. Since there are eight lysine residues in Dictyostelium calmodulin, the specific conjugation of ubiquitin to lysine 115 may provide a good model system to delineate the structural features required for the conjugation and to follow the degradative steps in the pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1489472319,"Proteolytic activities in bovine adrenocortical mitochondria were investigated using [14C-methyl]casein as a substrate. Washed mitochondria showed a low proteolytic activity at pH 7.5 or 8.2. ATP (5 mM) plus MgCl2 (7.5 mM) stimulated the proteolysis 9 times at pH 8.2. It was further demonstrated unequivocally by various approaches that the ATP-dependent proteolytic activity localizes in mitochondrial matrix. The activity of the solubilized protease was sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide, mersalyl acid, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, o-vanadate, m-vanadate, vanadyl sulfate, and quercetin but not by oligomycin and ouabain. The ATP-dependent proteolytic activity was eluted at the position of 650,000 daltons on an Ultrogel AcA 22 column as a single symmetrical peak. The gel-filtered enzyme showed high specificity to ATP. GTP and UTP partially substituted ATP. ADP, AMP, tripolyphosphate, alpha, beta-methylene ATP, and beta, gamma-methylene ATP had little or no stimulating activity. ATP did not stimulate the activity in the absence of MgCl2. We measured ATP-dependent proteolytic activities in mitochondrial fractions from several tissues in rat and bovine. Adrenal cortex was one of the tissues of highest activity. In addition, we investigated the effect of adrenal atrophy on the ATP-dependent protease activity in rat adrenal. The ATP-dependent protease activity/adrenal decreased by dexamethasone treatment. The extent of the decrease was similar to that of cytochrome oxidase and succinate dehydrogenase, but smaller than that of cytochrome P-450."
https://openalex.org/W1497159330,"A monoclonal antibody to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor of A431 cells, denoted 2D1-IgM, was generated after fusion of immunized BALB/c mouse spleen cells with SP2/0-Ag14 myeloma cells. Specific binding of 2D1-IgM to the A431 cell-surface receptor for EGF was demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblot analysis. Scatchard analysis of 125I-EGF binding to A431 cells demonstrated that 2D1-IgM treatment did not change the number of EGF receptors, but caused an increase in the affinity of EGF receptors from a population of low affinity to a uniform population of high affinity. Like EGF, 2D1-IgM induced phosphorylation of EGF receptors and EGF receptor clustering. As in the case of EGF, a biphasic growth response with stimulation of DNA synthesis at low and inhibition at high concentrations of 2D1-IgM was evident in A431 cells. The intrinsic bioactivity of 2D1-IgM was enhanced by the presence of EGF. These results suggest that the binding of 2D1-IgM to the EGF receptor at a different site from that to which EGF binds can initiate an effective EGF-like biological response; and the EGF-like biological effects of 2D1-IgM may be mediated by a population of high affinity EGF receptors which may be involved in the control of cellular growth."
https://openalex.org/W1558039847,"Vertebrates possess three isozyme forms of fructose diphosphate aldolase. We have isolated two overlapping chicken genomic clones which encode the liver-specific form of this enzyme; we have identified the 5' and 3' ends of this gene by a combination of primer extension analysis and S1 mapping; and we have determined the entire nucleotide sequence of this gene including 1400 base pairs (bp) of sequence from the regions flanking the 5' and 3' ends of the gene. The transcriptional unit for the aldolase B gene spans 8700 bp and contains eight intervening sequences, including a 4600-bp intron in the 5' non-coding region. On the basis of results from Southern genomic hybridizations, the aldolase B gene appears to be present only once per haploid genome. No differences were detected in the mRNA structure between RNA from three tissues expressing aldolase B (liver, kidney, and small intestine). Various features of the 5' flanking region are discussed, including a partial homology with the 5' noncoding region from rabbit aldolase A."
https://openalex.org/W1561346813,"We studied the interaction between topoisomerase I and a nicked DNA substrate to determine how the nick permits Escherichia coli topoisomerase I to catenate and knot duplex DNA rings. The presence of just a single nick in a 6600-base pair DNA increased the amount of DNA bound to topoisomerase I by 6-fold. The enzyme acts at the nick, as shown by linearization of nicked circles and covalent attachment of an enzyme molecule opposite the nick. DNA breaks are also introduced by the enzyme at sites not opposite to a nick, but three orders of magnitude less efficiently. The break induced by the enzyme is within several base pairs of the nick and on the complementary strand, but the exact site cut is dictated by DNA sequence requirements. Because these sequence requirements are identical to those for cutting of single-stranded DNA, we conclude that the enzyme stabilizes a denatured region at the nick. Breaks in single-stranded DNA occur 98% of the time when a C residue is four bases to the 5' side unless G is adjacent and 5' to the break. For a DNA circle nicked at a unique location, the efficiency of DNA breakage opposite the nick correlates with the rate of catenation. We present a unified model for the relaxation, catenation, and knotting reactions of topoisomerase I in which the enzyme induces a break in a single-stranded region, but bridges that break with covalent and noncovalent interactions and allows passage of one duplex or single-stranded DNA segment."
https://openalex.org/W1591316649,"Electron microscopic examination of DNA intermediates formed by the restriction endonuclease of Escherichia coli B revealed supercoiled loops that are presumably formed during an ATP-dependent DNA translocation process in which the enzyme remains bound to the recognition site while tracking along the DNA helix to a cleavage site. The rate of DNA translocation during this process is at least 5000 base pairs/min at 37 degrees C. Even after all cleavages have been completed, complexes are seen that contain terminal loops or loop plus tail structures. During this later phase of the reaction, ATP is hydrolyzed at a rate which is dependent upon the size of the largest possible loop (or loop plus tail); this ATP hydrolysis can be terminated by one double-strand cleavage within the loop region between the recognition site and the terminus. To explain these results, it is hypothesized that after cleavage the enzyme cycles between a tracking (and possibly back-tracking) mode which is fueled by ATP hydrolysis and a relatively long static period in which ATP hydrolysis does not occur. While tracking, the enzyme would be bound both to the recognition site and to a distal site but, while static, the enzyme would be bound only at the recognition site of nonlooped molecules. This post-nuclease phase of the reaction is hypothesized to reflect a reaction whereby the enzyme initially scans DNA molecules before making a strand cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W1596498390,"The role of extracellular Ca2+ in the binding of corticotropin (ACTH) to adrenocortical cell receptors as well as in the post-binding events involved in steroidogenesis were investigated. Binding studies using [125I-Tyr23,Phe2,Nle4]ACTH (1-38) peptide showed that extracellular Ca2+ is essential not only for the interaction of ACTH with its receptor, but also for continued occupancy of the receptor. In view of the requirement of Ca2+ for binding the hormone to the receptor, the role of Ca2+ in post-receptor events was investigated by covalently attaching the hormone to its receptor by photoaffinity labeling in the presence of Ca2+. Persistent activation of steroidogenesis induced by photoaffinity labeling in the presence of Ca2+ was depressed when cells were incubated in medium containing EGTA but was unaffected when the cells were merely washed and incubated in Ca2+-free medium. In the presence of EGTA, 8-Br-cAMP partially restored persistent activation of steroidogenesis. The concentration of extracellular Ca2+ required for restoring steroidogenesis was 10-fold lower than the concentration of Ca2+ needed for optimal binding of ACTH to its receptor. These results suggest that the primary role of extracellular Ca2+ in the action of ACTH is to facilitate the association of the hormone with its receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1515841895,"To determine the apolipoprotein specificity of high density lipoprotein (HDL) receptor, apolipoprotein A-I (apo-AI) and apolipoprotein A-II (apo-AII) purified from high density lipoprotein3 (HDL3) were reconstituted into dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine vesicles (DMPC) and their ability to bind to luteinized rat ovarian membranes was examined. Both 125I-apo-A-I.DMPC and 125I-apo-A-II.DMPC were shown to bind to ovarian membranes with Kd = 2.87 and 5.70 micrograms of protein/ml, respectively. The binding of both 125I-apo-A-I.DMPC and 125I-apo-A-II.DMPC was inhibited by unlabeled HDL3, apo-A-I.DMPC, apo-A-II.DMPC, apo-C-I.DMPC, apo-C-II.DMPC, apo-C-III1.DMPC, and apo-C-III2.DMPC, but not by DMPC vesicles, bovine serum albumin.DMPC or low density lipoprotein. Since the binding labeled apo-A-I.DMPC and apo-A-II.DMPC was inhibited by the DMPC complexes of apo-C groups, the direct binding of 125I-apo-C-III1.DMPC was also demonstrated with Kd = 9.6 micrograms of protein/ml. In addition, unlabeled apo-A-I.DMPC, and apo-A-II.DMPC, as well as apo-C.DMPC, inhibited 125I-HDL3 binding. 125I-apo-A-I, 125I-apo-A-II, and 125I-apo-C-III1 in the absence of DMPC also bind to the membranes. These results suggest that HDL receptor recognizes apolipoprotein AI, AII, and the C group and that the binding specificity of the reconstituted lipoproteins is conferred by their apolipoprotein moiety rather than the lipid environment. In vivo pretreatment of rats with human chorionic gonadotropin resulted in an increase of 125I-apo-A-I.DMPC, 125I-apo-A-II.DMPC, and 125I-apo-C-III1.DMPC binding activities. However, no induction of binding activity was observed when the apolipoprotein was not included in DMPC vesicles. An examination of the equilibrium dissociation constant and binding capacity for 125I-apo-A-I.DMPC and 125I-apo-A-II.DMPC after human chorionic gonadotropin treatment revealed that the increase in binding activity was due to an increase in the number of binding sites rather than a change in the binding affinity. These results further support our contention that apo-A-I, apo-A-II, and the apo-C group bind to HDL receptor. In conclusion, the HDL receptor of luteinized rat ovary recognizes apolipoproteins A-I, A-II, and the C group but not low density lipoprotein, and the binding is induced by human chorionic gonadotropin in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1590394405,"Cytochrome c peroxidase and cytochrome c form a noncovalent electron transfer complex in the course of the peroxidase-catalyzed reduction of H2O2. The two hemoproteins were cross-linked in 40% yield to a covalent 1:1 complex with the aid of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide. The covalent complex was found to be a valid model of the noncovalent electron transfer complex for the following reasons. The covalent complex had only 5% residual peroxidase activity toward exogeneous ferrocytochrome c indicating that the cross-linked cytochrome c covers the electron-accepting site of cytochrome c peroxidase. The residual peroxidase activity was almost independent of ionic strength indicating that the electron-accepting site is much less accessible even when ionic bonds between the two cross-linked hemoproteins are severed. The rate of reduction of heme c by ascorbate is 15 times slower in the covalent complex than in free cytochrome c and is independent of ionic strength. Although the covalent complex may not have been entirely pure with respect to the number and location of the cross-links, two major cross-links could be localized to within a few residues. One is from Lys 13 of cytochrome c to an acidic residue in positions 32, 33, 34, 35, or 37 of cytochrome c peroxidase, the other from Lys 86 of cytochrome c to a carboxyl group in the same cluster of acidic residues. The result stresses the importance of a peculiar stretch of acidic residues of cytochrome c peroxidase and of Lys 13 and 86 of cytochrome c."
https://openalex.org/W1513061619,"Cytochrome c peroxidase forms an electron transfer complex with cytochrome c. The complex is governed by ionic bonds between side chain amino groups of cytochrome c and carboxyl groups of peroxidase. To localize the binding site for cytochrome c on the peroxidase, we have used the method of differential chemical modification. By this method the chemical reactivity of carboxyl groups (toward carbodiimide/aminoethane sulfonate) was compared in free and in complexed peroxidase. When ferricytochrome c was bound to cytochrome c peroxidase, acidic residues 33, 34, 35, 37, 221, 224, and 1 to 3 carboxyls at the C terminus became less reactive by a factor of approximately 4, relative to the remaining 39 carboxylates of peroxidase. Of the less reactive residues those in the 30-40 region and the 221/224 pair are on opposite sides of the surface area which contains the heme propionates. We, therefore, propose that the binding site for cytochrome c on cytochrome c peroxidase spans the area where one heme edge comes close to the molecular surface. The results are in very good agreement with chemical cross-linking studies (Waldmeyer, B., and Bosshard, H.R. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 5184-5190); they also support a hypothetical model predicted on the basis of the known crystal structures of cytochrome c and peroxidase (Poulos, T.L., and Kraut, J. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 10322-10330)."
https://openalex.org/W1578649546,"Nitrate reductase from Escherichia coli has been investigated by low-temperature magnetic circular dichroism and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies, as well as by Fe-S core extrusion, to determine the Fe-S cluster composition. The results indicate approximately one 3Fe and three or four [4Fe-4S]2+,1+ centers/molecule of isolated enzyme. The magnetic circular dichroism spectra and magnetization characteristics show the oxidized and reduced 3Fe and [4Fe-4S] centers to be electronically analogous to those in bacterial ferredoxins. The form and spin quantitation of the EPR spectra from [4Fe-4S]1+ centers in the reduced enzyme were found to vary with the conditions of reduction. For the fully reduced enzyme, the EPR spectrum accounted for between 2.9 and 3.5 spins/molecule, and comparison with partially reduced spectra indicates weak intercluster magnetic interactions between reduced paramagnetic centers. In common with other Fe-S proteins, the 3Fe center was not extruded intact under standard conditions. The results suggest that nitrate reductase is the first example of a metalloenzyme where enzymatic activity is associated with a form that contains an oxidized 3Fe center. However, experiments to determine whether or not the 3Fe center is present in vivo were inconclusive."
https://openalex.org/W1561257955,"The membrane insertion of the E1 protein of a coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus A59, was studied in a wheat germ cell-free translation system. E1 is a transmembrane protein spanning the lipid bilayer several times. It is synthesized without a cleavable signal sequence, localized intracellularly, and not transported to the cell surface. It thus represents a model intracellular protein. We found that the synthesis of E1 is specifically and stably blocked by the addition of signal recognition particle to the wheat germ system. Subsequent addition of salt-extracted pancreatic microsomes resulted in the full release of this arrest as well as the completion and the correct membrane integration of E1. Such signal recognition particle-induced arrests failed to produce shorter peptides of a defined length. Addition of signal recognition particle to a synchronized translation at any time during the synthesis of about the first two thirds of E1 (150 amino acids) blocked further translation, suggesting that the most C-terminal of the three internal hydrophobic domains of E1 could function as its signal sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1495595397,"Abstract The reagent 1-ethyl-3-(3-[14C]trimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (ETC) was used to identify specific carboxyl groups on the cytochrome bc1 complex (ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase, EC 1.10.2.2) involved in binding cytochrome c. Treatment of the cytochrome bc1 complex with 2 mM ETC led to inhibition of the electron transfer activity with cytochrome c. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that both the cytochrome c1 heme peptide and the Mr = 9175 peptide were radiolabeled by ETC. In addition, a new band appeared at a position consistent with a 1:1 cross-linked cytochrome c1-hinge peptide species. Treatment of a 1:1 cytochrome bc1-cytochrome c complex with ETC led to the same inhibition of electron transfer activity observed with the uncomplexed cytochrome bc1, but to decreased radiolabeling of the cytochrome c1 heme peptide. Two new cross-linked species corresponding to cytochrome c-hinge peptide and cytochrome c-cytochrome c1 were formed in place of the cytochrome c1-hinge peptide species. In order to identify the specific carboxyl groups labeled by ETC, a purified cytochrome c1 preparation containing both the heme peptide and the hinge peptide was dimethylated at all the lysines to prevent internal cross-linking. The methylated cytochrome c1 preparation was treated with ETC and digested with trypsin and chymotrypsin, and the resulting peptides were separated by high pressure liquid chromatography. ETC was found to label the cytochrome c1 peptides 63-81, 121-128, and 153-179 and the hinge peptides 1-17 and 48-65. All of these peptides are highly acidic and contain one or more regions of adjacent carboxyl groups. The only peptide consistently protected from labeling by cytochrome c binding was 63-81, demonstrating that the carboxyl groups at residues 66, 67, 76, and 77 are involved in binding cytochrome c. These residues are relatively close to the heme-binding cysteine residues 37 and 40 and indicate a possible site for electron transfer from cytochrome c1 to cytochrome c."
https://openalex.org/W1559757000,"Abstract The production and spectroscopic properties of an L-selenomethionine-containing homolog of Pseudomonas aeruginosa azurin are described. The amino acid substitution was carried out by developing an L-methionine-dependent bacterial strain from a fully functional ATCC culture. Uptake studies monitored using L-[75Se]methionine indicated that L-selenomethionine was incorporated into the protein synthetic pathway of Pseudomonas bacteria in a manner analogous to L-methionine. Several batches of bacteria were grown, and one sample of isolated and purified selenoazurin (azurin in which methionine was substituted by selenomethionine) was found (by neutron activation analysis) to contain 5.2 +/- 0.8 seleniums/copper. Correspondingly, a residual 0.35 methionines, relative to 6.0 in the native protein, were found by amino acid analysis in this azurin sample. The redox potential and extinction coefficient of this selenoazurin were found to be 333 +/- 1 mV (pH 7.0, I = 0.22) and 5855 +/- 160 M-1 cm-1 at 626 +/- 1 nm, respectively. Visible electronic, CD, and EPR spectra are reported and Gaussian curve fitting to the former spectrum allowed assignment of the selenomethionine Se----Cu(II) transition to a band found at 18034 cm-1, based upon an observed 450 cm-1 shift to the red from the analogous band position in the native protein. The data are consistent with a relatively more covalent copper site stabilizing the reduced, Cu(I), form in the selenoprotein. A role for the methionine as a modulator of the blue copper site redox potential by metal----ligand back bonding from Cu(I) is discussed in terms of a ligand sphere which limits the valence change at copper to much less than 1 during a redox cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1635915907,"Human cDNA libraries were screened with a cDNA fragment presumably encoding the 3' terminus of a procollagen carboxyl propeptide not identifiable as types I, II, III, or IV by protein sequence or Northern blot hybridization. One clone contained a 1350-base pair insert coding in part for 55 uninterrupted Gly-X-Y triplets. Comparison with the amino acid composition of the COOH-terminal cyanogen bromide (CB) peptides of the alpha 1 and alpha 2 type V collagen chains showed similarity only to the alpha 2(V)CB fragment. To identify the NH2 terminus of the peptide designated by methionine, an additional isolate was sequenced and found to contain a Gly-Met-Pro triplet. Thirty-one amino acids from the NH2 terminus of the alpha 2(V)CB9 fragment were then determined by Edman degradation and found to be identical to those derived from the cDNA clone. The DNA sequence encoding part of the triple helical region establishes for the first time the partial structure of a type V collagen chain. Although comparison of residues 796-1020 of the alpha 2(V) collagenous region with alpha 1 (III), alpha 1(I), and alpha 2(I) shows strong conservation of charged positions, the latter three chains appear considerably more similar to each other than to alpha 2(V). A striking feature of the alpha 2(V) sequence between 918-944 is the absence of proline residues. In the analogous region of alpha 1(I) where this amino acid is also lacking, a flexible site in the rigid triple helical structure of type I collagen has been observed (Hofmann, H., Voss, T., Kuhn, K. and Engel, J. (1984) J. Mol. Biol. 172, 325-343)."
https://openalex.org/W1599420738,"Purified canine cardiac sarcolemmal membrane vesicles exhibit a sodium ion for proton exchange activity (Na+/H+ exchange). Na+/H+ exchange was demonstrated both by measuring rapid 22Na uptake into sarcolemmal vesicles in response to a transmembrane H+ gradient and by following H+ transport in response to a transmembrane Na+ gradient with use of the probe acridine orange. Maximal 22Na uptake into the sarcolemmal vesicles (with starting intravesicular pH = 6 and extravesicular pH = 8) was approximately 20 nmol/mg protein. The extravesicular Km of the Na+/H+ exchange activity for Na+ was determined to be between 2 and 4 mM (intravesicular pH = 5.9, extravesicular pH = 7.9), as assessed by measuring the concentration dependence of the 22Na uptake rate and the ability of extravesicular Na+ to collapse an imposed H+ gradient. All results suggested that Na+/H+ exchange was reversible and tightly coupled. The Na+/H+ exchange activity was assayed in membrane subfractions and found most concentrated in highly purified cardiac sarcolemmal vesicles and was absent from free and junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles. 22Na uptake into sarcolemmal vesicles mediated by Na+/H+ exchange was dependent on extravesicular pH, having an optimum around pH 9 (initial internal pH = 6). Although the Na+/H+ exchange activity was not inhibited by tetrodotoxin or digitoxin, it was inhibited by quinidine, quinacrine, amiloride, and several amiloride derivatives. The relative potencies of the various inhibitors tested were found to be: quinacrine greater than quinidine = ethylisopropylamiloride greater than methylisopropylamiloride greater than dimethylamiloride greater than amiloride. The Na+/H+ exchange activity identified in purified cardiac sarcolemmal vesicles appears to be qualitatively similar to Na+/H+ exchange activities recently described in intact cell systems. Isolated cardiac sarcolemmal vesicles should prove a useful model system for the study of Na+/H+ exchange regulation in myocardial tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1577407665,"The outer nuclear membrane is morphologically similar to rough endoplasmic reticulum. The presence of ribosomes bound to its cytoplasmic surface suggests that it could be a site of synthesis of membrane glycoproteins. We have examined the biogenesis of the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein in the nuclear envelope as a model for the biogenesis of membrane glycoproteins. G protein was present in nuclear membranes of infected Friend erythroleukemia cells immediately following synthesis and was transported out of nuclear membranes to cytoplasmic membranes with a time course similar to transport from rough endoplasmic reticulum (t 1/2 = 5-7 min). Temperature-sensitive mutations in viral membrane proteins which block transport of G protein from endoplasmic reticulum also blocked transport of G protein from the nuclear envelope. Friend erythroleukemia cells and NIH 3T3 cells differed in the fraction of newly synthesized G protein found in nuclear membranes, apparently reflecting the relative amount of nuclear membrane compared to endoplasmic reticulum available for glycoprotein synthesis. Nuclear membranes from erythroleukemia cells appeared to have the enzymatic activities necessary for cleavage of the signal sequence and core glycosylation of newly synthesized G protein. Signal peptidase activity was detected by the ability of detergent-solubilized membranes of isolated nuclei to correctly remove the signal sequence of human preplacental lactogen. RNA isolated from the nuclear envelope was highly enriched for G protein mRNA, suggesting that G protein was synthesized on the outer nuclear membrane rather than redistributing to nuclear membranes from endoplasmic reticulum before or during cell fractionation. These results suggest a mechanism for incorporation of membrane glycoproteins into the nuclear envelope and suggest that in some cell types the nuclear envelope is a major source of newly synthesized membrane glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1555238708,"We have used oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis to generate a mutant human initiator tRNA gene in which the sequence GATCG corresponding to the universal GAUCG found in loop IV of eukaryotic cytoplasmic initiator tRNAs is changed to GTTCG. The mutant tRNA gene has been characterized by restriction mapping and by DNA sequencing. We show that this mutation has no effect on in vitro transcription of the tRNA gene in HeLa cell extracts. Transcripts derived from both the wild type (A54) and the mutant (T54) initiator tRNA genes are processed in vitro to produce mature tRNAs with the correct 5'-and 3'-termini. Fingerprint analysis of in vitro transcripts shows that the mutant RNA has the expected nucleotide change. Modified nucleotide composition analyses on the RNAs show that when A54 is changed to U54, the neighboring nucleotide U55 is modified quantitatively to psi 55 in the in vitro extracts; U54 itself is partially modified to ribo-T. Other modified bases identified in the in vitro transcripts include m1G, m2G, m7G, D, and m5C."

The sequence data have revealed an open reading frame, designated gene X, which encodes a polypeptide with 312 amino acid residues. Both in vivo and in vitro expressions of the x gene result in the synthesis of a soluble protein with an apparent Mr of 35,000. The x gene is transcribed in the same direction as that of the ileS-lsp operon and opposite to that of the upstream adjacent rpsT gene. No transcription termination sequence can be discerned in the intercistronic region between the x and ileS genes.

https://openalex.org/W1607386448,"Succinate dehydrogenase is a conserved membrane-bound enzyme consisting of two nonidentical subunits: a flavo iron-sulfur protein (Fp) subunit, containing a covalently bound flavin, and an iron-sulfur protein (Ip) subunit. Bacillus subtilis succinate dehydrogenase in wild type bacteria and 12 well characterized succinate dehydrogenase-defective mutants were examined by low temperature EPR spectroscopy to characterize the enzyme and study subunit location and biosynthesis of its iron-sulfur clusters. The wild type B. subtilis enzyme contains iron-sulfur clusters which are analogous to clusters S-1 and S-3 of bovine heart succinate dehydrogenase but with slightly different EPR characteristics. Spins from cluster S-2 were not detectable as in the case of the intact form of bovine heart succinate dehydrogenase. However, dithionite reduction of the B. subtilis enzyme greatly enhanced spin relaxation of the ferredoxin-type cluster S-1, indicating the presence of the cluster S-2. Iron-sulfur cluster S-1 was found to be assembled in soluble succinate dehydrogenase subunits in the cytoplasm, but only if full-length Fp polypeptides and relatively large fragments of Ip polypeptides were present. Cluster S-1 was not detected in mutants with soluble mutated Fp polypeptides or in a mutant totally lacking Ip subunit polypeptide. Iron-sulfur clusters S-1, S-2, and S-3 were assembled also when the covalently bound flavin in the Fp subunit was absent. Clusters S-1 and S-3 in the membrane-bound flavin-deficient succinate dehydrogenase were not reduced by succinate but could be reduced by electron transfer from NADH dehydrogenase via the menaquinone pool."
https://openalex.org/W2138801968,"13C NMR spectroscopy has been used to characterize Amadori (ketoamine) adducts formed by reaction of [2-13C]glucose with free amino groups of protein. The spectra of glycated proteins were acquired in phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 and were interpreted by reference to the spectra of model compounds, N alpha-formyl-N epsilon-fructose-lysine and glycated poly-L-lysine (GlcPLL). The anomeric carbon region of the spectrum (approximately 90-105 ppm) of glycated cytochrome c was superimposable on that of N alpha-formyl-N epsilon-fructose-lysine, and contained three peaks characteristic of the alpha- and beta-furanose and beta-pyranose anomers of Amadori adducts to peripheral lysine residues on protein (pK alpha approximately 10.5). The spectrum of GlcPLL yielded six anomeric carbon resonances; the second set of three was displaced about 2 ppm to lower shielding of the first and was assigned to the Amadori adduct at the alpha-amino terminus (pK alpha approximately 7.5). The spectrum of glycated RNase was similar to that of GlcPLL, but contained a third set of three signals attributable to modification of active site lysine 41 (pK alpha approximately 8.8). The assignments for RNase were confirmed by analysis of spectra taken at pH 4 and under denaturing conditions. The spectrum of glycated hemoglobin was comparable to that of GlcPLL, and distinct resonances could be assigned to Amadori adducts at amino-terminal valine and intrachain N epsilon-lysine residues. Chemical analyses were performed to measure the relative extent of alpha- and epsilon-amino group modification in the glycated macromolecules, and the results were compared with estimates based on integration of the NMR spectra."
https://openalex.org/W1506922677,"A procedure for the isolation of mutants affected in components containing glycerol derived from phospholipids yielded two mutant strains that contain membrane-derived oligosaccharides (MDO) devoid of glycerol (Rotering, H., Fiedler, W., Rollinger, W., and Braun, V.

The biosynthesis of MDO is osmoregulated (Kennedy, E. P. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 79, 1092-1095) and linked to the metabolism of phospholipids (van Golde, L. M. G., Schulman, H., and Kennedy, E. P. (1973) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 70, 1368-1372). This leads to substitution of MDO with sn-1-phosphoglycerol and phosphoethanolamine (Kennedy, E. P., Rumley, M. K., Schulman, P., and van Golde, L. M. G. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 4208-4213). MDO also contain succinate in O-ester linkage. We now report that one mutant strain lacks phosphoglycerol transferase I activity and thus is unable to transfer sn-1-phosphoglycerol residues from phosphatidylglycerol to MDO. The mdoB gene affected in this mutant has been located at 99.2 min on the E. coli chromosome. The ethanolamine content of MDO isolated from the mutant strain is elevated, whereas the number of succinate residues is not affected. The only phenotype of mdoB mutants we found is a dramatic reduction of the diglyceride content observed in dgk mdoB double mutants when the beta-glucoside arbutin is present in the growth medium."

These vectors were subsequently used to transfect monkey kidney CV-1 cells to obtain recombinant virus stocks carrying each of the initiator tRNA genes. Following infection of CV-1 cells by the recombinant virus stocks, both the wild type and mutant tRNAs are produced in large quantities during a 48-h period. Fingerprint analysis of 32P-labeled tRNAs was used to characterize the tRNAs made in vivo and to show that the sequence AUCG in loop IV of the wild type tRNA is replaced by T psi CG in the mutant tRNA. Modified nucleotide composition analysis of the [32P]tRNAs overproduced in vivo shows that they contain all the modified nucleotides found in human placenta initiator tRNA. Both wild type and mutant initiator tRNAs can be aminoacylated by either mammalian or Escherichia coli methionyl-tRNA synthetases. Furthermore, the mutant tRNA can be easily separated from the endogenous monkey initiator tRNA by RPC-5 column chromatography."
https://openalex.org/W1515925032,"Adenylate cyclase in cultured human fibroblasts is activated by prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) or beta-adrenergic agonists, e.g., isoproterenol, and inhibited by muscarinic agonists. Incubation with PGE1 reduced adenylate cyclase responsiveness to both PGE1 and isoproterenol; this so-called heterologous desensitization is believed to result from impaired function of the stimulatory guanyl nucleotide-binding protein of the cyclase complex. The effect of heterologous desensitization by PGE1 on inhibition of adenylate cyclase by the muscarinic agonist oxotremorine was examined. Muscarinic inhibition of basal and isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulation was attenuated following exposure to PGE1; the concentration of oxotremorine required for half-maximal inhibition of cAMP accumulation was increased. In both intact cells and membrane preparations the number of binding sites for [3H]scopolamine, a muscarinic antagonist, was unaltered by desensitization. Following exposure to PGE1, receptor affinity for oxotremorine, assessed by competition with [3H] scopolamine, and the guanyl nucleotide sensitivity of agonist binding were reduced. The amount of inhibitory guanyl nucleotide-binding regulatory protein available for [32P]ADP-ribosylation by pertussis toxin was unaltered by desensitization. Thus, heterologous desensitization of adenylate cyclase with the stimulatory agonist PGE1 alters sensitivity to inhibitory as well as stimulatory ligands."

Essentially quantitative cross-linking of cytochrome c and flavodoxin was observed at low ionic strengths with the carbodiimide cross-linking reagent. An association constant of 4 X 10^4 M^(-1) was obtained between cytochrome c and flavodoxin at 88 mM ionic strength from analysis of the cross-linking studies. This value is similar to the association constant determined kinetically during the electron transfer reaction between cytochrome c and flavodoxin (Simondsen, R.P., Weber, P.C., Salemme, F.R., and Tollin, G.

The kinetic analysis showed negative cooperativity with one high affinity (Km1 = 3 microM) and one low affinity (Km2 = 208 microM) site for ATP. The rate of hydrolysis decreased at 2000 microM ATP indicating a third site for ATP. When the pH was decreased to 6.5 the experimental results followed Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics with one low affinity site (Km = 116 microM). Higher concentrations than 750 microM ATP were inhibitory. Proton transport was measured as accumulation of acridine orange in vesicles equilibrated with 150 mM KCl. The transport at various concentrations of ATP in the pH interval from 6.0 to 8.0 correlated well with the Hill equation with a Hill coefficient between 1.5-1.9. The concentration of ATP resulting in half-maximal transport rate (S0.5) increased from 5 microM at pH 6.0 to 420 microM at pH 8.0. At acidic pH the rate of proton transport decreased at 1000 microM ATP. The K+-stimulated p-nitrophenylphosphatase (pNPPase) activity resulted in a Hill coefficient close to 2 indicating cooperative binding of substrate. The pNPPase was noncompetitively inhibited by ATP and ADP; half-maximal inhibition was obtained at 2 and 100 microM, respectively. Phospholipase C-treated vesicles lost 80% of the pNPPase activity, but the Hill coefficient did not change. These kinetic results are used for a further development of the reaction scheme of the H,K-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1625208520,"The binding of 125I-calmodulin to intact secretion granules and protein gel blots of secretion granules from pancreatic islet tissue was examined. Binding of 125I-calmodulin to intact secretion granules was Ca2+-dependent and inhibited by the calmodulin inhibitors trifluoperazine and calmidazolium. Binding was inhibited by excess (200 nM) unlabeled calmodulin, but not by parvalbumin, a Ca2+-binding protein which has little sequence homology to calmodulin. In order to study the binding of calmodulin to specific secretion granule proteins, secretion granules were solubilized, and the solubilized proteins were resolved on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose, and incubated with 125I-calmodulin. Autoradiograms of the protein gel blots revealed the presence of three major calmodulin-binding proteins with approximate molecular weights of 73,000, 64,000, and 58,000. These proteins reversibly bound calmodulin in a calcium-dependent manner. Unlabeled calmodulin in the range of 0.1-1.0 nM competed with 125I-calmodulin for binding to these proteins, whereas troponin and parvalbumin were 100 and 1000-fold less effective, respectively. Trifluoperazine blocked binding to the granule proteins in a range of 10(-4) to 10(-5) M, and calmidazolium was effective between 10(-5) and 10(-6) M. Trypsin, at a concentration which did not lyse granules, markedly inhibited calmodulin binding to intact secretion granules. Protein blots from trypsin-treated granules showed that the three major calmodulin-binding proteins were absent. These results indicate that Ca2+-dependent calmodulin-binding proteins are present on the cytoplasmic surface of islet secretion granules and are consistent with the hypothesis that these proteins may play a role in secretion granule exocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1509510250,"The mechanism of pantothenate transport across the plasma membrane was investigated with initial velocity studies of [14C]pantothenate uptake and efflux in rat liver parenchymal cells maintained in primary culture. At 116 mM sodium, double-reciprocal plots of the initial velocity of uptake versus [pantothenate] were linear from 0.3 to 36.5 microM pantothenate and gave an apparent Km,pant of 11 +/- 2 microM. The rate of pantothenate uptake at 0 [sodium] was about 14% of the rate at 116 mM sodium, and the reciprocal of the apparent Km,pant was a linear function of [sodium]. Vmax obtained by extrapolation to infinite [pantothenate] was independent of [sodium]. Ouabain, gramicidin D, cyanide, azide, and 2,4-dinitrophenol inhibited uptake, but preloading cells with pantothenate did not. Pantothenate derivatives or carboxylic acids were only weak inhibitors of uptake. Efflux was measured in cells preloaded with [14C]pantothenate. The apparent Km for efflux was 85 +/- 29 microM, and the rate of efflux was unaffected by addition of pantothenate, sodium, ouabain, gramicidin D, or 2,4-dinitrophenol to the external medium. These features are consistent with a mechanism for pantothenate transport in which sodium and pantothenate are cotransported in a 1:1 ratio on a carrier highly specific for pantothenate; sodium decreases the apparent Km for pantothenate, and a sodium-carrier complex forms only on the intracellular side of the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1510182625,"Tetrahydrobiopterin, the cofactor for the aromatic amino acid hydroxylases, is synthesized in mammals from GTP via a pathway involving both dihydropterin and tetrahydropterin intermediates. In this work, we have investigated the mechanism of conversion of the product formed from GTP, 7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate, into the tetrahydropterin intermediates. Tetrahydrobiopterin can be oxidized under conditions which yield pterin or pterin 6-carboxylate without exchange of the C-6 and C-7 protons. Using these techniques, a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry method was developed to determine that in the biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin de novo, in preparations of bovine adrenal medulla, the C-6 proton of tetrahydrobiopterin is derived from water and not from NADPH. In contrast, the C-6 proton of tetrahydrobiopterin produced from sepiapterin (6-lactoyl-7,8-dihydropterin) comes from NADPH. The results are consistent with evidence for the formation of the first tetrahydropterin intermediate by a tautomerization without any requirement for NADPH."
https://openalex.org/W1580010175,"Norepinephrine and epinephrine, in the presence of the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (10(-5) M), stimulated adipocyte pyruvate dehydrogenase at low concentrations but inhibited the enzyme at higher concentrations. The alpha-adrenergic agonist, phenylephrine, rapidly stimulated pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in a dose-dependent manner with maximal stimulation observed at 10(-6) M. The stimulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase by phenylephrine was mediated via alpha 1-receptors. Inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase by catecholamines was mediated via beta-adrenergic receptors, since the beta-agonist, isoproterenol, and dibutyryl cAMP produced similar effects. Like insulin, alpha-adrenergic agonists increased the active form of pyruvate dehydrogenase without changing the total enzyme activity and cellular ATP concentration. The effects induced by maximally effective concentrations of insulin and alpha-adrenergic agonists were nonadditive. The ability of phenylephrine and methoxamine to stimulate pyruvate dehydrogenase and phosphorylase and to inhibit glycogen synthase was not affected by the removal of extracellular Ca2+. Similarly, the stimulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase and glycogen synthase by insulin was also observed under the same conditions. However, when intracellular adipocyte Ca2+ was depleted by incubating cells in a Ca2+-free buffer containing 1 mM ethylene glycol bis(beta-amino-ethyl ether)-N,N,N' -tetraacetic acid, the actions of alpha-adrenergic agonists, but not insulin, on pyruvate dehydrogenase were completely abolished. Vasopressin and angiotensin II also stimulated pyruvate dehydrogenase in a dose-dependent manner with enhancement of glucose oxidation and lipogenesis. Our results demonstrate that the Ca2+ -dependent hormones stimulate pyruvate dehydrogenase and lipogenesis in isolated rat adipocytes, and the action is dependent upon intracellular, but not extracellular, Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1577449992,"The role of essential fatty acids in membrane functions related to receptor-mediated endocytosis of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was investigated using a human laryngeal carcinoma cell line (HEp-2) grown in chemically defined serum-free medium (DM) to deplete their essential fatty acid contents. VSV replicated much less effectively in HEp-2 cells grown in DM as compared to serum containing complete medium (CM). Observed reduction in the rate of virus multiplication was, at least in part, due to reduced virus penetration which was monitored using VSV labeled with nitroxyl free radicals as electron spin probe. Surface proteins of VSV were labeled with maleimide spin-label, and succinimide spin-label. Ni2+ was used as a broadening agent to identify the spin-label signals from viruses inside the cell. HEp-2 cells and mouse leukemia cell line L1210 treated with 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl (dansyl) cadaverine, an agent previously shown to inhibit the uptake of VSV in vitro, was used as a positive control in some experiments. VSV penetrated less effectively in both DM-grown cells and in CM-grown cells in the presence of dansylcadaverine. Similar results were obtained by monitoring the uptake of 125I-labeled VSV. When HEp-2 cells grown for several generations in DM were incubated with 10% fetal calf serum for 16 h, the cells supported virus replication to a similar extent as the cells grown in CM. In contrast, addition of arachidonic acid restored VSV growth only partially. Continued growth of HEp-2 cells in DM resulted in a shift in fatty acyl chain composition of phospholipids. The results indicate a finite role for essential fatty acids in receptor-mediated internalization of virus particles."
