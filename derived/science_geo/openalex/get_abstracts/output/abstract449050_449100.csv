https://openalex.org/W2129684561,"Although we have convincing evidence that attention to auditory stimuli modulates neuronal responses at or before the level of primary auditory cortex (A1), the underlying physiological mechanisms are unknown. We found that attending to rhythmic auditory streams resulted in the entrainment of ongoing oscillatory activity reflecting rhythmic excitability fluctuations in A1. Strikingly, although the rhythm of the entrained oscillations in A1 neuronal ensembles reflected the temporal structure of the attended stream, the phase depended on the attended frequency content. Counter-phase entrainment across differently tuned A1 regions resulted in both the amplification and sharpening of responses at attended time points, in essence acting as a spectrotemporal filter mechanism. Our data suggest that selective attention generates a dynamically evolving model of attended auditory stimulus streams in the form of modulatory subthreshold oscillations across tonotopically organized neuronal ensembles in A1 that enhances the representation of attended stimuli."

Persistent firing arises from recurrent excitation within a network of pyramidal Delay cells. Here, we examined glutamate receptor influences underlying persistent firing in primate dlPFC during a spatial working memory task. Computational models predicted dependence on NMDA receptor (NMDAR) NR2B stimulation, and Delay cell persistent firing was abolished by local NR2B NMDAR blockade or by systemic ketamine administration. AMPA receptors (AMPARs) contributed background depolarization to sustain network firing. In contrast, many Response cells were sensitive to AMPAR blockade and increased firing after systemic ketamine, indicating that models of ketamine actions should be refined to reflect neuronal heterogeneity. The reliance of Delay cells on NMDAR may explain why insults to NMDARs in schizophrenia or Alzheimer’s disease profoundly impair cognition.

Primate prefrontal cortical working memory circuits require NMDA NR2B receptors Blocking NMDA, but not AMPA receptors, markedly reduced Delay cell firing Systemic ketamine also reduced Delay cell firing but increased Response cell firing These primate data should redefine NMDA glutamate theories of cognitive disorders Neurons in the highly evolved primate dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) have properties of mental representation, i.e., the ability to embody information in the absence of sensory stimulation (Arnsten et al., 2012Arnsten A.F.T.

This capability is the foundation of abstract thought and a basic building block for more complex dlPFC cognitive operations. The higher cognitive functions of the dlPFC are devastated in disorders such as schizophrenia (Barch and Ceaser, 2012Barch D.M. Ceaser A. Cognition in schizophrenia: core psychological and neural mechanisms.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2012; 16: 27-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD; Schroeter et al., 2012Schroeter M.L. Vogt B. Frisch S. Becker G. Barthel H. Mueller K. Villringer A. Sabri O. Executive deficits are related to the inferior frontal junction in early dementia.Brain. 2012; 135: 201-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The neural basis of representational knowledge has been studied most extensively using visuospatial working memory paradigms in monkeys, in which dlPFC neurons generate persistent firing to maintain a remembered location over a brief delay period, so-called Delay cells. Delay cell persistent neuronal firing arises from recurrent excitation within pyramidal cell microcircuits in deep layer III of primate dlPFC, maintaining neural excitation in the absence of “bottom-up” sensory inputs (Goldman-Rakic, 1995Goldman-Rakic P.S. Cellular basis of working memory.Neuron. 1995; 14: 477-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1860) Google Scholar). Layer III dlPFC pyramidal cells excite each other through glutamatergic synapses on long, thin spines (Dumitriu et al., 2010Dumitriu D. Hao J. Hara Y. Kaufmann J. Janssen W.G. Lou W. Rapp P.R.

Constellation of HCN Channels and cAMP regulating proteins in dendritic spines of the primate prefrontal cortex: potential substrate for working memory deficits in schizophrenia.Cereb. Cortex. 2012; 2012: 12Google Scholar). The spatial specificity of neuronal firing is refined by lateral inhibition from GABAergic interneurons, sculpting more precise representations of visual space (Goldman-Rakic, 1995Goldman-Rakic P.S. Cellular basis of working memory.Neuron. 1995; 14: 477-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1860) Google Scholar). The numbers of layer III spines and synapses increase greatly in primate evolution and are thought to underlie the expansion of human cognition (Elston, 2003Elston G.N. Cortex, cognition and the cell: new insights into the pyramidal neuron and prefrontal function.Cereb. Cortex. 2003; 13: 1124-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). However, these circuits are also heavily afflicted in schizophrenia (Glantz and Lewis, 2000Glantz L.A. Lewis D.A. Decreased dendritic spine density on prefrontal cortical pyramidal neurons in schizophrenia.Arch. Gen. Psychiatry. 2000; 57: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar) and in AD (Bussière et al., 2003Bussière T. Giannakopoulos P. Bouras C. Perl D.P. Morrison J.H. Hof P.R.

Comp. Neurol. 2003; 463: 281-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The dlPFC Delay cells appear to convey represented information to Response cells, which in turn project to the motor systems (Arnsten et al., 2012Arnsten A.F.T. Wang M.J. Paspalas C.D. Neuromodulation of thought: flexibilities and vulnerabilities in prefrontal cortical network synapses.Neuron. 2012; 76: 223-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Response cells are probably localized in layer V (Sawaguchi et al., 1989Sawaguchi T. Matsumura M. Kubota K. Depth distribution of neuronal activity related to a visual reaction time task in the monkey prefrontal cortex.J. Neurophysiol. 1989; 61: 435-446PubMed Google Scholar) and fire in anticipation of and/or during the motor response (perisaccadic Response cells), or during and/or after the motor response (postsaccadic Response cells), possibly reflecting feedback from sensory-motor systems regarding the response (Funahashi et al., 1991Funahashi S. Bruce C.J. Goldman-Rakic P.S. Neuronal activity related to saccadic eye movements in the monkey’s dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.J. Neurophysiol. 1991; 65: 1464-1483PubMed Google Scholar). Response-like cells appear to predominate in the rodent PFC (Caetano et al., 2012Caetano M.S. Horst N.K. Harenberg L. Liu B. Arnsten A.F.T. Laubach M. Lost in transition: aging-related changes in executive control by the medial prefrontal cortex.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 3765-3777Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and it is likely that the higher representational operations performed by Delay cells can only be studied in primate dlPFC (Preuss, 1995Preuss T.M. Do rats have prefrontal cortex? The Rose-Woolsey-Akert program reconsidered.J. Cogn. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). The working memory operations of the PFC are fundamentally different from classic synaptic neuroplasticity, involving the transient excitation of a specific subset of cortical circuits rather than enduring changes in synaptic strength. Although there have been extensive studies of the glutamate receptor mechanisms underlying classic neuroplasticity, the receptors mediating the recurrent excitatory circuits underlying working memory in the primate dlPFC are unknown. NMDA receptors (NMDARs) have been of particular interest, and alterations in NMDAR in cognitive disorders such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s disease have focused research on these receptors (Kristiansen et al., 2010bKristiansen L.V.

In many non-PFC brain regions, NMDAR with NR2B subunits are enriched in the synapse during development but move to extrasynaptic locations in the adult, while NMDAR with NR2A subunits predominate in adult synapses (Dumas, 2005Dumas T.C. Developmental regulation of cognitive abilities: modified composition of a molecular switch turns on associative learning.Prog. Neurobiol. 2005; 76: 189-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The open state of NMDAR is regulated by nearby AMPA receptors (AMPARs), which depolarize the membrane and permit NMDAR actions. Adult PFC working memory circuits are regulated differently from sensory cortex and subcortical structures. Computational theories have predicted that the persistent firing of dlPFC working memory networks requires stimulation of NMDAR rather than AMPAR (Compte et al., 2000Compte A. Brunel N.

Synaptic reverberation underlying mnemonic persistent activity.Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 455-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar) and may subserve decision computations as well as working memory (Wang, 2002Wang X.J. Probabilistic decision making by slow reverberation in cortical circuits.Neuron. 2002; 36: 955-968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). In contrast, the faster kinetics of AMPARs lead to dynamical instability and network collapse (Wang, 1999Wang X.J. Synaptic basis of cortical persistent activity: the importance of NMDA receptors to working memory.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9587-9603PubMed Google Scholar). Although rodents do not have dlPFC, studies of rodent medial PFC suggest that NMDARs are important for neuronal burst firing and cognitive functions (Dalton et al., 2011Dalton G.L. Ma L.M.

Groth K. Moghaddam B. Glutamate receptors in the rat medial prefrontal cortex regulate set-shifting ability.Behav. Neurosci. 2003; 117: 728-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and in vitro slice recordings have found evidence of extensive NMDA NR2B signaling in adult rat PFC compared to primary visual cortex (Wang et al., 2008Wang H. Stradtman 3rd, G.G. Wang X.J. Gao W.J. A specialized NMDA receptor function in layer 5 recurrent microcircuitry of the adult rat prefrontal cortex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 16791-16796Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), consistent with computational predictions. Here, we examined the role of NMDAR and AMPAR in the working memory circuits of the primate dlPFC. Immunoelectron microscopy (immuno-EM) showed that NMDA NR2B subunits are found exclusively within the postsynaptic densities of layer III dlPFC spinous synapses in the adult monkey. As recurrent network firing is the “weakest link” in cognitive operations, computational modeling was used to test the hypothesis that reduced NMDAR signaling in even a small subset of network synapses could induce network collapse. Finally, we examined the effects of blocking NMDAR versus AMPAR on dlPFC neuronal firing in monkeys performing a spatial working memory task. Antagonists were applied directly onto the neurons using iontophoresis and included agents that selectively blocked NMDAR with NR2A versus NR2B subunits. Neuronal firing was also examined after systemic administration of the noncompetitive NMDA antagonist ketamine, as this method is increasingly used to model schizophrenia. The results reveal that NMDA NR2B receptor actions are critical to working memory Delay cell persistent firing, in contrast to their relatively minor role in adult neuroplasticity in non-PFC circuits. The data also revealed a subset of Response cells that are sensitive to AMPAR blockade and excited by ketamine administration, similar to rodent PFC neurons after systemic administration of NMDAR antagonists (Jackson et al., 2004Jackson M.E. Homayoun H. Moghaddam B. NMDA receptor hypofunction produces concomitant firing rate potentiation and burst activity reduction in the prefrontal cortex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 8467-8472Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). In contrast, Delay cell firing in monkeys was reduced by systemic ketamine, reinforcing the finding that the more evolved circuits in the primate dlPFC require NMDAR actions and that strategies for cognitive remediation in patients should aim at strengthening, rather than weakening, NMDAR function. Postembedding immunoelectron microscopy was used to localize NR2B subunits in layer III of the adult primate dlPFC. Separate antibodies were used to specifically target phosphorylated NR2B (Figure 2A) or NR2B in either a phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated state (Figures 2B–2D). Both antibodies showed that NMDAR with NR2B subunits are localized exclusively within the postsynaptic density, with no evidence of extrasynaptic labeling (Figures 2A–2D). Thus, NR2B are synaptic receptors in layer III of the adult primate dlPFC. Previous computations have shown that the slow kinetics of NMDAR with NR2B subunits are optimal for synaptic maintenance of dlPFC neuronal persistent firing (Wang, 1999Wang X.J. Synaptic basis of cortical persistent activity: the importance of NMDA receptors to working memory.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9587-9603PubMed Google Scholar, Wang, 2002Wang X.J. Probabilistic decision making by slow reverberation in cortical circuits.Neuron. 2002; 36: 955-968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). The current experiment examined the effects of blocking a small subset of NMDAR synapses within a larger, recurrent excitatory network, as likely occurs with the iontophoresis technique. During iontophoresis, a minute amount of drug alters the firing of only a small number of neurons; the vast majority of dlPFC neurons are unaffected and thus behavioral performance remains intact. The current experiment motivated new model simulations of this experiment, as well as offered a new test of this computational model. The model has 1,600 pyramidal cells and 400 interneurons; the pyramidal cells constitute a number of stimulus-selective populations; each of these populations has 240 spiking neurons. All neurons connect with each other through recurrent excitation, but the connection strength is stronger among neurons within a selective population. In model simulations, one particular neural population received a transient input (its preferred stimulus), triggering persistent activity that is self-sustained by virtue of NMDAR-dependent recurrent excitation within that neural population. In different simulation trials, we reduced the NMDA conductance in a subset of ten neurons out of the 240 neurons in the activated neural population. Figure 2E demonstrates the effects of reducing NMDAR actions from 100% (control conditions) to 90%, 80%, or 70% conductance in these ten affected neurons. Reducing NMDAR actions on ten neurons produced a “dose”-related reduction in task-related firing for all task epochs, with an almost complete loss of firing when NMDAR actions were reduced by only 30%, i.e., to 70% of control levels. On the other hand, the average firing rate of the 240 neuron population containing the ten neurons was only reduced from 42 Hz (control) to 34 Hz when there was a 30% NMDAR reduction in the ten cells (see Figure S1 available online). Therefore, the persistent activity of the overall population of neurons in the model is only mildly affected, and the network behavior remains intact, as expected in the iontophoresis experiment. These computational findings predict that dlPFC Delay cell networks would be particularly sensitive to reductions in NMDAR stimulation, with even small reductions in NMDAR conductance greatly diminishing task-related network firing. The roles of ionotropic glutamate receptors on task-related neuronal firing were studied in monkeys performing an oculomotor delayed response (ODR) task (Figure 1A); patients with schizophrenia show deficits on this task (Keedy et al., 2006Keedy S.K. Ebens C.L. Keshavan M.S. Sweeney J.A. Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies of eye movements in first episode schizophrenia: smooth pursuit, visually guided saccades and the oculomotor delayed response task.Psychiatry Res. 2006; 146: 199-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In ODR, monkeys remember an ever-changing cued location over a brief delay and then make an eye movement to the remembered location to receive a juice reward (Figure 1A). Single-unit recordings were made from the principal sulcal dlPFC subregion essential for spatial working memory (Goldman-Rakic, 1995Goldman-Rakic P.S. Cellular basis of working memory.Neuron. 1995; 14: 477-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1860) Google Scholar) (Figure 1B). We classified cells into one of three types based on their patterns of task-related firing: (1) Cue cells that briefly fire during the visuospatial cue, (2) Delay cells that maintain persistent firing through the delay period, and often fire to the cue and/or response as well, and (3) Response cells (likely layer V; Sawaguchi et al., 1989Sawaguchi T. Matsumura M. Kubota K. Depth distribution of neuronal activity related to a visual reaction time task in the monkey prefrontal cortex.J. Neurophysiol. 1989; 61: 435-446PubMed Google Scholar) that fire during or after the saccadic response to the remembered location (Goldman-Rakic, 1995Goldman-Rakic P.S. Cellular basis of working memory.Neuron. 1995; 14: 477-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1860) Google Scholar). The persistent firing of Delay cells is often spatially tuned to a “preferred direction,” (Figure 1C), arising from recurrent excitation within a microcircuit of layer III pyramidal cells with similar tuning (Figure 1D; Goldman-Rakic, 1995Goldman-Rakic P.S. Cellular basis of working memory.Neuron. 1995; 14: 477-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1860) Google Scholar), which interconnect on dendritic spines (Figure 1E). The spatial tuning of the network is sculpted by GABA and dopamine (Goldman-Rakic, 1995Goldman-Rakic P.S. Cellular basis of working memory.Neuron. 1995; 14: 477-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1860) Google Scholar; Vijayraghavan et al., 2007Vijayraghavan S. Wang M. Birnbaum S.G. Williams G.V.

Neurosci. 2007; 10: 376-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar), e.g., the basket cell (B) shown in Figure 1D. Drugs were applied using iontophoresis; the iontophoresis electrode consisted of a central carbon fiber for recording, surrounded by six glass pipettes that deliver drug by applying a small electrical current. A minute amount of drug is released that affects cells on the spatial scale of a cortical column (Rao et al., 2000Rao S.G. Williams G.V. Goldman-Rakic P.S. Destruction and creation of spatial tuning by disinhibition: GABA(A) blockade of prefrontal cortical neurons engaged by working memory.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 485-494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but does not alter behavior; iontophoresis of saline with low pH similar to the drug solutions used in this study has no effect on neuronal firing (Vijayraghavan et al., 2007Vijayraghavan S. Wang M. Birnbaum S.G. Williams G.V. Arnsten A.F.T. Inverted-U dopamine D1 receptor actions on prefrontal neurons engaged in working memory.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 376-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar; Figure S2). The role of NMDARs was probed using three different NMDAR antagonists: the noncompetitive, general NMDA antagonist MK801; the selective NR2A NMDA subunit antagonist PPPA ((2R∗,4S∗)-4-(3-Phosphonopropyl)-2-piperidinecarboxylic acid); and the selective NR2B NMDA subunit antagonist Ro25-6981. A brief pilot study also examined the effects of stimulating NMDAR by iontophoresis of NMDA. Iontophoresis of the NMDA antagonist MK801 produced a marked, dose-dependent suppression of neuronal firing (Figures 3A–3C, Figure S3; one-way ANOVA with repeated measures [1-ANOVA-R], p < 0.05 for 14 out of 15 individual cells; Tdep for the average, p < 10−5). Firing was reduced for all task epochs, with higher doses producing an almost complete suppression of network firing in some neurons (Figures 3A and 3B). Firing was preferentially reduced on preferred direction trials, thus leading to a significant decrease in the neuron’s spatial tuning index (TI) (Figure 2C; Tdep, p < 0.01; Wilcoxon, p = 0.012). Thus, neurons no longer maintained information regarding spatial position of the cue. Firing slowly returned to normal firing patterns when drug application was stopped (Figure 3A; 1-ANOVA-R, p < 0.05; drug versus recovery). In contrast to task-related firing, iontophoresis of MK801 produced only a small, nonsignificant reduction in spontaneous neuronal firing when the monkey rested (average spontaneous firing rate control: 9.28 ± 3.93; MK801: 7.12 ± 3.29; p = 0.12).Figure 3The Effects of Intra-PFC Iontophoresis of the NMDA Antagonists MK801 or Ro25-6981 on the Task-Related Firing of Delay Cells in the Primate dlPFCShow full caption(A) An example of an individual dlPFC Delay cell under control conditions and after iontophoresis of MK801 (25 nA).

In contrast to blockade of NMDAR, stimulation of NMDAR through iontophoresis of NMDA increased Delay cell firing (Figure S4). A very low dose of NMDA (5 nA) produced a specific enhancement of firing for the neurons’ preferred direction; however, higher doses (10–40 nA) produced nonspecific increases in neuronal firing (Figure S4). The generalized increases in firing at higher doses probably arose from the widespread effects of exogenous drug application and emphasizes that blockade of endogenous glutamate actions is the more effective strategy for illuminating innate glutamate actions in primate dlPFC. Iontophoresis of either PPPA (Figure S5) or Ro25-6981 (Figures 3D and 3E) markedly reduced Delay cell firing. As computational models predicted an important role for NR2B receptors, we focused on this subtype. Extended studies of Ro25-6981 revealed dose-related reductions in task-related firing (Figures 3D and 3E; 1-ANOVA-R, p < 0.05 for 26 out of 31 individual cells; Tdep for the average, p < 109). Reduced firing was particularly evident for the neurons’ preferred direction, leading to a significant decrease in the spatial tuning index (Figure 3F; Tdep, p < 10−5; Wilcoxon, p < 0.0001).

https://openalex.org/W2112137180,"Loss of FMRP causes fragile X syndrome (FXS), but the physiological functions of FMRP remain highly debatable. Here we show that FMRP regulates neurotransmitter release in CA3 pyramidal neurons by modulating action potential (AP) duration. Loss of FMRP leads to excessive AP broadening during repetitive activity, enhanced presynaptic calcium influx, and elevated neurotransmitter release. The AP broadening defects caused by FMRP loss have a cell-autonomous presynaptic origin and can be acutely rescued in postnatal neurons. These presynaptic actions of FMRP are translation independent and are mediated selectively by BK channels via interaction of FMRP with BK channel's regulatory β4 subunits. Information-theoretical analysis demonstrates that loss of these FMRP functions causes marked dysregulation of synaptic information transmission. FMRP-dependent AP broadening is not limited to the hippocampus, but also occurs in cortical pyramidal neurons. Our results thus suggest major translation-independent presynaptic functions of FMRP that may have important implications for understanding FXS neuropathology."
https://openalex.org/W2029360579,"The capsaicin receptor, TRPV1, is regulated by phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)), although the precise nature of this effect (i.e., positive or negative) remains controversial. Here, we reconstitute purified TRPV1 into artificial liposomes, where it is gated robustly by capsaicin, protons, spider toxins, and, notably, heat, demonstrating intrinsic sensitivity of the channel to both chemical and thermal stimuli. TRPV1 is fully functional in the absence of phosphoinositides, arguing against their proposed obligatory role in channel activation. Rather, introduction of various phosphoinositides, including PIP(2), PI4P, and phosphatidylinositol, inhibits TRPV1, supporting a model whereby phosphoinositide turnover contributes to thermal hyperalgesia by disinhibiting the channel. Using an orthogonal chemical strategy, we show that association of the TRPV1 C terminus with the bilayer modulates channel gating, consistent with phylogenetic data implicating this domain as a key regulatory site for tuning stimulus sensitivity. Beyond TRPV1, these findings are relevant to understanding how membrane lipids modulate other ""receptor-operated"" TRP channels."
https://openalex.org/W2055340966,"Common agricultural birds are in decline, both in Europe and in North America. Evidence from Europe suggests that agricultural intensification and, for some species, the indirect effects of pesticides mediated through a loss of insect food resource is in part responsible. On a state-by-state basis for the conterminous Unites States (U.S.), we looked at several agronomic variables to predict the number of grassland species increasing or declining according to breeding bird surveys conducted between 1980 and 2003. Best predictors of species declines were the lethal risk from insecticide use modeled from pesticide impact studies, followed by the loss of cropped pasture. Loss of permanent pasture or simple measures of agricultural intensification such as the proportion of land under crop or the proportion of farmland treated with herbicides did not explain bird declines as well. Because the proportion of farmland treated with insecticides, and more particularly the lethal risk to birds from the use of current insecticides feature so prominently in the best models, this suggests that, in the U.S. at least, pesticide toxicity to birds should be considered as an important factor in grassland bird declines."

Here we show that cholinergic basal forebrain projections to V1 are necessary for the neural acquisition, but not the expression, of reward timing in the visual cortex of awake, behaving animals. We then mimic reward timing in vitro by pairing white matter stimulation with muscarinic receptor activation at a fixed interval and show that this protocol results in the prolongation of electrically evoked spike train durations out to the conditioned interval. Together, these data suggest that V1 possesses the circuitry and plasticity to support reward time prediction learning and the cholinergic system serves as an important reinforcement signal which, in vivo, conveys to the cortex the outcome of behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1980645035,"The uncarboxylated form (ucOC), but not the γ-carboxylated form (GlaOC), of the bone-derived protein osteocalcin stimulates insulin secretion and regulates energy metabolism in insulin target tissues. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an insulin secretagogue that is released from the gut in response to food intake. We have now found that Gprc6a, a putative ucOC receptor, is expressed in epithelial cells of the mouse small intestine as well as in STC-1 enteroendocrine cells. Secretion of GLP-1 by STC-1 cells was stimulated by ucOC but not by GlaOC. The serum GLP-1 concentration in mice was increased by intraperitoneal or oral administration of ucOC, whereas GlaOC was effective in this regard only after oral application. Serum insulin levels were also increased by ucOC, and this effect was potentiated by an inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase IV and blocked by a GLP-1 receptor antagonist. Intravenous injection of ucOC in mice increased the serum GLP-1 concentration, and also increased the serum level of insulin. Our results suggest that ucOC acts via Gprc6a to induce GLP-1 release from the gut, and that the stimulatory effect of ucOC on insulin secretion is largely mediated by GLP-1."
https://openalex.org/W2059999696,"Objective The Trail making test (TMT) is culture-loaded because of reliance on the Latin alphabet, limiting its application in Eastern populations. The Shape Trail Test (STT) has been developed as a new variant. This study is to examine the applicability of the STT in a senile Chinese population and to evaluate its potential advantages and disadvantages. Method A total of 2470 participants were recruited, including 1151 cognitively normal control (NC), 898 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and 421 mild Alzheimer disease (AD) patients. Besides the STT, the Mini mental state examination and a comprehensive neuropsychological battery involving memory, language, attention, executive function and visuospatial ability were administered to all the participants. In a subgroup of 100 NC and 50 AD patients, both the STT and the Color Trail Test (CTT) were performed. Results In NC, the time consumed for Part A and B (STT-A and STT-B) significantly correlated with age and negatively correlated with education (p<0.01). STT-A and B significantly differed among the AD, aMCI and NC. The number that successfully connected within one minute in Part B (STT-B-1 min) correlated well with STT-B (r = 0.71, p<0.01) and distinguished well among NC, aMCI and AD. In the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the AUCs (area under the curve) for STT-A, STT-B, and STT-B-1min in identifying AD were 0.698, 0.694 and 0.709, respectively. The STT correlated with the CTT, but the time for completion was longer. Conclusion The TMT is a sensitive test of visual search and sequencing. The STT is a meaningful attempt to develop a “culture-fair” variant of the TMT in addition to the CTT."

We challenge this view by showing that hippocampal parvalbumin-positive basket cells (PV-BCs) of the CA1 region express long-term (>30 min) potentiation of intrinsic neuronal excitability (LTP-IEPV-BC) upon brief repetitive stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals. LTP-IEPV-BC is induced by synaptic activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5) and mediated by the downregulation of Kv1 channel activity. LTP-IEPV-BC promotes spiking activity at the gamma frequency (∼35 Hz) and facilitates recruitment of PV-BCs to balance synaptic and intrinsic excitation in pyramidal neurons.

Scanziani M. How inhibition shapes cortical activity.Neuron. 2011; 72: 231-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). This excitatory-inhibitory balance is thought to maintain activity within physiological bounds and shape cortical activity in space and time. Excitatory-inhibitory balance can be transiently perturbed by learning but generally recovers after a few tens of minutes (Froemke et al., 2007Froemke R.C. Merzenich M.M. Schreiner C.E.

Classically, activity-dependent plasticity of inhibitory circuits is thought to be achieved by the persistent enhancement of excitatory synaptic drive to inhibitory interneurons (Alle et al., 2001Alle H.

However, functional plasticity might also be achieved through the regulation of voltage-gated ion channels that control synaptic integration and spike initiation (Debanne and Poo, 2010Debanne D.

Bidirectional plasticity in fast-spiking GABA circuits by visual experience.Nature. 2009; 462: 218-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). We show here that in area CA1 feed-forward inhibition is mostly enhanced by high-frequency stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals through a persistent increase in intrinsic neuronal excitability in a subset of GABAergic interneurons of the CA1 region. This intrinsic plasticity requires synaptic stimulation of metabotropic glutamate receptor type 5 and is mediated by the downregulation of voltage-gated potassium channels. We recorded from CA1 pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slice (see Experimental Procedures). Compound excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials were evoked by stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals (Figure 1A; see Figure S1 available online). High-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the Schaffer collaterals (10 trains of 10 pulses at 100 Hz, delivered at a frequency of 0.3 Hz) resulted not only in potentiation of synaptic excitation, but also increased disynaptic inhibition in CA1 pyramidal neurons (Figure 1A). Monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) onto interneurons that are initially subthreshold may cross the spike threshold after HFS. In order to test this hypothesis, fast-spiking interneurons were recorded in whole-cell configuration in the stratum pyramidale of the CA1 region (see Experimental Procedures). Their resting membrane potential was −67.6 ± 0.7 mV (n = 12). The great majority of these cells were parvalbumin-positive (10/12; Figure 1B). Their axonal arborization, labeled with biocytin, was confined within the pyramidal cell layer (9/9; Figure 1B), indicating that they were putative parvalbumin-positive basket cells (PV-BCs; (Freund and Katona, 2007Freund T.F.

Neurosci. 2010; 31: 2234-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar)). PV-BCs typically fired action potentials (APs) in clusters and the first spike, upon a slow depolarizing ramp, occurred generally with a delay (Goldberg et al., 2008Goldberg E.M. Clark B.D. Zagha E. Nahmani M. Erisir A. Rudy B. K+ channels at the axon initial segment dampen near-threshold excitability of neocortical fast-spiking GABAergic interneurons.Neuron. 2008; 58: 387-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We first examined whether recruitment of PV-BCs was altered after HFS. Initially, the probability of evoking an AP by the synaptic input was very low (0.07 ± 0.06, n = 5), indicating that they were not recruited by excitatory inputs before HFS. In contrast, the firing probability markedly increased 15–30 min after HFS (to 0.50 ± 0.15, n = 5; Wilcoxon, p < 0.07; Figure 1C), showing that PV-BCs were recruited by the stimulated synaptic pathway. We next examined whether the origin of this increased firing was synaptic or intrinsic. Excitatory synaptic transmission was found to be enhanced after HFS (155% ± 7% of the control EPSP slope, n = 5; Figure 1D), suggesting that the observed facilitation in spiking activity may partly result from facilitation in synaptic excitation. To determine whether intrinsic excitability was enhanced in PV-BCs, synaptic circuits were bypassed by directly simulating families of near-threshold EPSPs in PV-BC with the dynamic-clamp technique (Figure 1E). The input-output function of PV-BCs was found to be strengthened 15–30 min after HFS (Figure 1E). These data indicate that intrinsic neuronal excitability of PV-BC is persistently enhanced, independently of any modification in excitatory synaptic circuits. Next, we estimated the respective contributions of synaptic and intrinsic changes in the recruitment of PV-BC after HFS. Synaptic and intrinsic changes were estimated from the EPSP-spike curves established before and 10–30 min after HFS. The firing probability was measured on the control and post-HFS curves for the initial value of EPSP-slope (3.4 mV/ms; gray arrow in Figure 1F) and for that obtained after HFS (5.4 mV/ms; red arrow in Figure 1F). The data indicate that a large proportion (∼80%) of the increased firing probability results from an increase in intrinsic excitability. In order to fully characterize the induction and expression mechanisms of this novel form of intrinsic plasticity in PV-BCs, moderate spiking activity (8–10 spikes) was triggered with pulses of depolarizing current (800 ms). To verify that the HFS-induced increase in intrinsic neuronal excitability did not result from a change in background GABAergic inhibition, experiments were performed in the presence of the GABAA channel blocker, picrotoxin (100 μM). After recording a stable baseline, high frequency stimulation (HFS) was delivered to the synaptic pathway. HFS produced a transient increase in spike number (247% ± 29% of the control, n = 9, measured at +1 min) followed by a stable plateau of enhanced excitability (209% ± 41% of the control spike number, n = 9, measured at 25–30 min; Figure 2A). While the short-term increase in excitability was associated with a transient depolarization of the membrane potential by ∼2–3 mV (104% ± 1% of the control membrane potential measured at +2 min), the long-term component (LTP-IEPV-BC) measured at 25–30 min was totally independent of any change in membrane potential (100.1% ± 0.5%, n = 9) or input resistance (99% ± 2%, n = 9). Other subthreshold parameters such as the membrane time constant (τm = 20.1 ± 2.4 ms before HFS and 20.4 ± 2.1 ms after, Wilcoxon p > 0.5; Figure S2) or the resonance properties (Figure S2) remained unchanged after induction of LTP-IEPV-BC. Firing accommodation was not altered after induction of LTP-IEPV-BC (first ISI / last ISI: 1.44 ± 0.27 before and 1.19 ± 0.11 after HFS; Wilcoxon p > 0.5). No change in excitability was observed in the absence of HFS (107% ± 1%, n = 7; Wilcoxon p > 0.05; Figure S2). Long-term synaptic modifications in hippocampal interneurons require a wide range of glutamate receptors including ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors (Kullmann and Lamsa, 2007Kullmann D.M. Lamsa K.P. Long-term synaptic plasticity in hippocampal interneurons.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 687-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar; Pelletier and Lacaille, 2008Pelletier J.G. Lacaille J.C. Long-term synaptic plasticity in hippocampal feedback inhibitory networks.Prog. Brain Res. 2008; 169: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To test whether AMPA or NMDA receptors are required for LTP-IEPV-BC induction, HFS was delivered in the presence of 2 mM kynurenate. Although the transient component was diminished (137% ± 7% of the control, n = 9, measured at +1 min), no significant reduction in LTP-IEPV-BC was observed (211% ± 20%, n = 11, measured at 25–30 min, Mann-Whitney U test, p > 0.2); Figure 2B), indicating that NMDA and AMPA receptor activation does not play a critical role in LTP-IEPV-BC. Next, the role of metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) activation was tested. HFS failed to induce LTP-IEPV-BC in the presence of 2 mM kynurenate and 10 μM of the mGluR type 5-selective antagonist, MPEP (97% ± 11%, n = 9) or in the presence of MPEP alone (10 μM; 111% ± 7% n = 5; Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.05; Figure 2C). LTP-IEPV-BC was also observed following brief application of the mGluR1/5 agonist, DHPG (20 μM; 169% ± 42%, n = 5) or the mGluR5 agonist CHPG (200–500 μM; 297% ± 72%, n = 9; Figure 3A). To verify that other neurotransmitter/neuromodulators were not necessary to the induction of LTP-IEPV-BC, experiments were performed in the presence of the broad spectrum calcium channel blocker cadmium. Cadmium (50 μM) totally abolished evoked synaptic responses. In the presence of cadmium, CHPG (500 μM) still induced an increase in excitability that was similar to that induced in control saline (199% ± 45%, n = 7, Mann-Whitney U test, p > 0.5; Figure 3B). Thus, although AMPA/NMDA receptors are involved in the short-term increase in excitability in PV-BCs, activation of mGluR5 is necessary and sufficient for the induction of LTP-IEPV-BC. We next investigated the expression mechanisms of LTP-IEPV-BC. Fast spiking PV-BCs display delayed firing, which is a typical hallmark of the slowly inactivating D-type K+ current mediated by Kv1 channels (Cudmore et al., 2010Cudmore R.H. Fronzaroli-Molinieres L. Giraud P. Debanne D. Spike-time precision and network synchrony are controlled by the homeostatic regulation of the D-type potassium current.J.

Neurosci. 2012; 15: 267-273Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar). A striking feature of LTP-IEPV-BC induced by HFS or application of mGluR agonist is the marked reduction (∼50%) in the latency of the first spike (Figures 4A and 4B ). The temporal change in firing was analyzed on spike histograms. In fact, both phasic (100–300 ms) and tonic spiking activity increased (Figure 4C). The reduced delay in the first spike latency suggests that the D-type potassium current (ID) carried by Kv1 channel is downregulated following LTP-IEPV-BC induction. In fact, PV-positive interneurons in the stratum pyramidale were found to express high levels of Kv1.1 (Figure 5A) and Kv1.2 (Figure S3) channels in both the cell body and their axon initial segment (AIS). Blocking Kv1 channels with 4-AP (5–10 μM) or DTx-I (100–150 nM) reduced the first spike latency (21% ± 11% of the control, n = 15) and strongly increased spiking activity (402% ± 45% of the control spike number, n = 15; Figure 5B), thus mimicking LTP-IEPV-BC. The reduced delay in the first spike suggests that the D-type potassium current (ID) carried by Kv1 channel is downregulated following LTP-IEPV-BC induction. If this hypothesis is correct, LTP-IEPV-BC should be occluded by the pharmacological inactivation of ID. In fact, in the presence of 100–150 nM DTx-I or 5–10 μM 4-AP, HFS failed to induce LTP-IEPV-BC (102% ± 8%, n = 7, and 106% ± 4%, n = 5, respectively; Figures 5C and S3). In these experiments, the amplitude of the current step was adjusted to elicit a non-saturating number of spikes in control conditions (8–10 spikes/s; Figures 5C and S3). Furthermore, the delay to the first spike remained unchanged in the presence of Kv1 channel blockers (4-AP: 89% ± 8%, n = 5, and DTx-I: 126% ± 22%, n = 7; Figure S3), indicating that all features of LTP-IEPV-BC are suppressed when Kv1 channels are blocked. We next examined the cellular mechanism of mGluR5-dependent regulation of Kv1. The translation of Kv1.1 channel mRNA and surface expression of Kv1.1 channels is strongly inhibited by the mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR (Raab-Graham et al., 2006Raab-Graham K.F. Haddick P.C. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Activity- and mTOR-dependent suppression of Kv1.1 channel mRNA translation in dendrites.Science. 2006; 314: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). mTOR is also activated by mGluR5 through the PI3K/Akt pathway (Klann and Dever, 2004Klann E. Dever T.E. Biochemical mechanisms for translational regulation in synaptic plasticity.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 931-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether LTP-IEPV-BC was affected by the inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin. LTP-IEPV-BC was significantly reduced in PV-BCs treated for 2 hr with rapamycin (50 nM; 122% ± 20%, n = 5, versus 212% ± 29%, n = 8, Wilcoxon, p < 0.07; Figure 5D). We conclude that LTP-IEPV-BC is expressed through an mGluR5-dependent downregulation of Kv1 channel activity involving mTOR. Kv1 channels are generally localized at the AIS where they control the spike threshold (Goldberg et al., 2008Goldberg E.M. Clark B.D. Zagha E. Nahmani M. Erisir A. Rudy B.

We therefore examined whether changes in spike threshold occurred following induction of LTP-IEPV-BC. As reported earlier, the voltage threshold of the first AP was relatively depolarized (−35.7 ± 1.1 mV, n = 9). It is noteworthy that the spike threshold was found to be hyperpolarized by 3.9 ± 1.1 mV (n = 9), 15–30 min after HFS (Figure 6A). These data indicate that the global responsiveness of PV-BCs is enhanced following HFS and that subthreshold EPSPs might be able to elicit an action potential after induction of LTP-IEPV-BC. The HFS-induced hyperpolarization of the spike threshold was perfectly mimicked by pharmacological inactivation of Kv1 channels with DTx-I. The voltage threshold of the first AP was hyperpolarized by 11.1 ± 1.1 mV (n = 9) in the presence of DTx-I (Figure 6B). Similar changes in firing profile were obtained in a model of PV-BC upon blockade of Kv1 channels at the axon or the cell body (Figure S4), suggesting that regulation of axonal or somatic Kv1 channels may equally account for LTP-IEPV-BC (Golomb et al., 2007Golomb D. Donner K. Shacham L. Shlosberg D. Amitai Y. Hansel D. Mechanisms of firing patterns in fast-spiking cortical interneurons.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2007; 3: e156Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, change in spike threshold reached the level observed experimentally only if Kv1 channels were suppressed in the axon. In order to further confirm that PV-BC recruitment was enhanced by the Kv1-dependent hyperpolarization of the spike threshold, we examined the effect of the pharmacological blockade of Kv1 on disynaptic inhibition. As expected, DTx-I mimicked the effect of HFS by increasing disynaptic inhibition in CA1 pyramidal neurons (Figure 6C). Interestingly, the enhanced disynaptic inhibition induced by HFS or by CHPG was importantly reduced or occluded by DTx-I (HFS; 186% ± 13%, n = 6, versus 323% ± 19%, n = 7, in control; CHPG: 96% ± 8%, n = 7, versus 147% ± 8%, n = 7, in control; Figure 6D). Thus, these data confirm that the facilitation of feed-forward inhibition is predominantly mediated by the regulation of intrinsic excitability. We conclude that mGluR5 and Kv1-dependent LTP-IEPV-BC promote disynaptic inhibition in CA1 circuits. Fast-spiking PV-BCs display a specific mode of firing composed of sparse and clustered APs (Goldberg et al., 2008Goldberg E.M. Clark B.D. Zagha E. Nahmani M. Erisir A. Rudy B. K+ channels at the axon initial segment dampen near-threshold excitability of neocortical fast-spiking GABAergic interneurons.Neuron. 2008; 58: 387-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Sparse spikes (Sps) typically occurred in our recordings after a slow depolarizing ramp of potential at an instantaneous frequency of ∼10 Hz (Figures 7A and S5). In contrast, clustered spikes (Cls) followed immediately an AP and displayed a much more hyperpolarized voltage threshold. Consequently, their instantaneous frequency was much higher and corresponded to the gamma (γ)-frequency range (25–50 Hz). We therefore examined whether Sps and Cls were equally altered following induction of LTP-IEPV-BC. Surprisingly, the enhanced excitability was mostly supported by an increase in the proportion of Cls (from 69% ± 9% to 92% ± 3%; Figure 7A). In fact, a clear gain of spiking activity in the γ frequency range was observed after HFS (Figure 7B). In order to check that the observed changes were not dependent on the type of depolarizing profile, trains of simulated EPSPs were injected in PV-BCs. A similar increase in the γ range was observed after HFS (Figure S5). Thus, mGluR5 stimulation increases intrinsic neuronal excitability of PV-BC and promotes their firing in the γ range. We next determined whether HFS-induced increase in intrinsic excitability was specific to PV-BCs. A second class of interneuron was recorded in the stratum pyramidale of the CA1 region. In contrast to PV-BCs, these interneurons fired regularly (CV of the fifth interspike interval 0.04 ± 0.01, n = 25 versus 0.67 ± 0.10, n = 27 for PV-BCs; Figure 8A), displayed a high input resistance (476 ± 48 MΩ, n = 20 versus 120 ± 9 MΩ n = 22 for PV-BCs, Mann-Whitney U test p < 0.01) and had a low rheobase (56 ± 5 pA, n = 20 versus 204 ± 13 pA, n = 22 for PV-BCs, Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.01). None of regular spiking (RS) neurons expressed PV (0/13; Figure 8B). Most importantly, HFS failed to induce LTP-IE in these interneurons (91% ± 4%, n = 7; Figure 8C). Furthermore, bath application of the type I mGluR agonist, DHPG (20 μM) or the specific mGluR5 agonist CHPG (200–500 μM) induced no increase in intrinsic excitability (91% ± 11%, n = 7, and 80% ± 7%, n = 7; Figure S6). Taken together, these results indicate that LTP-IE is specifically expressed in CA1 PV-BCs. We report here an unexpected form of intrinsic plasticity in PV-BCs of the CA1 region. In addition to the short-term increase in excitability reported earlier (Miles and Poncer, 1993Miles R. Poncer J.C. Metabotropic glutamate receptors mediate a post-tetanic excitation of guinea-pig hippocampal inhibitory neurones.J. Physiol. 1993; 463: 461-473PubMed Google Scholar), HFS also induced a persistent increase in intrinsic neuronal excitability (LTP-IEPV-BC). LTP-IEPV-BC has two major functional consequences. Together with synaptic modification, LTP-IEPV-BC facilitates feed-forward inhibition in CA1 circuits. In addition, it promotes firing in the gamma range. Interestingly, this intrinsic plasticity was absent in another class of parvalbumin-negative interneurons which display regular firing. We show here that HFS of the Schaffer collateral induced a persistent increase in feed-forward inhibition in CA1 pyramidal neurons. The enhanced recruitment of inhibition is likely to be achieved by an increase in the intrinsic excitability of PV-BCs. Initially, PV-BCs are almost silent because of their low input resistance (∼120 MΩ for constant depolarization, but only ∼50 MΩ for oscillatory input at 40 Hz [Figure S2]) and their depolarized spike threshold (−37 mV). Similar values of spike threshold have been reported in PV interneurons (Goldberg et al., 2008Goldberg E.M. Clark B.D. Zagha E. Nahmani M. Erisir A. Rudy B. K+ channels at the axon initial segment dampen near-threshold excitability of neocortical fast-spiking GABAergic interneurons.Neuron. 2008; 58: 387-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The depolarized spike threshold essentially results from the high level of Kv conductance. Blockade of Kv1 channels with DTx-I hyperpolarizes the spike threshold by 11 mV (Figure 6B). Although both synaptic and intrinsic changes contribute to the recruitment of GABAergic inhibition, intrinsic changes take a much larger part in this process. First, EPSP-spike curves reveal that the expected increase in spiking activity resulting from pure synaptic changes is limited to ∼20% whereas intrinsic changes represent ∼80% (Figure 1F). In addition, when Kv1 channels are blocked with DTx-I, the remaining increase in HFS-induced feed-forward inhibition represents only 39% of the control increase, confirming that more than 60% result from modulation of intrinsic excitability. Thus, intrinsic changes represent a powerful means of recruiting PV-BC interneurons in CA1 circuits. HFS of the Schaffer collaterals induced two types of changes in PV-BCs: a short-term increase followed by a plateau of potentiation. The short-term enhancement is concomitant with a postsynaptic depolarization and is also observed upon application of mGluR agonists. This initial component was markedly reduced in the presence of kynurenate. A possible explanation is that the total amount of glutamate release during HFS is reduced in the presence of kynurenate because polysynaptic circuits are most likely blocked. Long-lasting increase in excitability, resulting from persistent cell depolarization has been reported in basket cells of the dentate gyrus (Ross and Soltesz, 2001Ross S.T. Soltesz I. Long-term plasticity in interneurons of the dentate gyrus.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 8874-8879Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In contrast, LTP-IEPV-BC in the CA1 region is independent of any depolarization of the recorded neuron. We show that LTP-IEPV-BC is mediated by an mGluR5-dependent reduction in Kv1 channel activity, possibly resulting from the mTOR-dependent disruption of Kv1.1 channel turnover (Raab-Graham et al., 2006Raab-Graham K.F. Haddick P.C. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Activity- and mTOR-dependent suppression of Kv1.1 channel mRNA translation in dendrites.Scien"
https://openalex.org/W2041334904,"Mammalian articular cartilage serves diverse functions, including shock absorption, force transmission and enabling low-friction joint motion. These challenging requirements are met by the tissue’s thickness combined with its highly specific extracellular matrix, consisting of a glycosaminoglycan-interspersed collagen fiber network that provides a unique combination of resilience and high compressive and shear resistance. It is unknown how this critical tissue deals with the challenges posed by increases in body mass. For this study, osteochondral cores were harvested post-mortem from the central sites of both medial and lateral femoral condyles of 58 different mammalian species ranging from 25 g (mouse) to 4000 kg (African elephant). Joint size and cartilage thickness were measured and biochemical composition (glycosaminoclycan, collagen and DNA content) and collagen cross-links densities were analyzed. Here, we show that cartilage thickness at the femoral condyle in the mammalian species investigated varies between 90 µm and 3000 µm and bears a negative allometric relationship to body mass, unlike the isometric scaling of the skeleton. Cellular density (as determined by DNA content) decreases with increasing body mass, but gross biochemical composition is remarkably constant. This however need not affect life-long performance of the tissue in heavier mammals, due to relatively constant static compressive stresses, the zonal organization of the tissue and additional compensation by joint congruence, posture and activity pattern of larger mammals. These findings provide insight in the scaling of articular cartilage thickness with body weight, as well as in cartilage biochemical composition and cellularity across mammalian species. They underscore the need for the use of appropriate in vivo models in translational research aiming at human applications."
https://openalex.org/W2132662156,"Abnormalities during brain development are thought to cause psychiatric illness and other neurodevelopmental disorders. However, developmental processes such as neurogenesis continue in restricted brain regions of adults, and disruptions of these processes could contribute to the phenotypes of neurodevelopmental disorders. As previously reported, we show that Disc1 knockdown specifically in adult-born dentate gyrus (DG) neurons results in increased mTOR signaling, hyperexcitability, and neuronal structure deficits. Disc1 knockdown also resulted in pronounced cognitive and affective deficits, which could be reversed when the affected DG neurons were inactivated. Importantly, reversing increases in mTOR signaling with an FDA-approved inhibitor both prevented and treated these behavioral deficits, even when associated structural deficits were not reversed. Our findings suggest that a component of the affective and cognitive phenotypes in neurodevelopmental disorders may be caused by disruptions in adult-born neurons. Consequently, treatments directed at this cell population may have a significant impact on these phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2007788777,"Troyer syndrome is a hereditary spastic paraplegia caused by human spartin (SPG20) gene mutations. We have generated a Drosophila disease model showing that Spartin functions presynaptically with endocytic adaptor Eps15 to regulate synaptic growth and function. Spartin inhibits bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling by promoting endocytic degradation of BMP receptor wishful thinking (Wit). Drosophila fragile X mental retardation protein (dFMRP) and Futsch/MAP1B are downstream effectors of Spartin and BMP signaling in regulating microtubule stability and synaptic growth. Loss of Spartin or elevation of BMP signaling induces age-dependent progressive defects resembling hereditary spastic paraplegias, including motor dysfunction and brain neurodegeneration. Null spartin phenotypes are prevented by administration of the microtubule-destabilizing drug vinblastine. Together, these results demonstrate that Spartin regulates both synaptic development and neuronal survival by controlling microtubule stability via the BMP-dFMRP-Futsch pathway, suggesting that impaired regulation of microtubule stability is a core pathogenic component in Troyer syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2032285200,"Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder and cause of significant morbidity and mortality. Although antiseizure medication is the first-line treatment for epilepsy, currently available medications are ineffective in a significant percentage of patients and have not clearly been demonstrated to have disease-specific effects for epilepsy. While seizures are usually intractable to medication in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a common genetic cause of epilepsy, vigabatrin appears to have unique efficacy for epilepsy in TSC. While vigabatrin increases gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels, the precise mechanism of action of vigabatrin in TSC is not known. In this study, we investigated the effects of vigabatrin on epilepsy in a knock-out mouse model of TSC and tested the novel hypothesis that vigabatrin inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, a key signaling pathway that is dysregulated in TSC. We found that vigabatrin caused a modest increase in brain GABA levels and inhibited seizures in the mouse model of TSC. Furthermore, vigabatrin partially inhibited mTOR pathway activity and glial proliferation in the knock-out mice in vivo, as well as reduced mTOR pathway activation in cultured astrocytes from both knock-out and control mice. This study identifies a potential novel mechanism of action of an antiseizure medication involving the mTOR pathway, which may account for the unique efficacy of this drug for a genetic epilepsy."
https://openalex.org/W1983889109,"Abiotic stress poses a huge, ever-increasing problem to plants and agriculture. The dissection of signalling pathways mediating stress tolerance is a prerequisite to develop more resistant plant species. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are universal signalling modules. In Arabidopsis, the MAPK MPK3 and its upstream regulator MAPK kinase MKK4 initiate the adaptation response to numerous abiotic and biotic stresses. Yet, molecular steps directly linked with MKK4 – MPK3 activation are largely unknown. Starting with a yeast-two-hybrid screen for interacting partners of MKK4, we identified a transcription factor, MYB44. MYB44 is controlled at multiple levels by and strongly inter-connected with MAPK signalling. As we had shown earlier, stress-induced expression of the MYB44 gene is regulated by a MPK3-targeted bZIP transcription factor VIP1. At the protein level, MYB44 interacts with MPK3 in vivo. MYB44 is phosphorylated by MPK3 in vitro at a single residue, Ser145. Although replacement of Ser145 by a non-phosphorylatable (S145A) or phosphomimetic (S145D) residue did not alter MYB44 subcellular localisation, dimerization behaviour nor DNA-binding characteristics, abiotic stress tolerance tests in stable transgenic Arabidopsis plants clearly related S145 phosphorylation to MYB44 function: Compared to Arabidopsis wild type plants, MYB44 overexpressing lines exhibit an enhanced tolerance to osmotic stress and are slightly more sensitive to abscisic acid. Interestingly, overexpression of the S145A variant revealed that impaired phosphorylation does not render the MYB44 protein non-functional. Instead, S145A lines are highly sensitive to abiotic stress, and thereby remarkably similar to mpk3-deficient plants. Its in vivo interaction with the nuclear sub-pools of both MPK3 and MKK4 renders MYB44 the first plant transcription factor to have a second function as putative MAPK cascade scaffolding protein."

https://openalex.org/W2013210324,"Ecological habitats with greater structural complexity contain more species due to increased niche diversity. This is especially apparent on coral reefs where individual coral colonies aggregate to give a reef its morphology, species zonation, and three dimensionality. Structural complexity is classically measured with a reef rugosity index, which is the ratio of a straight line transect to the distance a flexible chain of equal length travels when draped over the reef substrate; yet, other techniques from visual categories to remote sensing have been used to characterize structural complexity at scales from microhabitats to reefscapes. Reef-scale methods either lack quantitative precision or are too time consuming to be routinely practical, while remotely sensed indices are mismatched to the finer scale morphology of coral colonies and reef habitats. In this communication a new digital technique, Digital Reef Rugosity (DRR) is described which utilizes a self-contained water level gauge enabling a diver to quickly and accurately characterize rugosity with non-invasive millimeter scale measurements of coral reef surface height at decimeter intervals along meter scale transects. The precise measurements require very little post-processing and are easily imported into a spreadsheet for statistical analyses and modeling. To assess its applicability we investigated the relationship between DRR and fish community structure at four coral reef sites on Menjangan Island off the northwest corner of Bali, Indonesia and one on mainland Bali to the west of Menjangan Island; our findings show a positive relationship between DRR and fish diversity. Since structural complexity drives key ecological processes on coral reefs, we consider that DRR may become a useful quantitative community-level descriptor to characterize reef complexity."
https://openalex.org/W2001503908,"Emergence of arboviruses could result from their ability to exploit new environments, for example a new host. This ability is facilitated by the high mutation rate occurring during viral genome replication. The last emergence of chikungunya in the Indian Ocean region corroborates this statement since a single viral mutation at the position 226 on the E1 glycoprotein (E1-A226V) was associated with enhanced transmission by the mosquito Aedes albopictus in regions where the major mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti, is absent.We used direct competition assays in vivo to dissect out the mechanisms underlying the selection of E1-226V by Ae. albopictus. When the original variant E1-226A and the newly emerged E1-226V were provided in the same blood-meal at equal titers to both species of mosquitoes, we found that the proportion of both variants was drastically different in the two mosquito species. Following ingestion of the infectious blood-meal, the E1-226V variant was preferentially selected in Ae. albopictus, whereas the E1-226A variant was sometimes favored in Ae. aegypti. Interestingly, when the two variants were introduced into the mosquitoes by intrathoracic inoculations, E1-226V was no longer favored for dissemination and transmission in Ae. albopictus, showing that the midgut barrier plays a key role in E1-226V selection.This study sheds light on the role of the midgut barrier in the selection of novel arbovirus emerging variants. We also bring new insight into how the pre-existing variant E1-226V was selected among other viral variants including E1-226A. Indeed the E1-226V variant present at low levels in natural viral populations could rapidly emerge after being selected in Ae. albopictus at the midgut barrier level."
https://openalex.org/W2065157239,"CD44 is commonly used as a cell surface marker of cancer stem-like cells in epithelial tumours, and we have previously demonstrated the existence of two different CD44(high) cancer stem-like cell populations in squamous cell carcinoma, one having undergone epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and the other maintaining an epithelial phenotype. Alternative splicing of CD44 variant exons generates a great many isoforms, and it is not known which isoforms are expressed on the surface of the two different cancer stem-like cell phenotypes. Here, we demonstrate that cancer stem-like cells with an epithelial phenotype predominantly express isoforms containing the variant exons, whereas the cancer stem-like cells that have undergone an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition down-regulate these variant isoforms and up-regulate expression of the standard CD44 isoform that contains no variant exons. In addition, we find that enzymatic treatments used to dissociate cells from tissue culture or fresh tumour specimens cause destruction of variant CD44 isoforms at the cell surface whereas expression of the standard CD44 isoform is preserved. This results in enrichment within the CD44(high) population of cancer stem-like cells that have undergone an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and depletion from the CD44(high) population of cancer stem-like cells that maintain an epithelial phenotype, and therefore greatly effects the characteristics of any cancer stem-like cell population isolated based on expression of CD44. As well as effecting the CD44(high) population, enzymatic treatment also reduces the percentage of the total epithelial cancer cell population staining CD44-positive, with potential implications for studies that aim to use CD44-positive staining as a prognostic indicator. Analyses of the properties of cancer stem-like cells are largely dependent on the ability to accurately identify and assay these populations. It is therefore critical that consideration be given to use of multiple cancer stem-like cell markers and suitable procedures for cell isolation in order that the correct populations are assayed."
https://openalex.org/W2023478720,"Background Bacterial communities that are associated with tropical reef-forming corals are being increasingly recognized for their role in host physiology and health. However, little is known about the microbial diversity of the communities associated with temperate gorgonian corals, even though these communities are key structural components of the ecosystem. In the Northwestern Mediterranean Sea, gorgonians undergo recurrent mass mortalities, but the potential relationship between these events and the structure of the associated bacterial communities remains unexplored. Because microbial assemblages may contribute to the overall health and disease resistance of their host, a detailed baseline of the associated bacterial diversity is required to better understand the functioning of the gorgonian holobiont. Methodology/Principal Findings The bacterial diversity associated with the gorgonian Paramuricea clavata was determined using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism and the construction of clone libraries of the bacterial 16S ribosomal DNA. Three study sites were monitored for 4 years to assess the variability of communities associated with healthy colonies. Bacterial assemblages were highly dominated by one Hahellaceae-related ribotype and exhibited low diversity. While this pattern was mostly conserved through space and time, in summer 2007, a deep shift in microbiota structure toward increased bacterial diversity and the transient disappearance of Hahellaceae was observed. Conclusion/Significance This is the first spatiotemporal study to investigate the bacterial diversity associated with a temperate shallow gorgonian. Our data revealed an established relationship between P. clavata and a specific bacterial group within the Oceanospirillales. These results suggest a potential symbiotic role of Hahellaceae in the host-microbe association, as recently suggested for tropical corals. However, a transient imbalance in bacterial associations can be tolerated by the holobiont without apparent symptoms of disease. The subsequent restoration of the Hahellaceae-dominated community is indicative of the specificity and resilience of the bacteria associated with the gorgonian host."

Emerging evidence demonstrates that klotho has a close relationship with cancers, including lung cancer, breast cancer, etc, by inhibiting the proliferation and promoting apoptosis of cancer cells. Cisplatin has been the most widely used drug in the first-line chemotherapy. However, the increase in cisplatin-resistant cancer cells has become a major obstacle in clinical management of cancers. In our study, we for the first time demonstrated that klotho could attenuate the resistance of lung cancer to cisplatin based chemotherapy and the apoptosis of the resistant cells with klotho overexpression was markedly increased. However, klotho knockdown cells showed enhanced resistance to chemotherapy. Further analysis showed that inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathway with specific inhibitor (LY294002) attenuated the promotive effects on cancer growth following interfering with klotho shRNA. Moreover, we demonstrated that klotho modulated the resistance to cisplatin in a xenograft nude mice model. These observations suggested that klotho could improve the resistance of lung cancer cells to chemotherapy and may serve as a potential target for the gene therapy of lung cancers resistant to cisplatin based chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2076056994,"Cellular interactions between neighboring axons are essential for global topographic map formation. Here we show that axonal interactions also precisely instruct the location of synapses. Motoneurons form en passant synapses in Caenorhabditis elegans. Although axons from the same neuron class significantly overlap, each neuron innervates a unique and tiled segment of the muscle field by restricting its synapses to a distinct subaxonal domain—a phenomenon we term synaptic tiling. Using DA8 and DA9 motoneurons, we found that the synaptic tiling requires the PlexinA4 homolog, PLX-1, and two transmembrane semaphorins. In the plexin or semaphorin mutants, synaptic domains from both neurons expand and overlap with each other without guidance defects. In a semaphorin-dependent manner, PLX-1 is concentrated at the synapse-free axonal segment, delineating the tiling border. Furthermore, plexin inhibits presynapse formation by suppressing synaptic F-actin through its cytoplasmic GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain. Hence, contact-dependent, intra-axonal plexin signaling specifies synaptic circuits by inhibiting synapse formation at the subcellular loci.Video AbstracteyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiJmMTJlMmJiNjAzN2NhOTdmOTJkYTAyM2FjMWIyYWQ0NyIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc3OTUzMTc4fQ.ZgiTVILZ4AClhPB9eh3d4acgmDhdBb9tzILbRYResRNLPDx4bcaKeIkN979ttdCS-cECr-UyH79gH6O3Eb372E2BZxxCdDwwbmdjWoVWWx4GQy6zmgPFnZ7xojaVCF01DRz9dcgZ29JWRYDhYWwyyiCswv9wjq3RF9jlqL-LrR_NdsVc3tJapSgQJ73U8yVs6F3_ejBmgcVOscmnANvVdwIYCSy5tKer-zXApN_EDK1fyXacMsq9jdGRiHMQ7HW-Ccek8KPWrLzEh0J0z3YpOCkPnSBrSoQfkYC7De_mwwyDAsLUdfpcGhAl7hP7-lRunhaaZ8bmJWXQ5AieH1metA(mp4, (75.44 MB) Download video"
https://openalex.org/W2012815103,"Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONs) are a promising nanoplatform for contrast-enhanced MRI. Recently, magnetic particle imaging (MPI) was introduced as a new imaging modality, which is able to directly visualize magnetic particles and could serve as a more sensitive and quantitative alternative to MRI. However, MPI requires magnetic particles with specific magnetic properties for optimal use. Current commercially available iron oxide formulations perform suboptimal in MPI, which is triggering research into optimized synthesis strategies. Most synthesis procedures aim at size control of iron oxide nanoparticles rather than control over the magnetic properties. In this study, we report on the synthesis, characterization and application of a novel ION platform for sensitive MPI and MRI.IONs were synthesized using a thermal-decomposition method and subsequently phase-transferred by encapsulation into lipidic micelles (ION-Micelles). Next, the material and magnetic properties of the ION-Micelles were analyzed. Most notably, vibrating sample magnetometry measurements showed that the effective magnetic core size of the IONs is 16 nm. In addition, magnetic particle spectrometry (MPS) measurements were performed. MPS is essentially zero-dimensional MPI and therefore allows to probe the potential of iron oxide formulations for MPI. ION-Micelles induced up to 200 times higher signal in MPS measurements than commercially available iron oxide formulations (Endorem, Resovist and Sinerem) and thus likely allow for significantly more sensitive MPI. In addition, the potential of the ION-Micelle platform for molecular MPI and MRI was showcased by MPS and MRI measurements of fibrin-binding peptide functionalized ION-Micelles (FibPep-ION-Micelles) bound to blood clots.The presented data underlines the potential of the ION-Micelle nanoplatform for sensitive (molecular) MPI and warrants further investigation of the FibPep-ION-Micelle platform for in vivo, non-invasive imaging of fibrin in preclinical disease models of thrombus-related pathologies and atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2027115789,"Early life events can significantly alter the development of the nociceptive circuit. In fact, clinical work has shown that maternal adversity, in the form of depression, and concomitant selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment influence nociception in infants. The combined effects of maternal adversity and SSRI exposure on offspring nociception may be due to their effects on the developing hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) system. Therefore, the present study investigated long-term effects of maternal adversity and/or SSRI medication use on nociception of adult Sprague-Dawley rat offspring, taking into account involvement of the HPA system. Dams were subject to stress during gestation and were treated with fluoxetine (2×/5 mg/kg/day) prior to parturition and throughout lactation. Four groups of adult male offspring were used: 1. Control+Vehicle, 2. Control+Fluoxetine, 3. Prenatal Stress+Vehicle, 4. Prenatal Stress+Fluoxetine. Results show that post-operative pain, measured as hypersensitivity to mechanical stimuli after hind paw incision, was decreased in adult offspring subject to prenatal stress alone and increased in offspring developmentally exposed to fluoxetine alone. Moreover, post-operative pain was normalized in prenatally stressed offspring exposed to fluoxetine. This was paralleled by a decrease in corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG) levels in prenatally stressed offspring and a normalization of serum CBG levels in prenatally stressed offspring developmentally exposed to fluoxetine. Thus, developmental fluoxetine exposure normalizes the long-term effects of maternal adversity on post-operative pain in offspring and these effects may be due, in part, to the involvement of the HPA system."
https://openalex.org/W1966257353,"Objective Under normoxia, non-malignant cells rely on oxidative phosphorylation for their ATP production, whereas cancer cells rely on Glycolysis; a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect. We aimed to elucidate the mechanisms contributing to the Warburg effect in human breast cancer. Experimental design Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) isoenzymes were profiled using zymography. LDH-B subunit expression was assessed by reverse transcription PCR in cells, and by Immunohistochemistry in breast tissues. LDH-B promoter methylation was assessed by sequencing bisulfite modified DNA. Results Absent or decreased expression of LDH isoenzymes 1-4, were seen in T-47D and MCF7 cells. Absence of LDH-B mRNA was seen in T-47D cells, and its expression was restored following treatment with the demethylating agent 5'Azacytadine. LDH-B promoter methylation was identified in T-47D and MCF7 cells, and in 25/ 25 cases of breast cancer tissues, but not in 5/ 5 cases of normal breast tissues. Absent immuno-expression of LDH-B protein (<10% cells stained), was seen in 23/ 26 (88%) breast cancer cases, and in 4/8 cases of adjacent ductal carcinoma in situ lesions. Exposure of breast cancer cells to hypoxia (1% O2), for 48 hours resulted in significant increases in lactate levels in both MCF7 (14.0 fold, p = 0.002), and T-47D cells (2.9 fold, p = 0.009), but not in MDA-MB-436 (-0.9 fold, p = 0.229), or MCF10AT (1.2 fold, p = 0.09) cells. Conclusions Loss of LDH-B expression is an early and frequent event in human breast cancer occurring due to promoter methylation, and is likely to contribute to an enhanced glycolysis of cancer cells under hypoxia."
https://openalex.org/W1972460604,"Antipsychotic drugs are increasingly used in children and adolescents to treat a variety of psychiatric disorders. However, little is known about the long-term effects of early life antipsychotic drug treatment. Most antipsychotic drugs are potent antagonists or partial agonists of dopamine D2 receptors; atypical antipsychotic drugs also antagonize type 2A serotonin receptors. Dopamine and serotonin regulate many neurodevelopmental processes. Thus, early life antipsychotic drug treatment can, potentially, perturb these processes, causing long-term behavioral- and neurobiological impairments. Here, we treated adolescent, male rats with olanzapine on post-natal days 28-49. As adults, they exhibited impaired working memory, but normal spatial memory, as compared to vehicle-treated control rats. They also showed a deficit in extinction of fear conditioning. Measures of motor activity and skill, habituation to an open field, and affect were normal. In the orbital- and medial prefrontal cortices, parietal cortex, nucleus accumbens core and dentate gyrus, adolescent olanzapine treatment altered the developmental dynamics and mature values of dendritic spine density in a region-specific manner. Measures of motor activity and skill, habituation to an open field, and affect were normal. In the orbital- and medial prefrontal cortices, D1 binding was reduced and binding of GABA(A) receptors with open Cl(-) channels was increased. In medial prefrontal cortex, D2 binding was also increased. The persistence of these changes underscores the importance of improved understanding of the enduring sequelae of pediatric APD treatment as a basis for weighing the benefits and risks of adolescent antipsychotic drug therapy, especially prophylactic treatment in high risk, asymptomatic patients. The long-term changes in neurotransmitter receptor binding and neural circuitry induced by adolescent APD treatment may also cause enduring changes in behavioral- and neurobiological responses to other therapeutic- or illicit psychotropic drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2017445000,"Background Plasmodium falciparum malaria remains a major cause of illness and death in sub-Saharan Africa. Young children bear the brunt of the disease and though older children and adults suffer relatively fewer clinical attacks, they remain susceptible to asymptomatic P. falciparum infection. A better understanding of the host factors associated with immunity to clinical malaria and the ability to sustain asymptomatic P. falciparum infection will aid the development of improved strategies for disease prevention. Methods and Findings Here we investigate whether full differential blood counts can predict susceptibility to clinical malaria among Kenyan children sampled at five annual cross-sectional surveys. We find that the ratio of monocytes to lymphocytes, measured in peripheral blood at the time of survey, directly correlates with risk of clinical malaria during follow-up. This association is evident among children with asymptomatic P. falciparum infection at the time the cell counts are measured (Hazard ratio (HR) = 2.7 (95% CI 1.42, 5.01, P = 0.002) but not in those without detectable parasitaemia (HR = 1.0 (95% CI 0.74, 1.42, P = 0.9). Conclusions We propose that the monocyte to lymphocyte ratio, which is easily derived from routine full differential blood counts, reflects an individual's capacity to mount an effective immune response to P. falciparum infection."
https://openalex.org/W2061967634,"The cold inducible RNA binding protein (CIRBP) responds to a wide array of cellular stresses, including short wavelength ultraviolet light (UVC), at the transcriptional and post-translational level. CIRBP can bind the 3'untranslated region of specific transcripts to stabilize them and facilitate their transport to ribosomes for translation. Here we used RNA interference and oligonucleotide microarrays to identify potential downstream targets of CIRBP induced in response to UVC. Twenty eight transcripts were statistically increased in response to UVC and these exhibited a typical UVC response. Only 5 of the 28 UVC-induced transcripts exhibited a CIRBP-dependent pattern of expression. Surprisingly, 3 of the 5 transcripts (IL1B, IL8 and TNFAIP6) encoded proteins important in inflammation with IL-1β apparently contributing to IL8 and TNFAIP6 expression in an autocrine fashion. UVC-induced IL1B expression could be inhibited by pharmacological inhibition of NFκB suggesting that CIRBP was affecting NF-κB signaling as opposed to IL1B mRNA stability directly. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used as an activator of NF-κB to further study the potential link between CIRBP and NFκB. Transfection of siRNAs against CIRBP reduced the extent of the LPS-induced phosphorylation of IκBα, NF-κB DNA binding activity and IL-1β expression. The present work firmly establishes a novel link between CIRBP and NF-κB signaling in response to agents with diverse modes of action. These results have potential implications for disease states associated with inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W1999439651,"A prerequisite for adaptive goal-directed behavior is that animals constantly evaluate action outcomes and relate them to both their antecedent behavior and to stimuli predictive of reward or non-reward. Here, we investigate whether single neurons in the avian nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL), a multimodal associative forebrain structure and a presumed analogue of mammalian prefrontal cortex, represent information useful for goal-directed behavior. We subjected pigeons to a go-nogo task, in which responding to one visual stimulus (S+) was partially reinforced, responding to another stimulus (S–) was punished, and responding to test stimuli from the same physical dimension (spatial frequency) was inconsequential. The birds responded most intensely to S+, and their response rates decreased monotonically as stimuli became progressively dissimilar to S+; thereby, response rates provided a behavioral index of reward expectancy. We found that many NCL neurons' responses were modulated in the stimulus discrimination phase, the outcome phase, or both. A substantial fraction of neurons increased firing for cues predicting non-reward or decreased firing for cues predicting reward. Interestingly, the same neurons also responded when reward was expected but not delivered, and could thus provide a negative reward prediction error or, alternatively, signal negative value. In addition, many cells showed motor-related response modulation. In summary, NCL neurons represent information about the reward value of specific stimuli, instrumental actions as well as action outcomes, and therefore provide signals useful for adaptive behavior in dynamically changing environments."
https://openalex.org/W1998106052,"The ability to recognize and distinguish between visual stimuli is fundamental for everyday survival of many species. While diverse aspects of cognition, including complex visual discrimination tasks were previously successfully assessed in fish, it remains unknown if fish can learn a matching-to-sample concept using geometrical shapes and discriminate between images and their mirror-image counterparts. For this purpose a total of nine Malawi cichlids (Pseudotropheus sp.) were trained in two matching-to-sample (MTS) and three two-choice discrimination tasks using geometrical, two-dimensional visual stimuli. Two out of the three discrimination experiments focused on the ability to discriminate between images and their mirror-images, the last was a general discrimination test. All fish showed quick associative learning but were unable to perform successfully in a simultaneous MTS procedure within a period of 40 sessions. Three out of eight fish learned to distinguish between an image and its mirror-image when reflected vertically; however none of the fish mastered the task when the stimulus was reflected horizontally. These results suggest a better discrimination ability of vertical compared to horizontal mirror-images, an observation that is widespread in literature on mirror-image discrimination in animals. All fish performed well in the general visual discrimination task, thereby supporting previous results obtained for this species."
https://openalex.org/W2015294116,"CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) are essential for the maintenance of the immune system's equilibrium, by dampening the activation of potential auto-reactive T cells and avoiding excessive immune activation. To correctly perform their function, Tregs must be maintained at the right proportion with respect to effector T cells. Since this equilibrium is frequently disrupted in individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), we hypothesize that its deregulation could hamper immune reconstitution in patients with poor CD4+ T cell recovery under highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). We analysed Tregs percentages amongst CD4+ T cells in 53 HIV-infected patients under HAART, with suppression of viral replication and distinct levels of immune reconstitution. As controls, 51 healthy individuals were also analysed. We observed that amongst the patients with Nadir values (the lowest CD4+ T cell counts achieved) <200 cells/µL, the individuals with high Tregs percentages (≥10% of total CD4+ T cells) had the worse CD4+ T cell reconstitution. In accordance, the well-described direct correlation between the Nadir value and CD4+ T cell reconstitution is clearly more evident in individuals with high Tregs proportions. Furthermore, we observed a strong negative correlation between Tregs percentages and CD4+ T cell recovery among immunological non-responder HIV+ individuals. All together, this work shows that high Tregs frequency is an important factor associated with sub-optimal CD4+ T cell recovery. This is particularly relevant for immunological non-responders with low Nadir values. Our results suggest that the Tregs proportion might be of clinical relevance to define cut-offs for HAART initiation."
https://openalex.org/W2061629872,"Objective To explore trends in access to dental care among middle-income Canadians. Methods A secondary data analysis of six Canadian surveys that collected information on dental insurance coverage, cost-barriers to dental care, and out-of-pocket expenditures for dental care was conducted for select years from 1978 to 2009. Descriptive analyses were used to outline and compare trends among middle-income Canadians with other levels of income as well as national averages. Results By 2009, middle-income Canadians had the lowest levels of dental insurance coverage (48.7%) compared to all other income groups. They reported the greatest increase in cost-barriers to dental care, from 12.6% in 1996 to 34.1% by 2009. Middle-income Canadians had the largest rise in out-of-pocket expenditures for dental care since 1978. Conclusions This study suggests that affordability issues in accessing dental care are no longer just a problem for the lowest income groups in Canada, but are now impacting middle-income earners as a consequence of their lack of, or decreased access to, comprehensive dental insurance."
https://openalex.org/W1965205425,"Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) plays a role in prostate cancer and agents that suppress its activation may inhibit development or progression of this malignancy. Alpha (α)-tomatine is the major saponin present in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) and we have previously reported that it suppresses tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-induced nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) in androgen-independent prostate cancer PC-3 cells and also potently induces apoptosis of these cells. However, the precise mechanism by which α-tomatine suppresses NF-κB nuclear translocation is yet to be elucidated and the anti-tumor activity of this agent in vivo has not been examined.In the present study we show that suppression of NF-κB activation by α-tomatine occurs through inhibition of I kappa B alpha (IκBα) kinase activity, leading to sequential suppression of IκBα phosphorylation, IκBα degradation, NF-κB/p65 phosphorylation, and NF-κB p50/p65 nuclear translocation. Consistent with its ability to induce apoptosis, α-tomatine reduced TNF-α induced activation of the pro-survival mediator Akt and its inhibition of NF-κB activation was accompanied by significant reduction in the expression of NF-κB-dependent anti-apoptotic (c-IAP1, c-IAP2, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, XIAP and survivin) proteins. We also evaluated the antitumor activity of α-tomatine against PC-3 cell tumors grown subcutaneously and orthotopically in mice. Our data indicate that intraperitoneal administration of α-tomatine significantly attenuates the growth of PC-3 cell tumors grown at both sites. Analysis of tumor material indicates that the tumor suppressing effects of α-tomatine were accompanied by increased apoptosis and lower proliferation of tumor cells as well as reduced nuclear translocation of the p50 and p65 components of NF-κB.Our study provides first evidence for in vivo antitumor efficacy of α-tomatine against the human androgen-independent prostate cancer. The potential usefulness of α-tomatine in prostate cancer prevention and therapy requires further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W1973104905,"P2X purinoceptor 7 (P2X7R), an ATP-gated ion channel, plays an important role during the innate immune response in mammals. However, relatively little is known about the role of P2X7R in the fish immune system. Here, we cloned a cDNA sequence encoding ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis) P2X7R (aP2X7R). The predicted protein was composed of 574 amino acid residues with a P2X family signature, two transmembrane domains, and a long C-terminal. aP2X7R transcripts were mainly distributed in ayu immune tissues and significantly increased in all tested tissues and in macrophages after Listonella anguillarum infection. The aP2X7R protein was upregulated significantly in macrophages upon bacterial challenge. An antibody against the ectodomain of aP2X7R (aEPAb) and an antagonist (oATP) were used to block aP2X7R. aP2X7R siRNA was also used to knockdown the receptor expression in ayu macrophages. Cell death induced by ATP was significantly inhibited in ayu macrophages after aEPAb, oATP, or siRNA treatment. Moreover, aP2X7R ablation also resulted in suppression of phagocytic activity and ATP-induced bacterial killing in ayu macrophages. Our results indicated that aP2X7R was upregulated after infection and mediated cell death, phagocytosis, and bacterial killing of ayu macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2021225492,"Adequate blood flow through placental chorionic plate resistance arteries (CPAs) is necessary for oxygen and nutrient transfer to the fetus and a successful pregnancy. In non-placental vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs), K(+) channels regulate contraction, vascular tone and blood flow. Previous studies showed that K(+) channel modulators alter CPA tone, but did not distinguish between effects on K(+) channels in endothelial cells and SMCs. In this study, we developed a preparation of freshly isolated CPASMCs of normal pregnancy and investigated K(+) channel expression and function. CPASMCs were isolated from normal human term placentas using enzymatic digestion. Purity and phenotype was confirmed with immunocytochemistry. Whole-cell patch clamp was used to assess K(+) channel currents, and mRNA and protein expression was determined in intact CPAs and isolated SMCs with RT-PCR and immunostaining. Isolated SMCs expressed α-actin but not CD31, a marker of endothelial cells. CPASMCs and intact CPAs expressed h-caldesmon and non-muscle myosin heavy chain-2; phenotypic markers of contractile and synthetic SMCs respectively. Whole-cell currents were inhibited by 4-AP, TEA, charybdotoxin and iberiotoxin implicating functional K(v) and BK(Ca) channels. 1-EBIO enhanced whole cell currents which were abolished by TRAM-34 and reduced by apamin indicating activation of IK(Ca) and SK(Ca) respectively. BK(Ca), IK(Ca) and SK(Ca)3 mRNA and/or protein were expressed in CPASMCs and intact CPAs. This study provides the first direct evidence for functional K(v), BK(Ca,) IK(Ca) and SK(Ca) channels in CPASMCs. These cells display a mixed phenotype implicating a dual role for CPASMCs in controlling both fetoplacental vascular resistance and vasculogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2035182892,"This study investigated how both sex and individual differences in a mental rotation test (MRT) influence performance on working memory (WM). To identify the neural substrate supporting these differences, brain electrical activity was measured using the event-related potential technique. No significant sex differences were observed in a test of verbal WM, however males were significantly faster than females to respond to probe stimuli in a test of spatial WM. This difference was no longer significant after controlling for differences in MRT score, suggesting that rotational ability mediates performance in the spatial memory task for both sexes. A posterior P300 was observed in both tasks as participants encoded information into memory, however the amplitude of the P300 correlated with RT in the spatial task but not in the verbal task. Individual differences in the MRT also correlated with RT and with the amplitude of the P300, but again only in the spatial task. After splitting the analysis by sex, partial correlations controlling for MRT revealed that for males, individual differences in rotational ability completely mediated the correlation between the P300 and RT in the spatial task. This mediating effect was not observed for the female participants. The results therefore suggest a relatively stronger association in males between innate mental rotational ability, spatial memory performance, and brain electrophysiological processes supporting spatial memory."
https://openalex.org/W2055519049,"To aid preclinical development of novel therapeutics for myeloma, an in vivo model which recapitulates the human condition is required. An important feature of such a model is the interaction of myeloma cells with the bone marrow microenvironment, as this interaction modulates tumour activity and protects against drug-induced apoptosis. Therefore NOD/SCIDγcnull mice were injected intra-tibially with luciferase-tagged myeloma cells. Disease progression was monitored by weekly bioluminescent imaging (BLI) and measurement of paraprotein levels. Results were compared with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histology. Assessment of model suitability for preclinical drug testing was investigated using bortezomib, melphalan and two novel agents. Cells engrafted at week 3, with a significant increase in BLI radiance occurring between weeks 5 and 7. This was accompanied by an increase in paraprotein secretion, MRI-derived tumour volume and CD138 positive cells within the bone marrow. Treatment with known anti-myeloma agents or novel agents significantly attenuated the increase in all disease markers. In addition, intra-tibial implantation of primary patient plasma cells resulted in development of myeloma within bone marrow. In conclusion, using both myeloma cell lines and primary patient cells, we have developed a model which recapitulates human myeloma by ensuring the key interaction of tumour cells with the microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2056033592,"Adenoviruses (Ads) with deletion of E1b55K preferentially replicate in cancer cells and have been used in cancer therapies. We have previously shown that Ad E1B55K protein is involved in induction of cyclin E for Ad replication, but this E1B55K function is not required in cancer cells in which deregulation of cyclin E is frequently observed. In this study, we investigated the interaction of cyclin E and CDK2 in Ad-infected cells. Ad infection significantly increased the large form of cyclin E (cyclin EL), promoted cyclin E/CDK2 complex formation and increased CDK2 phosphorylation at the T160 site. Activated CDK2 caused pRb phosphorylation at the S612 site. Repression of CDK2 activity with the chemical inhibitor roscovitine or with specific small interfering RNAs significantly decreased pRb phosphorylation, with concomitant repression of viral replication. Our results suggest that Ad-induced cyclin E activates CDK2 that targets the transcriptional repressor pRb to generate a cellular environment for viral productive replication. This study reveals a new molecular basis for oncolytic replication of E1b-deleted Ads and will aid in the development of new strategies for Ad oncolytic virotherapies."
https://openalex.org/W2015455892,"Premotor cortical regions (PMC) play an important role in the orchestration of motor function, yet their role in compensatory mechanisms in a disturbed motor system is largely unclear. Previous studies are consistent in describing pronounced anatomical and functional connectivity between the PMC and the primary motor cortex (M1). Lesion studies consistently show compensatory adaptive changes in PMC neural activity following an M1 lesion. Non-invasive brain modification of PMC neural activity has shown compensatory neurophysiological aftereffects in M1. These studies have contributed to our understanding of how M1 responds to changes in PMC neural activity. Yet, the way in which the PMC responds to artificial inhibition of M1 neural activity is unclear. Here we investigate the neurophysiological consequences in the PMC and the behavioral consequences for motor performance of stimulation mediated M1 inhibition by cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).The primary goal was to determine how electrophysiological measures of PMC excitability change in order to compensate for inhibited M1 neural excitability and attenuated motor performance.Cathodal inhibition of M1 excitability leads to a compensatory increase of ipsilateral PMC excitability.We enrolled 16 healthy participants in this randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, crossover design study. All participants underwent navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) to identify PMC and M1 corticospinal projections as well as to evaluate electrophysiological measures of cortical, intracortical and interhemispheric excitability. Cortical M1 excitability was inhibited using cathodal tDCS. Finger-tapping speeds were used to examine motor function.Cathodal tDCS successfully reduced M1 excitability and motor performance speed. PMC excitability was increased for longer and was the only significant predictor of motor performance.The PMC compensates for attenuated M1 excitability and contributes to motor performance maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W1983275010,"The manner in which the nervous system regulates animal behaviors in natural environments is a fundamental issue in biology. To address this question, C. elegans has been widely used as a model animal for the analysis of various animal behaviors. Previous behavioral assays have been limited to two-dimensional (2-D) environments, confining the worm motion to a planar substrate that does not reflect three-dimensional (3-D) natural environments such as rotting fruits or soil. Here, we develop a 3-D worm tracker (3DWT) for freely moving C. elegans in 3-D environments, based on a stereoscopic configuration. The 3DWT provides us with a quantitative trajectory, including the position and movement direction of the worm in 3-D. The 3DWT is also capable of recording and visualizing postures of the moving worm in 3-D, which are more complex than those in 2-D. Our 3DWT affords new opportunities for understanding the nervous system function that regulates animal behaviors in natural 3-D environments."
https://openalex.org/W2076362991,"It is well known that the planum temporale (PT) area in the posterior temporal lobe carries out spectro-temporal analysis of auditory stimuli, which is crucial for speech, for example. There are suggestions that the PT is also involved in auditory attention, specifically in the discrimination and selection of stimuli from the left and right ear. However, direct evidence is missing so far. To examine the role of the PT in auditory attention we asked fourteen participants to complete the Bergen Dichotic Listening Test. In this test two different consonant-vowel syllables (e.g., “ba” and “da”) are presented simultaneously, one to each ear, and participants are asked to verbally report the syllable they heard best or most clearly. Thus attentional selection of a syllable is stimulus-driven. Each participant completed the test three times: after their left and right PT (located with anatomical brain scans) had been stimulated with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), which transiently interferes with normal brain functioning in the stimulated sites, and after sham stimulation, where participants were led to believe they had been stimulated but no rTMS was applied (control). After sham stimulation the typical right ear advantage emerged, that is, participants reported relatively more right than left ear syllables, reflecting a left-hemispheric dominance for language. rTMS over the right but not left PT significantly reduced the right ear advantage. This was the result of participants reporting more left and fewer right ear syllables after right PT stimulation, suggesting there was a leftward shift in stimulus selection. Taken together, our findings point to a new function of the PT in addition to auditory perception: particularly the right PT is involved in stimulus selection and (stimulus-driven), auditory attention."
https://openalex.org/W2007523413,"Background Doxorubicin (DOX) is associated with premature cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction. This study was performed to determine if the weekly administration of DOX influenced coronary arteriolar medial and/or adventitial wall thickening. Methods Thirty-two male Sprague-Dawley rats aged 25.1± 2.4 weeks were randomly divided into three groups and received weekly intraperitoneal injections of normal saline (saline, n = 7), or low (1.5 mg/kg to 1.75 mg/kg, n = 14) or high (2.5 mg/kg, n = 11) doses of DOX. The animals were treated for 2–12 weeks, and euthanized at pre-specified intervals (2, 4, 7, or 10+ weeks) to obtain histopathologic assessments of coronary arteriolar lumen diameter, medial wall thickness, adventitial wall thickness, and total wall thickness (medial thickness + adventitial thickness). Results Lumen diameter was similar across all groups (saline: 315±34 µm, low DOX: 286±24 µm, high DOX: 242±27 µm; p = 0.22). In comparison to animals receiving weekly saline, animals receiving weekly injections of 2.5 mg/kg of DOX experienced an increase in medial (23±2µm vs. 13±3µm; p = 0.005), and total wall thickness (51±4µm vs. 36±5µm; p = 0.022), respectively. These increases, as well as adventitial thickening became more prominent after normalizing for lumen diameter (p<0.05 to p<0.001) and after adjusting for age, weight, and total cumulative DOX dose (p = 0.02 to p = 0.01). Animals receiving low dose DOX trended toward increases in adventitial and total wall thickness after normalization to lumen diameter and accounting for age, weight, and total cumulative DOX dose (p = 0.06 and 0.09, respectively). Conclusion In conclusion, these data demonstrate that weekly treatment of rats with higher doses of DOX increases coronary arteriolar medial, adventitial, and total wall thickness. Future studies are warranted to determine if DOX related coronary arteriolar effects are reversible or preventable, exacerbate the known cardiomyopathic effects of DOX, influence altered resting or stress-induced myocardial perfusion, or contribute to the occurrence of myocardial infarction."
https://openalex.org/W2058272494,"Based on evolutionary theory, Trivers & Willard (TW) predicted the existence of mechanisms that lead parents with high levels of resources to bias offspring sex composition to favor sons and parents with low levels of resources to favor daughters. This hypothesis has been tested in samples of wealthy individuals but with mixed results. Here, I argue that both sample selection due to a high number of missing cases and a lacking specification of the timing of wealth accumulation contribute to this equivocal pattern. This study improves on both issues: First, analyses are based on a data set of U.S. billionaires with near-complete information on the sex of offspring. Second, subgroups of billionaires are distinguished according to the timing when they acquired their wealth. Informed by recent insights on the timing of a potential TW effect in animal studies, I state two hypotheses. First, billionaires have a higher share of male offspring than the general population. Second, this effect is larger for heirs and heiresses who are wealthy at the time of conception of all of their children than for self-made billionaires who acquired their wealth during their adult lives, that is, after some or all of their children have already been conceived. Results do not support the first hypothesis for all subgroups of billionaires. But for males, results are weakly consistent with the second hypothesis: Heirs but not self-made billionaires have a higher share of male offspring than the U.S. population. Heiresses, on the other hand, have a much lower share of male offspring than the U.S. average. This hints to a possible interplay of at least two mechanisms affecting sex composition. Implications for future research that would allow disentangling the distinct mechanisms are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2025140882,"Cardiomyocytes express neurotrophin receptor TrkA that promotes survival following nerve growth factor (NGF) ligation. Whether TrkA also resides in cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) and underlies cardioprotection is unknown.To test whether CFs express TrkA that conveys paracrine signals to neighbor cardiomyocytes using, as probe, the Chagas disease parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which expresses a TrkA-binding neurotrophin mimetic, named PDNF. T. cruzi targets the heart, causing chronic debilitating cardiomyopathy in ∼30% patients.Basal levels of TrkA and TrkC in primary CFs are comparable to those in cardiomyocytes. However, in the myocardium, TrkA expression is significantly lower in fibroblasts than myocytes, and vice versa for TrkC. Yet T. cruzi recognition of TrkA on fibroblasts, preferentially over cardiomyocytes, triggers a sharp and sustained increase in NGF, including in the heart of infected mice or of mice administered PDNF intravenously, as early as 3-h post-administration. Further, NGF-containing T. cruzi- or PDNF-induced fibroblast-conditioned medium averts cardiomyocyte damage by H(2)O(2), in agreement with the previously recognized cardioprotective role of NGF.TrkA residing in CFs induces an exuberant NGF production in response to T. cruzi infection, enabling, in a paracrine fashion, myocytes to resist oxidative stress, a leading Chagas cardiomyopathy trigger. Thus, PDNF-TrkA interaction on CFs may be a mechanism orchestrated by T. cruzi to protect its heart habitat, in concert with the long-term (decades) asymptomatic heart parasitism that characterizes Chagas disease. Moreover, as a potent booster of cardioprotective NGF in vivo, PDNF may offer a novel therapeutic opportunity against cardiomyopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2093909570,"Background In low-income countries, viral load (VL) monitoring of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is rarely available in the public sector for HIV-infected adults or children. Using clinical failure alone to identify first-line ART failure and trigger regimen switch may result in unnecessary use of costly second-line therapy. Our objective was to identify CD4 threshold values to confirm clinically-determined ART failure when VL is unavailable. Methods 3316 HIV-infected Ugandan/Zimbabwean adults were randomised to first-line ART with Clinically-Driven (CDM, CD4s measured but blinded) or routine Laboratory and Clinical Monitoring (LCM, 12-weekly CD4s) in the DART trial. CD4 at switch and ART failure criteria (new/recurrent WHO 4, single/multiple WHO 3 event; LCM: CD4<100 cells/mm3) were reviewed in 361 LCM, 314 CDM participants who switched over median 5 years follow-up. Retrospective VLs were available in 368 (55%) participants. Results Overall, 265/361 (73%) LCM participants failed with CD4<100 cells/mm3; only 7 (2%) switched with CD4≥250 cells/mm3, four switches triggered by WHO events. Without CD4 monitoring, 207/314 (66%) CDM participants failed with WHO 4 events, and 77(25%)/30(10%) with single/multiple WHO 3 events. Failure/switching with single WHO 3 events was more likely with CD4≥250 cells/mm3 (28/77; 36%) (p = 0.0002). CD4 monitoring reduced switching with viral suppression: 23/187 (12%) LCM versus 49/181 (27%) CDM had VL<400 copies/ml at failure/switch (p<0.0001). Amongst CDM participants with CD4<250 cells/mm3 only 11/133 (8%) had VL<400copies/ml, compared with 38/48 (79%) with CD4≥250 cells/mm3 (p<0.0001). Conclusion Multiple, but not single, WHO 3 events predicted first-line ART failure. A CD4 threshold ‘tiebreaker’ of ≥250 cells/mm3 for clinically-monitored patients failing first-line could identify ∼80% with VL<400 copies/ml, who are unlikely to benefit from second-line. Targeting CD4s to single WHO stage 3 ‘clinical failures’ would particularly avoid premature, costly switch to second-line ART."
https://openalex.org/W2120164489,"Lead exposure in waterfowl was studied using noninvasive fecal sampling in the Guadalquivir Marshes in Spain, an area affected by the 1998 Aznalcóllar mine disaster. Feces of greylag geese (Anser anser, n = 191) and purple gallinule (Porphyrio porphyrio, n = 91) were collected from three different impacted sites (Entremuros, Caracoles and Cerro de los Ánsares) during the winters of 2004 to 2008. Lead and aluminium (an indicator of sediment ingestion) and Pb isotope signatures (to discriminate between sources of Pb exposure) were analyzed in freeze-dried, acid digested samples. The concentrations of fecal porphyrins and biliverdin were determined as noninvasive biomarkers to study Pb exposure effects. Results showed a decrease in Pb exposure over time in wintering greylag geese. In contrast, for purple gallinule resident in the Entremuros a clear trend was not evident. For both species, sediment ingestion appeared to be the main source of exposure to Pb. In the Entremuros, some samples from purple gallinule were detected with higher Pb levels than expected for simple soil ingestion, and these had Pb isotopic profiles compatible with mining sludge or Pb shot. Whilst fecal Pb isotopic profiles were effective in differentiating between samples from sites with different levels and sources of pollution, the combined use of element ratios (such as Pb/Al) and other non-traditional stable isotope signatures may also prove worthwhile. Overall, the fecal Pb levels detected were below those described in feces for waterfowl from other uncontaminated areas(<10 µg/g d.w.). Despite this, for both species fecal Pb levels were positively correlated with porphyrin excretion, and for purple gallinule, with the coproporphyrin III/I ratio, suggesting some subtle effects on heme synthesis in birds. Ten years after the mine spill, Pb contamination in birds by this pollution source was still detectable and subtlethal effects may persist."
https://openalex.org/W2128397313,"Cyclic peptides are increasingly being shown as powerful inhibitors of fibril formation, and have the potential to be therapeutic agents for combating many debilitating amyloid-related diseases. One such example is a cyclic peptide derivative from the human apolipoprotein C-II, which has the ability to inhibit fibril formation by the fibrillogenic peptide apoC-II(60–70). Using classical molecular dynamics and electronic structure calculations, we were able to provide insight into the interaction between the amyloidogenic peptide apoC-II(60–70) and its cyclic derivative, cyc(60–70). Our results showed that cyc(60–70) induced increased flexibility in apoC-II(60–70), suggesting that one mechanism by which cyc(60–70) inhibits fibrillisation is by destabilising apoC-II(60–70) structure, rendering it incapable of adopting fibril favouring conformations. In contrast, cyc(60–70) shows less flexibility upon binding to apoC-II(60–70), which is predominantly mediated by hydrophobic interactions between the aromatic rings of the peptides. This effectively creates a cap around the fibril-forming region of apoC-II(60–70) and generates an outer hydrophilic shell that discourages further apoC-II(60–70) peptide self-association. We showed that apoC-II(60–70) exhibited stronger binding affinity for the hydrophobic face of cyc(60–70) and weakest binding affinity for the hydrophilic side. This suggests that cyc(60–70) can be an effective fibril inhibitor due to its amphipathic character, like that of the ""Janus""-type particles. This property can be exploited in the design of specific inhibitors of amyloid fibril formation."
https://openalex.org/W2028228794,"Serotyping is the long-standing gold standard method to determine E. coli H antigens; however, this method requires a panel of H-antigen specific antibodies and often culture-based induction of the H-antigen flagellar motility. In this study, a rapid and accurate method to isolate and identify the Escherichia coli (E. coli) H flagellar antigen was developed using membrane filtration and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Flagella were isolated from pure culture, digested with trypsin, and then subjected to LC-MS/MS using one of two systems (Agilent-nano-LC-QSTAR XL or Proxeon-nano-LC-LTQ-Orbitrap XL). The resulting peptide sequence data were searched against a custom E. coli flagella/H antigen database. This approach was evaluated using flagella isolated from reference E. coli strains representing all 53 known H antigen types and 41 clinical E. coli strains. The resulting LC-MS/MS classifications of H antigen types (MS-H) were concordant with the known H serogroup for all 53 reference types, and of 41 clinical isolates tested, 38 (92.7%) were concordant with the known H serogroup. MS-H clearly also identified two clinical isolates (4.9%) that were untypeable by serotyping. Notably, successful detection and classification of flagellar antigens with MS-H did not generally require induction of motility, establishing this proteomic approach as more rapid and cost-effective than traditional methods, while providing equitable specificity for typing E. coli H antigens."
https://openalex.org/W2043198550,"The Dementia Risk Assessment (DRA) is an online tool consisting of questions about known risk factors for dementia, a novel verbal memory test, and an informant report of cognitive decline. Its primary goal is to educate the public about dementia risk factors and encourage clinical evaluation where appropriate. In Study 1, more than 3,000 anonymous persons over age 50 completed the DRA about themselves; 1,000 people also completed proxy reports about another person. Advanced age, lower education, male sex, complaints of severe memory impairment, and histories of cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson's disease, and brain tumor all contributed significantly to poor memory performance. A high correlation was obtained between proxy-reported decline and actual memory test performance. In Study 2, 52 persons seeking first-time evaluation at dementia clinics completed the DRA prior to their visits. Their responses (and those of their proxy informants) were compared to the results of independent evaluation by geriatric neuropsychiatrists. The 30 patients found to meet criteria for probable Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, or frontotemporal dementia differed on the DRA from the 22 patients without dementia (most other neuropsychiatric conditions). Scoring below criterion on the DRA's memory test had moderately high predictive validity for clinically diagnosed dementia. Although additional studies of larger clinical samples are needed, the DRA holds promise for wide-scale screening for dementia risk."
https://openalex.org/W2018406368,"The transcription process is crucial to life and the enzyme RNA polymerase (RNAP) is the major component of the transcription machinery. The development of single-molecule techniques, such as magnetic and optical tweezers, atomic-force microscopy and single-molecule fluorescence, increased our understanding of the transcription process and complements traditional biochemical studies. Based on these studies, theoretical models have been proposed to explain and predict the kinetics of the RNAP during the polymerization, highlighting the results achieved by models based on the thermodynamic stability of the transcription elongation complex. However, experiments showed that if more than one RNAP initiates from the same promoter, the transcription behavior slightly changes and new phenomenona are observed. We proposed and implemented a theoretical model that considers collisions between RNAPs and predicts their cooperative behavior during multi-round transcription generalizing the Bai et al. stochastic sequence-dependent model. In our approach, collisions between elongating enzymes modify their transcription rate values. We performed the simulations in Mathematica® and compared the results of the single and the multiple-molecule transcription with experimental results and other theoretical models. Our multi-round approach can recover several expected behaviors, showing that the transcription process for the studied sequences can be accelerated up to 48% when collisions are allowed: the dwell times on pause sites are reduced as well as the distance that the RNAPs backtracked from backtracking sites."
https://openalex.org/W1976501004,"The aim of this study is to evaluate the serum activity of metalloproteinases (MMPs) -2 and -9 as predictors of pressure ulcer (PU), gait status and mortality 6 months after hip fracture.Eighty-seven patients over the age of 65 admitted to the orthopedic unit from January to December 2010 with hip fracture were prospectively evaluated. Upon admission, patient demographic information, including age, gender and concomitant diseases, was recorded. Blood samples were taken for analysis of MMP -2 and -9 activity by gel zymography and for biochemical examination within the first 72 hours of the patient's admission, after clinical stabilization. The fracture pattern (neck, trochanteric or subtrochanteric), time from admission to surgery, surgery duration and length of hospital stay were also recorded.Two patients were excluded due to the presence of pathological fractures (related to cancer), and three patients were excluded due to the presence of PU before admission. Eighty-two patients, with a mean age of 80.4 ± 7.3 years, were included in the analysis. Among these patients, 75.6% were female, 59.8% had PU, and 13.4% died 6 months after hip fracture. All patients underwent hip fracture repair. In a univariate analysis, there were no differences in serum MMP activity between hip fracture patients with or without PU. In addition, the multiple logistic regression analysis models, which were adjusted by age, gender, length of hospital stay and C-reactive protein, showed that the pro-MMP-9 complexed with neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin form (130 kDa) was associated with gait status recovery 6 months after hip fracture.In conclusion, serum pro-MMP-9 is a predictor of gait status recovery 6 months after hip fracture."
