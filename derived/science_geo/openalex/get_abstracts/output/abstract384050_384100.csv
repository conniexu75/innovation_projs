Gata4/Mef2c/Tbx5 directly reprogram fibroblasts into cardiomyocyte-like cells Induced cardiomyocytes (iCMs) have spontaneous contraction and action potentials iCMs resemble cardiomyocytes in their global gene expression and epigenetic state Transplanted cardiac fibroblasts can be reprogrammed into iCMs in vivo Heart disease is a leading cause of adult and childhood mortality. The underlying pathology is typically loss of cardiomyocytes that leads to heart failure or improper development of cardiomyocytes during embryogenesis that leads to congenital heart malformations. Because postnatal cardiomyocytes have little or no regenerative capacity, current therapeutic approaches are limited. Embryonic stem cells possess clear cardiogenic potential, but efficiency of cardiac differentiation, risk of tumor formation, and issues of cellular rejection must be overcome (Ivey and Srivastava, 2006Ivey K.N.

The ability to reprogram fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with four defined factors might address some of these issues by providing an alternative source of embryonic-like stem cells (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006Takahashi K.

However, generating sufficient iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes that are pure and mature and that can be delivered safely remains challenging (Zhang et al., 2009Zhang J. Wilson G.F. Soerens A.G.

In fact, cardiac fibroblasts comprise over 50% of all the cells in the heart (Baudino et al., 2006Baudino T.A. Carver W. Giles W. Borg T.K. Cardiac fibroblasts: friend or foe?.Am. J. Physiol.

Cardiac fibroblasts are fully differentiated somatic cells that provide support structure, secrete signals, and contribute to scar formation upon cardiac damage (Ieda et al., 2009Ieda M. Tsuchihashi T. Ivey K.N. Ross R.S. Hong T.T. Shaw R.M. Srivastava D. Cardiac fibroblasts regulate myocardial proliferation through beta1 integrin signaling.Dev. Cell. 2009; 16: 233-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts arise from an extracardiac source of cells known as the proepicardium, and do not normally have cardiogenic potential (Snider et al., 2009Snider P. Standley K.N. Wang J. Azhar M. Doetschman T. Conway S.J. Origin of cardiac fibroblasts and the role of periostin.Circ. Res. 2009; 105: 934-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The large population of endogenous cardiac fibroblasts is a potential source of cardiomyocytes for regenerative therapy if it were possible to directly reprogram the resident fibroblasts into beating cardiomyocytes. Unfortunately, although embryonic mesoderm can be induced to differentiate into cardiomyocytes (Takeuchi and Bruneau, 2009Takeuchi J.K. Bruneau B.G. Directed transdifferentiation of mouse mesoderm to heart tissue by defined factors.Nature. 2009; 459: 708-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), efforts to accomplish this in somatic cells have thus far been unsuccessful, and to our knowledge, no “master regulator” of cardiac differentiation, like MyoD for skeletal muscle (Davis et al., 1987Davis R.L. Weintraub H. Lassar A.B. Expression of a single transfected cDNA converts fibroblasts to myoblasts.Cell. 1987; 51: 987-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2343) Google Scholar), has been identified to date. The generation of iPSCs suggests that a specific combination of defined factors, rather than a single factor, could epigenetically alter the global gene expression of a cell and allow greater plasticity of cell type than previously appreciated. Consistent with this, the bHLH transcription factor, Neurogenin 3, in combination with Pdx1 and Mafa, can efficiently reprogram pancreatic exocrine cells into functional β cells in vivo, although the exocrine cells were known to have some potential to become islet cells in vitro and share a common parent cell with islet cells (Baeyens et al., 2005Baeyens L.

Kanarek A. Rajagopal J. Melton D.A. In vivo reprogramming of adult pancreatic exocrine cells to beta-cells.Nature. 2008; 455: 627-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). A combination of three factors, Ascl1, Brn2, and Myt1l, converts dermal fibroblasts to functional neurons (Vierbuchen et al., 2010Vierbuchen T. Ostermeier A. Pang Z.P. Kokubu Y. Sudhof T.C. Wernig M. Direct conversion of fibroblasts to functional neurons by defined factors.Nature. 2010; 463: 1035-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (2075) Google Scholar), although the degree of global reprogramming of the neurons is unknown. In this study, we examined whether key developmental cardiac regulators could reprogram cardiac fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes. We found that out of a total of 14 factors, a specific combination of three transcription factors, Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5, was sufficient to generate functional beating cardiomyocytes directly from mouse postnatal cardiac or dermal fibroblasts and that the induced cardiomyocytes (iCMs) were globally reprogrammed to adopt a cardiomyocyte-like gene expression profile. We developed an assay system in which the induction of mature cardiomyocytes from fibroblasts could be analyzed quantitatively by reporter-based fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (Figure 1A ). To accomplish this, we generated αMHC promoter-driven EGFP-IRES-puromycin transgenic mice (αMHC-GFP), in which only mature cardiomyocytes expressed the green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Gulick et al., 1991Gulick J. Subramaniam A. Neumann J. Robbins J. Isolation and characterization of the mouse cardiac myosin heavy chain genes.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9180-9185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We confirmed that only cardiomyocytes, but not other cell types such as cardiac fibroblasts, expressed GFP in the transgenic mouse hearts and in primary cultured neonatal mouse cardiac cells (Figure S1 available online).Figure S1Characterization of αMHC-GFP+ Cells, Related to Figure 1, Figure 2Show full caption(A) αMHC-GFP and wild-type (WT) hearts at P1.

Fibroblast-like cells migrated from the explants after 2 days and were confluent after 1 week. The migrating cells did not express GFP, but expressed Thy1 and vimentin, markers of cardiac fibroblasts (Figure 1B and data not shown) (Hudon-David et al., 2007Hudon-David F. Bouzeghrane F.

Cardiac fibroblasts regulate myocardial proliferation through beta1 integrin signaling.Dev. Cell. 2009; 16: 233-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). To avoid contamination of cardiomyocytes, we filtered the cells by cell strainers to remove heart tissue fragments and isolated Thy1+/GFP− cells by FACS (Figure 1C). Using FACS, we confirmed that Thy1+/GFP− cells did not express cardiac troponin T (cTnT), a specific sarcomeric marker of differentiated mature cardiomyocytes (Figure S1) (Kattman et al., 2006Kattman S.J. Huber T.L. Keller G.M. Multipotent flk-1+ cardiovascular progenitor cells give rise to the cardiomyocyte, endothelial, and vascular smooth muscle lineages.Dev. Cell. 2006; 11: 723-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). With these procedures, we had no cardiomyocyte contamination in the fibroblast culture and could generate greater than twice the number of cardiac fibroblasts than by conventional fibroblast isolation techniques (Ieda et al., 2009Ieda M. Tsuchihashi T. Ivey K.N. Ross R.S. Hong T.T. Shaw R.M. Srivastava D. Cardiac fibroblasts regulate myocardial proliferation through beta1 integrin signaling.Dev. Cell. 2009; 16: 233-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). To select potential cardiac reprogramming factors, we used microarray analyses to identify transcription factors and epigenetic remodeling factors with greater expression in mouse cardiomyocytes than in cardiac fibroblasts at embryonic day 12.5 (Ieda et al., 2009Ieda M. Tsuchihashi T. Ivey K.N. Ross R.S. Hong T.T. Shaw R.M. Srivastava D. Cardiac fibroblasts regulate myocardial proliferation through beta1 integrin signaling.Dev. Cell. 2009; 16: 233-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Among them, we selected 13 factors that exhibited severe developmental cardiac defects and embryonic lethality when mutated (Figure S2). We also included the cardiovascular mesoderm-specific transcription factor Mesp1 because of its cardiac transdifferentiation effect in Xenopus (David et al., 2008David R. Brenner C. Stieber J. Schwarz F. Brunner S. Vollmer M. Mentele E. Muller-Hocker J. Kitajima S. Lickert H. et al.MesP1 drives vertebrate cardiovascular differentiation through Dkk-1-mediated blockade of Wnt-signalling.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We generated individual retroviruses to efficiently express each gene in cardiac fibroblasts (Figure S2). We transduced Thy1+/GFP− neonatal mouse cardiac fibroblasts with a mixture of retroviruses expressing all 14 factors or with DsRed retrovirus (negative control) (Hong et al., 2009Hong H. Takahashi K. Ichisaka T. Aoi T. Kanagawa O. Nakagawa M. Okita K. Yamanaka S. Suppression of induced pluripotent stem cell generation by the p53-p21 pathway.Nature. 2009; 460: 1132-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). We did not observe any GFP+ cells in cardiac fibroblasts 1 week after Ds-Red retrovirus infection or 1 week of culture without any viral infection. In contrast, transduction of all 14 factors into fibroblasts resulted in the generation of a small number of GFP+ cells (1.7%), indicating the successful activation of the cardiac-enriched αMHC gene in some cells (Figures 1D and 1E). To determine which of the 14 factors were critical for activating cardiac gene expression, we serially removed individual factors from the pool of 14. Pools lacking five factors (Baf60c, Hand2, Hopx, Hrt2, and Pitx2c) produced an increased number of GFP+ cells, suggesting they are dispensable in this setting (Figures 1D and 1E). Of note, removing Gata4 decreased the percentage of GFP+ cells to 0.5%, and removing Pitx2c increased it to 5%. Removal of the five factors listed above resulted in an increase in the percentage of GFP+ cells to 13% (Figure 1F). We conducted three further rounds of withdrawing single factors from nine-, six-, and five-factor pools, removing those that did not decrease efficiency upon withdrawal, and found that four factors (Gata4, Mef2c, Mesp1, and Tbx5) were sufficient for efficient GFP+ cell induction from cardiac fibroblasts (Figures 1F–1H). The combination of these four factors dramatically increased the number of fibroblasts activating the αMHC-GFP reporter to over 20% (Figure 1I). Next, we examined the expression of cTnT by FACS. We found that 20% of GFP+ cells expressed cTnT at high enough levels to detect by FACS 1 week after the four-factor transduction. Again removing individual factors from the four-factor pool in transduction, we found that Mesp1 was dispensable for cTnT expression (Figures 2A and 2B ). In contrast, we did not observe cTnT+ or GFP+ cells, when either Mef2c or Tbx5 was removed. Removal of Gata4 did not significantly affect the number of GFP+ cells, but cTnT expression was abolished, suggesting Gata4 was also required. Whereas the combination of two factors, Mef2c and Tbx5, induced GFP expression but not cTnT, no combination of two factors or single factor induced both GFP and cTnT expression in cardiac fibroblasts (Figure 2C). These data suggested that the combination of three factors, Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5, is sufficient to induce cardiac gene expression in fibroblasts. We found that 30% of GFP+ cells expressed cTnT 1 week after the three-factor transduction. Next, to confirm our screening results, we transduced cardiac fibroblasts with three factors (Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5, hereafter referred to as GMT) plus Nkx2-5, a critical factor for cardiogenesis but excluded by our initial screening. Surprisingly, adding Nkx2-5 to GMT dramatically inhibited the expression of GFP and cTnT in cardiac fibroblasts. We also transduced cardiac fibroblasts with the combination of Baf60c, Gata4, and Tbx5, which can transdifferentiate noncardiogenic mesoderm to cardiomyocytes in mouse embryos (Takeuchi and Bruneau, 2009Takeuchi J.K. Bruneau B.G. Directed transdifferentiation of mouse mesoderm to heart tissue by defined factors.Nature. 2009; 459: 708-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). We found that this combination did not efficiently induce cTnT or GFP expression above that of Tbx5 alone, confirming our screening results (Figure 2D). To determine if other cardiac genes were enriched in GFP+ cells, we sorted GFP+ cells and GFP− cells 7 days after transduction with GMT and compared gene expression of cardiomyocyte-specific genes, Myh6 (α-myosin heavy chain), Actc1 (cardiac α-actin), Actn2 (actinin α2), and Nppa (natriuretic peptide precursor type A) by quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR). We found that these cardiac genes were upregulated significantly more in GFP+ than in GFP− cells (Figure 2E). Next, we used immunocytochemistry to determine if cardiac proteins were expressed in GFP+ cells. Despite the detection of cTnT in only 30% of GFP+ cells, most GFP+ cells induced with the three factors expressed sarcomeric α-actinin (α-actinin) and had well-defined sarcomeric structures, similar to neonatal cardiomyocytes (Figure 2F; Figure S1). In addition to α-actinin, some GFP+ cells also expressed cTnT and ANF (atrial natriuretic factor), indicating GFP+ cells expressed several cardiomyocyte-specific markers (Figures 2G and 2H). We also confirmed that neither GFP+ nor GFP− cells expressed smooth muscle or endothelial cell markers (Figure S2), suggesting specificity of GMT effects. We next isolated neonatal cardiac fibroblasts by the conventional fibroblast isolation method in which hearts were digested with trypsin and plated on plastic dishes (Ieda et al., 2009Ieda M. Tsuchihashi T. Ivey K.N. Ross R.S. Hong T.T. Shaw R.M. Srivastava D. Cardiac fibroblasts regulate myocardial proliferation through beta1 integrin signaling.Dev. Cell. 2009; 16: 233-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). More than 85% of the cells expressed Thy1, and we isolated Thy1+/GFP− cells by FACS to exclude cardiomyocyte contamination (Figure 3A ). Fibroblasts transduced with GMT expressed GFP, cTnT, and actinin after 1 week at the same level as fibroblasts isolated from explant cultures (Figures 3B and 3C). Similar results were obtained on introduction of GMT into adult cardiac fibroblasts, with full formation of sarcomeric structures (Figure 3D; Figure S2). To determine if the induced cardiomyocyte-like cells (iCMs) were arising from a subpopulation of stem-like cells, we analyzed c-kit expression (Beltrami et al., 2003Beltrami A.P. Barlucchi L. Torella D. Baker M. Limana F. Chimenti S. Kasahara H. Rota M. Musso E. Urbanek K. et al.Adult cardiac stem cells are multipotent and support myocardial regeneration.Cell. 2003; 114: 763-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2867) Google Scholar) in the Thy1+/GFP− cells. Most c-kit+ cells coexpressed Thy1, whereas 15% of Thy1+ cells expressed c-kit, which is consistent with a previous report of cardiac explant-derived cells (Davis et al., 2009Davis D.R. Zhang Y. Smith R.R. Cheng K. Terrovitis J. Malliaras K. Li T.S. White A. Makkar R. Marban E. Validation of the cardiosphere method to culture cardiac progenitor cells from myocardial tissue.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e7195Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). We isolated GFP−/Thy1+/c-kit+ cells and GFP−/Thy1+/c-kit− cells by FACS and transduced each population of cells with GMT. We found 2–3-fold more cardiomyocyte induction in GFP−/Thy1+/c-kit− cells than in GFP−/Thy1+/c-kit+ cells (Figure S3). These results suggest that most of the iCMs originated from a c-kit-negative population. We then sought to more definitively exclude the possibility of rare cardiac progenitors giving rise to iCMs. We tested the potential of mouse tail-tip dermal fibroblasts to generate iCMs. We found that sorted Thy1+/GFP− tail-tip dermal fibroblasts transduced with GMT expressed GFP at the same level as GMT-transduced cardiac fibroblasts, although the percentage of cTnT+ cells was less than cardiac fibroblast-derived iCMs (Figures 3E–3G). Like cardiac fibroblasts, tail-tip fibroblast-derived GFP+ cells expressed α-actinin and had well-defined sarcomeric structures (Figure 3H; Figure S3), suggesting noncardiac fibroblasts can also be reprogrammed into cardiomyocytes by GMT induction. These results excluded the possibility that the iCMs arose from contamination of cardiomyocytes or cardiac progenitors before cardiac induction in the fibroblast population. We also determined whether the reprogramming of fibroblasts to differentiated cardiomyocytes was a direct event or if the fibroblasts first passed through a cardiac progenitor cell fate before further differentiation. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we used mice expressing Isl1–yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) obtained by crossing Isl1-Cre mice and R26R-EYFP mice (Srinivas et al., 2001Srinivas S. Watanabe T. Lin C.S. William C.M. Tanabe Y. Jessell T.M. Costantini F. Cre reporter strains produced by targeted insertion of EYFP and ECFP into the ROSA26 locus.BMC Dev. Biol. 2001; 1: 4Crossref PubMed Scopus (2135) Google Scholar) (Figure S3). Isl1 is an early cardiac progenitor marker that is transiently expressed before cardiac differentiation. If iCMs generated from fibroblasts passed through a cardiac progenitor state, they and their descendants would permanently express YFP (Laugwitz et al., 2005Laugwitz K.L. Moretti A. Lam J. Gruber P. Chen Y. Woodard S. Lin L.Z. Cai C.L. Lu M.M. Reth M. et al.Postnatal isl1+ cardioblasts enter fully differentiated cardiomyocyte lineages.Nature. 2005; 433: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). We isolated Isl1-YFP−/Thy1+cells from Isl1-YFP heart explants by FACS and transduced the cells with GMT. The resulting cTnT+ cells did not express YFP in significant numbers, suggesting that the iCMs were not first reprogrammed into Isl1+ cardiac progenitor cells (Figures 3I and 3J). Moreover, these results provided supportive evidence that the iCMs did not originate from a rare population of cardiac progenitor cells that might exist in neonatal hearts. Whereas Isl1 marks most early cardiac progenitors, a subpopulation of cardiac progenitors remains Isl1 negative. Mesp1 is the earliest pan-cardiovascular progenitor cell marker that is transiently expressed in nascent mesoderm before further cardiovascular differentiation (Figure S3) (Saga et al., 1999Saga Y. Miyagawa-Tomita S. Takagi A. Kitajima S. Miyazaki J. Inoue T. MesP1 is expressed in the heart precursor cells and required for the formation of a single heart tube.Development. 1999; 126: 3437-3447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore generated Mesp1-YFP mice by crossing Mesp1-Cre and R26R-EYFP mice to determine if iCMs were reprogrammed into early cardiac mesoderm before further differentiation. We isolated Mesp1-YFP−/Thy1+ tail-tip dermal fibroblasts by FACS and transduced the cells with GMT (Figures 3K and 3L). The resulting cTnT+ cells did not express YFP, suggesting that the iCMs were not converted into the cardiac mesoderm cell state for reprogramming, but rather they were directly reprogrammed into differentiated cardiomyocytes by the three factors (Figure 3L). We next analyzed the time course of cardiomyocyte induction from cardiac fibroblasts. GFP+ cells were detected 3 days after induction and gradually increased in number up to 20% at day 10 and were still present after 4 weeks (Figure 4A ). GFP+ cells were less proliferative than GFP− cells and, over time, decreased in percentage relative to the total number of cells. Importantly, the percentage of cTnT+ cells among the α-MHC-GFP+ iCMs and the intensity of cTnT expression increased significantly over time (Figures 4B and 4C). We sorted GFP+ cells at 1, 2, and 4 weeks after transduction with GMT and compared cardiac gene expression with cardiac fibroblasts and neonatal cardiomyocytes. The cardiomyocyte-specific genes, Actc1, Myh6, Ryr2 (ryanodine receptor 2), and Gja1 (connexin43), were significantly upregulated in a time-dependent manner in GFP+ cells, but were not detected in cardiac fibroblasts by qPCR (Figure 4D). Col1a2 (collagen 1a2), a marker of fibroblasts, was dramatically downregulated in GFP+ cells from 7-day culture to the same level as in cardiomyocytes. These data indicated that the three factors induced direct conversion of cardiac fibroblasts to cardiomyocytes rapidly and efficiently, but full maturation was a slow process that occurred over several weeks. Total gene expression of the three reprogramming factors was upregulated 6- to 8-fold in iCMs over neonatal cardiomyocytes. However, only endogenous expression of Gata4 was upregulated in iCMs to the same level as in neonatal cardiomyocytes, whereas endogenous Mef2c and Tbx5 expression was lower in iCMs than in cardiomyocytes, potentially reflecting negative autoregulatory loops (Figure S4).Figure S4Endogenous versus Exogenous Expression of Gata4/Mef2c/Tbx5, Related to Figure 4Show full captionmRNA expression levels of endogenous or retrovirally introduced Gata4, Mef2c or Tbx5 in 4 week iCMs compared to cardiac fibroblasts (CF) or neonatal cardiomyocytes (CM).

https://openalex.org/W2094215712,"Despite the essential role of the corticospinal tract (CST) in controlling voluntary movements, successful regeneration of large numbers of injured CST axons beyond a spinal cord lesion has never been achieved. We found that PTEN/mTOR are critical for controlling the regenerative capacity of mouse corticospinal neurons. After development, the regrowth potential of CST axons was lost and this was accompanied by a downregulation of mTOR activity in corticospinal neurons. Axonal injury further diminished neuronal mTOR activity in these neurons. Forced upregulation of mTOR activity in corticospinal neurons by conditional deletion of Pten, a negative regulator of mTOR, enhanced compensatory sprouting of uninjured CST axons and enabled successful regeneration of a cohort of injured CST axons past a spinal cord lesion. Furthermore, these regenerating CST axons possessed the ability to reform synapses in spinal segments distal to the injury.

The biophysical properties of mitochondrial calcium uptake have been studied in detail, but the underlying proteins remain elusive. Here we use an integrative strategy to predict human genes involved in mitochondrial calcium entry based on clues from comparative physiology, evolutionary genomics and organelle proteomics. RNA interference against 13 top candidates highlighted one gene, CBARA1, that we call hereafter mitochondrial calcium uptake 1 (MICU1). Silencing MICU1 does not disrupt mitochondrial respiration or membrane potential but abolishes mitochondrial calcium entry in intact and permeabilized cells, and attenuates the metabolic coupling between cytosolic calcium transients and activation of matrix dehydrogenases. MICU1 is associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane and has two canonical EF hands that are essential for its activity, indicating a role in calcium sensing. MICU1 represents the founding member of a set of proteins required for high-capacity mitochondrial calcium uptake. Its discovery may lead to the complete molecular characterization of mitochondrial calcium uptake pathways, and offers genetic strategies for understanding their contribution to normal physiology and disease. Uptake of calcium by mitochondria is crucial for many aspects of cellular function, and an imbalance can trigger cell death. Despite this, none of the proteins mediating mitochondrial uptake and buffering of calcium was known. Now one such protein — named 'mitochondrial calcium uptake 1' or MICU1 — has been identified. MICU1 is localized to the mitochondrion and is specifically required for calcium uptake. Genetic disruption of the MICU1 gene interrupts metabolic coupling between mitochondrial metabolism and calcium signalling. This work should facilitate the molecular characterization of mitochondrial calcium-uptake machinery and its role in normal physiology and diseases. The uptake of calcium by mitochondria has a central role in cell physiology, and an imbalance can trigger cell death. Now the first protein that is localized to the mitochondrion and is specifically required for calcium uptake has been identified. This protein, mitochondrial calcium uptake 1 (MICU1), represents the founding member of a set of proteins required for high-capacity calcium uptake. Its discovery should aid in the full molecular characterization of the mitochondrial calcium uptake pathways."

https://openalex.org/W2154990937,"RNA import into mammalian mitochondria is considered essential for replication, transcription, and translation of the mitochondrial genome but the pathway(s) and factors that control this import are poorly understood. Previously, we localized polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPASE), a 3' --> 5' exoribonuclease and poly-A polymerase, in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, a location lacking resident RNAs. Here, we show a new role for PNPASE in regulating the import of nuclear-encoded RNAs into the mitochondrial matrix. PNPASE reduction impaired mitochondrial RNA processing and polycistronic transcripts accumulated. Augmented import of RNase P, 5S rRNA, and MRP RNAs depended on PNPASE expression and PNPASE-imported RNA interactions were identified. PNPASE RNA processing and import activities were separable and a mitochondrial RNA targeting signal was isolated that enabled RNA import in a PNPASE-dependent manner. Combined, these data strongly support an unanticipated role for PNPASE in mediating the translocation of RNAs into mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2104599144,"Charlotte Niemeyer, Mignon Loh and colleagues report that germline mutations at CBL are associated with developmental abnormalities and predispose individuals to juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. CBL encodes a member of the Cbl family of proteins, which functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. We describe a dominant developmental disorder resulting from germline missense CBL mutations, which is characterized by impaired growth, developmental delay, cryptorchidism and a predisposition to juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). Some individuals experienced spontaneous regression of their JMML but developed vasculitis later in life. Importantly, JMML specimens from affected children show loss of the normal CBL allele through acquired isodisomy. Consistent with these genetic data, the common p.371Y>H altered Cbl protein induces cytokine-independent growth and constitutive phosphorylation of ERK, AKT and S6 only in hematopoietic cells in which normal Cbl expression is reduced by RNA interference. We conclude that germline CBL mutations have developmental, tumorigenic and functional consequences that resemble disorders that are caused by hyperactive Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling and include neurofibromatosis type 1, Noonan syndrome, Costello syndrome, cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome and Legius syndrome."

How global properties of a complex cytoskeletal system, for instance characteristic shape and size, emerge from the local biochemical properties of the constituting molecules is an open question. During cell division, the microtubule cytoskeleton forms the mitotic spindle to segregate the duplicated set of chromosomes (Walczak and Heald, 2008Walczak C.E. Heald R. Mechanisms of mitotic spindle assembly and function.Int. Rev. Cytol. 2008; 265: 111-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Spindles consist of two antiparallel arrays of microtubules that overlap in the spindle center, an organization that ensures spindle function. At anaphase onset, the central spindle reorganizes to form the midzone, a dense specialized array of antiparallel microtubules (Glotzer, 2009Glotzer M.

Several proteins essential for spindle elongation, faithful chromosome segregation, and proper cytokinesis relocalize selectively to the central spindle as a consequence of changes in their phosphorylation patterns in anaphase: PRC1 (protein required for cytokinesis 1), kinesin-4, the centralspindlin complex (containing a kinesin-6), the chromosome passenger complex, and several other molecular motors, nonmotor microtubule-bundling proteins, and regulators (Glotzer, 2009Glotzer M.

Ase1 in budding yeast has been proposed to be the core component of the spindle midzone. Genetic experiments have demonstrated that localization of all midzone proteins depends on Ase1, whose localization is independent of most other midzone proteins (Khmelinskii et al., 2007Khmelinskii A.

Importantly, it is unknown how the size of the midzone is determined. Whereas absence of PRC1 results in complete loss of midzone microtubule bundles in mammalian cells (Kurasawa et al., 2004Kurasawa Y. Earnshaw W.C. Mochizuki Y. Dohmae N. Todokoro K.

USA. 2005; 102: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a fragment of Xenopus kinesin-4 has been shown to decrease microtubule growth and shrinkage rates in vitro (Bringmann et al., 2004Bringmann H. Skiniotis G. Spilker A. Kandels-Lewis S. Vernos I. Surrey T. A kinesin-like motor inhibits microtubule dynamic instability.Science. 2004; 303: 1519-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), an activity different from other regulators of microtubule dynamics (Howard and Hyman, 2007Howard J. Hyman A.A. Microtubule polymerases and depolymerases.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Hence, kinesin-4 might contribute to midzone formation by regulating midzone microtubule dynamics. The minimal set of protein activities required for specific organizational features of the spindle midzone and the logic behind the combination of the required activities are, however, unknown. We have developed an in vitro reconstitution approach to investigate the combinatorial action of purified full-length Xenopus kinesin-4 (Xklp1) and Xenopus PRC1 on microtubule organization and dynamics. We show that Xklp1 is recruited to antiparallel microtubule overlaps by PRC1, which autonomously discriminates between parallel and antiparallel microtubules with high selectivity. Xklp1 ensures the maintenance of microtubule overlap size by selectively inhibiting the growth of overlapping microtubules in a manner that is dependent on overlap length. Our results demonstrate that only two proteins are necessary and sufficient for the selective formation and for adaptable length control of antiparallel microtubule overlaps in vitro, as required for the formation of the midzone in vivo. We developed a fluorescence microscopy assay to visualize dynamic microtubule encounters in vitro. We attached short, Alexa 568- and biotin-labeled, stabilized microtubule seeds under flow to glass slides, which were functionalized with a NeutrAvidin-biotin-polyethylene glycol layer. The majority of the seeds aligned, and microtubules growing from these seeds in the presence of Alexa 568–tubulin occasionally encountered each other in a plus end-to-plus end configuration (Figure 1A ). Multicolor time-lapse TIRF microscopy revealed that antiparallel microtubules connected in the presence of 5 nM purified PRC1–Alexa 647 as soon as their plus ends encountered, forming an antiparallel microtubule overlap (Figure 1B, Movie S1 available online). Interestingly, PRC1–Alexa 647 strongly accumulated in the growing antiparallel overlap region under conditions at which it did not localize significantly to individual microtubules or to parallel microtubule pairs (Figure 1C, Movie S1). This demonstrates that vertebrate PRC1 does not require an additional factor to selectively target antiparallel microtubule configurations. Autonomous binding to antiparallel microtubules, therefore, appears to be conserved between PRC1 orthologs from vertebrates and yeast (Janson et al., 2007Janson M.E. Loughlin R. Loiodice I. Fu C. Brunner D. Nedelec F.J. Tran P.T. Crosslinkers and motors organize dynamic microtubules to form stable bipolar arrays in fission yeast.Cell. 2007; 128: 357-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The length of antiparallel microtubule overlaps increased linearly with time after the microtubule encounter (Figure 1D, top) indicating constant average overlap growth velocity. Overlap length as measured from plus end to plus end of the two antiparallel microtubules increased approximately twice as fast (4.9 ± 0.9 μm/min, mean ± standard deviation [SD]) as the length of single microtubules that were not part of an antiparallel microtubule pair (2.3 ± 0.3 μm/min) (Figure 1D, bottom), demonstrating that the growth velocity of two microtubules of an antiparallel overlap is similar to that of individual microtubules and therefore not significantly affected by the strong accumulation of PRC1. To investigate the mechanism by which vertebrate PRC1 specifically recognizes antiparallel overlaps, we quantified its affinity and selectivity of binding to distinct microtubule configurations. We measured the average fluorescence intensity of PRC1–Alexa 647 in antiparallel overlaps as a function of the PRC1–Alexa 647 concentration (Figure 1E, Figure S1A ). PRC1 binding to antiparallel overlaps was strong and positively cooperative with a microscopic dissociation constant of 7.6 ± 0.4 nM (mean ± standard error of the mean [SEM]) and a Hill coefficient of 1.9 ± 0.1 (Figure 1E). Under standard imaging conditions, we did not detect any accumulation of PRC1 on individual microtubules or between parallel microtubules even at the highest PRC1 concentration used (31.5 nM) (Figure S1B). We estimate that PRC1 binds at least 28 times more strongly to antiparallel microtubule pairs than to individual or parallel microtubules (Extended Experimental Procedures), indicating considerably higher selectivity for antiparallel microtubules than previously reported for Ase1 from fission yeast (Janson et al., 2007Janson M.E. Loughlin R. Loiodice I. Fu C. Brunner D. Nedelec F.J. Tran P.T. Crosslinkers and motors organize dynamic microtubules to form stable bipolar arrays in fission yeast.Cell. 2007; 128: 357-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanism of this high binding selectivity, we imaged single PRC1 molecules at higher temporal resolution. Many binding events of individual PRC1–Alexa 647 molecules were detected in antiparallel overlaps (Figure 1F, right), whereas hardly any events were observed in parallel microtubule pairs (Figure 1F, left). Individual PRC1 molecules were not statically bound but diffused in antiparallel overlaps (Figures S1C and S1D). Despite the high affinity for antiparallel microtubules, turnover of PRC1 in antiparallel overlaps was fast with a single-molecule half-life of around 1 s (Figure 1G, Figure S1E). Therefore, selective binding to antiparallel microtubules is an intrinsic property of the individual PRC1 dimer and it is very dynamic. This appears to distinguish PRC1 from Ase1 whose moderate selectivity for antiparallel microtubule binding was suggested to be a consequence of the formation of slowly dissociating oligomers (Kapitein et al., 2008Kapitein L.C. Janson M.E. van den Wildenberg S.M. Hoogenraad C.C. Schmidt C.F. Peterman E.J. Microtubule-driven multimerization recruits ase1p onto overlapping microtubules.Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 1713-1717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We next tested the additional effect of Xenopus kinesin-4 Xklp1 on microtubule overlap formation. In the presence of both 5 nM purified PRC1–Alexa 647 and 15 nM purified Xklp1–GFP (Figure S2), antiparallel microtubules connected to each other as soon as their plus ends encountered, forming an antiparallel microtubule overlap that remarkably reached a constant size after awhile (Figure 2A , Movie S2, and Movie S3). PRC1–Alexa 647 and also Xklp1–GFP were observed to strongly accumulate selectively in antiparallel but not parallel overlap regions (Figure 2B, Movie S2). Xklp1 had only a minor positive effect on the amount of overlap-associated PRC1 (Figure 2C). In contrast, no Xklp1 was observed in the absence of PRC1 in antiparallel microtubule overlaps (Figures 2D–2F). Microtubules often failed to form a tight bundle in the presence of Xklp1 only (Movie S4), a behavior never observed when PRC1 was present.Figure 2A Minimal Protein System Forms Stable Antiparallel Overlaps In VitroShow full caption(A) Time sequence of overlaid TIRF microscopy images of PRC1–Alexa 647 (red, 5 nM) and Xklp1–GFP (green, 15 nM) in a dynamic Alexa 568-labeled microtubule pair (blue) forming an antiparallel overlap at the indicated times in min:s.(B) TIRF images, recorded 4–9 min after the start of the experiment, showing several microtubules growing from immobilized microtubule seeds (top) and a kymograph of a selected microtubule pair (bottom).

Only weak nonspecific binding of the two Xklp1 proteins is seen. Lanes 2 and 3: beads with immobilized PRC1–SNAP incubated with either 2 μM full-length Xklp1–GFP (lanes 2) or truncated 2 μM Xklp1506–GFP (lanes 3) in the presence of 5 μM soluble tubulin.

(I) Average length (left) and average instantaneous growth velocity (right) of antiparallel overlaps (green, n = 9) and individual microtubules that are not part of a pair from the same experiment (blue, n = 18) formed in the presence of PRC1 and full-length Xklp1 as a function of time (conditions as in A and B). For comparison, the length of microtubule overlaps formed in the presence of only PRC1 (from Figure 1D) is shown (red dashed line). t = 0 is the moment of plus end-to-plus end encounter. Error bars are SD. Concentrations are as in (A). Horizontal scale bars are 10 μm. Vertical scale bars are 1 min. The frame rate for all time-lapse movies was 1 frame per 4.67 s. Kymographs start ∼1 min after the start of the experiment. See also Figure S2 and Movie S2, Movie S3, and Movie S4. These TIRF microscopy data indicate that Xklp1 interacts directly with PRC1, which we confirmed by pull-down experiments (Figure 2G, lane 2). Consequently, an N-terminal motor fragment, Xklp506–GFP, that does not interact with PRC1 (Figure 2G, lane 3) failed to accumulate in antiparallel microtubule overlaps despite the presence of PRC1–Alexa 647, as observed by TIRF microscopy (Figure 2H, right). This shows that a direct interaction between Xklp1 and PRC1 is required for PRC1-dependent recruitment of Xklp1 to antiparallel microtubule overlaps. The most striking observation in the presence of both midzone proteins was, however, that the growth of microtubule plus ends being part of an antiparallel overlap slowed down until it ceased completely in all observed cases (n > 100) (Figure 2A, kymograph in 2B, 2H, left, Movie S2, Movie S3). The growth of overlap microtubules gradually stopped within about 1 min after the end-to-end encounter (Figure 2I, green). In contrast, individual microtubules not engaged in overlaps in the same experiment continued growing with constant velocity of 2.1 ± 0.3 (mean ± SD) μm/min (Figure 2I, blue). Inhibition of antiparallel microtubule overlap growth was a consequence of the simultaneous presence of PRC1 and full-length Xklp1. The presence of neither PRC1 alone (Figures 1B–1D) nor Xklp1 alone (Figure 2F) had a significant effect on microtubule growth in antiparallel overlaps. Hence, stable antiparallel overlaps with a constant size of several micrometers formed only in the presence of both midzone proteins (Figures 2A, 2B, and 2I; Movie S3). Such antiparallel microtubule overlaps maintained a constant size over long periods of time despite the complete inhibition of microtubule growth. This is remarkable, given that slowdown of microtubule growth usually results in frequent transitions to microtubule depolymerization (catastrophes) (Arnal et al., 2004Arnal I. Heichette C.

Lipid interaction for both types of proteins is mediated by 11 amino acid repeats that form amphipathic helices. This similarity suggests that synucleins and apolipoproteins might have comparable effects on lipid membranes, but this has not been shown directly. Here, we find that α-synuclein, β-synuclein, and apolipoprotein A-1 have the conserved functional ability to induce membrane curvature and to convert large vesicles into highly curved membrane tubules and vesicles. The resulting structures are morphologically similar to those generated by amphiphysin, a curvature-inducing protein involved in endocytosis. Unlike amphiphysin, however, synucleins and apolipoproteins do not require any scaffolding domains and curvature induction is mediated by the membrane insertion and wedging of amphipathic helices alone. Moreover, we frequently observed that α-synuclein caused membrane structures that had the appearance of nascent budding vesicles. The ability to function as a minimal machinery for vesicle budding agrees well with recent findings that α-synuclein plays a role in vesicle trafficking and enhances endocytosis. Induction of membrane curvature must be under strict regulation in vivo; however, as we find it can also cause disruption of membrane integrity. Because the degree of membrane curvature induction depends on the concerted action of multiple proteins, controlling the local protein density of tubulating proteins may be important. How cellular safeguarding mechanisms prevent such potentially toxic events and whether they go awry in disease remains to be determined.

Although its physiological roles are not fully understood, it is thought that α-synuclein binds to synaptic vesicles, plays a role in neuronal plasticity, modulates the release of neurotransmitters, plays a role in vesicular trafficking and affects brain lipid metabolism (6Nemani V.M.

A role in endocytosis has recently been supported by the finding that overexpression of α-synuclein increases basal and evoked synaptic vesicle endocytosis in hippocampal neurons (15Ben Gedalya T.

However, α-synuclein has also been shown to be disruptive to the integrity of cellular membranes. Overexpression of α-synuclein in cell lines as well as animal models of PD have provided evidence for Golgi fragmentation (16Gosavi N. Lee H.J. Lee J.S. Patel S. Lee S.J. J. Biol.

Thus, a better understanding of α-synuclein-membrane interaction might help to shed light on its physiological as well as its pathological roles. A number of biophysical studies have concluded that the membrane interaction of α-synuclein is curvature-sensitive (27Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol.

Recent work revealed the existence of other proteins, mainly involved in membrane remodeling and vesicle trafficking events, with curvature-sensing abilities akin to those of α-synuclein (35Frost A. Unger V.M. De Camilli P. Cell. 2009; 137: 191-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 36McMahon H.T. Gallop J.L.

Interestingly, some of these proteins have the additional ability to convert moderately curved bilayers into small and highly curved vesicles or tubules (35Frost A. Unger V.M. De Camilli P. Cell. 2009; 137: 191-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 36McMahon H.T. Gallop J.L.

Endophilin and amphiphysin are examples of such curvature-inducing proteins involved in endocytosis. Both proteins have a highly curved BAR domain whose concave surface is rich in basic residues (39Gallop J.L. Jao C.C. Kent H.M. Butler P.J. Evans P.R. Langen R. McMahon H.T.

However, both proteins also have an N-terminal amphipathic helix which could promote curvature by wedging into the bilayer (36McMahon H.T. Gallop J.L.

In addition endophilin contains a central insert region, which also forms a membrane-inserting amphipathic helix (39Gallop J.L. Jao C.C. Kent H.M. Butler P.J. Evans P.R. Langen R. McMahon H.T.

Considering that the wedging of amphipathic helices alone might be sufficient to induce membrane curvature, we set out to test whether α-synuclein might be capable of this effect. The possibility that α-synuclein can induce morphological changes in membranes has been suggested (31Jao C.C. Hegde B.G. Chen J. Haworth I.S. Langen R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Hughes E. Doig A.J. Middleton D.A. Mol. Membr Biol. 2008; 25: 518-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), but it has not been investigated in detail. For example, it is not clear whether such interactions predominantly promote increased or decreased membrane curvature, as α-synuclein has been reported to increase as well as decrease vesicle size (31Jao C.C. Hegde B.G. Chen J. Haworth I.S. Langen R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 19666-19671Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 47Bodner C.R. Dobson C.M. Bax A. J. Mol.

Several studies have reported that membrane interaction of α-synuclein, as well as that of other amyloid proteins, can cause projections to emanate from vesicles. While it has been suggested that these projections are membrane tubules induced by the α-helical form (47Bodner C.R. Dobson C.M. Bax A. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 390: 775-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), they have often been considered to be derived from β-sheet-rich fibrils or other misfolded forms that were mixed with lipids (49Necula M.

To further test whether the ability to induce membrane curvature might be a shared property of α-synuclein and related 11 amino acid repeat-containing proteins, we also included β-synuclein and apolipoprotein A-1 (apoA-1) in the present study. As with α-synuclein, the 11 amino acid repeat regions of both of these proteins can also form amphipathic helices that interact with membranes (53Davidson W.S. Thompson T.B. J. Biol.

ApoA-1 interacts with membranes and lipid particles in vivo and is known to play an important role in lipid metabolism (53Davidson W.S. Thompson T.B. J. Biol.

In vitro apolipoproteins are known to form lipid-containing disks but the mechanisms by which they form are not well understood (59Silva R.A. Huang R. Morris J. Fang J. Gracheva E.O. Ren G.

Whereas it has long been suspected that synucleins and apolipoproteins might have similar effects on lipid membranes, this has not been shown directly. The human α-synuclein and β-synuclein were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells and generated as reported earlier (60Der-Sarkissian A. Jao C.C. Chen J. Langen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37530-37535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed by boiling, followed by acid precipitation. Supernatant was passed through anion exchange columns, and eluted with a 0–1.0 m NaCl gradient. The human β-synuclein was further subjected to gel filtration using Superdex 200 column. Human apoA-I containing a hexa-His affinity tag at the N terminus was expressed in E. coli strain BL21 Star (DE3) cells (Invitrogen) using a pET-20b vector as described previously (61Lagerstedt J.O. Budamagunta M.S. Oda M.N. Voss J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9143-9149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). ApoA-I was purified on a His-Trap-Nickel-chelating (GE) column using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4 with 3 m guanidine. The protein was then washed in PBS (pH 7.4) containing 100 mm imidazole, and then eluted with PBS containing 500 mm imidazole. Imidazole was removed from the protein sample by using Bio-spin columns (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with PBS, pH 7.4. The plasmid containing His6-tagged N-BAR domain (amino acids 1–244) of Drosophila amphiphysin was kindly provided by Dr. Harvey McMahon (Medical Research Council). The protein was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS cells and purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose, followed by Superdex 200 gel filtration, and finally monoS cation exchange chromatography was performed using buffer gradient composed of the following two buffers: buffer A (20 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and buffer B (20 mm Hepes pH 7.4 2 m NaCl and 1 mm DTT) with the protein eluting around 600 mm NaCl. The following synthetic lipids were used to prepare different membrane compositions: 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (POPS), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-RAC-(1-glycerol)] (POPG), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (DOPS), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), cholesterol, sphingomyelin. All lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. (Alabaster, AL). Large non-extruded vesicles used for electron microscopy studies were prepared by vortexing the dried lipid film in the required buffer. Addition of 2 mm EGTA to the buffer showed that the observed tubulation does not depend on metal ions such as Ca2+ (supplemental Fig. S5C). The ability of α-synuclein to clear large lipid vesicles was monitored by measuring change in light scattering as a function of time using a Jasco V-550 UV/Visible spectrophotometer. The monitoring wavelength was set at 500 nm with a slit width of 2 nm and medium response time. Briefly, lipid vesicles were suspended in 20 mm Hepes pH 7.4 with 100 mm NaCl at a final volume of 500 μl in a quartz cuvette. All CD spectra were obtained using a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter with 1 mm quartz cell at room temperature. A scan rate of 50 nm/minute, bandwidth of 1 nm, 0.1 nm time response and step resolution of 0.5 nm was used for all experiments. Protein concentration was determined using the extinction coefficient of protein at 280 nm based on the number of tryptophan and tyrosine molecules in the protein. Appropriate blanks were collected under similar conditions and were subtracted to obtain the final spectra. A 10 mm sodium phosphate pH 7.4 buffer was used for all CD studies. Giant vesicles were prepared as follows: Lipid mixtures were prepared with POPG, POPG/POPE (1:1), POPG/POPC (1:1), and supplemented with 0.5% 1,2 dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE)-Atto633 (Attotec) and 0.5% DOPE-biotin (Avanti). A thin lipid film was formed in a teflon cup and rehydrated overnight at 37 °C. Liposomes were prepared with 2 days of rehydration at 37 °C and no extrusion. The giant liposomes were immobilized on an assay surface and incubated with protein for 30 min at room temperature. Alexa488-labeled α-synuclein was obtained by reacting α-synuclein Y136C derivative with 10× molar excess of Alexa-488 (Invitrogen) for 4 h. Unreacted dye was removed by gel filtration using PD-10 column (GE). Glass surfaces were passivated with a BSA:BSA-Biotin mixture and subsequently coated with streptavidin onto which the biotinylated vesicles tethered, as described previously (62Bhatia V.K. Madsen K.L. Bolinger P.Y. Kunding A. Hedegård P. Gether U. Stamou D. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 3303-3314Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Microscopy was performed on a Leica TCS SP5 Confocal Fluorescence Microscope, with an AOBS/AOTF system allowing tunable wavelength detection intervals. The objective used was an oil immersion HCX PL APO with ×100 magnification and numerical aperture 1.4. Alexa488-labeled α-synuclein was excited at 488 nm, using an argon laser, while detecting from 495 nm to 555 nm. Vesicles containing DOPE-Atto633 dye were excited at 633 nm, detecting from 640 nm to 790 nm. Both channels were recorded simultaneously for the duration of the experiment, with a time resolution of ∼1.5 s. The microscope was kept at a constant temperature of 22 °C. Samples were negatively stained for transmission electron microscopy studies. Carbon-coated formvar films mounted on copper grids (EMS) were floated on a 10-μl droplet of sample for 5 min and the excess liquid was removed from the grids with a filter paper. The grids were then stained with 2% uranyl acetate. A JEOL 1400 transmission electron microscope accelerated to 100 kV was used for specimen observation. Leakage assay was modified from a previous method (63Wimley W.C. Selsted M.E. White S.H. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1362-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) composed of either 66%POPG/33%POPE, 100% POPG or POPG/POPC (1:1 molar ratio) were prepared by resuspending dried lipid in 9 mm ANTS (8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid, disodium salt) and 25 mm DPX [p-xylene-bis(pyridinium bromide)] (Invitrogen). This lipid solution was treated to 10 cycles of freeze/thaw, and large 1 μm diameter vesicles were formed by passing lipid mixture through mini-extruder (20×) with 1 μm cutoff polycarbonate membrane (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc.) Unencapsulated dye was removed by gel filtration using PD-10 column (GE). 100% leakage was attained using a final concentration of 0.04% Triton-X 100. All data were normalized to 100% leakage. Fluorescence measurements were recorded using a JASCO fluorometer (FP-6500), setting excitation and emission at 380 nm and 520 nm with slits of 5 nm and 20 nm, respectively. To test whether α-synuclein can induce changes in the shape and size of phospholipid vesicles, we incubated α-synuclein with large, POPG-containing vesicles and visually inspected the vesicle suspension. This assay is analogous to those previously established for investigating effects of apolipoproteins and detergents on vesicle structure (64Vinson P.K. Talmon Y. Walter A. Biophys. J. 1989; 56: 669-681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 65Mishra V.K. Palgunachari M.N. Datta G. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. Adeyeye S.O. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1602-1611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Because of their large size, non-extruded vesicles exhibit strong scattering and have a milky appearance (Fig. 1A). Remarkably, after only 1 h of incubation with α-synuclein, the vesicle suspension became completely clear. In a more quantitative approach, we monitored the light scattering by recording the absorption of the suspension at 500 nm. As shown in Fig. 1B, the decrease in scatter exhibited very fast kinetics for the first 5 min and then began to level off. This effect was dose-dependent, as increasing amounts of α-synuclein progressively reduced scattering of the vesicle suspension. These results showed that α-synuclein can remodel large POPG-containing vesicles into smaller structural entities. In contrast, no change was observed when analogous experiments were performed using large vesicles containing the zwitterionic POPC. Measurements using circular dichroism and ThT fluorescence enhancement revealed that the membrane-clearing effect of α-synuclein was mediated by its α-helical rather than a misfolded β-sheet conformation (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, α-synuclein converted from a random coil in solution into a membrane-bound helical structure at a rate that closely matched that of vesicle clearing (Fig. 1D). Thereafter, the sample retained its helical structure for days (supplemental Fig. S1A). In an effort to directly visualize the interaction of α-synuclein with POPG-containing vesicles, we performed optical imaging experiments with immobilized uni- and multilamellar giant vesicles in an aqueous environment (62Bhatia V.K.

After addition of α-synuclein (∼1:50 protein/lipid [P/L] molar ratio); however, they lost their spherical integrity (Fig. 2A). This process was completed within ∼15 min. At lower P/L ratios, only a fraction of the giant vesicles was disrupted within the same timeframe in good agreement with the light scattering data (Fig. 1B). Above a certain threshold concentration of added protein, vesicles disrupted very quickly, on a time scale faster than the experimental time resolution of ∼1.5 s. The deformation of a single giant vesicle is depicted in Fig. 2B, which shows corresponding images (t = 0, 1.5 s, 3 s) of a vesicle (red) and bound α-synuclein (green).

Here, we combine structural and single molecule fluorescence methods to examine how PRC1, the human MAP65, crosslinks antiparallel microtubules. We find that PRC1's microtubule binding is mediated by a structured domain with a spectrin-fold and an unstructured Lys/Arg-rich domain. These two domains, at each end of a homodimer, are connected by a linkage that is flexible on single microtubules, but forms well-defined crossbridges between antiparallel filaments. Further, we show that PRC1 crosslinks are compliant and do not substantially resist filament sliding by motor proteins in vitro. Together, our data show how MAP65s, by combining structural flexibility and rigidity, tune microtubule associations to establish crosslinks that selectively “mark” antiparallel overlap in dynamic cytoskeletal networks.

It is now clear that different cytoskeletal architectures arise from the interplay between motor proteins, which can crosslink and move microtubules relative to one another, and nonmotor microtubule associated proteins (MAPs), which can crosslink microtubules to stabilize specific orientations (Glotzer, 2009Glotzer M.

While we have good biophysical and structural models for motor proteins that crosslink microtubules, much less is known about nonmotor microtubule crosslinking proteins. Several nonmotor MAPs that crosslink microtubules (e.g., MAP65, NuMA, NuSAP and Mia1p) are now known to play important roles in dividing and nondividing cells (Ribbeck et al., 2006Ribbeck K.

Tech. 2000; 49: 467-477Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Current models for the functions of these proteins are based on cellular localizations and loss-of-function studies. However, we lack any structural data to explain how microtubule crosslinking is achieved by these MAPs. Recently, there have been several advances in our understanding of the structure of nonmotor MAPs. Among the best characterized class of MAPs are the +TIP proteins (e.g., XMAP215, EB1 and CLIP170), which can dynamically track the growing end of a microtubule. Microtubule binding in these proteins is mediated by calponin-homology, CAP/Gly or TOG domains (Slep and Vale, 2007Slep K.C. Vale R.D. Structural basis of microtubule plus end tracking by XMAP215, CLIP-170, and EB1.Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 976-991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Similarly, structural work on Ndc80, a conserved mitotic MAP, has revealed how a calpolin-homology domain may be used to establish kinetochore-microtubule associations during cell division (Ciferri et al., 2008Ciferri C. Pasqualato S. Screpanti E. Varetti G. Santaguida S. Dos Reis G. Maiolica A. Polka J. De Luca J.G.

However, due to lack of similarity in primary sequence, it is not very likely that these structural models will shed light on nonmotor MAPs that can crosslink two microtubules. As a step toward developing structural models for how nonmotor MAPs may crosslink microtubules, we focused on the conserved MAP65 family, which plays key roles in microtubule organization in eukaryotes. Since their initial discovery in budding yeast, microtubule crosslinking functions of the MAP65 proteins have been shown to be required for cell shape maintenance in yeast cells, directional cell expansion in plants and formation of the central spindle in eukaryotes (Chan et al., 1999Chan J. Jensen C.G. Jensen L.C. Bush M. Lloyd C.W. The 65-kDa carrot microtubule-associated protein forms regularly arranged filamentous cross-bridges between microtubules.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cell. 2005; 16: 1378-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Currently, at least three activities have been ascribed to these proteins. First, MAP65s can selectively crosslink microtubules in an antiparallel orientation (Gaillard et al., 2008Gaillard J. Neumann E. Van Damme D. Stoppin-Mellet V. Ebel C. Barbier E. Geelen D. Vantard M.

Ase1p organizes antiparallel microtubule arrays during interphase and mitosis in fission yeast.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1756-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Second, these nonmotor crosslinkers can oppose filament movements driven by motor proteins. For example, Ase1, the fungal MAP65, is proposed to antagonize kinesin-14 driven filament sliding required for organizing microtubules during interphase (Janson et al., 2007Janson M.E. Loughlin R. Loiodice I. Fu C. Brunner D. Nedelec F.J. Tran P.T. Crosslinkers and motors organize dynamic microtubules to form stable bipolar arrays in fission yeast.Cell. 2007; 128: 357-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Third, these crosslinking proteins can recruit signaling proteins or kinesins to the microtubule structures they stabilize. For example, the recruitment of Polo-like kinase to the central spindle during cytokinesis is mediated via interactions with PRC1, the human MAP65 (Neef et al., 2007Neef R. Gruneberg U. Kopajtich R. Li X. Nigg E.A. Sillje H. Barr F.A. Choice of Plk1 docking partners during mitosis and cytokinesis is controlled by the activation state of Cdk1.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 436-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and kinesin-5 driven microtubule sliding during anaphase depends on Ase1 (Khmelinskii et al., 2009Khmelinskii A. Roostalu J. Roque H. Antony C. Schiebel E. Phosphorylation-dependent protein interactions at the spindle midzone mediate cell cycle regulation of spindle elongation.Dev. Cell. 2009; 17: 244-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Currently, we do not have a structural framework to explain how these MAPs specifically crosslink antiparallel microtubules. Moreover, the activities of MAP65s have not been reconstituted in the presence of motor proteins to test if MAP65s resist filament sliding by motor proteins or if their main function is to act as “marks” that recruit other proteins to regions of antiparallel microtubule overlap in dynamic networks. Here we show, using single molecule fluorescence microscopy assays, X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy that PRC1 uses structured and unstructured domains to bind microtubules. These domains at each end of a PRC1 homodimer are connected by a linker that adopts a rigid conformation only when crosslinking microtubules. We also show, in assays combining TIRF and fluorescent speckle microscopy (FSM), that PRC1 does not substantially resist filament sliding by kinesin-5. Based on these results, we propose a model for how a crosslinking MAP can achieve specific and compliant crosslinking of microtubules by balancing structural rigidity and flexibility. PRC1, like other Map65 family proteins, has a modular architecture with an N-terminal coiled-coil domain, a central region that can mediate microtubule binding, and a C-terminal regulatory domain (Figure 1A ). While the central domain is thought to be required for microtubule binding, the contributions of the C-terminal domain remain poorly characterized. To address this, we analyzed the microtubule binding activity of PRC1 using two approaches, a TIRF microscopy assay to examine the properties of single molecules and a microtubule cosedimentation assay to analyze equilibrium binding. For visualizing PRC1 molecules by fluorescence microscopy we expressed and purified recombinant GFP-tagged full-length PRC1 in bacteria. We found that C-terminal tags on PRC1 resulted in constructs that were highly unstable and therefore used a construct with GFP fused to the N-terminus of PRC1 (GFP-PRC1-FL). We first examined the oligomerization state of single GFP-PRC1-FL molecules. Analysis of the intensities of single fluorescent spots of GFP-PRC1-FL immobilized on a glass coverslip, when compared to intensities of known dimeric and tetrameric reference constructs, indicated that GFP-PRC1-FL is a dimer (Figure 1B), similar to the yeast homolog, Ase1 (Kapitein et al., 2008aKapitein L.C. Janson M.E. van den Wildenberg S.M. Hoogenraad C.C. Schmidt C.F. Peterman E.J. Microtubule-driven multimerization recruits ase1p onto overlapping microtubules.Curr.

Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). We also confirmed that untagged PRC1 is a homo-dimer and has an extended conformation (see below, and data not shown). Previous studies have suggested that PRC1 exists as a homo-tetramer, but gel filtration chromatography alone can sometimes be unreliable for such analyses of proteins with elongated structures (Zhu et al., 2006Zhu C. Lau E. Schwarzenbacher R. Bossy-Wetzel E. Jiang W. Spatiotemporal control of spindle midzone formation by PRC1 in human cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 6196-6201Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To examine the interaction of single PRC1 molecules with a microtubule, we used streptavidin to attach X-rhodamine-labeled, biotinylated microtubules to a glass surface. After blocking the glass surface, we added low concentrations of GFP-PRC1-FL (20 pM) (Figure 1C). Similar to what is observed for Ase1, we found that single GFP-PRC1-FL molecules diffuse in 1-D along the microtubule surface (Figure S1D and 1E ; (Kapitein et al., 2008aKapitein L.C. Janson M.E. van den Wildenberg S.M. Hoogenraad C.C. Schmidt C.F. Peterman E.J. Microtubule-driven multimerization recruits ase1p onto overlapping microtubules.Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 1713-1717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar)). Analysis of time-lapse sequences using kymographs showed that individual GFP-PRC1-FL molecules can maintain associations with the microtubule lattice that can last several seconds (t1/2 = 7 ± 0.4 s; Figure 1H). To examine the contribution of the C terminus of PRC1 to microtubule binding, we first generated a construct comprised of just the N-terminal dimerization and the microtubule-binding domain (aa 1–466, hereafter GFP-PRC1-NS). Intensity distribution of GFP-PRC1-NS indicated that this construct, like the full-length protein, is a dimer (Figure 1B). We were unable to detect microtubule associations of single molecules of GFP-PRC1-NS at the concentrations needed to resolve single molecules using TIRF microscopy (<10 nM; data not shown), suggesting that residues in the C terminus domain contribute to microtubule binding. Secondary structure algorithms predict that the C-terminal domain in PRC1 is likely to be unstructured. Consistent with this prediction, we find that PRC1's C terminus is prone to proteolysis. A highly susceptible cleavage site resides between two Lys/Arg-rich basic clusters in this domain (aa. Asn 500; Figure S1 available online). As basic amino acids are often implicated in mediating interactions with the negatively charged microtubules surface, we generated a GFP-fused PRC1 construct with one of the two basic-residue clusters (aa 1–486, hereafter GFP-PRC1-NSΔC). Under TIRF microscopy conditions we could readily observe microtubule binding by single GFP-PRC1-NSΔC molecules. Diffusion on the microtubule was apparent for the subset of binding events that lasted several seconds (Figures 1F and 1G). Analysis of the life-times of microtubule association indicated that this construct has a higher microtubule unbinding rate than the full-length protein (Figure 1H, lifetime is less than the lower limit of reliable event detection, < 3 s). Increasing salt concentrations reduced the GFP-PRC1-NSΔC binding lifetimes, consistent with a charge-dependent microtubule-binding interaction mediated by PRC1's C terminus (Figures 1I–1K). We next carried out microtubule cosedimentation assays for an independent analysis of the contribution of the C-terminal domain to PRC1's microtubule interaction. For these experiments we generated PRC1 constructs lacking the dimerization domain so that we could exclude the potentially complex effects of filament crosslinking/bundling on this analysis (Figure 2A ). These PRC1 constructs were confirmed to be monomeric by size exclusion chromatography (data not shown). The microtubule binding affinity (Kd) of a construct comprising of the central domain and the C terminus (aa 341–620, named PRC1-SC) was 0.6 ± 0.3 μM (Figures 2B and 2D). A construct comprising of the central domain alone (aa 341–466, hereafter named PRC1-S) had a ∼5-fold weaker binding (Kd: 3.3 ± 1.8 μM; Figures 2C and 2D). Interestingly, we observe cooperative microtubule binding by PRC1-SC (Hill coefficient of 3 ± 1). This suggests that the C terminus may be responsible for interactions between PRC1 molecules on the microtubule lattice analogous to what has been previously reported for Ase1 (Kapitein et al., 2008aKapitein L.C. Janson M.E. van den Wildenberg S.M. Hoogenraad C.C. Schmidt C.F. Peterman E.J. Microtubule-driven multimerization recruits ase1p onto overlapping microtubules.Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 1713-1717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Together, these data indicate that PRC1's microtubule binding is mediated by two regions, one that is predicted to be structured and another, unstructured region, rich in Lys/Arg residues. To determine the structural basis of microtubule binding by PRC1, we focused on its central microtubule-binding domain. As this domain has no obvious homology to any known microtubule binding motif, we used X-ray crystallography to determine its structure. Nonisomorphous crystals of the PRC1-S construct were obtained from both the native protein, which diffracted to 1.75 Å resolution, and the selenomethionyl-substituted protein, which diffracted to 2.0 Å resolution. The structure of the selenomethionyl-substituted protein was solved by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion, refined, and, subsequently used as a model to solve the structure of the native protein using molecular replacement (Table S1). We found that the microtubule-binding domain of PRC1 is an ∼70 Å long 3-helix bundle (labeled helix-1, -2, and -3), with connecting loops (labeled loop1-2 and loop2-3) and N- and C- termini at opposite ends (Figure 3A and Figures S2A and S2B ). Residues from all three helices contribute to a hydrophobic core which dominates the interface between the three helices (Figure 3B). This core is flanked on both ends of the helix bundle by two salt bridges mediated by conserved residues (Figure 3C).Figure S2Comparisons of Native and Selenomethionyl Crystal Structures and Characterization of Alanine Mutants to Map the Microtubule Binding Surface of PRC1-S, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Overlay of the native (orange) and the selenomethionine PRC1-S crystal structures (blue; rmsd = 2.4 Å).(B) Overlay of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit of the native protein crystal (rmsd = 0.4 Å, pdb reference: molecule- A [orange] and -B [blue]).(C) SDS-PAGE of the PRC1-S mutants.

(D) Gel filtration chromatography shows that all the mutants are monomeric similar to the wild-type PRC1-S protein. Using DALI, we found that PRC1-S has high structural similarity to spectrin domains (Figure 3D), motifs commonly found in proteins associated with the actin cytoskeleton (e.g., alpha-actinin, spectrin and dystrophin; (Djinovic-Carugo et al., 2002Djinovic-Carugo K. Gautel M. Ylanne J. Young P. The spectrin repeat: a structural platform for cytoskeletal protein assemblies.FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 119-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar)). However, a spectrin fold has not thus far been found in any other known MAP. Interestingly, in actin-binding proteins, the elongated and rigid triple-helix of a spectrin domain does not directly mediate actin binding, but acts as a spacer between canonical actin-binding motifs, such as calponin homology domains. Therefore, it appears that the spectrin fold has been evolutionarily ‘recycled’ and re-engineered to act as a microtubule interacting domain in the Map65 protein family. These findings establish a new role for the spectrin motif as a microtubule-binding domain. As it was unclear how the spectrin fold would bind microtubules, we analyzed the electrostatic surface potential and the conservation of surface residues for this domain. A map of the electrostatic surface potential shows a positively charged region comprising of loop1-2 and residues from all three helices that are proximal to this loop in the three dimensional structure (Figure 3E). Interestingly, a cluster of highly conserved residues is also located within this region (Figure 3F), suggesting that the junction of helix-1 and helix-2 could form the microtubule binding region in the spectrin fold. To test this hypothesis we generated constructs of PRC1's spectrin domain in which basic residues in this region were mutated to alanine (Figure S2C). Each of these constructs was characterized to be monomeric by size-exclusion chromatography (Figure S2D). We used microtubule cosedimentation assays to compare microtubule binding of mutant and wild-type PRC1-S constructs (Figure 3G). We found that mutation of each of the basic residues in the most conserved region reduced microtubule binding 2- to 4-fold, though none of the individual mutations abolished microtubule binding (Figure 3H). To test that the observed microtubule binding is not simply a nonspecific electrostatic interaction, we tested two other constructs. First, we made a C terminus truncation in PRC1-SC (labeled del453–466; aa 341–452) to remove three surface exposed lysines on helix-3. Second, we generated a construct in which a lysine residue on helix-2 (K407), distal to the potential microtubule binding site, was mutated to alanine. Both of these constructs show less than 50% reduction in microtubule binding. From this analysis, we propose that the spectrin domain in PRC1 uses a basic surface comprising of conserved residues at one end of the triple helix bundle to mediate microtubule binding (Figure 3F, circle). To investigate the interaction of PRC1 with the microtubule lattice we examined the structure of dimeric PRC1 bound to single microtubules by cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) and helical image analysis. As PRC1-FL extensively bundles microtubules at concentrations needed for this analysis, we used our findings from single molecule experiments to engineer a construct PRC1-NSΔC (aa 1–486; Figure 4A ), which was more suitable for this analysis (Figure 1A). This construct was confirmed to be dimeric by HPLC Size Exclusion Chromatography/Laser Light Scattering Analysis (Figure S3), and found to retain sufficient binding to fully decorate single microtubules without extensive bundling.Figure S3Analysis of the Oligomerization State of PRC1 Constructs, Related to Figure 1, Figure 4Show full caption(A) HPLC Size Exclusion Chromatography/ Laser Light Scattering analysis of PRC1-NSΔC (aa.1-486).

Diffraction of individual cryo-EM images of PRC1-NSΔC bound to microtubules showed an 80 Å layer line, indicating that one PRC1-NSΔC molecule binds a α/β-tubulin heterodimer. The 3D reconstruction of microtubule bound PRC1-NSΔC showed a single rod-shaped density corresponding to PRC1-NSΔC, protruding approximately perpendicular to the microtubule lattice (microtubule side view, Figure 4B; top view, Figure 4C). Interestingly, the PRC1 density in the reconstruction is of the same size as PRC1's spectrin domain. The optimal fit of the spectrin domain crystal structure to the reconstructions oriented the conserved, basic residues at the junction of helix-1 and helix-2 toward the microtubule lattice (Figure 4D and 4E). This binding model is also consistent with our site-directed mutagenesis analysis (Figure 3H). Comparison of the 3D reconstruction of this complex with cryo-EM structures of motor proteins (e.g kinesin and dynein's microtubule-binding domain) bound to microtubules suggests that the binding site for PRC1 partially overlaps with, but is not identical to, the microtubule-binding surface used by motor proteins (Carter et al., 2008Carter A.P. Garbarino J.E. Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Shipley W.E. Cho C. Milligan R.A. Vale R.D. Gibbons I.R. Structure and functional role of dynein's microtubule-binding domain.Science. 2008; 322: 1691-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar; Figure S4B ). Surprisingly, we see no extra density distal to the microtubule surface that would correspond to the N-terminus coiled-coil dimerization domain in PRC1-NSΔC. This indicates that the coiled-coil domain is likely to be flexible and can have more than one conformation when bound to a single microtubule. To further understand the PRC1-microtubule interaction, we obtained a second EM reconstruction with a monomeric construct that lacked most of the oligomerization domain but contained the spectrin domain and the entire C terminus (aa 303–620). The observed density for this construct overlaps with the PRC1-NSΔC density close to the microtubule lattice (Figures S4C–S4E). We also observe some additional density distal to the microtubule surface which is not observed in PRC1-NSΔC. It is possible that this density corresponds to PRC1's C terminus folding back to interact with the spectrin domain or to the amino acids at PRC1's N-terminus that may be ordered when this construct binds microtubules. As we do not observe any additional density past the C terminus of the spectrin domain that is close to the microtubule lattice, we favor the possibility that the Lys/Arg-rich domain is disordered even when PRC1 is bound to a microtubule. Together, these data show that PRC1's spectrin domain is highly ordered and less flexible than the other domains when associated with a single microtubule. Helical reconstructions suggest that PRC1 may not be an inherently rigid molecule when bound to one microtubule. It is difficult to explain how a flexible protein with two microtubule interaction surfaces at opposite ends of dimer can achieve the crosslinking specificity reported for MAP65 proteins (Gaillard et al., 2008Gaillard J. Neumann E. Van Damme D. Stoppin-Mellet V. Ebel C. Barbier E. Geelen D. Vantard M. Two microtubule-associated proteins of Arabidopsis MAP65s promote antiparallel microtubule bundling.Mol. Biol.

Using spermatogonial progenitor cells (SPCs) as a model system, we show that mTORC1 impairs stem cell maintenance by a negative feedback from mTORC1 to receptors required to transduce niche-derived signals. We find that SPCs lacking Plzf, a transcription factor essential for SPC maintenance, have enhanced mTORC1 activity. Aberrant mTORC1 activation in Plzf(-/-) SPCs inhibits their response to GDNF, a growth factor critical for SPC self-renewal, via negative feedback at the level of the GDNF receptor. Plzf opposes mTORC1 activity by inducing expression of the mTORC1 inhibitor Redd1. Thus, we identify the mTORC1-Plzf functional interaction as a critical rheostat for maintenance of the spermatogonial pool and propose a model whereby negative feedback from mTORC1 to the GDNF receptor balances SPC growth with self-renewal."
https://openalex.org/W2016702459,"Background Understanding the distribution of marine biodiversity is a crucial first step towards the effective and sustainable management of marine ecosystems. Recent efforts to collate location records from marine surveys enable us to assemble a global picture of recorded marine biodiversity. They also effectively highlight gaps in our knowledge of particular marine regions. In particular, the deep pelagic ocean – the largest biome on Earth – is chronically under-represented in global databases of marine biodiversity. Methodology/Principal Findings We use data from the Ocean Biogeographic Information System to plot the position in the water column of ca 7 million records of marine species occurrences. Records from relatively shallow waters dominate this global picture of recorded marine biodiversity. In addition, standardising the number of records from regions of the ocean differing in depth reveals that regardless of ocean depth, most records come either from surface waters or the sea bed. Midwater biodiversity is drastically under-represented. Conclusions/Significance The deep pelagic ocean is the largest habitat by volume on Earth, yet it remains biodiversity's big wet secret, as it is hugely under-represented in global databases of marine biological records. Given both its value in the provision of a range of ecosystem services, and its vulnerability to threats including overfishing and climate change, there is a pressing need to increase our knowledge of Earth's largest ecosystem."

https://openalex.org/W2162328639,"Opposing roles of Aurora kinases and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) during mitosis have long been suggested. Here, we demonstrate that Aurora kinases A and B phosphorylate a conserved residue on the kinetochore motor CENP-E. PP1 binds CENP-E via a motif overlapping this phosphorylation site and binding is disrupted by Aurora phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of CENP-E by the Auroras is enriched at spindle poles, disrupting binding of PP1 and reducing CENP-E's affinity for individual microtubules. This phosphorylation is required for CENP-E-mediated towing of initially polar chromosomes toward the cell center. Kinetochores on such chromosomes cannot make subsequent stable attachment to spindle microtubules when dephosphorylation of CENP-E or rebinding of PP1 to CENP-E is blocked. Thus, an Aurora/PP1 phosphorylation switch modulates CENP-E motor activity as an essential feature of chromosome congression from poles and localized PP1 delivery by CENP-E to the outer kinetochore is necessary for stable microtubule capture by those chromosomes.

Each time a cell divides, a specialized proteinaceous structure called the kinetochore assembles on the surface of each centromere, and it is the kinetochore that binds to spindle microtubules and directs chromosome motion during mitosis (Cleveland et al., 2003Cleveland D.W. Mao Y. Sullivan K.F. Centromeres and Kinetochores: From Epigenetics to Mitotic Checkpoint Signaling.Cell. 2003; 112: 407-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Microtubule capture by the kinetochore is a stochastic process. Initial kinetochore attachment is often mediated via an interaction with the lateral surface of a microtubule, and kinetochores attached in this manner undergo rapid, dynein-mediated poleward motion (Rieder and Alexander, 1990Rieder C.L. Alexander S.P. Kinetochores are transported poleward along a single astral microtubule during chromosome attachment to the spindle in newt lung cells.J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 81-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Although some chromosomes achieve biorientation without being transported to the spindle pole, dynein-mediated transport is an important mechanism to collect chromosomes to a common microtubule-dense region, where kinetochores have a greater chance of promoting efficient chromosome alignment. Congression of polar-localized chromosomes to a metaphase position is powered by a processive, plus end-directed kinetochore motor CENP-E (Kinesin-7) (Kapoor et al., 2006Kapoor T.M.

In various cell types and organisms, removal or inhibition of CENP-E leads to a failure in complete metaphase chromosome alignment, with a few unattached chromosomes found close to the spindle poles (Putkey et al., 2002Putkey F.R.

Even the kinetochores that do become bioriented and fully aligned in the absence of CENP-E stably bind only half as many microtubules (Putkey et al., 2002Putkey F.R. Cramer T. Morphew M.K. Silk A.D.

Heuser J.E. Waterman C.M. Cleveland D.W. CENP-E combines a slow, processive motor and a flexible coiled coil to produce an essential motile kinetochore tether.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) raises the possibility that, while it can work advantageously for initial capture, CENP-E may also contribute, in part, to the inappropriate attachments of kinetochores. Indeed, the process of capturing spindle microtubules by kinetochores is prone to errors. Undesirable attachment frequently occurs in early prometaphase, with a single kinetochore capturing microtubules from both spindle poles (merotelic attachment), or both sister kinetochores attached to the same pole (syntelic attachment) (Cimini and Degrassi, 2005Cimini D. Degrassi F. Aneuploidy: a matter of bad connections.Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 442-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These improper kinetochore attachments, if not resolved, can lead to chromosome missegregation and aneuploidy (Holland and Cleveland, 2009Holland A.J. Cleveland D.W.

While budding yeast has a single Aurora kinase Ipl1, metazoans express at least two Aurora kinases, Aurora A and B. Like Ipl1, Aurora B is a component of the chromosome passenger complex (together with INCENP, Survivin, and Borealin/Dasra) and is targeted to the inner centromere from prophase to metaphase (Ruchaud et al., 2007Ruchaud S. Carmena M. Earnshaw W.C. Chromosomal passengers: conducting cell division.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 798-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Aurora B is thought to aid chromosome biorientation by destabilizing the kinetochore-microtubule interaction of improperly attached chromosomes (Cimini et al., 2006Cimini D. Wan X. Hirel C.B.

Recently, the non-essential yeast protein Fin1 and conserved kinetochore protein KNL1 have been identified to target some PP1 to yeast and vertebrate kinetochores, respectively (Akiyoshi et al., 2009Akiyoshi B.

Phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail of CENP-E by Cdk1, MAPK, or Mps1 has been previously proposed either to regulate CENP-E motor activity prior to its binding to kinetochores (Espeut et al., 2008Espeut J. Gaussen A. Bieling P. Morin V. Prieto S. Fesquet D. Surrey T. Abrieu A. Phosphorylation Relieves Autoinhibition of the Kinetochore Motor Cenp-E.Mol.

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1547-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Additionally, among a proteomic screen of 260 mitotic phosphoproteins, CENP-E was identified to be multiply phosphorylated during mitosis (Nousiainen et al., 2006Nousiainen M. Sillje H.H. Sauer G. Nigg E.A. Korner R. Phosphoproteome analysis of the human mitotic spindle.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 5391-5396Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). However, the significance of the phosphorylations of CENP-E has not been established. Using purified components, selective inhibitors and a phosphospecific antibody, here we demonstrate that Aurora kinases, both A and B, phosphorylate a single conserved residue close to the CENP-E motor domain. We also identify a docking motif for PP1 that overlaps the site of phosphorylation and demonstrate that PP1 binding to CENP-E is disrupted by Aurora-mediated phosphorylation. Our findings establish an Aurora/PP1 phosphorylation switch that is required not only for congression of polar chromosomes through modulation of the intrinsic motor properties of CENP-E, but also for subsequent stable biorientation of those chromosomes by CENP-E's delivery of PP1 to the outer kinetochore. In searching for the origin of the one-dimensional diffusion found in CENP-E motility (Kim et al., 2008Kim Y. Heuser J.E. Waterman C.M. Cleveland D.W. CENP-E combines a slow, processive motor and a flexible coiled coil to produce an essential motile kinetochore tether.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), we identified a highly conserved stretch of basic residues downstream of the CENP-E coiled-coil neck (Figure 1A ). Consisting of four or more consecutive arginines or lysines, this basic stretch and the following threonine (422 in human and 424 in Xenopus laevis) are conserved in almost all the eukaryotes that possess a clear CENP-E homolog. Interestingly, the conserved threonine resides in a consensus motif for phosphorylation by Aurora kinase (Cheeseman et al., 2002Cheeseman I.M. Anderson S. Jwa M. Green E.M. Kang J.-s. Yates J.R. Chan C.S.M. Drubin D.G. Barnes G. Phosphoregulation of Kinetochore-Microtubule Attachments by the Aurora Kinase Ipl1p.Cell. 2002; 111: 163-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) and has been previously mapped as a phosphorylation site in a mass spectrometry-based proteomic screen of mitotic spindles (Nousiainen et al., 2006Nousiainen M. Sillje H.H. Sauer G. Nigg E.A. Korner R. Phosphoproteome analysis of the human mitotic spindle.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 5391-5396Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). To test whether CENP-E T422 (424 in Xenopus laevis) is phosphorylated by Aurora kinases, we performed in vitro kinase assays using purified Aurora kinases and portions of Xenopus CENP-E as a substrate. Xenopus Aurora B, together with its activator INCENP, phosphorylated both full-length and a motor fragment of CENP-E (CENP-E1-473). However, Aurora B failed to phosphorylate CENP-E1-473 in which threonine 424 had been converted to alanine (Figure 1B). Xenopus CENP-E T424 was also readily phosphorylated by Aurora A (Figures S1A and S1B available online), confirming that the conserved threonine located close to the CENP-E motor domain is phosphorylated by both Aurora A and B in vitro. The stoichiometry of CENP-E1-473 phosphorylation by Aurora A saturated at two moles of PO4 per mole of CENP-E1-473, most likely with an additional phosphorylation site located C-terminal to T424, as a shorter CENP-E1-415 fragment was not phosphorylated by either Aurora kinase (Figure S1B). To examine the phosphorylation of CENP-E T422 in vivo, a rabbit polyclonal antibody was generated against a phosphopeptide of human CENP-E surrounding T422 (Figure S1C). The affinity purified anti-pT422 antibody recognized recombinant human CENP-E1-429 only in the presence of active kinase (Figure 1C) and recognition of phosphorylated Xenopus CENP-E1-428 by the anti-pT422 antibody was abolished by the mutation T424A (Figure S1D). The anti-pT422 antibody also recognized wild-type (WT) CENP-E immunoprecipitated from nocodazole-arrested human (DLD-1) cells, but not CENP-E containing a T422A mutation or WT CENP-E that had been incubated with λ-phosphatase (Figure 1D). Together, these results demonstrate that the anti-pT422 antibody specifically recognizes CENP-E phosphorylated at T422. To establish whether Aurora A or B phosphorylates CENP-E T422 in cells, we took advantage of the anti-pT422 antibody and a series of small molecule inhibitors that specifically inhibit either one or both of the Aurora kinases. As expected, treatment with the dual Aurora kinase inhibitor VX-680 (Harrington et al., 2004Harrington E.A. Bebbington D. Moore J. Rasmussen R.K. Ajose-Adeogun A.O. Nakayama T. Graham J.A. Demur C. Hercend T. Diu-Hercend A. et al.VX-680, a potent and selective small-molecule inhibitor of the Aurora kinases, suppresses tumor growth in vivo.Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar) abolished phosphorylation of the Aurora A substrate Transforming acidic coiled-coil 3 (p-TACC3) and the Aurora B substrate histone H3 (p-Histone H3) (Figure 1E). VX-680 treatment abolished phosphorylation of CENP-E at T422, whereas treatments with an Aurora A specific inhibitor (MLN8054) or an Aurora B specific inhibitor (ZM447439) (Ditchfield et al., 2003Ditchfield C. Johnson V.L. Tighe A. Ellston R. Haworth C. Johnson T. Mortlock A. Keen N. Taylor S.S. Aurora B couples chromosome alignment with anaphase by targeting BubR1, Mad2, and Cenp-E to kinetochores.J.

LeRoy P.J. et al.Antitumor activity of MLN8054, an orally active small-molecule inhibitor of Aurora A kinase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 4106-4111Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) resulted in only a partial reduction in T422 phosphorylation, indicating that inhibition of either Aurora kinase alone is not sufficient to eliminate the phosphorylation of CENP-E T422. However, when cells were treated with MLN8054 and ZM447439 together to inhibit both Aurora A and B, phosphorylation of T422 was completely inhibited (Figure 1E). Thus, we conclude that both Aurora A and B contribute to the phosphorylation of CENP-E at T422 in vivo. In unperturbed PtK2 cells, pT422 staining was uniformly detectable at individual kinetochores in early prometaphase, which colocalized with the centromere components recognized by autoantisera containing centromere antibodies (ACA) (Figure 1F). The kinetochore-localized pT422 signal was reduced on chromosomes congressed to the equator of the cells, but remained enriched at the kinetochores of unaligned chromosomes that are close to the spindle poles (Figure 1F). In nocodazole-treated HeLa cells, the pT422 antibody recognized a large crescent around kinetochore pairs, which colocalized with CENP-E and the outer kinetochore protein Bub1 (Figure S2A ). Kinetochore-localized pT422 disappeared following depletion of CENP-E by siRNA (Figure S2B), confirming the specificity of the pT422 staining at kinetochores. Inhibition of Aurora kinases with VX-680 sharply reduced kinetochore-localized pT422 signal (Figure 1G). When normalized to the total level of CENP-E at the kinetochore (which is also reduced in VX-680 treated cells (Ditchfield et al., 2003Ditchfield C. Johnson V.L. Tighe A. Ellston R. Haworth C. Johnson T. Mortlock A. Keen N. Taylor S.S. Aurora B couples chromosome alignment with anaphase by targeting BubR1, Mad2, and Cenp-E to kinetochores.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 267-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar)), a > 90% reduction in T422 phosphorylation was seen following VX-680 treatment (Figure 1H), demonstrating that kinetochore-localized CENP-E is a substrate for Aurora kinases in vivo. To determine if phosphorylation of T422 affects the motor properties of CENP-E, we phosphorylated T424 of Xenopus CENP-E motor (CENP-E1-473) and measured CENP-E's microtubule-stimulated ATPase activity in the presence of an increasing concentration of microtubules (Figure 2A ). The maximal ATP turnover rate (kcat) was not affected by Aurora A phosphorylation (13 ± 0.6 s-1 for CENP-E1-473, n = 3; 14 ± 1.3 s-1 for CENP-E1-473 plus Aurora A, n = 3) (Figure 2A). However, the concentration of microtubules required to reach the half maximal ATPase rate (KmMT) was increased by > 3 fold following phosphorylation (0.17 ± 0.03 μM for CENP-E1-473, n = 3; 0.64 ± 0.15 μM CENP-E1-473 plus Aurora A, n = 3) (Figure 2A). KmMT reflects CENP-E's affinity for microtubules. In the absence of microtubules, kinesins are tightly bound to ADP in solution and the rate of ADP release is extremely low (Hackney, 1988Hackney D.D. Kinesin ATPase: rate-limiting ADP release.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1988; 85: 6314-6318Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). However, binding of ADP-bound kinesin to microtubules greatly accelerates the rate of ADP release, and the kinesin proceeds to complete its enzymatic cycle. Since phosphorylation of CENP-E increased KmMT without significantly affecting kcat and the gliding speed (data not shown), it is likely that the phosphorylation of T424 reduces CENP-E's microtubule affinity primarily in its ADP bound state without affecting the rate-limiting step in CENP-E enzymatic cycle (Woehlke et al., 1997Woehlke G. Ruby A.K. Hart C.L. Ly B. Hom-Booher N. Vale R.D. Microtubule Interaction Site of the Kinesin Motor.Cell. 1997; 90: 207-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, the extent of Xenopus CENP-E1-473 binding to microtubules was determined with or without prior phosphorylation by Aurora kinase (Figure 2B). Phosphorylation of WT CENP-E1-473 by Aurora A reduced the amount of CENP-E that cosedimented with microtubules by ∼50% with a corresponding 50% increase in apparent Kd(MT) (2 μM for CENP-E1-473; 3 μM for CENP-E1-473 plus Aurora A). By contrast, Aurora A did not affect microtubule binding of T424A CENP-E1-473 (apparent Kd(MT) of 3.5 μM T424A CENP-E1-473; 3.4 μM for T424A CENP-E1-473 plus Aurora A), confirming that phosphorylation at T424 reduces the affinity of CENP-E for microtubules in the ADP state. Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy was used to determine how Aurora phosphorylation affects properties of individual CENP-E molecules. Xenopus CENP-E1-473 was tagged with the monomeric, photostable red fluorescent protein TagRFP-T (CENP-E1-473-RFP) (Shaner et al., 2008Shaner N.C. Lin M.Z. McKeown M.R. Steinbach P.A. Hazelwood K.L. Davidson M.W. Tsien R.Y. Improving the photostability of bright monomeric orange and red fluorescent proteins.Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Oregon Green 488-labeled GMPCPP microtubules were tethered to a coverslip in a flow chamber (Figure S3A ) and CENP-E1-473-RFP was added in the presence of apyrase to induce rigor binding. As expected, CENP-E1-473-RFP was stably bound in the absence of nucleotides, and fluorescence signals were photobleached in one or two steps 89% of the time (75 double steps and 68 single step; n = 160), consistent with a dimeric state for the CENP-E1-473 motor (Figure S3B). When CENP-E1-473-RFP was introduced into the flow chamber in a buffer containing ADP, both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated CENP-E1-473-RFP remained loosely bound to microtubules without displaying directional motility (Figure 2C), supporting our previous observation that CENP-E motility contains a diffusive mode that does not require ATP hydrolysis (Kim et al., 2008Kim Y. Heuser J.E. Waterman C.M. Cleveland D.W. CENP-E combines a slow, processive motor and a flexible coiled coil to produce an essential motile kinetochore tether.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Following phosphorylation, the duration of CENP-E1-473-RFP binding to microtubules was shortened by ∼30% in the presence of ADP (t = 17 ± 0.13 s for CENP-E1-473-RFP, n = 231; t = 12 ± 0.07 s for CENP-E1-473-RFP plus Aurora A, n = 240) (Figure 2D), consistent with the observation that phosphorylation of T424 reduces CENP-E's affinity to microtubules in the ADP bound state. Processivity of CENP-E in the presence of ATP was reduced after phosphorylation on T424, with run lengths of phosphorylated CENP-E1-473-RFP on individual microtubules 25% shorter than those of the unphosphorylated motor (1.6 ± 0.02 μm for CENP-E1-473-RFP, n = 337; 1.2 ± 0.02 μm for CENP-E1-473-RFP plus Aurora A, n = 294) (Figures 2E and 2F). Importantly, once reaching a microtubule end using its plus end-directed motility, individual CENP-E dimers did not immediately dissociate (Figure 2G), but remained bound there for 5.8 s (±0.8 SEM, n = 26), a feature previously observed for several other processive kinesins (Case et al., 1997Case R.B.

Here we describe major changes in the zinc physiology of the mammalian oocyte as it matures and initiates embryonic development. Single-cell elemental analysis of mouse oocytes by synchrotron-based X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM) revealed a 50% increase in total zinc content within the 12-14-h period of meiotic maturation. Perturbation of zinc homeostasis with a cell-permeable small-molecule chelator blocked meiotic progression past telophase I. Zinc supplementation rescued this phenotype when administered before this meiotic block. However, after telophase arrest, zinc triggered parthenogenesis, suggesting that exit from this meiotic step is tightly regulated by the availability of a zinc-dependent signal. These results implicate the zinc bolus acquired during meiotic maturation as an important part of the maternal legacy to the embryo."
https://openalex.org/W2018319486,"The Myc oncoprotein family comprises transcription factors that control multiple cellular functions and are widely involved in oncogenesis. Here we report the identification of Myc-nick, a cytoplasmic form of Myc generated by calpain-dependent proteolysis at lysine 298 of full-length Myc. Myc-nick retains conserved Myc box regions but lacks nuclear localization signals and the bHLHZ domain essential for heterodimerization with Max and DNA binding. Myc-nick induces alpha-tubulin acetylation and altered cell morphology by recruiting histone acetyltransferase GCN5 to microtubules. During muscle differentiation, while the levels of full-length Myc diminish, Myc-nick and acetylated alpha-tubulin levels are increased. Ectopic expression of Myc-nick accelerates myoblast fusion, triggers the expression of myogenic markers, and permits Myc-deficient fibroblasts to transdifferentiate in response to MyoD. We propose that the cleavage of Myc by calpain abrogates the transcriptional inhibition of differentiation by full-length Myc and generates Myc-nick, a driver of cytoplasmic reorganization and differentiation."

Genetic analysis in Escherichia coli identified only two genes of unknown function required for pimelate synthesis, bioC and bioH. We report in vivo and in vitro evidence that the pimeloyl moiety is synthesized by a modified fatty acid synthetic pathway in which the omega-carboxyl group of a malonyl-thioester is methylated by BioC, which allows recognition of this atypical substrate by the fatty acid synthetic enzymes.

We screened sera from 262 E. helvum using indirect fluorescent tests for antibodies against EBOV subtype Zaire. We detected a seropositive bat from Accra, Ghana, and confirmed this using western blot analysis. The bat was also seropositive for Lagos bat virus, a Lyssavirus, by virus neutralization test. The bat was fitted with a radio transmitter and was last detected in Accra 13 months after release post-sampling, demonstrating long-term survival. Antibodies to filoviruses have not been previously demonstrated in E. helvum. Radio-telemetry data demonstrates long-term survival of an individual bat following exposure to viruses of families that can be highly pathogenic to other mammal species. Because E. helvum typically lives in large urban colonies and is a source of bushmeat in some regions, further studies should determine if this species forms a reservoir for EBOV from which spillover infections into the human population may occur."

https://openalex.org/W2130939513,"In many areas, livestock are grazed within wolf (Canis lupus) range. Predation and harassment of livestock by wolves creates conflict and is a significant challenge for wolf conservation. Wild prey, such as elk (Cervus elaphus), perform anti-predator behaviors. Artificial selection of cattle (Bos taurus) might have resulted in attenuation or absence of anti-predator responses, or in erratic and inconsistent responses. Regardless, such responses might have implications on stress and fitness.We compared elk and cattle anti-predator responses to wolves in southwest Alberta, Canada within home ranges and livestock pastures, respectively. We deployed satellite- and GPS-telemetry collars on wolves, elk, and cattle (n = 16, 10 and 78, respectively) and measured seven prey response variables during periods of wolf presence and absence (speed, path sinuosity, time spent head-up, distance to neighboring animals, terrain ruggedness, slope and distance to forest). During independent periods of wolf presence (n = 72), individual elk increased path sinuosity (Z = -2.720, P = 0.007) and used more rugged terrain (Z = -2.856, P = 0.004) and steeper slopes (Z = -3.065, P = 0.002). For cattle, individual as well as group behavioral analyses were feasible and these indicated increased path sinuosity (Z = -2.720, P = 0.007) and decreased distance to neighbors (Z = -2.551, P = 0.011). In addition, cattle groups showed a number of behavioral changes concomitant to wolf visits, with variable direction in changes.Our results suggest both elk and cattle modify their behavior in relation to wolf presence, with potential energetic costs. Our study does not allow evaluating the efficacy of anti-predator behaviors, but indicates that artificial selection did not result in their absence in cattle. The costs of wolf predation on livestock are often compensated considering just the market value of the animal killed. However, society might consider refunding some additional costs (e.g., weight loss and reduced reproduction) that might be associated with the changes in cattle behaviors that we documented."

These include water (generally activated by enzyme-bound metal ions), a hydroxyl group at the 5′ or 3′ end of a DNA strand, or a hydroxyl group of an amino acid of the transposase itself, such as serine or tyrosine. Many mobile DNA elements move using a “cut-and-paste” mechanism by excision of a double-stranded copy from one genomic location and insertion at another. Recently, a family of bacterial insertion sequences (ISs), the IS200/IS605 family, has been found that uses a completely different pathway and an unusual transposase with a catalytic tyrosine (a Y1 transposase). Studies of one member, IS608 (Figure 1A ), provided a detailed picture of their transposition (Ton-Hoang et al., 2005Ton-Hoang B. Guynet C. Ronning D.R. Cointin-Marty B. Dyda F. Chandler M.

In vitro, this requires single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) substrates and is strand specific: only the “top” strand is recognized by the element-encoded transposase, TnpA, and is cleaved and transferred, whereas the “bottom” strand does not transpose. Excision of the top strand as a transposon circle with joined left and right ends is accompanied by rejoining of the DNA flanks. The circle junction then undergoes TnpA-catalyzed integration into an ssDNA target in a sequence-specific reaction. Insertion involves transfer of both the 5′ and 3′ ends of the single-strand circle junction into the ssDNA target. The left (5′) IS608 end always inserts specifically just 3′ of the tetranucleotide, 5′-TTAC-3′ (Kersulyte et al., 2002Kersulyte D. Velapatiño B. Dailide G. Mukhopadhyay A.K. Ito Y. Cahuayme L. Parkinson A.J. Gilman R.H. Berg D.E. Transposable element ISHp608 of Helicobacter pylori: nonrandom geographic distribution, functional organization, and insertion specificity.J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 992-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), which is also essential for subsequent transposition (Ton-Hoang et al., 2005Ton-Hoang B. Guynet C. Ronning D.R. Cointin-Marty B. Dyda F. Chandler M. Transposition of ISHp608, member of an unusual family of bacterial insertion sequences.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3325-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The obligatorily single-stranded nature of IS200/IS605 transposition in vitro raises the possibility that it is limited in vivo by the availability of its ssDNA substrates. A number of cellular processes generate or occur using ssDNA, including DNA repair, natural transformation, conjugative plasmid transfer, single-stranded phage infection, and replication (where the DNA serving as the template for Okazaki fragment synthesis on the lagging strand of the replication fork is single stranded). Here, we investigate the link between IS608 transposition and the availability of ssDNA during replication in vivo. Our results demonstrate that transposition of the IS200/IS605 family is closely integrated into the host cell cycle and takes advantage of the presence of ssDNA on the lagging-strand template at the replication fork for dissemination. We also show that IS608 transposition is affected by perturbing the fork: transitory inactivation of crucial replication proteins increased excision from the lagging-strand template, and stalling of the fork resulted in insertions directed to the lagging strand of the blocked fork. Our results also suggest that insertion and excision of the related element, ISDra2, also depends on the lagging-strand template in its host, the radiation-resistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans, and that this dependency can be abolished with irradiation. We have extended our analysis to a number of related IS200/IS605 elements in a variety of sequenced bacterial genomes. The results of this in silico analysis are also consistent with a strong bias of insertion into the lagging-strand template in these organisms. Together, the results demonstrate the importance of the lagging-strand template for IS608 and ISDra2 activity and suggest that all IS200/IS605 family members have evolved a mode of transposition that exploits ssDNA at the replication fork. To investigate whether replication direction affects IS608 transposition, we used a plasmid assay in E. coli to monitor the excision step of transposition (Ton-Hoang et al., 2005Ton-Hoang B. Guynet C. Ronning D.R. Cointin-Marty B. Dyda F. Chandler M. Transposition of ISHp608, member of an unusual family of bacterial insertion sequences.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3325-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this assay, the IS-carrying plasmids included an IS608 derivative in which the tnpA and tnpB genes (Figure 1A) were replaced by a chloramphenicol resistance (CmR) cassette (Figure 1C). In one case, the active (top) IS608 strand was located in the lagging-strand template (pBS102), and in the second, the replication origin was inverted (Figures 1B and 1C), placing the transposionally active top strand on the leading-strand template (pBS144). A second compatible plasmid supplied TnpA in trans under control of plac (Figure 1C). After overnight growth, IS excision was monitored by detection of reclosed donor backbone molecules from which the IS had been deleted. As shown in Figure 1C, when the IS608 active strand was located on the lagging-strand template, the donor backbone species could be clearly identified along with the parental plasmid and the plasmid used to supply transposase (lane 2). However, when the replication origin was inverted and the active IS strand was located on the leading strand, formation of the excised donor backbone species was only barely detectable (lane 3). This effect of replication direction on IS608 transposition was also observed in mating-out assays (Galas and Chandler, 1982Galas D.J. Chandler M. Structure and stability of Tn9-mediated cointegrates. Evidence for two pathways of transposition.J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 154: 245-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) that measure overall transposition frequency. We monitored transposition was monitored by following movement of IS608 from a nonmobilizable donor plasmid into a conjugative plasmid. When the IS608 active strand was on the lagging-strand template (Figure 1D, line 2), the transposition frequency was 5.6 × 10−5, but when it was on the leading-strand template, the frequency dropped 27-fold to 2.1 × 10−6 (line 3). To ensure that this was not due to possible changes in transcription resulting from the inversion introduced during cloning to switch the orientation of the replication origin (where bla was inverted together with ori), we inserted transcriptional terminators (Simons et al., 1987Simons R.W. Houman F. Kleckner N. Improved single and multicopy lac-based cloning vectors for protein and operon fusions.Gene. 1987; 53: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar) on either one (lines 4–5) or both (lines 6–7) sides of the IS608 derivatives to insulate them from impinging transcription. In these cases, the observed effect of replication direction on transposition frequency remained unchanged. Since IS608 excision is sensitive to replication direction, we asked whether it was affected by perturbation of the replication fork. We used two temperature-sensitive replication mutants: dnaG308ts, encoding a mutant DNA primase, DnaG (Wechsler and Gross, 1971Wechsler J.A. Gross J.D. Escherichia coli mutants temperature-sensitive for DNA synthesis.Mol. Gen. Genet. 1971; 113: 273-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), and dnaB8ts, encoding a mutant of the essential replication fork DNA helicase, DnaB (Carl, 1970Carl P.L. Escherichia coli mutants with temperature-sensitive synthesis of DNA.Mol. Gen. Genet. 1970; 109: 107-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Replication in these mutants occurs at 30°C but is interrupted after a shift to the restrictive temperature of 42°C. Inhibition of either DnaG or DnaB activity is expected to increase the amount of ssDNA at the fork, principally on the lagging-strand template (Louarn, 1974Louarn J.M.

Genet. 1974; 133: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, Fouser and Bird, 1983Fouser L. Bird R.E.

Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 5452-5462Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) (see also the Discussion). To test the effect of inhibition of DnaG and DnaB activities, we used a genetic screen in which a β-lactamase gene is interrupted by an IS608 derivative (pAM1, Figure S2; Experimental Procedures). TnpA-catalyzed precise excision (using TnpA provided in trans) results in reconstitution of the β-lactamase gene (Figure 2A ) and the appearance of ampicillin resistant (ApR) colonies. As shown in Figures 2Bi, 2Bii, and 2Biii for the wild-type and dnaB and dnaG mutants, respectively, after overnight growth at 30°C (a permissive temperature) without TnpA induction, the frequency of ApR colonies was low for the wild-type and mutant hosts (column a). Induction of TnpA expression resulted in a nearly 3-fold increase in excision with little difference between wild-type, dnaBts, and dnaGts strains (column b). However, when the growth protocol was modified to include a 30 min temperature shift to 42°C (and further incubation of 3 hr at 30°C to allow replication to recover), excision increased about 10- and 7-fold in the dnaB and dnaG mutants, respectively, compared to the wild-type (column d). Omission of the 42°C step resulted in indistinguishable basal levels for wild-type and mutant hosts (column c). Thus, inactivation of DnaB helicase function or inhibition of initiation of Okazaki fragment synthesis with a dnaGts mutation stimulated the excision step of transposition, consistent with the notion that ssDNA at the replication fork is a substrate for IS excision. If excision occurs at the replication fork and requires ssDNA, it seemed possible that IS length might influence excision frequency since the probability that both IS ends are within the single-stranded region of the lagging-strand template should decrease with increasing IS length. We therefore examined the effect of IS length in the excision assay by using a set of IS608 derivatives with varying spacing between the left end (LE) and right end (RE) and found that excision decreased strongly as a function of increasing IS length and that these frequencies were strongly modified in a strain carrying a dnaGts mutation. Increasing the IS length from 0.3 to 2 kb, resulted in a 7- to 10-fold decrease in excision frequency with a log-linear relationship, consistent with the notion that excision occurs more efficiently when both ends are located within the short single lagging-strand region of about 1.5–2 kb upstream of the first complete Okazaki fragment at the replication fork (see Johnson and O'Donnell, 2005Johnson A. O'Donnell M. Cellular DNA replicases: components and dynamics at the replication fork.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 283-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, for review). As the IS length was further increased, excision decreased only slightly, at least up to a transposon length of 4 kb (Figure 2C) with a possible inflection between 1.5 and 2 kb. The length of ssDNA on the lagging-strand template depends on the initiation frequency of Okazaki fragment synthesis, in turn determined by DnaG. Progressive inactivation of DnaG activity by growth of the dnaGts mutant at increasing but sublethal temperatures should reduce this frequency and increase the mean length of ssDNA at the replication fork upstream of the first complete Okazaki fragment. We therefore analyzed excision of the IS608-derived transposons in wild-type and dnaGts mutants at different temperatures (Figure 2D). While profiles were indistinguishable for the wild-type strain at 30°C and 33°C, the dnaGts mutant exhibited a generally higher excision frequency at 30°C and showed a lower length dependent slope, revealing that the replication fork is affected by the mutation even at the normal permissive temperature. However, an inflection still appeared to occur. At 33°C, excision increased significantly, particularly for the longer transposons. To further examine this, we cloned the wild-type dnaG allele downstream of the tnpAIS608 gene in the TnpA-providing plasmid so that both were under control of the same promoter (Experimental Procedures). When this plasmid, pBS179, was introduced into the dnaGts strain, it clearly suppressed the dnaGts defect at 33°C (Figure 2E). Moreover, when introduced into the wild-type dnaG strain, the excision frequencies were even further reduced and the length-dependant slope was increased (Figure 2F). The circular E. coli chromosome replicates bidirectionally from the replication origin, oriC. If IS608 insertions target the lagging-strand template, they should occur in one orientation on one side of ori and in the opposite orientation on the other. To test this, we isolated IS608 insertions in the E. coli chromosome using a temperature-sensitive plasmid as the IS donor and supplying TnpA in trans (Figure 3A ). Insertions were localized by an arbitrary PCR procedure (Experimental Procedures) followed by DNA sequencing. We observed a dramatic skew in strand specificity of IS608 insertion relative to the origin of replication, oriC. Insertions either in the left or right replicores were in the orientation expected for transposition into the lagging-strand template (Figure 3B). It is interesting to note that while insertions were distributed around the chromosome, many appeared in the vicinity of the highly transcribed rRNA genes (Table S1). We also obtained insertions into the TnpA donor plasmid in the same experiment. In contrast to the chromosome, this plasmid replicates unidirectionally and the IS608 insertion pattern was completely (Figure 3C) different. All occurred into only one strand, the lagging-strand template, a result that has strong statistical support (Figure 3 legend). In all cases, both plasmid and chromosome insertions occurred 3′ to a TTAC target, as expected. As these are distributed equally on both strands of the chromosome and the TnpA donor plasmid (data not shown), the observed strand biases for insertion cannot be explained by a bias in target sequence distribution. Since our accumulating data suggested that IS608 targets ssDNA at the replication fork, we asked whether insertion could also be observed into forks stalled at a predefined location. For this, we used the E. coli Tus/Ter system in which a Ter site, when bound by the protein Tus, strongly reduces replication fork progression through Ter in the nonpermissive orientation (Ternp) (see Bierne et al., 1994Bierne H. Ehrlich S.D. Michel B. Flanking sequences affect replication arrest at the Escherichia coli terminator TerB in vivo.J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4165-4167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but not in the opposite, permissive, orientation (Terp) (Neylon et al., 2005Neylon C. Kralicek A.V. Hill T.M. Dixon N.E. Replication termination in Escherichia coli: structure and antihelicase activity of the Tus-Ter complex.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2005; 69: 501-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The assay (Figure 4A and Figure S1) used a suicide conjugation system (Demarre et al., 2005Demarre G. Guérout A.M. Matsumoto-Mashimo C. Rowe-Magnus D.A. Marlière P. Mazel D.

Microbiol. 2005; 156: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) in which the unidirectionally replicating target plasmid was carried by a recipient strain with an inactivated chromosomal tus gene. The target plasmid carried a functional tus gene and a Ter site in either the permissive or nonpermissive orientation (Figures 4B and Extended Experimental Procedures). The plasmid-based tus gene was transitorily induced only for the duration of the experiment to avoid plasmid loss. We also inserted a stretch of DNA with several spaced copies of the TTAC target tetranucleotide on both strands upstream of the Ter sites.Figure S1Experimental Systems, Related to Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4Show full caption(A) Orientation of the IS608 derivative with respect to replication direction (Related to Figure 1): Left hand cartoon shows the configuration of pBS102 in which the IS608 derivative (with the tnpA and tnpB genes replaced by a chloramphenicol resistance gene cassette) is oriented such that the active strand is part of the lagging strand template.

The R6K replication protein, Π, is carried by the chromosome of the donor strain β2163. The recipient strain does not carry the Π gene (preventing replication of the transferred plasmid) and carries a null mutation in tus.

Selection for transfer and stable maintenance of CmR in the recipient provides a plasmid population in which pBS172/pBS173 will have received IS608 insertions which can be localized by PCR. Mapping of the IS insertion sites revealed that all occurred at TTAC sequences and were distributed over the entire length of both target plasmids, largely in an orientation expected for insertion into the lagging-strand template (Figure 4B, black arrowheads). The overall distribution was the same regardless of Ter site orientation. As for the other target plasmids used here, we confirmed that TTAC sequences were distributed roughly equally on both DNA strands (data not shown). An additional set of insertions was observed in the target plasmid carrying Ternp when compared to that with Terp (Figures 4B and 4C). To precisely map these, we used PCR analysis with primers complementary to a sequence upstream of the Ter sites and either LE (for lagging-strand insertions) or RE (for leading-strand insertions). When the target plasmid carried Ternp, amplification products from four independent experiments (Figure 4C, lanes 1–4) revealed insertions adjacent to the Ter site on the lagging-strand template (Figure 4B, filled red arrowheads; Figure 4C), although occasionally an insertion was observed on the opposite strand (lane 5). Although there was a degree of variability in the insertion distribution between experiments (compare lanes 1–4), a consistently strong signal was obtained from the TTAC site located at 63 bp from Ternp, suggesting that this is the preferred insertion site. However, insertions were also observed at the closest site, located only 26 bp from Ter (Figure 4C, lanes 1, 3, and 4). With Terp, no strong Tus-dependent insertions were observed (Figure 4D). In four independent experiments we only once isolated an insertion in this region (in the plasmid population from experiment 1, lane 1), and this had occurred into a TTAC site within the Ter sequence itself rather than immediately upstream. Thus, the lagging strand of replication forks blocked by Tus is a preferential target for IS608 insertions and these can occur in close proximity to the Tus binding site, Ter. ISDra2 is an IS200/IS605 family member from the highly radiation resistant D. radiodurans. It has a similar organization to IS608 and inserts specifically 3′ to a TTGAT pentanucleotide (Islam et al., 2003Islam S.M. Hua Y. Ohba H. Satoh K. Kikuchi M. Yanagisawa T. Narumi I.

SRF binding to the Arc promoter was required for the late phase of LTD in this system. It has been suggested that gene expression and protein synthesis are required for both long-term memory consolidation and late phases of long-term potentiation and long-term depression (LTD). The necessary genes and the specific transcription factor binding sites in their promoters remain unknown. We found that inhibition of the transcription factor SRF or its cofactor MAL blocked the late phase of LTD in mouse cultured cerebellar Purkinje cells, as did deletion of the immediate early gene Arc. Using neuronal bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transfection, we found that, in Arc−/− cells transfected with a wild-type Arc BAC, late-phase LTD was rescued. However, mutation of one SRF-binding site in the Arc promoter (SRE 6.9) blocked this rescue. Co-transfection of wild-type Arc and SRF engineered to bind mutated SRE 6.9 restored late-phase LTD in Arc−/−, SRE 6.9 mutant BAC cells. Thus, SRF binding to SRE 6.9 in the Arc promoter is required for the late phase of cerebellar LTD."
https://openalex.org/W2078016313,"The marine-biodiversity assessment of New Zealand (Aotearoa as known to Māori) is confined to the 200 nautical-mile boundary of the Exclusive Economic Zone, which, at 4.2 million km2, is one of the largest in the world. It spans 30° of latitude and includes a high diversity of seafloor relief, including a trench 10 km deep. Much of this region remains unexplored biologically, especially the 50% of the EEZ deeper than 2,000 m. Knowledge of the marine biota is based on more than 200 years of marine exploration in the region. The major oceanographic data repository is the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA), which is involved in several Census of Marine Life field projects and is the location of the Southwestern Pacific Regional OBIS Node; NIWA is also data manager and custodian for fisheries research data owned by the Ministry of Fisheries. Related data sources cover alien species, environmental measures, and historical information. Museum collections in New Zealand hold more than 800,000 registered lots representing several million specimens. During the past decade, 220 taxonomic specialists (85 marine) from 18 countries have been engaged in a project to review New Zealand's entire biodiversity. The above-mentioned marine information sources, published literature, and reports were scrutinized to give the results summarized here for the first time (current to 2010), including data on endemism and invasive species. There are 17,135 living species in the EEZ. This diversity includes 4,315 known undescribed species in collections. Species diversity for the most intensively studied phylum-level taxa (Porifera, Cnidaria, Mollusca, Brachiopoda, Bryozoa, Kinorhyncha, Echinodermata, Chordata) is more or less equivalent to that in the ERMS (European Register of Marine Species) region, which is 5.5 times larger in area than the New Zealand EEZ. The implication is that, when all other New Zealand phyla are equally well studied, total marine diversity in the EEZ may be expected to equal that in the ERMS region. This equivalence invites testable hypotheses to explain it. There are 177 naturalized alien species in New Zealand coastal waters, mostly in ports and harbours. Marine-taxonomic expertise in New Zealand covers a broad number of taxa but is, proportionately, at or near its lowest level since the Second World War. Nevertheless, collections are well supported by funding and are continually added to. Threats and protection measures concerning New Zealand's marine biodiversity are commented on, along with potential and priorities for future research."
https://openalex.org/W1969285070,"Double-strand breaks (DSBs) are serious genetic lesions that must be repaired to prevent catastrophic loss of chromosomes. In general, two classes of mechanisms exist for repairing double-strand breaks, homologous recombination (HR) or nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). HR requires an identical (or nearly identical) template strand of DNA to mend a lesion whereas NHEJ repairs a double-strand gap in DNA without a homologous template (middle upper panel).NHEJ, however, is not entirely devoid of guiding information. Short stretches of complementary “microhomology” sequences (1–10 base pairs) often appear at repair junc-tions, suggesting that limited base pairing between two ends of a double-strand break is exploited during repair. Thus, NHEJ is guided entirely by information in the lesion, which makes NHEJ error prone in comparison to HR. Nonetheless, NHEJ is optimal and necessary for double-strand break repair during the cell-cycle stages (i.e., G0 and G1) when sis-ter chromatids are not available to guide more accurate repair by HR. Most notably, NHEJ is incredibly flexible in terms of its substrates and repair mechanisms. In this SnapShot, we describe the wide range of lesions on which NHEJ operates, the diverse mechanisms used to join these breaks, and the many outcomes possible at the repaired junctions."
https://openalex.org/W2090038705,"Elevated extracellular lipids, such as the free fatty acid palmitate, can induce pancreatic beta cell endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and apoptosis, thereby contributing to the initiation and progression of type 2 diabetes. ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY), a key enzyme in cellular lipid production, was identified as a palmitate target in a proteomic screen. We investigated the effects of palmitate on ACLY activity and phosphorylation and its role in beta cell ER stress and apoptosis. We demonstrated that treatment of MIN6 cells, mouse islets and human islets with palmitate reduced ACLY protein levels. These in vitro results were validated by our finding that islets from high fat-fed mice had a significant decrease in ACLY, similar to that previously observed in type 2 diabetic human islets. Palmitate decreased intracellular acetyl-CoA levels to a similar degree as the ACLY inhibitor, SB-204990, suggesting a reduction in ACLY activity. ACLY inhibitors alone were sufficient to induce CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologues protein (CHOP)-dependent ER stress and caspase-3-dependent apoptosis. Similarly, even modest shRNA-mediated knockdown of ACLY caused a significant increase in beta cell apoptosis and ER stress. The effects of chemical ACLY inhibition and palmitate were non-additive and therefore potentially mediated by a common mechanism. Indeed, overexpression of ACLY prevented palmitate-induced beta cell death. These observations provide new evidence that ACLY expression and activity can be suppressed by exogenous lipids and demonstrate a critical role for ACLY in pancreatic beta cell survival. These findings add to the emerging body of evidence linking beta cell metabolism with programmed cell death. Elevated extracellular lipids, such as the free fatty acid palmitate, can induce pancreatic beta cell endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and apoptosis, thereby contributing to the initiation and progression of type 2 diabetes. ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY), a key enzyme in cellular lipid production, was identified as a palmitate target in a proteomic screen. We investigated the effects of palmitate on ACLY activity and phosphorylation and its role in beta cell ER stress and apoptosis. We demonstrated that treatment of MIN6 cells, mouse islets and human islets with palmitate reduced ACLY protein levels. These in vitro results were validated by our finding that islets from high fat-fed mice had a significant decrease in ACLY, similar to that previously observed in type 2 diabetic human islets. Palmitate decreased intracellular acetyl-CoA levels to a similar degree as the ACLY inhibitor, SB-204990, suggesting a reduction in ACLY activity. ACLY inhibitors alone were sufficient to induce CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologues protein (CHOP)-dependent ER stress and caspase-3-dependent apoptosis. Similarly, even modest shRNA-mediated knockdown of ACLY caused a significant increase in beta cell apoptosis and ER stress. The effects of chemical ACLY inhibition and palmitate were non-additive and therefore potentially mediated by a common mechanism. Indeed, overexpression of ACLY prevented palmitate-induced beta cell death. These observations provide new evidence that ACLY expression and activity can be suppressed by exogenous lipids and demonstrate a critical role for ACLY in pancreatic beta cell survival. These findings add to the emerging body of evidence linking beta cell metabolism with programmed cell death. IntroductionType 2 diabetes is associated with dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and defects in insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells (1Bell G.I. Polonsky K.S. Nature. 2001; 414: 788-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). It is also becoming clear that increased beta cell apoptosis is associated with diabetes in humans and animal models (2Butler A.E. Janson J. Bonner-Weir S. Ritzel R. Rizza R.A. Butler P.C. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (3223) Google Scholar, 3Kahn S.E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 4047-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 4Prentki M. Joly E.

Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8452-8457Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The events that cause diabetes remain incompletely understood, but it has been hypothesized that the elevated levels of lipids observed in obese individuals, including increased free fatty acids, might contribute to the pathophysiology of the disease (7Unger R.H. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 863-870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many studies have shown that chronic high circulating levels of fatty acids are detrimental to beta cell function and survival, both in the presence and absence of elevated glucose (6Jeffrey K.D. Alejandro E.U. Luciani D.S. Kalynyak T.B. Hu X. Li H. Lin Y. Townsend R.R. Polonsky K.S. Johnson J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8452-8457Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 8Boden G. Shulman G.I. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 32: 14-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar, 9Zhou Y.P. Grill V.E.

Diabetes. 1997; 46: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Therefore, understanding the genome- and proteome-wide changes induced by fatty acids in beta cells and the molecular mechanisms of these changes would contribute to the understanding of the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and may open avenues for the development of new therapies. Recently, we reported the effects of elevated palmitate on the beta cell proteome under substimulatory glucose concentrations (6Jeffrey K.D. Alejandro E.U. Luciani D.S. Kalynyak T.B. Hu X. Li H. Lin Y. Townsend R.R. Polonsky K.S. Johnson J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8452-8457Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Among the more interesting findings were significant changes in two gel features identified as ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) 2The abbreviations used are: ACLYATP-citrate lyaseERendoplasmic reticulumCHOPCCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologues protein. (supplemental Fig. S1) (6Jeffrey K.D. Alejandro E.U. Luciani D.S. Kalynyak T.B. Hu X. Li H. Lin Y. Townsend R.R. Polonsky K.S. Johnson J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8452-8457Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar).ACLY is a cytosolic protein that catalyzes the formation of acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate from citrate and coenzyme A in the presence of ATP. Acetyl-CoA is an essential substrate for the biosynthesis of cholesterol and long-chain fatty acids, making ACLY a critical enzyme for de novo synthesis of a wide range of complex cellular lipids (12Knowles S.E. Jarrett I.G. Filsell O.H. Ballard F.J. Biochem. J. 1974; 142: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The ACLY gene is widely expressed in many tissues, and deletion of the gene in mice leads to embryonic lethality (13Beigneux A.P. Kosinski C. Gavino B. Horton J.D. Skarnes W.C. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9557-9564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). ACLY activity is high in tissues such as fat and liver (∼1 unit/g wet weight). ACLY is also expressed and active in pancreatic beta cells (14MacDonald M.J. Smith 3rd, A.D. Hasan N.M. Sabat G. Fahien L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30596-30606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). ACLY levels and activity are significantly reduced in pancreatic islets from patients with type 2 diabetes (15MacDonald M.J. Longacre M.J. Langberg E.C. Tibell A. Kendrick M.A. Fukao T. Ostenson C.G. Diabetologia. 2009; 52: 1087-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Several groups have investigated the role of ACLY in glucose-stimulated insulin release and have obtained conflicting results (16Guay C. Madiraju S.R. Aumais A. Joly E. Prentki M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35657-35665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 17Joseph J.W. Odegaard M.L. Ronnebaum S.M. Burgess S.C. Muehlbauer J. Sherry A.D. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 31592-31600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that ACLY may promote cell proliferation or survival, especially in the context of cancer (18Bauer D.E. Hatzivassiliou G. Zhao F. Andreadis C. Thompson C.B. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 6314-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 19Hatzivassiliou G. Zhao F. Bauer D.E. Andreadis C. Shaw A.N. Dhanak D. Hingorani S.R. Tuveson D.A. Thompson C.B.

Satoh Y. Okumura S. Nakagawa K. Ishikawa Y. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 8547-8554Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Notwithstanding, it remains unclear if ACLY plays a role in beta cell survival. There is evidence from other cell types that ACLY activity can be regulated by phosphorylation via kinases, such as PKA, Akt, and GSK-3 (21Potapova I.A. El-Maghrabi M.R. Doronin S.V. Benjamin W.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1169-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 22Berwick D.C. Hers I. Heesom K.J. Moule S.K. Tavare J.M. J. Biol.

However, it is controversial whether these phosphorylation events actually alter the enzymatic activity of ACLY and the production of acetyl-CoA (25Linn T.C. Srere P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1691-1698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the relationship between ACLY phosphorylation and ACLY activity in pancreatic beta cells also remains unclear.In the present study, building upon our previous proteomic screen (6Jeffrey K.D. Alejandro E.U. Luciani D.S. Kalynyak T.B. Hu X. Li H. Lin Y. Townsend R.R. Polonsky K.S. Johnson J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8452-8457Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), we have characterized the time- and dose-dependent effects of palmitate on ACLY protein expression, activity, and phosphorylation status in the presence of basal or high concentrations of glucose. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches provide evidence that ACLY plays a critical role in the prevention of pancreatic beta cell ER stress and apoptosis.DISCUSSIONThe goal of the present study was to investigate the role of ACLY in palmitate-induced beta cell ER stress and apoptosis. Here, we present four major new findings. First, our data demonstrate that ACYL, a rate-limiting and non-redundant enzyme required for de novo lipid synthesis, is strikingly down-regulated by prolonged exposure to the free fatty acid palmitate. Second, we provide evidence that the apparent activity of ACLY is not directly correlated with the phosphorylation of at least two sites in beta cells. Third, we find that loss of ACLY is sufficient to induce beta cell ER stress and apoptosis, whereas acute inhibition of this enzyme does not impair glucose-stimulated insulin release in our hands. Finally, we demonstrate that overexpression of ACLY can reverse palmitate-induced beta cell death. Together, these investigations point to an important and novel role for ACLY in pancreatic beta cell survival.In our previous proteomic screen, it was shown that palmitate induced changes in a number of proteins in pancreatic beta cells, including ACLY (6Jeffrey K.D. Alejandro E.U. Luciani D.S. Kalynyak T.B. Hu X. Li H. Lin Y. Townsend R.R. Polonsky K.S. Johnson J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8452-8457Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In the present report, we show clearly that ACLY protein levels and activity are reduced by palmitate. MacDonald and colleagues (15MacDonald M.J. Longacre M.J. Langberg E.C. Tibell A. Kendrick M.A. Fukao T. Ostenson C.G. Diabetologia. 2009; 52: 1087-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) also reported that ACLY mRNA was reduced in islets from type 2 diabetic patients. ACLY plays an important role in de novo lipid synthesis; therefore, it has been suggested as a therapeutic target for lipid reduction in obese individuals and obesity-related diseases, such as coronary heart disease (40Gribble A.D. Ife R.J. Shaw A. McNair D. Novelli C.E. Bakewell S. Shah V.P. Dolle R.E. Groot P.H. Pearce N. Yates J. Tew D. Boyd H. Ashman S. Eggleston D.S. Haltiwanger R.C. Okafo G. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 3582-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As such, several pharmaceutical companies have invested in the development of ACLY inhibitors. Most previous studies have focused on the roles of ACLY and its blockade in cells with high lipogenic capacity, such as adipocytes (41Suzuki M. Okuda H. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. 1981; 27: 595-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) and hepatocytes (42Berkhout T.A. Havekes L.M. Pearce N.J. Groot P.H. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and consequential effects on the plasma triglyceride and lipoprotein levels (35Pearce N.J. Yates J.W. Berkhout T.A. Jackson B. Tew D. Boyd H. Camilleri P. Sweeney P. Gribble A.D. Shaw A. Groot P.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that this class of inhibitors might not be an ideal therapeutic approach for type 2 diabetes, since they induce beta cell death.ACLY is overexpressed in many tumors and immortalized cell lines (18Bauer D.E. Hatzivassiliou G. Zhao F. Andreadis C. Thompson C.B. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 6314-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 20Migita T. Narita T. Nomura K. Miyagi E. Inazuka F. Matsuura M. Ushijima M. Mashima T. Seimiya H. Satoh Y. Okumura S. Nakagawa K. Ishikawa Y. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 8547-8554Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). ACLY inhibitors have been proposed as cancer therapeutics due to their ability to prevent proliferation and stimulate apoptosis in cancer cells that display high rates of de novo lipogenesis (18Bauer D.E. Hatzivassiliou G. Zhao F. Andreadis C. Thompson C.B. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 6314-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 19Hatzivassiliou G. Zhao F. Bauer D.E. Andreadis C. Shaw A.N. Dhanak D. Hingorani S.R. Tuveson D.A. Thompson C.B. Cancer Cell. 2005; 8: 311-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Pancreatic beta cells rely critically on glycolysis for glucose sensing, and previous studies have demonstrated lipogenesis in beta cells (34Roche E. Farfari S. Witters L.A. Assimacopoulos-Jeannet F. Thumelin S. Brun T. Corkey B.E. Saha A.K. Prentki M. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1086-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). ACLY is also expressed at a high level in pancreatic beta cells and at an even higher level in the MIN6 beta cell line. In fact, our recent gene array data suggest that mRNA encoding ACLY is the most highly expressed enzyme mRNA in MIN6 cells. 3J. D. J., unpublished results. Here we demonstrate that ACLY plays a critical role in the induction of apoptosis in pancreatic beta cells exposed to palmitate. Whether other proapoptotic stimuli suppress ACLY expression remains to be fully investigated. Interestingly, one genomic screen showed that ACLY was one of the many genes down-regulated in INS-1E beta cells treated with proapoptotic cytokines for 24 h (43Kutlu B. Cardozo A.K. Darville M.I. Kruhøffer M. Magnusson N. Ørntoft T. Eizirik D.L. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2701-2719Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Thus, ACLY may be an essential factor for beta cell survival under multiple conditions. Whether ACLY plays the same role in other tissues is unclear, although it has to be suggested that the effects of ACLY on apoptosis might be tissue-specific because knockdown of ACLY in some tumor cells did not induce apoptosis (44Knowles L.M. Yang C. Osterman A. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 31378-31384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, homozygous ACLY knock-out is lethal in mice, indicating the generalized importance of this enzyme (13Beigneux A.P. Kosinski C. Gavino B. Horton J.D. Skarnes W.C. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9557-9564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).Recently, another important role for ACLY has emerged. ACLY was shown to be the major source for acetyl-CoA required for histone acetylation and the control of DNA accessibility for gene transcription (39Wellen K.E. Hatzivassiliou G. Sachdeva U.M. Bui T.V. Cross J.R. Thompson C.B. Science. 2009; 324: 1076-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar). The effects of ACLY knockdown on gene transcription were completely reversed by acetate, which provides cells with an ACLY-independent source for acetyl-CoA (39Wellen K.E. Hatzivassiliou G. Sachdeva U.M. Bui T.V. Cross J.R. Thompson C.B. Science. 2009; 324: 1076-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar). It will undoubtedly be of interest in the future to determine whether specific genes might be altered in pancreatic beta cells as a result of ACLY inhibition by palmitate. Although our data support the hypothesis that ACLY normally performs vital functions in the beta cells, results from our experiments suggested that acetate could not rescue beta cells from the deleterious effects of palmitate (supplemental Fig. S5). This suggests that palmitate-induced beta cell apoptosis is not critically dependent upon changes in acetyl-CoA availability and, by extension, upon histone acetylation, under these experimental conditions. The exact mechanisms linking ACLY to caspase-3 activation remain to be elucidated.Palmitate is known to trigger ER stress and apoptosis in beta cells, and a number of mechanisms have been proposed (6Jeffrey K.D.

Our current results suggest that ACLY is another important player in the complex network controlling ER stress and programmed cell death in response to free fatty acids. ER stress accounts for a significant proportion of palmitate-induced beta cell apoptosis, and our results suggest that the loss of ACLY can be induced by ER stress.Importantly, palmitate-induced beta cell apoptosis at basal glucose was completely reversed by ACLY overexpression, whereas there was an inability to completely rescue ER stress, apoptosis, and cell death at high glucose. We interpret these data as suggesting distinct mechanisms of cell death that differentially involve ACLY. This work adds to a growing body of evidence that suggests that the mechanisms by which palmitate induces programmed cell death in beta cells differ in low versus high glucose (6Jeffrey K.D. Alejandro E.U. Luciani D.S. Kalynyak T.B. Hu X. Li H. Lin Y. Townsend R.R. Polonsky K.S. Johnson J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The process of autophagy, which has specific energy dependence, is emerging as a modulator of programmed cell death in beta cells (54Fujimoto K. Hanson P.T. Tran H. Ford E.L. Han Z. Johnson J.D.

Cell Metab. 2008; 8: 325-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar).Whether ACLY activity plays a net positive or negative role in diabetes cannot be inferred with any certainty from the studies conducted to date. On one hand, elevated cellular lipid synthesis might be expected to have deleterious effects over the long term. For example, reducing ACLY activity in liver was recently shown to protect against hepatic steatosis (56Wang Q. Jiang L. Wang J. Li S. Yu Y. You J. Zeng R. Gao X. Rui L. Li W. Liu Y. Hepatology. 2009; 49: 1166-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). On the other hand, de novo lipid synthesis is essential for many cellular functions. In pancreatic beta cells, cellular lipids have been implicated as signals for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Some studies have shown that ACLY participates in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (16Guay C. Madiraju S.R. Aumais A. Joly E. Prentki M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35657-35665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 57Flamez D. Berger V. Kruhøffer M. Orntoft T. Pipeleers D. Schuit F.C. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2018-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), whereas others have failed to show a critical role for this enzyme (14MacDonald M.J. Smith 3rd, A.D. Hasan N.M. Sabat G. Fahien L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30596-30606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 17Joseph J.W. Odegaard M.L. Ronnebaum S.M. Burgess S.C. Muehlbauer J. Sherry A.D. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 31592-31600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). INS-1 cells with very substantial (∼90%) reduction in ACLY expression showed no change in glucose-stimulated insulin release (14MacDonald M.J. Smith 3rd, A.D. Hasan N.M. Sabat G. Fahien L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30596-30606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The reasons for the discrepancies in the literature remain unclear but may be related to differences in conditions of cell treatments, especially glucose concentrations and the availability of palmitate. In our hands, for example, using minimal Krebs solution containing 20 mm glucose, we were unable to observe effects of ACLY inhibition on mouse islets insulin secretion.In summary, our data suggest a model whereby elevated levels of circulating free fatty acids suppress ACLY activity, leading to lipotoxicity in pancreatic beta cells. Although the suppression of lipogenesis by ACLY inhibitors would be expected to reduce the toxic load on beta cells, loss of ACLY activity might also cause adverse direct effects on beta cells. Strategies designed to prevent the loss of ACLY in beta cells while retaining its function in the major sites of lipogenesis might be therapeutically useful. IntroductionType 2 diabetes is associated with dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and defects in insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells (1Bell G.I. Polonsky K.S.

The events that cause diabetes remain incompletely understood, but it has been hypothesized that the elevated levels of lipids observed in obese individuals, including increased free fatty acids, might contribute to the pathophysiology of the disease (7Unger R.H. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 863-870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many studies have shown that chronic high circulating levels of fatty acids are detrimental to beta cell function and survival, both in the presence and absence of elevated glucose (6Jeffrey K.D. Alejandro E.U. Luciani D.S. Kalynyak T.B. Hu X. Li H. Lin Y. Townsend R.R. Polonsky K.S. Johnson J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Therefore, understanding the genome- and proteome-wide changes induced by fatty acids in beta cells and the molecular mechanisms of these changes would contribute to the understanding of the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and may open avenues for the development of new therapies. Recently, we reported the effects of elevated palmitate on the beta cell proteome under substimulatory glucose concentrations (6Jeffrey K.D. Alejandro E.U. Luciani D.S. Kalynyak T.B. Hu X. Li H. Lin Y. Townsend R.R. Polonsky K.S. Johnson J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8452-8457Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Among the more interesting findings were significant changes in two gel features identified as ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) 2The abbreviations used are: ACLYATP-citrate lyaseERendoplasmic reticulumCHOPCCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologues protein. (supplemental Fig. S1) (6Jeffrey K.D. Alejandro E.U. Luciani D.S. Kalynyak T.B. Hu X. Li H. Lin Y. Townsend R.R. Polonsky K.S. Johnson J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8452-8457Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar).ACLY is a cytosolic protein that catalyzes the formation of acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate from citrate and coenzyme A in the presence of ATP. Acetyl-CoA is an essential substrate for the biosynthesis of cholesterol and long-chain fatty acids, making ACLY a critical enzyme for de novo synthesis of a wide range of complex cellular lipids (12Knowles S.E. Jarrett I.G. Filsell O.H. Ballard F.J. Biochem. J. 1974; 142: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The ACLY gene is widely expressed in many tissues, and deletion of the gene in mice leads to embryonic lethality (13Beigneux A.P. Kosinski C. Gavino B. Horton J.D. Skarnes W.C. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9557-9564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). ACLY activity is high in tissues such as fat and liver (∼1 unit/g wet weight). ACLY is also expressed and active in pancreatic beta cells (14MacDonald M.J. Smith 3rd, A.D. Hasan N.M. Sabat G. Fahien L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30596-30606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). ACLY levels and activity are significantly reduced in pancreatic islets from patients with type 2 diabetes (15MacDonald M.J. Longacre M.J. Langberg E.C. Tibell A. Kendrick M.A. Fukao T. Ostenson C.G. Diabetologia. 2009; 52: 1087-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Several groups have investigated the role of ACLY in glucose-stimulated insulin release and have obtained conflicting results (16Guay C. Madiraju S.R. Aumais A. Joly E. Prentki M. J. Biol.

It has also been proposed that ACLY may promote cell proliferation or survival, especially in the context of cancer (18Bauer D.E. Hatzivassiliou G. Zhao F. Andreadis C. Thompson C.B. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 6314-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 19Hatzivassiliou G. Zhao F. Bauer D.E. Andreadis C. Shaw A.N. Dhanak D. Hingorani S.R. Tuveson D.A. Thompson C.B.

Notwithstanding, it remains unclear if ACLY plays a role in beta cell survival. There is evidence from other cell types that ACLY activity can be regulated by phosphorylation via kinases, such as PKA, Akt, and GSK-3 (21Potapova I.A. El-Maghrabi M.R. Doronin S.V. Benjamin W.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1169-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 22Berwick D.C. Hers I. Heesom K.J. Moule S.K. Tavare J.M. J. Biol.

However, it is controversial whether these phosphorylation events actually alter the enzymatic activity of ACLY and the production of acetyl-CoA (25Linn T.C. Srere P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1691-1698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the relationship between ACLY phosphorylation and ACLY activity in pancreatic beta cells also remains unclear.In the present study, building upon our previous proteomic screen (6Jeffrey K.D. Alejandro E.U. Luciani D.S. Kalynyak T.B. Hu X. Li H. Lin Y. Townsend R.R. Polonsky K.S. Johnson J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8452-8457Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), we have characterized the time- and dose-dependent effects of palmitate on ACLY protein expression, activity, and phosphorylation status in the presence of basal or high concentrations of glucose. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches provide evidence that ACLY plays a critical role in the prevention of pancreatic beta cell ER stress and apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1971778800,"S-palmitoylation is rapidly emerging as an important post-translational mechanism to regulate ion channels. We have previously demonstrated that large conductance calcium- and voltage-activated potassium (BK) channels are palmitoylated within an alternatively spliced (STREX) insert. However, these studies also revealed that additional site(s) for palmitoylation must exist outside of the STREX insert, although the identity or the functional significance of these palmitoylated cysteine residues are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that BK channels are palmitoylated at a cluster of evolutionary conserved cysteine residues (Cys-53, Cys-54, and Cys-56) within the intracellular linker between the S0 and S1 transmembrane domains. Mutation of Cys-53, Cys-54, and Cys-56 completely abolished palmitoylation of BK channels lacking the STREX insert (ZERO variant). Palmitoylation allows the S0-S1 linker to associate with the plasma membrane but has no effect on single channel conductance or the calcium/voltage sensitivity. Rather, S0-S1 linker palmitoylation is a critical determinant of cell surface expression of BK channels, as steady state surface expression levels are reduced by ∼55% in the C53:54:56A mutant. STREX variant channels that could not be palmitoylated in the S0-S1 linker also displayed significantly reduced cell surface expression even though STREX insert palmitoylation was unaffected. Thus our work reveals the functional independence of two distinct palmitoylation-dependent membrane interaction domains within the same channel protein and demonstrates the critical role of S0-S1 linker palmitoylation in the control of BK channel cell surface expression."
https://openalex.org/W2040505489,"Clear, transparent and sufficiently detailed abstracts of randomized trials (RCTs), published in journal articles are important because readers will often base their initial assessment of a trial on such information. However, little is known about the quality of reporting in abstracts of RCTs published in medical journals in China.We identified RCTs abstracts from 5 five leading Chinese medical journals published between 1998 and 2007 and indexed in MEDLINE. We assessed the quality of reporting of these abstracts based on the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) abstract checklist. We also sought to identify whether any differences exist in reporting between the Chinese and English language version of the same abstract.We identified 332 RCT abstracts eligible for examination. Overall, the abstracts we examined reported 0-8 items as designated in the CONSORT checklist. On average, three items were reported per abstract. Details of the interventions (288/332; 87%), the number of participants randomized (216/332; 65%) and study objectives (109/332; 33%) were the top three items reported. Only two RCT abstracts reported details of trial registration, no abstracts reported the method of allocation concealment and only one mentioned specifically who was blinded. In terms of the proportion of RCT abstracts fulfilling a criterion, the absolute difference (percentage points) between the Chinese and English abstracts was 10% (ranging from 0 to 25%) on average, per item.The quality of reporting in abstracts of RCTs published in Chinese medical journals needs to be improved. We hope that the introduction and endorsement of the CONSORT for Abstracts guidelines by journals reporting RCTs will lead to improvements in the quality of reporting."
https://openalex.org/W2032413875,"Understanding the evolutionary origin and the phylogeographic patterns of asexual taxa can shed light on the origin and maintenance of sexual reproduction. We assessed the geographic origin, genetic diversity, and phylogeographic history of obligate parthenogen diploid Artemia parthenogenetica populations, a widespread halophilic crustacean.We analysed a partial sequence of the Cytochrome c Oxidase Subunit I mitochondrial gene from an extensive set of localities (including Eurasia, Africa, and Australia), and examined their phylogeographic patterns and the phylogenetic relationships of diploid A. parthenogenetica and its closest sexual relatives. Populations displayed an extremely low level of mitochondrial genetic diversity, with one widespread haplotype shared by over 79% of individuals analysed. Phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses indicated a multiple and recent evolutionary origin of diploid A. parthenogenetica, and strongly suggested that the geographic origin of parthenogenesis in Artemia was in Central Asia. Our results indicate that the maternal sexual ancestors of diploid A. parthenogenetica were an undescribed species from Kazakhstan and A. urmiana.We found evidence for multiple origin of parthenogenesis in Central Asia. Our results indicated that, shortly after its origin, diploid A. parthenogenetica populations underwent a rapid range expansion from Central Asia towards the Mediterranean region, and probably to the rest of its current geographic distribution. This contrasts with the restricted geographic distribution, strong genetic structure, and regional endemism of sexual Artemia lineages and other passively dispersed sexual continental aquatic invertebrates. We hypothesize that diploid parthenogens might have reached their current distribution in historical times, with a range expansion possibly facilitated by an increased availability of suitable habitat provided by anthropogenic activities, such as the spread of solar saltworks, aided by their natural dispersal vectors (i.e., waterbirds)."
https://openalex.org/W2013212140,"Voltage-gated ion channels sense transmembrane voltage changes via a paddle-shaped motif that includes the C-terminal part of the third transmembrane segment (S3b) and the N-terminal part of the fourth segment ((NT)S4) that harbors voltage-sensing arginines. Here, we find that residue triplets in S3b and (NT)S4 can be deleted individually, or even in some combinations, without compromising the channels' basic voltage-gating capability. Thus, a high degree of complementarity between these S3b and (NT)S4 regions is not required for basic voltage gating per se. Remarkably, the voltage-gated Shaker K(+) channel remains voltage gated after a 43 residue paddle sequence is replaced by a glycine triplet. Therefore, the paddle motif comprises a minimal core that suffices to confer voltage gating in the physiological voltage range, and a larger, modulatory part. Our study also shows that the hydrophobic residues between the voltage-sensing arginines help set the sensor's characteristic chemical equilibrium between activated and deactivated states."

Although N-glycosylation has been shown to influence Wnt signaling through its effects on Wnt ligands, it is unclear whether the Wnt/β-catenin pathway impacts protein N-glycosylation. In this study, we show that promoters of the first N-glycosylation gene, DPAGT1, from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK), and human epidermoid carcinoma (A253) cells contain the T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor (TCF/LEF) consensus sequence. Treatment of cells with a Wnt activator, lithium chloride, up-regulated DPAGT1 transcript levels that correlated with an increase in the β-catenin abundance. Furthermore, exposure of cells to a Wnt receptor ligand, Wnt3a, resulted in an increase in the DPAGT1 transcript levels that was abrogated by the Wnt inhibitor, Dickkopf-1. DNA mobility shift assays revealed specific protein complexes at the DPAGT1 TCF/LEF binding region that were competed off with antibodies to either Tcf3/4 or β-catenin. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed the presence of β-catenin at the DPAGT1 promoter in vivo. In addition, the DPAGT1 TCF/LEF sequence drove the expression of the luciferase reporter gene. Furthermore, up-regulation of DPAGT1 transcripts by Wnt3a led to altered N-glycosylation of E-cadherin. Interestingly, the DPAGT1 TCF/LEF sequence also interacted with γ-catenin, a close homologue of β-catenin, although not in a lithium chloride-dependent manner.

https://openalex.org/W2006626904,"Oral HPV infections detected six-months apart were compared to those detected bi-weekly, in an HIV-positive cohort, during the intervening months to elucidate systematic biases introduced into natural history studies by sampling interval.Fourteen consecutive oral rinse samples were collected every two weeks for six months from an HIV-positive cohort (n = 112) and evaluated for the presence of 37 HPV types. The cumulative probability of type-specific HPV detection at visits 1 through 14 was determined as a function of infection categorized at visits 1 and 14 as persistent, newly detected, cleared or absent. Transition models were used to evaluate the effect of HPV viral load (measured by RT-PCR for HPV 16, 18, 31, 33, 35) on infection persistence.The average point prevalence of oral HPV infection was similar at two-week and six-month sampling intervals (45% vs. 47%, p = 0.52), but cumulative prevalence was higher with the former (82% vs. 53%, p<0.001) as was the cumulative prevalence of type-specific infections (9.3% vs 3.8%, p<0.0001). Type-specific infections persistent under a six-month sampling interval had a high probability (0.93, 95%CI 0.83-0.98) of detection at 50% or more of the intervening visits and infections that were absent had a high probability (0.94, 95% CI 0.93-0.95) of no interval detection. The odds of detection at any visit significantly increased for each unit increase in HPV viral load at the previous visit.Six-month sampling is appropriate to model factors associated with type-specific oral HPV infection persistence but may misclassify HPV-exposed individuals as unexposed."
https://openalex.org/W2048471165,"Background Children with severe asthma have poor symptom control and elevated markers of airway oxidative and nitrosative stress. Paradoxically, they have decreased airway levels of S-nitrosothiols (SNOs), a class of endogenous airway smooth muscle relaxants. This deficiency results from increased activity of an enzyme that both reduces SNOs to ammonia and oxidizes formaldehyde to formic acid, a volatile carboxylic acid that is more easily detected in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) than SNOs. We therefore hypothesize that depletion of airway SNOs is related to asthma pathology, and breath formate concentration may be a proxy measure of SNO catabolism. Methods and Findings We collected EBC samples from children and adolescents, including 38 with severe asthma, 46 with mild-to-moderate asthma and 16 healthy adolescent controls, and the concentration of ionic constituents was quantified using ion chromatography. The concentrations of EBC components with volatile conjugates were log-normally distributed. Formate was the principal ion that displayed a significant difference between asthma status classifications. The mean EBC formate concentration was 40% higher in samples collected from all asthmatics than from healthy controls (mean = 5.7 µM, mean±standard deviation = 3.1−10.3 µM vs. 4.0, 2.8−5.8 µM, p = 0.05). EBC formate was higher in severe asthmatics than in mild-to-moderate asthmatics (6.8, 3.7−12.3 µM vs. 4.9, 2.8−8.7 µM, p = 0.012). In addition, formate concentration was negatively correlated with methacholine PC20 (r = −0.39, p = 0.002, asthmatics only), and positively correlated with the NO-derived ion nitrite (r = 0.46, p<0.0001) as well as with total serum IgE (r = 0.28, p = 0.016, asthmatics only). Furthermore, formate was not significantly correlated with other volatile organic acids nor with inhaled corticosteroid dose. Conclusions We conclude that EBC formate concentration is significantly higher in the breath of children with asthma than in those without asthma. In addition, amongst asthmatics, formate is elevated in the breath of those with severe asthma compared to those with mild-to-moderate asthma. We suggest that this difference is related to asthma pathology and may be a product of increased catabolism of endogenous S-nitrosothiols."
https://openalex.org/W1993035920,"Higher plants possess a large multigene family encoding secreted class III peroxidase (Prx) proteins. Peroxidases appear to be associated with plant disease resistance based on observations of induction during disease challenge and the presence or absence of isozymes in resistant vs susceptible varieties. Despite these associations, there is no evidence that allelic variation of peroxidases directly determines levels of disease resistance.The current study introduces a new strategy called Prx-Profiling. We showed that with this strategy a large number of peroxidase genes can be mapped on the barley genome. In order to obtain an estimate of the total number of Prx clusters we followed a re-sampling procedure, which indicated that the barley genome contains about 40 peroxidase gene clusters. We examined the association between the Prxs mapped and the QTLs for resistance of barley to homologous and heterologous rusts, and to the barley powdery mildew fungus. We report that 61% of the QTLs for partial resistance to P. hordei, 61% of the QTLs for resistance to B. graminis and 47% of the QTLs for non-host resistance to other Puccinia species co-localize with Prx based markers.We conclude that Prx-Profiling was effective in finding the genetic location of Prx genes on the barley genome. The finding that QTLs for basal resistance to rusts and powdery mildew fungi tend to co-locate with Prx clusters provides a base for exploring the functional role of Prx-related genes in determining natural differences in levels of basal resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2001384458,"Satellite RNAs (satRNAs), virus parasites, are exclusively associated with plant virus infection and have attracted much interest over the last 3 decades. Upon virus infection, virus-specific small interfering RNAs (vsiRNAs) are produced by dicer-like (DCL) endoribonucleases for anti-viral defense. The composition of vsiRNAs has been studied extensively; however, studies of satRNA-derived siRNAs (satsiRNAs) or siRNA profiles after satRNA co-infection are limited. Here, we report on the small RNA profiles associated with infection with Bamboo mosaic virus (BaMV) and its two satellite RNAs (satBaMVs) in Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis thaliana.Leaves of N. benthamiana or A. thaliana inoculated with water, BaMV alone or co-inoculated with interfering or noninterfering satBaMV were collected for RNA extraction, then large-scale Solexa sequencing. Up to about 20% of total siRNAs as BaMV-specific siRNAs were accumulated in highly susceptible N. benthamiana leaves inoculated with BaMV alone or co-inoculated with noninterfering satBaMV; however, only about 0.1% of vsiRNAs were produced in plants co-infected with interfering satBaMV. The abundant region of siRNA distribution along BaMV and satBaMV genomes differed by host but not by co-infection with satBaMV. Most of the BaMV and satBaMV siRNAs were 21 or 22 nt, of both (+) and (-) polarities; however, a higher proportion of 22-nt BaMV and satBaMV siRNAs were generated in N. benthamiana than in A. thaliana. Furthermore, the proportion of non-viral 24-nt siRNAs was greatly increased in N. benthamiana after virus infection.The overall composition of vsiRNAs and satsiRNAs in the infected plants reflect the combined action of virus, satRNA and different DCLs in host plants. Our findings suggest that the structure and/or sequence demands of various DCLs in different hosts may result in differential susceptibility to the same virus. DCL2 producing 24-nt siRNAs under biotic stresses may play a vital role in the antiviral mechanism in N. benthamiana."

Moreover, the mRNA levels of PPAR γ target genes (lipoprotein lipase (LPL), CD36, adipocyte protein (aP2), and liver X receptor α (LXR)) were down-regulated by UVA. Additionally, attempts to elucidate a possible mechanism underlying the UVA-mediated effects revealed that UVA induced migration inhibitory factor (MIF) gene expression, and this was mediated through activation of AP-1 (especially JNK and p42/44 MAPK) and nuclear factor-κB. In addition, reduced adipogenesis by UVA was recovered upon the treatment with anti-MIF antibodies. AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylation and up-regulation of Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) were induced by UVA.

Adipose tissue biology studies have led to improved understanding of the mechanisms that link obesity to metabolic syndrome and other complications. In addition, recent advances in adipocyte biology have established that adipose tissue serves as a means of energy storage in the form of triglycerides as well as exerts secretory/endocrine gland functions, producing various secretory molecules such as hormones and cytokines (2Kahn B.B.

In view of the preventive and therapeutic aspects of the diseases mentioned above, most intensive clinical interventions have primarily been directed at decreasing excessive amounts of adipose tissue by changing the balance between intake and the expenditure of energy (3Yamauchi T.

Adipocytes are the major cellular component in adipose tissue, and their excessive growth, differentiation, and hypertrophy are fundamental processes involved in obesity.

Rev. 1998; 78: 783-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1873) Google Scholar). Therefore, from a pathophysiological point of view, both the proliferation and differentiation of preadipocytes into mature adipocytes remain important issues. Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation is a major environmental factor responsible for a high incidence of skin aging, which is referred to as photoaging, as well as skin cancer and melanoma. UVA (320–380 nm) irradiation represents 90% of the solar UV light that reaches the surface of the earth; therefore, its contribution to human life may be significant. The UVA component of sunlight has oxidizing properties that may be deleterious to skin cells and tissue but that can also lead to strong up-regulation of the heme-catabolizing enzyme, heme oxygenase-1. This enzyme has well established antioxidant actions in cells as well as anti-inflammatory properties in mammals. There is also evidence from rodent models that this enzyme is responsible for the UVA-mediated protection against UVB-induced immunosuppression that occurs in skin. The relevance of these findings to the acute and chronic effects of sunlight, including skin carcinogenesis, is currently under investigation as are the potential implications for sunlight protection in humans (7Halliday G.M. Rana S. Photochem. Photobiol. 2008; 84: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 8Tyrrell R.M. Reeve V.E. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2006; 92: 86-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).

Commun. 1995; 207: 877-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) can respond to UVA irradiation. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have been conducted to evaluate the direct effects of UVA irradiation on adipocyte differentiation. Here, we demonstrate that UVA irradiation inhibited the differentiation of human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs) into adipocytes. This effect was mostly due to the reduced expression of PPAR γ, an adipocyte-specific nuclear hormone receptor/adipogenic transcription factor (16Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3133) Google Scholar). This reduced expression was mediated by the activation of migration inhibitory factor (MIF)-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-Kruppel-like factor (KLF) 2 signaling. The modulation of adipocyte differentiation in response to UVA irradiation might provide further insight into the physiological significance of the local application of UVA irradiation to adipose tissues with respect to the inhibition and renewal of adipocytes. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum (FBS), anti-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ2 (PPAR γ2 (N-19)), and anti-MIF were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody, isobutylmethylxanthine, dexamethasone, and insulin were purchased from Sigma. TRIzol reagent, random primers, and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase were obtained from Invitrogen. AMPK inhibitor (compound C) was purchased from Calbiochem. Anti-phospho-AMPKα antibody (Thr-172) and anti-AMPKα antibody were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were seeded in 6-cm diameter dishes at a density of 15 × 104 cells/well. Cells were grown in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped FBS at 37 °C under 5% CO2. To induce differentiation, 2-day post-confluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (day 0) were incubated for 3 days with differentiation medium (0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, 0.25 μm dexamethasone, and 1 μg/ml insulin in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped FBS). The preadipocytes were then maintained in and re-fed every 3 days with maintenance medium (phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped FBS and 1 μg/ml insulin). To examine the effects of UVA irradiation on adipocyte differentiation, 2-day post-confluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were irradiated with the indicated doses of UVA and then stimulated with differentiation medium for 3 days. The medium was then replaced with maintenance media every 3 days until the end of the experiment on day 9. hAMSCs (Invitrogen) were seeded in 6-cm diameter dishes at a density of 15 × 104 cells/well. Cells were grown in MesenPro RSTM media (Invitrogen) at 37 °C under 5% CO2. To induce differentiation, 2-day post-confluent hAMSCs (day 0) were incubated for 14 days with STEM PRO® adipocyte differentiation media (Invitrogen). To examine the effects of UVA irradiation on adipocyte differentiation of hAMSCs, 2-day post-confluent hAMSCs were irradiated with the indicated doses of UVA and then stimulated with STEM PRO® adipocyte differentiation media (Invitrogen) or STEM PRO® osteogenesis differentiation media (Invitrogen) for 3 days. The medium was then replaced with STEM PRO® adipocyte differentiation media (Invitrogen) or STEM PRO® osteogenesis differentiation media (Invitrogen) every 3 days until the end of the experiment on day 14. For UVA exposure, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed with PBS and gently overlaid with PBS. The cells were then irradiated with various fluencies. UVA irradiation was conducted in DMEM devoid of phenol red with a Vilber-Lourmat UVA table centered on 365 nm (TF-20L) with a dose rate of 3 milliwatt/cm2. A piece of glass with a thickness of 4 mm was placed above the table to absorb residual UVB radiation. 3T3-L1 adipocytes or hAMSCs that were treated as described above were washed with PBS and then fixed with 10% formalin for 30 min. Next, the cells were washed twice with distilled water, after which they were stained for at least 1 h at room temperature in freshly diluted Oil Red O solution (6 parts Oil Red O stock solution and 4 parts H2O; Oil Red O stock solution is 0.5% Oil Red O in isopropyl alcohol). The results were confirmed by three independent experiments. hAMSCs that were treated as described above were washed with PBS and then harvested into 25 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA. The samples were then sonicated three times for 15 s each using UP50H with MS7 (Hielscher Ultrasonics GmbH, Germany) to homogenize the cell suspension, after which the total triglyceride content was evaluated using a triglyceride assay kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). The protein content of an aliquot of the homogenate was also determined using a protein assay kit (Pierce). The results were confirmed by three independent experiments. hAMSCs that were treated as described above were washed twice with PBS and then harvested into 25 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm DTT. The cells were then disrupted by sonication, after which they were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Next, the supernatants were assayed for GPDH activity using GPDH activity assay kits (Takara Bio Inc., Japan) following the method described by Kozak and Jensen (17Kozak L.P. Jensen J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7775-7781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results were confirmed by four independent experiments. The general viability of cultured cells that were treated as described above was determined by the reduction of WST-8 (2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, monosodium salt) (Dojindo Laboratories, Japan) to a highly water-soluble formazan dye (18Lee J. Jung E. Lee J. Huh S. Boo Y.C. Hyun C.G. Kim Y.S. Park D. Br. J. Dermatol. 2007; 157: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This assay was performed following the incubation of hAMSCs or 3T3-L1 cells under the conditions described above. Next, 10 μl of WST-8 solution was added to each well, after which the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a spectrophotometer (PowerWave, BioTek Inc., Winooski, VT). The results were confirmed by four independent experiments. The cell-damaging effects of UVA irradiation were determined using a DNA Damage ELISA kit (Assay Designs, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI). This kit detects 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine, which is a by-product of DNA damage. The assay was conducted after incubation of hAMSCs or 3T3-L1 cells under the conditions described above. The cell lysates were added to 96-well plates, and then diluted biotinylated hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine was added to each sample well. Next, the samples were incubated at room temperature for 1 h, after which the sample wells were washed. Streptavidin-HRP was then distributed to the sample wells and the plate was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were then washed and 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate solution was added. Finally, the samples were incubated in the dark, after which the absorbance was read at 450 nm according to the manufacturer's instructions. To detect apoptotic cells, cells were stained by DNA binding with Hoechst 33342 (Sigma). This assay was conducted after the incubation of hAMSCs or 3T3-L1 cells under the conditions described above. The cells were then fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min at 4 °C, after which they were washed with PBS. To stain the nuclei, the cells were incubated for 20 min with 20 μg/ml Hoechst 33342. After washing with PBS, the cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axiophot 2, Carl Zeiss, Germany). Cells exhibiting condensed chromatin and fragmented nuclei were scored as apoptotic cells. A minimum of 500 cells were scored from each sample. Total cellular RNA was extracted from the hAMSCs 1, 7, or 14 days after inducing differentiation with TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA in a 20-μl reaction mix using random primers and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. Real time RT-PCR analysis was performed with an ABI7900HT machine (Applied Biosystems). All TaqMan RT-PCR reagents, including primers and probes, were purchased from Applied Biosystems. TaqMan analysis was performed with predesigned and optimized Assays on Demand (Applied Biosystems). The following assays were used: CD36 (Hs00169627_m1), PPAR γ (Hs01115729_m1), C/EBP α (Hs00269972_s1), C/EBP β (Hs00942496_s1), C/EBP δ (Hs00997180_s1), LPL (Hs00173425_m1), aP2 (Hs02559763_s1), KLF2 (Hs00360439_g1), 18 S ribosomal RNA (Hs99999901_s1), LXR α (Hs00172885_m1). The reaction parameters were as follows: 2 min 50 °C hold, 30 min 60 °C hold, and 5 min 95 °C hold, followed by 45 cycles of 20 s 94 °C melting and 1 min 60 °C annealing/extension. All measurements were performed in duplicate or triplicate, and the results were analyzed using the ABI sequence detector software version 2.0 (Applied Biosystems). Relative quantitation was performed as described earlier (34Langmann T. Mauerer R. Zahn A. Moehle C. Probst M. Stremmel W. Schmitz G. Clin. Chem. 2003; 49: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), and 18 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) was used as a reference gene. Because all assays used were optimized for PCR efficiency by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems), mRNA expression levels were estimated by the ΔCt values. PPRE×3 luciferase reporter was provided by Dr. A. Fukuhara (Osaka, Japan). Renilla luciferase expression vector driven by a thymidine kinase promoter was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). To assay for PPRE promoter activities, hAMSCs were transfected with PPRE luciferase reporter along with 1 μg of Renilla luciferase expression vector driven by a thymidine kinase promoter (Promega, Madison, WI) (internal standard) using Superfect transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Four hours later, the cells were incubated with DMEM in the presence or absence of the indicated doses of UVA irradiation for 20 h, after which the luciferase activities were assayed using a luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). The cells were then harvested, lysed, and centrifuged. Next, the supernatants were assayed for luciferase activity using a Dual-Luciferase assay system (Promega, WI) and an LB953 luminometer (Berthold, Germany), after which the activity was expressed as a ratio of the PPRE-1-dependent firefly luciferase activity to the control thymidine kinase Renilla luciferase activity (% control). Results were confirmed by eight independent transfections. Two-day post-confluent hAMSCs were irradiated with the indicated doses of UVA and then stimulated with STEM PRO® adipocyte differentiation media (Invitrogen) for 3 days. The medium was then replaced with STEM PRO® adipocyte differentiation media (Invitrogen) every 3 days until the end of the experiment on day 14. On day 14, the cells were washed twice with cold PBS, after which they were lysed in 150 μl of sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 4% SDS, 1% bromphenol blue, 10% β-mercaptoethanol). Next, the samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P PVDF membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membranes were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-PPAR γ 2 (N-19) antibody, anti-phospho-AMPKα antibody (Thr-172), anti-AMPK α antibody, and anti-β-actin antibody. The membranes were then washed three times with Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20 (Sigma) (TBST), probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and developed using an ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). The concentrations of TNF-α, IL-1β, TGF-β1, VEGF, or MIF in the culture supernatant were measured using ELISA kits (Genzyme, Minneapolis, MN). Culture supernatants were added to 96-well plates, and diluted biotinylated TNF-α, IL-1β, TGF-β1, VEGF, or MIF was then added to the sample wells. Next, the samples were incubated at room temperature for 3 h, after which the sample wells were washed. Streptavidin-HRP was distributed to the sample wells, and the plate was then incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The wells were then washed, and 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate solution was added. Finally, the samples were incubated in the dark, after which the absorbance was read at 450 nm for 12–15 min according to the manufacturer's instructions. AMPK activity was determined using the SAMS peptide assay as described previously (19Davies S.P. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins were extracted using appropriate lysis buffer, and the protein content was determined using bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). For measurement of isoform-specific AMPK activity, 20 μg of tissue lysates were immunoprecipitated by incubation with specific antibodies against the α1-AMPK catalytic subunits (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) and 15 μl of 25% (w/v) protein G/A-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were incubated in kinase assay buffer (62.5 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 62.5 mm NaCl, 62.5 mm NaF, 6.25 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1.25 mm EDTA, 1.25 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 200 μm AMP, ATP mixture (200 μm ATP and 1.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP), with or without 200 μm SAMS peptide (HMRSAMSGLHLVKRR) at 30 °C for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by spotting the reaction mixture on phosphocellulose paper, and the paper was extensively washed with 150 mm phosphoric acid. The radioactivity was measured using a scintillation counter. ATP contents were determined by the luciferin-luciferase method using an ENLITEN ATP assay system bioluminescence detection kit (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cultured cells were rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4), incubated in cold somatic cell ATP releasing reagent for 5 min on ice, harvested with a cell scraper, and then lysated. A 10-μl aliquot was added to the luciferase ATP assay mixture, and the initial light emission was determined with a luminometer. Data were compared with ATP standards to calculate the total ATP content of each sample. The result was normalized to the protein content of the cell lysate determined using the bicinchoninic acid method. siRNAs against AMPKa1 (5′-UGCCUACCAUCUCAUAAUAdTdT),and nontargeting scrambled siRNAs were synthesized by Sigma-Proligo. Cells were then transfected with the indicated siRNAs at 50 nm during 48 h using DharmaFECT transfection agent (Dharmacon Research) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Alkaline phosphatase staining was conducted using a StemTAGTM alkaline phosphatase staining kit (Cell Biolabs, Inc., San Diego). Briefly, hAMSCs that were treated as described above were washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and then fixed with fixing solution for 2 min. Next, the cells were washed twice with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, after which they were stained for 15–30 min at room temperature in freshly prepared StemTAGTM solution. The results were confirmed by three independent experiments. hAMSCs were treated as described above, and the alkaline phosphatase activity was evaluated as a marker for preosteoblasts. Alkaline phosphatase activity was measured in cell lysates, using a colorimetric assay (Sigma) and normalized to the level of total cellular protein (Pierce). The results were confirmed by four independent experiments. All data are expressed as the means ± S.D. Differences between the control and the treated group were evaluated by a Student's t test using the Statview software (Abacus Concepts, Cary, NC). For all analyses, a p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Two-day post-confluent hAMSCs (day 0) were treated with the indicated doses of UVA irradiation and then stimulated with adipocyte differentiation media for 3 days. The medium was then replaced with adipocyte differentiation media every 3 days until the end of the experiment at day 14. After the preadipocytes differentiated into adipocytes, morphological alterations were observed due to the accumulation of lipid droplets in the cytoplasm. Specifically, Oil Red O staining revealed that the lipid accumulation in UVA-irradiated cells was significantly lower than in control cells (Fig. 1A). To further characterize the effects of UVA irradiation on differentiation, the cellular triglyceride content and GPDH enzyme activity were measured. UVA irradiation inhibited triglyceride accumulation on day 21 after full differentiation had occurred (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1B). Consistent with the observed reduction in triglyceride accumulation, GPDH activity was also reduced by UVA irradiation (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1C). The aforementioned results demonstrated that UVA irradiation inhibits adipogenesis in hAMSCs. To further investigate the role of UVA, we studied its effects on the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into adipocytes. Two-day post-confluent 3T3-L1 cells (day 0) were treated with the indicated doses of UVA irradiation every 3 days for 9 days. Similar to the results observed in the hAMSCs, Oil Red O staining revealed that the level of lipid accumulation in UVA-irradiated cells was significantly lower than the level of lipid accumulation in the control cells (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these results suggest that UVA irradiation exerts an anti-adipogenic effect on hAMSCs and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. To exclude the possibility that these effects of UVA irradiation are simply a consequence of UVA cytotoxicity, cell viability, DNA damage, and apoptosis assays were conducted. As shown in Fig. 1, the tested doses of UVA irradiation induced no cytotoxic, DNA-damaging, or apoptotic effects in hAMSCs or 3T3-L1 cells. As mentioned previously, we found that UVA irradiation has anti-adipogenesis activity. At the molecular level, adipogenesis is driven by a complex transcriptional cascade that involves the sequential activation of C/EBPs and PPAR γ (1Alessi M.C. Lijnen H.R. Bastelica D. Juhan-Vague I. Pathophysiol. Haemost. Thromb. 2003; 33: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), which are rapidly and transiently expressed after the hormonal induction of differentiation. These factors act synergistically to induce the expression of C/EBP α and PPAR γ, the master adipogenic transcription regulators, which in turn promote terminal differentiation by activating the transcription of genes involved in the creation and maintenance of the adipocyte phenotype. Loss-of-function studies have shown that PPAR γ is necessary as well as sufficient to promote adipogenesis and that C/EBP α is influential in the maintenance of the expression of PPAR γ. Therefore, we examined its effect on the expression of adipokines, including PPAR γ. As a first step to accomplish this, the effects of UVA irradiation on the expression and transactivation of PPAR γ, one of major adipogenic transcription factors, were investigated. As shown in Fig. 2A, the mRNA level of PPAR γ was significantly lower in cells that were treated with UVA irradiation during adipocyte differentiation than in the control cells. These results were confirmed by Western blot analysis for PPAR γ, which revealed that UVA irradiation inhibited PPAR γ2 protein expression in a concentration-dependent manner at day 14 of differentiation (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, we evaluated UVA irradiation to determine whether it had an effect on the transactivation activity of PPAR γ in mature adipocytes. However, as shown in Fig. 2C, cotransfection assays in 3T3-L1 cells that used PPAR γ cDNA and PPRE×3-Luc reporter revealed that UVA irradiation did not induce an inhibitory effect on PPAR γ-mediated transactivation. These results suggest that UVA inhibits adipogenesis through the down-regulation of PPAR γ expression. Taken together, these findings indicate that PPAR γ is involved in the anti-adipogenesis effect of UVA irradiation. The mRNA levels of C/EBPα were also significantly lower in cells that were irradiated with UVA during adipocyte differentiation when compared with the control cells (Fig. 2D). However, the mRNA levels of C/EBP β and δ, the upstream regulators of PPAR γ and C/EBP α, were not reduced by UVA irradiation (Fig. 2E). Activation of PPAR γ induces the expression of genes that control adipocyte fatty acid metabolism, including lipoprotein lipase, fatty acid translocase (CD36), and liver X receptor α (LXR α). In this study, we demonstrated that UVA irradiation reduces the expression of PPAR γ target genes during adipogenesis. Therefore, we evaluated this down-regulation to determine whether it was related to the observed decrease in the level of PPAR γ mRNA. We found that the mRNA levels of aP2, LPL, CD36, and LXR α were significantly lower during adipocyte differentiation following UVA irradiation (Fig. 2, F and G). Collectively, these results indicate that PPAR γ expression plays an important role in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation by UVA irradiation. Several molecular targets for anti-adipogenesis have been reported, namel"
https://openalex.org/W2093418902,"Background Phosphatidic acid (PA) is a key regulated intermediate and precursor for de novo biosynthesis of all glycerophospholipids. PA can be synthesized through the acylation of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) by 1-acyl-3-phosphate acyltransferase (also called lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase, LPAAT). Recent findings have substantiated the essential roles of acyltransferases in various biological functions. Methodologies/Principal Findings We used a flow-injection-based lipidomic approach with ∼200 multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) transitions to pre-screen fatty acyl composition of phospholipids in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants. Dramatic changes were observed in fatty acyl composition in some yeast mutants including Slc1p, a well-characterized LPAAT, and Cst26p, a recently characterized phosphatidylinositol stearoyl incorporating 1 protein and putative LPAAT in S. cerevisiae. A comprehensive high-performance liquid chromatography–based multi-stage MRM approach (more than 500 MRM transitions) was developed and further applied to quantify individual phospholipids in both strains to confirm these changes. Our data suggest potential fatty acyl substrates as well as fatty acyls that compensate for defects in both Cst26p and Slc1p mutants. These results were consistent with those from a non-radioactive LPAAT enzymatic assay using C17-LPA and acyl-CoA donors as substrates. Conclusions We found that Slc1p utilized fatty acid (FA) 18:1 and FA 14:0 as substrates to synthesize corresponding PAs; moreover, it was probably the only acyltransferase responsible for acylation of saturated short-chain fatty acyls (12:0 and 10:0) in S. cerevisiae. We also identified FA 18:0, FA 16:0, FA 14:0 and exogenous FA 17:0 as preferred substrates for Cst26p because transformation with a GFP-tagged CST26 restored the phospholipid profile of a CST26 mutant. Our current findings expand the enzymes and existing scope of acyl-CoA donors for glycerophospholipid biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2083917775,"Proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) generates large soluble APP derivatives, β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides, and APP intracellular domain. Expression of the extracellular sequences of APP or its Caenorhabditis elegans counterpart has been shown to be sufficient in partially rescuing the CNS phenotypes of the APP-deficient mice and the lethality of the apl-1 null C. elegans, respectively, leaving open the question as what is the role of the highly conserved APP intracellular domain? To address this question, we created an APP knock-in allele in which the mouse Aβ sequence was replaced by the human Aβ. A frameshift mutation was introduced that replaced the last 39 residues of the APP sequence. We demonstrate that the C-terminal mutation does not overtly affect APP processing and amyloid pathology. In contrast, crossing the mutant allele with APP-like protein 2 (APLP2)-null mice results in similar neuromuscular synapse defects and early postnatal lethality as compared with mice doubly deficient in APP and APLP2, demonstrating an indispensable role of the APP C-terminal domain in these development activities. Our results establish an essential function of the conserved APP intracellular domain in developmental regulation, and this activity can be genetically uncoupled from APP processing and Aβ pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2007526948,"During the development of sensory systems, receptive fields are modified by stimuli in the environment. This is thought to rely on learning algorithms that are sensitive to correlations in spike timing between cells, but the manner in which developing circuits selectively exploit correlations that are related to sensory inputs is unknown. We recorded from neurons in the developing optic tectum of Xenopus laevis and found that repeated presentation of moving visual stimuli induced receptive field changes that reflected the properties of the stimuli and that this form of learning was disrupted when GABAergic transmission was blocked. Consistent with a role for spike timing–dependent mechanisms, GABA blockade altered spike-timing patterns in the tectum and increased correlations between cells that would affect plasticity at intratectal synapses. This is a previously unknown role for GABAergic signals in development and highlights the importance of regulating the statistics of spiking activity for learning."
https://openalex.org/W2106572256,"Background Quantifying changes in forest bird diversity is an essential task for developing effective conservation actions. When subtle changes in diversity accumulate over time, annual comparisons may offer an incomplete perspective of changes in diversity. In this case, progressive change, the comparison of changes in diversity from a baseline condition, may offer greater insight because changes in diversity are assessed over longer periods of times. Our objectives were to determine how forest bird diversity has changed over time and whether those changes were associated with forest disturbance. Methodology/Principal Findings We used North American Breeding Bird Survey data, a time series of Landsat images classified with respect to land cover change, and mixed-effects models to associate changes in forest bird community structure with forest disturbance, latitude, and longitude in the conterminous United States for the years 1985 to 2006. We document a significant divergence from the baseline structure for all birds of similar migratory habit and nest location, and all forest birds as a group from 1985 to 2006. Unexpectedly, decreases in progressive similarity resulted from small changes in richness (<1 species per route for the 22-year study period) and modest losses in abundance (−28.7–−10.2 individuals per route) that varied by migratory habit and nest location. Forest disturbance increased progressive similarity for Neotropical migrants, permanent residents, ground nesting, and cavity nesting species. We also documented highest progressive similarity in the eastern United States. Conclusions/Significance Contemporary forest bird community structure is changing rapidly over a relatively short period of time (e.g., ∼22 years). Forest disturbance and forest regeneration are primary factors associated with contemporary forest bird community structure, longitude and latitude are secondary factors, and forest loss is a tertiary factor. Importantly, these findings suggest some regions of the United States may already fall below the habitat amount threshold where fragmentation effects become important predictors of forest bird community structure."
https://openalex.org/W1998000452,"The primary visual cortex of mammals is characterised by a retinotopic representation of the visual field. It has therefore been speculated that the visual wulst, the avian homologue of the visual cortex, also contains such a retinotopic map. We examined this for the first time by optical imaging of intrinsic signals in zebra finches, a small songbird with laterally placed eyes. In addition to the visual wulst, we visualised the retinotopic map of the optic tectum which is homologue to the superior colliculus in mammals.For the optic tectum, our results confirmed previous accounts of topography based on anatomical studies and conventional electrophysiology. Within the visual wulst, the retinotopy revealed by our experiments has not been illustrated convincingly before. The frontal part of the visual field (0 degrees +/-30 degrees azimuth) was not represented in the retinotopic map. The visual field from 30 degrees -60 degrees azimuth showed stronger magnification compared with more lateral regions. Only stimuli within elevations between about 20 degrees and 40 degrees above the horizon elicited neuronal activation. Activation from other elevations was masked by activation of the preferred region. Most interestingly, we observed more than one retinotopic representation of visual space within the visual wulst, which indicates that the avian wulst, like the visual cortex in mammals, may show some compartmentation parallel to the surface in addition to its layered structure.Our results show the applicability of the optical imaging method also for small songbirds. We obtained a more detailed picture of retinotopic maps in birds, especially on the functional neuronal organisation of the visual wulst. Our findings support the notion of homology of visual wulst and visual cortex by showing that there is a functional correspondence between the two areas but also raise questions based on considerable differences between avian and mammalian retinotopic representations."
https://openalex.org/W2035148757,"The recent advent of high-throughput SNP genotyping technologies has opened new avenues of research for population genetics. In particular, a growing interest in the identification of footprints of selection, based on genome scans for adaptive differentiation, has emerged.The purpose of this study is to develop an efficient model-based approach to perform bayesian exploratory analyses for adaptive differentiation in very large SNP data sets. The basic idea is to start with a very simple model for neutral loci that is easy to implement under a bayesian framework and to identify selected loci as outliers via Posterior Predictive P-values (PPP-values). Applications of this strategy are considered using two different statistical models. The first one was initially interpreted in the context of populations evolving respectively under pure genetic drift from a common ancestral population while the second one relies on populations under migration-drift equilibrium. Robustness and power of the two resulting bayesian model-based approaches to detect SNP under selection are further evaluated through extensive simulations. An application to a cattle data set is also provided.The procedure described turns out to be much faster than former bayesian approaches and also reasonably efficient especially to detect loci under positive selection."

Several hERG1 isoforms with different N- and C-terminal ends have been identified. The hERG1a, hERG1b, and hERG1-3.1 isoforms contain the full-length C terminus, whereas the hERG1USO isoforms, hERG1aUSO and hERG1bUSO, lack most of the C-terminal domain and contain a unique C-terminal end. The mechanisms underlying the generation of hERG1USO isoforms are not understood. We show that hERG1 isoforms with different C-terminal ends are generated by alternative splicing and polyadenylation of hERG1 pre-mRNA. We identified an intrinsically weak, noncanonical poly(A) signal, AGUAAA, within intron 9 of hERG1 that modulates the expression of hERG1a and hERG1aUSO. Replacing AGUAAA with the strong, canonical poly(A) signal AAUAAA resulted in the predominant production of hERG1aUSO and a marked decrease in hERG1 current. In contrast, eliminating the intron 9 poly(A) signal or increasing the strength of 5′ splice site led to the predominant production of hERG1a and a significant increase in hERG1 current. We found significant variation in the relative abundance of hERG1 C-terminal isoforms in different human tissues. Taken together, these findings suggest that post-transcriptional regulation of hERG1 pre-mRNA may represent a novel mechanism to modulate the expression and function of hERG1 channels.

Recently, it was suggested that native ventricular IKr channels are heterotetramers containing hERG1a and hERG1b subunits (14Jones E.M. Roti Roti E.C. Wang J. Delfosse S.A. Robertson G.A. J. Biol.

However, when expressed in mammalian Ltk− or HEK293 cells, hERG1aUSO and hERG1bUSO fail to form functional channels (10Kupershmidt S. Snyders D.J. Raes A. Roden D.M. J. Biol.

When an excess of hERG1aUSO or hERG1bUSO is coexpressed with hERG1a or hERG1b, a decrease in hERG1 current is observed (10Kupershmidt S. Snyders D.J. Raes A. Roden D.M. J. Biol.

Wymore R.S. Wanke E. Arcangeli A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 5043-5060Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies have shown that hERG1USO-containing heterotetrameric channels are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (11Guasti L. Crociani O. Redaelli E. Pillozzi S. Polvani S. Masselli M. Mello T. Galli A. Amedei A. Wymore R.S. Wanke E. Arcangeli A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 5043-5060Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Specific knockdown of hERG1USO isoforms by RNA interference increases the functional expression of hERG1a/b channels. These previous studies suggest that the function and trafficking of hERG1USO isoforms are significantly impaired in comparison to hERG1FL isoforms and that hERG1USO isoforms may post-translationally suppress hERG1a/b channel function (11Guasti L. Crociani O. Redaelli E. Pillozzi S. Polvani S. Masselli M. Mello T. Galli A. Amedei A. Wymore R.S. Wanke E. Arcangeli A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 5043-5060Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Therefore, regulation of hERG1 C-terminal isoform expression has significant functional consequences. In the present study, we show that the generation of hERG1a and hERG1aUSO isoforms results from the alternative splicing and polyadenylation of hERG1 pre-mRNA. The strengths of the 5′ splice site and poly(A) signal of intron 9 play an important role in determining the relative expression of hERG1a and hERG1aUSO and thus, regulating hERG1 channel function. The alternative processing of hERG1 pre-mRNA may represent a novel post-transcriptional mechanism to modulate the expression and function of hERG1 channels. RACE-PAT assay was performed as described (16Sallés F.J. Strickland S. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 118: 441-448PubMed Google Scholar). Human heart mRNA was purchased from Clontech. First-strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription with an oligo(dT) primer linked to a C/G-rich anchor sequence (5′-CGAGCTCCGCGGCCGCG(T)12-3′). Subsequent PCR amplification was performed using a reverse primer with only the anchor sequence without oligo(dT) (R2, 5′-GCGAGCTCCGCGGCCGCG-3′) and the hERG1USO specific forward primer (F1, 5′-GCAGATATAGCAAGCTCTTTCGACCATAG-3′). The control PCR was carried out using the F1 primer and a reverse primer upstream and adjacent to the intron 9 poly(A) signal (R1, 5′-GAAAGAACATACAGTAGTATAGCTTAG-3′). The PCR products were visualized on a polyacrylamide gel stained with ethidium bromide. The poly(A) reporter construct was generated by introducing tandem poly(A) sites into a modified pGL3 vector (Promega, Madison, WI), in which the synthetic poly(A) signal upstream of the SV40 promoter was removed. The construct contained the SV40 promoter, the firefly luciferase gene, and 308 bp of the hERG1 intron 9 followed by a synthetic poly(A) signal. The 308-bp fragment containing intron 9 poly(A) signal was amplified by PCR and subcloned into pGL3 with XbaI and BamHI, replacing the SV40 poly(A) site of pGL3. A synthetic poly(A) signal fragment was amplified by PCR using the unmodified pGL3 vector as the template and inserted at BamHI and SalI sites of the poly(A) reporter construct. The poly(A) signal mutations were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the pAlter in vitro mutagenesis system. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with these constructs as described (17Gong Q. Zhang L. Moss A.J. Vincent G.M. Ackerman M.J. Robinson J.C. Jones M.A. Tester D.J. Zhou Z. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2008; 44: 502-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The hERG1 minigene composed of hERG1 cDNA (exons 1–6) and hERG1 genomic DNA (intron 6 to poly(A) site) was constructed by replacing the hERG1a cDNA C-terminal intronless fragment with the intron-containing hERG1 genomic DNA fragment obtained from a human PAC clone consisting of hERG1 genomic sequence from intron 6 to the end of hERG1 gene (PR4-548K24). The minigene was subcloned into a modified pcDNA5 vector, in which the BGH poly(A) signal was deleted. Mutations of the hERG1 intron 9 poly(A) signal and 5′ splice site were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the pAlter in vitro mutagenesis system. The hERG1aUSO cDNA construct was generated by PCR from the human heart Marathon-Ready cDNA (Clontech) using a forward primer (5′-CTGGCCATGAAGTTCAAGACCACAC-3′) and a reverse primer (5′-AGGACTCCCTTTGCTTTGGATGTG-3′). The PCR fragment was inserted into pCRII vector by TA cloning (Invitrogen). The cDNA fragment of hERG1aUSO was sequenced and subcloned into the backbone of hERG1a at SphI and EcoRI sites to obtain the full-length hERG1aUSO cDNA. The hERG1a and hERG1aUSO cDNAs were subcloned into pcDNA5 vector. Flp-In HEK293 cells (Invitrogen) were stably transfected with pcDNA5 cDNA or minigene constructs and selected with 100 μg/ml of hygromycin B. Flp-In HEK293 cells, which contain a single integrated Flp recombination target site, allow stable integration of a single copy of the cDNA or minigene construct at a specific genomic site and, subsequently, similar expression in all cell clones. The human tissue total RNAs were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX) and Biochain (Hayward, CA). cDNAs were synthesized with the SuperScript III First Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR with random hexamers (Invitrogen). PCR was performed on the MX300P real time PCR machine (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). After denaturing at 95 °C for 10 min, the reaction was run for 40 cycles with denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s, annealing and primer extension at 60 °C for 1 min. The sequences of the primers used to distinguish hERG1 C-terminal isoforms were: hERG1FL forward (5′-CTTTGGGGAGCCTCTGAACC-3′), hERG1FL reverse (5′-GGACCAGAAGTGGTCGGAGAA-3′), hERG1USO forward (5′-CAGTCACTGGGGCTGTGGA-3′), and hERG1USO reverse (5′-GAGAATGTGGGAACCCCAGAG-3′). The primers for the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were: forward (5′-ACACCATGGGGAAGGTGAAG-3′) and reverse (5′-TGGGTGGAATCATATTGGAACA-3′). To take into account the amplification efficiency of each primer set, we used a plasmid DNA that contains partial cDNAs of hERG1FL, hERG1USO, and GAPDH as template for generating standard curves for each primer set. By using a plasmid in which the hERG1FL and hERG1USO cDNA fragments are at a 1:1 ratio, equal quantities can be assigned to each dilution point of the standard curves (18Vandenbroucke I.I. Vandesompele J. Paepe A.D. Messiaen L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: E68-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The amounts of the hERG1FL and hERG1USO transcripts in the samples were calculated using MxPro Quantitative-PCR software (Stratagene), and normalized to the amount of the GAPDH transcript in the same samples. RNA isolation and the RNase protection assay (RPA) were performed as previously described (19Gong Q. Zhang L. Vincent G.M. Horne B.D. Zhou Z. Circulation. 2007; 116: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly, antisense RNA riboprobes were transcribed in vitro in the presence of biotin-14-CTP. Yeast RNA was used as a control for the complete digestion of the probes by RNase. The relative intensity of each band was quantified using Scion Image software (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD) and adjusted for the number of biotin-labeled cytidines in each protected fragment. For hERG1 minigene experiments, the expression level of the hygromycin B resistance gene from the pcDNA5 vector was used as a loading control. Immunoblot analysis was performed as previously described (17Gong Q. Zhang L. Moss A.J. Vincent G.M. Ackerman M.J. Robinson J.C. Jones M.A. Tester D.J. Zhou Z. J. Mol.

The cell lysates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated with an anti-hERG1 antibody against the N terminus of hERG1a and hERG1aUSO proteins (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA) and visualized with the ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). The expression level of hygromycin B phosphotransferase encoded by the hygromycin B resistant gene in the pcDNA5 vector was used as a loading control (21Gritz L. Davies J. Gene. 1983; 25: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). The polyclonal anti-hygromycin B phosphotransferase antibody was custom generated by Genscript (Piscataway, NJ) using a peptide antigen corresponding to the last 14 amino acids (CSGNRRPSTRPRAKE) of hygromycin B phosphotransferase. The anti-hygromycin B phosphotransferase antibody was affinity purified and used at a 1:2000 dilution. Membrane currents were recorded in whole cell configuration using suction pipettes as previously described (17Gong Q. Zhang L. Moss A.J. Vincent G.M. Ackerman M.J. Robinson J.C.

Chem. 1998; 273: 21061-21066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). All patch clamp experiments were performed at 22–23 °C. The patch clamp data are presented as mean ± S.E. and analyzed by Student's t test. p < 0.05 is considered statistically significant. When hERG1aUSO was originally identified, it was unclear whether hERG1aUSO mRNA was polyadenylated (10Kupershmidt S. Snyders D.J. Raes A. Roden D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27231-27235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). A BLAST search of the human EST data base revealed that many USO-containing ESTs have a short poly(A) tail. However, these EST cDNA sequences lack the canonical poly(A) signal (AAUAAA) upstream of the 3′-poly(A) tail. Interestingly, hERG1 genomic DNA contains a 25-bp poly(A) stretch within intron 9. An alignment of the EST sequence BQ478289 with human genomic DNA revealed that the poly(A) tail of the EST matched the intronic sequence of hERG1 (Fig. 1). It is noted that none of the USO-containing ESTs have more than 25 adenosines in the poly(A) tails, suggesting that they may result from internal priming (i.e. oligo(dT) primers hybridizing to internal poly(A) stretches instead of the expected 3′ end poly(A) sequence). Because of this uncertainty, the poly(A) data base did not include hERG1USO transcripts as polyadenylated hERG1 variants (22Lee J.Y. Yeh I. Park J.Y. Tian B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: D165-D168Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to confirm that hERG1USO transcripts are generated by polyadenylation at the 3′ end rather than internal priming. To examine the polyadenylation status of hERG1USO transcripts we performed the RACE-PAT assay outlined in Fig. 2A. Annealing of the oligo(dT) portion of the primer to the poly(A) tail can occur anywhere along the entire length of the poly(A) tail. Therefore, a heterogeneous pool of first strand cDNA, primed at all possible positions along the poly(A) tail, is synthesized after reverse transcription. Subsequent PCR amplification using a reverse primer containing the anchor sequence without oligo(dT) and a forward primer specific to hERG1USO isoforms yielded a smeared band between 250 and 350 bp (Fig. 2B, lane 2). To demonstrate that the smeared band represents hERG1USO transcripts with different lengths of the poly(A) tail, the PCR products from lane 2 were cloned into the pCRII vector and 6 clones were sequenced. All 6 clones matched the hERG1USO sequences and contained poly(A) tails with 36, 38, 75, 85, 88, and 97 adenosines (Fig. 2C). This suggests that hERG1USO transcripts are polyadenylated due to cleavage and the addition of a poly(A) tail. Although it is not known from this experiment where the cleavage site is located, the cleavage should occur somewhere along the 25-nt poly(A) stretch. Thus, up to 25 adenosines of the poly(A) tail of hERG1USO transcripts are from the genomic DNA. Although the RACE-PAT assay demonstrated that hERG1USO isoforms arise from alternative polyadenylation, the poly(A) tail of hERG1USO transcripts lacks the upstream canonical poly(A) signal AAUAAA. Examination of the hERG1 genomic intron 9 sequence reveals the presence of a noncanonical poly(A) signal (AGUAAA) at the beginning of the 25-nt poly(A) stretch and several putative U/GU-rich elements downstream of the poly(A) stretch (supplemental Fig. S1). The AGUAAA sequence has been previously shown to initiate polyadenylation in other genes (23Sheets M.D. Ogg S.C. Wickens M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5799-5805Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 24Caron H. van Schaik B. van der Mee M. Baas F. Riggins G. van Sluis P. Hermus M.C. van Asperen R. Boon K. Voûte P.A. Heisterkamp S. van Kampen A. Versteeg R. Science. 2001; 291: 1289-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). To determine whether this intronic poly(A) signal and downstream U/GU elements can elicit polyadenylation, we performed a well described competition assay using a set of constructs with tandem poly(A) signals (25Brackenridge S. Ashe H.L. Giacca M. Proudfoot N.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2326-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 26Hall-Pogar T. Zhang H. Tian B. Lutz C.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 2565-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The hERG1 intron 9 poly(A) signal AGUAAA and flanking sequences (−130/+172 bp) were positioned upstream of a relatively strong synthetic poly(A) signal (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. S1). The tandem poly(A) signals are in competition with each other and the utilization of the intron 9 poly(A) signal relative to the synthetic poly(A) signal reflects the relative strength of the intron 9 poly(A) signal. This tandem poly(A) construct allows the experiments to be independent of transfection efficiency, as the two products are derived from the same plasmid (27van der Putten H.H. Spaargaren-van Riel C.C. Bertina R.M. Vos H.L. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2006; 4 (author reply 2288–2289): 2285-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The RNA derived from the tandem poly(A) construct was studied by RPA using a probe specific to 249 nt of hERG1 intron 9. Two possible fragments, 158 and 249 nt, can be generated after RNase digestion depending on which poly(A) signal is utilized (Fig. 3A). The total length of the probe was 379 nt and contained sequences from the pCRII vector at both ends. RPA analysis of the tandem poly(A) construct showed that both the hERG1 intron 9 poly(A) signal and the synthetic poly(A) signal were used (Fig. 3B, left panel). The ratio of intron 9 to the synthetic (intron 9/synthetic) poly(A) signal usage was 2.8 ± 0.1 (n = 3). To further define a functional role of this noncanonical poly(A) signal we mutated AGUAAA to CGCAAA and performed RPA analysis using a probe containing the same mutation. The results showed that transcription was terminated predominantly at the synthetic poly(A) signal (Fig. 3B, middle panel). These results suggest that the poly(A) signal AGUAAA in hERG1 intron 9 contributes to the formation of poly(A) tail of hERG1USO transcripts. Previous studies have shown that the noncanonical poly(A) signal AGUAAA is less efficient than canonical poly(A) signal AAUAAA (23Sheets M.D. Ogg S.C. Wickens M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5799-5805Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). To test whether the hERG1 intron 9 noncanonical poly(A) signal is weak, we mutated AGUAAA to the canonical poly(A) sequence AAUAAA. We performed RPA analysis using a probe containing the AAUAAA mutation and found that the 158-nt protected fragment was predominantly generated from the intron 9 poly(A) signal (Fig. 3B, right panel). These results strongly suggest that the poly(A) signal in hERG1 intron 9 is intrinsically weak due to the presence of the noncanonical hexamer AGUAAA. The presence of a poly(A) signal in hERG1 intron 9 suggests that this intron is alternatively processed during hERG1 pre-mRNA maturation. To study the alternative processing of hERG1 pre-mRNA to hERG1a and hERG1aUSO isoforms we constructed a minigene that contained the hERG1a cDNA from exon 1 to exon 6 and the genomic sequence spanning intron 6 to the poly(A) signal of the hERG1 gene (Fig. 4A). If intron 9 is spliced out and the poly(A) site in exon 15 is used, the full-length hERG1a transcript will be produced. If the minigene transcript is polyadenylated at the intron 9 poly(A) site, the hERG1aUSO transcript will be generated. We transfected the minigene into Flp-In HEK293 cells and analyzed the expressed mRNA by RPA. We designed a probe to span regions of exons 9 and 10. This probe protects a 309-nt fragment of the hERG1a transcript and a 210-nt fragment of the hERG1aUSO transcript. The length of the probe was 440 nt and contained sequences from the pCRII vector at both ends. As shown in Fig. 4B, both the 309- and 210-nt fragments were observed in the minigene RPA experiments. The hERG1aUSO to hERG1a (hERG1aUSO/hERG1a) expression ratio was 1.9 ± 0.1 (n = 3). To confirm the validity of this result, a second probe was designed, which contains hERG1aUSO sequences from exon 9 to intron 9. A similar hERG1aUSO/hERG1a expression ratio (2.1 ± 0.1, n = 3) was obtained in RPA analysis (supplemental Fig. S2). These results demonstrate that the hERG1 minigene expressed in HEK293 cells can be alternatively processed to form hERG1a and hERG1aUSO transcripts. To determine whether the minigene can produce hERG1a and hERG1aUSO proteins, we performed immunoblot analysis using an antibody that recognizes both hERG1a and hERG1aUSO isoforms. As shown in supplemental Fig. S3A, the hERG1 minigene expressed three protein bands at about 155, 135, and 100 kDa, consistent with the sizes of hERG1a and hERG1aUSO proteins expressed from cDNA constructs (supplemental Fig. S3A, lanes 1, 4, and 5). The 155-kDa band represents the complex-glycosylated mature form of the hERG1a protein, the 135-kDa band represents the core-glycosylated immature form of the hERG1a protein (20Zhou Z. Gong Q. Epstein M.L. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21061-21066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), and the 100-kDa band represents the core-glycosylated form of the hERG1aUSO protein (11Guasti L. Crociani O. Redaelli E. Pillozzi S. Polvani S. Masselli M. Mello T. Galli A. Amedei A. Wymore R.S. Wanke E. Arcangeli A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 5043-5060Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The protein expression ratio of hERG1aUSO to hERG1a in the minigene was 1.2 ± 0.2 (n = 4), which is lower than the expression ratio of hERG1aUSO/hERG1a transcripts. This is likely due to degradation of the hERG1aUSO protein by the proteasome pathway (11Guasti L. Crociani O. Redaelli E. Pillozzi S. Polvani S. Masselli M. Mello T. Galli A. Amedei A. Wymore R.S. Wanke E. Arcangeli A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 5043-5060Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To study how the strength of the poly(A) signal affects the alternative processing of hERG1 mRNA, we performed mutagenesis in the context of the hERG1 minigene. When the intron 9 poly(A) signal AGUAAA was changed to the canonical poly(A) signal, AAUAAA, the expression of hERG1aUSO was increased at both mRNA and protein levels, whereas the expression of hERG1a was almost completely inhibited (Fig. 4B and supplemental Fig. S3A, lane 2). In contrast, mutation of the intron 9 poly(A) signal from AGUAAA to CGCAAA resulted in a significant decrease in the levels of hERG1aUSO mRNA and protein, which was accompanied by a reciprocal increase in the expression of hERG1a mRNA and protein (Fig. 4B and supplemental Fig. S3A, lane 3). These results indicate that the strength of the intron 9 poly(A) signal plays an important role in determining the relative expression of hERG1a and hERG1aUSO. A strong poly(A) signal results in the predominant production of hERG1aUSO, whereas the elimination of the poly(A) signal increases the efficiency of splicing from exon 9 to exon 10, leading to the predominant expression of hERG1a. To investigate the role of intron 9 splicing in"

Whereas the fate of sulfoacetaldehyde in Cupriavidus necator (Ralstonia eutropha) H16 is known, the pathway from sulfoacetate to sulfoacetaldehyde is not. The genome sequence of the organism enabled us to hypothesize that the inducible pathway, which initiates sau (sulfoacetate utilization), involved a four-gene cluster (sauRSTU; H16_A2746 to H16_A2749). The sauR gene, divergently orientated to the other three genes, probably encodes the transcriptional regulator of the presumed sauSTU operon, which is subject to inducible transcription. SauU was tentatively identified as a transporter of the major facilitator superfamily, and SauT was deduced to be a sulfoacetate-CoA ligase. SauT was a labile protein, but it could be separated and shown to generate AMP and an unknown, labile CoA-derivative from sulfoacetate, CoA, and ATP. This unknown compound, analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS, had a relative molecular mass of 889.7, which identified it as protonated sulfoacetyl-CoA (calculated 889.6). SauS was deduced to be sulfoacetaldehyde dehydrogenase (acylating). The enzyme was purified 175-fold to homogeneity and characterized. Peptide mass fingerprinting confirmed the sauS locus (H16_A2747). SauS converted sulfoacetyl-CoA and NADPH to sulfoacetaldehyde, CoA, and NADP+, thus confirming the hypothesis.

Sulfoacetic acid, as the sulfonate ester, was first recognized as a natural product in plant alkaloids (1Folkers K. Koniuszy F. Shavel J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1944; 66: 1083-1087Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Free sulfoacetate was then found to be widespread in plants and algae (2Gupta S.D. Sastry P.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 260: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 3Lee R.F. Benson A.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 261: 35-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 4Shibuya I. Yagi T. Benson A.A. Studies on Microalgae and Photosynthetic Bacteria. The University of Tokyo Press, Tokyo1963: 627-636Google Scholar). The compound was also detected as an intracellular intermediate in the bacterial degradation of the plant sulfolipid (sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol), specifically from its polar head group, sulfoquinovose (5Martelli H.L. Benson A.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 93: 169-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This sulfolipid is nearly ubiquitous in phototrophic organisms (6Harwood J.L. Stumpf P.K. The Biochemistry of Plants. Academic Press, New York1980: 301-320Google Scholar) and may represent up to half of the total lipid content in some marine algae (7Dembitsky V.M. Rozentsvet O.A. Pechenkina E.E. Phytochemistry. 1990; 29: 3417-3421Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The sulfur content of leaves is comprised mainly of sulfolipid and proteins; senescence of deciduous plants thus introduces significant amounts of sulfoquinovose into the soil (8Harwood J.L. Nicholls R.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1979; 7: 440-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Sulfoacetate can also be the product of the bacterial assimilation of nitrogen from taurine (9Denger K. Weinitschke S. Hollemeyer K. Cook A.M. Arch. Microbiol. 2004; 182: 254-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 10Krejcík Z. Denger K. Weinitschke S. Hollemeyer K. Paces V. Cook A.M. Smits T.H. Arch. Microbiol. 2008; 190: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The latter precursor of sulfoacetate is a major organic solute in marine creatures (11Allen J.A. Garrett M.R. Adv. Mar.

Moreover, sulfoacetate is introduced into the environment as sodium lauryl sulfoacetate, a frequent ingredient of cosmetics and personal care products. Biodegradation of sulfoacetate was first observed by Martelli and Benson (5Martelli H.L. Benson A.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 93: 169-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and evidence was presented for the hydrolytic cleavage of sulfoacetate to glycolate, but the organism was lost (15Cook A.M. Denger K. Arch. Microbiol. 2002; 179: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 16Martelli H.L. Souza S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 208: 110-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). King and Quinn (17King J.E. Quinn J.P. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 3907-3912Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar) isolated aerobic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, which degraded sulfoacetate by a different pathway, involving desulfonation via inducible sulfoacetaldehyde acetyltransferase (Xsc) 4The abbreviation used is: Xscsulfoacetaldehyde acetyltransferase. (EC 2.3.3.15). Various anaerobic bacteria were also found to utilize sulfoacetate via Xsc (15Cook A.M. Denger K. Arch. Microbiol. 2002; 179: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The aerobic Ralstonia sp. strain EDS1 dissimilates a range of organosulfonates, including sulfoacetate, via Xsc, and the low molar growth yield with sulfoacetate (60% of the value for all other carbon sources) led to the conclusion that the reduction of sulfoacetate to sulfoacetaldehyde, the organic substrate of Xsc, was metabolically expensive (18Denger K. Cook A.M. Arch. Microbiol. 2001; 176: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The inducible involvement of Xsc in the degradation of sulfoacetate, taurine, and isethionate was confirmed in Cupriavidus necator (Ralstonia eutropha) H16, where the common pathway also included phosphate acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.8), a sulfite exporter TauE (TC 9.A.29.2.1) and sulfite dehydrogenase (SorAB) (EC 1.8.2.1) (Fig. 1) (19Denger K. Weinitschke S. Smits T.H. Schleheck D. Cook A.M. Microbiology. 2008; 154: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 20Weinitschke S. Denger K. Cook A.M. Smits T.H. Microbiology. 2007; 153: 3055-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). sulfoacetaldehyde acetyltransferase. It was still unclear which proteins catalyzed the formation of sulfoacetaldehyde from sulfoacetate. However, although the convergence of metabolism of C2 sulfonates at one Xsc (Fig. 1) is widespread (15Cook A.M. Denger K. Arch. Microbiol. 2002; 179: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), some organisms contain paralogues of xsc, e.g. Desulfitobacterium hafniense DCB-2 (Dhaf_0189 and Dhaf_4634). We showed that the presence of more than one xsc gene in a genome can represent complete, individual degradative pathways for different sulfonates (21Weinitschke S. Sharma P.I. Stingl U. Cook A.M. Smits T.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 618-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Using this idea in D. hafniense DCB-2, where the gene cluster upstream of one xsc was annotated as encoding an acyl-CoA ligase and a NAD(P)-coupled aldehyde dehydrogenase (Dhaf_0190), we hypothesized that this combination of reaction types would convert sulfoacetate to sulfoacetaldehyde via putative sulfoacetyl-CoA. Orthologues of the presumptive sulfoacetaldehyde dehydrogenase (deacylating) (SauS, for sulfoacetate utilization) (Fig. 2A) are widespread, and one sauS gene is found in a four-gene cluster in C. necator H16. We chose to explore the sauRSTU cluster (Fig. 2B) in C. necator H16, with which we had relevant experience (Fig. 1). Strain H16 grows relatively fast with sulfoacetate as a sole source of carbon and energy for growth, and an established protocol to generate in-frame deletions in this organism is available (22Lenz O. Schwartz E. Dernedde J. Eitinger M. Friedrich B. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4385-4393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Jeffke T. Gropp N.H. Kaiser C. Grzeszik C. Kusian B. Bowien B. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4374-4380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our hypothesis comprised an IclR-type transcriptional regulator, SauR (H16_A2746), a sulfoacetate-CoA ligase, SauT (H16_A2748), a sulfoacetaldehyde dehydrogenase (acylating), SauS (H16_A2747), and a sulfoacetate transporter belonging to the major facilitator superfamily, SauU (H16_2749) (Fig. 2B). Sulfoacetate (99% purity) was purchased from Acros Organics (Geel, Belgium). Other commercial chemicals (∼99% purity) were from Fluka (Seelze, Germany), Merck or Sigma-Aldrich. Sulfoacetyl-CoA is not available commercially, and we failed to synthesize it chemically using protocols to synthesize 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA (24Chohan S.N. Copeland L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 2859-2863Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Stadtman T.C. Elliott P. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 228: 983-997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Microsynth (Balgach, Switzerland). Materials for (RT-)PCR and cloning were purchased from Fermentas GmbH (St. Leon-Rot, Germany) and used as provided by the supplier. Phusion DNA Polymerase from NEB (Ipswich, UK) was used during the construction of deletion mutants. Chromosomal DNA was isolated as described elsewhere (26Desomer J. Crespi M. Van Montagu M. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2115-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated using the E.Z.N.A. bacterial kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Doraville, GA). PCR products were purified using QIAquick® spin kit (Qiagen). C. necator H16 (DSM 428) (27Pohlmann A. Fricke W.F. Reinecke F. Kusian B. Liesegang H. Cramm R. Eitinger T. Ewering C. Pötter M. Schwartz E. Strittmatter A. Voss I. Gottschalk G. Steinbüchel A. Friedrich B. Bowien B. Nat. Biotechnol. 2006; 24: 1257-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) was isolated in Göttingen, Germany. The organism was grown at 30 °C in freshwater, mineral salt medium (28Thurnheer T. Köhler T. Cook A.M. Leisinger T. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1986; 132: 1215-1220Google Scholar). Sulfoacetate (10–20 mm) was used routinely as the sole added source of carbon and energy for growth. For enzyme assays with the mutants, which were unable to grow with sulfoacetate, 10 mm acetate served as a growth substrate in the presence of 10 mm sulfoacetate to induce the sulfoacetate degradative enzymes. Precultures and cultures (5 ml) for the determination of the substrate range were grown in 50-ml screw-cap tubes in a roller. Growth experiments were done on the 50-ml scale in 300-ml Erlenmeyer flasks on a shaker; samples were taken at intervals to measure optical density at 580 nm, to assay protein, and to determine the concentrations of substrate and products. Strains of Escherichia coli used for site-directed mutagenesis (supplemental Table S1) were grown in LB medium at 37 °C. Appropriate antibiotics were added to medium in the following concentrations: 50 μg ml−1 ampicillin, 20 μg ml−1 tetracycline, and 5 μg ml−1 trimethoprim. Cell-free extracts were obtained from strain H16 grown on the 1-liter scale in 5-liter Erlenmeyer flasks. The cells were harvested in the midexponential growth phase by centrifugation (30,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C), washed in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2 (containing 5 mm MgCl2), and resuspended in a small volume (2–5 ml) of the same buffer. The cells were disrupted by four passages through a chilled French press set at 138 MPa, and whole cells and cell debris were removed by centrifugation (20,000 × g, 3 min, 4 °C). The membrane and soluble fractions were obtained by ultracentrifugation (200,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). DNA was removed by DNase, which was added prior to disruption. SauT was assayed discontinuously by HPLC as the formation of sulfoacetyl-CoA. The reaction mixture contained (in a final volume of 1 ml): 50 μmol of Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0 or 9.0 (containing 5 mm MgCl2), 1 μmol of ATP, 2 μmol of sulfoacetate, 0.5 μmol of CoA, and 0.1–1 mg of protein. SauT activity was estimated as a decrease in concentration of CoA, because no reference material of sulfoacetyl-CoA was available to quantify the novel compound. Sulfoacetaldehyde dehydrogenase (acylating) (SauS) was assayed spectrophotometrically as the sulfoacetaldehyde-dependent reduction of NADP+ at 365 nm, which is the reverse reaction. The reaction mixture contained (in a final volume of 1 ml): 50 μmol of Tris/HCl buffer, pH 9.0 (containing 5 mm MgCl2), 1 μmol of NADP+, 3 μmol of sulfoacetaldehyde, 0.5 μmol of CoA, and 1–100 μg of protein. The reaction was linear for at least 1 min. The first step to purify SauS, anion exchange chromatography (MonoQ, HR 10/10; Pharmacia), was performed with the soluble protein fraction at a flow rate of 1 ml min×1. An increasing gradient of sodium sulfate in 50 mm Tris/sulfate buffer, pH 8.7, was applied, and SauS was eluted at 85 mm sodium sulfate. Active fractions were combined, rebuffered on PD10 columns with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, and loaded on to a cation exchange column (MonoS, HR 5/5; Pharmacia). An increasing gradient of sodium sulfate was applied, and SauS was eluted at 95 mm sodium sulfate. N-terminal amino acid sequencing and peptide mass fingerprinting were done by Toplab (Martinsried, Germany) on bands excised from SDS-PAGE gels. The first step to separate SauT, anion exchange chromatography with a MonoQ HR 10/10 column, was done with soluble fraction in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. An increasing gradient of sodium sulfate was applied, and SauT eluted at 120 mm sodium sulfate. Fractions were desalted, concentrated, and subjected to hydroxyapatite column chromatography in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.7. An increasing gradient of potassium phosphate was applied, and SauT eluted at ∼100 mm potassium phosphate. Sulfoacetate was determined by ion chromatography (9Denger K. Weinitschke S. Hollemeyer K. Cook A.M. Arch. Microbiol. 2004; 182: 254-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Sulfate was quantified turbidimetrically as an insoluble suspension of BaSO4 (29Sörbo B. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Sulfite was quantified as the fuchsin adduct (30Ruff J. Denger K. Cook A.M. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 275-285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Growth was followed turbidimetrically at 580 nm or assayed as Lowry-type protein in whole cells (31Kennedy S.I. Fewson C.A. Biochem. J. 1968; 107: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Protein content of crude cell extracts was determined by protein dye binding (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216033) Google Scholar). Denatured proteins were analyzed on 13% SDS-PAGE gels and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207129) Google Scholar). The native molecular weight of separated proteins was calculated after gel filtration by interpolation in a standard curve. The values of Kmapp were derived by hyperbolic curve fitting. Sulfoacetyl-CoA was visualized by reversed phase HPLC and a diode array detector. The stationary phase was Nucleosil 5-C18 (125 × 3 mm). The mobile phase (0.5 ml min−1) was a 100 mm potassium phosphate solution, pH 5, with a gradient from 0 to 30% methanol. The identity of sulfoacetyl-CoA was confirmed by MALDI-TOF-MS. Samples of reaction mixtures containing putative sulfoacetyl-CoA generated in an assay of SauS were mixed with a matrix of saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile and 1% trifluoroacetic acid. The dried droplet method was used with 0.8-μl samples on a MALDI steel target, and samples were analyzed in the negative ion mode in an Applied Biosystems 4800 MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (34Hollemeyer K. Velagapudi V.R. Wittmann C. Heinzle E. Rapid Commun. Mass. Spectrom. 2007; 21: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Standard DNA techniques (35Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E.

Low throughput plasmid DNA was isolated using the QIAprep® miniprep kit, and high throughput isolation of plasmid DNA was done using a boiling method (37Holmes D.S. Quigley M. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar). Colony PCR was done as described elsewhere (38Coenye T. Goris J. Spilker T. Vandamme P. LiPuma J.J. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2002; 40: 2062-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Sequencing was done at GATC (Konstanz, Germany) or Microsynth, and the sequences were analyzed using the Lasergene package from DNASTAR (Madison, WI). The primers listed in supplemental Table S2 were used for RT-PCR. PCR was done as described elsewhere (39Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1990: 3-12Google Scholar). The absence of DNA after isolation of RNA was tested by PCR using primers for xsc. Positive controls for the success of RNA isolation were done after reverse transcription using the 16 S rRNA-specific primers 16S-27F and 16S-533R (supplemental Table S2) (40Weisburg W.G. Barns S.M. Pelletier D.A. Lane D.J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 697-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (8843) Google Scholar). The PCR products were visualized after separation on 1.5% agarose gels. Mutants of C. necator H16 containing in-frame deletions in one of the sauSTU genes were constructed by gene replacement mutagenesis as detailed in the supplemental data. Thereby, a wild type functional gene was replaced by an engineered defective short gene (see below). The sequence of the genome of C. necator H16 (accession numbers NC_008313 and NC_008314) was obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information, whose BLAST (41Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59856) Google Scholar) server was also used. Sequence data were analyzed using different subroutines of the LASERGENE software package (DNASTAR), with SignalP (42Bendtsen J.D. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (5639) Google Scholar), available from the Center for Biological Sequence Analysis, with PROSITE, on the ExPASy Proteomics Server, and with the BLAST server of the Transport Classification Database. C. necator H16 grew exponentially (μ = 0.14 h−1) with 10–20 mm sulfoacetate as the sole source of carbon and energy (Fig. 3A). Growth was concomitant with substrate utilization and with the stoichiometric recovery of the sulfonate moiety as sulfate (Fig. 3B). The molar growth yield was 5.1 g of protein (mol C)−1, significantly lower than the 6.0–6.6 g of protein (mol C)−1 with taurine, isethionate, or acetate; the latter is a normal value, which indicates mass balance for carbon (43Cook A.M. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 46: 93-116Crossref Google Scholar). The specific utilization rate of sulfoacetate was calculated to be 3.8 millikatals (kg of protein)−1. The first scalar enzyme in the postulated pathway (Fig. 2A) was SauT. Extracts of acetate- (Table 1), taurine-, or isethionate-grown cells (not shown) showed no activity of this enzyme. Extracts of sulfoacetate-grown cells catalyzed the CoA- and ATP-dependent conversion of sulfoacetate to sulfoacetyl-CoA (see below) and AMP (including nonspecific activity). This was interpreted as inducible activity of SauT, which was shown by ultracentrifugation of crude extract to be in the soluble fraction. The specific activity of the enzyme was low (Table 1) and difficult to quantify, because we could not stop the reaction without destroying the sulfoacetyl-CoA formed during the reaction.TABLE 1Activities of enzymes and transcription of genes under different growth conditions of C. necator H16Specific activityaSpecific enzyme activity is given in the SI unit millikatal (kg of protein)−1. or transcriptionCells grown with sulfoacetateCells grown with acetateTranscription of sauU (sulfoacetate uptake)+bRNA transcript is scored as: −, absent; +, strong.

Extracts of acetate- (Table 1), taurine-, or isethionate-grown cells (not shown) showed no activity of this enzyme. Extracts of sulfoacetate-grown cells catalyzed the NADP+- and CoA-dependent conversion of sulfoacetaldehyde to sulfoacetyl-CoA (see below). This was interpreted as inducible activity of SauS, which was found to be soluble. The enzyme was highly active (Table 1), which allowed enough sulfoacetyl-CoA to be collected from the HPLC to confirm that SauS was also active in the forward reaction. SauS was identified as the gene product encoded at H16_A2747 (see below). Each of the candidate genes (Fig. 2B) to encode SauU (H16_A2749), SauT (H16_A2748), or SauS (H16_A2747) was found to be transcribed inducibly (Table 1), which corresponded to the inducible nature of the degradative pathway (Table 1). We were able to generate three deletion mutants, each with an in-frame mutation in sauU (H16ΔsauU), sauT (H16ΔsauT), or sauS (H16ΔsauS), respectively (Fig. 4). None of these mutants grew with sulfoacetate, but each grew with acetate, taurine, isethionate, or sulfoacetaldehyde, as the wild type did. The mutations were specific for sulfoacetate metabolism (Fig. 1). Mutant H16ΔsauU synthesized neither SauS nor SauT (Table 2), so presumably no sulfoacetate entered the cell to enable induction to occur. In contrast, mutant H16ΔsauT expressed SauS (Table 2) and mutant H16ΔsauS expressed SauT (Table 2), so regulation of the gene cluster, presumably by SauR (Fig. 2B), was unaffected. No mutation in sauR was obtained. There appears to be irrefutable evidence for the functions of SauSTU.TABLE 2Phenotypes and enzyme activities of different mutants of C. necator H16H16ΔsauSH16ΔsauTH16ΔsauUGrowth with sulfoacetateActivity of sulfoacetaldehyde dehydrogenase (SauS)bdlabdl, below detection limit.22.3bSpecific enzyme activity is given in the SI unit millikatal (kg of protein)−1.bdlActivity of sulfoacetate-CoA ligase (SauT)0.03bdlbdla bdl, below detection limit.b Specific enzyme activity is given in the SI unit millikatal (kg of protein)−1. Open table in a new tab Putative sulfoacetyl-CoA was detected by HPLC as a novel peak generated during the activation of sulfoacetate by SauT and during the oxidation of sulfoacetaldehyde by SauS. The UV spectrum of the unknown involved maxima at 212 and 257 nm and a minimum at 225 nm, similar to HSCoA but with a slightly shorter (0.7 min) retention time. The compound had a half-life of ∼2 h under these conditions (pH 9.0), with shorter half-lives at higher and lower pH values. Samples taken during the reaction of purified SauS with sulfoacetaldehyde, NADP+, and HSCoA were analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS in the negative ion mode. The formation of a compound (m/z = 888.7 = [M − 1]−) was detected. The value of M (889.7) corresponds to that calculated (889.6) for protonated sulfoacetyl-CoA. This was taken as confirmation of the identity of sulfoacetyl-CoA. Two separative steps with SauT were possible before activity was lost. This preparation showed sulfoacetate-dependent formation of sulfoacetyl-CoA and of AMP, but SauT was insufficiently concentrated to be visible on SDS-PAGE gels. SauS was purified 175-fold to apparent homogeneity (Fig. 5) in two steps (Table 3). The sequence of six N-terminal amino acids was determined to be SVQILH. This corresponded to the derived sequence of only one ORF (H16_A2747) in the genome of C. necator H16, which confirmed our hypothetical locus for sauS (Fig. 2B). Peptide mass fingerprinting of SauS confirmed this conclusion. The derived molecular mass of mature SauS, 51.5 kDa, corresponds to the value (∼52 kDa) for the denatured protein (Fig. 5) interpolated into the standard curve. Separation of native SauS on a calibrated gel filtration column allowed a molecular mass of 115 kDa to be calculated. Given the errors in the method (44le Maire M. Ghasi A. Moller J.V. ACS Symp. Ser. 1996; 635: 36-51Crossref Google Scholar), we tentatively postulate that native SauS is a dimer.TABLE 3Purification of sulfoacetaldehyde dehydrogenase (SauS) from C. necator H16Purification stepSpecific activityVolumeTotal proteinRecoveryPurificationmillikatals kg−1mlmg%foldCrude cell extract72.1531001Soluble fraction92.037941Anion exchanger (pool)353.54375Cation exchanger11910.90.0021175 Open table in a new tab SauS was specific for NADP+ as a cofactor that could not be replaced by NAD+. The Kmapp values for NADP+, CoA, and sulfoacetaldehyde were 64, 102, and 330 μm, respectively. The enzyme was specific for sulfoacetaldehyde; none of the 10 tested compounds was a substrate: acetaldehyde, phosphonoacetaldehyde, glycolaldehyde, formaldehyde, propionaldehyde, succinic semialdehyde, glyoxylate, betaine aldehyde, glyceraldehyde, and 2-oxobutanoic acid. None of these compounds inhibited the enzyme reaction. The optimal activity of the enzyme was obtained in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 9.0, containing 5 mm magnesium chloride. The enzyme could be stored at 4 or −18 °C but lost 30% of its activity after 1 week. The hypothetical pathway contains three steps, one vectorial and two scalar, and a novel metabolic intermediate, sulfoacetyl-CoA (Fig. 2A). Evidence for sulfoacetyl-CoA was obtained by HPLC and confirmed by MALDI-TOF-MS. Our earlier hypothesis, a phosphorylated intermediate analogous to steps in the biosynthesis of, for example, lysine or proline (18Denger K. Cook A.M. Arch. Microbiol. 2001; 176: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), is thus invalid. Sulfoacetyl-CoA must be almost as ubiquitous as sulfoacetate, but it will be almost undetectable in the environment, partly because it is intracellular and partly because it is so labile. We suggested that sulfoacetate is a ubiquitous natural product (see the Introduction), although there are no direct determinations of this. The biodiversity of sulfoacetate degradation 5S. Weinitschke, M. Buhmann, T. H. M. Smits, and A. M. Cook, manuscript in preparation. may be considered to support this hypothesis, because organisms have evolved and sustained so many different variants of the degradative pathway. The reactions we have established (Fig. 2) seem to be novel in degradative pathways. The weakest portion of our hypothesis is the identification of the transcriptional regulator, SauR, attributed to locus tag H16_A2746. The gene cluster, sauSTU, is inducibly transcribed, and the enzymes are expressed inducibly (Table 1), so a regulator is involved. The regulator encoded adjacent to sauSTU was suggested as the simplest hypothesis, given the conserved sauRSTU cluster in all relevant betaproteobacteria.5 The first step in the pathway is transport, which involves SauU in C. necator H16 (Fig. 2). The cytoplasmic membrane is apparently impermeable for sulfoacetate unless a transporter is present, because deletion mutant H16ΔsauU is obviously unable to induce expression of the sau cluster (Table 2). This emphasizes the impermeability of membranes to sulfonates pointed out elsewhere (45Graham D.E. Xu H. White R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13421-13429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 46Mampel J. Maier E. Tralau T. Ruff J. Benz R. Cook A.M. Biochem. J. 2004; 383: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and supports the idea that nature uses the sulfonate substituent to prevent a molecule crossing a membrane. The sequence of SauU indicates that it belongs to the major facilitator superfamily (TC 2.A.1.-.-) of transporters. The closest orthologues (TC 2.A.1.14.-) have ∼30% sequence identity and share the predicted structure of 12 transmembrane helices. Sulfoacetate-CoA ligase, SauT, was separated sufficiently to allow us to confirm a systematic name, sulfoacetate:CoA ligase (AMP-forming) (EC 6.2.1.-). This enzyme represents one major energy drain in the pathway (with SauS as another) compared with, for example, taurine or isethionate (Fig. 2A), given that each named growth substrate yields only one acetyl-CoA for energy conservation and anabolism (Fig. 1). This degradative pathway (Fig. 2A) makes it easy to understand how 20–40% (this paper and Ref. 18Denger K. Cook A.M. Arch. Microbiol. 2001; 176: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) reductions in molar growth yield occur. Sulfoacetaldehyde dehydrogenase (acylating) (SauS), apparently the marker enzyme for the pathway,5 has been purified in this study. It shows the highest similarity to aldehyde dehydrogenases (acylating) (EC 1.2.1.10), a reaction it does not catalyze. (Acet)aldehyde dehydrogenases (EC 1.2.1.-) (47Powlowski J. Sahlman L. Shingler V. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 377-385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are thought to be NAD+-dependent enzymes (also reacting with NADP+ but at a lower rate), existing as dimers (48Söhling B. Gottschalk G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), tetramers, or polymers. Purified sulfoacetaldehyde dehydrogenase (acylating) from C. necator H16 is presumed to form a dimer in solution but acts solely with NADP+ as a cofactor, and sulfoacetaldehyde and CoA act as substrates. SauS must be distinguished both from sulfoacetaldehyde dehydrogenase, SafD (EC 1.2.1.73), which is specific for NAD+ and generates sulfoacetate from sulfoacetaldehyde (10Krejcík Z. Denger K. Weinitschke S. Hollemeyer K. Paces V. Cook A.M. Smits T.H. Arch. Microbiol. 2008; 190: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and from sulfoacetaldehyde reductase, IsfD (EC 1.1.1.-), which generates isethionate from sulfoacetaldehyde and NADP+ (49Krejcík Z. Hollemeyer K. Smits T.H. Cook A.M. Microbiology. 2010; 156: 1547-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We propose that SauS, nonidentical with any reported enzyme, should have the accepted name “sulfoacetaldehyde dehydrogenase (acylating)” and the systematic name “2-sulfoacetaldehyde:NADP+ oxidoreductase (CoA-acylating)” (EC 1.2.1.-). We are grateful to Gertrud Stahlhut for excellent technical advice on mutagenesis, to Valentina Vongrad for data generated during a practical course for advanced students, and to Karin Denger for discussions and for critically reading the manuscript. We also thank Tobias Erb (Freiburg, Germany) for sharing his experience on synthesizing CoA-esters and the late Hal Dixon (Cambridge, UK) for phosphonoacetaldehyde.

https://openalex.org/W1979396311,"The anticoagulant vitamin K-dependent protein S (PS) circulates in plasma in two forms, 30% free and 70% being bound to the complement regulatory protein C4b-binding protein (C4BP). The major C4BP isoform consists of 7 α-chains and 1 β-chain (C4BPβ(+)), the chains being linked by disulfide bridges. PS binds to the β-chain with high affinity. In plasma, PS is in molar excess over C4BPβ(+) and due to the high affinity, all C4BPβ(+) molecules contain a bound PS. Taken together with the observation that PS-deficient patients have decreased levels of C4BPβ(+), this raises the question of whether PS is important for secretion of the β-chain from the cell. To test this hypothesis, HEK293 cells were stably and transiently transfected with β-chain cDNA in combinations with cDNAs for PS and/or the α-chain. The concentration of β-chains in the medium increased after co-transfection with PS cDNA, but not by α-chain cDNA, suggesting secretion of the β-chains from the cells to be dependent on concomitant synthesis of PS, but not of the α-chains. Thus, β-chains that were not disulfide-linked to the α-chains were secreted in complex with PS, either as monomers or dimers. Pulse-chase demonstrated that the complexes between PS and β-chain were formed intracellularly, in the endoplasmic reticulum. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that successful secretion of β-chains depends on intracellular complex formation with PS, but not on the α-chains. This provides an explanation for the decreased β-chain levels observed in PS-deficient patients."
https://openalex.org/W2015559582,"Phospholipase D (PLD), a major source of lipid second messengers (phosphatidic acid, diglycerides) in many cell types, is tightly regulated by protein kinases, but only a few of them have been identified. We show here that protein kinase B (AKT) is a novel major signaling effector of PLD activity induced by the formylpeptide f-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) in human neutrophil-like HL-60 cells (dHL-60 cells). AKT inhibition with the selective antagonist AKTib1/2 almost completely prevented fMLP-mediated activity of PLD, its upstream effector ERK1/2, but not p38 MAPK. Immunoprecipitation studies show that phosphorylated AKT, ERK, and PLD2 form a complex induced by fMLP, which can be prevented by AKTib1/2. In cell-free systems, AKT1 stimulated PLD activity via activation of ERK. AKT1 actually phosphorylated ERK2 as a substrate (K(m) 1 μm). Blocking AKT activation with AKTib1/2 also prevented fMLP- but not phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-mediated NADPH oxidase activation (respiratory burst, RB) of dHL-60 cells. Impaired RB was associated with defective membrane translocation of NADPH oxidase components p67(phox) and p47(phox), ERK, AKT1, AKT2, but not AKT3. Depletion of AKT1 or AKT2 with antisense oligonucleotides further indicates a partial contribution of both isoforms in fMLP-induced activation of ERK, PLD, and RB, with a predominant role of AKT1. Thus, formylpeptides induce sequential activation of AKT, ERK1/2, and PLD, which represents a novel signaling pathway. A major primarily role of this AKT signaling pathway also emerges in membrane recruitment of NOX2 components p47(phox), p67(phox), and ERK, which may contribute to assembly and activation of the RB motor system, NADPH oxidase."
