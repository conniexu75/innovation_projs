Whether these receptors are redundant, interact, or play at least partially distinct roles is unknown. It is possible that PAR1 and/or PAR4 might confer responsiveness to proteases other than thrombin. The neutrophil granule protease, cathepsin G, is known to cause platelet secretion and aggregation. We now report that this action of cathepsin G is mediated by PAR4. Cathepsin G triggered calcium mobilization in PAR4-transfected fibroblasts, PAR4-expressingXenopus oocytes, and washed human platelets. An antibody raised against the PAR4 thrombin cleavage site blocked platelet activation by cathepsin G but not other agonists. Desensitization with a PAR4 activating peptide had a similar effect. By contrast, inhibition of PAR1 function had no effect on platelet responses to cathepsin G. When neutrophils were present, the neutrophil agonist fMet-Leu-Phe triggered calcium signaling in Fura-2-loaded platelets. Strikingly, this neutrophil-dependent platelet activation was blocked by the PAR4 antibody. These data show that PAR4 mediates platelet responses to cathepsin G and support the hypothesis that cathepsin G might mediate neutrophil-platelet interactions at sites of vascular injury or inflammation.

PAR1 is activated by an unusual mechanism in which thrombin cleaves the receptor amino-terminal exodomain to expose a new amino terminus that then serves as a tethered ligand (1.Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T.

Chem. 1994; 269: 16041-16045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The synthetic peptide SFLLRN, which mimics the first six amino acids of this newly unmasked amino terminus, can activate PAR1 independent of receptor cleavage and thrombin. The cognate P1′-P6′ peptides of other PARs have been useful as agonists for probing the role of these receptors in various cellular responses (3.Hung D.T. Vu T.-K.H. Nelken N.A. Coughlin S.R. J.

U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9208-9212Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). The importance of platelet activation in myocardial infarction and other thrombotic diseases has prompted considerable focus on identifying the PARs that mediate platelet activation by thrombin. Available data suggest that thrombin signaling in human platelets is mediated largely by hPAR1 and hPAR4 (8.Kahn M.L. Nakanishi-Matsui M. Shapiro M.J. Ishihara H. Coughlin S.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). PAR1 is necessary for platelet activation at low concentrations of thrombin, and PAR4 can mediate signaling at higher concentrations. The presence of two receptors raises the question of whether PAR1 and PAR4 are redundant, interact, or serve at least partially distinct functions in human platelets. In particular, it is possible that PAR4 might confer responsiveness to proteases other than thrombin. Platelet PARs may be exposed to a variety of proteases at sites of inflammation or coagulation, and leukocytes are one potential source. For example, neutrophils and platelets are both concentrated at sites of inflammation and thrombus formation. Moreover, aggregates of cells containing both neutrophils and platelets have been found in experimental models of inflammation or thrombosis, suggesting that interactions between these cell types may be physiologically relevant (9.Cerletti C. Evangelista V. Molino M. de Gaetano G. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 218-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Secreted platelet products act on neutrophils to stimulate adhesion, migration, and/or degranulation (10.Weksler B.B. Gallin J.I. Goldstein I.M. Synderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1988: 543-557Google Scholar). A role for neutrophil-derived factors acting on platelets is less well established, but interestingly, the neutrophil proteases cathepsin G and elastase have been shown to act on platelets (9.Cerletti C. Evangelista V. Molino M. de Gaetano G. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 218-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 11.LaRosa C.A. Rohrer M.J. Benoit S.E. Rodino L.J. Barnard M.R. Michelson A.D.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11636-11647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In particular, cathepsin G has been found to cause platelet secretion and aggregation ex vivo (11.LaRosa C.A. Rohrer M.J. Benoit S.E. Rodino L.J. Barnard M.R. Michelson A.D. J. Vasc. Surg. 1994; 19: 306-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 13.Molino M. Di Lallo M. de Gaetano G. Cerletti C. Biochem.

This activity was shown to be dependent upon the active site of cathepsin G, giving rise to the hypothesis that cathepsin G signaling was mediated by a PAR. Studies of PAR1 as a candidate cathepsin G receptor suggested that this receptor did not account for cathepsin G signaling in platelets (15.Selak M. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 16.Molino M. Blanchard N. Belmonte E. Tarver A.P. Abrams C. Hoxie J.A. Cerletti C. Brass L.F. J. Biol.

In the present study we demonstrate that cathepsin G activates PAR4 and that activation of human platelets by cathepsin G is mediated by this receptor. Additionally, we provide evidence that cathepsin G and PAR4 can mediate neutrophil-dependent platelet activationex vivo. Cathepsin G was obtained from Athens Research & Technology (Athens, GA). Thrombin was obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). Hirudin was purchased from Sigma, and PPACK was from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Human platelets were isolated from donor blood collected in 0.2 volume of citrate buffer. The first 1 ml drawn was discarded. Blood was centrifuged at 200 × g for 15 min to separate platelet-rich plasma, buffy coat, and erythrocytes. Platelets were then washed in buffer (134 mm NaCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, 2.9 mm KCl, 0.34 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm MgCl, 10 mm Hepes, 5 mm glucose, 0.3% bovine serum albumin) containing prostaglandin E1 (1 μm) and EDTA (10 mm) and then resuspended in buffer alone prior to use. Neutrophils were isolated from buffy coat of the same donor blood as platelets. The buffy coat was layered over 63 and 72% Percoll solutions and centrifuged for 30 min at 500 × g. The polymorphonuclear leukocyte layer was removed, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in platelet buffer. Agonist-dependent calcium mobilization in platelets and cell lines was measured after loading with 4 μg/ml Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C using a Hitachi F2000 fluorometer. For mixed cell experiments neutrophils (4 × 106/ml) and platelets (5 × 107/ml) were suspended together in a cuvette in the presence of 0.1 mm EGTA and 2.5 μg/ml cytochalasin B just prior to measurement. Agonist-induced platelet aggregation was measured using a Chrono-Log lumiaggregometer. Platelets suspended in the buffer described above under stirring conditions in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 were introduced to agonist, and change in light transmission was measured. FLAG epitope-tagged wild type and mutant PAR receptors were expressed in Xenopus oocytes following microinjection of appropriate cRNA. Responses to agonist stimulation were assessed as 45Ca release from radiolabeled oocytes as described previously (1.Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2683) Google Scholar). Relative expression levels of receptor expressed on the oocyte surface were determined using binding of M1 monoclonal antibodies. Lung fibroblasts derived from PAR1 null mice (17.Trejo J. Connolly A.J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21536-21541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and Rat1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% bovine calf serum at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 incubator. K i values were determined by titration of cathepsin G (6 nm) or thrombin (8.5 nm) with various ecotin concentrations (18.Yang S.Q. Craik C.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 1001-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was monitored by cleavage of the chromogenic cathepsin G substrateN-succinyl-alanyl-alanyl-prolyl-phenylalanyl-thiobenzyl ester (SynPep) and the chromogenic thrombin substrate Spectrozyme-TH (American Diagnostica). The apparent K i for cathepsin G was determined by non-linear regression analysis of the data fit to an equation derived for kinetics of reversible tight binding inhibitors (19.Morrison J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 185: 269-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 20.Williams J.W. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 437-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). The apparent K i for thrombin was determined by linear regression analysis of the data fit to an equation derived for Michaelis-Menten kinetics of competitive inhibitors. Cathepsin G is a neutral serine protease found in neutrophil azurophilic granules and is released upon stimulation of cells by chemotactic agents such asN-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) or platelet-activating factor (21.Owen C.A. Campbell E.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 137-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The protease is known to hydrolyze matrix components such as laminin and fibronectin after methionine, leucine, phenylalanine, lysine, or arginine residues. The ability of this protease to activate platelets in a manner dependent upon protease activity prompted us to explore the possibility that cathepsin G might activate one or more of the known PARs. For sensitivity, we first sought responses in Xenopus oocytes overexpressing the various PARs. Cathepsin G purified from human neutrophils triggered consistent calcium signaling in Xenopus oocytes expressing human PAR1 or PAR4 (Fig. 1). This response was not the result of thrombin contamination in the cathepsin G preparation; thrombin inhibitors such as hirudin or PPACK did not prevent receptor activation by cathepsin G but did block activation by thrombin (Fig. 2). By contrast, the macromolecular serine protease inhibitor, ecotin (18.Yang S.Q. Craik C.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 1001-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), blocked cathepsin G-induced calcium responses but had no effect on thrombin. The apparent K i for inhibition of cathepsin G by wild type ecotin was determined to be 15 ± 6 pm,whereas the K i for the inhibition of thrombin was 1.1 ± 0.2 μm. This gives ecotin a specificity index of 73,000 in favor of blocking cathepsin G and not thrombin.Figure 2Effect of thrombin and serine protease inhibitors on thrombin and cathepsin G-induced 45Ca release from Xenopus oocytes. Oocytes expressing human PAR1 or PAR4 were stimulated with 10 nm thrombin (A) or 100 nm cathepsin G (B) in the absence or presence of the thrombin inhibitors, PPACK (1 μm), hirudin (10 units/ml), or ecotin (500 nm). Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of duplicate determinations. This experiment was replicated three times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cells expressing a mutant PAR1 in which alanine was substituted for phenylalanine at position 2 of the agonist peptide failed to respond to either thrombin or cathepsin G but did respond to SFLLRN (Fig.3). Similarly, a PAR4 mutant with a glycine to proline mutation at position 1 of the agonist peptide rendered the receptor uncleavable by thrombin or cathepsin G but still responsive to the PAR4-activating peptide AYPGKF. Thus activation of PAR1 and PAR4 by cathepsin G and thrombin almost certainly occurs by the same mechanism, unmasking of the respective tethered ligands by cleavage at the Arg41–Ser42 peptide bond in PAR1 and the Arg47–Gly48 peptide bond in PAR4. Cathepsin G also activated PAR1 and PAR4 stably expressed in mammalian cells. A previously described fibroblast cell line derived from PAR1 knockout mice was transfected to stably express FLAG epitope-tagged hPAR1 or hPAR4 (17.Trejo J. Connolly A.J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21536-21541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Cathepsin G (100 nm) triggered increases in cytoplasmic calcium in PAR1-transfected cells (Fig.4). Cells transfected with PAR4 required 500 nm cathepsin G to produce a similar response. No response was detected in untransfected cells. Similar results were observed in transfected Rat1 fibroblasts expressing PAR1 and PAR4 (data not shown). Thus, cathepsin G can activate PAR1 and PAR4 in mammalian cell expression systems. These results raised the possibility that PAR1 and/or PAR4 might mediate cathepsin G activation of human platelets. Cathepsin G (500 nm) triggered both aggregation and robust increases in cytoplasmic calcium in washed human platelets (Figs.5 and 6). The roles of PAR1 and PAR4 in this response were first examined by desensitization studies. Platelets preincubated with the PAR1-activating peptide SFLLRN (100 μm) for 30 min failed to respond to subsequent challenge with SFLLRN but did respond to cathepsin G (Fig. 5 E). By contrast, platelets preincubated with the PAR4-activating peptide AYPGKF (100 μm) 2T. Faruqi, E. Weiss, and S. Coughlin, submitted for publication. were refractory to stimulation with cathepsin G but did respond robustly to SFLLRN (Fig. 5 F). These desensitization studies suggest that signaling via PAR4 but not PAR1 is required for cathepsin G responses in human platelets.Figure 6Cathepsin G-induced platelet aggregation. Aggregation induced by 1 μm cathepsin G was tested in naı̈ve platelets (A) and platelets treated with 100 μm BMS200261 (B) or 1 mg/ml PAR4-blocking antibody (C). Platelets treated with BMS200261 were unresponsive to 100 μm SFLLRN (not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A PAR4-blocking antibody and a PAR1-specific antagonist were also used to probe the roles of PAR1 and PAR4 in platelet responses to cathepsin G. Activation of PAR1 by thrombin or SFLLRN can be blocked with BMS200261 (22.Bernatowicz M.S. Klimas C.E. Hartl K.S. Peluso M. Allegretto N.J. Seiler S.M. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 4879-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), a peptide-based antagonist that does not block PAR4 activation (8.Kahn M.L. Nakanishi-Matsui M. Shapiro M.J. Ishihara H. Coughlin S.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Similarly, a polyclonal antibody raised to a receptor peptide that spans the thrombin cleavage site of PAR4 blocks cleavage and activation of the receptor by thrombin. Because the antiserum works by blocking cleavage, it does not block PAR4 activation by AYPGKF. Treatment of platelets with the PAR1 antagonist BMS200261 blocked calcium mobilization and aggregation in response to SFLLRN but not cathepsin G (Figs. 5 B and 6). By contrast, presence of the antibody to PAR4 effectively blocked the cathepsin G-triggered platelet responses but not responses to AYPGKF or SFLLRN (Figs. 5 C,6, and data not shown). Pre-immune rabbit IgG was without effect (Fig.5 D), and the specificity of the PAR4 antibody for blockade of PAR4 but not PAR1 was reported previously (8.Kahn M.L. Nakanishi-Matsui M. Shapiro M.J. Ishihara H. Coughlin S.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). These data strongly suggest that activation of PAR4 but not PAR1 is necessary for activation of platelets by cathepsin G. These data are concordant with previous studies concluding that cathepsin G does not activate platelets via PAR1 (15.Selak M. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 16.Molino M. Blanchard N. Belmonte E. Tarver A.P. Abrams C. Hoxie J.A. Cerletti C. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11168-11175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Molinoet al. (16.Molino M. Blanchard N. Belmonte E. Tarver A.P. Abrams C. Hoxie J.A. Cerletti C. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11168-11175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) showed that cathepsin G could cleave PAR1 either productively at the Arg41–Ser42 peptide bond or non-productively at the Phe55–Trp56 peptide bond in the PAR1 amino-terminal exodomain. The latter cleavage served to remove the PAR1 tethered ligand rendering it unresponsive to thrombin although still responsive to SFLLRN. In the context of the model that PAR1 and PAR4 mediate platelet activation by thrombin (8.Kahn M.L. Nakanishi-Matsui M. Shapiro M.J. Ishihara H. Coughlin S.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar), this observation predicts that if PAR4 function were inhibited, cathepsin G might actually block platelet activation by thrombin. Accordingly, platelets were first desensitized with the PAR4 agonist AYPGKF and then challenged with thrombin or cathepsin G. As expected, thrombin induced a response, presumably via PAR1, whereas cathepsin G elicited no response (Fig. 5, G and H). After both desensitization with AYPGKF and exposure to cathepsin G, platelets became refractory to thrombin but still responded to SFLLRN (Fig.5 H). Taken together, these data are consistent with the model that cathepsin G cleaves PAR1 at two (or more) sites (16.Molino M. Blanchard N. Belmonte E. Tarver A.P. Abrams C. Hoxie J.A. Cerletti C. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11168-11175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), with a small fraction of cleavage events occurring at the activating site but the majority occurring at the inhibitory site(s). Signaling responses to cathepsin G in cultured cells that express high levels of PAR1 (Fig.4) are perhaps due to cleavage of a small fraction, but still adequate absolute number, of receptors at the activating site. The absent PAR1-mediated thrombin signaling but retained responsiveness to SFLLRN in cathepsin-treated platelets is likely due to cleavage of the majority of receptors at the inhibitory site. In cell suspensions containing both neutrophils and platelets, the neutrophil agonist fMLP induces activation of platelets, presumably by release of cathepsin G from neutrophil azurophilic granules (23.Del Maschio A. Evangelista V. Rajtar G. Chen Z.M. Cerletti C. de Gaetano G. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: H870-H879PubMed Google Scholar). This model predicts that, in such a mixed cell system, fMLP-triggered platelet activation should be PAR4-dependent. To test this prediction, washed human platelets were loaded with Fura-2 and mixed with neutrophils isolated from the same donor prior to measurement of calcium mobilization (Fig. 7). Stimulation with fMLP (100 nm) resulted in reproducible increases in cytoplasmic calcium in Fura-2-loaded platelets. Addition of fMLP to platelets alone did not induce an observable signal (data not shown). Pretreatment of platelets with the PAR4-blocking antibody but not pre-immune IgG prevented platelet activation in the mixed cell experiment. These data strongly suggest that, in this system, neutrophil-dependent platelet activation is mediated by the action of cathepsin G on platelet PAR4. In summary, this study strongly suggests that PAR4 is the “cathepsin G receptor” on human platelets and that activation of PAR4 by cathepsin G is necessary for neutrophil-dependent platelet activation in the above studies. The importance of cathepsin G-induced platelet activation in vivo is unknown. The ratio of neutrophils to platelets required to achieve robust neutrophil-dependent platelet calcium mobilization was approximately 1/12, one-half to one log higher than that likely to be achieved in whole blood. However, endothelial cells that have been activated by thrombin or cytokines bind neutrophils and platelets, thereby concentrating both at sites of inflammation and thrombosis. In addition, shear stress alone can induce neutrophil-platelet aggregates. Such mechanisms presumably create microenvironments that favor neutrophil-platelet interactions (see below). In this regard, minimal-free cathepsin G is detectable in solution after neutrophil stimulation, and like many other proteases including thrombin, cathepsin G is inhibited by circulating protease inhibitors (11.LaRosa C.A. Rohrer M.J. Benoit S.E. Rodino L.J. Barnard M.R. Michelson A.D. J. Vasc. Surg. 1994; 19: 306-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 24.Owen C.A. Campbell M.A. Boukedes S.S. Campbell E.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5803-5810PubMed Google Scholar). However, a significant proportion of cathepsin G released by neutrophils remains bound to the extracellular membrane where it is catalytically active and relatively resistant to inactivation by protease inhibitors (24.Owen C.A. Campbell M.A. Boukedes S.S. Campbell E.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5803-5810PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Owen C.A. Campbell M.A. Sannes P.L. Boukedes S.S. Campbell E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 775-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 26.Evangelista V. Rajtar G. de Gaetano G. White J.G. Cerletti C. Blood. 1991; 77: 2379-2388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus platelet activation might be induced by neutrophil-bound, rather than fluid-phase, cathepsin G via direct cell-cell contact (27.Evangelista V. Piccardoni P. White J.G. de Gaetano G. Cerletti C. Blood. 1993; 81: 2947-2957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, when P-selectin antibodies were used to block the formation of neutrophil-platelet aggregates, neutrophil-dependent platelet activation became more sensitive to inhibition by protease inhibitors (27.Evangelista V. Piccardoni P. White J.G. de Gaetano G. Cerletti C. Blood. 1993; 81: 2947-2957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus microenvironments created at sites of thrombosis or inflammation may provide a setting where close proximity or direct contact of activated neutrophils and platelets allows cathepsin G-mediated activation of platelet PAR4 to occur. Given that activation of platelet PAR4 by neutrophil cathepsin Gin vivo is plausible, it is worth speculating on what roles this phenomenon might play. A link between inflammation and coagulation is well established and occurs at multiple levels. Pertinent to the present study, endothelial activation promotes both neutrophil and platelet adhesion and rolling via stimulation of von Willebrand factor release and P-selectin expression on the endothelial surface (28.Subramaniam M. Frenette P.S. Saffaripour S. Johnson R.C. Hynes R.O. Wagner D.D. Blood. 1996; 87: 1238-1242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Frenette P.S. Mayadas T.N. Rayburn H. Hynes R.O. Wagner D.D. Cell. 1996; 84: 563-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 30.Hattori R. Hamilton K.K. Fugate R.D. McEver R.P. Sims P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7768-7771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Norman K.E. Moore K.L. McEver R.P. Ley K. Blood. 1995; 86: 4417-4421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus endothelial activation provides a mechanism to concentrate platelets and neutrophils at the same site, perhaps promoting neutrophil-platelet interaction in the setting of graded local inflammatory responses. Interactions between marginated neutrophils and rolling platelets might become especially prominent in the setting of profound endothelial activation as occurs in the Shwartzman reaction (32.Brozna J.P. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1990; 16: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and related systemic phenomena associated with sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation. In the local Shwartzman reaction, for example, a cytokine stimulus at an endotoxin-primed skin site triggers robust margination of neutrophils and microvascular thrombosis within 15 min. Whether interrupting platelet-neutrophil interactions would be beneficial in such settings is unknown. The foregoing discussion casts neutrophil-platelet interactions as proinflammatory and/or prothrombotic. That is, activated neutrophils might induce platelet activation as a means of further promoting inflammatory cell recruitment by causing release of platelet cytokines (10.Weksler B.B. Gallin J.I. Goldstein I.M. Synderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1988: 543-557Google Scholar), stimulating thrombin generation via platelet procoagulant activity (thereby further activating the endothelium locally), or perhaps inciting local thrombosis to isolate a site of infection. Similarly, activated neutrophils might bind and activate platelets as a means of promoting their own incorporation into nascent thrombi at sites of injury. Conversely, it is conceivable that activated neutrophils might bind and activate platelets as part of a shutoff mechanism that limits the systemic effects of local inflammation by preventing activated neutrophils from circulating. Experimental models of inflammation in mice may provide a means of testing these hypotheses. Cathepsin G-deficient mice showed only a mildly augmented inflammatory response during wound healing but were otherwise without apparent phenotype, suggesting that cathepsin G activation of platelet PAR4 is not necessary for survival in an unstressed setting (33.Abbott R.E. Corral C.J. MacIvor D.M. Lin X. Ley T.J. Mustoe T.A. Arch. Surg. 1998; 133: 1002-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Clearly, multiple ligand-receptor systems regulate inflammatory and thrombotic responses, and whether deficiencies in other pathways that serve redundant functions might unmask an important role for neutrophil cathepsin G is unknown. Moreover, as noted above, activation of platelets by neutrophil cathepsin G may become important only at sites where activated neutrophils and platelets are substantially concentrated, and the effect of cathepsin G deficiency in models that might engender interactions, such as the Shwartzman reaction, between activated neutrophils and platelets has not been reported. Further study of relevant models of inflammation or thrombosis in cathepsin G-deficient mice, PAR4-deficient mice, and perhaps mice in which these deficiencies are combined with others, will be useful for probing the significance of this interaction between neutrophils and platelets. In addition to describing cathepsin G activation of PAR4 as a possible pathway for neutrophil-dependent platelet activation, this study makes the general point that PARs that were originally described as thrombin receptors may also confer responsiveness to proteases other than thrombin (1.Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2683) Google Scholar, 4.Nystedt S. Emilsson K. Wahlestedt C. Sundelin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

The differential importance of PAR1versus PAR4 for thrombin versus cathepsin G signaling in human platelets supports the notion that these receptors may serve, at least in part, distinct roles. Thus PAR4 might serve not only to mediate thrombin responsiveness; it might expand the platelet's repertoire by mediating responses to other proteases."
https://openalex.org/W1972535275,"In studying biological roles of interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1 tumor suppressor in cervical carcinogenesis, we found that HPV E7 is functionally associated with IRF-1. Binding assays indicate a physical interaction between IRF-1 and HPV E7in vivo and in vitro. The carboxyl-terminal transactivation domain of IRF-1 was required for the interaction. Transient co-expression of E7 significantly inhibits the IRF-1-mediated activation of IFN-β promoter in NIH-3T3 cells. Co-transfection of E7 mutants reveals that the pRb-binding portion of E7 is necessary for the E7-mediated inactivation of IRF-1. It was next determined whether histone deacetylase (HDAC) is involved in the inactivation mechanism as recently suggested, where the carboxyl-terminal zinc finger domain of E7 associates with NURD complex containing HDAC. When trichostatin A, an inhibitor of HDAC, was treated, the repressing activity of E7 was released in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the mutation of zinc finger abrogates such activity without effect on the interaction with IRF-1. These results suggest that HPV E7 interferes with the transactivation function of IRF-1 by recruiting HDAC to the promoter.

Adv. Cancer Res. 1987; 48: 113-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Of known HPV subtypes to date, high-risk HPV-16 and HPV-18 are frequently detected in malignant tumors and associated with 70% of all cervical carcinomas (2.zur Hausen H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1288: F55-F78Crossref PubMed Scopus (1490) Google Scholar). In contrast, low-risk HPV-6 and HPV-11 are associated with benign genital warts and are very rarely detected in tumors. The malignant phenotype of high-risk types depends on the expression of two viral oncogenes, E6 and E7. A number of genetic and biochemical studies have shown that E6 and E7 proteins cooperatively exert cellular immortality and transformation by interfering with the functions of the cellular tumor suppressor proteins, p53 and pRb, respectively (3.Mansur C.P. Androphy E.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 323-345PubMed Google Scholar). Of two HPV oncoproteins, E7 is the major transforming protein and is structurally and functionally similar to adenovirus E1A and simian virus T antigen. Based on the similarity, E7 can be divided into three domains: the amino-terminal conserved region 1 (CR1), CR2 containing LXCXE motif, and the carboxyl-terminal zinc fingers (CR3). Functionally, the CR2 portion of E7 associates with the hypophosphorylated form of pRb and interferes with its binding to E2F. The binding leads to the release of E2F from the pRb-E2F complex, which subsequently activates genes essential for progression through late G1 and S phase, including those necessary for the DNA replication, cell cycle regulation, and proto-oncogenes c-myc and B-myb (4.Jensen-Durr P. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 270-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In addition to these features of E7, other or additional activities have been reported that are independent of pRb in the course of cellular transformation. For example, the pRb binding-defective mutant of E7 still exerts immortality to primary human genital epithelial cells by cooperating with E6 (5.Jewers R.J. Hildebrandt P. Ludlow J.W. Kell B. McCane D.J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1329-1335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, deletion mutants of either CR1 or the carboxyl-terminal region of E7 markedly reduce its transforming capacity, although still forming a complex with pRb (6.Brokaw J.L. Yee C.L. Munger K. Virology. 1994; 205: 603-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 7.Huang P.S. Patrick D.R. Edwards G. Goodhart P.J. Huber H.E. Miles L. Garsky V.M. Oliff A. Heimbrook D.C. Mol. Cell.

Most recently, it has been shown that the carboxyl-terminal zinc finger domain of HPV-16 E7 associates with histone deacetylase (HDAC)1 through the direct interaction with Mi2β, a component of the NURD complex (9.Brehm A. Nielsen S.J. Miska E.A. McCance D.J. Reid J.L. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2449-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the interaction was implicated in the transcriptional repression of E7 by recruiting HDAC to the promoter of a specific gene, although either target transcription factor or gene was not identified yet, which is absolutely important for the physiological role of the interaction. These findings collectively suggest that the pRb-independent activities of E7 may be involved in transformation of target cells. Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), originally identified as an interferon (IFN)-β promoter binding transcription factor, has been implicated for a critical mediator of IFN signaling, when induced by various stimuli such as the viral infection, IFNs, retinoic acids, prolactin, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) (10.Taniguchi T. Lamphier M.S. Tanaka N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: M9-M17Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been reported that IRF-1 overexpression inhibits cell growth (11.Kirchhoff S. Schaper F. Hauser H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2881-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and that introduction of activated c-Ha-ras oncogene alone is sufficient to transform embryo fibroblasts from IRF-1−/− mice (12.Tanaka N. Ishihara M. Kitagawa M. Harada H. Kimura T. Mastuyama T. Lamphier M.S. Aizawa S. Mak T.W. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1994; 77: 829-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the IRF-1 gene is a tumor suppressor gene that may be associated with the antiproliferative effect of IFNs. Many viral pathogens have evolved various strategies for inhibiting the expression of immune-modulating molecules on infected cells to avoid T lymphocyte attack (13.Ploegh H.L. Science. 1998; 280: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Adenovirus E1A, homologous to HPV E7, has been demonstrated to inhibit the expression of MCP-1 at the transcriptional level (14.Timmers H.T. van Dam H. Pronk G.J. Bos J.L. Van der Eb A.J. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 1470-1473Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, TAP-1 promoter activity is down-regulated in oncogenic adenovirus 12-transformed cell (15.Proffitt J.A. Blair G.E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Recently, it also has been reported that HPV-16 E6 binds to the carboxyl-terminal transactivation domain of IRF-3, another member of the IRF family, and inactivates its transactivation function (16.Ronco L.V. Karpova A.Y. Vidal M. Howley P.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2061-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Therefore, it could be speculated that HPV E6 or E7 oncoprotein might interfere with IFN signaling, and thus lead to evading host immunity in the progress of cervical carcinogenesis. To see whether IRF-1 is a cellular target of HPV E7 oncoprotein involved in the perturbation of host IFN signaling, we performed a cellular interaction assay. GST pull-down assay confirmed that IRF-1 could directly interact with HPV-16 E7, which was initially demonstrated by yeast and mammalian two-hybrid assays in vivo. We further show that HPV E7 abrogates the transactivation function of IRF-1 by direct interaction, not by its targeting for degradation. Studies with HDAC inhibitor and E7 mutants suggest that the transrepression activity of E7 be mediated by recruiting HDAC to the IFN-β promoter through the interaction with IRF-1, and that the pRb-binding portion (CR2) of E7 is necessary, but needs additional zinc finger region (CR3) for the sufficient suppression. Our novel finding could improve the understanding of the molecular basis of immune evasion strategy used by the HPV E7 in cervical carcinogenesis.

IRF-1 expression plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Tucker Collins (Boston, MA) and modified by re-cloning into yeast vectors for two-hybrid assay and pSG5 vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for transient cotransfection assay. IFN-β-CAT reporter plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. J. Hiscott (Quebec, Canada). Expression plasmids for GST-E7 and E7 mutants were kindly provided by Drs. S. H. Kee (Chuncheon, Korea) and D. A. Galloway (Seattle, WA), respectively. Gal4-E7 fusion protein was expressed from a pG4M-polyII vector (19.Tora L. White J. Brou C. Tasset D. Webster N. Scheer E. Chambon P. Cell. 1989; 59: 477-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). This assay was done as described previously (20.vom Baur E. Harbers M. Um S.-J. Benecke A. Chambon P. Losson R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1278-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNA sequence of IRF-1 was introduced into the vector pBTM116, while cDNA sequences of HPV-16 E7, −11 E7, −16 E6, and −16 E6/E7 were introduced into the vector pASV3. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae L40 strain (MATa,his3Δ200, trp1–901, leu2–3, 112,ade2, LYS::(lexAop)4-HIS3, URA3::(lexAop)8-lacZ) (a gift from S. M. Hollenberg, Dept. of Cell and Developmental Biology, Oregon Health Sciences University) (17.Vojtek B.A. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar) was transformed with a pBTM116 plasmid and a pASV3 plasmid one by one by the lithium-acetate procedure (21.Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 155-159Google Scholar). Transformants were grown in 15 ml of minimal liquid medium supplemented with histidine (50 mg/liter) and adenine (20 mg/liter). Extracts were prepared by a freezing-thawing lysis technique (22.Schneider S. Buchert M. Hovens C.M. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 960-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and analyzed for β-galactosidase activity according to a standard procedure (21.Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 155-159Google Scholar), except that reactions were performed in 96-well plates. To confirm the interaction in the mammalian cell, transient transfections were performed in NIH-3T3 cells using (17 mer)5 TATA-CAT reporter plasmid, Gal4 (DBD)-E7, and VP16 (AD)-IRF-1 expression vectors. Fold stimulation was calculated by dividing the amount of CAT enzyme, determined by CAT ELISA, of Gal4- and VP16-treated cells by that of Gal4-control cells. In vitro binding studies using GST-fused E7 were performed as described with a little modification (23.Um S.J. Harbers M. Benecke A. Pierrat B. Losson R. Chambon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20728-20736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Briefly, GST or GST-E7 proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli and purified on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Wild type IRF-1 was in vitrotranslated in 50 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) supplemented with [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Glutathione-Sepharose beads were equilibrated with binding buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 μm ZnCl2, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Nonidet-40). An approximately equimolar amount of GST (0.5 μg) or GST-E7 (1 μg) was mixed with 15 μl of 35S-IRF-1, and the mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Pre-equilibrated glutathione-Sepharose beads were added and further incubation was allowed for 1 h. The beads were washed three times with the binding buffer. Bound proteins were detected by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Either 15 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled IRF-1 synthesized in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysate was mixed with GST (0.5 μg) or GST-E7 (1 μg) in the presence of 1× phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 2 mm dithiothreitol. The reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature. At various times, aliquots were removed, mixed with an equal volume of 2× SDS-loading buffer, and analyzed by autoradiography. Transfection of cells was carried out by CaPO4/DNA precipitation as described (24.Durand B. Saunders M. Gaudon C. Roy B. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1994; 22: 5370-5382Crossref Scopus (316) Google Scholar). NIH-3T3 cells (∼106), maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, were plated in 60-mm dishes 5 h before transfection. Total amounts (6 μg) of transfected DNA including SV40-driven β-galactosidase internal control plasmid were kept constant by including the respective control plasmids without insertions as indicated. After overnight transfection, cells were washed, fed with the complete medium, and further incubated for 24 h. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, collected, resuspended in 100 μl of 0.25m Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), and subjected to three free-thaw cycles. Samples were cleared by centrifugation (12,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C), and protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent. 30–70 μl of the clear lysates was tested for CAT concentration in the CAT ELISA according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). The CAT concentration of each sample was normalized with respect to β-galactosidase activity. All the data presented in the text represent the mean of at least three independent transfections. Fold stimulation was calculated by dividing the amount of CAT enzyme of treated cells by that of untreated cells. The interaction in vivo between HPV E7 and IRF-1 was analyzed by the yeast two-hybrid assays for which full-length IRF-1 was fused to the LexA DNA-binding domain, and HPV E7 was fused to the VP16 acidic activation domain. Because the yeast strain L40 contains a lacZ reporter gene driven by eight LexA binding sites, the interaction can be quantified by a simple β-galactosidase assay. As shown in Fig.1 A, we observed that LexA-fused IRF-1 harbors intrinsic transcriptional activity when compared with LexA without fusion. When both LexA-fused IRF-1 and VP16-fused HPV-16 E7 were introduced, an ∼5-fold increase of β-galactosidase activity was observed, indicating that E7 interacts with IRF-1 in yeast cells. However, no interaction was detected when VP16-E6 was introduced, and the expression of E6 did not influence the interaction between E7 and IRF-1. Reversed experiments to confirm above results could not be carried out because the expression of VP16-fused IRF-1 was toxic to the yeast L40. Deletion of the carboxyl-terminal transactivation domain (amino acid residues 167–325) of IRF-1 abolished the interaction (Fig. 1 B). Interestingly, the carboxyl-terminal domain of IRF-1 was found to interact with both high-risk HPV-16 and low-risk HPV-11, suggesting that E7 interacts with IRF-1 without type-specificity of HPV. To determine whether the interaction is direct, we performed anin vitro binding assay for which GST or GST-E7 protein was induced in E. coli and purified and then mixed with in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled IRF-1 in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Binding of E7 to IRF-1 was assessed by GST pull-down assay. As shown in Fig. 1 C, about 10% of input IRF-1 protein was retained on the E7-conjugated Sepharose beads, confirming that IRF-1 binding to HPV E7 is direct in vitro. Because E7 antibody is not so available for immunoprecipitation that is frequently used to demonstrate that the interaction is physiological in mammalian cells, we instead carried out a mammalian two-hybrid assay. When Gal4-E7 or VP16-IRF-1 alone was expressed in NIH-3T3 cells, the expression of CAT reporter gene was marginal. However, the CAT expression was increased to 3.5-fold by coexpression of Gal4-E7 and VP16-IRF-1 (Fig. 1 D), suggesting that the interaction is physiological in vivo. Given the physical interaction between E7 and IRF-1 as described, we next measured the effect of E7 expression on the transcriptional activity of IRF-1 in NIH-3T3 cells using an IFN-β promoter-CAT gene construct. Expression of IRF-1 resulted in up-regulated transcription from this promoter, and co-expression of HPV-16 E7 inhibited the IRF-1-directed activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.2). As expected from the interaction assays, low risk HPV-11 E7 also abrogated the transactivation function of IRF-1, indicating that HPV-11 also needs to inactivate host immunity presented by IRF-1 for the formation of a benign tumor such as a genital wart. To determine that the pRb-binding LXCXE motif of E7 is responsible for the inactivation of IRF-1, two deletion mutants of E7 were used for transfection and binding assays. As depicted in Fig.3 A, Δ6–10 is a transformation-defective mutant without affect to pRb binding and Δ21–24 (LXCXE motif) is completely defective for pRb binding as well as transformation (25.Demers G.W. Espling E. Harry J.B. Etscheid B.G. Galloway D.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6862-6869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Coexpression of wild type E7 abolished the transactivation function of IRF-1 in a dose-dependent manner. However, Δ6–10 and Δ21–24 mutants showed little repression and no repression against IRF-1 activity, respectively (Fig. 3 B). This result suggests that either pRb mediates the repressing activity of E7 or, more directly, the region of E7 is required for interaction with IRF-1. Yeast two-hybrid assay was performed to demonstrate that the pRb-binding portion of E7 is critical for the interaction with IRF-1. As shown in Fig. 3 C, the repression-defective Δ21–24 mutant was not capable of interacting with IRF-1. E7 Δ6–10, a weakly repressing mutant, showed little binding activity to IRF-1. These results suggest that the repression activity of E7 be correlated to the binding of E7 to IRF-1. Therefore, it is likely that the CR1/2 containing pRb-binding portion of E7 is functionally important for mediating E7-directed transrepression of IRF-1 function through the direct protein-protein interaction. To determine how HPV E7 inactivates the transactivation function of IRF-1, we performed three independent assays. From in vitro degradation assay and gel mobility shift assay, we could not observe any effects of E7 on the degradation and DNA binding activity of IRF-1, respectively (data not shown). Finally, when we treated TSA, an inhibitor of HDAC, to the cells transfected with E7 and IRF-1 expression vectors and IFN-β promoter CAT reporter, we found that the E7-mediated repression of IRF-1 activity was released in a dose-dependent manner of TSA (Fig. 4). Based on the report that HPV E7 is functionally associated with transcriptional repression NuRD complex containing HDAC, our observations suggest that IRF-1 could be one of repression target of HPV E7. To further confirm these results, we analyzed E7 mutants that are mutated in the carboxyl-terminal zinc finger domain. It has been reported that C58G/C91G mutant is defective in recruiting HDAC, whereas S71I mutant is not (Fig.5 A) (9.Brehm A. Nielsen S.J. Miska E.A. McCance D.J. Reid J.L. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2449-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). As expected, both mutants are able to interact with IRF-1, probably through the amino-terminal pRb-binding domain (Fig. 5 B). However, the transcription assays indicate that C58G//C91G mutant loses its repressing activity, but S71I is still capable of repressing IRF-1 function (Fig. 5 C). These results indicate that the carboxyl-terminal zinc finger domain of E7 is required for the E7-mediated repression of IRF-1, probably by recruiting HDAC to IRF-1 response region.Figure 5The carboxyl-terminal Zn finger domain of HPV-16 E7 is required for the repression of IRF-1. A, the structure of HPV-16 E7 protein, where two Zn finger mutants of E7 were shown. C58G/C91G mutant is defective in recruiting HDAC (9.Brehm A. Nielsen S.J. Miska E.A. McCance D.J. Reid J.L.

However, recent evidence has indicated that inactivation of pRb is necessary but not sufficient for transformation (5.Jewers R.J. Hildebrandt P. Ludlow J.W. Kell B. McCane D.J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1329-1335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Brokaw J.L. Yee C.L. Munger K. Virology. 1994; 205: 603-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 7.Huang P.S. Patrick D.R. Edwards G.

Virol. 1993; 67: 2404-2407Google Scholar), suggesting that in addition to pRb, another cellular target of E7 is required for its full transforming activity. As depicted in Fig.6, our results could indicate pRb-independent function of E7 in two aspects: (i) E7 interacts with the carboxyl-terminal transactivation domain of IRF-1 and inactivates its transactivation function; (ii) inactivation requires both the amino-terminal domain of E7, including pRb-binding pocket, for binding to IRF-1 and the carboxyl-terminal zinc finger for recruiting HDAC independent of pRb. Recently, it has been shown that HPV-16 E7 functionally associates with HDAC and thus represses transcription. However, it is necessary that any target transcription factors or genes should be identified for the interaction to be physiologically relevant. Our data indicate that IRF-1 is a novel cellular target of E7 for transcriptional repression for which both domains of E7 are required. Furthermore, a mechanism underlying the inactivation is likely because of recruitment of HDAC by CR3 zinc finger domain of E7 to IRF-1. These overall suggestions might be physiologically related to the fact that both domains are essential for the complete transforming activity of HPV E7 in vivo. Immunity evasion is a process to be required for the progress of all malignant tumors. Both MHC molecules and TAP-1 are essential for the T lymphocyte recognition of antigen through the formation of MHC-peptide complexes (26.Germain R.N. Cell. 1994; 76: 287-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). MCP-1, a chemoattractant molecule, is responsible for the attraction of T lymphocyte to the target cells (27.Rollins B.J. Sunday M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3125-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Molecular epidemiological studies have suggested that HPV-caused development of cervical cancer might be closely related to the escape of host immune surveillance. In HPV-infected cervical cancer tissue, the expression of MHC class molecules and TAP-1 are markedly down-regulated (28.Cromme F.V. Meijer C.J. Snijders P.J. Uyterlinde A. Kenemans P. Helmerhorst T.

Kenemans P. Helmerhorst T.J. Stukart M.J. Meijer C.J. Br. J. Cancer. 1994; 69: 1176-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In addition, MCP-1 is much less expressed than in the stroma surrounding the carcinoma cells (30.Riethdorf L. Reithdorf S. Gutzlaff K. Prall F. Loning T. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 1469-1476PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Kleine-Lowinski K. Gillitzer R. Kuhne-Heid R. Rosl F. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 82: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These immune-modulator genes are transcriptionally induced either directly by IFN-activated STAT or indirectly by IFN-induced IRF-1 (32.Min W. Pober J.S. Johnson D.R. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3174-3183PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Hobart M. Ramassar V. Goes N. Urmson J. Halloran P.F. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4260-4269PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Chatterjee-Kishore M. Kishore R.

Immunol. 1998; 161: 3719-3728PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the inactivation of either STAT or IRF-1 could be one mechanism by which HPV escapes host immune surveillance. In agreement, some molecular evidence has been reported as followed. HPV-16 E6 binds to the carboxyl-terminal transactivation domain of IRF-3 and inhibits its transcriptional activity without targeting for proteasome-mediated degrading (16.Ronco L.V. Karpova A.Y. Vidal M. Howley P.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2061-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). IRF-3 is part of a virus-activated transcription factor, of which activity is increased in response to viral infection (37.Wathelet M. Lin C.H. Parekh B. Ronco L.V. Howley P.M. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 507-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar), and is involved in type I IFN gene expression (38.Schafer S.L. Lin R. Moore P.A. Hiscott J. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2714-2720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Recently, HPV-16 E7 has been implicated in immune evasion by inducing E7-specific cytotoxic T cell tolerance (39.Borchers A. Braspenning J. Meijer J. Osen W. Gissmann L. Jochmus I. Arch. Virol. 1999; 144: 1539-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and by abrogating IFN-α-mediated signaling (40.Barnard P. McMillan N.A. Virology. 1999; 259: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) although the molecular mechanism has not been clearly determined. In this study, we showed that HPV E7 physically interacts with IRF-1, which is critical for IFN signaling, and abrogates its transactivation function, probably through histone deacetylation. Therefore, our novel observation could contribute to elucidation of the molecular mechanism of E7-mediated immune evasion. However, the in vivoimplication of the inactivation remains to be determined. Detailed analysis of these works is currently under way in our laboratory, for example construction of tetracycline-inducible E7 expressing cell line. The functional inactivation of IRF-1 by both high-risk (HPV-16 and HPV-18) and low-risk HPV (HPV-6 and HPV-11) E7s could play an important role in the malignant transformation and benign condyloma formation of cervix, respectively. Once high-risk HPV infects, it produces E6 and E7 oncoproteins. Both inactivate two cellular tumor suppressor proteins by which E6 binds to p53 and promotes its proteolysis and E7 binds to hypophosphorylated form of pRb and interferes with its binding to E2F. Thus, the inactivation of IRF-1 tumor suppressor by high-risk E7 would provide another advantage to a cervical carcinogenesis. However, unlike pRb, IRF-1 could be inactivated by low-risk HPV-11 E7 as demonstrated in our assay. Although the physiological implication of such an observation is not clear at present, it is tempting to speculate that IRF-1 could be one of target growth regulators of low-risk E7 involved in the benign tumor formation such as a cervical condyloma. In this regard, the development of a peptide drug to break the E7-IRF-1 interaction could be used as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of malignant and benign cervical lesions."

We investigated the effects of external pH and Ca2+ on water permeability ofXenopus oocytes injected with aquaporin cRNA by measuring the rate of swelling in hypotonic solutions. Lowering pH to 6.5 increased the water permeability of aquaporin (AQP0) 3.4 ± 0.4-fold. Diethylpyrocarbonate pretreatment increased water permeability 4.2 ± 0.5-fold and abolished pH sensitivity, suggesting that the pH regulation is mediated by an external histidine. Lowering Ca2+ increased water permeability 4.1 ± 0.4-fold. The effects of Ca2+ and pH each required the presence of histidine 40, indicating a critical role of this amino acid in facilitating the modulation of water permeability. Clamping intracellular Ca2+ at high or low values abolished sensitivity to external Ca2+, suggesting that Ca2+ acts at an internal site. Three different calmodulin inhibitors each increased AQP0 water permeability, suggesting that Ca2+ may act through calmodulin. None of the above altered the water permeability induced by AQP1 or AQP4.

AQP4 (previously called MIWC for mercurial-insensitive water channel) is expressed strongly in the brain and kidney collecting duct (6.Jung J.S. Bhat R.V. Preston G.M. Guggino W.B. Baraban J.M.

Hall J.E. Ehring G.R. Simon S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2255-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). AQP0, AQP1, and AQP4 share ∼40% sequence identity with each other. Attempts to increase AQP0 water permeability by exchanging parts of AQP0 for corresponding parts of AQP1 have been ineffective (19.Mulders S.M. Van der Kemp A.J. Terlouw S.A. Van Boxtel H.A. Van Os C.H. Deen P.M. Pflugers. Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1998; 436: 599-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Although low in water permeability per molecule, AQP0 comprises more than 60% of the membrane protein in the normal vertebrate lens and therefore provides the major permeability pathway for water movement across the membranes of lens fiber cells. If it is defective or missing from an otherwise normal lens, a cataract results (20.Shiels A. Griffin C.S. Curr. Eye Res. 1993; 12: 913-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 21.Shiels A. Bassnett S. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 212-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In a chimeric mouse model, cataract can be prevented by the presence of 20% normal cells, which presumably supply the requisite AQP0 (22.Muggleton-Harris A.L. Hardy K. Higbee N. Development. 1987; 99: 473-480PubMed Google Scholar). The role of AQP0 in maintaining normal lens conditions is uncertain, but it likely facilitates the intrinsic circulation of fluid in the lens that maintains lens transparency and homeostasis in the absence of blood vessels (23.Mathias R.T. Rae J.L. Baldo G.J. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 21-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). pH and Ca2+ are likely candidates for effecting regulatory control of this circulation, because both of these ions seem to play important roles in the lens. The lens interior is more acidic (pH 6.5) than the surface (pH 7.02) (24.Mathias R.T. Riquelme G. Rae J.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 98: 1085-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 25.Pasquale L.R. Mathias R.T. Austin L.R. Brink P.R. Ciunga M. Biophys. J. 1990; 58: 939-945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and disturbances in Ca2+ concentration are associated with cataract (26.Duncan G. Jacob T.J.C. Nugent J. Whelan J. Human Cataract Formation. Pitman Press, Bath, UK1984: 132-152Google Scholar, 27.Paterson C.A. Zeng J. Husseini Z. Borchman D. Delamere N.A. Garland D. Jimenez-Asensio J. Curr.

In this paper we show that both pH and Ca2+ can regulate the water permeability of AQP0 expressed in Xenopus oocytes but not the water permeability of AQP1 or AQP4. We localize the molecular site of pH modulation to a single extracellular histidine, His40, unique to AQP0. Modulation of water permeability by local ionic changes within the lens interior may play an important role in lens physiology. Some of the results reported here were previously presented in abstract form (29.Cahalan K. Hall J.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 72Google Scholar, 30.Cahalan K.L. Hall J.E. Biophys. J. 1998; 76 (abstr.): 183Google Scholar). Female Xenopus laeviswere anesthetized, and stage V and VI oocytes removed and prepared as described previously (13.Chandy G. Zampighi G.A. Kreman M. Hall J.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 159: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The day after isolation, oocytes were injected with either 10 ng of AQP0 or 5 ng of AQP1 cRNA (except as noted) and maintained in ND96 (96 mm NaCl, 2 mmKCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) supplemented with 10 mg/ml penicillin, 10 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate at 18 °C. The expression constructs for bovine AQP0 and human AQP1 were gifts from Peter Agre and Greg Preston (Johns Hopkins). The rat AQP4 gene was purchased from ATCC (number 87184) and placed in the same expression vector. RNA was transcribed in vitro using T3 RNA polymerase (mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit, Ambion). Histidine was substituted by alanine, aspartate, or lysine at position 40 in AQP0, using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Briefly, the mutants were obtained by performing a one step polymerase chain reaction with a set of two appropriate primers overlapping in the region of the mutation using PfuTurbo DNA polymerase. The mutations were confirmed by sequencing using fluorescent dye terminators (University of Chicago, DNA Sequencing Facility). After 2 days, oocyte swelling assays were performed at 15 °C by transfer from 100% ND96 to 30% ND96. Before the transfer to 30% ND96 at the experimental pH or Ca2+ concentration, oocytes were always equilibrated for 5 min in 100% ND96 at the same experimental pH or Ca2+ concentration. Water permeability in cm/s,P f, was calculated as described previously from optical measurements of the increase in cross-sectional area of the oocyte with time in response to a challenge with diluted ND96 (13.Chandy G. Zampighi G.A. Kreman M. Hall J.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 159: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Because the water permeability of uninjected oocytes has a very high activation energy, about 25 kcal/mol, whereas the activation energy of the water permeability induced by the aquaporins is small, 4–8 kcal/mole (13.Chandy G. Zampighi G.A. Kreman M. Hall J.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 159: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 14.Mulders S.M. Preston G.M. Deen P.M. Guggino W.B. van Os C.H. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9010-9016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), a signal to noise advantage is obtained by performing these measurements at 15 °C rather than 20 °C. Unless otherwise noted, each data point is the average of experiments using nine oocytes from three different batches. Because AQP0 has a lower permeability than other aquaporins, we used relative permeability to facilitate comparison and to correct for background. We define relative water permeability as: relative Pf=Pexp−PctPst−PUIEquation 1 where P exp is the permeability measured under experimental conditions, P st is the permeability measured under standard conditions of pH 7.5, 1.8 mm Ca2+, and P UI is the permeability of uninjected oocytes. The standard error of relativeP f is calculated from the standard errors of the permeabilities using the usual formulae for the propagation of error (31.Bevington P.R. Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences. McGraw Hill, Inc., New York1969: 56-64Google Scholar). Under standard conditions, uninjected oocytes had an average water permeability of 4.5 ± 0.2 × 10−5 cm/s (n = 167) and showed no change in water permeability under any of the experimental conditions (changes in pH, Ca2+ concentration, DEPC modification, BAPTA, LPA, calmodulin inhibitors). We report a subset of these control data in Fig. 1 B, but we do not show the uninjected control results elsewhere. In addition, where appropriate, we show data for oocytes injected with AQP1 and AQP4, two different aquaporins whose water permeability does not change under the experimental conditions. For each experimental pH value, 100% and 30% ND96 solutions were made using HEPES for pH 8.0 to pH 7.0 and MES for pH 6.5 to pH 6.0. Before the swelling assay in 30% ND96 at the experimental pH, the oocytes were soaked in 100% ND96 at the experimental pH for 5 min. Oocytes were soaked in a freshly made DEPC solution (0.5 mm at pH 6.0) for 5 min. Then the oocytes were rinsed for 5 min at pH 6.0 to remove the excess DEPC. Finally the oocytes were rinsed for 5 min at pH 7.5, and the swelling assay was performed under appropriate experimental conditions. Oocytes were soaked in a solution of hydroxylamine (20 mm, pH 7.5) for 45 min and then rinsed in ND96, pH 7.5, for 5 min before performing the swelling assay. For each experimental Ca2+ concentration, 100% and 30% ND96 solutions were made as follows: 1 mm EGTA; no added Ca2+; 1.8 mm Ca2+ or 10 mm Ca2+. Before the swelling assay was performed in 30% ND96 at the experimental Ca2+ concentration, the oocytes were soaked in 100% ND96 at the experimental Ca2+ concentration for 5 min. 20 nl of 100 mm BAPTA (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid) were injected into the oocyte by pressure injection approximately 30 min before the swelling assays were performed. The final BAPTA concentration in the oocyte was about 2 mm. Oocytes were soaked in LPA solution (10 μm) for 3 min before performing the swelling assay in ND96 pH 7.5 with or without 1.8 mm Ca2+. Oocytes were soaked in 50 μm trifluoperazine, 5 μm calmidazolium, or 100 μm N-(6aminohexyl)-5chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide (W7), for 30 min in the dark before performing the swelling assay at pH 7.5, 1.8 mm Ca2+, with the inhibitor concentration maintained at the value specified above. We investigated the effects of varying external pH and [Ca2+] on the water permeability induced in oocytes by the lens-specific aquaporin, AQP0, and, for comparison, AQP1 and AQP4. Under standard external ionic conditions of pH 7.5 and 1.8 mmCa2+, the water permeability of AQP0 is much lower than that for AQP1. However, when pH is reduced, the water permeability of AQP0 acutely increases, whereas that of AQP1 and uninjected oocytes remains constant (Fig. 1 A). The relative permeability, calculated according to equation (1.Gorin M.B. Yancey S.B. Cline J. Revel J.P. Horwitz J. Cell. 1984; 39: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), is 3.4 ± 0.4 at pH 6.5 for AQP0. Fig. 1 B shows a titration curve for the water permeabilities of AQP0, AQP1, and uninjected oocytes plotted as relative permeabilities. The curve for AQP0 has an apparent pK a of slightly less than 7.0, a maximum water permeability at pH 6.5, and a minimum at pH 7.5. Permeability is not a monotonic function of pH but decreases as the pH is lowered below 6.0, suggesting the influence of at least one additional titratable site. This decrease toward the value of Pf found at pH 7.5 may explain why Zeuthen and Klaerke reported pH insensitivity of AQP0 by sampling only at pH 4.5 and 7.4 (32.Zeuthen T. Klaerke D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21631-21636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). These effects of pH on AQP0 water permeability were rapidly reversible within the length of time required to exchange solutions. The expression level of AQP0 has no effect on the pH sensitivity. Fig.1 C demonstrates the pH modulation for two different expression levels of AQP0, achieved by varying the amount of mRNA injected. In either case, lowering the pH to 6.5 increased the AQP0 water permeability by a factor of about three. To test whether the absolute level of water permeability might influence the pH sensitivity, we reduced the expression levels of AQP1 and AQP4 to produce levels of water permeability comparable with those seen with 10 ng of injected AQP0 cRNA. Fig. 1 D shows that even at reduced expression levels, no effects of pH on AQP1 or AQP4 water permeability were observed. We conclude that the water permeability of AQP0 is specifically increased by low pH and that this increase is not affected by either expression level or absolute level of water permeability. The pH dependence of AQP0 water permeability suggested the possible involvement of one or more histidine residues. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of DEPC on water permeability. DEPC can covalently modify histidine, lysine, or tyrosine amino acid side chains but preferentially modifies histidine when the reaction is carried out at pH 6.0. Also, the reaction with histidine, but not with lysine or tyrosine, can be reversed by hydroxylamine (33.Bell J.E. Bell E.T. Proteins and Enzymes. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1988Google Scholar). DEPC pretreatment increased relative P f to 4.2 ± 0.5 (compare Fig. 1 A with Fig.2 A). In addition, DEPC pretreatment completely abolished the pH sensitivity of the AQP0 water permeability (Fig. 2 A), indicating that few, if any, histidines remained unmodified. These results suggest that low pH and DEPC act at the same site or sites to increase AQP0 water permeability. The effects of DEPC on AQP0 water permeability were reversed by incubation with hydroxylamine (20 mm), confirming that the modified side chains are indeed histidines. Hydroxylamine pretreatment itself had no effect on the water permeability of AQP0-expressing oocytes (Fig. 2 A). Furthermore, DEPC pretreatment specifically increased the water permeability of AQP0, with no effect on the water permeability of AQP1-injected oocytes (Fig.2 B), AQP4-injected oocytes, or uninjected control oocytes (data not shown). From these chemical modification experiments, we conclude that a histidine residue or residues plays an essential role in pH modulation of AQP0 water permeability. Because the increase in water permeability induced by low pH was specific to AQP0 and not seen for AQP1 and AQP4, we examined the sequences of these aquaporins to search for candidate histidine residues. Fig. 3 shows the predicted membrane topology of AQP0, showing the NPA containing loops as folding back into the membrane as proposed by the hourglass model. AQP0 has a histidine residue in each extracellular loop (His40, His122, and His201). AQP1 has only the third, His201 (as His209), and AQP4 has the second and the third (as His129 and His208) (34.Misaka T. Abe K. Iwabuchi K. Kusakabe Y. Ichinose M. Miki K. Emori Y. Arai S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus His40 seemed the best candidate histidine. To test this hypothesis, we constructed three different mutants of AQP0, replacing His40 by alanine (H40A), aspartic acid (H40D), or lysine (H40K). Each of these mutants was functional, and although residues replacing His40 differed in size and charge, each exhibited water permeability under standard conditions approximately two times larger than that of wild type under comparable conditions of cRNA preparation and injection, and none exhibited pH-sensitive water permeability (Fig. 4 A). These experiments show that His40 plays an essential role in the pH sensitivity of the water permeability of wild-type AQP0.Figure 4Effect of pH and DEPC on AQP0 mutants water permeability. A, all three mutants H40A, H40D, and H40K expressed. Despite having different charges and sizes, all of the mutants had water permeabilities nearly equal to that of AQP0 at pH 6.5. But no mutant showed pH-sensitive water permeability.B, DEPC had no effect on the three histidine mutants. Unless otherwise indicated, each data point is the average of nine measurements (three different batches of oocytes, three oocytes from each batch). wt, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test for involvement of additional histidines, we investigated the effects of DEPC pretreatment on the three His40 mutants. Unlike wild-type AQP0, none of the mutants showed any change in water permeability with DEPC treatment (Fig. 4 B). We conclude that histidine at position 40 is necessary for the pH modulation of water permeability in AQP0. The histidines in the second and third extracellular loops are either inaccessible to modification by DEPC or have no functional effect in the modified form. pH and Ca2+ are often functionally linked in modulating properties of membrane transport proteins, and therefore we compared effects of varying extracellular [Ca2+] and pH separately and in combination. Nominally Ca2+-free solution at pH 7.5 increased relative AQP0 water permeability by a factor of 4.1 ± 0.4 (Fig. 5 A) but had no effect on the relative water permeability of AQP1-injected oocytes (Fig. 5 B), AQP4-injected oocytes, or uninjected control oocytes (data not shown). Similar to the effects of lowering pH, the increased water permeability induced by lowering Ca2+ was quickly restored upon return to standard ionic conditions. Addition of EGTA to chelate Ca2+ ions had a smaller effect than simply omitting Ca2+, suggesting a nonmonotonic Ca2+dependence analogous to that seen when pH was reduced below 6.0. Raising Ca2+ to 10 mm had no effect, compared with standard ionic conditions. Fig. 5 C demonstrates that varying the AQP0 water permeability over a wide range by varying the amount of cRNA injected did not affect the relative permeability exhibited in low Ca2+ compared with standard conditions. These results indicate that reducing external [Ca2+] elevates AQP0 water permeability by about the same factor as reducing pH. What is the full range of water permeability modulation that can be exhibited by AQP0? Fig. 6 Ashows that the combined effect on AQP0 water permeability of reducing pH and Ca2+ together is larger than reducing pH or Ca2+ separately, but the effects are not strictly additive. Lowering pH and Ca2+ together increased the relative permeability to 5.4 ± 0.6, the largest factor of increase observed in our experiments but smaller than the sum of the relative permeabilities due to pH alone (3.4 ± 0.4) and Ca2+alone (4.1 ± 0.4). These results suggest the involvement of two different interacting sites. Another way of probing for interdependence of pH and Ca2+is to investigate the effect of reducing Ca2+ on the histidine mutants lacking pH sensitivity. Fig. 6 Billustrates that all three pH-insensitive histidine mutants also fail to exhibit the increase in water permeability exhibited by wild type under low Ca2+ conditions. Results shown earlier suggest that pH or Ca2+ modulate the water permeability between a low permeability mode, seen under standard conditions, and a higher permeability mode. The failure of low Ca2+ to affect the permeability of any of the mutants demonstrates that this mode switch requires the critical histidine 40 residue. To determine whether the effects of low Ca2+ are mediated inside or outside the cell, we clamped the internal Ca2+ at low values using BAPTA and at high values using LPA. BAPTA injection greatly increases the internal Ca2+ buffering in the oocyte and reduces the free internal Ca2+ (35.Tsien R.Y. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2396-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar). Fig.7 A shows that injected BAPTA (final concentration, approximately 2 mm) increased the water permeability induced by AQP0 under standard ionic conditions. Furthermore, BAPTA rendered the water permeability insensitive to further change induced by lowering external Ca2+. Injections of BAPTA did not alter the water permeability of AQP1 (Fig.7 B) or control uninjected oocytes (data not shown). LPA, acting through a G protein, raises internal Ca2+concentration (36.Shiono S. Kawamoto K. Yoshida N. Kondo T. Inagami T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. 1993; 193: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 37.Noh, S. J., Kim, M. J., Shim, S., and Han, J. K. (1998) J. Cell. Physiol. 412–423Google Scholar). LPA treatment (10 μm in the bath) clamps the water permeability at control values for AQP0 and prevents the rise in permeability normally induced by low external Ca2+ (Fig. 7 A). We conclude that BAPTA injection induces and LPA treatment prevents the increased water permeability in AQP0 induced by lowering external [Ca2+]. In earlier biochemical experiments, two laboratories reported that calmodulin interacts with AQP0 (then called major intrinsic protein) (38.Girsch S.J. Peracchia C. Curr. Eye Res. 1991; 10: 839-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 39.Louis C.F. Hogan P. Visco L. Strasburg G. Exp. Eye Res. 1990; 50: 495-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility that calmodulin might mediate the Ca2+-dependent changes in water permeability in AQP0. We tested three calmodulin inhibitors, trifluoperazine (50 μm), calmidazolium (5 μm), and W7 (100 μm) (40.Menáe P. Pugliese F. Cinotti G.A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1996; 7: 983-990PubMed Google Scholar) and found that each inhibitor increased the AQP0 water permeability by an average factor of 3.7 ± 1.2 and rendered it insensitive to further alteration of the external Ca2+concentration (Fig. 8 A). These inhibitors had no effect on the water permeabilities of AQP1 (Fig.8 B) or uninjected control oocytes (data not shown). The fact that three structurally disparate calmodulin inhibitors have the same effect on AQP0-induced water permeability suggests that the Ca2+-dependent increase in water permeability may be mediated by calmodulin. In this paper, we demonstrate that reducing the external pH or Ca2+ increases AQP0 water permeability and that His40 is essential for allowing the protein to switch between high and low permeability states. This modulation in permeability may be physiologically important in the lens, allowing increased water circulation during times of increased metabolic activity. Our results contrast with a previous report that AQP0 undergoes no change in water permeability and that AQP3 water permeability decreases essentially to zero at acid pH (30.Cahalan K.L. Hall J.E. Biophys. J. 1998; 76 (abstr.): 183Google Scholar). Interestingly AQP0 and AQP3 are the only aquaporins that share the three histidines His40, His122, and His201 in AQP0. Our results raise the possibility that His40 may facilitate switching in AQP3 as well. We summarize the conditions favoring the high or low permeability states of AQP0 in TableI with the relativeP f in parentheses. Each experimental condition increased AQP0 water permeability by a factor of three to five. The combined effects of lowering pH and Ca2+ together were less than strictly additive, suggesting saturation of a common final pathway, such as single channel permeability or the probability of channel opening. Furthermore, the His40 mutants not only lost pH sensitivity but also calcium sensitivity, suggesting that the AQP0 water permeability depends upon two sites, one pH-sensitive and one Ca2+-sensitive, that interact via a common pathway, requiring His40, to determine the range of modulation.Table IModulation of AQP0 water permeabilityLow permeabilityHigh permeability1.8 mM Ca2+ and pH 7.5Low pH (3.4 ± 0.4)DEPC + hydroxylamineDEPC (4.2 ± 0.5)LPAHis40 mutants (3.5 ± 0.9)aFor mutants the reference standard permeability in Equation 1, P st, was that of wild-type AQP0 at pH 7.5, 1.8 mm Ca2+.LPA and low Ca2+Low Ca2+(4.1 ± 0.4)Low Ca2+ and low pH (5.4 ± 0.6)BAPTA (3.5 ± 0.6)BAPTA and low Ca2+ (3.7 ± 0.5)Cam inhibitors (3.7 ± 1.2)This table summarizes the conditions that produce high or low water permeability states of AQP0.

Open table in a new tab This table summarizes the conditions that produce high or low water permeability states of AQP0. The numbers in parentheses show the relative permeability calculated according to Equation 1 plus or minus the standard error. The BAPTA and LPA experiments, along with supportive data from the calmodulin inhibitors, require coupling between external and internal Ca2+ concentration in the oocyte system. We cannot identify this coupling mechanism at present. But because clamping the internal calcium concentration at high or low values over rides the effect of any external Ca2+, whereas the converse is not so, we conclude that the Ca2+ concentration must be sensed internally. The most significant finding of this paper is that the water permeability of AQP0 is regulated by ions in the physiological range found in the lens. Our data indicate that AQP0, but not AQP1 or AQP4, can switch from low to high permeability states as pH or Ca2+ is reduced. Because AQP0 is the major membrane protein of the lens and present at a very high density, there is the potential to increase dramatically the water permeability of a fiber cell. Low pH would elevate the water permeability of AQP0 in the interior of the lens. Because lowered pH is a consequence of metabolic activity, it would provide a feedback signal to increase fluid flow to areas of increased metabolic activity or to areas under-supplied by the intrinsic circulation.

Recordings from direction-selective neurons in area MT of the macaque suggested that this perceptual segregation did not depend on the presence of two peaks in the population activity. Rather, the visual system seemed to use overall shape of the population response to determine the number and directions of motion components. This approach explained a number of perceptual phenomena, including susceptibility of the motion system to direction metamers, motion patterns combining three or five directions incorrectly perceived by subjects as comprising only two directions. Our findings offer insights into the coding of multi-valued sensory signals and provide constraints for biologically based computational models."

Chemokines have pleiotropic biological effects. They are well known to regulate the recruitment and trafficking of leukocytes to sites of inflammation. The α chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) also has been reported to promote tumor cell growth (4.Schadendorf D. Moller A. Algermissen B. Worm M. Sticherling M. Czarnetzki B.M. J.

Despite the prominent migratory behavior of ovarian cancer, no report to our knowledge has investigated which chemokine receptors and/or ligands may be involved in this phenomenon. Chemotactic and growth signals initiated by chemokines belonging to α (-CXC), β (-CC), γ (-C), and δ (-CX3C) subfamilies are all transduced by the activation of heptahelical G protein-coupled receptors (9.Rollins B.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 909-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins involved are members of the pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi and -insensitive Gq families. Both the Gα subunits from the Gq class and the Gβγ subunit complex released from Gi are involved in chemokine-induced signaling (10.Wu D. LaRosa G.J. Simon M.I. Science. 1993; 261: 101-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The activation of these G protein subunits by agonist-bound receptors triggers a typical signal transduction pathway involving activation of phospholipase C β isoforms. This results in the generation of diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate with a subsequent increase in protein kinase C (PKC) activity and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization (10.Wu D.

However, no information on whether chemokines utilize similar mechanisms of cross-talk has been presented. With this background, we examined ovarian cancer cells and found robust expression of the IL-8-specific receptors CXCR-1 and CXCR-2. Stimulation of these cells with recombinant human IL-8 resulted in the rapid activation of p44/42 MAP kinases (Erk1/2). Furthermore, we found that the EGF receptor and c-Src participated in the transduction of GPCR-mediated IL-8 signals, indicating a newly observed link between G protein-coupled chemokine receptor activation and tyrosine kinases believed important in ovarian cancer cell proliferation.

Prior to stimulation, the cells were serum-starved for 24 h. Stimulation occurred at 37 °C with IL-8 (100 ng/ml) or EGF (10 ng/ml) as specified in the figures. Cells were detached from the substratum with 2 mm EDTA/Dulbecco's PBS (minus Ca2+ and Mg2+). They were washed twice with D-PBS and resuspended at 3 × 105 cells/0.5 ml and then incubated on ice for 30 min with primary antibody (anti-human IL-8RA-conjugated with PE or with PE-conjugated mouse IgG2b isotype control). Cells were screened for the expression of IL-8RB by incubation on ice for 30 min with monoclonal IL-8RB primary antibody, washed, and then incubated for another 30 min on ice with the secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate). Normal mouse IgG was used as the control. After the final incubation, cells were washed twice with D-PBS and analyzed immediately on a Becton Dickinson FACSCAN driven by Cell Quest software (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA). Cells (4 × 105) plated in 12-well plates were allowed to grow to 80% confluency and then were serum-starved for 24 h. Quiescent cells were then incubated for 6 h in serum-free medium or medium containing fetal bovine serum or TNF-α. Culture medium was cleared by centrifugation at 2000 rpm and 4 °C to remove debris. IL-8 secreted into the culture medium was quantitated using the human IL-8 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit obtained from Endogen (Woburn, MA). The effect of IL-8 on the morphology of SK-OV-3 cells was monitored using time-lapse video microscopy. Cells were detached from the substratum with 2 mm EDTA/D-PBS (minus Ca2+ and Mg2+), and washed twice with McCoy's 5A medium. Before the start of the experiment, cells (1 × 105) were cultured in 35 × 10 mm tissue culture plates (Becton Dickinson Labware) in serum-free McCoy's 5A medium for 18 h in a humidified 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. The cells were then observed via time-lapse video microscopy in a 37 °C and 5% CO2 controlled chamber, and 12 h later they were stimulated with IL-8 (50 ng/ml). Changes in cell morphology were examined using an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope, Omega temperature control device, Optronics Engineering DE1–750 3CCD digital video camera, and Sony SVT-S3100 time-lapse S-VHS video recorder. For image presentation, video images were captured and printed with the Sony Color Video Printer UP-5600MD. After stimulation, monolayers were washed with ice-cold D-PBS and lysed in chilled radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 1 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 1 μg/ml pepstatin). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm, and protein concentration was determined using a Dc protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). For immunoprecipitations, 1 ml of cell lysates (0.5 to 1.0 mg/ml protein) was incubated at 4 °C for 1–2 h with the appropriate primary antibodies. The immune complexes absorbed to protein A or Gamma Bind plus Sepharose were washed thrice with chilled lysis buffer, once with d-PBS, and then eluted with 2× Laemmli SDS sample buffer. When GST fusion proteins were used in immunoprecipitations, glutathione-Sepharose 4B was employed to adsorb the immune complexes. The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 5% milk prepared in Tris-buffered saline-T (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) and probed for 1–2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C with the appropriate antibodies diluted in blocking buffer. The membranes were washed and incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody diluted in Tris-buffered saline-T for 1 h at room temperature. The immune complexes on the washed membranes were visualized using ECL reagents. MAP kinase activity was determined following immunoprecipitation using MBP as substrate. Serum-starved cells pretreated with vehicle or specific inhibitors were stimulated with IL-8 or EGF, as indicated in the figures. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer and clarified at 15,000 × g for 15 min, and then 100–500 μg of protein was immunoprecipitated with 1 μg each of anti-Erk1 and Erk2. After 4 h at 4 °C, the immune complexes were absorbed to protein A-Sepharose. After overnight rocking at 4 °C, the beads were washed thrice with lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors and twice with kinase buffer (20 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 3 mmβ-mercaptoethanol). Phosphorylation of MBP was carried out at room temperature for 30 min in a total volume of 25 μl by the addition of a mixture containing 5–7 μg of MBP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 20 μm ATP to the Erk1/2 immunoprecipitates. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 4× Laemmli SDS buffer. 32P-labeled MBP was resolved on 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. SK-OV-3 ovarian cancer cells were screened for cell surface expression of chemokine receptors by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Only cells incubated with monoclonal anti-human IL-8RA (CXCR-1) antibody conjugated with PE or anti-IL-8RB (CXCR-2) primary antibody followed by staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody displayed a shift in fluorescence intensity (Fig. 1). This confirmed the expression of α chemokine IL-8-specific receptors, CXCR-1 and CXCR-2. Secretion of IL-8 protein by various cell lines in the absence or presence of cytokines like TNF-α, IL-1α, and -β has been reported (4.Schadendorf D. Moller A. Algermissen B. Worm M. Sticherling M. Czarnetzki B.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 2667-2675PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Singh R.K. Varney M.L. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1532-1537PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Standiford T.J. Kunkel S.L.

To determine if SK-OV-3 cells produced IL-8 protein, monolayers of quiescent cells were stimulated for 6 h with medium alone or medium containing varying concentrations of FBS or TNF-α (20 ng/ml). A dose-dependent increase in the release of IL-8 was detected in response to FBS by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. At 5% FBS, approximately 1 ng/ml of IL-8 was detected; controls without serum yielded 0.1 ng/ml, and TNF-α stimulation yielded 1.2 ng/ml (data not shown). Chemotactically stimulated myeloid cells, neutrophils, and breast cancer carcinoma cell lines undergo transient cytoskeletal rearrangements that lead to morphological alterations, ultimately resulting in cell migration (7.Youngs S.J.

Similarly, SK-OV-3 cells, as shown in Fig. 2, E–H, displayed increased membrane ruffling and altered membrane protrusions in response to IL-8 as determined by time-lapse video microscopy. As seen in Fig. 2, A–D, untreated SK-OV-3 cells had little membrane ruffling and minimal actin protrusions. When IL-8 was added to the cells, increased membrane ruffling and the formation/retraction of thin actin-like projections were readily apparent (Fig. 2,E–H). The formation/retraction of thin actin-like projections was observed in at least 75% of the cells over an 18-h time period. IL-8 signals are transduced by the heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors CXCR-1 and CXCR-2. It is well documented that signals relayed by various GPCRs result in the activation of MAP kinases Erk1 and Erk2 (15.Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 18.Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T. Daaka Y. Luttrell D.K. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

To examine the effect of IL-8 on MAP kinase activation, lysates from SK-OV-3 cells treated with IL-8 (100 ng/ml) were immunoprecipitated with anti-Erk1 and Erk2-specific antibodies and subjected to an in vitro kinase assay. The activation of these MAP kinases was assessed by the extent of phosphorylation of the substrate, MBP. Maximum activation was observed between 1 and 2 min, and leveled off by 10 min (Fig.3 A). Depending on the G protein subunits involved, a variety of effectors can be activated that result in multiple signaling pathways. We therefore mapped pathways leading to Erk1/2 activation in SK-OV-3 cells in response to IL-8 stimulation. Pretreatment of cells with PTX (100 ng/ml) or tyrosine kinase-specific inhibitors genestein (20 μm) and herbimycin A (1 μm) or down-regulation of PKC by prolonged exposure to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (100 nm) each had a significant effect on reducing enzyme activity (Fig. 3 B). This suggested the involvement of tyrosine kinases in CXCR-1 and CXCR-2 mediated signaling in these cells. Activation of the Ras-dependent MAP kinase signaling pathway by receptor tyrosine kinases involves the recruitment of a Grb2.son-of-sevenless complex to the plasma membrane, either directly or indirectly by its association with phosphorylated Shc (24.Buday L.

To address whether these cytosolic adaptor molecules participated in the transduction of IL-8 signals, interacting proteins from cell lysates treated with IL-8 (100 ng/ml) or EGF (10 ng/ml) were immunoprecipitated with a full-length GST·Grb2 fusion protein. IL-8 treatment induced phosphorylation of a number of cellular proteins and their association with GST-Grb2 (Fig.4). Of these Grb2-associating proteins, the ∼170-kDa molecule was identified as the EGF receptor and the 46-, 52-, and 66-kDa proteins as the isoforms of Shc. Although the phosphorylation and association of the 46 and 52 kDa forms of Shc were transient, occurring as early as 1 min, the phosphorylation of p66 was much weaker and sustained over a 30-min period. The EGF receptor is one of the protein-tyrosine kinases that has been implicated in transducing signals initiated by GPCR-specific agonists like angiotensin II, LPA, and bombesin (25.Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar, 26.Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A.

To determine if the EGF receptor plays a role in CXCR-1/2-mediated signaling in ovarian cancer cells, lysates from cells stimulated with IL-8 (100 ng/ml) or EGF (10 ng/ml) were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody. Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitated proteins clearly showed the phosphorylation of a 170-kDa protein. Transactivation of the EGFR was rapid, reaching a maximum by 2 min (Fig. 5). The specificity of this rapid phosphorylation was further confirmed by pretreating cells with the EGF receptor kinase-specific inhibitor, tyrphostin AG1478. Incubation of cells with AG1478 (250 nm) for 30 min prior to stimulation with IL-8 or EGF significantly reduced the activation of the EGF receptor (Fig. 5). Tyrphostin AG1478, the inhibitor of EGF receptor autophosphorylation, was found to partially block IL-8 or EGF-induced downstream signals leading to the activation of MAP kinase (Fig.6, A and B, and9 A). In the control cells, the maximum phosphorylation of the MBP substrate occurred at 1 min and tapered off by 10 min, whereas in the AG1478-treated cells there was a weak but gradual increase in phosphorylation, peaking by 10 min.Figure 9A, effect of EGFR and Src tyrosine kinase inhibitors AG1478 and PP1, respectively, on IL-8- or EGF-induced phosphorylation of Shc.

Shc was immunoprecipitated (IP) from cell lysates with anti-Shc polyclonal antibody.

As a signaling molecule, turnover of ceramide must be tightly regulated. Ceramide synthase and ceramidase catalyze synthesis and degradation of ceramide, respectively. Ceramide synthase activity has been detected in mammalian (5.Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and yeast cells (6.Wu W.I.

It catalyzes the acylation of sphingosine by a fatty acyl-CoA. Additional studies show that ceramide can also be synthesizedin vitro from sphingosine and palmitic acid in a CoA-independent reverse activity of a sphingolipid ceramide deacylase (7.Ito M. Kurita T.

Several ceramidase activities responsible for the breakdown of ceramide have been detected in mammalian cells (9.Hassler D.F. Bell R.M. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 49-57PubMed Google Scholar). Ceramidases are classified as acidic, neutral, or alkaline based on their pH optimum. Acidic ceramidase is localized in lysosomes and is responsible primarily for catabolism of ceramide (10.Bernardo K. Hurwitz R. Zenk T. Desnick R.J. Ferlinz K. Schuchman E.H. Sandhoff K. J. Biol.

Bielawska A. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27948-27955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). As in mammals, dihydroceramide and phytoceramide are important intermediates of complex sphingolipids in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (4.Dickson R.C. Lester L.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 305-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Several studies have implicated dihydro/phytoceramide, dihydro/phytosphingosine, and dihydro/phytosphingosine 1-phosphate in mediating regulation of cell growth and stress responses in yeast (16.Saba J.D.

Consequently, cellular levels of these sphingolipids have to be regulated either by their immediate conversion to more complex sphingolipids or by their breakdown. Coordinated action of multiple metabolic enzymes is a key to fulfill this task of regulation and underscores the importance of this regulation for signaling processes in S. cerevisiae. Identification of these enzymes will facilitate our understanding of the signaling processes mediated by sphingolipids. We elected to apply yeast genetic techniques to clone ceramide synthase. This enzyme is also a target of a fungal toxin, namely fumonisin B1, which inhibits cell growth by suppressing synthesis of sphingolipids (6.Wu W.I. McDonough V.M. Nickels Jr., J.T. Ko J. Fischl A.S. Vales T.R. Merrill Jr., A.H. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13171-13178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We therefore used the strategy of overexpressing a high copy yeast genomic DNA library to identify genes whose overexpression endows resistance to growth suppression by fumonisin B1. By using this strategy we identified a gene whose overexpression imparts on cells the ability to synthesize sphingolipids in the presence of fumonisin B1. Here we describe this approach, and we provide evidence that the gene we obtained,YPC1,1 in fact encodes a yeast alkaline ceramidase. Moreover, YPC1p also has the reverse activity of catalyzing ceramide formation from phytosphingosine and palmitic acid independent of coenzyme A, thus explaining why we obtained this enzyme as a fumonisin B1-resistant gene. Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I. The mutant strain Δyor1 was derived from the wild type JK9–3d α by replacing a portion (from the start codon to nt 1073) of theYOR1 coding sequence with the G418-resistant gene (KanMax) as described (19.Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). Wild type and mutant strains were grown in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% dextrose, Difico). Plasmid-containing strains were grown in a uracil dropout medium SC-ura (CLONTECH). SC-ura medium with fumonisin B1 (450 μm) and Nonidet P-40 (0.005%) purchased from Sigma were used for selection of fumonisin B1-resistant transformants. SC-ura medium with 2% galactose was used to induce gene expression under control of the Gal1 promoter in the vector pYES2.Epicurian coli XL-1 and SURE strains were used for most gene manipulations.

The haploid strain (Δypc1) harboring the ypc1 deletion allele was selected by resistance to G418, and deletion of YPC1 was verified by PCR using a primer upstream of the start codon of theYPC1 coding region and another primer located in the middle of the gene KanMax.

To remove RNA, RNase (free from DNase I) was added to DNA preparations and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. DNA was partially digested with the diluted Sau31A for 20 min.

After being extracted with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) followed by chloroform using a phase lock gel tube (5′ → 3′, Inc., Boulder, CO), DNA was concentrated and desalted by a Microcon 100 device (Amicon) and quantitated by an UV spectrometer (Bechman) using a built-in DNA analysis program. The DNA concentration was adjusted to 0.5 μg/μl with 0.5× TE buffer (5 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.5 mm EDTA). The purified DNA (50 ng) was ligated at 14 °C overnight to 50 ng of the plasmid YEplac195 (21.Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2521) Google Scholar) which was digested by BamHI and dephosphorylated by the shrimp alkaline phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The ligation reaction (10 μl) was desalted by the Microcon 100 device, and 1/5 of the ligated DNA was transformed into SURE2-competent cells (Stratagene) by electroporation at 17 kV/cm field strength, 200 megohms resistance, 25 microfarads capacitance. Transformants were selected on LB plates with 75 μg/ml ampicillin. A total of 5 × 105 transformants was obtained, with 98% of them having inserts based on a DNA digestion test. All transformants were pooled and spun down at 4,000 rpm in a 150-ml centrifuge bottle for 15 min at 4 °C. Plasmids were purified using a Maxi-prep kit (Qiagen) after cells were washed twice with ice-cold TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA). The S. cerevisiaestrain Δyor1 was transformed with the above genomic DNA library by a modified lithium acetate method (22.Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Methods Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 255-269Google Scholar), and transformants were selected for uracil prototrophs. Approximately a total of 1 × 106 transformants was obtained and pooled. After cells were diluted to a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml, 0.2 ml of cells was plated onto each of 5 SC-ura plates containing 450 μm fumonisin B1 and 0.005% Nonidet P-40. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 4 days. More than 100 transformants that survived on fumonisin B1 plates were obtained. Twenty transformants were chosen for further analysis. Plasmids were isolated from these 20 transformants as described (20.Mao C. Wadleigh M. Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28690-28694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and transformed into the E. coli SURE strain by electroporation. Plasmids were amplified and purified as described (20.Mao C. Wadleigh M. Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28690-28694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). To confirm that resistance to fumonisin B1 was due to overexpression of a gene in a plasmid, each plasmid was re-introduced into the Δyor1 strain. The transformants were tested for resistance to fumonisin B1 by growing on the fumonisin B1 plates. Inserts in the plasmids that gave resistance to fumonisin B1 were partially sequenced from both ends using primers 5′CAGCTATGACCATGATTACGCC3′ (forward) and 5′ACGTTGTAAAACG ACGGCCAGTG3′ (reverse). Searching the Saccharomyces Genomic Data base (SGD) with the partial sequences derived the entire sequences of inserts. The open reading frame (ORF) of the YPC1 gene was amplified by PCR (1 cycle of 94 °C for 2 min; 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min; 1 cycle of 72 °C for 10 min) using the precision plus Taq polymerase (Stratagene, Inc.) and the primers 5′CGGGGTACCATGGGAATATTTCGTTGGAACTATC3′ (forward) and 5′CGGGAATTCTTACTTCTCCTTTTTAACTTCAATTGATTGATC3′ (reverse). The amplified products were digested by restriction enzymes KpnI and EcoRI and cloned into KpnI andEcoRI sites of the vector pYES2 to yield the construct pYES2-YPC1, thus expressing YPC1p under control of the promoterGal1. The construct pYES2-YPC1 and the empty vector pYES2 were introduced into the strain Δyor1 by the lithium acetate method after sequencing to ensure that no errors were introduced into the YPC1 ORF by PCR. The strain containing pYES2-YPC1 or pYES2 was grown and maintained in SC-ura medium with 2% glucose. Expression of YPC1p was induced in SC-ura medium with 2% galactose. The coding sequence of the gene YPC1 was excised by restriction enzymes KpnI and EcoRI from the plasmid pYES2-YPC1 and cloned intoKpnI and EcoRI sites of the vector pBAD/His B (Invitrogen) which was digested by the same enzymes to create pBAD/His-YPC1, thus expressing the polyhistidine (His) and Xpress tagged YPC1p under control of the araBAD promoter (PBAD). pBAD/His and pBAD/His-YPC1 were introduced into theE. coli strain TOP10 by electroporation. Expression of the tagged YPC1p was induced by 0.2% arabinose whose concentration was optimized as suggested by the manufacturer. Expression of the tagged YPC1p was verified by Western blotting analysis using the mouse monoclonal antibody against the Xpress or His tag (Invitrogen, Inc.). The tagged YPC1p was extracted from E. coli cells by treating with lysozyme in a lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 20 μg/ml CLAP (CLAP, the mixture of chymostatin, leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin)) followed by several cycles of freezing and thawing and a brief sonication according to the procedures suggested by the manufacturer. The tagged YPC1p was purified by a Talon metal affinity column (CLONTECH, Inc.) according to procedures provided by the manufacturer. [3H]Ceramide and phytoceramide were synthesized as follows:N-[9,10-3H]d-erythro-C16-ceramide andN-[9,10-3H]d-ribo-C16-phytoceramide were prepared by acylation of the respective sphingoid bases with [9,10-3H]palmitoylchloride generated in situfrom [9,10-3H]palmitic acid as described (23.Bielawska A. Hannun Y.A. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 311: 499-518Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar).d-Erythrosphingosine was obtained in stereo- and enantio-specific synthesis as described previously (24.Bielawska A. Szulc Z. Hannun Y.A. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 311: 499-518Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Phytosphingosine was from Sigma.N-Hexanoyl-d-erythro-[4,5-3H]dihydrosphingosine ([3H-]C-6-dihydroceramide),d-erythro-[4,5-3H]dihydrosphingosine, andd-erythro-[4,5-3H]dihydrosphingosine 1-phosphate were from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (ARC, Inc.). Microsomes were isolated from the yeast cells as described (20.Mao C. Wadleigh M. Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28690-28694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) with minor modification as follows. Cells were suspended in a lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 20 μg/ml CLAP) after being washed twice with ice-cold water. Cells were homogenized three times (3 × 30 s) with acid-washed glass beads (Sigma) using a Mini-beadbeater-8 (Biospec Products) set at the maximum speed. The cells were chilled on ice for 1 min between homogenizations. The resulting supernatant was transferred to a new tube after centrifugation at 2,000 rpm for 5 min. Unbroken cells and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 5 min. To pellet the membrane fraction, the supernatant was centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 40 min at 4 °C. The membrane fraction was rinsed gently with the lysis buffer and suspended in an appropriate assay buffer. Protein concentrations were determined using a Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). [3H]Ceramide (2.75 nmol), [3H]phytoceramide (2.5 nmol), or [3H]C-6-dihydroceramide (0.2 nmol) in ethanol was dried on a SpeedVac (Savant) and dissolved in 20 μl of the assay buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm CaCl) with 0.5% Triton X-100 by boiling for 10 s followed by sonication in a water bath ultrasonicator (Cole-Parmer) for 2 min as described (25.Mitsutake S. Kita K. Okino N. Ito M. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 247: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To measure ceramidase activity, 20 μl (approximately 150–300 μg of proteins) of microsomes were added to substrates, and reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 40–90 min. Both the protein concentration and the time of incubation were within the linear range for the assay. The reactions were terminated by adding 200 μl of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v). Reaction mixture was dried and dissolved in 30 μl of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v). 25 μl of the mixture was applied onto a silica gel 60A TLC plate (Whatman) and resolved by the solvent system I (chloroform, methanol, 25% ammonium hydroxide, 9:2:0.5, v/v) (25.Mitsutake S. Kita K. Okino N. Ito M. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 247: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Free palmitic acid or DHS, the reaction product separated from the substrate by TLC, was identified according to a standard and quantified by a scintillation counter. One unit of ceramidase was defined as the amount of the enzyme needed to release 1 pmol of palmitic acid or dihydrosphingosine per min. To measure the activity of ceramide synthase independent of fatty acyl-CoA, phytosphingosine (5 nmol) and [3H]palmitic acid (0.3 nmol) were dried on a SpeedVac and dissolved in 20 μl of the buffer A as described above. Twenty μl of microsomes were added to the above substrates and incubated at 30 °C for 4–5 h. Both protein concentration and time of incubation were within the linear range for the assay. Reactions were terminated as described above. Ceramide formation was analyzed by the same TLC system with C16-phytoceramide as a standard. One unit of ceramide synthase was defined as the amount of the enzyme needed to form 1 pmol of phytoceramide per min. Cells (3 × 107 in 1 ml of medium) were labeled with [3H]palmitic acid, serine, or C-6-dihydroceramide (5–10 μCi) at 30 °C for different periods. Total lipids were extracted, deacylated by monomethylamine (20% in ethanol), and resolved by TLC using the solvent system II (chloroform, methanol, 4.2 n ammonium hydroxide, 9:7:2, v/v) as described (26.Mandala S.M. Thornton R.A. Frommer B.R. Curotto J.E. Rozdilsky W. Kurtz M.B. Giacobbe R.A. Bills G.F. Cabello M.A. Martin I. Peláez F. Harris G.H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1995; 48: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). TLC plates were sprayed with EN3HANCE and radiographed on BioMax films (Eastman Kodak Co.). Radiolabeled sphingolipids were identified according to the authentic standards included on the same TLC plate. To quantify an individual lipid, the radioactive bands were scraped and counted by a scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments). Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were detected by Western blotting analysis by following standard procedures. In order to clone the S. cerevisiae ceramide synthase, we set out to screen for genes whose overexpression imparts resistance to fumonisin B1, using a high copy yeast genomic DNA library. The yeast strain we used for this screen had a deletion of the gene that encodes the long chain base lyase, which made this strain more sensitive to fumonisin B1 and allowed us to use less fumonisin B1 for the screen. Upon screening this library we obtained 3 clones all of which were similar and encoded for a known yeast gene that is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family of genes namelyYOR1 (yeast oligomycin resistance gene). The reason YOR1p endows resistance to fumonisin B1 appears to be due to its ability to pump out fumonisin B1 and/or other sphingolipids that may accumulate as a result of fumonisin B1 treatment. 2C. Mao and L. M. Obeid, manuscript in preparation. In order to pursue our initial goal to obtain ceramide synthase, we next elected to prepare a yeast genomic DNA library from theΔyor1 strain and to use this library to screen for genes that impart resistance to fumonisin B1 that are different fromYOR1 as described under “Materials and Methods.” Of the 20 fumonisin B1-resistant transformants we analyzed, 16 were found to have plasmid-dependent resistance to fumonisin. Fig.1 A shows that cells transformed with three separate representative clones confer resistance to fumonisin B1. The inserts of the plasmids were sequenced from both ends, and a search of the Saccharomyces Genomic Data base with the partial sequences obtained derived the entire sequence of the inserts. Sequencing revealed that 7 out of 16 clones were identical, having the same insert, spanning three ORFs. The 9 other plasmids contained different inserts. However, all the clones shared a consensus sequence covering a hypothetical ORF YBR183w on chromosome II. YBR183w, designated as YPC1, was the only ORF in one of the plasmids. We speculated that YBR183w might confer resistance to fumonisin B1. To verify if that was the case, we amplified the ORF YBR183w from yeast genomic DNA by PCR and cloned it into the yeast expression vector pYES2 to create the plasmid pYES2-YPC1, thus expressing YPC1p under the control of theGal1 promoter. pYES2-YPC1 and the vector pYES2 were introduced into the strain Δyor1, respectively. The vector-containing strain (Δyor1-Vec) and the pYES2-YPC1-containing strain (Δyor1-YPC1) were grown in SC-ura medium with 2% galactose. The expression of the geneYPC1 was induced by galactose. Fig. 1 B shows that the strain Δyor1-YPC1 but not Δyor1-Vec was resistant to fumonisin B1 in the galactose-containing medium. These data suggest that the resistance to fumonisin B1 is indeed attributed to overexpression of YPC1p. Examination of the YPC1p sequence predicted it to have several transmembrane domains. It had high homology to another yeast hypothetical protein encoded by the ORF YPL087w. A BLAST search showed that YPC1p did not have any significant homology to other proteins with known functions in all protein data bases searched, suggesting it is a novel protein. Motif search indicated that it contained an ATP-binding site (GXGXXG(X …X)10K, where X indicates any amino acid residue) shared by human diacylglycerol kinase ζ (27.Bunting M. Tang W. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10230-10236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and many protein kinases. On its carboxyl terminus, it had an ER retention signal (KKXK), which is shared by several ER proteins including sphingolipid metabolic enzymes ketodihydrosphingosine reductase TSC10p (28.Beeler T. Bacikova D. Gable K. Hopkins L. Johnson C. Slife H. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30688-30694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and dihydrosphingosine (or dihydroceramide) hydroxylase SYR2p (29.Haak D. Gable K. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29704-29710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), suggesting it might be localized to the ER. We could not predict function of the product of the YPC1gene based on protein homology. However YPC1 was selected for allowing resistance to fumonisin B1. Fumonisin B1 inhibited cell growth in the DHS-1-P lyase (DPL1) deletion because it led to accumulation of phosphorylated long chain bases and/or because it inhibited formation of ceramide and sphingolipids.2Therefore, we speculated that overexpression of YPC1p could either lead to breakdown of accumulated long chain base phosphates or to bypassing the ceramide synthase block and generating ceramide and other ceramide-containing sphingolipids despite the presence of fumonisin B1. To investigate this, the strains Δyor1-Vec andΔyor1-YPC1 were grown in SC-ura medium with galactose, which induced YPC1p expression. The cells were then treated with 100 μm fumonisin B1 for 2 h and labeled with palmitic acid for 4 h. Total lipids were extracted and resolved by TLC after base hydrolysis by monomethylamine as described under “Materials and Methods.” Autoradiography of the TLC plate (Fig.2 A) demonstrated that formation of the sphingolipids IPC, MIPC, and M(IP)2C was significantly blocked by fumonisin B1 in the vector control cells (Δyor1-Vec) but not in the YPC1p-overexpressing cells (Δyor1-YPC1). Quantitation showed that the Δyor1-YPC1 cells had 4 times more incorporation of palmitic acid into complex sphingolipids (IPC, MIPC, and M(IP)2C) than did the ΔΔyor1-Vec cells in the presence of fumonisin B1 (Fig. 2 B). The data suggest that overexpression of YPC1p reverses fumonisin B1-induced growth inhibition by allowing synthesis of sphingolipids. To gain further insight into the function of YPC1p, we next examined the effect of overexpression of YPC1p on sphingolipid metabolism in the absence of fumonisin B1. Upon labeling with either palmitic acid (Fig.3 A) or serine (Fig.3 B), we saw the opposite effect from above. The strain Δyor1-YPC1 had a reduced rate of radiolabel incorporation into complex sphingolipids as compared with the strainΔyor1-Vec. On the other hand the Δyor1-YPC1 strain accumulated PHS, DHS, PHS-1-P, and DHS-1-P much more than theΔyor1-Vec (Fig. 3, A and B). These data raised an intriguing possibility that YPC1p has a dual function of enhancing synthesis or breakdown of sphingolipids, depending on the presence or absence of fumonisin B1. Next we set out to investigate the dual activity of YPC1p. Decreases in IPC and other complex sphingolipids and increases in DHS, PHS, and their phosphorylated products upon overexpression of YPC1p hinted that YPC1p might be mediating breakdown of either ceramides or more complex sphingolipids. We therefore investigated the ability of YPC1 to mediate breakdown of ceramides by labeling YPC1p-overexpressing cells with C-6-dihydroceramide labeled with 3H at both the C-4 and C-5 positions of dihydrosphingosine backbone. We used C-6-dihydroceramide because it is taken up better than long acyl chain ceramides. Fig.3 C demonstrates that overexpression of YPC1p significantly enhanced degradation of dihydroceramide into DHS, PHS, DHS-1-P, and PHS-1-P. There were concomitant increases in phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylethanolamine. DHS is the immediate breakdown product of dihydroceramide, whereas PHS may be the product of DHS hydroxylation or the breakdown product of phytoceramide, which in turn is converted from dihydroceramide. Both DHS and PHS are known"

Bi-domain peptides with a factor XIIIa substrate in one domain and a RGD sequence in the other domain were covalently incorporated into fibrin gels during coagulation through the action of the transglutaminase factor XIIIa, and the RGD-dependent effect on neurite outgrowth was quantified, employing chick dorsal root ganglia cultured two- and three-dimensionally within the modified fibrin. Two separate bi-domain peptides were synthesized, one with a lower binding affinity linear RGD domain and another with a higher binding affinity cyclic RGD domain. Both peptides were cross-linked into fibrin gels at concentrations up to 8.2 mol of peptide/mol of fibrinogen, and their effect on neurite outgrowth was measured. Both two- and three-dimensional neurite outgrowth demonstrated a bi-phasic dependence on RGD concentration for both the linear and cyclic peptide, with intermediate adhesion site densities yielding maximal neurite extension and higher densities inhibiting outgrowth. The adhesion site density that yielded maximal outgrowth depended strongly on adhesion site affinity in both two and three dimensions, with lower densities of the higher affinity ligand being required (0.8–1.7 mol/mol for the linear peptideversus 0.2 mol/mol for the cyclic peptide yielding maximum neurite outgrowth rates in three-dimensional cultures). Three-dimensional neurite outgrowth rates within fibrin matrices that contained variable amounts of RGD peptides were shown to depend on adhesion site density and affinity. Bi-domain peptides with a factor XIIIa substrate in one domain and a RGD sequence in the other domain were covalently incorporated into fibrin gels during coagulation through the action of the transglutaminase factor XIIIa, and the RGD-dependent effect on neurite outgrowth was quantified, employing chick dorsal root ganglia cultured two- and three-dimensionally within the modified fibrin.

Tris-buffered saline dorsal root ganglia Cell adhesion and migration in two and three dimensions play important roles in a host of physiological phenomena, including neurite extension (1.Jessell T.M. Kandel E.R. Schwartz J.H. Jessell T.M. Principles of Neural Science. Simon and Schuster, East Norwalk, CT1991: 908-928Google Scholar), angiogenesis (2.Beck L. D'Amore P.A. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), and immune responses (3.Benelli R. Mortarini R. Anichini A. Giumciuglio D. Noonan D.M. Montalti S. Tacchetti C. Albini A. AIDS. 1998; 12: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The adhesion of cells within their environment is controlled primarily by the binding of cell surface receptors to short, exposed protein domains in the extracellular matrix. An important receptor family involved in adhesion and migration is the integrins, a class of heterodimeric receptors that interact with both extracellular matrix and cell-surface ligands (4.Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9002) Google Scholar, 5.Yamada K.M. Matrix Biol. 1997; 16: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Each unique dimeric receptor binds to a particular subset of ligands, which can often be mimicked with immobilized short peptides (6.Massia S.P. Hubbell J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1089-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). One such short peptide that binds to integrins and influences subsequent cell adhesion and migration is RGD, a motif present in many proteins, including fibronectin, laminin, collagen, and fibrinogen (7.Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12809-12812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This sequence has been shown to be recognized by α5β1, αvβ3 (8.Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1984; 309: 30-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (2867) Google Scholar), and several other integrin heterodimer pairs. Adhesion and migration upon a surface are distinct processes that depend on related molecular mechanisms. Cell adhesion involves the dynamic interaction between cell surface receptors and adhesion ligands on the supporting matrix (9.Ruoslahti E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1490) Google Scholar, 10.Lander A. Trends Neurosci. 1989; 12: 189-195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), with the strength of this attachment being related to the concentration of cell-surface receptors, the concentration of ligands available, and the specific binding affinity of the receptor ligands and pairs (11.Palecek S.P. Loftus J.C. Ginsberg M.H. Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Nature. 1997; 385: 537-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar). Migration of cells upon a material is an analogous phenomenon, with the rate of cell migration depending on both ligand density and binding affinity as well as the density of corresponding cell surface receptors. As cells move within their environment, they must constantly detach at the trailing edge and reattach at the leading edge to nearby ligands (12.DiMilla P.A. Stone J.A. Quinn J.A. Albelda S.M. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 729-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 13.Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3274) Google Scholar). The corresponding rate of cell migration upon a surface depends on the simultaneous detachment and attachment to nearby ligands, causing extreme ligand densities (both high and low) to inhibit one of these two processes and subsequently limit cell migration rates. The outgrowth of neurites is analogous to cell migration (14.Bixby J.L. Harris W.A. Annu. Rev. Cell. Biol. 1991; 7: 117-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), with receptor cluster morphology (15.Gomez T.M. Roche F.K. Letourneau P.C. J. Neurobiol. 1996; 29: 18-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and receptor dynamics at the growth cone (16.Schmidt C.E. Dai J. Lauffenburger D.A. Sheetz M.P. Horwitz A.F. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3400-3407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) controlling the process. Cell migration and neurite extension within a three-dimensional matrix involves a more complex balance of cellular activity than migration upon a two-dimensional surface, with cell-associated proteolysis playing a key role in three-dimensional migration. When cells are present inside a fibrin matrix for example, the porosity of the fibrous network is significantly smaller than the average cell and even neurite size. Therefore, in order for cells or neurites to migrate within fibrin, it is necessary that the surrounding matrix be remodeled, and this is accomplished through the action of the protease plasmin (17.Herbert C.B. Bittner G.D. Hubbell J.A. J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 365: 380-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 18.Shea T.B. Beermann M.L. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 19.Pittman R.N. Buettner H.M. Dev. Neurosci. 1989; 11: 361-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). While adhesion signals still play an important role in three-dimensional migration, the dependence also on proteolysis complicates a one-to-one correlation between two- and three-dimensional cell migration. The focus of this work was neurite migration within a fibrin matrix with controlled adhesive characteristics. Through the action of the transglutaminase, factor XIIIa, bi-domain peptides were incorporated within a three-dimensional fibrin matrix at precise and predetermined concentrations (20.Schense J.C. Hubbell J.A. Bioconjug. Chem. 1999; 10: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). A bi-phasic response was observed in both two- and three-dimensional neurite outgrowth, with intermediate RGD adhesion site densities leading to fastest outgrowth. Outgrowth rates depended strongly on binding affinity with a lower number of higher affinity binding sites leading to a similar response as a higher number of lower affinity ligands. dLNQEQVSPLRGD-NH2 and dLNQEQVSPLRDG-NH2 (d = dansyl; for clarity, the factor XIIIa substrate domain (21.Ichinose A. Tamaki T. Aoki N. FEBS Lett. 1983; 153: 369-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) is shown in italics) were synthesized on solid resin using an automated peptide synthesizer (9050 Pep Plus Synthesizer, Millipore, Framingham, MA) with standard 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl chemistry (22.Fields G. Noble R. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1990; 35: 161-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (2330) Google Scholar). These peptides were labeled with a fluorescent probe by including an α-dansylated leucine (Sigma, Buchs, Switzerland) at the amino terminus of the peptide. Hydrophobic scavengers and cleaved protecting groups were removed by precipitation of the peptide in cold diethyl ether and dissolution in deionized water. After lyophilization, these two peptides were redissolved in 0.03 m Tris-buffered saline (TBS,1 pH 7.0) and analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography (Waters, Milford, CT) on a size exclusion column with TBS, pH 7.0, as the running buffer. The cyclic peptide, NH2-LNQEQVSPD[CRGDNRC] (cyclic ring shown in brackets), was purchased from Genemed (South San Francisco, CA) at greater than 85% purity. Fibrinogen solutions were prepared by dissolving fibrinogen (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) in deionized water at 8 mg/ml for 4 h. Dialysis (Spectrum, 6000–8000 MWCO; Laguna Hills, CA)versus 400 volumes of TBS, pH 7.4, for 24 h was used to exchange salts present in the protein solution. The resulting solution was then sterilized by filtering through a 0.22-μm syringe filter. The final fibrinogen concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance of the protein solution at 280 nm (23.Dellenback R.J. Chien S. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1970; 134: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). TBS solutions at pH 7.0 that were made with either 50 mm Ca2+ or without any Ca2+ were sterilized by filtration though a 0.22-μm filter. Fresh thrombin solutions were made by dissolving thrombin (Sigma, Buchs, Switzerland) in TBS at pH 7.0 at a concentration of 20 units/ml. Fibrin gels were made in flat-bottomed 24-well culture plates by mixing the four components such that final concentrations obtained were 1) 3.6 mg/ml fibrinogen, 2) 2.5 mm Ca2+, 3) 2 NIH units/ml of thrombin, and 4) various amounts of added peptide. DRGs were dissected from 8-day-old White Leghorn chicken embryos (24.Varon S.J. Nomura J. Perez-Polo J.R. Shooter E.M. Fried R. Methods of Neurochemistry. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1972: 203-229Google Scholar). Ganglia were temporarily stored in modified neurobasal medium, consisting of insulin (5 μg/ml), transferrin (100 μg/ml), progesterone (6.3 ng/ml), putrascine (16.11 μg/ml), selenite (5.2 ng/ml), fibronectin (5 μg/ml),l-glutamine (0.5 mm), l-glutamate (25 μm), murine mouse nerve growth factor (20 ng/ml), 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic added to neurobasal medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). DRGs were cultured within 400 μl of unmodified fibrin gels, with the gels being polymerized in the presence of a DRG such that one ganglion was embedded three-dimensionally within the fibrin gel during polymerization. After polymerization, 1 ml of modified medium was added to the matrices. In three series of experiments, the medium added after fibrin gel polymerization was further supplemented with either of the RGD peptides or the control RDG peptide added as soluble competitive inhibitors. In the first experiment, the linear RGD peptide was added to the medium at concentrations of 0, 0.21, 0.42, and 1.05 mm. The peptide-supplemented medium was changed at 3, 6, and 9 h after seeding, and the migration of neurites at 24 h was quantified and normalized to that observed when 0 mg/ml soluble peptide was added. A second series of experiments was performed in which the cyclic RGD peptide was added as a competitive soluble inhibitor at the concentrations of 0, 0.08, 0.16, or 0.40 mm. Finally, a third series of experiments was performed with the linear RDG peptide, where the peptide was added to the medium at concentrations of 0, 0.21, 0.42, and 1.05 mm. The washing and analysis procedures were identical to those used with the linear RGD peptide, with the peptide-supplemented medium changed at 3, 6, and 9 h. Neurite outgrowth was measured as described below. DRGs were cultured upon fibrin gels without added exogenous peptides (all values were normalized to this level of neurite extension within native fibrin) or with cross-linked dLNQEQVSPLRGD-NH2, dLNQEQVSPLRDG-NH2 or LNQEQVSPD[CRGDNRC]. 300-μl gels were synthesized with various amounts of peptide and washed at 3, 6, 9, and 24 h after gelation with TBS to remove noncross-linked peptide. The peptides employed were cross-linked at different densities. The linear RGD and RDG were incorporated separately in a series of final concentrations that corresponded to 0.8, 1.7, 4.4, and 8.2 mol of peptide/mol of fibrinogen, obtained by polymerization of fibrinogen in the presence of 55, 110, 220, 275, and 330 μm peptide (20.Schense J.C. Hubbell J.A. Bioconjug. Chem. 1999; 10: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The cyclic RGD was incorporated at 0.2, 0.4, 4.4, and 8.2 mol of peptide/mol of fibrinogen, obtained by polymerization of fibrinogen in the presence of 13.75, 27.5, 275, and 330 μm peptide. DRGs were placed on the surface of the fibrin gel and allowed to adhere for 2 h before medium was added, and then the ganglia were cultured on the surface of the matrix for 24 h. The neuronal medium used was further modified by the addition of 1 μg/ml aprotinin to prevent the ganglia from detaching from the surface due to protease activity (17.Herbert C.B. Bittner G.D. Hubbell J.A. J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 365: 380-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Neurite extension was measured at 24 h after seeding as described below. DRGs were cultured within 400-μl fibrin gels without added exogenous peptides (all values were normalized to this level of neurite extension within native fibrin) or with cross-linked dLNQEQVSPLRGD-NH2, dLNQEQVSPLRDG-NH2, or LNQEQVSPD[CRGDNRC]. These gels were polymerized in the presence of a DRG such that one ganglion was embedded three-dimensionally within the fibrin gel during polymerization. All peptides were incorporated separately in a series of final concentrations that corresponded to 0.8, 1.7, 4.4, and 8.2 mol of peptide/mol of fibrinogen, obtained by polymerization of fibrinogen in the presence of 55, 110, 220, 275, and 330 μm peptide (20.Schense J.C. Hubbell J.A. Bioconjug. Chem. 1999; 10: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The cyclic peptide was cross-linked into the gel at two additional concentrations of 0.2 and 0.4 mol of peptide/mol of fibrinogen, obtained from the addition of 13.75 and 27.5 μm peptide during polymerization. The fibrin gels with embedded ganglia were cultured in 1 ml of modified neurobasal medium, and the medium was changed at 3, 6, 9, and 24 h after seeding to wash out noncross-linked peptide. Neurite outgrowth was measured at 24 and 48 h after seeding as described below. Images of the entire DRG and the outgrowing neurites were collected using phase contrast microscopy with a × 4.0 objective (Zeiss, Zurich, Switzerland). At each time point, the average neurite length extending from each DRG was measured by digital image processing as the area-averaged distance between the edge of the corona of extending neurites and the DRG body, measured as described in detail elsewhere (17.Herbert C.B. Bittner G.D. Hubbell J.A. J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 365: 380-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Confocal scanning laser microscopy of DRGs was performed at 24 h with a 10×/0.30 Plan Neofluor objective (Zeiss) using a MRC 600 confocal system (Bio-Rad, Glattbrugg, Switzerland). 200-μl fibrin gels containing various amounts of linear or cyclic RGD peptide or linear RDG peptide were polymerized with a DRG within the gel in the center of a 35-mm Petri dish. The DRGs were cultured in 2 ml of neuronal medium, which was replaced once at 6 h to remove free peptide. Samples were stained at 24 h, prior to imaging, by adding 2 μl of a 5 mg/ml stock solution of fluorescein diacetate in acetone to 1 ml of TBS. Approximately 50 images were taken at 10-μm intervals, and a composite image was assembled using Imaris (Bitplane, Zurich, Switzerland) image processing software on an Indigo2 extreme Silicon Graphics Workstation (Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA). The outgrowth for each individual ganglion was normalized by the mean neurite outgrowth observed for ganglia simultaneously cultured in or on unmodified fibrin. Experiments were completed in triplicate and these normalized values were then averaged to express the change in outgrowth in relation to outgrowth observed to unmodified fibrin. Statistical analyses of these data were performed using Statview 4.5 (Abacus, Berkeley, CA). Comparative analyses were completed using analysis of variance with Fisher's protectivet test at a 95% confidence level. Mean values and standard errors of the mean are shown. Linear curve fits were calculated for the data on inhibition with soluble peptides using Cricket Graph III (Computer Associates), which employs a linear least squares regression method. The analysis was limited to the linear domain of the inhibition curves and was used to determine the relative binding affinities of the two RGD peptides employed. As a measure of the relative binding affinity of the two RGD peptides employed, the effect of each peptide as a soluble competitive inhibitor of three-dimensional neurite outgrowth from day 8 chick DRGs within fibrin was studied. When the linear peptide, dLNQEQVSPLRGD, was added to the culture medium, after fibrin polymerization, as a competitive inhibitor in a concentration series, neurite outgrowth decreased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1). At the highest concentration tested, 1.05 mm, the peptide decreased neurite outgrowth by 25 ± 7% at 24 h relative to the outgrowth within unmodified fibrin in the absence of soluble peptide inhibitor (p< 0.05). The cyclic peptide LNQEQVSPD[CRGDNRC] decreased neurite outgrowth to a greater extent compared with the linear peptide,e.g. by 46 ± 6% at 24 h when 0.40 mmpeptide was added to the medium. Furthermore, at every concentration point, the cyclic RGD peptide inhibited the growth of neurites to a greater extent than did the linear RGD peptide (p < 0.05). Linear curve fits were calculated for the two active RGD peptides, and it was found that the slope for the curve fit for the cyclic RGD peptide was 9.0 times steeper than that for the curve fit for the linear RGD peptide. The control sequence, RDG, proved to have no effect on three-dimensional neurite outgrowth over the entire concentration range tested (p > 0.52). Fibrin gels were modified by cross-linking various concentrations of either the linear RGD peptide, the cyclic RGD peptide or the linear control RDG peptide, and a bi-phasic RGD-dependent effect on two-dimensional neurite outgrowth was observed (Fig. 2). When linear RGD was incorporated over the range of 0–8.2 mol of peptide/mol of fibrinogen, the cross-linking of 1.7 mol of linear RGD/mol of fibrinogen proved to provide the greatest enhancement of neurite outgrowth, increasing the level of neurite outgrowth by 23 ± 9% at 24 h (p < 0.05). Neurite outgrowth decreased for each of the higher peptide densities such that when 8.2 mol of linear RGD/mol of fibrinogen was incorporated the level of neurite outgrowth decreased by 16 ± 6% of the level seen in unmodified fibrin matrices (p < 0.05). The incorporation of the cyclic RGD peptide over the same concentration range demonstrated a similar bi-phasic effect on neurite outgrowth, with the maximal enhancement occurring at a lower cross-linked peptide density. When 0.2 mol of cyclic RGD/mol of fibrinogen was incorporated, the level of enhancement proved to be 26 ± 7% compared with unmodified fibrin. Once again, at each of the higher peptide densities, the level of neurite outgrowth decreased such that at 8.2 mol of cyclic RGD/mol of fibrinogen, the level of neurite outgrowth was reduced by 22 ± 5% of the level observed in unmodified fibrin. The control sequence, RDG, proved to not have an effect on neurite outgrowth over the entire concentration range tested, with the level of outgrowth similar to that in unmodified fibrin (p > 0.74). Fibrin gels were modified by cross-linking various concentrations of linear or cyclic RGD or linear RDGpeptide into the gel, and the resulting effect on three-dimensional neurite outgrowth was measured at 24 and 48 h. A bi-phasic response was observed, with the cross-linking of 1.7 mol of linear RGD peptide/mol of fibrinogen enhancing the level of neurite outgrowth by 23 ± 7% at 24 and 14 ± 5% at 48 h (p< 0.05) (Fig. 3). The incorporation of 4.4 or 8.2 mol of linear RGD peptide/mole fibrinogen decreased the level of neurite outgrowth, such that it was lower than the outgrowth observed within both unmodified fibrin as well as the fibrin modified with lower concentrations of cross-linked peptide (p < 0.05). At the highest incorporated adhesion density of 8.2 mol/mol, the level of neurite outgrowth was reduced by 21 ± 5% at 24 and 13 ± 4% at 48 h relative to outgrowth within unmodified fibrin. The incorporation of the higher affinity-binding cyclic peptide, LNQEQVSPD[CRGDNRC], into fibrin gels had a similar bi-phasic effect on the outgrowth of neurites, with an overall effect that was shifted to lower peptide densities relative to the effect for the lower affinity linear RGD peptide. Incorporation of 0.2 mol/mol of cyclic peptide enhanced the outgrowth of neurites by 17 ± 7% at 24 and 14 ± 3% at 48 h compared with outgrowth within unmodified fibrin (p < 0.05). Each of the higher cross-linking concentrations tested resulted in a decrease in neurite outgrowth, such that at 0.8 mol/mol, outgrowth was reduced by 25 ± 7% at 24 and 16 ± 4% at 48 h, and at 8.2 mol/mol, neurite outgrowth was reduced by 51 ± 5% at 24 and 25 ± 5% at 48 h relative to outgrowth within unmodified fibrin (p < 0.05). Incorporation of the RDGpeptide had no statistically significant effect on neurite outgrowth at either 24 or 48 h at any of the concentrations tested (p > 0.36). The relative binding affinities of the cyclic and the linear peptides were estimated from the results on competitive inhibition in three-dimensional outgrowth experiments. The cyclic peptide was estimated to bind 9.0 times more strongly. This ratio was used to compare the results in outgrowth with immobilized linear and cyclic peptides in terms of affinity, rather than molar amounts of peptide, by dividing the abscissa for the linear peptide by 9.0. The adjusted results are shown in Fig. 3. The curves, when adjusted according to relative affinity are highly coincident. The difference in outgrowth induced from the ganglia in the various samples was pronounced enough to be clearly observed. As a demonstration, a representative sample from materials that induced the greatest and the smallest neurite outgrowth are shown in Fig.4. Samples are shown for the linear peptide where maximal outgrowth (C) and minimal outgrowth (E) were achieved. An identical set are present for the cyclic peptide (D and F, respectively) in addition to representative samples for the two controls, unmodified fibrin (A) and RDG modified fibrin (B). The migration of cells within a three-dimensional matrix is an important component of many cellular processes both in vivoand in vitro. However, the lack of three-dimensional model materials in which the biochemical characteristics can be readily and reproducibly controlled prevents complete understanding of the relevant factors involved. Through the factor XIIIa-mediated modification of fibrin matrices, we have developed a method by which the bioactive character of a degradable matrix can be reproducibly manipulated (20.Schense J.C. Hubbell J.A. Bioconjug. Chem. 1999; 10: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Using these matrices, the influence that exogenous RGD sequences have on the outgrowth of neurites within a three-dimensional environment was studied, with the effect on neurite outgrowth shown to exhibit a bi-phasic dependence on RGD concentration and binding affinity. The relative binding affinities of the peptides employed were characterized by competitive inhibition experiments in three-dimensional culture. RGD is found endogenously in fibrin, at an active concentration of 2 mol/mol of fibrinogen (25.Ruoslahti E. Pierschbacher M.D. Science. 1987; 238: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (3869) Google Scholar). The addition of either of the RGD peptides as a soluble inhibitor blocked the activity of these endogenous sequences, resulting in a decrease in neurite outgrowth within the fibrin matrix. A high concentration of the linear RGD peptide (1.05 mm) was required to decrease the outgrowth of neurites. The addition of the cyclic RGD peptide as a soluble competitive inhibitor proved to be much more potent in slowing neurite outgrowth, such that at each tested concentration, the cyclic peptide inhibited neurite outgrowth to a greater extent than did the linear peptide. When the data were correlated to a linear curve fit, it was shown that the curve fit for the cyclic peptide was 9.0 times steeper then that for the linear RGD, indicating that the binding affinity in this system for the cyclic peptide is 9.0 times greater than that for the linear RGD peptide. This greater binding affinity for cyclic RGD peptides over linear RGD peptides has been demonstrated previously (26.Koivunen E. Wang B. Ruoslahti E. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), with the enhanced binding affinity due to the forced secondary structure occurring from the ring (27.Jois S.D. Tambunan U.S. Chakrabarti S. Siahaan T.J. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1996; 14: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It has been shown that cyclic RGD peptides adopt a conformation similar to the turn between strands in a β sheet, forcing cyclic peptides to mimic a common structural motif for native RGD sites (28.Dickinson C.D. Veerapandian B. Dai X.P. Hamlin R.C. Xuong N.H. Ruoslahti E. Ely K.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 1079-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional neurite outgrowth demonstrated a bi-phasic dependence on RGD site density, consistent with the outgrowth of neurites being a form of cell migration. Much experimental and modeling work has been completed showing that the effect of adhesion site surface concentration on the motility of cells, such as smooth muscle cells, displays a bi-phasic response (12.DiMilla P.A. Stone J.A. Quinn J.A. Albelda S.M. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 729-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 29.DiMilla P.A. Barbee K. Lauffenburger D.A. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 15-37Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The extent of the bi-phasic response in two dimensions depends on the adhesion site and receptor surface concentrations and the degree to which cell surface receptors are polarized toward the leading edge (11.Palecek S.P. Loftus J.C. Ginsberg M.H. Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Nature. 1997; 385: 537-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that the migration of the neuronal growth cone, and therefore the overall neurite outgrowth rate, represents a similar phenomenon (16.Schmidt C.E. Dai J. Lauffenburger D.A. Sheetz M.P. Horwitz A.F. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3400-3407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By incorporating RGD into a fibrin matrix, it has been demonstrated that the neurite outgrowth from chick DRGs displays such a bi-phasic dependence on RGD density, with a moderate peptide density eliciting the highest outgrowth rate. These results are thus consistent with the migration of neuronal growth cones, and therefore neurite outgrowth, being directly analogous to the migration of individual cells. RGD peptides cross-linked into fibrin gels demonstrated a bi-phasic adhesive-like character in three-dimensions. The striking similarity between the results in three-dimensional and two-dimensional outgrowth experiments suggest that the rate-controlling phenomena are similar between the two cases. This is very interesting, because in two-dimensional cultures proteolysis plays a minor role, whereas in the three-dimensional cultures proteolysis is required for neurite outgrowth (17.Herbert C.B. Bittner G.D. Hubbell J.A. J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 365: 380-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The similarity in results suggests that proteolysis of the fibrin matrix is not the rate-controlling phenomenon, but rather that adhesion and migration biomechanics control the overall outgrowth rate. The results also suggest, although indirectly, that the density of exogenous RGD sites did not influence neurite outgrowth rates primarily by modulating local protease activity. If they had done so, then the site density-dependent bi-phasic response that was observed in three-dimensional outgrowth (where proteolysis is requisite) would not have been observed in two-dimensional outgrowth (where proteolysis is not requisite) (17.Herbert C.B. Bittner G.D. Hubbell J.A. J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 365: 380-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A strong dependence of both two-dimensional and three-dimensional neurite outgrowth upon adhesion site binding affinity was observed. The phenomena observed for the two RGD peptides employed were similar in both form and extent, but with the response curve being markedly shifted to lower concentrations for the higher affinity cyclic RGD peptide such that a significantly lower incorporated density of cyclic RGD was required to induce maximal neurite outgrowth. To better quantify this phenomenon, the three-dimensional outgrowth was presented for the two RGD peptides in terms of comparable adhesive density rather than peptide density. This was accomplished by first calculating the relative binding affinities for the two RGD peptides from the competitive inhibition study. This ratio was calculated to be 9.0 and was then used to correlate the effects of the two RGD sequences by dividing the incorporated density for the linear peptide by this relative binding affinity ratio. When this was done, the RGD-dependent neurite outgrowth for the adjusted linear RGD peptide (Fig. 3, ▴) was strikingly similar to that for the cyclic RGD peptide (Fig. 3, ▵). Therefore, it is very likely that the lower density of the higher affinity cyclic peptide, which induced maximal neurite outgrowth represents a total adhesive character similar to the higher density of the lower affinity linear peptide, which induced maximal neurite outgrowth as well. This is further supported in that the levels of enhancement of neurite outgrowth for these two formulations are of similar intensities. Within the concentration series tested, both RGD peptides demonstrated a similar adhesive-like character in three-dimensional migration, and this character corresponds directly to effects seen in the two-dimensional studies. It has been recently demonstrated that integrin number in the growth cone is regulated by receptor occupancy. Neurons were purified from embryonic chick DRGs and plated on surfaces coated with either a low or high concentration of the extracellular matrix protein laminin or the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin. When the amount of a laminin-specific integrin receptor, α6β1, was analyzed, it was shown to have increased in the presence of low concentrations of laminin and decreased in the presence of high concentrations of laminin relative to similar neurons plated on fibronectin coated surfaces (30.Condic M.L. Letourneau P.C. Nature. 1997; 389: 852-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). This compensatory mechanism is hypothesized to enable the neurite to migrate over a very wide range of adhesion site densities. This compensatory mechanism may be less at play in the fibrin model employed, as a clear response of outgrowth rate to the adhesive characteristics of the matrix was observed. It also may be possible that this compensatory effect is even less at play in three-dimensional outgrowth, since high immobilized concentrations of the high affinity cyclic RGD ligand inhibited neurite outgrowth much more extensively in three-dimensional culture than in two-dimensional culture, approximately 2-fold more. The addition of exogenous adhesion sites within a fibrin matrix is sufficient for enhancing two- and three-dimensional neurite outgrowth. The overall process of neurite outgrowth involves the simultaneous coordination of many individual processes, including binding to both adhesion and other bioactive sites, polymerization of actin, formation of new membrane, and intracellular migration of proteins within the axon (31.Luckenbill-Edds L. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 1997; 23: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 32.Fu S.Y. Gordon T. Mol. Neurobiol. 1997; 14: 67-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar, 33.Bisby M.A. Tetzlaff W. Mol. Neurobiol. 1992; 6: 107-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). While each of these components are necessary for neurite migration, it is possible that modulating a single factor might not be sufficient to increase the overall rate of neurite migration. By cross-linking various concentrations of exogenous RGD peptides within a fibrin matrix formed from physiological fibrinogen concentrations, materials have been developed whereby the likely change is in the adhesive character of the material. These materials were able to modestly increase the level of neurite outgrowth, demonstrating that adhesion of the migrating neurite growth cone is a significant and rate controlling factor, even if it constitutes only one part of a complicated process. The use of biomaterials for tissue regeneration, such as the promotion of nerve healing, is a promising field of research. By developing materials with specific adhesive characteristics, it is possible to control and enhance the level of cell migration within the material. This may lead to more effective forms of therapy in many areas of tissue engineering, such as promoting better integration at the tissue-biomaterial interface, promoting cell infiltration, and controlling morphogenesis in tissue regeneration.

The mechanism underlying the biological activity of PBN is still controversial. However, PBN is a well known scavenger of radical species, although a variety of other well known spin traps or antioxidants do not mimic its anti-senescence activity in IMR90. 2H. Atamna, A. Paler-Martı́nez, and B. N. Ames, unpublished observation. 2H. Atamna, A. Paler-Martı́nez, and B. N. Ames, unpublished observation. PBN at relatively high concentrations reduces the production of hydrogen peroxide in mitochondrial preparations of cerebral cortex (10.Hensley K. Pye Q.N. Maidt M.L. Stewart C.A. Robinson K.A. Jaffrey F. Floyd R.A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2549-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and therefore may exert similar properties in vivo. This suggests that PBN possesses special properties that do not exist in other spin traps or antioxidants. In the course of our study of the effect of PBN on IMR90 cells we observed that old solutions were more effective than fresh solutions in delaying senescence of IMR90 cells. This raised the question about the interaction of the decomposition products of PBN with IMR90 cells. This encouraged us to test the anti-senescent effect of the PBN decomposition products, N-t-butyl hydroxylamine and benzaldehyde (Scheme FS1) on IMR90 cells. PBN (or PBN/⋅OH) has been reported to decompose toN-t-butyl hydroxylamine orN-t-butyl hydronitroxide and benzaldehyde (11.Chamulitrat W. Parker C.E. Tomer K.B. Mason R.P. Free Radic.

The antioxidative and protective features of some cyclic nitroxides/cyclic hydroxylamines are known. Probably the most important feature in this regard is their ability to catalyze superoxide radical dismutation to form H2O2(17.Zhang R. Goldstein S. Samuni A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 1245-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18.Samuni A. Krishna C.M. Mitchell J.B. Collins C.R. Russo A. Free Radic. Res.

In vitro cyclic nitroxides can either be oxidized to oxo-ammonium cation or reduced to the corresponding hydroxylamine by superoxide radical, depending on the type of cyclic nitroxide. Thus cyclic hydroxylamine or the corresponding oxo-ammonium cation are intermediates during the dismutation of superoxide radical by nitroxide. Interestingly, the oxo-ammonium cation species is reduced to the corresponding cyclic hydroxylamine by the cellular reductant NADH, which suggests that cyclic hydroxylamine can be the dominant form inside the cells. In addition the cyclic nitroxide species can undergo one electron reduction to the corresponding cyclic hydroxylamine, a reaction proposed to be mediated by mitochondrial coenzyme Q and ascorbic acid (21.Krishna M.C. Grahame D.A. Samuni A. Mitchell J.B. Russo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5537-5541Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 22.Swartz H.M. Free Radic. Res.

Biophys. 1987; 256: 232-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase can also oxidize the cyclic hydroxylamine to the corresponding nitroxide (24.Chen K. Glockner J.F. Morse P.D.d. Swartz H.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2496-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that mitochondria can contribute to the cycling of cyclic nitroxides/cyclic hydroxylamines, which in turn can facilitate dismutation of superoxide radical to H2O2. The N-t-butyl hydroxylamine and the other N-hydroxylamines tested in this study are primary N-hydroxylamines that have not been previously examined as antioxidants, although in comparison with the cyclic hydroxylamines described, one might expect similarities in their biochemical properties. We demonstrate in the present study the ability ofN-t-butyl hydroxylamine to delay the senescence of IMR90 cells. The ability of N-t-butyl hydroxylamine to exert this effect at concentrations much lower than that used for PBN together with increased potency of PBN preparations with longer storage time suggests that this decomposition product mediates the action of PBN on IMR90 cells. Benzaldehyde was without effect, and in high concentrations, was toxic to the cells. RelatedN-hydroxylamines, N-benzyl hydroxylamine, andN-methyl hydroxylamine have also been found to be active. N-t-Butyl hydroxylamine,N-benzyl hydroxylamine, N-methyl hydroxylamine (and the corresponding O-hydroxylamines), nitroso-tert-butane, 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO), 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (4-OH-TEMPO), 3-carba-moyl2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolidin-1-yloxy (3-CP), octanesulfonic acid, and methanesulfonic acid were purchased from Aldrich. Cytochrome c, Rho123 and xanthine, NADP, fluorocitrate, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and PBN were from Sigma. Xanthine oxidase was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Aldehyde-reactive probe was from Dojindo (Kumamoto, Japan). DCFH was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR).N,N′-bis(3,3′-(dimethylamino) propylamine)-3,4,9,10-perylene3-carbamoyl-tetracar3-carbamoyl-boxylic diimide (DAPER) was from Pierce. The ABC kit was from Victor labs (Burlington, CA). The DNA isolation QIAamp kit was from QIAgen (Valencia, CA). Normal human epithelial fibroblasts (IMR90) cells were obtained from the Coriell Institute for Medical Research at a population doubling level (PDL) of 10.85. The PDLs were calculated as log2(D/D o), whereD and D o are defined as the density of cells at the time of harvesting and seeding, respectively. Stock cultures were grown in 100-mm Corning tissue culture dishes containing 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (V/V) fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). Stock cultures were split once a week when near confluence. Cells were harvested by trypsinization for 5 min at 37 °C, immediately collected in 5 ml of complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, washed once with 5 ml of complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and incubated for 10–15 min at 37 °C to allow the cells to recover. To test the effect of hydroxylamines on replicative life span, IMR90 cells were seeded at 0.5 × 106/100-mm dish.N-Hydroxylamines (N-t-butyl hydroxylamine, N-benzyl hydroxylamine, N-methyl hydroxylamine) were added either individually (final concentration 10 or 100 μm) or in a combination of all threeN-hydroxylamines (30 μm each). The cultures were split after 7 days and seeded with fresh medium supplemented with the hydroxylamines described above. In other experiments the medium of the cultures was replaced after 3 days of seeding with fresh medium, and with fresh N-hydroxylamines, the split was done as usual after 7 days from seeding. The effect of other chemicals used in this study on the life span of the cells was tested as described above, and the effect of PBN on life span was tested as in (5.Chen Q. Fischer A. Reagan J.D. Yan L.J. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4337-4341Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of H2O2 on the replicative life span, cells were first seeded with fresh medium with or without N-hydroxylamines (see above) for a week. Next, cells grown with or without N-hydroxylamines were each split into two additional groups and then either 1) treated with 20 or 30 μm H2O2 or 2) left untreated, with H2O2. Aconitase was measured as described by Gardneret al. (25.Gardner P.R. Nguyen D.D. White C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12248-12252Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Briefly, IMR90 cells were grown with or withoutN-hydroxylamine as described above. After 12 weeks of treatment, the cells were washed twice by cold PBS and scraped from the dishes with a cell scraper. The cells (3–4 × 106) were collected by centrifugation and resuspended into 200 μl of ice-cold 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.6 mmMnCl2/20 μm fluorocitrate supplemented with antiprotease mixture (leupiptin, pepstatine, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg each). The cells were disrupted by three cycles of sonication for 3–5 s at low output separated by 1 min of incubation in ice. Then the lysate was spun at 12,000 × g for 5 min in 4 °C, and the supernatant was used to measure total soluble protein and aconitase activity. In general, 60–100 μg of protein are adequate to readily detect aconitase activity as described (25.Gardner P.R. Nguyen D.D. White C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12248-12252Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). IMR90 cells were trypsinized and resuspended into complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. For each condition, two tubes were prepared with 1 × 106 cells each. Tubes were then spun at 250 × g for 10 min at room temperature, and supernatant was replaced with 1 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution without Ca2+ or Mg2+. Rho123 (20 μl of 525 μm stock; 10.5 μm final concentration) was added to one tube, and DCFH (20 μl of 1.25 mm stock; 25 μm final concentration) was added to the other tube. The cells were then incubated in the dark in a water bath at 37 °C for 30 min followed by cell resuspension and centrifugation at 250 × g for 10 min at room temperature. The supernatant (500 μl) was removed from each tube, and the cells were resuspended in the remaining 500 μl before FACS analysis on a FACSort analyzer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Cell Quest was used for data acquisition and analysis. The data are reported as the mean of the channel of the fluorescence histogram obtained. Fluorescence output was calibrated with LinearFlow Green Flow cytometry intensity calibration particles (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). AP sites were measured according to H. Atamna and B. N. Ames. 3H. Atamna and B. N. Ames, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, IMR90 cells (1–2 × 106) in 0.5 ml PBS, 5 mm glucose were incubated with 3 mm aldehyde-reactive probe (ARP (26.Kubo K. Ide H. Wallace S.S. Kow Y.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3703-3708Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar)) for 60 min at 37 °C. The cells were then collected by centrifugation at room temperature and washed twice with 1 ml of PBS. DNA was isolated by the QIAamp blood kit, as suggested by the manufacturer. DNA was quantified by Picogreen, and 1 μg was transferred into 200 μl of elution buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.9), mixed with 14 μl of 5 m NaCl (the mole ratio of NaCl/dNTP should be 25,000–30,000), and incubated for 60 min at room temperature with 30 μl of freshly prepared avidin-HRP (ABC kit), prepared as described by the manufacturer but with avidin-HRP concentrations diluted 1:3 and the incubation volumes scaled down to 1 ml. The DNA-avidin-HRP complex (DNA-HRP) was separated from unbound avidin-HRP by gently mixing 65 μl of 1 mm DAPER with the DNA and incubated at room temperature for 5 min (the mole ratio of DAPER/dNTP should be 66). The DNA-DAPER precipitate was then collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 12,500 × g and washed twice with 1.5 ml of 0.17m NaCl, 20 mm Tris, 0.25% Tween 20, 1% bovine serum albumin, pH 8. The precipitate of DNA-HRP was suspended in 500 μl of ice-cold 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.3 and sonicated at output 1–2 watts for 5 s (Sonifier Cell Disruptor, model w185D, Branson) and cooled immediately. HRP activity was measured as an indicator of AP sites in DNA-HRP by using the chromogenic ImmunoPure TMB or the fluorogenic QuantaBlu substrate kits. The background control was established by performing a parallel analysis on calf thymus DNA. The standard curve for AP sites was constructed with 100 ng of DNA standard containing a known amount of uracil suspended in 50 μl of 10 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.5. The standard DNA was incubated with 25 μm spermine for 3 min and then with 3 units of uracil-DNA N-glycosylase for 20 min at 37 °C to catalyze the removal of uracil residues and generate AP sites. The resulting “AP-enriched” DNA was incubated with 3 mm ARP for 45 min at 37 °C. The standard DNA-ARP adducts were isolated from unbound ARP by QIAamp columns (without the protease step) and quantified. The number of AP sites was corrected for the loss of DNA during isolation (10–20% loss). The biotinylated DNA was incubated with avidin-HRP and processed as above. Superoxide radical was generated by the reaction of xanthine (120 μm) with xanthine oxidase (0.06 units). The reaction was performed at 25 °C in a final volume of 1 ml of PBS containing 40 μm cyt CFeIII. The reaction was started by the addition of the substrate xanthine.N-Hydroxylamines were added just before the addition of xanthine. The initial rate of reduction of cyt CFeIII was determined based on the linear change in absorbance at 550 nm. To test the effect of N-hydroxylamines on the spontaneous oxidation of cytochrome c, a complete reduction of cyt CFeIII was achieved by incubating the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system for 4–5 min at 25 °C. Auto-oxidation of cyt CFeII is associated with a decrease in absorbance at 550 nm. Reduced cytochrome c was incubated at 25 °C with or without 2 or 3 mm N-hydroxylamines, and the auto-oxidation was followed by spectrophotometer. The rate of reduction of cytochrome c by different concentrations of eachN-hydroxylamine was measured by the increase in absorbance at 550 nm. Cultivated IMR90 cells (≈3 × 106) were washed once in cold PBS and resuspended in 200 μl of ice-cold methanesulfonic acid (0.2 m methanesulfonic acid, 0.5 mm DTPA) and allowed to stand for 10 min at room temperature. Denatured proteins were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was filtered with 30,000 M r cut-off Ultrafree filters (Millipore) before injection. Fifty microliters were injected and separated on an HPLC column (3-μm 0.46 × 15-cm Suplecosil LC18-DB, Supelco, Bellefonte, PA) with a flow rate of 1 ml/min using a mobile phase consisting of 25 mmNaH2PO4, 5 mm octane sulfonic acid, and 2% acetonitrile adjusted to pH 2.7 with phosphoric acid (27.Lakritz J. Chang A. Weir A. Nishio S. Hyde D. Philpot R. Buckpitt A. Plopper C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 278: 1408-1418PubMed Google Scholar). An ESA model 5100A Coulochem detector, 5020 guard cell, and model 5010 analytical cell combination was used for analysis. Oxidation potentials of 900, 400, and 880 mV were used for guard cell and electrodes 1 and 2, respectively. Full-scale output was 10 μA, and peak areas were compared using commercial GSH and GSSG as standards. N-t-Butyl hydroxylamine, N-benzyl hydroxylamine, andN-methyl hydroxylamine (N-hydroxylamines, SchemeFS1) at 100 μm (added once per 7 days) delay senescence of IMR90 cells by at least 17–20 PDLs (Fig.1). The concentration of PBN required to achieve a similar gain in PDLs is eight times higher thanN-hydroxylamines (Table I and Ref. 5.Chen Q. Fischer A. Reagan J.D. Yan L.J. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4337-4341Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). The minimal concentration of N-hydroxylamines required to achieve a gain of 5–7 PDLs above the untreated control was 20 times lower than that for PBN (200 μm) to achieve 2–3 PDLs (Table I and Ref. 5.Chen Q. Fischer A. Reagan J.D. Yan L.J. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4337-4341Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). For each of the threeN-hydroxylamines, when they were added to IMR90 cells every 3 days at 25 μm, they were twice as efficient as 100 μm every 7 days (data not shown). None of theN-hydroxylamines tested were toxic at the concentration applied to the cells, as measured by PDL, whereas benzaldehyde, the co-product of PBN hydrolysis, was without effect or toxic at high concentrations (data not shown). All the N-hydroxylamines at the concentrations tested were much more effective than PBN in delaying senescence. The N-hydroxylamines studied appear to be equally efficient in delaying senescence, with a variation only when cells were close to senescence (late PDLs, Fig. 1 A). We have developed a new HPLC-electrochemical detection method forN-hydroxylamines. We find, using this method, thatN-t-butyl hydroxylamine rapidly enters cells and reaches saturating concentrations after 1–2 min (55–65 nmol/mg of protein (12 × 106 cells)), which is approximately 5-fold the extracellular concentration, 1 mm.3Table IThe gain in PDLs of cultured IMR90 cells after continuous cultivation with PBN and N-t-butyl hydroxylamines compared to control untreated cellsTreatmentGain in PDLs800 μmPBN14.8200 μm PBN2.4100 μm NtBHA19.710 μmNtBHA5.8IMR90 cells were cultured in the presence of various compounds and PDL followed until senescence.

A simultaneous treatment of the cells with all three of theN-hydroxylamines (30 μm each) yielded results similar to single treatments, delaying senescence by 14–17 PDLs. In contrast, at concentrations equivalent to theN-hydroxylamines, the isomeric O-hydroxylamines were either without effect (O-t-butyl hydroxylamine) or induced a small decline in the final PDL (O-benzyl hydroxylamine and O-methyl hydroxylamine) (Fig. 1 B). We tested the ability of the cyclic nitroxides TEMPO, 4-OH-TEMPO, and 3-CP to delay senescence of IMR90 cells. None of these nitroxides delayed senescence at 25 μm; moreover, a decline of about 8–9 PDLs was observed at 100 μm. Also, we tested nitroso-tert-butane (tNB), a potential generator of nitric oxide (NO), for its effect on the life span of IMR90 cells. We found that tNB is toxic at 50 μm and has no effect on the cells at concentration of 10 μm. Senescencedependent change in mitochondria of IMR90 cells was estimated by Rho123. The Rho123 fluorescence that accumulated in the cells was measured weekly by FACS for a total of at least 8 weeks and plotted against the current PDL (i.e. age of the cells). The age-dependent incorporation of Rho123 in IMR90 is biphasic (Fig. 2). This is characterized by a slow and linear increase at early PDLs, followed by a shorter and steeper phase at late PDLs. Linear regression analysis was used to calculate the rate of Rho123 accumulation as a function of PDL (Table II). The regression analysis was based on early PDLs only; late PDLs were not included in the analysis (Fig. 2). The increment in accumulation of Rho123 indicates a senescence-dependent change in the mitochondria of IMR90 cells as they became senescent. N-Hydroxylamines delay these changes in mitochondria, and the rate of Rho123 accumulation as a function of senescence decreased by 70, 69, and 52% forN-t-butyl hydroxylamine, N-benzyl hydroxylamine, and N-methyl hydroxylamine, respectively (Table II).Table IIRate of Rho123 accumulation and DCFH oxidation per PDL in IMR90 cells treated with N-hydroxylaminesTreatmentDCFH, AFU/PDLRho123, AFU/PDLr 2r 2Control, PBS2.18 (0.73)31.7 (0.67)NtBHA (100 μm)0.27 (0.32)9.3 (0.85)NBHA (100 μm)0.11 (0.08)9.7 (0.86)NMHA (100 μm)0.45 (0.3)15.3 (0.86)IMR90 cells were treated with N-hydroxylamines beginning at PDL 24–27.

The level of oxidants was measured each week by estimating the oxidation of DCFH (28.LeBel C.P. Ischiropoulos H. Bondy S.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (2190) Google Scholar) in the living cells. Measurements of fluorescence of oxidized DCFH were made weekly by FACS for total of at least 8 weeks and plotted against the current PDL (i.e. age of the cells), and a biphasic curve similar to that seen with Rho123 fluorescence was observed with DCFH fluorescence (data not shown). A linear regression analysis was used to calculate the initial linear rate of DCFH oxidation as a function of PDL (Table II). The regression analysis was based on early PDLs only. Late PDLs were not included in the analysis. IMR90 cells treated continuously with N-hydroxylamines exhibit a slower rate of formation of oxidants compared with control cells. The percent of decrease in the rate of oxidant formation from control are 88, 95, and 79% for N-t-butyl hydroxylamine, N-benzyl hydroxylamine, andN-methyl hydroxylamine, respectively (Table II). The level of AP sites in DNA can be used as a measure of the level of oxidative damage. IMR90 cells treated simultaneously with the threeN-hydroxylamines (30 μm each) showed a 52% reduction in AP sites compared with PDL matched control cells (Fig.3). A 2–3-fold age-dependent decline in the activity of aconitase is seen in old (high PDL) compared with young (low PDL) IMR90 cells (Fig.4). The age-dependent decline in the activity of aconitase was largely prevented when the cells were grown with N-hydroxylamines. The efficiency of protecting aconitase from inhibition was as follows;N-t-butyl hydroxylamine (90%) ≥N-benzyl hydroxylamines (75%) ≫ N-methyl hydroxylamine (17%, Fig. 4).

https://openalex.org/W2027505727,"We have identified cDNAs encoding three isoforms (a1, a2, and a3) of the 100-kDa a subunit of the mouse vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase (V-ATPase). The predicted protein sequences of the three isoforms are 838, 856, and 834 amino acids, respectively, and they display approximately 50% identity between isoforms. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that all three isoforms are expressed in most tissues examined. However, the a1 isoform is expressed most heavily in brain and heart, a2 in liver and kidney, and a3 in liver, lung, heart, brain, spleen, and kidney. We also identified multiple alternatively spliced variants for each isoform. Reverse transcriptase-mediated polymerase chain reaction revealed that one splicing variant of the a1 isoform (a1-I) was expressed only in brain, whereas two other variants (a1-II and a1-III) were expressed in tissues other than brain. These alternatively spliced forms differ in the presence or absence of 6–7 amino acid residues near the amino and carboxyl termini of the proteins encoded. The a3 isoform is also encoded by three alternatively spliced variants, two of which are predicted to encode a protein that is truncated near the border of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains of the a subunit and therefore lacks the integral transmembrane-spanning helices thought to participate in proton translocation. Expression of each isoform (with the exception of a1-I) was detectable at all developmental stages investigated, with a1-I absent only in day 7 embryos. The results obtained suggest that isoforms of the 100-kDa a subunit may contribute to tissue-specific functions of the V-ATPase."

In this study, we examined the role of cGMP in regulating the store-operated Ca2+ entry in aortic endothelial cells. Cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) and thapsigargin, two selective inhibitors of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, were used to induce store-operated Ca2+ entry. 8-Bromo-cGMP, an activator of protein kinase G, inhibited the CPA- or thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ entry in a concentration-dependent manner. An inhibitor of protein kinase G, KT5823 (1 μm) or H-8 (10 μm), abolished the inhibitory action of 8-bromo-cGMP and resumed Ca2+ entry. Addition ofS-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (a nitric oxide donor) or dipyridamole (a cGMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor) during CPA treatment elevated cellular cGMP levels, stimulated protein kinase G activity, and at the same time reduced Ca2+ influx due to CPA. Patch clamp study confirmed the existence of a CPA-activated Ca2+-permeable channel sensitive to cGMP inhibition. These results suggest that cGMP via a protein kinase G-dependent mechanism may play a key role in the regulation of the store-operated Ca2+ entry in vascular endothelial cells.

These results suggest that cGMP via a protein kinase G-dependent mechanism may play a key role in the regulation of the store-operated Ca2+ entry in vascular endothelial cells. cytoplasmic free calcium concentration protein kinase G bromo cyclopiazonic acid phosphate-buffered saline normal physiological saline solution calcium-free physiological saline solution S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine Ca2+ influx in nonexcitable cells regulates such diverse processes as gene regulation, contraction, exocytosis, and apoptosis. In these cells, the predominant Ca2+ entry pathway is the store-operated one (1.Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar), in which Ca2+ entry is governed by Ca2+ content of intracellular Ca2+ stores. Release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores causes store depletion, which then activates Ca2+entry from extracellular space. This Ca2+ entry, which has been termed the store-operated Ca2+ entry, may be the basis by which these cells maintain elevated [Ca2+]i 1and replenish their intracellular Ca2+ stores in response to agonist stimulation (1.Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). The importance of this signaling pathway has been recognized in numerous investigations and has received a great deal of attention (1.Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). However, up to now, the mechanism by which this Ca2+ entry pathway is regulated has still been poorly understood.At least in some cell types, activation of store-operated Ca2+ entry appears to involve a soluble messenger that is generated at the endoplasmic reticulum and that is capable of modulating plasma membrane Ca2+ permeability. A putative mediator termed the Ca2+ influx factor has been identified in Jurkat T lymphocytes (2.Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). Store-operated Ca2+ entry may also be regulated by several other factors, including small molecular weight G proteins (3.Bird G. St J. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21486-21488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Fasolato C. Hoth M. Penner R. J. Biol.

J. 1994; 303: 337-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).There is a controversy as to whether cGMP plays a key regulatory role in store-operated Ca2+ entry. Several research groups proposed that cGMP could activate the store-operated Ca2+entry in pancreatic acinar cells (7.Bahnson T.D. Pandol S.J. Dionne V.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10808-10812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Xu X. Star R.A. Tortorici G. Muallem S. J. Biol.

Cell Calcium. 1995; 17: 250-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, subsequent studies by Putney and co-workers (10.Bian X. Bird G. St J. Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1996; 19: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 11.Gilon P. Obie J.F. Bian X. Bird G.S. Dagorn J.C. Putney Jr., J.W. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 645-656Google Scholar) failed to observe any effect of cGMP on thapsigargin-evoked Ca2+ influx in both pancreatic acinar cells and Jurkat T cells. Similarly, in Xenopus oocytes and rat basophilic leukemia cells, cGMP had no effect on store-operated Ca2+influx (4.Fasolato C. Hoth M. Penner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20737-20740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Parekh A.B. Penner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1993; 364: 814-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar).Vascular endothelial cells in vivo form an interface between flowing blood and vascular tissue, responding to numerous humoral and physical stimuli to secrete relaxing and contracting factors, which modulate the contractility of vascular smooth muscle cells. In many cases, the initial response of endothelial cells to these diverse signals involves Ca2+ release from intracellular stores (14.Himmel H.M. Whorton A.R. Strauss H.C. Hypertension (Dallas). 1993; 21: 112-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Like in other nonexcitable cells, depletion of intracellular stores activates Ca2+ entry in vascular endothelial cells (15.Pasyk E. Inazu M. Daniel E.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: H138-H146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Schilling W.P. Cabello O.A. Rajan L. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 521-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 17.Sharma N.R.

An increase in intracellular Ca2+ may then elevate cellular cGMP levels in endothelial cells (19.Luckhoff A. Pohl U. Mulsch A. Busse R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1988; 95: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 20.Moncada S. Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 108-143Google Scholar, 21.White D.G. Martin W. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1989; 97: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether this elevation in cellular cGMP may in any way influence the store-activated Ca2+ entry in vascular endothelial cells.This study was performed to assess the role of cGMP and protein kinase G (PKG) in the regulation of the store-operated Ca2+ entry in vascular endothelial cells. We found that an elevated cGMP level attenuated the store-operated Ca2+ entry and that this inhibitory effect might be mediated by a PKG-dependent mechanism. These results suggest that cGMP and PKG may play a key role in the regulation of the store-operated Ca2+ entry in vascular endothelial cells.RESULTSCPA is a mycotoxin from Aspergillus andPenicillium. It selectively inhibits endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase and prevents Ca2+ re-uptake, thereby stimulating Ca2+ entry by a mechanism independent of receptor stimulation and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formation. This chemical has become a major tool for depleting intracellular Ca2+ stores and activating store-operated Ca2+entry (1.Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar, 15.Pasyk E. Inazu M. Daniel E.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: H138-H146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this experiment, CPA was applied to induce store depletion. Ca2+ influx was then initiated by changing the extracellular medium from a Ca2+-free solution (0Ca2+-PSS) to a Ca2+-containing solution (N-PSS). Control cells without CPA pretreatment were washed in and then maintained briefly in 0Ca2+-PSS. For the control cells, there was no change in [Ca2+]i when external Ca2+ was elevated (Fig.1 A). In contrast, for those cells pretreated with 10 μm CPA, an elevation in external Ca2+ drastically increased [Ca2+]i(Fig. 1 A). These results suggest that depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores activates Ca 2+influx. A prolonged exposure of cultured cells to a Ca2+-free medium may also result in store depletion. We examined the relationship between cell exposure time in 0Ca2+-PSS and the subsequent Ca2+ influx triggered by elevation of extracellular Ca2+. Elevation of extracellular Ca2+ caused no change in [Ca2+]i for those cells incubated in 0Ca2+-PSS for up to 30 min. An incubation of 60 min in 0Ca2+-PSS resulted in the Ca2+ influx evoked by extracellular Ca2+. However, such a prolonged incubation in 0Ca2+-PSS often led to cell detachment from cultureware.To confirm that the CPA-induced increase in [Ca2+]i is indeed caused by Ca2+influx instead of Ca2+ release from CPA-insensitive intracellular stores, we used two known blockers of Ca2+entry. Ni2+ (3 mm), a potent blocker of Ca2+ entry that competes for Ca2+-binding sites (29.Winegar B.D. Kelly R. Lansman J.B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1991; 97: 351-367Google Scholar), completely blocked the increase in [Ca2+]i(Fig. 1 B). SKF-96365 (50 μm), an inhibitor of receptor-mediated Ca2+ entry (30.Cabello O.A. Schilling W.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), also abolished the rise in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 1 B). We also tested the effect of membrane depolarization on the rise in [Ca2+]i. 80 mm extracellular K+ completely suppressed the [Ca2+]irise due to CPA (Fig. 1 B). Membrane depolarization is known to reduce the driving force for Ca2+ entry (31.Adams D.J. Barakeh J. Laskey R. van Breemen C.V. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2389-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Therefore, these results are consistent with the concept that the CPA-induced rise in [Ca2+]i was caused by Ca2+influx.8-Br-cGMP was used to examine the effect of cGMP on store-operated Ca2+ entry. Application of 8-Br-cGMP reduced the [Ca2+]i rise due to CPA in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 of 180 μm (Fig.2 B). 8-Br-cGMP at 2 mm completely blocked the Ca2+ entry (Fig. 2,A and B). Since cGMP is an intracellular second messenger that activates PKG, we next examined the possible involvement of PKG. KT5823, a potent and highly specific PKG inhibitor (32.Grider J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G334-G340PubMed Google Scholar), and H-8, another PKG inhibitor, were used for this purpose. 1 μm KT5823 or 10 μm H-8 abolished the inhibitory action of 8-Br-cGMP and resumed the Ca2+ entry due to CPA (Fig. 2 A and B). These results suggest that store-operated Ca2+ entry in endothelial cells is regulated by a PKG-dependent mechanism. It appears that when PKG activity is blocked by KT5823 or H-8, 8-Br-cGMP is no longer able to stimulate PKG. The overall effect is an inhibition of PKG by KT5823 or H-8. The inhibition of PKG may then open the pathway for store-operated Ca2+ entry.Figure 2Effects of PKG modulators on CPA-induced rise in [Ca2+]i. Cells were placed in 0Ca2+-PSS with CPA for 40 min. Chemicals were introduced 5 min prior to the experiments.

(n = 6–12).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We then tested whether CPA-induced Ca2+ influx could be augmented by prior inhibition of PKG. In the presence of 1 μm KT5823 or 10 μm H-8, CPA-induced Ca2+ influx was significantly increased (Fig.3). For those cells treated with PKG inhibitors, an initial [Ca2+]i peak was followed by a rapid decrease in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 3). We speculate that quicker refillings of intracellular Ca2+stores under this condition may subsequently suppress Ca2+influx.Figure 3Effects of KT5823 and H-8 on CPA-induced rise in [Ca2+]i.

Corbin J.D. Boyer P.D. Krebs E.G. The Enzymes. 17. Academic Press, New York1986: 43-106Google Scholar). We thus tested the effect of 8-Br-cAMP on CPA-induced Ca2+ entry. Unlike cGMP, 2 mm 8-Br-cAMP had no effect on CPA-induced Ca2+entry (n = 15), suggesting that PKA is not involved.Store depletion has been reported to increase cellular cGMP in other nonexcitable cells (8.Xu X. Star R.A. Tortorici G. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12645-12653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To further explore the possible regulatory role of cGMP in store-operated Ca2+ entry, we tested the effect of CPA on cellular cGMP levels in vascular endothelial cells. Fig.4 illustrates that CPA (10 μm) stimulated cGMP production in vascular endothelial cells. Maximal stimulation occurred at 10 min after addition of CPA. At this time point, CPA increased cGMP levels by 13-fold. SNAP (100 μm), a NO donor (34.Southam E. Garthwaite J. Neurosci. Lett. 1991; 130: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and dipyridamole (10 μm), an inhibitor of cGMP phosphodiesterase (35.Weishaar R.E. Burrows S.D. Kobylarz D.C. Quade M.M. Evans D.B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1986; 35: 787-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), were also used to elevate cellular cGMP levels. Addition of SNAP or dipyridamole during CPA treatment further raised cellular cGMP (Fig.5 B) and almost abolished the Ca2+ influx due to CPA (Fig. 5 A). Endogenous PKG was also stimulated, with its activity raised to ∼95% of its maximal activity (Fig. 5 C).Figure 4Effect of CPA on cGMP content of rat aortic endothelial cells. Cells were treated with CPA. At the indicated times, samples were extracted with ethanol to determine cGMP content. The cGMP content in the control cells without CPA treatment was normalized to 1. Values represent means ± S.E. (n= 6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)For all the above experiments, we also used thapsigargin, another selective inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (1.Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar, 36.Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (2986) Google Scholar), as an independent tool to evaluate our findings obtained from CPA experiments. When thapsigargin was used to activate Ca2+ influx, results similar to those with CPA were observed (data not shown).These data strongly suggest that a PKG-sensitive Ca2+ entry pathway may play an important role in store-operated Ca2+entry. However, they give no indication as to whether this pathway plays a role in the maintenance of [Ca2+]i under basal unstimulated conditions. An attempt was therefore made to address this issue. Cultured endothelial cells were bathed in a normal physiological solution containing 1 mm Ca2+without CPA pretreatment. Application of 2 mm 8-Br-cGMP caused only a slight decrease in intracellular Ca2+(n = 10). On the other hand, treatment of the cells with 1 μm KT5823 caused a large increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig.6 A). The KT5823-induced rise in [Ca2+]i resulted from Ca2+ influx since it was rapidly blocked by 3 mm Ni2+ (Fig.6 B). These data suggest that the basal Ca2+entry through the PKG-sensitive pathway may be low. On the other hand, opening of this Ca2+ entry pathway can significantly increase [Ca2+]i.Figure 6Effect of KT5823 on resting [Ca2+]i. Cells were placed in N-PSS, which contained 1 mm CaCl2. At the time indicated by the upward arrows, 1 μm KT5823 was added. Thedownward arrow illustrates the point at which 3 mm NiCl2 was added.

(n = 4–12).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We also tested the effect of H-8 on resting [Ca2+]i of the cells bathed in normal physiological solution without CPA pretreatment. However, unlike KT5823, H-8 (10 μm) did cause any immediate rise in [Ca2+]i. One possibility is that the inhibition of PKG by H-8 might be slow, probably due to slow diffusion of the chemical across the plasma membrane to its targeted site. Any increase in [Ca2+]i due to slow opening of this PKG-sensitive Ca2+ influx pathway may be cancelled out by other [Ca2+]i-reducing mechanisms such as plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase and endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase. Therefore, the net change in [Ca2+]i might be very little.A patch clamp technique was used to search for store depletion-activated channels in isolated aortic endothelial cells. A Ca2+-permeable channel was identified in the cell-attached mode with the bath solution being KCl saline and the pipette solution being CaCl2 saline. Fig. 7(A–C) shows the single channel current traces recorded in a typical experiment. Fig. 7 (E–G) shows the corresponding amplitude histograms. The current traces were recorded with the patch potential held at −100 mV. A very low level of channel activity could be observed immediately after the formation of a gigaohm seal (Fig. 7,A and E). CPA treatment drastically increased the channel activity (Fig. 7, B and F). A subsequent application of 1 mm 8-Br-cGMP in the presence of CPA completely abolished the channel activity (Fig. 7, C andG). A unitary current amplitude of −1.0 ± 0.5 pA was calculated by fitting with two gaussian functions. The single channelI-V relationship from the same patch is displayed in Fig. 7 D. This CPA-activated channel was observed in 11 out of 62 cell-attached membrane patches. Among these 11 patches, seven had long-lasting good seals, which made the subsequent cGMP treatment possible. cGMP treatment abolished CPA-induced channel activity in all seven membrane patches. For three membrane patches that lasted even longer, we applied 1 μm KT5823. KT5823 resumed the channel activity in all three patches. The slope conductance and the extrapolated reversal potential were obtained by linear regression. The average slope conductance and the reversal potential from seven different patches were 9.1 ± 1.4 picosiemens and 22 ± 5 mV, respectively. The conductance of this channel was not changed after application of CPA. Since this channel reversed at a positive voltage under our experimental conditions, it should be a Ca2+-permeable channel.Figure 7A CPA-inducible Ca2+-permeable channel sensitive to the inhibition of cGMP.

CPA or thapsigargin treatment activated Ca2+ entry from extracellular space as indicated by an elevation in intracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 1 A). Several lines of evidence suggest that the rise in [Ca2+]i is caused by Ca2+ influx instead of Ca2+ release from CPA- or thapsigargin-insensitive intracellular stores. 1) The increase in [Ca2+]i is evoked by application of Ca2+ to extracellular solution. 2) It is blocked by Ni2+ and SKF-96365. 3) It is abolished by membrane depolarization induced by 80 mm external K+(Fig. 1 B).Fig. 2 illustrates that the store-operated Ca2+ entry in endothelial cells can be inhibited by 8-Br-cGMP in a concentration-dependent manner. PKG inhibitors KT5823 and H-8 reverse the inhibitory effect of 8-Br-cGMP. These data suggest that the store-operated Ca2+ entry is subjected to modulation by cGMP through a PKG-dependent mechanism. We propose that cGMP and PKG may be crucial components in controlling store-operated Ca2+ entry at least in aortic endothelial cells.In pancreatic acinar cells, depletion of intracellular Ca2+stores is known to stimulate production of NO, which subsequently activates guanylate cyclase, leading to an elevation of cellular cGMP (8.Xu X. Star R.A. Tortorici G. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12645-12653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results from Fig. 4 indicate that store depletion elevates cellular cGMP levels in cultured endothelial cells as well. Our proposed model is that the elevated cGMP may in turn inhibit Ca2+ entry via a PKG-dependent pathway, therefore providing a negative feedback mechanism through which Ca2+ influx is finely regulated depending upon intracellular contents of Ca2+, cGMP, and NO. NO is a crucial signal in the regulation of vascular tone. It is conceivable that vascular endothelial cells may need such a fine regulatory mechanism for a better control of vascular tone. This feedback mechanism also allows the cells to avoid detrimental effects of excessive [Ca2+]i and/or NO. Excessive [Ca2+]i or NO may lead to apoptosis and cell death (37.Murphy M.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 401-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 38.Balligand J.L. Cannon P.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1845-1858Crossref Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Our model predicts that the inhibition of PKG will substantially augment CPA-induced Ca2+ influx. This is indeed confirmed by the experiments in Fig. 3, which show that, in the presence of KT5823 (1 μm) or H-8 (10 μm), CPA-induced Ca2+ influx is augmented.Although CPA elevates cellular cGMP levels and stimulates PKG activity in endothelial cells, PKG is not maximally activated (Fig.5 C). The elevated PKG activity is not enough to offset the Ca2+ influx triggered by CPA-induced store depletion. SNAP and dipyridamole were used to further increase the cellular cGMP levels in the presence of CPA. These treatments cause additional increases in cellular cGMP and PKG activity (Fig. 5, B and C) and almost abolish the Ca2+ influx due to CPA (Fig.5 A).It is likely that this PKG-sensitive Ca2+ entry plays only a limited role in the maintenance of [Ca2+]iunder basal unstimulated conditions. PKG activity is substantial even without CPA treatment (Fig. 5 C). Treatment of cultured endothelial cells with 2 mm 8-Br-cGMP causes no significant change in [Ca2+]i, whereas the inhibition of PKG by 1 μm KT5823 causes a rapid and significant increase in Ca2+ entry (Fig. 6. A and B). These results suggest that this Ca2+ influx pathway is mostly closed by PKG phosphorylation under basal unstimulated conditions. However, this Ca2+ influx pathway may open under the condition of store depletion, presumably through a PKG-independent pathway such as production of the Ca2+ influx factor or activation of tyrosine kinase (2.Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar, 3.Bird G. St J. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol.

On the other hand, store depletion may stimulate the production of cGMP (Fig. 4), which then initiates the PKG-dependent feedback mechanism. The presence of two separate control mechanisms, one that positively stimulates Ca2+ entry via the Ca2+ influx factor or tyrosine kinase and the other that negatively attenuates Ca2+ entry through PKG, allows intracellular Ca2+ to be finely regulated.With the use of the patch clamp technique, we have recorded a CPA-activated Ca2+-permeable channel from isolated endothelial cells in the cell-attached mode (Fig. 7). Its properties appear to be similar to those of the channel previously reported by Zhang et al. (39.Zhang H. Inazu M. Weir B. Buchnan M. Daniel E. Eur. J.

When the pipette is filled with high concentrations of CaCl2, both channels reverse at a positive voltage with the single channel conductance around 7–9.5 picosiemens. In this study, we demonstrated that the activity of this channel is inhibited by bath application of 1 mm 8-Br-cGMP (Fig. 7, C and G). A subsequent application of KT5823 (1 μm) can resume the channel activity. It is likely that this particular Ca2+-permeable nonselective cation channel might be the target for CPA stimulation and PKG phosphorylation.Our conclusion that cGMP inhibits the store-operated Ca2+entry in vascular endothelial cells is not consistent with previously published data in other nonexcitable cells. Available reports on other nonexcitable cells suggest that an increase in cGMP from the basal level either activates store-operated Ca2+ entry or has no effect (4.Fasolato C. Hoth M. Penner R. J.

However, these models fail to explain how zwitterionic polysaccharides (Zps) confer protection against intraabdominal abscess formation in a T cell-dependent manner. Here, we demonstrate that Zps elicit a potent CD4+ T cell response in vitro that requires available major histocompatibility complex class II molecules on antigen-presenting cells. Specific chemical modifications to Zps show that: 1) the activity is specific for carbohydrate structure, and 2) the proliferative response depends upon free amino and carboxyl groups on the repeating units of these polysaccharides. Peptides synthesized to mimic the zwitterionic charge motif associated with Zps also exhibited these biologic properties. Lysine-aspartic acid (KD) peptides with more than 15 repeating units stimulated CD4+ T cells in vitro and conferred protection against abscesses induced by bacteria such as Bacteroides fragilis andStaphylococcus aureus. Evidence for the biologic importance of T cell activation by these zwitterionic polymers was provided when human CD4+ T cells stimulated with these molecules in vitroand adoptively transferred to rats in vivo conferred protection against intraabdominal abscesses induced by viable bacterial challenge.

The recent demonstration that non-peptide-containing mycobacterial lipid and glycolipid antigens activate T cells in conjunction with CD1 molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs)1 has broadened our understanding of antigens capable of T cell recognition (1.Sieling P.A. Chatterjee D. Porcelli S.A. Prigozy T.I. Mazzaccaro R.J. Soriano T. Bloom B.R. Brenner M.B. Kronenberg M. Brennan P.J. Modlin R.L.

In those studies, the carbohydrate component of mycobacterial glycolipids was, in part, responsible for influencing T cell responses. This observation supported earlier work in which T cell recognition of glycoproteins was shown to be dependent on the content and distribution of sugar residues in these structures (4.Michaelsson E.

The Gram-negative anaerobe Bacteroides fragilis is the most common bacterial isolate from intraabdominal abscesses in humans (9.Gorbach S.L. Thadepalli H. Norsen J. Anaerobic Microorganisms in Intraabdominal Infections. Charles C. Thomas, Springfield, Illinois1974: 399-407Google Scholar,10.Polk B.J. Kasper D.L. Ann. Intern. Med. 1977; 86: 567-571Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In a rat model simulating human intraabdominal sepsis, B. fragilis, but not other anaerobic bacterial species, has the distinct ability to induce abscesses when implanted into the peritoneal cavities of animals (11.Kasper D.L.

Science. 1993; 262: 416-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Anaerobic species other than B. fragilis require co-administration with a facultative organism to induce abscesses. Recently, we have shown that prophylactic or therapeutic subcutaneous administration of a capsular polysaccharide from this organism, PSA, aborts the formation of intraabdominal abscesses in rats challenged with B. fragilis or other intestinal bacteria capable of synergistically stimulating abscess formation (15.Tzianabos A.O. Kasper D.L. Cisneros R.L. Smith R.S. Onderdonk A.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2727-2731Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Studies aimed at understanding the cellular basis of protection against abscess formation demonstrated that splenic T cells obtained from PSA-treated animals confer protection when transferred to animals challenged with these abscess-inducing bacteria (15.Tzianabos A.O.

Kasper D.L. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 4881-4886Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies suggested that PSA possessed novel immunomodulatory properties affecting T cell function. PSA is a polysaccharide composed of oligosaccharide repeating units possessing constituent sugars with free amino and carboxyl groups (Fig.1). The presence of oppositely charged groups on the same bacterial polysaccharide is distinctly uncommon because most polysaccharides contain either neutral or negatively charged groups. The presence of the free amino and carboxyl group on the PSA repeating unit is critical to its biologic function. Specific chemical neutralization of either of these charged substituents abrogates its ability to protect against abscess formation in animals (16.Tzianabos A.O. Onderdonk A.B. Zaleznik D.F. Smith R.S. Kasper D.L. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 4881-4886Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of B. fragilis PSA to elicit a protective host response that is dependent on T cells suggested an interaction between PSA and this cell type. In this study, we present defined chemical evidence that Zps are able to activate T cells. Proof that it is the charge motif that is critical for this activity was provided when chemical elimination of the charged group on the polysaccharide resulted in failure of these molecules to activate T cells. Furthermore, similarly charged microbial polysaccharides or peptides synthesized to mimic the charge motif of Zps activated T cells in vitro, and this interaction was functionally important in protection against abscess formation. PSA was prepared from B. fragilis as described previously (17.Tzianabos A.O. Pantosti A. Baumann H. Brisson J.R. Jennings H.J. Kasper D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18230-18235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Baumann H. Tzianabos A.O. Brisson J.R. Kasper D.L. Jennings H.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4081-4089Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). PSA used for proliferation experiments was subjected to isoelectric focusing in a Rotofor apparatus (Bio-Rad) to obtain the molecule in a disaggregated state (17.Tzianabos A.O. Pantosti A. Baumann H. Brisson J.R. Jennings H.J. Kasper D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18230-18235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following this procedure, the preparation was dialyzed against deionized water to remove ampholyte, lyophilized, and stored in 3 m NaCl to prevent aggregation. For some experiments, PSA was chemically modified to assess the role of structure on T cell activation. All modifications are shown in Fig.1. Treatment with acetic anhydride was used to convert all free amino groups on Sugar 1 to N-acetyl groups (Modification I) as described previously (18.Baumann H. Tzianabos A.O. Brisson J.R. Kasper D.L. Jennings H.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4081-4089Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In addition, the saccharide was treated with 37% formaldehyde in the presence of sodium cyanoborohydride in order to convert the free amino group on PSA repeating unit to a tertiary dimethylamine such that it retained a positive charge (Sugar 1, Modication II). This conversion was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy, as evidenced by the resonance at 2.9 ppm (singlet) arising from the methyl protons of the dimethylamine. The negatively charged carboxyl groups associated with the pyruvate substituent were reduced by carbodiimide-mediated reduction (Sugar 3, Modification III) (18.Baumann H. Tzianabos A.O. Brisson J.R. Kasper D.L. Jennings H.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4081-4089Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The pyruvate ring was also removed by treatment with 5% acetic acid at 80 °C for 1 h (Sugar 3, Modification IV). The loss of the pyruvate group was confirmed by proton NMR in which a signal at 1.5 ppm due to the methyl proton of the pyruvate group disappeared after treatment. NMR analysis also revealed that other components of the PSA repeating unit were not affected by this treatment. In order to demonstrate the specificity of T cell activation by PSA, this polymer was chemically oxidized with sodium metaperiodate (NaIO4) as described previously (19.Paoletti L.C. Kasper D.L. Michon F. DiFabio J. Jennings H.J. Tosteson T.D. Wessels M.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This chemical treatment selectively cleaves the C–C bond between vicinal hydroxyl groups found on carbohydrates. In the case of PSA, periodate oxidation (0.01 m NaIO4 for 90 min at room temperature) specifically cleaves C-6 from the galactofuranose side-chain (Sugar 4, Modification V), leaving an aldehyde group (CHO) at C-5. Subsequent modification of the oxidized PSA involved reduction with sodium borohydride (NaBH4) to reduce the aldehyde at C-5 to a hydroxymethyl group (Sugar 4, Modification VI) that converts the galactofuranose side-chain to arabinofuranose. Hydrolysis of this polysaccharide with 4 m trifluoroacetic acid for 2 h at 125 °C and subsequent analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of the resultant alditol acetate derivative demonstrated that >95% of the galactofuranose residues had been converted to arabinofuranose upon oxidation and reduction. PSA was treated with 30% hydrogen peroxide (2 h at room temperature), which oxidizes thiol-containing amino acids to sulfone derivatives but does not affect carbohydrate structure. All structural analyses of PSA and chemical modifications thereof were confirmed by NMR spectroscopy. The Streptococcus pneumoniae type 1 and type 3 capsular polysaccharides (CPs) were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA) and treated with 2 m NaOH for 1 h at 80 °C to remove the contaminating cell wall polysaccharide, C substance. Following purification by gel filtration chromatography, the S. pneumoniae polysaccharides were subjected to isoelectric focusing, dialyzed, lyophilized, and stored in 3 m NaCl to prevent aggregation. The free amino group of the type 1 CP was chemically modified in two separate experiments. This group was converted to anN-acetyl moiety by treatment with acetic anhydride or converted to a tertiary amine by treatment with formaldehyde in the presence of sodium cyanoborohydride as described above for PSA. These chemical modifications were confirmed by NMR spectroscopy as described above. β-Glucan (Alpha-Beta Technology, Worcestor, MA) was used as a negative polysaccharide control for some studies. Peptides (KD)n were synthesized on a Rainin Symphony peptide synthesizer. Peptides were prepared with 4-alkoxybenzyl alcohol resins (PerSeptive Biosystems Inc., Framingham, MA) using Fmoc chemistry. Amino acids were activated with 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3 tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate for coupling. The peptides prepared were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. Mass spectra were acquired on a Voyager matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometer. Proton NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker AMX500 instrument with proton frequency of 500 MHz. Both analyses confirmed that the peptides were the expected structures. Preparations of poly-l-lysine with molecular masses ranging from 1000 to 4000 daltons were obtained commercially (Sigma). All peptides were subjected to isoelectric focusing as described above. T cell proliferation assays were performed on cells obtained from human leukopacs (discarded white cells from anonymous platelet donors) as described previously (20.Haregewoin A. Soman G. Hom R.C. Finberg R.W. Nature (Lond.). 1989; 340: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 21.Finberg R.W. White W. Nicholson-Weller A. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2055-2060PubMed Google Scholar). Mononuclear cells were separated by Ficoll-Hypaque sedimentation to eliminate red cells and polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The mononuclear layer, which consisted of T cells, B cells, and mononuclear cells was depleted of B cells and monocytes by passage over nylon wool column. A portion of these cells was saved prior to placement on nylon wool and used as autologous feeder cells following irradiation with 6.4 krad with a cesium source for 4.8 min. Nylon-passed cells, which were more than 98% CD3-positive (as determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis), were used as responder cells or further depleted with antibodies to CD4 (OKT4) or CD8 (OKT8) followed by negative selection with magnetic beads as described (20.Haregewoin A. Soman G. Hom R.C. Finberg R.W. Nature (Lond.). 1989; 340: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 21.Finberg R.W. White W. Nicholson-Weller A. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2055-2060PubMed Google Scholar). Responder cells (5 × 104 cells/well) were added to 2.5 × 105irradiated feeder cells and cultured in U-bottomed 96-well plates (Corning-Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) with RPMI 1640 and 5% fetal calf serum. At predetermined time points, cells were pulsed with 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine/well 6 h prior to harvest in order to measure cell proliferation. Cells were washed extensively and harvested, and the amount of radioactive uptake was counted by liquid scintillation. Data were expressed as the average of triplicate wells ± the S.D. of cpm represented. For all proliferation experiments, data represent typical results from at least five different experiments. For antibody blocking experiments, T cells and APCs were mixed with LB3.1 (20 μg/ml), a class II specific monoclonal antibody (anti-DR) for 20 min at 37 °C. An isotype matched monoclonal antibody, 5E2B4, was added to cultures as an irrelevant control. Following incubation with antibody, S. pneumoniae type 1 CP was added (20 μg/ml) and allowed to incubate for 6 days, at which time proliferation was assessed as described above. The rat model of intraabdominal sepsis developed by Onderdonk was used (22.Onderdonk A.B. Bartlett J.G. Louie T. Sullivan-Seigler N. Gorbach S.L. Infect. Immun. 1976; 13: 22-26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Male Lewis rats (180–200 g, Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were used for all experiments. Animals were housed separately and received chow (Ralston Purina, St. Louis, MO) and water ad libitum. Animals were anesthetized with a single intraperitoneal injection of 0.15 ml of Nembutal (50 mg/ml, Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL), and their abdomens were shaved and swabbed with a tincture of iodine. An anterior midline incision (1 cm) was made through the abdominal wall and peritoneum, and a gelatin capsule containing 0.5 ml of inoculum was inserted into the pelvis. The incisions were closed with interrupted 3.0 silk sutures, and the animals were returned to the cages. The inoculum contained a 1:1 mixture of B. fragilis NCTC 9343 (108cfu/animal) or S. aureus PS 80 (107 cfu/animal, a kind gift from Dr. Jean Lee, Channing Laboratory, Harvard Medical School) and an adjuvant solution containing sterile rat cecal contents and 10% barium sulfate (w/v). Six days later, animals were necropsied in a blinded fashion and examined for the formation of one or more intraabdominal abscesses. Animal care was in accordance with the institutional guidelines set forth by Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Cell transfer experiments were performed as described previously (15.Tzianabos A.O. Kasper D.L. Cisneros R.L. Smith R.S. Onderdonk A.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2727-2731Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Human CD4+ T cells were purified as described above and cultured in vitro with irradiated APCs in the presence of PSA or KD20 (20 μg/ml) for 5 days. T cells were harvested, examined for viability by trypan blue exclusion, and further enriched by passage over nylon wool (more than 95% pure CD4+ T cells as assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis). Purified T cells were then counted and adjusted to an appropriate cell number (3 × 106/animal) prior to intracardiac transfer to animals (0.2 ml). Animals were challenged withB. fragilis 24 h later and assessed for abscess formation 6 days later. Comparison of abscess formation between groups of animals was made by χ2 analysis, whereas comparison of groups in T cell proliferation assays was made by Student's t test (InStat, GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego CA). In proliferation assays with human T cells, PSA elicited a dose-dependent response (dose range, 10–0.1 μg/ml; Fig.2 A). This proliferative response peaked 6 days after culture with PSA. When tested at an optimal concentration of 1 ng/ml, the proliferative response to staphylococcal enterotoxin A also peaked at day 6 (Fig. 2). The depletion of T cells from these preparations abrogated the proliferative activity, whereas depletion of B cells did not (data not shown). In previous studies, we have demonstrated the importance of the free amino group at C-4 of the 2-acetamido-4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxygalactose residue of PSA (Fig. 1, Sugar 1) and the carboxyl group associated with the pyruvate group on Sugar 3 in mediating in vivo biologic functions (14.Tzianabos A.O. Onderdonk A.B. Rosner B. Cisneros R.L. Kasper D.L. Science. 1993; 262: 416-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 16.Tzianabos A.O. Onderdonk A.B. Zaleznik D.F. Smith R.S. Kasper D.L. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 4881-4886Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Tzianabos A.O. Russell P.R. Onderdonk A.B. Gibson 3rd, F.C. Cywes C. Chan M. Finberg R.W. Kasper D.L. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 893-897PubMed Google Scholar). In light of these data, we assessed the role of these chemical groups on T cell activation by PSA. A specific chemical modification converted the free amino groups on PSA toN-acetyl groups (Fig. 1, Sugar 1, Modification I). N-Acetylation of PSA abrogated T cell activation by PSA, a result indicating that free amino groups on PSA are critical for T cell activation (Fig. 2 B, PSA versus PSA : NAc). Furthermore, conversion of this group to a tertiary amine that still retains its positive charge (−HN+(CH3)2) by treatment with an aldehyde group under reducing conditions (as shown in Fig. 1,Modification II) significantly reduced T cell proliferation (medium control = 1123 ± 510 cpm; PSA = 11,215 ± 763 cpm; formaldehyde-treated PSA = 1256 ± 439 cpm). Chemical modification of the carboxyl group associated with the pyruvate substituent on PSA via carbodiimide-mediated reduction (Fig.1, Sugar 3, Modification III) resulted in a 72% decrease in the proliferative response as compared with the unmodified PSA (tested at 20 μg/ml, 7937 ± 3264 cpm versus 27,886 ± 7890 cpm, respectively). This finding was supported by experiments in which the pyruvate ring was completely removed by acid hydrolysis (Fig.1, Sugar 3, Modification IV), resulting in complete abrogation of the proliferative effect (medium = 750 ± 375 cpm; PSA (20 μg/ml) = 25,714 ± 1429; acid-treated PSA (20 μg/ml) = 552 ± 171 cpm). We have carefully considered the possibility that the T cell proliferative response to PSA could reflect the presence of protein or peptide contamination. The following data specifically address this issue. 1) Purification of surface polysaccharides from B. fragilis involved procedures designed to degrade or denature proteins (extraction with hot phenol, repeated Pronase digestion, and boiling in 1M NaOH for 1 h) (24.Pantosti A. Tzianabos A.O. Onderdonk A.B. Kasper D.L. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 2075-2082Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, quantitative protein assays, and amino acid analysis reflected the absence of protein in polysaccharide samples. 3) Due to its charge motif, PSA ionically aggregates in aqueous solution, causing PSA to lose its ability to stimulate T cell proliferation. It is necessary to disaggregate this ionic complex via isoelectric focusing shortly before use for T cell activation to occur (data not shown). 4) Chemical treatment of PSA, which specifically alters carbohydrates but not proteins, abrogated proliferation by PSA. However, chemical regeneration of the affected carbohydrate groups restored T cell activation. For the last set of experiments, PSA was chemically oxidized by sodium metaperiodate (NaIO4) treatment, which is selective for the cleavage of the C–C bond between vicinal hydroxyl groups on carbohydrates. In the case of PSA, periodate oxidation is exquisitely specific for removing the C-6 of the galactofuranose side chain (Fig. 1, Sugar 4, Modification V), creating an aldehyde group at C-5. When tested for T cell proliferation, periodate-oxidized PSA failed to elicit a response (Fig. 2 B, PSA versus PSA : oxidized). After periodate oxidation, PSA was reduced with NaBH4, converting the aldehyde group at C-5 to a hydroxymethyl group (Fig. 1, Sugar 4, Modification VI). This modification resulted in the conversion of the side-chain sugar to an arabinofuranose residue but left the original motif of the charged groups on the polysaccharide intact. The regeneration of the side-chain hydroxymethyl group on oxidized PSA restored the proliferative activity of this polysaccharide (Fig.2 B, PSA versus PSA : oxidized/reduced). NMR spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry confirmed that >95% of the repeating units were modified as described. Generally, proteins are highly resistant to NaIO4oxidation; however, it is possible that this treatment could oxidize thiol groups present in cysteine residues associated with proteins or peptides to sulfoxide derivatives (25.March J. Advances in Organic Chemistry. 4th Ed. John Wiley & Sons, New York1992: 1202-1222Google Scholar). If this were the case, reduction with NaBH4 could reverse the oxidation procedure to regenerate this affected amino acid. Therefore, the results described above might be attributed to contamination by peptides containing cysteines. To eliminate this remaining possibility, PSA was treated with hydrogen peroxide, which oxidizes thiol groups on cysteine to sulfoxide derivatives (25.March J. Advances in Organic Chemistry. 4th Ed. John Wiley & Sons, New York1992: 1202-1222Google Scholar) but does not affect carbohydrate structure. T cell proliferation assays with hydrogen peroxide-treated PSA revealed that the proliferative activity was equivalent to that of the untreated polysaccharide (Fig. 2 B, PSA versus PSA : peroxide). We next determined whether another bacterial polysaccharide with a charge motif similar to PSA could activate T cells in vitro. S. pneumoniae type 1 CP is among the few naturally occurring polysaccharides that have oppositely charged groups (26.Lindberg B. Lindqvist B. Lonngren J. Powell D.A. Carbohydr. Res. 1980; 78: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The type 1 CP is a trisaccharide repeating unit that has the same sugar residue with a positively charged free amino group (2-acetamido-4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxygalactose residue) that occurs in PSA, and it has two galacturonic acid residues containing negatively charged carboxyl groups per repeating unit. In previous studies, we have demonstrated that, like PSA, the type 1 CP also protects animals against abscess formation (16.Tzianabos A.O. Onderdonk A.B. Zaleznik D.F. Smith R.S. Kasper D.L. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 4881-4886Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This protective activity is also dependent on the presence of the free amino group on its repeating unit structure. When tested for CD4+ T cell proliferation, this polysaccharide (after disaggregation by isoelectric focusing) yielded a response that peaked after 6 days of culture (Fig.3 A). T cell proliferation assays performed with S. pneumoniae type 3 capsule, which is a disaccharide repeating unit of glucose and glucuronic acid (27.Reeves R.E. Goebel W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1941; 139: 511-519Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and has only one negatively charged group per repeating unit, did not yield a response (Fig. 3 A). As demonstrated with B. fragilis PSA, N-acetylation of the type 1 CP abrogated the proliferative response (Fig. 3 B). Conversion of the free amino group of the type 1 CP to a tertiary dimethylamine that retained its positive charge resulted in a significant decrease in the proliferative activity. The activity of the treated polysaccharide was 3.5 times less active than the untreated control polysaccharide (Fig.3 C, p < 0.001). These results correlated with our findings with B. fragilis PSA in which the same chemical treatment also resulted in loss of activity. In order to demonstrate the role of the zwitterionic charge motif in T cell activation, a dipeptide repeating unit was synthesized to mimic the repeating unit structure of PSA. For this purpose, different repeating unit sizes of lysine and aspartic acid were synthesized and tested for their ability to stimulate CD4+ T cells. KD peptides consisting of 15, 20, or 25 repeating units each stimulated T cell activation in vitro (Fig. 4). However, peptides consisting of less than 15 repeating units (1, 5, and 10 repeats) did not stimulate T cell activation. Testing of a peptide with positively charged groups only, poly-l-lysine, did not stimulate T cell proliferation (data not shown). These data clearly indicate that zwitterionic repeating unit polymers other than polysaccharides stimulate T cell activation and that this activity depends on the repeating unit size of the polymer. We next investigated whether these peptides could protect animals against abscess formation in vivo. Animals were administered 50 or 5 μg of the 25-repeating-unit KD peptide and challenged with B. fragilis. The results are shown in TableI, Experiment A. Treatment with the higher dose of (KD)25 yielded significant protection in animals compared with the saline-treated control group (17% compared with 78%, respectively; p < 0.0005). However, treatment with the lower dose of the peptide failed to protect.S. pneumoniae type 1 CP yielded significant protection of animals at the 50-μg dose but not at the 5-μg dose. Administration of poly-l-lysine at the higher dose did not protect against abscess formation. Finally, treatment of animals with (KD)25 protected animals against intraabdominal abscess formation by S. aureus (Table I, Experiment B). Animals treated with saline and challenged with S. aureus had a 80% abscess rate, whereas treatment with 50 μg of (KD)25reduced abscess formation to 20% (p < 0.02).Table IProtection against abscess formation by the peptide KDTreatmentDoseAbscess formationPvalueaCompared with saline-treated"

In this report, we investigated the biotransformation of oxidized products of atRA via glucuronidation. For this purpose, we synthesized 4-hydroxy-RA (4-OH-RA) in radioactive and nonradioactive form, 4-hydroxy-retinyl acetate (4-OH-RAc), and 5,6-epoxy-RA, all of which are major products of atRA oxidation. Glucuronidation of these retinoids by human liver microsomes and human recombinant UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) was characterized and compared with the glucuronidation of atRA. The human liver microsomes glucuronidated 4-OH-RA and 4-OH-RAc with 6- and 3-fold higher activity than atRA, respectively. Analysis of the glucuronidation products showed that the hydroxyl-linked glucuronides of 4-OH-RA and 4-OH-RAc were the major products, as opposed to the formation of the carboxyl-linked glucuronide with atRA, 4-oxo-RA, and 5,6-epoxy-RA. We have also determined that human recombinant UGT2B7 can glucuronidate atRA, 4-OH-RA, and 4-OH-RAc with activities similar to those found in human liver microsomes. We therefore postulate that this human isoenzyme, which is expressed in human liver, kidney, and intestine, plays a key role in the biological fate of atRA. We also propose that atRA induces its own oxidative metabolism via a cytochrome P450 (CYP26) and is further biotransformed into glucuronides via UGT-mediated pathways.

It has been well established that atRA and some of its metabolites modulate expression of a set of genes involved in apoptosis, cellular growth and differentiation, and embryonic development (13.Chambon P.

In addition, atRA is currently used as a chemotherapeutic agent against promyelocytic leukemia (15.Muindi J.R.F. Frankel S.R. Huselton C. DeGrazia F. Garland W.A. Young C.W. Warrell R.P.

Furthermore, the glucuronidated atRA derivative, RAG, has been shown to be less cytotoxic than the parent atRA, while retaining its potency for driving cell growth, differentiation, and proliferation (12.Blaner W.S.

Characterization of the enzymatic metabolism of atRA will provide significant insight into the regulation of retinoid homeostasis. The purpose of the present work was to examine phase II metabolism of atRA and identify the human UGTs (EC 2.4.1.17) involved in the glucuronidation of atRA, 4-OH-RA, 4-oxo-RA, 5,6-epoxy-RA, and 4-OH-RAc (structures shown in Fig. 1). UGTs catalyze the conjugation of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds to d-glucuronic acid derived from UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcUA). This converts the metabolites into a more polar form, promoting their excretion in urine and/or bile. However, several examples of bioactivation of parent compounds via glucuronidation have been reported (21.Abbot F.V. Palmour R.M.

In this work, human liver microsomal UGTs and recombinant isoforms from both families were evaluated for their ability to catalyze glucuronidation of retinoids in various stages of oxidation. To obtain the appropriate substrates for these studies, we synthesized 4-OH-RAc, 5,6-epoxy-RA, and both radioactive and nonradioactive forms of 4-OH-RA. The studies in this report center on examining the glucuronidation of atRA, 4-OH-RA, 4-oxo-RA, 5,6-epoxy-RA, and 4-OH-RAc by human liver microsomes and the human recombinant UGTs, 1A3 and 2B7. Human liver UGT2B7 is involved in the glucuronidation of a large variety of endogenous and exogenous substrates including bile acids, steroids, and a variety of xenobiotics (26.Ritter J.K. Sheen Y.Y.

All retinoids were stored at −20 °C under argon, and all synthetic reactions were also carried out under argon. Stock solutions of the retinoids were prepared fresh in methanol (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA), and all procedures involving these compounds were performed in the dark or under yellow light. Diazald®(N-methyl-N-nitroso-p-toluenesulfonamide), sodium borohydride, bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide, all deuterated NMR solvents, and hydrogen peroxide (∼30%) were purchased from Aldrich, and the H2O2 solution was quantified by iodometric titration. Phthalic anhydride was purchased from Eastman Kodak Co., and manganese dioxide (MnO2) was purchased from Fluka (Milwaukee, WI). All other reagents were of the highest commercially available quality. Racemic 5,6-epoxy-RA (2) was synthesized by epoxidation of atRA (31.Wertz P.W. Kensler T.W. Mueller G.C. Verma A.K. Boutwell R.K. Nature. 1979; 277: 227-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) with monoperoxyphthalic acid, which was synthesized by a reaction of phthalic anhydride with alkaline H2O2 as described elsewhere (32.Vogel A.I. A Test-Book of Practical Organic Chemistry. 3rd Ed.

The formation of the oxirane was quantitative as evidenced by TLC analysis using ethyl acetate-hexane (40:60 or 50:50, v/v) as the mobile phase. The reaction mixture was washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate, water, and saturated NaCl. The ethereal layer was dried over anhydrous MgSO4, and solvent was removed in vacuo. The oxirane was recrystallized from diethyl ether/hexane (84% yield). Mass and 1H NMR spectra were obtained for the corresponding methyl ester, which was synthesized by reaction of the free acid with ethereal diazomethane prepared as described below: EI-MSm/z 330 (M+), 315 (M − CH3)+, 299 (M − OCH3)+, 271 (M − CO2CH3)+; 1H NMR (500 MHz, Me2SO-d 6) d (ppm) 6.97 (dd, J = 15.0, 15.3 Hz, 1H), 6.42 (d, J = 15.1 Hz, 1H), 6.25 (d, J = 6.5, 11.1 Hz, 2H), 6.04 (d, J = 15.7 Hz, 1H), 5.78 (s, 1H), 2.26 (s, 3H), 1.95 (s, 3H), 1.73 (brs, 2H), 1.37 (brs., 2H), 1.09 (s, 3H), 1.08 (s,3H), 0.85 (s, 3H).

The product was purified by silica gel chromatography using ethyl acetate-hexane (10:90, v/v) as the mobile phase, which afforded a yield of 78%: EI-MS m/z 342 (M+), 327 (M − CH3)+, 298 (M − CO2)+, 282, 267, 249, 145 (base peak); IR (cm−1) 1685 (α,β-unsaturated carbonyl), 1242, 1735 (ester), 1380–1365 (CH3 [acetate]); 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3) d (ppm) 1.19 (s, 6H), 1.86 (s,3H), 1.84 (m, 2H), 1.90 (s, 3H), 1.99 (s,3H), 2.07 (s, 3H), 2.51 (t, 2H), 4.74 (d, 2H), 5.66 (t, 1H), 6.22 (d, 1H), 6.27 (d, 1H), 6.32 (d, 1H), 6.37 (d, 1H), 6.64 (dd, 1H). 4 (0.5 g, 1.5 mmol) was dissolved in 50 ml of methanol, an equal volume of water was added, and the mixture was stirred at 4 °C. An excess of NaBH4 was added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed at 4 °C for 15 min and then for 1 h at room temperature. The reaction mixture was neutralized with phosphate buffer and extracted with ethyl acetate. The pooled ethyl acetate extracts were washed with water and subsequently dried over MgSO4. 5 was subsequently purified by silica gel chromatography using ethyl acetate as the mobile phase, which afforded a 75% yield (EI-MS m/z 344 (M+), 326 (M − H2O)+). In order to verify the presence of a hydroxyl group using mass spectrometry, the trimethylsilyl derivative was prepared by reaction of the acetate with bis(trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide): EI-MS m/z 416 (M+). atRA (1.0 g, 3.3 mmol) was dissolved in 25 ml of anhydrous diethyl ether (note: not all of the atRA may dissolve) to which distilled ethereal diazomethane (∼50–100 mmol) was added, and the reaction was allowed to sit for 1 h at room temperature, after which the ether phase was removed under a stream of argon. The ethereal diazomethane was prepared by reaction of Diazald® with NaOH using a Diazald® kit (Aldrich). The reaction was shown to be quantitative as evidenced by TLC analysis using ethyl acetate/hexane or benzene (20:80 v/v) as mobile phases. EI-MS of 6 demonstrated a molecular ion ofm/z 314 (M+) (base peak), as well as fragmentation ions of 299 (M − CH3)+, 282, 267, 159, 119, and 105. 6(1.04 g, 3.3 mmol) was reacted with MnO2 (30 g) by stirring at room temperature in CH2Cl2 (200 ml) for 72 h. The MnO2 was removed by filtration, the solvent was removed in vacuo, and the product was purified by silica gel chromatography using ethyl acetate/hexane (10:90 v/v) as the mobile phase.

The corresponding free acid (10) was prepared by hydrolysis of 4-oxo-methylretinoate (7). A solution of 7(0.5 g, 1.5 mmol) in methanol (40 ml) was reacted with aqueous NaOH (6n, 40 ml) for 4 h at room temperature and then added to aqueous H2SO4 (500 ml, 1 n). The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate, and the pooled ethyl acetate extracts were washed with water and saturated NaCl, dried over MgSO4, and solvent was removed in vacuo. 10 was subsequently purified by recrystallization from diethyl ether/hexane (86% yield), and its purity was verified by analytical reverse phase HPLC analysis and UV spectroscopy as described previously (31.Wertz P.W. Kensler T.W. Mueller G.C. Verma A.K. Boutwell R.K. Nature. 1979; 277: 227-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). 7 (0.6 g, 1.8 mmol) was dissolved in 50 ml of methanol, an equal volume of water was added, and the mixture was stirred at 4 °C. An excess of NaBH4 was added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed at 4 °C for 15 min and then for 1 h at room temperature. The reaction mixture was neutralized with phosphate buffer and extracted with ethyl acetate. The pooled ethyl acetate extracts were washed with water and subsequently dried over MgSO4. 8 was subsequently purified by silica gel chromatography using 20% ethyl acetate/hexane as the mobile phase, which afforded a 61% yield.

The corresponding free acid (9) was obtained by hydrolysis of 8. A solution of 8 (0.35 g, 1.1 mmol) in methanol (40 ml) was reacted with aqueous NaOH (6 n, 40 ml) for 4 h at room temperature and then acidified to pH 5.0 with citrate buffer (3 m). This buffer was used for acidification because we have shown that higher proton concentrations result in significant acid-catalyzed dehydration of the alcohol (data not shown). The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate, the pooled ethyl acetate extracts were washed with water and dried over MgSO4, and solvent was removed in vacuo. 9 was subsequently purified by recrystallization from diethyl ether/hexane (81% yield). The purity of the latter was verified by analytical reverse phase HPLC analysis and UV spectroscopy as described previously (33.Samokyszyn V.M. Chen T. Maddipati K.R. Franz T.J. Lehman P.A. Lloyd R.V. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1995; 8: 807-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). 50 mg of 10 (0.159 mmol) was dissolved in 1.5 ml of methanol and 0.5 ml of 2-propanol, followed by the addition of 0.2 ml of 1 m NaOH (0.2 mmol). To this mixture, 20 μl of 0.1 m NaBH4 (2 μmol, in 0.01 n NaOH) was added. After 2 h, the mixture was transferred to a vial containing 5 mCi of NaB3H4 (204 mCi/mmol, 24.5 μmol). The reaction was allowed to proceed overnight, and the course of the reaction was followed by TLC using ethyl acetate-hexane (40:60, v/v) as the mobile phase. Subsequently, NaBH4 (30 mg) was added in order to assure reduction of any unreacted ketone. After 2 h, the mixture was acidified to pH 6 using 1 m acetic acid and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase was washed with water and dried over Na2SO4, and the solvent was removed in vacuo. The yield was 64% (36 mg) with a specific activity of 32 mCi/mmol. The product was shown to be pure by analytical reverse phase HPLC, as described in the previous section. The human liver microsomes used in the experiments were from a 56-year-old man who had died of cerebral bleeding (HLM15) and from a 13-year-old girl who died from brain damage (HLM18). These samples were obtained from the University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands. The HLM served as a control for the glucuronidation assays by providing a basis of comparison for recombinant UGTs. Human recombinant UGT1A3 was expressed in a mammalian expression system as described previously (34.Mojarrabi B. Butler R. Mackenzie P.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). UGT2B7 was expressed in human embryonic kidney (HK293) cells as reported previously (28.Coffman B.L. Rios G.R. King C.D. Tephly T.R. Drug Metab. Disp. 1997; 25: 1-4PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Coffman B.L. King C.D. Rios G.R. Tephly T.R. Drug Metab. Disp. 1998; 26: 73-77PubMed Google Scholar). Enriched endoplasmic reticulum membrane fractions were prepared as described previously (35.Battaglia E. Pritchard M. Ouzzine M. Fournel-Gigleux S. Radominska A. Siest G. Magdalou J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The membrane fractions were stored at −80 °C in 5 mm HEPES, 0.25m sucrose, 20 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.4). The enzymatic activity of the recombinant UGT proteins was sustained for up to 6 months under these conditions. UGT activity was measured with both radioactive and unlabeled forms of atRA and 4-OH-RA as the aglycons with UDP-GlcUA serving as the sugar donor (retinoid structures shown in Fig. 1). All retinoid substrates were prepared in the form of mixed micelles with Brij 58 (0.12%). The Brij 58 micelles both activated the enzyme and solubilized the retinoids. Human liver microsomes and recombinant UGTs (50 μg of protein) were used in the assays. All enzymatic assays were performed under yellow light. The amount of product formed was less than 10% of total substrate added and was linearly proportional to the amount of microsomal protein added. The retinoid derivatives (0.10 mm final concentration) were incubated in 100 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm saccharolactone, and 0.05% Brij 58 in a final volume of 60 μl. The reaction mixture was preincubated with the proteins at room temperature for 10 min before starting the reaction with the addition of either 50 mm UDP-GlcUA for radioactive retinoids (4.17 mmfinal concentration) or 20 mm [14C]-UDP-GlcUA (3.33 mm final concentration) for unlabeled retinoids. The reactions were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped with 20 μl of ethanol, vortexed and placed on ice. For TLC, 60 μl of the reaction mix was applied to the preadsorbent layer of a 19-channeled silica gel TLC plate (Baker Si250-PA (19C); VWR Scientific) after which the plates were dried and developed twice in chloroform-methanol-glacial acetic acid-water (65:25:2:4, v/v). These TLC conditions allowed for separation of carboxyl- and hydroxyl-linked glucuronides. After development, the plates were dried and subjected to autoradiography for 3–7 days at -80 °C. For the identification of the type of glucuronide biosynthesized (structures shown in Fig. 2), two methods were used. First, in addition to TLC in the acidic system described above, samples were chromatographed in an alkaline solvent system (ethanol-ethyl acetate-30% NH4OH, 45:45:10, v/v) to hydrolyze carboxyl glucuronides in the course of TLC. Alternatively, after completion of the incubations, 8 n NaOH was added to the incubation mixtures and the samples were incubated for an additional 30 min at room temperature to hydrolyze the carboxyl glucuronide. Controls without 8 n NaOH were run concurrently. Hydroxyl-linked glucuronides are stable under these experimental conditions. This procedure allowed clear determination of the formation of hydroxyl- and/or carboxyl-linked glucuronides (structures shown in Fig. 2). After development in chloroform-methanol-glacial acetic acid-water 65:25:2:4 (v/v), plates were dried and subjected to autoradiography for 3–7 days at −80 °C. When tritium-labeled substrates were used, plates were sprayed with En3Hance (NEN Life Science Products) before autoradiography. Glucuronide bands were localized using the autoradiographs, and silica gel containing labeled metabolites (or from corresponding areas in control lanes) was scraped into vials and radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting (LKB RackBeta 1214; Wallac Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Specific activities of enzymes are expressed as picomoles/min × mg of protein; where applicable, means ± S.E. are reported. To determineK m and V max for HLM15 and UGT2B7 with atRA and 4-OH-RA as substrates, the concentrations of atRA and 4-OH-RA were varied (1–200 μm [3H]RA or unlabeled 4-OH-RA), while the concentration of UDP-GlcUA was held constant (4 mm). Data were analyzed and Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters were determined using EnzymeKinetics software (Trinity Software, Campton, NH). Many of the retinoids used in the current study were synthesized because they are not commercially available. These include compounds 2-7 and9-11 (Schemes Figure FS1, Figure FS2, Figure FS3). Racemic 5,6-epoxyretinoic acid (2) was synthesized by reacting atRA (1)with monoperoxyphthalic acid (Scheme FS1). (±)-4-Hydroxyretinyl acetate (5) was synthesized by first oxidizing retinyl acetate (3) with manganese dioxide to afford 4-oxoretinyl acetate (4) and reduction of the latter with sodium borohydride to yield (5) (Scheme FS2). atRA (1) was esterified to the corresponding methyl ester (6) using ethereal diazomethane which was subsequently oxidized with manganese dioxide to produce 4-oxomethylretinoate (7) (Scheme FS3). The free acid (10) was prepared by saponification of the ester. Racemic 4-hydroxymethylretinoate (8) was prepared by reduction of (7) with sodium borohydride and (±)-4-hydroxyretinoic acid (9) was prepared by hydrolysis of (8.Ray W. Bain G. Yao M. Gottleib D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18702-18708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Tritiated (±)-4-hydroxyretinoic acid (11) was synthesized by reduction of (10) with NaB[3H]4. Human liver microsomes and human recombinant UGTs were assayed for glucuronidation activity toward atRA, 9-cis-RA, 13-cis-RA, 4-OH-RA, 4-OH-RAc, 5,6-epoxy-RA, and 4-oxo-RA (structures shown in Fig. 1). Two human recombinant UGTs were available; UGT1A3 and UGT2B7. The enzymatic activities of HLM15 and the recombinant proteins toward all retinoid substrates used are summarized in TableI. UGT2B7 had high activity toward the retinoid substrates (with the exception of 4-oxo-RA), with 4-OH-RA and 4-OH-RAc being the optimal substrates for glucuronidation by UGT2B7. UGT2B7 glucuronidated the retinoid substrates on the same level of activity as HLM15. atRA was glucuronidated by HLM15 and UGT2B7 at rates of 227 and 275 pmol/mg × min, respectively, and 4-OH-RA was glucuronidated at 4–6-fold higher rates by both HLM15 and UGT2B7. UGT1A3 also showed activity toward retinoid substrates.Table IGlucuronidation of atRA, 4-OH-RA, 4-OH-RAc, 5,6-epoxy-RA, and 4-oxo-RA by human liver microsomes and recombinant UGT1A3 and UGT2B7SubstrateEnzymatic activityHLMUGT1A3UGT2B7pmol/mg × minatRA227 ± 126aCarboxyl-linked glucuronides.13 ± 2aCarboxyl-linked glucuronides.275 ± 24aCarboxyl-linked glucuronides.4-Oxo-RA200 ± 51aCarboxyl-linked glucuronides.10 ± 1aCarboxyl-linked glucuronides.21 ± 5aCarboxyl-linked glucuronides.5,6-Epoxy-RA571 ± 67aCarboxyl-linked glucuronides.17 ± 1aCarboxyl-linked glucuronides.172 ± 2"

Hop binds independently to Hsp90 and to Hsp70 to form a Hsp90·Hop·Hsp70·Hsp40 complex that is sufficient to convert the GR to its steroid binding form, and this four-protein complex will form stable GR·Hsp90 heterocomplexes if p23 is added to the system (Dittmar, K. D., Banach, M., Galigniana, M. D., and Pratt, W. B. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 7358–7366). Hop has been considered essential for the formation of receptor·Hsp90 heterocomplexes and GR folding. Here we use Hsp90 and Hsp70 purified free of all traces of Hop and Hsp40 to show that Hop is not required for GR·Hsp90 heterocomplex assembly and activation of steroid binding activity. Rather, Hop enhances the rate of the process. We also show that Hsp40 is not essential for GR folding by the five-protein system but enhances a process that occurs less effectively when it is not present. By carrying out assembly in the presence of radiolabeled steroid to bind to the GR as soon as it is converted to the steroid binding state, we show that the folding change is brought about by only two essential components, Hsp90 and Hsp70, and that Hop, Hsp40, and p23 act as nonessential co-chaperones.

Inasmuch as the glucocorticoid receptor (GR)2 must be associated with Hsp90 for it to have steroid binding activity (5.Bresnick E.H. Dalman F.C. Sanchez E.R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4992-4997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), incubation of Hsp90-free GR with reticulocyte lysate results in generation of steroid binding activity in direct proportion to the number of GR·Hsp90 heterocomplexes that are assembled (6.Hutchison K.A.

Besides Hsp90 itself, the only component of this Hsp90-based chaperone system proven to be essential for both GR·Hsp90 heterocomplex assembly and unfolding of the steroid-binding cleft in the GR LBD is Hsp70 (12.Dittmar K.D.

Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3101) Google Scholar), and it possesses an intrinsic ATPase activity that is stimulated by Hsp40, the vertebrate homolog of the bacterial DnaJ protein. The ADP-bound conformation of Hsp70 has a high affinity for hydrophobic substrates, and Hsp40 (provided as the purified yeast homolog, YDJ-1) potentiates GR·Hsp90 heterocomplex assembly when it is present in the purified system at about one-twentieth the concentration of Hsp70 (15.Dittmar K.D. Banach M. Galigniana M.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7358-7366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). It has not been clear whether Hsp40 is essential for GR folding by the five-protein system or whether it enhances a process that occurs, albeit less effectively, when it is not present (15.Dittmar K.D. Banach M. Galigniana M.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7358-7366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In this work, we show that Hsp40 is not obligatory for the folding change that results in steroid binding activity. Like Hsp70, Hsp90 possesses a nucleotide-binding site in its amino terminus that acts as an ATP/ADP switch domain that regulates its conformation, with the ADP-bound conformation possessing high affinity for hydrophobic substrate (21.Sullivan W.

Biol. 1994; 14: 1956-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) that binds to the ATP-dependent conformation of Hsp90 and stabilizes it in that conformation (21.Sullivan W. Stensgard B.

Receptor-bound Hsp90 must achieve the ATP-bound conformation for the generation of hormone binding activity (24.Grenert J.P. Johnson B.D. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17525-17533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), and p23 binds to and stabilizes preformed steroid-binding GR·Hsp90 heterocomplexes in an ATP-independent manner (14.Dittmar K.D.

Thus, p23 is not essential for GR folding to the hormone-binding state, rather it stabilizes the GR·Hsp90 heterocomplex once the ATP-dependent conformation of Hsp90 has been achieved (14.Dittmar K.D.

The fact that p23 is not essential for the folding change is consistent with the fact that deletion of the p23 gene in yeast does not ablate GR action (25.Bohen S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3330-3339Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The final player in the five-protein assembly system was identified as a 60-kDa rabbit protein intermediate in receptor·Hsp90 heterocomplex assembly (26.Smith D.F. Sullivan W.P. Marion T.N. Zaitsu K. Madden B. McCormick D.J. Toft D.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) that was found to be the homolog of a human protein cloned by Honoré et al. (27.Honoré B. Leffers H. Madsen P. Rasmussen H.H. Vanderkerckhove J. Celis J.E. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 682-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that this protein binds independently to Hsp90 via a central tetratricopeptide repeat domain and to Hsp70 via an amino-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat domain to form a Hsp90·p60·Hsp70 complex. The 60-kDa protein is now called Hop for Hsp organizerprotein. Hop binds preferentially to the ADP-bound conformations of Hsp70 and Hsp90 (30.Johnson B.D. Schumacher R.J. Ross E.D. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3679-3686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In progesterone receptor·Hsp90 assembly studies in reticulocyte lysate, Hop has been shown to participate at an intermediate assembly stage that is considered to be obligatory for the formation of functional progesterone receptor·Hsp90 heterocomplexes (29.Chen S.

Hutchison K.A. Owens-Grillo J.K. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12833-12839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Indeed, the first step in assembly appears to be the formation of a Hsp90·Hop·Hsp70·Hsp40 complex that acts as a machinery to generate steroid binding activity (13.Dittmar K.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13047-13054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 15.Dittmar K.D. Banach M. Galigniana M.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 27894-27899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These complexes can be prepared simply by mixing purified components, or they can be immunoadsorbed from reticulocyte lysate with a monoclonal antibody against Hop (15.Dittmar K.D. Banach M. Galigniana M.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7358-7366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). When mixed with immunoadsorbed, Hsp90-free GR, the immunoadsorbed Hsp90·Hop·Hsp70·Hsp40 complex converts the GR to its steroid binding form in an ATP/Mg2+-dependent and K+-dependent manner (13.Dittmar K.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13047-13054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 15.Dittmar K.D. Banach M. Galigniana M.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol.

To properly study the mechanism by which the Hsp90-based chaperone machinery is able to open the steroid-binding cleft to access by ligand, we must first determine the components that are obligatory to the process. Here we use the purified assembly system to demonstrate that Hop is not essential for GR folding. Rather Hop enhances the rate of a folding change carried out by only two essential components: Hsp90 and Hsp70. [6,7-3H]Triamcinolone acetonide (38 Ci/mmol) and125I-conjugated goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgGs were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Untreated rabbit reticulocyte lysate was from Green Hectares (Oregon, WI). Protein A-Sepharose and goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugates were from Sigma, and donkey anti-rabbit IgG was from Pierce. The BuGR2 monoclonal IgG antibody against the GR was from Affinity Bioreagents (Golden, CO). The AC88 monoclonal IgG against Hsp90, the N27F3–4 anti-72/73-kDa Hsp monoclonal IgG (anti-Hsp70), and anti-Hsp40 rabbit polyclonal antibody were from StressGen (Victoria, BC, Canada). The JJ3 monoclonal IgG against p23 and Escherichia coli expressing human p23 were gifts from Dr. David Toft (The Mayo Clinic). E. coliexpressing YDJ-1 was a gift from Dr. Avrom Caplan (Mount Sinai School of Medicine). The DS14F5 monoclonal IgG against Hop and E. coli expressing Hop were kindly provided by Dr. David F. Smith (University of Nebraska Medical School). Hybridoma cells producing the FiGR monoclonal IgG against the GR were generously provided by Dr. Jack Bodwell (Dartmouth Medical School). The baculovirus for mouse GR was kindly provided by Dr. Edwin Sanchez (Medical College of Ohio). Geldanamycin was obtained from the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch of the Developmental Therapeutics Program, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health. Sf9 cells were grown in SFM900 II serum-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with Cytomax (Kemp Biotechnology, Rockville, MD) in suspension cultures maintained at 27 °C with continuous shaking (150 rpm). Cultures were infected in log phase of growth with recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 3.0. Cultures were supplemented with 0.1% glucose at infection and 24 h post-infection as described by Srinivasan et al. (36.Srinivasan G. Post J.F.M. Thompson E.B. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 60: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested, washed in Hanks' balanced saline solution, resuspended in 1.5 volumes of buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm molybdate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and ruptured by Dounce homogenization. The lysate was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was collected, aliquoted, flash frozen, and stored at −70 °C. Receptors were immunoadsorbed from 50-μl aliquots of Sf9 cytosol by rotation for 2 h at 4 °C with 14 μl of protein A-Sepharose precoupled to 7 μl of FiGR ascites suspended in 200 μl of TEG (10 mm TES, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol). Prior to incubation with reticulocyte lysate or various mixtures of purified proteins as noted, immunoadsorbed receptors were stripped of associated Hsp90 by incubating the immunopellet an additional 2 h at 4 °C with 300 μl of 0.5 m KCl in TEG. The pellets were then washed once with 1 ml of TEG followed by a second wash with 1 ml of Hepes buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). In the experiment of Fig.7 B, the stripped immunopellets were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with 50 μl of HKD buffer (10 mm Hepes, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.35) and 5 μl of an ATP-regenerating system (50 mm ATP, 250 mm creatine phosphate, 20 mm MgOAc, 100 units/ml creatine phosphokinase). The pellets were then washed twice with 1 ml of TEG and once with 1 ml of Hepes buffer. This additional procedure of incubating the GR at 30 °C with ATP reduces the extent of receptor reactivation by about one-half but eliminates any trace activation by purified Hsp90. For immunodepletion of Hop, 60-μl aliquots of reticulocyte lysate were immunoadsorbed to 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose prebound with DS14F5 antibody against Hop or with nonimmune mouse IgG. The samples were rotated at 4 °C for 2 h, and immunopellets were washed three times with 1 ml of TEG buffer. After two rounds of immunoadsorption, Hop was undetectable by Western blot analysis in the supernatant fraction, and a 50-μl portion of the extracted lysate was used for reconstitution of the GR·Hsp90 heterocomplex. FiGR immunopellets containing GR stripped of chaperones were incubated with 50 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate or with various mixtures of proteins (20 μg of purified Hsp90, 15 μg of purified Hop-free and Hsp40-free Hsp70, 0.6 μg of purified human Hop, 6 μg of purified p23, 0.4 μg of purified YDJ-1) and adjusted to 50 μl with HKD buffer containing 20 mm sodium molybdate and 5 μl of the ATP-regenerating system. The assay mixtures were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with suspension of the pellets by shaking the tubes every 2 min. At the end of the incubation, the pellets were washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold TEGM buffer (TEG with 20 mm sodium molybdate) and assayed for steroid binding capacity and, in some experiments, for receptor-associated proteins. In the geldanamycin experiment of Fig. 5, an aliquot of a 10 mm stock solution of geldanamycin dissolved in Me2SO was diluted 100-fold into distilled water at room temperature, and this solution was added at one-tenth final volume to the heterocomplex assembly incubation. This yields a final concentration of 10 μm geldanamycin in 0.1% Me2SO (control samples received 0.1% Me2SO). It is important to note that the geldanamycin solution must be added to the incubation system immediately after it is diluted, because geldanamycin precipitates from the diluted solution such that 70–80% of the activity is lost by 4 h after it is diluted into water. Immune pellets to be assayed for steroid binding were incubated overnight at 4 °C in 50 μl HEM buffer plus 50 nm [3H]triamcinolone acetonide. Samples were then washed three times with 1 ml of TEGM and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The steroid binding is expressed as counts/min of [3H]triamcinolone acetonide-bound/FiGR immunopellet prepared from 50 μl of Sf9 cytosol. To assay GR and associated proteins, immune pellets were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes. The membranes were probed with 0.25 μg/ml BuGR for GR, 1 μg/ml AC88 for Hsp90, 1 μg/ml N27F3–4 for Hsp70, 0.1% DS14F5 mouse ascites for Hop, 0.5% anti-Hsp40, or 0.1% JJ3 mouse ascites for p23. The immunoblots were then incubated a second time with the appropriate 125I-conjugated or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated counter antibody to visualize the immunoreactive bands. Hsp90 and Hsp70 were purified from rabbit reticulocyte lysate by sequential chromatography on DE52, hydroxylapatite, and ATP-agarose as described previously (12.Dittmar K.D. Hutchison K.A. Owens-Grillo J.K. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12833-12839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In the first step of chromatography on DE52 the fractions containing Hsp90 (identified by immunoblotting) are combined such that Hop is eliminated (19.Hutchison K.A. Dittmar K.D. Czar M.J. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5043-5049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hsp40 is eliminated by conservative pooling of Hsp90 fractions in the DE52 and hydroxylapatite eluates as described previously (15.Dittmar K.D. Banach M. Galigniana M.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7358-7366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The low salt eluting fractions from DE52, which are pooled to form fraction pool A (shown in Ref. 19.Hutchison K.A. Dittmar K.D. Czar M.J. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5043-5049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), contain Hsp70, Hop, and Hsp40. When DE52 pool A is chromatographed on hydroxylapatite, the Hsp70 is completely separated from Hsp40 as we have shown previously (15.Dittmar K.D. Banach M. Galigniana M.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7358-7366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The Hsp70 fraction pool from hydroxylapatite is adsorbed to ATP-agarose, and the adsorbed Hsp70 is eluted with ATP followed by Amicon filtration and dialysis. Trace amounts of Hop are present in this final Hsp70 preparation, and the Hop was eliminated by incubating 200 μl of the final Hsp70 preparation with a 10-μl protein A-Sepharose pellet prebound with DS14F5 antibody. There is no immunodetectible Hop in the supernatant fraction, which is our purified Hsp40-free, Hop-free Hsp70. Human p23 (37.Johnson J.L. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24989-24993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was purified from 10 ml of bacterial lysate by chromatography on DE52 as described (15.Dittmar K.D. Banach M. Galigniana M.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7358-7366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) followed by hydroxylapatite chromatography. Fractions containing p23 were identified by immunoblotting, pooled, concentrated by Amicon filtration to ∼1.5 ml, dialyzed against HKD buffer, aliquoted, and stored at −70 °C. The bacterial expression of YDJ-1 has been described previously (38.Caplan A.J. Tsai J. Casey P.J. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18890-18895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Schumacher R.J. Hansen W.J. Freeman B.C. Alnemri E. Litwack G. Toft D.O. Biochemistry. 1993; 35: 14889-14898Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar) as has the expression of human Hop (12.Dittmar K.D. Hutchison K.A. Owens-Grillo J.K. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12833-12839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). For purification of YDJ-1, bacterial sonicates were cleared by centrifugation, and YDJ-1 was purified by sequential chromatography on DE52 and hydroxylapatite. The YDJ-1 containing fractions identified by immunoblotting were pooled, concentrated by Amicon filtration, dialyzed against HKD buffer, flash frozen, and stored at −70 °C. Purification of human Hop was carried out in a similar manner by sequential chromatography on DE52 and hydroxylapatite. It was shown previously that immunodepletion of Hop from reticulocyte lysate markedly reduced but did not eliminate its progesterone receptor·Hsp90 heterocomplex assembly activity (34.Chen S. Smith D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35194-35200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Similar immunodepletion of a DE52 fraction of reticulocyte lysate reduced but did not eliminate the ability of a system reconstituted from lysate subfractions to convert the GR to the steroid binding form (12.Dittmar K.D. Hutchison K.A. Owens-Grillo J.K. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12833-12839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In the experiment of Fig. 1 A, we have eliminated all immune detectible Hop from reticulocyte lysate by immunoadsorbing it twice with the DS14F5 antibody against Hop. Although this immune depleted lysate was less active at activating steroid binding activity of the GR, it was still half as effective as Hop-containing lysate extracted with nonimmune antibody (Fig.1 B). It could be argued that trace amounts of Hop that are not immunodetectible are responsible for the GR activation that occurs in the immunodepleted lysate. Thus, we tested the requirement for Hop in a purified, five-protein system that is very effective at GR·Hsp90 heterocomplex assembly. In the experiment of Fig. 2, stripped GR (lane 2) was incubated with the complete five-protein system (Hsp90, Hsp70, Hop, YDJ-1, and p23) (lane 3) or with all components of the system except one protein. At the end of the incubation, the immune pellets were washed and steroid binding activity was assayed. Elimination of Hsp90 (lane 4) or Hsp70 (lane 5) or the heterocomplex stabilizers p23 and molybdate (lane 8) reduced receptor activation to levels near that of the stripped receptor. Elimination of Hop (lane 6) reduced activation, but activation was still nearly 50% of that achieved by the complete system. In our previous reconstitution studies we have utilized GR immunoadsorbed from L cell cytosol where we reactivate 75–100% of the steroid binding activity with reticulocyte lysate (35.Hutchison K.A. Dittmar K.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27894-27899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this work, for the first time, we are reactivating mouse GR overexpressed in Sf9 cells, and we are immunoadsorbing much more GR protein. As shown in Fig. 2, the five-protein system actually generates more steroid binding activity (lane 3) than that of the unstripped receptor bound to insect Hsp90 (lane 1). Because there is so much GR protein in the immune pellets from Sf9 lysate, we can run lanes with standards of albumin or Hsp90 on the same gel and assay the amount of receptor by scanning the Coomassie Blue-stained proteins. Thus, from the specific activity of the bound [3H]triamcinolone acetonide, we can calculate that with reticulocyte lysate we reactivate ∼15% of the GR in the immune pellet and with the five-protein system we reactivate ∼12% of the receptors. The use of the Sf9 lysate saves us a tremendous amount of effort and expense, but for unknown reasons, only a fraction of the immunoadsorbed receptors are capable of binding steroid before stripping, and a much lower fraction of the stripped GR is reactivated than with GR immunoadsorbed from L cell cytosol. As shown in Fig. 3, readdition of purified Hop to a four-protein system of Hsp90, Hsp70, YDJ-1, and p23 produces a concentration-dependent restoration of activity. The inset shows an immunoblot of the incubation mix without added Hop (lane 1) to verify its absence in a system that nevertheless generated considerable (25,000 cpm) steroid binding activity. By comparing the intensity of bands developed with125I-labeled counter antibody in immunoblots containing aliquots of rabbit reticulocyte lysate and standard amounts of purified Hop, we estimate the concentration of Hop to be ∼0.5 μm, which is equivalent to ∼1.5 μg of purified Hop added to the assay. In the experiment of Fig. 4, GR was incubated with purified Hsp90, Hsp70, YDJ-1, and p23 without Hop (open circles)"

The transcription factor Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1 (HIF-1) was identified as an important key component of the hypoxia signaling pathway. HIF-1 is a heterodimer composed of two members of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor superfamily containing a PAS (PER-ARNT-SIM) domain: HIF-1α and HIF-1β/ARNT. During the cloning by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of the human HIF-1α subunit, we isolated two cDNA clones which corresponded to alternative splicing of the HIF-1α gene. Polymerase chain reaction analysis and sequencing revealed that both clones possessed three additional base pairs between exons 1 and 2. Also, one of them lacked 127 base pairs corresponding to exon 14. We demonstrate that the mRNA of this truncated form is expressed in several human cells lines and human skin but apparently not in rodents. When transfected in HEK 293 cells, the corresponding 736 amino acid protein (HIF-1α736) is regulated by hypoxia in a similar manner as the full-length HIF-1α (HIF-1αFL). In luciferase transfection assays, both recombinant proteins HIF-1α736 and HIF-1αFL dimerize with HIF-1β/ARNT and activate the VEGF promoter upon hypoxia. However, the shorter HIF-1α isoform is 3-fold less active than HIF-1αFL, a result consistent with the lack of the C-terminal transactivation domain. As expected, this small isoform can compete with the endogenous and transfected full-length HIF-1α. Altogether, these results suggest that the HIF-1α736isoform modulates gene expression upon hypoxia.

In the case of HIF-1α, splicing events were only described in mouse with alternative translation initiation (17.Wenger R.H. Rolfs A. Kvietikova I. Spielmann P. Zimmermann D.R. Gassmann M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and alternative splicing within exon 10 (15.Luo G. Gu Y.Z. Jain S. Chan W.K. Carr K.M. Hogenesch J.B. Bradfield C.A.

Genomics. 1998; 52: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Here, we identified for the first time two new isoforms of human HIF-1α that result from alternative splicing. The first difference with the previously cloned HIF-1α is present in the two clones at the exon 1–2 junction where three nucleotides, TAG, are added involving a difference of two amino acids upstream of the bHLH domain. The second difference concerning one clone is the lack of exon 14, which gives a shorter form of HIF-1α. In this report, we analyzed the properties of this last isoform compared with HIF-1α. HeLa, HepG2, and HEK 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 7.5% (except HeLa, 5%) inactivated fetal calf serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml) (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a CO2 incubator (5% CO2) at 37 °C. The established Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cell line CCL39 was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 7.5% fetal calf serum. Hypoxic conditions were attained by incubation of the cells in a sealed “Bug-Box” anaerobic workstation (Ruskinn Technologies, Leeds, UK/Jouan, Saint Herblain, France). The oxygen in this workstation was maintained at 1–2% with the residual gas mixture being 93–94% nitrogen, 5% carbon dioxide. The hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged HIF-1α and HIF-1β were cloned by RT-PCR. Briefly, mRNA was extracted from hypoxic HEK 293 cells with the use of the mRNA Isolation Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and reverse transcribed using the Expand Reverse Transcriptase System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). HIF-1α and HIF-1β were amplified with the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using the following primers: sense, 5′-ATGGAGGGCGCCGGCGGCGAG-3′, and antisense, 5′-GTTAACTTGATCCAAAGCTCTGAG-3′ for HIF-1α; and sense, 5′-ATGGCGGCGACTACTGCCAACCCC-3′, and antisense, 5′-TTCTGAAAAGGGGGGAAAC-3′ for HIF-1β. Conditions for PCR amplification were: 35 cycles with 30 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, 2.5 min at 72 °C, and a last cycle of elongation at 72 °C for 10 min. Blunt-ended fragments were 3′ A-tailed withTaq DNA polymerase, purified, and ligated into the PCR fragment cloning vector pTag (Ingenius-R&D Systems). To construct the HA-tagged form of HIF-1α and HIF-1β, a new PCR reaction was performed using the pTag constructions as templates and the same sense (initiation codons ATG were mutated to GAG) and antisense primers (containing a SmaI and a XbaI restriction site, respectively) previously utilized. The PCR products were digested with SmaI and XbaI and subcloned into the pECE/HA expression vector (19.Ellis L. Morgan D.O. Clauser E. Edery M. Jong S.M. Wang L.H. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1986; 2: 773-784Crossref Google Scholar). Finally, the two tagged forms were subcloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). The complete sequence was verified by Eurogentec (Liège, Belgium). The luciferase reporter plasmid used in these experiments was kindly provided by Dr. Werner Risau (20.Ikeda E. Achen M.G. Breier G.

L. Counillon and V. Vouret (University of Nice), respectively) or tissues with the mRNA Isolation Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and reverse transcribed using the Expand Reverse Transcriptase System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 3′-end of HIF-1α was amplified with the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using the primers: sense, 5′-GTCGGACAGCCTCACCAAACAGAGC-3′, and antisense, 5′-GTTAACTTGATCCAAAGCTCTGAG-3′. Total RNA of human skin fibroblasts was kindly provided by Dr. M. P. Simon (University of Nice). PCR fragments were analyzed on 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. The relative expression of the HIF-1α isoforms containing the additional TAG base pairs was determined by RT-PCR on several mRNA using the following primers: sense, 5′-13GGCGGCGCGAACGACAAGAAA33-3′, and antisense, 5′-134GGCAACTGATGAGCAAGCTCATAA111-3′. PCR products were run on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and revealed under UV light. Subconfluent HEK 293 cells on 100-mm culture dishes were transfected with 10 μg of either pcDNA3, HIF-1α736, or HIF-1α827 by the calcium phosphate method. 48 h post-transfection, cells were incubated under normoxia (20% O2) or hypoxia (1% O2) for 4 h and then lysed in lysis buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Protein concentration was determined with the BCA assay (Pierce). 800 μg of protein was immunoprecipitated with mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (from BabCO, Richmond, CA) for 1 h at 4 °C and used for Western blot analysis. Crude nuclear purification was performed as follows. After washing, cells were scrapped in cold phosphate-buffered saline with protease inhibitors (5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and then lysed with HNB buffer (0.5 m sucrose, 15 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 60 mm KCl, 0.25 mm EDTA, 0.125 mmEGTA, 0.5 mm Spermidin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors, and 0.4% Nonidet P-40). Nuclei were washed twice with the same buffer without Nonidet P-40, and Laemmli buffer was added prior to electrophoresis. Total cellular extracts (50 μg), nuclear extracts (50 μg), or immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved in SDS-polyacrylamide (7.5%) gels, transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore) and incubated with the specific antibodies: mouse anti-HIF-1α NB100–105 antibody against amino acids 432–528 of HIF-1α (Novus Biologicals, Inc., Littleton, CO) or rabbit anti-HIF-1α antiserum 2087 (22.Richard D.E. Berra E. Gothié E. Roux D. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32631-32637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar) against the last 20 amino acids of the C-terminal end of human HIF-1α. Horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibody were from Promega. The bands were visualized with the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HEK 293 cells in 12-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well) were transiently transfected by CaPO4 precipitation. Generally, 200 ng/well of reporter plasmid were used along with the indicated concentrations of expression vector, 100 ng/well cytomegalovirus β-galactosidase as a control for transfection efficiency and the empty vector, pcDNA3, to normalize the total DNA amount (2 μg/well). Cells were stimulated for 20 h and washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and luciferase assays were performed as described previously (22.Richard D.E. Berra E. Gothié E. Roux D. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32631-32637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Results were quantified with a MicroBeta TRILUX luminescence counter (Wallac) and expressed as the -fold induction over control cells. Control cells were only transfected with the cytomegalovirus β-galactosidase and the reporter plasmid. Each condition was performed in triplicate and data represent mean ± S.E. values. Fig. 4, A andB, are representative of at least two experiments. For the experiment with quantification of HIF-1α expression, 6-well plates (5 × 105 cells/well) were used, and 1 well served for the Western blot analysis. Lysis and immunoblot analysis were performed as described above except that 35 μg of total cellular extracts was used. During the cloning of HIF-1α from HEK 293 cells by RT-PCR, we isolated two cDNA clones (named H9 and H11, Fig.1 A). Restriction analysis and sequencing revealed that H11 was similar to the previously cloned HIF-1α (2.Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5059) Google Scholar) except the addition of three base pairs (TAG) 32 nucleotides downstream the initiation ATG codon. Clone H9contained the additional TAG but also lacked 127 bp at the 3′-end as compared with the wild type HIF-1α. The analysis of the humanHIF-1α gene structure (Fig. 1 B, from Iyeret al. (18.Iyer N.V. Leung S.W. Semenza G.L. Genomics. 1998; 52: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar)) showed that the three base pairs, TAG, are located at the exon 1 and 2 junction, and the 127-bp lacking fragment corresponded to exon 14. It was therefore highly possible that these differences corresponded to alternative splicing. The relative expression of the different isoforms of HIF-1α was analyzed by RT-PCR in different cell lines using primers flanking the spliced regions. Two PCR fragments corresponding to the expected length of the isoforms with (125 bp) or without (122 bp) TAG adjunction were obtained. Results shown in Fig. 2 A demonstrated that there are some differences in the level of expression of the two isoforms depending on the cell lines. In HEK 293, HepG2, and human skin fibroblasts, the major HIF-1α isoform does not contain the additional TAG. However in CCL39 cells, the major HIF-1α form appears to contain the TAG addition. In HeLa cells, both isoforms are present at similar levels. Expression of HIF-1α isoform lacking the exon 14 was also analyzed by RT-PCR using the appropriate primers (see “Materials and Methods” and Fig. 2 B). Two PCR products corresponding to the expected length with the exon (487 bp) and without (350 bp) were obtained in several human cell lines (HEK 293, Huvec, HeLa, HepG2), in human skin fibroblasts but not in Chinese Hamster lung fibroblast (CCL39), primary cultures of rabbit kidney cells, or different mouse tissues, where only the full-length isoform was detected. The specificity of the amplified fragments was verified by Southern blot analysis (data not shown) with a full-length HIF-1α as a probe. The two fragments which corresponded to the short and the long HIF-1α isoforms in HEK 293 sample were then cloned into the pTag vector and partially sequenced. We thus corroborated that the 127-bp lacking fragment corresponds to exon 14. The approximate ratio between the two isoforms was estimated by successive dilution of the RT-PCR product (Fig. 2 C). In HEK 293 cells, the shortest form of HIF-1α (lacking the exon 14) was expressed 10-fold less than the full-length HIF-1α. The addition of TAG nucleotides changes the coding sequence and modifies the Lys12 by Asn12 and adds an Arg13 (Fig. 3 A). The expected protein contains 827 amino acids compared with the 826 amino acids for the previously cloned form. The construct derived from H11 clone containing the TAG modification was thus named HIF-1α827. It is clear that in cells expressing the two forms of HIF-1α, with or without TAG, analysis by Western blot does not allow discrimination of the two isoforms, and the signal would thus correspond to a mixture of both. We thus decided to gather these isoforms under the term of HIF-1α full-length (HIF-1αFL). The lack of exon 14 produces a frameshift and introduces a stop codon in the coding sequence after an Ile735 (Fig.3 A). The expected protein contains 735 amino acids compared with the 826 amino acids for the wild-type form. The construct derived from H9 clone, referred to here as HIF-1α736(according to the two modifications presented), conserves all the structure except the removal of the C terminusTransactivation Domain (TAD) and a part of theInhibitory Domain (ID). To study the migration pattern of the two isoforms, we first compared the in vitro translated proteins (Fig. 3 B). As expected, HIF-1α736 migrates at a lower molecular weight than HIF-1α827. When both isoforms were transfected in HEK 293 cells, immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody, and resolved on SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 3 C, lanes 8, 9, 18, and 19), they both migrated as a doublet. Recently, results from our laboratory have clearly demonstrated that this doublet is due at least in part to phosphorylation by p42/p44 MAPK (22.Richard D.E. Berra E. Gothié E. Roux D. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32631-32637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). HIF-1α827 shows a molecular mass of around 104–116 kDa, similar to the expression profile of wild type HIF-1α), while HIF-1α736 migrates at 94–103 kDa. Finally, we wanted to evaluate the expression of the endogenous exon 14 spliced variant protein in human cells. Thus, nuclear extracts from HeLa and HEK 293 were immunoblotted with two different antibodies: NB100–105 (Fig. 3 C, lanes 11–19) and HIF-1α 2087 (Fig. 3 C, lanes 1–9), directed against the central region and the C-terminal end of HIF-1α, respectively. Immunoprecipitated proteins from transfected HEK 293 cells were used as positive control. In contrast, nuclear extracts from CCL39 cells in which the truncated form has not been detected by RT-PCR were used as negative control. Results from Fig. 3 C show that NB100–105 antibody specifically recognizes a band in extracts from HeLa cells upon hypoxia at the expected size (see Fig. 3 C, lanes 4 and 14). The existence of another form of HIF-1α raises the question of the functionality of these proteins. We first investigated the effect of the isoform resulting from exon 14 splicing (HIF-1α736) on the transcription of VEGF gene. To be sure that the effects observed were because of the truncation of the C-terminal extremity and not to the modifications resulting from the addition of the TAG to the exon 1–2 junction, we transfected the HIF-1α827 form as a full-length HIF-1α isoform. Studies concerning the specific modification because of TAG addition are currently under investigation. HEK 293 cells were co-transfected with the VEGF promoter coupled to the luciferase reporter gene (20.Ikeda E. Achen M.G. Breier G. Risau W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19761-19766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 21.Milanini J. Vinals F. Pouysségur J. Pagès G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18165-18172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) and expression plasmids for HIF-1β, and HIF-1α736, or HIF-1α827. As shown in Fig. 4 A, both recombinant proteins, HIF-1α736 and HIF-1α827, dimerize with HIF-1β, induce the VEGF promoter in a dose-dependant manner, and are activated by hypoxia. However, the level of their response differs and the shorter HIF-1α isoform is 3-fold less potent than HIF-1αFL. The specific activities of both isoforms were assessed by monitoring the protein expression level using two antibodies (NB 100–105 and HIF-1α 2087) which, respectively, recognize either the two forms of HIF-1α or only the full-length HIF-1α (Fig. 4 B). Upon hypoxia, the expression level of the two proteins is similar but in normoxia HIF-1α736 is more strongly expressed. As both isoforms are expressed to a similar level upon hypoxia, we can conclude that HIF-1α736 is 3- to 4-fold less active than HIF-1α827, a result consistent with the truncation of the C-terminal transactivation domain. According to experiments in which only empty vector was transfected, hypoxia is able to stimulate endogenous HIF-1 complex and induce the VEGF promoter activity. In the absence of transfected HIF-1β, recombinant HIF-1α827 increases this endogenous response upon hypoxia in HEK 293 cells, whereas HIF-1α736decreases it (Fig. 5 A). These results suggested that the spliced variant of HIF-1α (HIF-1α736) can compete with the endogenous HIF-1α for HIF-1β on the VEGF promoter. To confirm these results, we tested the competition by HIF-1α736 on HIF-1α827-dependent transactivation in cells co-transfected with HIF-1β and the two isoforms of HIF-1α (Fig.5 B). We used 100 ng of HIF-1α827 to be consistent with the results presented on Fig. 4 A. Indeed, at this concentration, inducibility (ratio hypoxia/normoxia) begins to decrease, a sign of a saturation of the system. The hypoxic response obtained with these amounts of HIF-1α827 is arbitrarily fixed to 100%. The maximal response obtained with the short form transfected alone and expressed as a percentage of this response is 49.6% (Fig. 5 B). The co-transfection of HIF-1α736 and HIF-1α827 inhibits the response of HIF-1α827 alone. Taken together these results demonstrate that HIF-1α736 can compete in vivo with the full-length HIF-1α for the induction of the VEGF promoter. In this report, we have cloned two new isoforms of HIF-1α that result from alternative splicing. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing an alternative spliced variant of human HIF-1α. Two differences with the previously cloned HIF-1α were described: 1) an additional 3 bp at the exon 1–2 junction involving a difference of two amino acids upstream of the bHLH domain (HIF-1α827), and 2) the lack of exon 14 introducing a frameshift resulting in a shorter form of HIF-1α (HIF-1α736). The level of expression of this newly identified isoform is smaller compared with the full-length HIF-1α. The isoform presenting an additional TAG between exon 1 and 2 has already been described by Drutel (23.Drutel, G., Discovery, Localization, and Functions of ARNT2, a New 6HLH/PAS Transcription Factor. Ph.D. thesis, 1998; Université Paris 6Google Scholar). He detected this splice variant in several regions of the rat brain and in PC12 cells. Here, we show that these isoforms are expressed in several human cell lines, in human skin fibroblasts, and in the CCL39 Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cell line. Our results demonstrate that they are present in several species and are expressed with different ratios depending on the origin of the cell line. The exact implication of this HIF-1α splice variant in hypoxia signaling remains to be determined. In contrast, the isoform lacking exon 14 (HIF-1α736) appears to be present only in human cells. We estimate that HIF-1α736 is expressed 10-fold less than the full-length at the mRNA levels. We suggest also that the protein ratio HIF-1αFL/HIF-1α736 is similar and reflects the relative mRNA levels. In this context, it is important to note that the presence of overlapping bands between the two HIF-1α isoforms, as a consequence of the different phosphorylation states, hinders us in demonstrating the presence of endogenous HIF-1α736 protein by Western blot analysis. The design of an antibody which only recognizes the short form should be the ideal. However, this is virtually impossible because the only difference between the two forms resides in the presence of one isoleucin at the C-terminal end of HIF-1α736. TADs are present within the C-terminal portion of HIF-1α (24.Jiang B.H. Zheng J.Z. Leung S.W. Roe R. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19253-19260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 25.Pugh C.W. O'Rourke J.F. Nagao M. Gleadle J.M. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11205-11214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Each TAD could act independently and could be regulated during hypoxia by different mechanisms. Indeed, Jiang et al. (24.Jiang B.H. Zheng J.Z. Leung S.W. Roe R. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19253-19260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) reported that the N-terminal TAD (N-TAD), when fused to a GAL4 DNA binding domain, is still inducible upon hypoxia, whereas the inducible response of the C-terminal TAD (C-TAD) is because of repression of its constitutive transcriptional activity under normoxic conditions by the inhibitory domain. Henceforth, it is accepted that the inducible activity of N-TAD is mainly a consequence of HIF-1α induction because this domain is co-localized with theOxygen-dependent DegradationDomain (ODD) (26.Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar) which is responsible for HIF-1α instability. The HIF-1α736 isoform highlighted in this article is interesting because it only possesses the N-terminal transactivation domain and can support in vivo the results with fusion proteins, on the activity of N-TAD independently of C-TAD. It is important to note that the NLS responsible for hypoxia-inducible import RKRK (27.Kallio P.J. Okamoto K. O'Brien S. Carrero P. Makino Y. Tanaka H. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6573-6586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is also present on the shorter form and allowed us to anticipate that this isoform was functional. Indeed, our results show that the HIF-1α736 isoform is also regulated during hypoxia and is able to transactivate the VEGF promoter with HIF-1β, even if it lacks the C terminus TAD. We thus demonstrate by this experiment that N-TAD is active without C-TAD in vivo. As expected, our experiments also show that in this context the specific activity of the short form is less important than full-length HIF-1α. However, the short form could have some different properties on other promoters. The results of Tian, H. et al. (3.Tian H. McKnight S.L. Russell D.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar) showing that EPAS-1/HIF-2α, is able to specifically activate Tie-2reporter gene whereas HIF-1α does not are in favor of a putative specific role of HIF-1α736. Moreover, two other ARNT isoforms have been described, ARNT2 and ARNT3. Consequently, the short form in association with one of these partners could regulate specific target promoters. The expression profiles of recombinant isoforms suggest that, in normoxia, HIF-1α736 is expressed at levels higher than those of HIF-1αFL (see Fig. 4 B). The putative presence of HIF-1α736 in normoxia could be important under certain physiological conditions or tissues where the wild type protein is totally absent because of protein degradation (26.Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar, 28.Salceda S. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22642-22647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1411) Google Scholar). More experiments are required to verify this hypothesis. It will be interesting also to determine upon which physiological conditions exon 14 is alternatively spliced in order to study whether the short form could modulate the HIF-1α-dependent responses. CBP/P300, which was found to mediate transcriptional activation by HIF-1α (29.Arany Z. Huang L.E. Eckner R. Bhattacharya S. Jiang C. Goldberg M.A. Bunn H.F. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12969-12973Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar) and HIF-2α (30.Ema M. Hirota K. Mimura J. Abe H. Yodoi J. Sogawa K. Poellinger L. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1905-1914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), interacts with the two TADs and enhances the hypoxia-inducible transactivation. However, Ema et al. (30.Ema M. Hirota K. Mimura J. Abe H. Yodoi J. Sogawa K. Poellinger L. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1905-1914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), demonstrate that CBP/P300 directly interacts with C-TAD in a yeast two-hybrid system and is the potential cofactor responsible for the inducible response of the C-TAD, whereas interaction with N-TAD is indirect. We are currently evaluating the effect of p300 on the two isoforms of HIF-1α and determine whether p300 has a differential action on them. This would enable us to validate the in vivoaction of p300 on the two TADs. In summary, we have described for the first time alternative splicing for the human HIF-1α gene. The resulting isoforms are inducible upon hypoxia and transactivate VEGF promoter. The HIF-1α736 also competes with full-length HIF-1α for recruitment of HIF-1β. One of the crucial questions now is to determine the conditions which regulates this alternative splicing to evaluate the exact role of these proteins during hypoxic stress. We thank Dr. W. Risau and J. Milanini for the VEGF promoter constructs and D. Grall and Y. Fantei for their excellent technical assistance."

The ability to hydrolyze phosphotyrosine and phosphothreonine/serine residues efficiently and the lack of sequence homology outside the conserved active-site motif HCXXGXXRS(T) distinguish the DSPs from the protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). Several DSPs act as central regulators of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases (1.Keyse S.M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). MAP kinases play a central role in mediating intracellular signaling events triggered by mitogens, growth factors, and stress (2.Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin.

The MAP kinases are activated by specific upstream dual specificity kinases (MAP kinase kinases, MKKs) through phosphorylation on both threonine and tyrosine residues in the TXY motif. Extracellular stimuli activate MAP kinases leading to the phosphorylation of an array of cellular substrates and nuclear transcription factors. In mammals, three distinct MAP kinase families have been studied extensively. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) family is activated by growth and differentiation factors and by phorbol esters (4.Hill C.S. Treisman R.

Theodosiou A. Gillieron C. Smith A. Chabert C. Camps M. Boschert U. Rodrigues N. Davies K. Ashworth A. Arkinstall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9323-9329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). This NH2-terminal domain is distinct from the common catalytic core that resides at the COOH-terminal half of the protein. Not only does the NH2-terminal domain bind ERK protein independently, but in the context of the full-length protein, ERK binding activates the phosphatase activity by at least 35-fold (14.Camps M. Nichols A. Gillieron C. Antonsson B. Muda M. Chabert C. Boschert U. Arkinstall S. Science. 1998; 280: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). ERK phosphorylation was not required for either binding or activation. The physical basis for this dramatic activation has not been established.Recently, the x-ray structure for the catalytic domain of Pyst1 was solved. The overall structure was remarkably similar to the previously published x-ray structure of the DSP VHR (15.Yuvaniyama J. Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Saper M.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1328-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and that predicted from modeling studies based on the VHR structure (16.Wiland A.M. Denu J.M. Mourey R.J.

Saper M.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1328-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) represents the minimal catalytic domain shared with larger DSPs such as MKP3, MKP1, PAC1, which share 30% sequence identity to VHR within the catalytic domain but contain a second domain that is predicted to extend from the amino terminus. VHR has served as the archetypal DSP in detailed biochemical and structural studies (15.Yuvaniyama J. Denu J.M. Dixon J.E.

Stuckey J.A. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Cell. 1996; 87: 361-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), and the deduced catalytic mechanism has served as a model for all DSPs. The thiolate of cysteine 124 in the signature motif HCXXGXXRS(T) is the nucleophile that attacks the phosphorus of substrate, transferring the phosphate group to the enzyme, forming a cysteinyl-phosphate enzyme intermediate. Catalysis is enhanced by conserved aspartic acid 92, which is positioned to act as a general acid by protonating the leaving group oxygen. Aspartic acid 92 is found on a separate loop structure that was shown to be flexible in several PTPs. In these PTPs, ligand binding induces the movement of the “general acid loop” toward the active site such that the conserved aspartic acid is in position to transfer a proton to the leaving group. In the recent Pyst1 structure, the proposed general acid loop was flipped 20 Å away from the active-site cleft. In this conformation, the proposed general acid (Asp-262) would not be expected to contribute to catalysis. Consistent with this idea, mutation of Asp to Asn (D262N) resulted in an enzyme that displayed activity similar to that of the wild type enzyme (22.Stewart A.E. Dowd S. Keyse S.M. McDonald N.Q. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). More interestingly, the D262N mutant could no longer be activated by ERK protein. Collectively, these data suggested that ERK binding to MKP3/Pyst1/rVH6 induces general acid loop closure and the subsequent involvement of Asp-262 acting as the general acid catalyst.To elucidate the mechanistic basis for the dramatic catalytic enhancement and provide direct evidence that ERK binding induces general acid catalysis by wild type MKP3, we have performed an extensive enzymatic comparison of the activated and unactivated form of MKP3. Using steady-state and rapid-reaction kinetics, pH studies, and Brönsted analysis, we demonstrate that ERK-activated MKP3 utilizes general acid catalysis, enhancing the rate of P-O bond cleavage by 100-fold. Also, the catalytic activation on all reaction steps is evaluated.DISCUSSIONWhen the enzymatic activity of MKP3 was first characterized (16.Wiland A.M. Denu J.M. Mourey R.J. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33486-33492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), it was quite surprising that the rates of catalysis were almost 3 orders of magnitude lower than the related DSP VHR. It was also curious that MKP3 lacked the critical ionization for a group that must be protonated for activity (Ref. 16.Wiland A.M. Denu J.M. Mourey R.J. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33486-33492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar and this paper). The pH profiles of unactivated and activated MKP3 bore a remarkable resemblance to the pH profiles of wild type VHR and the general acid mutant VHR D92N (20.Denu J.M. Zhou G. Guo Y. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3396-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), respectively, both in the magnitude of the general acid rate enhancement and the loss of this ionization in the pH profiles. The D92N mutant of VHR was ∼100-fold less active than native enzyme and exhibited the loss of the basic limb in the pH profiles. We had suggested that MKP3 was not employing general acid catalysis by the proposed general acid Asp-262 (16.Wiland A.M. Denu J.M. Mourey R.J. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33486-33492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We reasoned that Asp-262 was not positioned properly to aid in catalysis; however, why this was the case was not clear. In 1998, Camps et al. (14.Camps M. Nichols A. Gillieron C. Antonsson B. Muda M. Chabert C. Boschert U. Arkinstall S. Science. 1998; 280: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) discovered that MKP3 could be activated catalytically by binding to ERK, MKP3's proposed authentic substrate. The noncatalytic amino-terminal domain was believed to play a role in this activation because this domain could bind ERK independently and was necessary to induce the dramatic activation of MKP3. The recent x-ray structure of the catalytic domain of Pyst1 (MKP3) revealed an overall structure (22.Stewart A.E. Dowd S. Keyse S.M. McDonald N.Q. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) that was very similar to VHR (15.Yuvaniyama J. Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Saper M.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1328-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). However, the proposed general acid loop was flipped 20 Å away from the active-site cleft. In this conformation, the proposed general acid Asp-262 would not be expected to contribute to catalysis. Consistent with this idea, mutation of Asp to Asn (D262N) resulted in an enzyme that displayed activity similar to that of the wild type enzyme (22.Stewart A.E. Dowd S. Keyse S.M. McDonald N.Q. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Moreover, the D262N mutant could no longer be activated by ERK protein. Collectively, these observations suggested that ERK binding to MKP3 may induce general acid loop closure and the subsequent involvement of Asp-262 acting as general acid catalyst. The rationale for the present study was to pinpoint which steps in catalysis undergo activation and to provide evidence for direct general acid catalysis by wild type activated MKP3.We have not only provided direct evidence that ERK induces efficient general acid catalysis during phosphoenzyme intermediate formation, but we have identified and quantified the activation on all major catalytic steps in the reaction. The largest catalytic activation occurs on intermediate formation (k 3, Scheme FS1), where ERK induces 2 orders of magnitude rate enhancement. ERK also induces 5–6-fold activation on intermediate hydrolysis (k 5, Scheme FS1). The apparentK d values are 2–3-fold lower in the presence of ERK. Consistent with higher affinity for substrate, the oxyanion phosphate binds 19-fold tighter to ERK-activated MKP3 than to MKP3.The pH dependence of activated MKP3 clearly established the involvement of general acid catalysis (Fig. 1). In contrast, unactivated MKP3 did not display this ionization as critical for the low activity form of the enzyme. Instead, only slight decreases in rates were observed when Asp-262 is deprotonated. These results can be explained by a model in which ERK binding induces the movement of the general acid loop into its catalytically competent position. In the active conformation, the Asp must be protonated to act as a general acid. In its ionized form, Asp-262 is incapable of stabilizing the developing negative charge on the leaving group; and, if the negative charge on unprotonated Asp-262 is positioned at the active site, this will generate charge repulsion between the dianion of the binding substrate. Consistent with the conclusion that ERK binding correctly positions the general acid loop and Asp-262, there is a greater increase in K mvalues (with increasing pH above the pK a for Asp-262) for activated versus unactivated MKP3 (Fig. 1). In the unactivated enzyme, the loop would be predominantly flipped out of the active site, resulting in only a small relative change in activity and binding when Asp-262 becomes ionized. However, because there is a slight change in activity caused by this ionization, Asp may be partially or inefficiently contributing to binding/catalysis in the unactivated enzyme.With excellent leaving groups such as 3-o-methylfluorescein and 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferone, the rate of intermediate formation is similar between activated and unactivated MKP3 (Fig. 2). However, as the pK a increases, there is a large dependence on leaving group pK a for unactivated enzyme compared with activated enzyme (Fig. 2 a). This result was observed in both the pre-steady-state (Fig. 5) and steady-state (Fig. 2) analyses and strongly suggests that unactivated MKP3 lacks efficient general acid catalysis. In contrast, ERK-activated enzyme is able to utilize general acid catalysis, transferring a proton to the leaving group oxygen such that no significant negative charge is built up during the transition state of P-O bond cleavage. Curiously though,k cat/K m activation by ERK reaches a plateau value of ∼70-fold with increasing leaving group pK a value (Fig. 2 b). Unfortunately, the pre-steady-state analysis could not be extended to substrates whose leaving group pK a value was greater than 7.8 (Fig.5). The plateau in k cat/K mactivation would not necessarily be predicted if the unactivated enzyme were completely devoid of any general acid catalysis. One might expect that the magnitude of activation would become increasing larger as the pK a value increases. These observations suggest that the rate of loop closure in unactivated MKP3 may contribute to the observed rates of intermediate formation. The data can be explained in the following manner. With good leaving groups, unactivated MKP3 does not require general acid catalysis and thus does not require loop closure. But as the leaving group becomes poorer, proton donation becomes increasingly important for catalysis. Thek cat/K m values do not continue to drop because loop closure now limits the rate at which the proton can be donated to the leaving group.Induced loop closure is also suggested by the Me2SO activation experiments. ERK's dramatic activation of MKP3 could be mimicked by the addition of 25% Me2SO (Fig. 6). The aprotic organic solvent Me2SO has been shown previously to behave as a chemical chaperone, stabilizing the cellular prion protein (30.Tatzelt J. Prusiner S.B. Welch W.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6363-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) and the E2 conformation of the H+-ATPase (31.Ferreira-Pereira A. Alves-Ferreira M. de Carvalho-Alves P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12074-12079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and favoring a conformation in F1-ATPase which demonstrates slower catalysis and low affinity ATP binding (32.al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We surmised that if ERK could stabilize the active closed conformation of MKP3, then perhaps a solvent like Me2SO could also function as a stabilizing agent. Although Me2SO was functionally similar to ERK, the physical mechanism by which ERK activates the phosphatase is likely to be mediated through the specific binding to the noncatalytic NH2-terminal domain of MKP3. This domain has been shown to exhibit high affinity binding to ERK (13.Muda M. Theodosiou A. Gillieron C. Smith A. Chabert C. Camps M. Boschert U. Rodrigues N. Davies K. Ashworth A. Arkinstall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9323-9329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain alone exhibits only small activation in the presence of ERK (14.Camps M. Nichols A. Gillieron C. Antonsson B. Muda M. Chabert C. Boschert U. Arkinstall S. Science. 1998; 280: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 22.Stewart A.E. Dowd S. Keyse S.M. McDonald N.Q. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the NH2 terminus of MKP3 and other MKPs share significant sequence homology to regions found in the catalytic domain of the p80 cdc25 phosphatase (33.Kwak S.P. Hakes D.J. Martell K.J. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3596-3604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent x-ray analysis of the catalytic domain of p80 cdc25 revealed that these homologous regions are required to form the core domain (34.Fauman E.B. Cogswell J.P. Lovejoy B. Rocque W.J. Holmes W. Montana V.G. Piwnica-Worms H. Rink M.J. Saper M.A. Cell. 1998; 93: 617-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) and are proposed to interact with the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK2, the in vivo substrate of p80 cdc25.The observed activation on both ligand binding and phosphoenzyme intermediate hydrolysis provides further evidence for ERK-induced general acid loop closure. In addition to direct general acid catalysis, the general acid loop appears to play several catalytic roles. One major role is to position the catalytic arginine. In the enzyme-substrate complex, negative charge on equatorial oxygens of the substrate phosphate are stabilized by a bidentate interaction with the conserved arginine and by the backbone amide N-H groups of the conserved active-site motif HCXXGXXRT(S) (SchemeFS2). In the x-ray structure of VHR, the carbonyl oxygen of Ala-90 is hydrogen-bonded to one of the guanidinium nitrogens of Arg-130 (Scheme FS2). Interestingly, this interaction involving the carbonyl oxygen (two residues NH2-terminal of the general acid Asp) can be observed in other PTP structures where the general acid loop is in the closed conformation (15.Yuvaniyama J. Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Saper M.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1328-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 28.Denu J.M. Lohse D.L. Vijayalakshmi J. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2493-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 35.Stuckey J.A. Schubert H.L. Fauman E.B. Zhang Z.Y. Dixon J.E. Saper M.A. Nature. 1994; 370: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 36.Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). This interaction helps to position the Arg for its function in phosphate binding and transition-state stabilization. The Pyst1 catalytic domain structure revealed a severely open general acid loop conformation, and the corresponding Arg-299 is positioned incorrectly to bind the oxyanion of substrate efficiently (22.Stewart A.E. Dowd S. Keyse S.M. McDonald N.Q. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Although there is no structure available for the closed conformation of Pyst1, we would predict that the carbonyl of Ile-262 will interact with and position Arg-299, creating an efficient pocket for phosphate binding. Consistent with the idea of the general acid loop positioning Arg-299, activated MKP3 displays higher affinities for oxyanions such as phosphate as well as for substrates.We have demonstrated previously that the conserved Asp of VHR and PTP1 plays a role during intermediate hydrolysis (28.Denu J.M. Lohse D.L. Vijayalakshmi J. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2493-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The Asp may function as a general base during intermediate hydrolysis, activating a water molecule to facilitate nucleophilic attack. Consistent with this mechanism and the involvement of Asp-262, intermediate hydrolysis is 5–6-fold faster for ERK-activated MKP3 (Tables II and III). Because the rate enhancement is significantly smaller than that observed for intermediate formation, this may indicate that the general acid loop is better able to adopt a closed conformation in the phosphoenzyme intermediate.We provide detailed biochemical evidence that ERK activates MKP3 through the stabilization of the active phosphatase conformation, where the general acid loop efficiently participates in general acid/base catalysis, substrate binding, and transition-state stabilization. ERK binding acts as a switch in converting the low activity form to the activated form of MKP3. Regulation of PTPs through the utilization of this flexible general acid loop may be a general mechanism. Two inhibitory mechanisms have been proposed from observations of the crystal structures of SHP-2 (an SH2-domain PTP) (37.Hof P. Pluskey S. Dhe-Paganon S. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 441-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar) and RPTPα (a receptor-like PTP) (38.Bilwes A.M. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). With SHP-2, an intramolecular interaction with its SH2 domain sterically blocks and inhibits the active site in the unliganded form. For RPTPα, an inhibitory dimer is thought to form upon binding extracellular ligand. The structure revealed that the amino-terminal helix-turn-helix of one monomer is wedged into the active site of the dyad-related monomer. In both cases, these interactions lock the PTP domain into the open conformation by preventing closure of the general acid loop. The dual specificity phosphatases (DSPs)1 have emerged as important regulators of cell cycle control and mitogenic signal transduction. The ability to hydrolyze phosphotyrosine and phosphothreonine/serine residues efficiently and the lack of sequence homology outside the conserved active-site motif HCXXGXXRS(T) distinguish the DSPs from the protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). Several DSPs act as central regulators of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases (1.Keyse S.M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). MAP kinases play a central role in mediating intracellular signaling events triggered by mitogens, growth factors, and stress (2.Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2273) Google Scholar, 3.Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). The MAP kinases are activated by specific upstream dual specificity kinases (MAP kinase kinases, MKKs) through phosphorylation on both threonine and tyrosine residues in the TXY motif. Extracellular stimuli activate MAP kinases leading to the phosphorylation of an array of cellular substrates and nuclear transcription factors. In mammals, three distinct MAP kinase families have been studied extensively. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) family is activated by growth and differentiation factors and by phorbol esters (4.Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). The c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) family (or stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) and p38 MAP kinase family are activated by proinflamatory cytokines and environmental stress. Specific DS-PTPs have been shown to dephosphorylate both Thr and Tyr in the TXY motif of MAP kinases (5.Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K.

Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 410-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) provided fundamental paradigms for the assembly of the cell death machinery and helped identify critical molecular targets of apoptosis effector proteins (4.Raff M. Nature. 1998; 396: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). In addition to the Bcl-2 family of cell death regulators (5.Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4811) Google Scholar), the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP)1gene family has recently attracted attention for its broad distribution and evolutionary conservation (6.Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar, 7.LaCasse E.C. Baird S. Korneluk R.G. MacKenzie A.E. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3247-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Originally found in the baculovirus as factors that prevent the suicide of virally infected host cells (8.Clem R.J. Miller L.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5212-5222Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), homologous IAP proteins have since been identified in yeast, worms, flies, and mammalian cells (6.Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar, 7.LaCasse E.C. Baird S. Korneluk R.G. MacKenzie A.E. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3247-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Each molecule contains one to three copies of an 80-amino acid baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR), which are potentially involved in Zn2+ ion coordination via a DX 3CX 2C/HX 6C consensus (9.Hinds M.G. Norton R.S. Vaux D.L. Day C.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 648-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In addition, BIR proteins often contain a C3HC4 RING finger (6.Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar, 7.LaCasse E.C. Baird S. Korneluk R.G. MacKenzie A.E. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3247-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Functionally, aDrosophila IAP protein, DIAP, has been shown to counteract apoptosis induced by the death genes, reaper,hid, and grim (10.Vucic D. Kaiser W.J. Miller L.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3300-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In contrast, mammalian IAP proteins (XIAP, NAIP, c-IAP1, c-IAP2, and survivin) block apoptosis by inactivating terminal effector caspase-3 and -7 and by interfering with upstream activation of caspase-9 (6.Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar, 7.LaCasse E.C. Baird S. Korneluk R.G. MacKenzie A.E. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3247-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). This suggested that, although IAP proteins are evolutionarily conserved apoptosis inhibitors, they may have distinct mechanisms in different organisms. Recent evidence suggested that certain IAP proteins might participate in cellular functions other than apoptosis and, in particular, cell division. Specifically, survivin, the smallest mammalian IAP protein with a single BIR domain and no RING finger (11.Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D.C. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (3016) Google Scholar), was found to be expressed in mitosis in a strict cell cycle-regulated manner (12.Li F. Ambrosini G. Chu E.Y. Plescia J. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C. Nature. 1998; 396: 580-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). Starting at early prophase, survivin was localized to mitotic spindle microtubules persisting until late telophase in midbodies (12.Li F. Ambrosini G. Chu E.Y. Plescia J. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C. Nature. 1998; 396: 580-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). Moreover, RNA interference of a single BIR-containing IAP gene,BIR-1, in C. elegans did not result in dysregulated apoptosis but caused an embryonic lethal defect of cytokinesis with multinucleation (13.Fraser A.G. James C. Evan G.I. Hengartner M.O. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 292-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, a single BIR gene is also present in yeast S. cerevisiae (6.Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar, 7.LaCasse E.C. Baird S. Korneluk R.G. MacKenzie A.E. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3247-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar), which lacks caspases and is not believed to possess an apoptosis program (14.Fraser A. James C. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 219-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To determine the function of prototypic, single BIR-containing IAP proteins in vivo, we disrupted the BIR1 gene in yeast S. cerevisiae. This action produced a lethal phenotype, indicating that BIR1 is an essential gene. Moreover, analysis of heterozygous diploid mutants revealed a pleiotropic cell division defect, which affected ploidy, cell growth, and cell morphology, revealing a role of IAP proteins in cell division control. Standard methods for the growth and maintenance of the yeast and bacteria were used throughout (15.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). S. cerevisiae strain YPH501 (MAT a/MATα ura3–52/ura3–52 lys2–801;am/lys2–801;am ade2–101;oc/ade2–101;oc trp1-Δ63/trp1-Δ63 his3-Δ200/his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1/leu2-Δ1) (16.Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used for the characterization of BIR1. Yeast cells were maintained in rich (YP) medium or synthetic (SC) medium lacking appropriate nutrients to maintain plasmid selection and were supplemented with either 2% dextrose (YPD, SCD) or 2% galactose and 0.2% sucrose (YPG, SCG). Cells were grown at 30 °C unless otherwise indicated. To construct the bir1::URA3 mutant, the “left” and “right” portions of the bir1 gene (lacking a 2938-base pair segment of the coding region) were PCR-amplified using the primer pairs of yBIR1-P1 (5′-TGC TCT AGA TTG GTT TGT TTC TTG CTA CG-3′) and yBIR1-P2 (5′-GGA AGA TCT ATA AAC AAC CGA TGT GTC C-3′) or yBIR1-P3 (5′-GGA AGA TCT GAA TGT TTC GCC GCA TCG CAG-3′) and yBIR1-P4 (5′-GAC GCG TCG ACC AAG ATT ATG TCG TAG CAC C-3′). The amplification products were digested withXbaI-BglII or BglII-SalI and subcloned into the XbaI-SalI sites of pBluescript KS, yielding pBluescript KS-BIR1-LR. The URA3gene was subcloned as a 3.8-kilobase pairBglII-BamHI fragment (from plasmid pNKY51) into the BglII site of pBluescript KS-BIR1-LR, yielding thebir1::URA3 plasmid, pBluescript KS-BIR1-LR-URA3. YPH501 cells were transformed using the LiAc TRAFO method, as described previously (17.Agatep, R., Kirkpatrick, R. D., Parchaliuk, D. L., Woods, R. A., and Gietz, R. D. (1998) Technical Tips Online, http://tto.trends.comGoogle Scholar). To confirm each gene disruption, genomic DNA was prepared (15.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar) and PCR-amplified using primers flanking yBIR-P0 (5′-CTG CTT CAA ATG CAT GTC), as well as internal to the disrupting auxotrophic marker. Disruptions were further confirmed using a set of primers internal to the BIR1 gene, yBIR1–5′ (5′-TCC CCC GGG ATA ATG GAT GGT CAA ATA GAT AAA ATG G-3′) and yBIR1–3′ (5′-ACG CGT CGA CCT GCG ATG CGG CGA AAC ATT C-3′). For tetrad dissection, diploids were grown overnight at 24 °C in pre-sporulation medium (1% potassium acetate, 0.1% yeast extract, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate, supplemented with amino acids and uracil) and then washed and transferred to SPM sporulation medium (1% potassium acetate) for an additional 3–5 days. Dissections were carried out as described (15.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). For expression of wild-typeBIR1, the gene was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA using the primer pair yBIR1-P1 (5′-TGC TCT AGA TTG GTT TGT TTC TTG CTA CG-3′) and yBIR1-P4 (5′-GAC GCG TCG ACC AAG ATT ATG TCG TAG CAC C-3′). The 4930-kilobase pair PCR product was digested withXbaI-SalI and subcloned into the corresponding sites of pRS315. For overexpression of BIR1, the full-length open reading frame was amplified using yBIR1–5′ and yBIR1–3′ (described above). The amplified product was digested withSmaI-SalI and subcloned into the corresponding sites of pRS315-ADH, a yeast expression vector containing the promoter and terminator from ADH1 (18.Song J. Hirschman J. Gunn K. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20273-20283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Similar plasmids containing the Bir1 N-terminal domain (containing two BIR repeats, residues 1–251) or the C-terminal domain (residues 252–954) were constructed by PCR, as described above, using internal primers yBIR1N-3′ (5′-ACG CGT CGA CCT ATG TCT GAA AGA AAT AAC AGT TCC C-3′) or yBIR1C-5′ (5′-TCC CCC GGG ATA ATG CAG ACA CGT AAT CGA TTT GAG AG-3′). For expression of wild-type survivin, the cDNA was PCR-amplified using the primer pair of HS-Y5′ (5′-CGG GAT CCA GAA TGG GTG CCC CGA CGT TGC-′) and HS-Y3′ (5′-GG AAT TCT CAA TCC ATG GCA GCC AG-′). The 450-base pair products were digested withBamHI-coRI and subcloned into the corresponding sites of pRS316-ADH to yield pRS316-ADH-survivin. Similar plasmids containing either the N-terminal (residues 1–96, N-survivin) and C-terminal (65 residues 97–142, C-survivin) domains of survivin were constructed by PCR as described above, using internal primers HS-N3′ (5′-GG AAT TCT CAA GAA AGG AAA GCG CAA CCG GA-′) and HS-C5′ (5′-GG GAT CCA CAA TGC TTT CTG TCA AGA AGC AG-′). For galactose-inducible expression, the ADH1 promoter was removed (KpnI,SmaI fragment) and replaced with the GAL1/10promoter (KpnI, blunt-ended XbaI) from pRS315-GAL, to yield pRS316-GAL-survivin. Alternatively, the coding region and ADH1 terminator were moved as aBamHI-BglII fragment to the BamHI site of pRS315-GAL to yield pRS315-GAL-survivin (including N-survivin and C-survivin). To substitute the URA3 nutritional marker with the LEU2, URA3-containingPvuI-PvuI fragment of pRS316-based vectors was replaced with the corresponding LEU2-containing fragment of pRS315 to yield pRS315-ADH-survivin and pRS315-GAL-survivin. All PCR products were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cultures for FACS analysis were grown to saturation and then diluted toA 600 nm ∼ 0.2 in the same medium and grown toA 600 nm ∼ 1.0. 1.5 ml of the culture was sonicated for 10 s, centrifuged for 10 s at maximum speed in a tabletop microfuge, resuspended in 2 ml of 70% EtOH, and incubated overnight at 23 °C with gentle shaking. Cells were then centrifuged, washed twice with 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, resuspended in 0.8 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and 200 μg of heat-inactivated RNase A, and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Cells were centrifuged, resuspended in 0.5 ml of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 2.5 mg pepsin, and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were centrifuged, washed once with 1 ml of 200 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 211 mm NaCl, 78 mmMgCl2, and resuspended in 0.55 ml of the same buffer containing 50 μg of propidium iodide. Flow cytometric analysis was performed with a FACS Vantage flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). The cells were excited at 488 nm, and the emission was collected through a 630/22 nm band pass filter. A minimum of 10,000 cells was analyzed for each sample. Cell cycle analysis was performed using the Modfit 5.2 model (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME). For light microscopic examination, cells were grown to mid-log phase, fixed in growth medium with formaldehyde (3.7% final concentration), and photographed with Kodak TMax 100 film using a Zeiss Axioscop and MC80 camera at 400× magnification with DIC optics. Cell growth was monitored by diluting a saturated overnight culture to A 600 nm ∼ 0.2 and measuring the change in absorbance over time. Cell viability was determined by serially diluting cultures grown to saturation, spotting onto the appropriate medium, and incubating for 48 h at 24, 30, 34, or 37 °C in the presence or absence of 1 msorbitol. The sequencing of the S. cerevisiae genome (19.Goffeau A. Barrell B.G. Bussey H. Davis R.W. Dujon B. Feldmann H. Galibert F. Hoheisel J.D. Jacq C. Johnston M. Louis E.J. Mewes H.W. Murakami Y. Philippsen P. Tettelin H. Oliver S.G. Science. 1996; 274 (563–567): 546Crossref PubMed Scopus (3251) Google Scholar) has revealed a single open reading frame with homology to IAP family proteins. This gene, designated BIR1 (SCYJR089w), encodes a protein of 954 amino acids and features two BIR domains at residues 12–116 and 145–240. Phylogenetic analysis (20.Uren A.G. Coulson E.J. Vaux D.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 159-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) revealed the greatest similarity to Schizosaccharomyces pombe bir1, human survivin, and C. elegans BIR-2 and BIR-1. A comprehensive analysis of cell cycle-regulated genes in yeast indicates that BIR1 transcription does not change during the cell cycle (21.Payne W.E. Fitzgerald-Hayes M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4351-4364Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), in contrast to human survivin (12.Li F. Ambrosini G. Chu E.Y. Plescia J. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C. Nature. 1998; 396: 580-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). To determine the in vivo function of BIR1, we constructed a gene disruption mutation in the diploid strain YPH501. Cells were transformed with a construct in which the entire coding region had been replaced with a nutritional marker (bir1::URA3, bir1Δ). Gene disruption mutants were confirmed by PCR and sporulated, and the resulting tetrads were dissected and allowed to grow on rich (YPD) medium. For one of the BIR1/bir1Δ mutants (strain YPH501-B2), sporulation yielded two viable and two nonviable spore products. The viable cells failed to grow in medium lacking uracil, confirming that the bir1::URA3mutation is lethal. However, another mutant (YPH501-B9) yielded a complex pattern of spore products, some of which were viable but also able to grow in uracil-free medium. The segregation pattern for YPH501-B9 did not match that expected for a simple suppressor mutation. We thus considered whether this strain had undergone endoreduplication, resulting in a higher than normal number of chromosomes. To test for this possibility, we measured the DNA content of YPH501-B9 using FACS analysis. Both the BIR1 and the bir1Δ mutants and the corresponding wild-type strains were characterized in this manner, as described in Fig.1. YPH501 and YPH499 are wild-type diploid and haploid strains, respectively. As expected, YPH501 and YPH501-B2 each exhibited a normal (2 n + 4 n) pattern of DNA content. In contrast, YPH501-B9 had major peaks corresponding to 4 and 6 n DNA. A third mutant, YPH501-B6, contained 3 or 5 n DNA. We also characterized a viable, URA+ spore product from YPH501-B9 (designated YPH499-B9). Compared with the normal haploid strain YPH499, the YPH499-B9 mutant strain had twice the normal DNA content (2 and 4 n) (Fig.1). Again, bir1Δ haploid mutants were not viable and could not be analyzed by FACS. We then examined each of the mutants by DIC microscopy (Fig.2). Compared with the wild-type parent strain, YPH501, both the YPH501-B2 and YPH501-B9 mutants exhibited aberrant cell morphology, with mis-shapen buds connected to an unusually large mother cell. The YPH499-B9 mutant also had an altered cell morphology, except that the bud neck was grossly elongated in most cases. This morphology is distinct from that seen during pseudohyphal differentiation, because disruption or overexpression ofBIR1 does not influence the formation of pseudohyphae resulting from nitrogen starvation or from permanently differentiatedelm1 or tec1 mutant cells (22.Uren A.G. Beilharz T. O'Connell M.J. Bugg S.J. van Driel R. Vaux D.L. Lithgow T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10170-10175Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Enlarged cells are often the consequence of slower cell division. Thus, we examined the ability of each mutant to grow in liquid medium (Fig.3 A). Compared with the wild-type YPH501, which had a doubling time of 107 min, YPH501-B2, YPH501-B6, and YPH501-B9 grew somewhat more slowly, with doubling times of 122, 122, and 134 min, respectively. Compared with the parent haploid strain, YPH499, the doubling time of YPH499-B9 was similarly increased (from 124 to 166 min). To determine whether thebir1Δ mutant was responsible for this slow-growth phenotype, YPH499 and YPH499-B9 were transformed with a plasmid-borne copy of BIR1 or the parent vector alone. As described in Fig. 3 B, the mutant carrying the empty vector grew slowly (180 min, doubling time), whereas mutants carrying BIR1 on a plasmid doubled at a rate (157 min) comparable with that of the wild type carrying the vector (152 min) or BIR1 (150 min) (Fig.3 B). We then examined the consequences of BIR1 over-expression. Our rationale was that if a reduction in gene copy number leads to a slow-growth phenotype, an increase in expression might accelerate growth. Wild-type YPH501 cells were transformed with a plasmid containing full-length BIR1 expressed using a strong constitutive promoter from ADH1. As described in Fig.4, BIR1 over-expressing cells doubled at a rate considerably faster (111 min) than non-over-expressing cells (146 min) (Fig. 4 A). To determine whether the BIR homology was responsible for the enhanced growth, we tested a C-terminally truncated form of the protein containing only the two BIR domains (residues 1–251, designated N-Bir1). As a control, we also tested the reciprocal construct containing an N-terminally truncated protein lacking the BIR domains (residues 252–954, C-Bir1). As shown in Fig. 4, the rate enhancement by N-Bir1 nearly matched that of the full-length protein Bir1, whereas the C-Bir1 mutant behaved like the empty vector. N-Bir1 was also able to partially complement the slow growth phenotype of the YPH499-B9 and YPH501-B9 mutants (data not shown). BIR proteins are remarkably well conserved across species. To determine whether this conservation of sequence translates into conservation of function, we tested the ability of survivin (12.Li F. Ambrosini G. Chu E.Y. Plescia J. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C. Nature. 1998; 396: 580-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar) to function in place of BIR1 in yeast. Survivin was selected because it is the closest human homologue and the smallest member of the family (6.Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar, 7.LaCasse E.C. Baird S. Korneluk R.G. MacKenzie A.E. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3247-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar) and is therefore likely to be efficiently expressed in yeast. Wild-type YPH501 cells were transformed with full-length survivin, a C-terminally truncated form of the protein containing only the BIR domain (N-survivin), an N-terminally truncated form lacking the BIR domain (C-survivin), or the empty vector alone. As described in Fig.4 B, the empty vector and wild-type human survivin had no effect on the doubling time of these cells. However, N-survivin (which contains the BIR domain) exhibited a dramatic reduction in the rate of cell doubling, from 163 to 243 min. C-survivin had only a modest growth inhibitory effect (181 min). Thus, the survivin BIR domain appears to act in a dominant-negative manner to inhibit cell division. Finally, we noticed that yeast expressing survivin exhibit an increased susceptibility to lysis in low osmotic solutions. When cells were transferred from synthetic medium to water, approximately 10% of the cells underwent spontaneous lysis. A similar “cell integrity” defect has been described for a variety of mutants and is thought to indicate a defect in cell wall synthesis (21.Payne W.E. Fitzgerald-Hayes M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4351-4364Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 23.Levin D.E. Fields F.O. Kunisawa R. Bishop J.M. Thorner J. Cell. 1990; 62: 213-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The effect was exacerbated by growth at high temperatures and ameliorated by growth at low temperatures and in an osmotically balanced solution of 1m sorbitol. As shown in Fig.5, YPH501 cells expressing full-length survivin showed a marked decrease in viability on plates maintained at 34 °C as compared with vector alone. A less severe defect was exhibited by the N-survivin and C-survivin constructs. This defect was reversed by growth in 1 m sorbitol, by growth in dextrose (which represses survivin expression), or both. A cell integrity defect was not seen in any of the bir1Δ mutant strains described above or in cells overexpressing wild-type Bir1. Thus, the phenotype is unique to yeast that express survivin or the survivin BIR domain (N-survivin). It is also distinct from the slow growth phenotype described in Fig. 4, where full-length survivin had no effect. Regardless, either of the growth phenotypes could be useful for yeast-based genetic screens for IAP-domain mutants in survivin. The main conclusion that can be drawn from these studies is that inactivation of the IAP gene, BIR1, causes a pleiotropic cell division defect in yeast, with dysregulation of cellular ploidy, cell growth rate, and overall cell morphology. The identification of IAP homologous genes in yeast, which are not believed to implement an apoptosis program (14.Fraser A. James C. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 219-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), has suggested the potential participation of these molecules in functions other than apoptosis control, particularly in the cell division control pathway. In support of this view, we found that BIR1 is essential for cell viability and that an increase or decrease in the BIR1 copy number will accelerate or decelerate cell division, respectively. This view is further reinforced by the cell cycle-regulated expression and localization to the mitotic apparatus of the mammalian IAP homologue, survivin (12.Li F. Ambrosini G. Chu E.Y. Plescia J. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C. Nature. 1998; 396: 580-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar), and by the multinucleation and cytokinesis defect resulting from targeting a single BIR molecule, BIR-1, in C. elegans (13.Fraser A.G. James C. Evan G.I. Hengartner M.O. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 292-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Very recently, Uren et al. (22.Uren A.G. Beilharz T. O'Connell M.J. Bugg S.J. van Driel R. Vaux D.L. Lithgow T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10170-10175Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) described their efforts to disrupt BIR1 in yeast. Consistent with our findings, they observed inefficient sporulation and germination of both heterozygous and homozygous diploid mutants, with only a small percentage of viable spore products and an unusual bud morphology. In striking contrast to our findings, however, they conclude that homozygous diploid and haploid mutants are viable. They acknowledge that this could have resulted from “maldistribution of DNA” during cell division, but they did not test that possibility directly (e.g. by FACS). Nor did they attempt to confirm the genotype of their “diploid” mutants. Finally, and not surprisingly, they were also unable to demonstrate complementation by plasmid-borne BIR1. Thus, the rare viable spore products that they obtained are likely to have been polyploid, as documented here. Although the molecular ordering of the cell division control pathway coordinated by BIR1 in yeast has not been elucidated, the pleiotropic nature of the defect in diploid mutants reveals a likely role in cytokinesis and control of cytoskeletal and cell wall integrity. This function was recapitulated by the isolated BIR domain, a potential Cys/His-based zinc finger fold (9.Hinds M.G. Norton R.S. Vaux D.L. Day C.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 648-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), known to participate in apoptosis inhibition by certain mammalian IAP proteins (6.Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar, 7.LaCasse E.C. Baird S. Korneluk R.G. MacKenzie A.E. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3247-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Interestingly, heterologous expression of survivin (11.Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D.C. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (3016) Google Scholar) also resulted in dysregulation of cell growth rate, thus emphasizing the high degree of evolutionary and functional conservation among IAP proteins. Altogether, these data are consistent with a potential unifying model in which “ancient” IAP proteins (20.Uren A.G. Coulson E.J. Vaux D.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 159-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), containing a single BIR module, are primarily involved in cell division control rather than regulation of apoptosis. More recently diverged IAP proteins may have further evolved a specialized function of suppression of apoptosis through a direct BIR-dependent interaction with terminal effector caspases (6.Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar, 7.LaCasse E.C. Baird S. Korneluk R.G. MacKenzie A.E. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3247-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, human survivin may provide an adaptation between these two evolutionarily conserved processes for its cell cycle-dependent expression in mitosis, localization to the mitotic apparatus (12.Li F. Ambrosini G. Chu E.Y. Plescia J. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C. Nature. 1998; 396: 580-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar), and caspase-inhibitory properties (6.Deveraux Q.L.

https://openalex.org/W2038523895,"The cytochrome P450 1B1 gene (CYP1B1) is expressed constitutively and is inducible by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) in the human breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF-7 but not in the human hepatoma cell line HepG2. Genomic DNA isolated from both cell lines was digested with the methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme isoschizomers MspI and HpaII, and subjected to Southern analysis with a probe for the CYP1B1 promoter/enhancer region. Although differences were observed in methylation patterns for the CYP1B1 gene from MCF-7 and HepG2 cells, treatment with the demethylating agent 5-azacytidine (10 microM for 6 days) did not activate CYP1B1 mRNA expression in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (100 nM for 24 h) did not activate CYP1B1 mRNA expression in HepG2 cells. Comparative analysis of the constitutive expression of luciferase/1B1 reporter constructs containing a series of deletions in the 5' enhancer region indicated that in MCF-7 cells the region from -987 to -732 (relative to the transcription start site) was necessary for maximal levels of activity. Mutation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor response elements (dioxin response elements) in this region showed that the dioxin response elements located at -833 is essential for constitutive gene expression in MCF-7 cells. In HepG2 cells, reporter gene activity was at least equal or greater than the activity observed in MCF-7 cells, which is in marked contrast to the expression of the native CYP1B1 gene. Taken together these findings indicate that the observed cell-specific differences in CYP1B1 constitutive expression are not mediated by DNA promoter/enhancer methylation, but are likely due to either 1) inaccessibility of the 5'-enhancer region in HepG2 cells to transcriptional activators due to a higher order chromatin structure that does not involve histone acetylation, or 2) the action of a repressor protein at cis-elements located outside of the -2296 to +25 region examined with the CYP1B1 reporter constructs. Furthermore, at least one of the dioxin response elements in the enhancer region is required for constitutive expression of CYP1B1."
https://openalex.org/W2032863372,"Connexin (Cx) 45.6, an avian counterpart of rodent Cx50, is phosphorylated in vivo, but the sites and function of the phosphorylation have not been elucidated. Our peptide mapping experiments showed that the Ser363 site in the carboxyl (COOH) terminus of Cx45.6 was phosphorylated and that this site is within casein kinase (CK) II consensus sequence, although showing some similarity to CKI sequence. The peptide containing Ser363 could be phosphorylated in vitro by CKII, but not by CKI. Furthermore, CKII phosphorylated Cx45.6 in embryonic lens membrane and the fusion protein containing the COOH terminus of Cx45.6. Two-dimensional peptide mapping experiments showed that one of the Cx45.6 peptides phosphorylated in vivomigrated to the same spot as one of those phosphorylated by CKIIin vitro. Furthermore, CKII activity could be detected in lens lysates. To assess the function of this phosphorylation event, exogenous wild type and mutant Cx45.6 (Ser363 → Ala) were expressed in lens primary cultures by retroviral infection. The mutant Cx45.6 was shown to be more stable having a longer half-life compared with wild type Cx45.6. Together, the evidence suggests that CKII is likely a kinase responsible for the Ser363 phosphorylation, leading to the destablization and degradation of Cx45.6. The connexin degradation induced by phosphorylation has a broad functional significance in the regulation of gap junctions in vivo.

The connexin degradation induced by phosphorylation has a broad functional significance in the regulation of gap junctions in vivo. protein kinase C connexin casein kinase I casein kinase II glutathione S-transferase mass spectrometry polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Tos-PheCH2Cl 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid Gap junctions are channels between two adjacent cells, which allow passage of small molecules (M r ≤ 1000) such as small metabolites, ions, and second messengers. The gap junction-mediated cell-to-cell communications are important in maintaining cell and tissue functions (1.Bennet M.V.L. Goodenough D.A. Neurosci. Res. Prog. Bull. 1978; 16: 373-486Google Scholar). The structural components of gap junctions are members of a family of related membrane proteins called connexins, which consist of four conserved transmembrane domains and two extracellular loops, while their cytoplasmic regions are unique. The COOH terminus, the most variable region among connexins, contains several putative kinase consensus sequences. The phosphorylation of connexins has been indicated in the intracellular trafficking of connexins (2.Puranam K.I. Laird D.W. Revel J.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 206: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), channel assembly (3.Musil L.S. Goodenough D.A. J.

Revel J.P. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 97: 109-117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The vertebrate eye lens is one of the important model systems used in the study of the function and regulation of gap junctions. The lens is an avascular organ formed by an anterior epithelial cell layer and highly differentiated fiber cells. To maintain their metabolic activities and homeostasis, the cells inside the lens must depend fully on extensive networks of gap junction-mediated cell-to-cell communications with the cells on the lens surfaces (8.Goodenough D.A. Semin. Cell Biol. 1992; 3: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), although the report by Bassnett et al. (9.Bassnett S. Kuszak J.R. Reinish L. Brown H.G. Beebe D.C. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 799-811PubMed Google Scholar) shows the lack of gap junction-mediated transport from the lens epithelium to the fibers. Primary cultures of chick lens closely mimic in vivo lens cell differentiation processes in which monolayer lens epithelial cells differentiate into structures called “lentoids” having features of differentiated lens fibers (10.Piatigorsky J. Rothschile S.S. Milstone L.M. Dev. Biol. 1973; 34: 334-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 11.Menko A.S. Klukas K.A. Johnson R.G. Dev. Biol. 1984; 103: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Lens fiber connexins in the chick primary cultures are phosphorylated similarly to the in vivophosphorylated connexins (12.Jiang J.X. Goodenough D.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 13.Berthoud V.M. Beyer E.C. Kurata W.E. Lau A.F. Lampe P.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), while those in the primary cultures of rodent and bovine lenses are not processed into proper phosphorylated forms (14.Jiang J.X. Paul D.L. Goodenough D.A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1993; 34: 3558-3564PubMed Google Scholar). There are three connexins identified in the chick lens: Cx43, which is expressed in anterior lens epithelial cells and in the lens bow region (15.Rup D.M. Veenstra R.D. Wang H.-Z. Brink P.R. Beyer E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 706-712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Cx45.6 and Cx56, which are present mainly in lens fiber cells (16.Jiang J.X. White T.W. Goodenough D.A. Paul D.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 17.Jiang J.X. White T.W. Goodenough D.A. Dev. Biol. 1995; 168: 649-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and to a lesser degree in junctions between epithelial cells (17.Jiang J.X. White T.W. Goodenough D.A. Dev. Biol. 1995; 168: 649-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 18.Dahm R. van Marle J. Prescott A.R. Quinlan R.A. Exp. Eye Res. 1999; 69: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). All three connexins are phosphoproteins (16.Jiang J.X. White T.W. Goodenough D.A. Paul D.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 19.Musil L.S. Beyer E.C.

Sci. 1994; 35: 4109-4117PubMed Google Scholar). PKC1 is one of the kinases that may be involved in the phosphorylation of lens fiber connexins (12.Jiang J.X. Goodenough D.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 13.Berthoud V.M. Beyer E.C. Kurata W.E. Lau A.F. Lampe P.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Two potential phosphorylation sites of Cx56 stimulated by PKC activator, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate have been localized at the intercellular loop and COOH-terminal regions (13.Berthoud V.M. Beyer E.C. Kurata W.E. Lau A.F. Lampe P.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Besides other potential roles of connexin phosphorylation, one functional feature of phosphorylation involves either stabilization or destabilization of various connexins in different systems. Phosphorylation-induced degradation of Cx43 has been observed in rat liver epithelial cells following 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate treatment (21.Mastesic D.F. Rupp H.L. Bonney W.J. Ruch R.J. Trosko J.E. Mol. Carcinog. 1994; 10: 226-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and in mouse keratinocytes following hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor treatment (22.Moorby C.D. Stoker M. Gherardi E. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Stimulation of Cx43 phosphorylation by platelet-derived growth factor correlates with a faster turnover of Cx43 utilizing the lysosomal pathway (23.Hossain M.Z., AO, P. Boynton A.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 174: 66-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In contrast, for mouse Cx45 it has been shown that decreased phosphorylation coincided with degradation of this protein (2.Puranam K.I. Laird D.W. Revel J.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 206: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The substitution of one or more serine residues for other amino acids increases degradation of the transfected Cx45 in HeLa cells (5.Hertlein B. Butterweck A. Haubrich S. Willecke K. Traub O. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 162: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Since in vivo phosphorylation sites for any of the above mentioned connexins have not been mapped, the direct relationship between in vivo phosphorylation and connexin degradation is not clear. In the vertebrate lenses, the phosphorylation of chick fiber Cx56 is apparently involved in the stability of the protein (24.Berthoud V.M. Bassnett S. Beyer E.C. Exp. Eye Res. 1999; 68: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation level of lens fiber connexins increases and is associated with lens development (14.Jiang J.X. Paul D.L. Goodenough D.A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1993; 34: 3558-3564PubMed Google Scholar), but the exact nature of this increase has not been elucidated. In the center of the lens referred to as the lens nucleus, the more differentiated region, sheep lens Cx49, the ovine homologue of Cx45.6 is cleaved at the COOH-terminal region by calpain, a Ca2+-dependent protease (25.Lin J.S. Fitzgerald S. Dong Y. Knight C. Donaldson P. Kistler J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 141-149PubMed Google Scholar). Although mechanisms and functions of connexin phosphorylation have been studied extensively, the exact roles of in vivophosphorylation, particularly the direct correlation to a specificin vivo phosphorylation site to its function, are less certain. To the extent of our knowledge, this is the case for all connexins. In this report, we show directly by peptide mapping and tandem mass spectrometric (MS) sequencing that Cx45.6 is phosphorylatedin vivo at Ser363 in the COOH-terminal domain. Ser363 is localized within CKII phosphorylation consensus sequence (26.Songyang Z. Lu K. Kwon T.Y. Tsai L. Filhol O. Cochet C. Brickey D. Soderling R.T. Bartleson C. Graves J.D. Demaggio J.A. Hoekstra F.M. Blenis J. Hunter T. Cantley L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 16: 6486-6493Crossref Scopus (484) Google Scholar). CKII is a cyclic nucleotide- and calcium-independent serine/threonine protein kinase (26.Songyang Z. Lu K. Kwon T.Y. Tsai L. Filhol O. Cochet C. Brickey D. Soderling R.T. Bartleson C. Graves J.D. Demaggio J.A. Hoekstra F.M. Blenis J. Hunter T. Cantley L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 16: 6486-6493Crossref Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Our in vitro andin vivo analyses confirmed that Cx45.6 is phosphorylated by CKII. To explore the functional significance of Ser363phosphorylation, we expressed exogenous wild type Cx45.6 and mutant Cx45.6 (Ser363 → Ala) into chick lens primary cell cultures using a retroviral approach. Pulse-chase experiments revealed that the mutant Cx45.6 lacking Ser363 had an extended half-life compared with the wild type Cx45.6. The results suggest that phosphorylation of Ser363 by CKII may provide signal(s) for Cx45.6 destablization and degradation, which may lead to the in vivo regulation of gap junctions. Fertilized chicken eggs were obtained from SPAFAS (Roanoke, IL) and Tyson Hatchery (Gongalez, TX). CKII, hepain, and CKI consensus peptide (RRKDLHDDEEDEAMSITA) were obtained from Sigma. CKI was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). The peptide derived from Cx45.6 (358RRREEEVVS363DEVE367), and CKII consensus peptide (RRREEETEEE) were synthesized in the Institutional Peptide Laboratory. PKCα peptide, (CGTPEYLAPEIRR) was kindly provided by Dr. F. Liu at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. Whatman P81 phosphocellulose paper was from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA). [γ-32P]ATP and [35S]methionine were from NEN Life Science Products Inc. (Boston, MA). H3[32P]O4 was obtained from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). P27 (anti-gag) antibody was from SPAFAS (Norwich, CT). Tissue culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). TPCK-treated trypsin was from Worthington Biochemical (Lakewood, NJ). TLC plates and mouse anti-FLAG antisera were from Eastman Kodak (Rochester, NY). Samples, including Western blots and immunoprecipitates, were analyzed on 10 or 12% SDS-PAGE according to the method of Laemmli (27.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Gels loaded with 35S-labeled samples were processed for fluorography by incubation in 1 m salicylic acid for 30 min prior to drying. The protein bands were quantified by Image-pro Plus Program (Media Cybernetic, Rochester, NY). For gels loaded with32P-labeled samples, intensifying screens were used. Western blots of proteins were performed by probing with either anti-FLAG or affinity-purified anti-Cx45.6 antibody. Primary antibodies were detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibody. Approximately 950 intact lenses were dissected out from 500 embryonic day 18 fertilized chicken eggs. The lenses were rinsed several times in phosphate-buffered saline to free attached cell and tissue debris. The lens membranes were then prepared based on a previously described procedure with some modifications (12.Jiang J.X. Goodenough D.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 19.Musil L.S. Beyer E.C. Goodenough D.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 116: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Briefly, lenses were lysed and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g (Beckman, 28,000 rpm, SW60TI rotor) for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended in 20 mm prechilled NaOH to eliminate periplasmic proteins and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitation was preformed with affinity purified anti-Cx45.6 antibodies covalently conjugated to protein A-Sepharose through a chemical cross-linker, dimethyl pimelimidate as described (28.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The detailed procedure for preparation and affinity purification of anti-Cx45.6 antibody was as described by Jiang et al. (16.Jiang J.X. White T.W. Goodenough D.A. Paul D.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). After immunoprecipitation, approximately 500 μl of samples were isolated and concentrated to 50 μl through ULTRAFREE-MC 30 000 NNMWL Filter Unit (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The samples were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE (midi-gel, 16 cm long). The gels were stained with Commassie Blue (0.1% Commassie Blue R-250 in 40% methanol, 0.1% acetic acid) for 1 h and destained (40% ethanol and 10% acetic acid) until the protein bands were visible. All solutions used in above experiments were filtered through 0.5-μm filters. SDS-PAGE purified Cx45.6 bands were excised and digested in situ overnight (for protocol, see Ref. 29.Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7736) Google Scholar) in Eppendorf tubes at 37 °C with modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) at an approximate ratio of 10:1 (protein:enzyme). A fraction of each digest was purified over Poros R2 50 (Perseptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) microcolumns and eluted into nanospray needles (Protana, Denmark) with 5% formic acid and 50% acetonitrile (for details, see Ref. 29.Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7736) Google Scholar). Nanoelectrospray mass spectra were acquired on a Finnigan LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer (San Jose, CA) equipped with an ESI ion source. The standard spray needle assembly was replaced with a nanospray source of in-house design (30.Jedrzejewski P.T. Lehmann W.D. Anal. Chem. 1997; 69: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Solutions were sprayed with a needle potential of about +0.8 kV. Tandem MS spectra were acquired with relative CID of between 20 and 35%. The experimental procedures for peptide phosphorylation by CKII/CKI were based on the established methods (31, CKI Users Manual, Promega) with some modifications. The peptide phosphorylation was initiated by addition of 0.5 μl of CKII (122 unit/ml) or 1 μl of CKI (10 unit/ml) to 25 μl of CKII or CKI phosphorylation buffer plus 1 mm synthetic peptides. CKII phosphorylation buffer contained 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The substrate peptides in CKII reaction included RRREEEVVS363DEVE (Cx45.6, amino acids 358–367) (with or without 80 μg/ml heparin), RRREEETEEE (CKII, consensus peptide), or CGTPEYLAPEIRR (PKCα peptide). CKI buffer contained 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The substrate peptides in CKI reaction included a peptide of Cx45.6 amino acids 358–367, RRKDLHDDEEDEAMSITA (CKI, consensus peptide) or CKII consensus peptide. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, the reaction was terminated by 10% trichloroacetic acid (w/v). The sample was kept on ice for 10 min prior to centrifugation at 13,000 ×g for 5 min. Fifteen microliter supernatant was spotted on a 2.5-cm Whatman P81 phosphocellulose paper and then washed extensively with 0.75% phosphoric acid (w/v) 5 min each three times and washed with acetone once. When dry, the paper was transferred to a scintillation vial to measure radioactivity using a Packard counter (Meriden, CT). Fusion proteins containing GST plus the COOH-terminal region of Cx45.6, amino acid 237–400, was produced using the vector pGEX-2T (32.Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). The detailed procedures for purification of fusion protein were described previously (16.Jiang J.X. White T.W. Goodenough D.A. Paul D.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The lens membranes were isolated as described above (33.Jiang X.J. Goodenough D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1287-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The purified GST-Cx45.6 fusion protein and lens membranes were used for phosphorylation reactions by CKII similar to the above peptide phosphorylation with some modifications: 1 to 5 μg of GST fusion protein or lens membrane were used and the reaction lasted for 2 h. The reaction was terminated by boiling for 5 min in the presence of 0.6% SDS. Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed with in vitro phosphorylated lens membrane samples by Cx45.6 affinity purified antibody as described previously (33.Jiang X.J. Goodenough D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1287-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Intact lenses were removed from embryonic day 9 chicken as described previously (12.Jiang J.X. Goodenough D.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and washed three times with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The lenses were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h in the 32P labeling medium containing phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 0.4 mCi/ml H3[32P]O4. Two-dimensional peptide mapping experiments were performed based on modified procedures as described previously (12.Jiang J.X. Goodenough D.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, in vitro phosphorylated GST-Cx45.6 fusion protein and immunoprecipated samples of 32P-labeled lens organ culture were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE. The labeled bands were identified by autoradiography and excised from dried gels. The gel slices were washed with 30% methanol several times and incubated at room temperature for 16 h. The gel slices were dried completely in speed vacuum and rehydrated into 200 μl of TPCK-treated trypsin (10 mg/ml) in 50 mm NH4HCO3 (pH 8.0) at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by the addition of 100 μl of trypsin every 20 min three times and incubated for 16 h. The supernatant was transferred, dried, and washed several times with dH2O. The final tryptic digested products were resuspended in electrophoresis buffer and separated on two-dimensional TLC using the procedure described by Boyle et al. (34.Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). The first dimension on TLC was separated by electrophoresis at a buffer pH of 1.9 and the second dimension by chromatography in phosphochromatography buffer. The CKII activity assay was initiated by the addition of embryonic day 16 lens lysate containing 5–10 μg of proteins to CKII phosphorylation buffer (20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 10 mmMgCl2, 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 150 mmNaCl, 2 mm Na3VO4, 2 mmEDTA, and 25 mm β-glycerolphosphate) plus or minus 2 mm peptides. The peptides used for the assay included the above described CKII consensus peptide and PKCα peptide. Another control experiment included CKII phosphorylation buffer and CKII consensus peptide without lens lysate. The specific inhibition of CKII activity in chick lenses by heparin was done by adding various concentrations of heparin to lens lysate dissolved in CKII phosphorylation buffer. The remaining procedures for CKII activity assay were exactly the same as described above for in vitrophosphorylation of synthetic peptides. Preparation of retroviral constructs and high-titer viruses was based on the published procedure with modifications (35.Schwarz E.M. Antwerp D.V. Verma I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3554-3559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, DNA fragments containing wild type and mutant Cx45.6 (Ser363 → Ala) were made by polymerase chain reaction. The codon (AGC)encoding Ser363 was changed to (GCC) encoding Ala in one of the two oligonucleotide primer sequences required for mutant Cx45.6 (Ser363 → Ala) synthesis. COOH termini of both wild type and mutant Cx45.6 were epitope-tagged with FLAG sequences to distinguish the exogenous from endogenous connexins.NcoI/EcoRI restriction sites were created at NH2- and COOH-terminal ends of the DNA fragments, respectively. The polymerase chain reaction products were subcloned into an adapter vector, ClaI2NCO, which shared the sameClaI restriction site as retroviral vector, RCAS(A) (36.Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar). To ensure the correct sequence of the constructs, the DNA fragments were sequenced at the Institutional DNA Sequencing Facility. Connexin fragments were isolated following digestion with ClaI and subcloned into ClaI-linearized RCAS(A). The constructs with the correct inserts were selected and transfected into retrovirus packaging cells, chick embryonic fibroblast and the expression of Cx45.6 was detected by Western blots with anti-FLAG antibody (Eastman Kodak) and affinity purified Cx45.6 antibody. When the transfected chick embryonic fibroblast cells became confluent, they were split in the following order: 60-mm plate → 100-mm plate → 150-mm plate → five 150-mm plates. The culture media were collected consecutively for 3 days from five 150-mm dishes when the cells became confluent. The retroviruses in the culture medium were concentrated by centrifugation at 72,000 × g (Beckmann, 22,000 rpm, SW60 TI rotor) for 2 h and tittered by gag staining as described (37.Fkete D.M. Cepko C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2604-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), and the high titer of viruses were prepared (1–5 × 108colony forming units/ml). The lens primary cultures were prepared following the procedure described previously (19.Musil L.S. Beyer E.C. Goodenough D.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 116: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Briefly, chick lenses dissected from day 11 embryos were washed in buffer containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.7 mm Na2HPO4, 5 mmglucose, 25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4). The intact lenses freed of digested extracapsular tissues were ruptured after incubation in 0.1% trypsin for 30 min. Dissociated cells were then pelleted by low speed centrifugation (150 × g) for 5 min, resuspended in culture medium (medium 199 with Earle's salts and 10% fetal calf serum). 1 × 106 cells were plated in 35-mm tissue culture plates. High-titer retroviruses (5 μl/dish) carrying either wild type Cx45.6 or mutant Cx45.6 (Ser363 → Ala) cDNA were used to infect monolayer primary lens epithelial cultures the next day. The cultures were fed daily and used for labeling after a week when cells became 80–90% confluent and formed lens fiber-like lentoid structures (11.Menko A.S. Klukas K.A. Johnson R.G. Dev. Biol. 1984; 103: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The cultures were rinsed three times with the labeling medium (methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum, 20 μm methionine) and incubated in 1 ml above labeling medium plus 0.5 mCi of [35S]methionine for 3 h. Then the cultures were rinsed with complete medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.5 mm methionine and 10% fetal calf serum) and incubated in the non-radioactive medium for various chase periods. Prior studies have shown that Cx45.6 is a phosphoprotein (12.Jiang J.X. Goodenough D.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 16.Jiang J.X. White T.W. Goodenough D.A. Paul D.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To determine the nature of the phosphorylation, we analyzed Cx45.6 by nanoelectrospray MS. Cx45.6 derived from embryonic chick lens was purified by immunoprecipitation followed by SDS-PAGE and the appropriate bands were excised and digested with trypsin in situ. Subsequent nanoelectrospray MS analyses resulted in a tryptic map (Fig.1 A). From this peptide map based on the Cx45.6 sequence, a number of peptides were assigned. Surprisingly, one peptide (see T37–38(Sp)2+ in Fig.1 A) was observed which corresponded to the expected tryptic peptide, T37–38, but was heavier by the mass of one phosphate group (plus 79.4). For this peptide multiple signals (atm/z 1354.5, 903.4 corresponding to doubly and singly charged peptides, respectively) were observed in high resolution scans (data not shown) permitting definite charge and mass assignment. In order to verify the exact phosphorylation site for this peptide, tandem MS experiments were performed. Fig. 1 B shows the tandem MS spectrum for the T37–38(Sp) phosphopeptide. As indicated in this figure, both NH2 terminus-derived fragment ions as well as COOH terminus-derived fragment ions allowed for unambiguous assignment of the phosphorylation site to Ser363. In general, tandem MS spectra of phosphopeptides show a characteristic loss of phosphate group(s). As indicated by the strong signal atm/z 1305.1, the tandem MS spectrum for the T37–38(Sp) peptide also contained this signature fragment ion. These results unambiguously confirm the presence of an in vivophosphorylation site at Ser363 for Cx45.6 in chick lens. Two major features are characteristic of CKII-specific phosphorylation sites: 1) phosphorylated peptides are enriched in Glu and Asp; 2) acidic amino acids are preferred at the positions close to the COOH-terminal side of Ser/Thr rather than those to the NH2-terminal side (26.Songyang Z. Lu K. Kwon T.Y. Tsai L. Filhol O. Cochet C. Brickey D. Soderling R.T. Bartleson C. Graves J.D. Demaggio J.A. Hoekstra F.M. Blenis J. Hunter T. Cantley L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 16: 6486-6493Crossref Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The peptide sequence containing Ser363 in the COOH terminus of Cx45.6 is: E358EEVVS363DEVE367, which satisfies both criteria as potential consensus sequences for CKII. In addition, this peptide sequence has a Glu residue at the −3 position NH2-terminal to the target Ser363 and satisfies the CKI consensus sequence requirement for an acidic residue, three residues to the amino-terminal side of the target Ser/Thr (26.Songyang Z. Lu K. Kwon T.Y. Tsai L. Filhol O. Cochet C. Brickey D. Soderling R.T. Bartleson C. Graves J.D. Demaggio J.A. Hoekstra F.M. Blenis J. Hunter T. Cantley L. Mol. Biol.

The sequence of the cDNA clone of ST6GalNAc VI encoded a type II membrane protein with 43 amino acids composing the cytoplasmic domain, 21 amino acids composing the transmembrane region, and 269 amino acids composing the catalytic domain. The predicted amino acid sequence showed homology to the previously cloned ST6GalNAc III, IV, and V, with common amino acid sequences in sialyl motif L and S among these four enzymes. A fusion protein with protein A and extracts from L cells transfected with ST6GalNAc VI in an expression vector showed enzyme activity of alpha2,6-sialyltransferase for GM1b, GT1b, and GD1a but not toward glycoproteins. Thin layer chromatography-immunostaining revealed that the products were GD1alpha, GQ1balpha, and GT1aalpha. Northern blotting revealed that this gene was expressed in a wide range of mouse tissues such as colon, liver, heart, spleen, and brain. It is concluded that this enzyme is a novel sialyltransferase involved in the synthesis of alpha-series gangliosides in the nervous tissues and many other tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2065246237,"The serotype c-specific polysaccharide antigen ofActinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans NCTC 9710 contains an unusual sugar, 6-deoxy-l-talose, which has been identified as a constituent of cell wall components in some bacteria. Two genes coding for thymidine diphosphate (dTDP)-6-deoxy-l-lyxo-4-hexulose reductases were identified in the gene cluster required for biosynthesis of serotype c-specific polysaccharide. Both dTDP-6-deoxy-l-lyxo-4-hexulose reductases were overproduced and purified from Escherichia coli transformed with the plasmids containing these genes. The sugar nucleotides converted by both reductases were purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography and identified by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance and gas-liquid chromatography. The results indicated that one of two reductases produced dTDP-6-deoxy-l-talose and the other produced dTDP-l-rhamnose (dTDP-6-deoxy-l-mannose). The amino acid sequence of the dTDP-6-deoxy-l-lyxo-4-hexulose reductase forming dTDP-6-deoxy-l-talose shared only weak homology with that forming dTDP-l-rhamnose, despite the fact that these two enzymes catalyze the reduction of the same substrate and the products are determined by the stereospecificity of the reductase activity. Neither the gene for dTDP-6-deoxy-l-talose biosynthesis nor its corresponding protein product has been found in other bacteria; this biosynthetic pathway is identified here for the first time.

The polysaccharides often constitute the outermost layer of the cell, and they have been implicated as virulence factors for many animal and plant pathogens (1.Robert I.S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 285-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Serotype c-specific antigen ofActinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is 6-deoxy-l-talan, which is acetylated at the O-2 position of 1,3-linked 6-deoxy-l-talose (2.Shibuya N. Amano K. Azuma J. Nishihara T. Kitamura Y. Noguchi T. Koga T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16318-16323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This polysaccharide is considered to play an important role in A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype c pathogenesis (3.Califano J.V. Schenkein H.A. Tew J.G. Oral Microbiol. Immunol. 1991; 6: 228-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 4.Takahashi T. Nishihara T. Ishihara Y. Amano K. Shibuya N. Moro I. Koga T. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 18-23Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polysaccharides consisting of only 6-deoxytalose are rare, although 6-deoxytalose has been reported as a constituent of several microbial polysaccharides (5.Jann B. Shashkov A. Torgov V. Kochanowski H. Seltmann G. Jann K. Carbohydr. Res. 1995; 278: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 6.Zähringer U. Rettenmaier H. Moll H. Senchenkova S.N. Knirel Y.A. Carbohydr. Res. 1997; 300: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Except for serotype c-specific polysaccharide from A. actinomycetemcomitans, only the O-chain of lipopolysaccharide from Rhizobium loti NZP 2213 has been reported as a homopolymer composed solely of 6-deoxy-l-talose (7.Russa R. Urbanik-Sypniewska T. Lindström K. Mayer H. Arch. Microbiol. 1995; 163: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In addition, other serotype-specific polysaccharides of A. actinomycetemcomitans also contain rare sugars as constituents of microbial polysaccharides; examples include d-fucose in serotype b-specific polysaccharide (8.Amano K. Nishihara T. Shibuya N. Noguchi T. Koga T. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 2942-2946Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 6-deoxy-d-talose in serotype a-specific polysaccharide (2.Shibuya N. Amano K. Azuma J. Nishihara T. Kitamura Y. Noguchi T. Koga T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16318-16323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In 1973, 6-deoxy-l-talose was characterized as an unusual sugar, and the instability of dTDP-6-deoxy-l-talose, which is the activated nucleotide sugar form of 6-deoxy-l-talose, was reported (9.Gaugler R.W. Gabriel O. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6041-6049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity of the biosynthetic pathway of this sugar nucleotide in a cell-free extract of Escherichia coli O45 was also characterized in that report. Since then, no reports on either the isolation of the enzymes or the identification of the genes involved in the biosynthesis of dTDP-6-deoxy-l-talose have been published. We recently cloned and characterized gene clusters involved in the synthesis of serotype-specific polysaccharide from A. actinomycetemcomitans strain Y4 (serotype b) (10.Yoshida Y. Nakano Y. Yamashita Y. Koga T. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 107-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and strain NCTC 9710 (serotype c) (Fig. 1) (11.Nakano Y. Yoshida Y. Yamashita Y. Koga T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1442: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). dTDP-l-rhamnose biosynthetic genes in the gene cluster from strain Y4 were identified as rmlA, rmlB,rmlC, and rmlD; they coded for glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase, dTDP-d-glucose-4,6-dehydratase, dTDP-6-deoxy-d-xylo-4-hexulose-3,5-epimerase, and dTDP-6-deoxy-l-lyxo-4-hexulose reductase, respectively (10.Yoshida Y. Nakano Y. Yamashita Y. Koga T. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 107-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Yoshida Y. Nakano Y. Nezu T. Yamashita Y. Koga T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16933-16939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Four genes corresponding to these rmlgenes were also found in the gene cluster from strain NCTC 9710 (11.Nakano Y. Yoshida Y. Yamashita Y. Koga T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1442: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In comparing these two sets of rml genes, the amino acid sequences of the dTDP-6-deoxy-l-lyxo-4-hexulose reductases shared only 58% identity, although the glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferases, dTDP-d-glucose-4,6-dehydratases, and dTDP-6-deoxy-d-xylo-4-hexulose-3,5-epimerases exhibited more than 95% identities. We predicted that thermlD homologue coded for dTDP-6-deoxy-l-lyxo-4-hexulose reductase, which catalyzes the production of dTDP-6-deoxy-l-talose, because the stereoselectivity of the reduction determines the direction of synthesis of these two 6-deoxyhexoses. In this study, we report that, contrary to that expectation, one of three serotype c-specific genes (ORF7, ORF8, and ORF9) was identified as the tll gene coding for dTDP-6-deoxy-l-lyxo-4-hexulose reductase, which forms dTDP-6-deoxy-l-talose. This gene was subcloned into the vector pMAL, and the gene product was purified and characterized. E. coliDH5α (supE44 ΔlacU169 (φ80lacZΔM15) hsdR17 recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 relA1) (13.Sambrook J.

E. coli ER2566 (F−λ− fhuA2 (lon) ompT lacZ::T7 gene1 gal sulA11Δ(mcrC-mrr)144::IS10 R(mcr-73:: miniTn10-TetS)2 R(zgb-210::Tn10)(TetS) endA1 (dcm)) was used as a host strain for pTYB vectors (New England Biolabs). E. coli BL21 (E. coli B F− dcm ompT hsdS(rB−mB−)gal) was used as a host strain for pGEX-6P derivatives (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).E. coli strains were grown aerobically in 2 × TY broth at 37 °C (13.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Ampicillin and chloramphenicol were used at final concentrations of 50 μg/ml and 20 μg/ml, respectively. DNA fragment preparation, agarose gel electrophoresis, DNA labeling, ligation, and bacterial transformation were performed using the methods described by Sambrook et al. (13.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). PCR amplification was performed using a GeneAmp PCR System 2400 from Perkin-Elmer. Sequencing was performed using an ABI 373 DNA sequencing apparatus (Perkin-Elmer). Oligonucleotide primers for the amplification of rmlA, rmlB, rmlC,rmlD, and tll from A. actinomycetemcomitans NCTC 9710 chromosomal DNA andrmlD from A. actinomycetemcomitans Y4 chromosomal DNA were designed to introduce appropriate restriction sites for cloning. To construct plasmids for gene expression and protein purification, the following sets of primers were used for amplification: for the rmlA gene, 5′-AACATATGAAGGGTATTATTCTTGC-3′ and 5′-AACCCGGGTCCAGTTTCCTTAATTATTCT-3′; for the rmlB gene, 5′-AACATATGTTGAAAACTATTTTAGTTAC-3′ and 5′-AACCCGGGTTGACTGCCTAAACGCTCA-3′; for the rmlC gene, 5′-AACATATGAAAGTATTGATACTAA-3′ and 5′-AACCCGGGTTTAAAAGTGACCGCATCT-3′; for the rmlD (NCTC 9710) gene, 5′-ATATCCCGGGGGCGAGACTCCTTATAACGGGAGCT-3′ and 5′-ATATCTCGAGTTACTCCGCATACGCTCTAAT-3′; for the tll gene, 5′-CTCTGGATCCAATATAATTATAACTGGAGC-3′ and 5′-CTCTCTGCAGTTATTTTGCTCCCCACA-3′; for the rmlD (Y4) gene, 5′-ATGCATATGGCAAAATTTCTGATT-3′ and 5′-GGGCCCGGGCTCCGCATACGCTTTAAT-3′. A fusion of rmlA, rmlB, and rmlCfrom strain NCTC 9710 and rmlD from strain Y4 with the gene coding for intein-chitin binding domain were constructed using the vector pTYB2. The amplified genes were subsequently digested with restriction enzymes NdeI and SmaI and ligated into pTYB2, which had been cleaved with the same enzymes. Fusion oftll from strain NCTC 9710 with malE was constructed using the vector pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs). Fusion ofrmlD from strain NCTC 9710 with the glutathioneS-transferase gene was constructed using the vector pGEX-6P (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To purify the fusion proteins produced by pTYB derivatives, 200-ml cultures of E. coli harboring the expression plasmids were grown at 30 °C to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.7. IPTG was added to a final concentration of 1.0 mm, and cultures were incubated for an additional 4 h at 30 °C. After disruption of the cells by ultrasonication, cell extracts were obtained by centrifugation at 12,000 × gfor 30 min at 4 °C. Binding of the fusion proteins to chitin beads via intein-chitin binding domain (New England Biolabs), cleavage of the fusion proteins (in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 30 mmdithiothreitol at 4 °C), and elution of each product were all done according to the manufacturer's instructions. Induction of MalE-Tll production with IPTG, purification of the fusion protein on amylose columns, and its cleavage with Factor Xa were done essentially as described by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). Production of the RmlD (NCTC 9710)-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was induced by IPTG and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. Glycerol was added to the purified proteins to a final concentration of 50%, and they were stored at −20 °C. The purity of the proteins was checked by SDS-PAGE (4% stacking gels and 12.5% separating gels). The reaction mixture, containing 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 12 mm MgCl2, 4 mmα-d-glucose 1-phosphate, 4 mm dTTP, 0.45 unit of inorganic pyrophosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and appropriate amounts of the purified rmlA gene product, glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase, was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Conversion of α-d-glucose 1-phosphate to dTDP-d-glucose was detected by reversed-phase HPLC and then the rmlB gene product, dTDP-d-glucose-4,6-dehydratase, was added to the reaction mixture. After analysis of conversion of dTDP-d-glucose to dTDP-6-deoxy-d-xylo-4-hexulose, NADPH (8 mm), the rmlC gene product (dTDP-6-deoxy-d-xylo-4-hexulose-3,5-epimerase), and the rmlD gene product (dTDP-6-deoxy-l-lyxo-4-hexulose reductase, which produces dTDP-l-rhamnose) were added to the reaction mixture for the detection of dTDP-l-rhamnose synthesis. To detect synthesis of dTDP-6-deoxy-l-talose, NADH (8 mm), the rmlC gene product, and thetll gene product were added to the reaction mixture. Each reaction was analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC. Conversion of sugar nucleotides was confirmed using reversed-phase HPLC as described by Tonetti et al. (14.Tonetti M. Sturla L. Bisso A. Benatti U. De Flora A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27274-27279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Samples (10 μl) diluted 10-fold with distilled water were injected onto a TSKgel ODS-80Ts column (0.46 × 15 cm; Tosoh) with 0.5m KH2PO4 as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at 40 °C. The eluate was monitored with a UV detector at 260 nm. Approximately 2 mg of sugar nucleotides were pooled from several HPLC runs on an ODS-80Ts. The fraction at each run was immediately cooled on ice, and 4 volumes of cold ethanol was added to the solution to avoid degradation of dTDP-6-deoxy-l-talose in 0.5 mKH2PO4 at room temperature. After removing the excess phosphate by adding ethanol, the solution was concentrated by evaporation and lyophilized. The samples were dissolved in D2O and used for NMR analysis. The NMR analysis was performed within 2 days after purification of the dTDP-hexose, and the sample was stored at −30 °C. 1H NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker AM400 spectrometer. The measurement was made at 298 K. The chemical shifts were referenced to 3-(trimethylsilyl)propanesulfonic acid at 0.0 ppm. The 1H spectra of 128 scans were recorded with presaturation of HOD resonance at 4.72 ppm. Two-dimensional COSY measurement was performed for signal assignments. dTDP-6-deoxy-l-talose and dTDP-l-rhamnose samples were obtained by the same method as described in Ref. 12.Yoshida Y. Nakano Y. Nezu T. Yamashita Y. Koga T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16933-16939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar. About 2 mg of dTDP-6-deoxy-l-talose or dTDP-l-rhamnose was dissolved in 300 μl of 0.1m HCl. Ampoules containing the solutions were sealed under vacuum and heated at 80 °C for 1 h to hydrolyze the dTDP-sugars; the water and HCl were then evaporated. The pellets were converted into the corresponding d-(+)-2-octyl glycoside acetate by the method of Leontein et al. (15.Leontein K. Lindberg B. Lönngren J. Carbohydr. Res. 1978; 62: 359-362Crossref Scopus (785) Google Scholar). Each product was characterized by gas-liquid chromatography (model GC-14B; Shimadzu Works) with a fused silica capillary column (CP Sil-88, 0.25 mm × 50 m; Chrompack Inc.) at 200 °C. Approximately 1 μl of the sample was injected, and the split ratio was 1:20. Helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 0.9 ml/min. To characterize the function of theA. actinomycetemcomitans NCTC 9710 rmlA,rmlB, rmlC, rmlD, and tlland strain Y4 rmlD genes, their protein products were purified to near homogeneity by affinity chromatography (Fig.2) as described in detail under “Experimental Procedures.” The molecular masses of the denatured polypeptides, determined by SDS-PAGE, of 32.3, 40.0, 20.6, 32.4, 31.9, and 30.7 kDa are in close agreement with the predicted molecular weights of the rmlA, rmlB, rmlC,rmlD (NCTC 9710), rmlD (Y4), and tllgene products, respectively. Conversion of d-glucose 1-phosphate and dTTP to dTDP-sugars was detected by reversed-phase HPLC (Fig. 3). The elution profile of the reaction mixture containing dTTP, d-glucose 1-phosphate, and the gene product of the rmlA homologue from A. actinomycetemcomitans NCTC 9710 (Fig. 3 B) and that of the reaction mixture containing dTTP, d-glucose 1-phosphate, and the gene products of the rmlA andrmlB homologues (Fig. 3 C) are shown. These elution profiles were in agreement with those of the mixtures reacted with the rmlA and rmlB gene products (glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase and dTDP-d-glucose-4,6-dehydratase, respectively) from strain Y4 instead of the corresponding gene products from strain NCTC 9710 (data not shown). Considering these results in combination with high homologies of their amino acid sequences, we decided to use the products of the rmlA and rmlB homologues from strain NCTC 9710 as glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase and dTDP-d-glucose-4,6-dehydratase, respectively, in further investigations. Addition of either the rmlC, rmlD(Y4), rmlD (NCTC 9710), or tll gene product to the reaction mixture containing d-glucose 1-phosphate, dTTP, and the rmlA and rmlB products did not change its elution profile (data not shown). These results agree with the report that the dTDP-6-deoxy-l-lyxo-4-hexulose intermediate is not released from dTDP-6-deoxy-d-xylo-4-hexulose-3,5-epimerase in the dTDP-l-rhamnose biosynthetic pathway in E. coli (16.Melo A. Glaser L. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1475-1478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rmlD (Y4) product converted dTDP-6-deoxy-d-xylo-4-hexulose to dTDP-l-rhamnose in conjunction with the rmlC(NCTC 9710) product (Fig. 3 D). When the gene product of thermlD homologue from strain NCTC 9710 was added to the reaction mixture instead of the strain Y4 rmlD product, the elution profile exhibited the same pattern as that of the reaction mixture containing the strain Y4 rmlD product (Fig. 3,D and E). This result also suggests that thermlA, rmlB, and rmlC genes from strain NCTC 9710 code for glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase, dTDP-d-glucose-4,6-dehydratase, and dTDP-6-deoxy-d-xylo-4-hexulose-3,5-epimerase, respectively. The elution profile of a reaction mixture containingd-glucose 1-phosphate, dTTP, NADPH, the rmlABCproducts, and the tll product exhibited only one peak, and its retention time agreed with that of authentic NADP (data not shown). When NADH instead of NADPH was added to the reaction mixture, two major peaks were observed and the retention time of the second peak (26.5 min) was in agreement with that of authentic NAD (Fig. 3 F). The peaks of putative dTDP-l-rhamnose and dTDP-6-deoxy-l-talose were collected and analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography and NMR. The d-(+)-2-octyl glycoside acetates derived from the sugar components of the dTDP-sugars were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography (Fig. 4). The peaks of the dTDP-sugar derivatives produced by the putative dTDP-l-rhamnose-producing dTDP-6-deoxy-l-lyxo-4-hexulose reductases forming from strain Y4 and NCTC 9710 were in agreement with that of authentic l-rhamnose (Fig. 4, A, B, and C). Because authentic 6-deoxytalose is not commercially available, hydrolysates of serotype-specific polysaccharides purified from strain NCTC 9710 (serotype c) and ATCC 29523 (serotype a) were used as standards for 6-deoxy-l-talose and 6-deoxy-d-talose, respectively (2.Shibuya N. Amano K. Azuma J. Nishihara T. Kitamura Y. Noguchi T. Koga T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16318-16323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), (Fig. 4, Dand F). The profile of a derivative of the dTDP-sugar synthesized by the tll gene product was in agreement with that of 6-deoxy-l-talose, a hydrolysate of serotype c-specific polysaccharide (Fig. 4 E). Approximately 2 mg of dTDP-6-deoxy-l-talose and dTDP-l-rhamnose were pooled from several HPLC runs on an ODS-80Ts (Fig. 3, D andF). After removing the excess phosphate by adding ethanol, the solution was concentrated by evaporation. The concentrated solutions were lyophilized and dissolved in D2O. The NMR spectrum of authentic l-rhamnose was also measured (data not shown). The NMR spectra of authentic dTDP and these dTDP-hexoses are shown in Fig. 5. Assignment of these resonances was verified by two-dimensional homonuclear 1H COSY experiments (Fig. 6). Assigned chemical shifts and coupling constants are summarized in TableI. Signals for the nucleotide moieties in the dTDP-sugars were in good agreement with those of dTDP. Signals for the sugar moiety of dTDP-l-rhamnose were in good agreement with the reported chemical shift values of β-l-rhamnose (17.De Bruyn A. Anteunis M. Carbohydr. Res. 1976; 47: 158-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) except for H1′′. The large downfield shift (0.35 ppm) of the H1′′ signal can be attributed to neighboring phosphate groups, which also affect the H2′′ signal, thereby causing the poor resolution. The signal of H3′ is rather small, perhaps because it is affected by decoupling of water nearby. The coupling constants also supported the orientations of H2′′, H3′′, H4′′, and H5′′ being equatorial, axial, axial, and axial, respectively, except for theJ 1,2 value of 8.80 Hz. This value is inconsistent with the chemical shift values indicating the β configuration, and it is reasonable to think that the neighboring phosphate groups also affect the coupling constant. Because 6-deoxy-l-talose is not commercially available, the values of chemical shifts and coupling constants were compared with those of dTDP-l-rhamnose. The chemical shifts were in good agreement with those of dTDP-l-rhamnose except for H3′′, H4′′, and H5′′. In addition, the J 3,4 andJ 4,5 values were small coupling constants in contrast to the dTDP-l-rhamnose values. These results also support this sugar nucleotide being dTDP-6-deoxy-l-talose.Figure 6COSY spectra of dTDP-6-deoxy-l-talose converted from dTTP andd-glucose 1-phosphate by the rmlA,rmlB, rmlC, and tllgene products in D2O at 298 K (A) and its expansion (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table INMR spectroscopic identification of dTDP, dTDP-l-rhamnose, and dTDP-6-deoxy-l-taloseProtondTDPdTDP-l-rhamnosedTDP-6-deoxy-l-taloseChemical shiftChemical shiftCoupling constantChemical shiftCoupling constantδ (ppm)δ (ppm)Hzδ (ppm)HzH-37.80(s)as, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; dd, double doublet; m, multiplet.7.78(s)7.81(s)H-67.77(s)7.74(s)7.76(s)CH31.95(s)1.91(d)1.93(d)H-1′6.37(t)6.34(t)6.37(t)H-2′2.38(dd)2.35(dd)2.38(dd)H-3′4.65(m)4.61(dd)4.64(dd)H-4′4.19(d*)b* indicates the signal is broad and weakly coupling with H-5′.4.16(d*)4.19(d*)H-5′4.00(m)4.01(m)4.00(m)H-1“5.21(d)J 1,28.805.17(d)J 1,2 8.76H-2“4.08(d)J 2,32.924.06(d)J 2,3 2.44H-3“3.63(dd)J 3,49.763.82(dd)J 3,4 2.92H-4“3.36(dd)J 4,59.283.65(dd)J 4,5 5.88H-5“3.43(m)3.75(m)H-6“1.30(d)1.31(d)a s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; dd, double doublet; m, multiplet.b * indicates the signal is broad and weakly coupling with H-5′. Open table in a new tab We have previously cloned the gene cluster essential for the biosynthesis of serotype b-specific polysaccharide antigen fromA. actinomycetemcomitans Y4 and identified the four genes coding for the enzymes that synthesize dTDP-l-rhamnose fromd-glucose 1-phosphate, dTTP, and NADPH (10.Yoshida Y.

The genes coding for glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase, dTDP-d-glucose-4,6-dehydratase, dTDP-6-deoxy-d-xylo-4-hexulose-3,5-epimerase, and dTDP-6-deoxy-l-lyxo-4-hexulose reductase are designated as rmlA, rmlB, rmlC, andrmlD, respectively (18.Reeves P. Hobbs M. Valvano A. Skurnik M. Whitfield C. Coplin D. Kido N. Klena J. Maskell D. Raetz C.R.H. Rick P.D. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 495-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The gene cluster essential for the biosynthesis of serotype c-specific polysaccharide antigen, 6-deoxy-l-talan, was also cloned from A. actinomycetemcomitans NCTC 9710; four genes whose products exhibited high homology to the rmlA, rmlB,rmlC, and rmlD gene products were found (11.Nakano Y. Yoshida Y. Yamashita Y. Koga T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1442: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase, dTDP-d-glucose-4,6-dehydratase, and dTDP-6-deoxy-d-xylo-4-hexulose-3,5-epimerase of strain Y4 show more than 90% identity with their strain NCTC 9710 homologues, whereas strain Y4 dTDP-6-deoxy-l-lyxo-4-hexulose reductase shares only 58% identity with its corresponding gene product in strain NCTC 9710. We expected the rmlD homologue of strain NCTC 9710 to be the gene coding for dTDP-6-deoxy-l-lyxo-4-hexulose reductase, which synthesizes dTDP-6-deoxy-l-talose. We expected this because both dTDP-6-deoxy-l-talose and dTDP-l-rhamnose are predicted to be synthesized from dTDP-6-deoxy-l-lyxo-4-hexulose by reduction, and the stereoselectivity of the reduction determines the direction of synthesis of these compounds to dTDP-6-deoxyhexoses (11.Nakano Y. Yoshida Y. Yamashita Y. Koga T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1442: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Contrary to our expectations, the gene product of the rmlD homologue of strain NCTC 9710 converted dTDP-6-deoxy-l-lyxo-4-hexulose to dTDP-l-rhamnose (Fig. 3 E). In comparing the strain NCTC 9710 cluster essential for 6-deoxy-l-talan synthesis with the gene cluster producing serotype b-specific polysaccharide antigen, it was found that ORF7, ORF8, and ORF9 (Fig. 1) were specific to the former cluster. The amino acid sequence of ORF8 product exhibited weak identity (22.6%) withE. coli UDP-glucose-4-epimerases and a GXXGXXG motif of a NAD-binding domain is present at the N terminus of the ORF8 product (19.Macpherson D.F. Manning P.A. Morona R. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). UDP-glucose-4-epimerase catalyzes both the conversion of UDP-galactose to UDP-glucose and the reverse reaction; the target of the reaction is the C-4 position of the nucleotide-activated hexoses. l-Rhamnose and 6-deoxy-l-talose differ in the stereochemistry of the C-4 carbon. As serotype c-specific polysaccharide antigen does not containl-rhamnose, we expected that dTDP-l-rhamnose would serve as a precursor for the synthesis of dTDP-6-deoxy-l-talose and that the ORF8 product would be dTDP-l-rhamnose-4-epimerase for the conversion of dTDP-l-rhamnose to dTDP-6-deoxy-l-talose. Again contrary to our expectations, the ORF8 product did not convert dTDP-l-rhamnose to dTDP-6-deoxy-l-talose (data not shown), but dTDP-6-deoxy-l-lyxo-4-hexulose to dTDP-6-deoxy-l-talose (Fig. 3 F). NMR and gas-liquid chromatography analyses also showed that the product of the reaction was dTDP-6-deoxy-l-talose and corresponded to the component of serotype c-specific polysaccharide antigen (Figs. 4 and5). This gene product was therefore identified as a dTDP-6-deoxy-l-lyxo-4-hexulose reductase for synthesizing dTDP-6-deoxy-l-talose, and the gene was designated tll. In fact, the formation of dTDP-6-deoxy-l-talose by the enzymatic activity of dTDP-6-deoxy-l-lyxo-4-hexulose reductase was detected in E. coli O45 27 years ago, but no characterization of the enzyme has since been reported (9.Gaugler R.W. Gabriel O. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6041-6049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bacterial cell surface polysaccharides consisting solely of 6-deoxy-l-talose are rare, although this hexose has been found as a component of some bacterial polysaccharides (5.Jann B. Shashkov A. Torgov V. Kochanowski H. Seltmann G. Jann K. Carbohydr. Res. 1995; 278: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 6.Zähringer U. Rettenmaier H. Moll H. Senchenkova S.N. Knirel Y.A.

Microbiol. 1995; 163: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The type II O-antigenic polysaccharide of Burkholderia pseudomalleilipopolysaccharide contains 6-deoxy-l-talose and the cluster of 15 genes required for its production has been identified and sequenced (20.DeShazer D. Brett P.J. Woods D.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 1081-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The rml genes were also found in this gene cluster, although the B. pseudomallei lipopolysaccharide does not contain l-rhamnose. Three genes, wbiB,wbiG, and wbiI, were viewed as candidates for nucleotide sugar epimerases involved in the conversion of dTDP-l-rhamnose to dTDP-6-deoxy-l-talose. None of these gene products shares homology with the tll gene product except for the consensus NAD-binding domains (GXXGXXG). In B. pseudomallei, dTDP-l-rhamnose may be a precursor of dTDP-6-deoxy-l-talose. dTDP-6-deoxy-l-talose-forming dTDP-6-deoxy-l-lyxo-4-hexulose reductase shares the common substrate dTDP-6-deoxy-l-lyxo-4-hexulose with that forming dTDP-l-rhamnose, their only difference is stereoselectivity of the products. Nonetheless, they exhibited a very low degree (20.6%) of homology in their amino acid sequences (Fig.7). A. actinomycetemcomitansY4 dTDP-6-deoxy-d-xylo-4-hexulose reductase, responsible for forming dTDP-d-fucose, is also a dTDP-6-deoxy-4-hexulose reductase (12.Yoshida Y. Nakano Y. Nezu T. Yamashita Y. Koga T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16933-16939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of this reductase and that of dTDP-6-deoxy-l-talose-synthesizing dTDP-6-deoxy-l-lyxo-4-hexulose reductase show very low (15.3%) homology. It seems unsurprising that the homologies among the dTDP-6-deoxy-4-hexulose reductases are very low when compared with analogous enzymes of other organisms. CDP-abequose synthase, encoded by the abe gene in Salmonella entericaLT2 serover Typhimurium, converts CDP-3,6-dideoxy-d-erythro-4-hexulose to CDP-3,6-dideoxy-d-galactose, CDP-abequose (21.Verma N. Reeves P. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5694-5701Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). CDP-paratose synthase, encoded by the per gene in S. enterica TY2, converts the same sugar nucleotide to CDP-3,6-dideoxy-d-glucose, CDP-paratose (22.Wyk P. Reeves P. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5687-5693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These two CDP-3,6-dideoxy-d-erythro-4-hexulose reductases share the common substrate, and their only difference is stereoselectivity of the products, analogous to the reactions of dTDP-6-deoxy-l-lyxo-4-hexulose reductases. These two reductases exhibit 25.9% amino acid sequence identity. The identity between dTDP-6-deoxy-l-talose-forming dTDP-6-deoxy-l-lyxo-4-hexulose reductase and CDP-3,6-dideoxy-d-erythro-4-hexulose reductases are around 19%. It seems reasonable that the homology between the enzymes that share the same substrate is higher than that between the enzyme whose substrates are different. dTDP-6-deoxy-l-talose was reported as an unusual sugar (9.Gaugler R.W. Gabriel O. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6041-6049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The stability of this sugar nucleotide is quite different from others; for example exposure to mild alkaline conditions results in quantitative degradation to dTMP and dTDP-6-deoxy-l-talose 1,2-phosphate. When conversion of d-glucose 1-phosphate and dTTP to dTDP-6-deoxy-l-talose was carried out in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.6, the peak of this sugar nucleotide disappeared in the elution profile of reversed-phase HPLC (data not shown). Furthermore, when the fraction of dTDP-6-deoxy-l-talose eluted from ODS-80Ts was again analyzed using the same column after it was left at room temperature overnight, another peak in addition to dTDP-6-deoxy-l-talose and NAD appeared at around 13 min (data not shown). Such instability has not been observed during the purification and characterization of dTDP-l-rhamnose and dTDP-d-fucose. In conclusion, we have identified two dTDP-6-deoxy-l-lyxo-4-hexulose reductases that synthesize dTDP-6-deoxy-l-talose and dTDP-l-rhamnose in A. actinomycetemcomitans NCTC 9710 (serotype c). Combined with the earlier demonstration in A. actinomycetemcomitans Y4 (serotype b) of dTDP-6-deoxy-d-xylo-4-hexulose reductase-forming dTDP-d-fucose, a biosynthetic pathway of unique dTDP-6-deoxyhexoses not previously found in other organisms was elucidated (Fig. 8)."
https://openalex.org/W2079908766,"An interleukin-2 (IL-2) variant containing adjacent point mutations (L18M/L19S, termed 2D1) displaying binding affinity to the heterotrimeric IL-2 receptor similar to that of wild-type IL-2 (WT) had been previously found to surprisingly exhibit increased bioactivity in a peripheral blood lymphocyte proliferation assay. In order to provide an explanatory mechanism for this unexpected potency enhancement, we hypothesize that altered endocytic trafficking of the 2D1 variant might be responsible by increasing the number of ligand-receptor complexes. We demonstrate here that the internalization kinetics of 2D1 via the high affinity IL-2 receptor are equivalent to those of WT but that a significantly increased fraction of internalized 2D1 is sorted to recycling instead of to lysosomal degradation. We further find a reduced pH sensitivity of binding to IL-2 receptor α relative to IL-2 receptor β compared with WT, which could be responsible for the altered sorting behavior of 2D1 in the acidic endosomal compartment. Accordingly, the 2D1 variant displays a half-life 36 h longer than that of IL-2 in T-lymphocyte culture at concentrations equal to the K D of the IL-2 receptor. The extended half-life of intact 2D1 provides enhanced mitogenesis as compared with IL-2. In addition, 2D1 stimulates natural killer cells to a lesser degree than IL-2 at equal concentrations. We conclude that this IL-2 variant provides increased mitogenic stimulation that could not be easily predicted from its cell surface receptor binding affinity while minimizing undesired stimulation of natural killer cells. This concept of altering trafficking dynamics may offer a generalizable approach to generating improvements in the pharmacological efficacy of therapeutic cytokines.

Guidebook to Cytokines and Their Receptors. Oxford University Press, New York1994Google Scholar). Cytokines direct communication among cells of the hematopoietic system by binding to specific cell surface receptors (2.Paul W.E. Seder R.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 241-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar). These receptors generally bind their soluble ligands with very high affinity; thus, optimum response requires delivery of cytokines to target cells at very low concentrations (∼10−10–10−12m). These low levels are difficult to sustain due to rapid systemic clearance. Endocytosis of cytokines via their cognate receptors provides cells with an efficient means of modulating their response to ligand-receptor binding events (3.Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). This down-regulatory mechanism can cause significant depletion of therapeutic cytokines, however, creating the need to deliver unphysiologically high doses in order to maintain reasonable in vivo concentrations (4.Metcalf D.

Clinical studies using IL-2 in the treatment of AIDS have been encouraging, due to its critical role as a proliferative signal for activated T-lymphocytes (10.Khatri V.P. Fehniger T.A.

IL-2 has also undergone trials in the treatment of several types of cancer, based on its stimulation of cytotoxic, antitumor cells (15.Noble S. Goa K.L.

Toxicity has severely limited the effectiveness of IL-2 treatments, however, making cell receptor-level pharmacodynamic issues crucial in expanding its therapeutic applicability (19.Anderson P.M. Sorenson M.A. Clin. Pharmacokinet. 1994; 27: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 20.Smith K.A. Blood. 1993; 81: 1414-1423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pharmacokinetics can be addressed on both a systemic level and at the site of IL-2 activity, the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) expressed in various forms on hematopoietic cells (21.Smith K.A. Cancer J. Sci. Am. 1997; 3: S137-S140PubMed Google Scholar). Cell-level pharmacokinetics involves consideration of receptor-mediated endocytic turnover and intracellular degradation of internalized cytokine molecules that, over time, leads to depletion of ligand from the extracellular medium (22.Lauffenburger D.A. Fallon E.M. Haugh J.M. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: R257-R263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The IL-2 receptor on activated T-lymphocytes consists of α, β, and γ subunits, the latter two of which have been shown to mediate IL-2-induced proliferative signaling in these cells (23.Nakamura Y. Russell S.M. Mess S.A. Friedmann M. Erdos M. Francois C. Jacques Y. Adelstein S. Leonard W.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 330-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 24.Nelson B.H. Lord J.D. Greenberg P.D. Nature. 1994; 369: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Expression of the α subunit is up-regulated by T cells upon antigen activation and is thus found in ∼100-fold excess on the surface of activated T cell populations (8.Theze J. Alzari P.M. Bertoglio J. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 481-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The α subunit serves solely to enhance the affinity of the IL-2R complex for soluble IL-2 (25.Gutgsell N.S. Malek T.R. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3899-3907PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Forsten K.E.

Sabe H. Teshigawara K. Maeda M. Uchiyama T. Yodoi J. Honjo T. Nature. 1984; 311: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). This heterotrimeric receptor binds with high affinity to IL-2 (K D = 10 pm), followed by rapid internalization and specific degradation of both IL-2 and the β and γ subunits (28.Subtil A.

Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Consistent with its role as a signaling-deficient enhancer of cell surface ligand binding affinity, the α subunit is constitutively recycled following postendocytic sorting (31.Hemar A. Subtil A.

Therefore, receptor-ligand trafficking dynamics should influence the potency of IL-2 to at least as significant a degree as receptor binding affinity, as has been illustrated in the epidermal growth factor ligand-receptor system (32.Reddy C.C. Wells A. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 512-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 33.Reddy C.C. Wells A. Lauffenburger D.A. Biotechnol. Prog. 1994; 10: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The functional β and γ IL-2 receptor subunits are also constitutively expressed on natural killer (NK) cells, thus allowing this cell type to respond to IL-2 through up-regulation of cytokine secretion and enhancement of cytotoxicity (34.Kornbluth J. Hoover R.G. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 3234-3240PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Handa K. Suzuki R. Matsui H. Shimizu Y. Kumagai K. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 988-992PubMed Google Scholar). IL-2 therapies have been hampered by a therapeutic “window” in concentration, defined at the upper end by undesired stimulation of intermediate affinity (K D ≈ 0.1–10 nm) βγ IL-2 receptors on NK cells, and at the lower end by desired stimulation of high affinity (K D ≈ 1–100 pm) αβγ IL-2 receptors on antigen-activated T and B cells (14.Jacobson E.L. Pilaro F. Smith K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10405-10410Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 20.Smith K.A. Blood. 1993; 81: 1414-1423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dangerous inflammatory responses are activated at the upper end of IL-2 concentration, whereas therapeutic effects are not observed below the lower end. We demonstrate that a double mutant of IL-2, L18M/L19S (termed 2D1) displays reduced endocytic degradation when compared with wild-type IL-2 (WT) and that this effect is due to enhanced ligand recycling. Analysis of ligand binding to the IL-2R α and β subunits at cell surface and endosomal pH indicates that the affinity of 2D1 for IL-2Rα decreases to a lesser degree than that of WT as ligand-receptor complexes undergo sorting. These intracellular trafficking differences permit greater sustenance of 2D1 concentrations in cell culture, and increased T-lymphocyte proliferation. The reduced binding affinity of 2D1 to the βγ IL-2R on NK cells also provides reduced stimulation of these cells, a desired outcome in an in vivo setting. This suggests that IL-2 mutants engineered for improved cellular pharmacokinetics and optimal binding affinities to cell type-specific IL-2 receptor isoforms can provide enhanced mitogenic response of T-lymphocytes while minimizing potential in vivo toxicity. RPMI 1640 medium, l-glutamine, and Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Fetal bovine serum was obtained from Intergen (Purchase, NY). Solution for the Coulter counter (ISOTON II, Coulter Diagnostics, Hialeah, FL) was acquired from Curtin Matheson Scientific Inc. (Houston, TX). 125I was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Wild-type IL-2 and 2D1 (L18M/L19S) were previously prepared via cassette mutagenesis on a synthetic IL-2 gene (36.Williams D.P. Regier D. Akiyoshi D. Genbauffer F. Murphy J.R.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6571-6577Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Proteins were expressed in E. coli, refolded, and purified as described previously (38.Landgraf B.E. Williams D.P. Murphy J.R., K.A., S. Ciardelli T.L. Proteins. 1991; 9: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Concentrations of purified proteins were determined by UV absorption (ε280 = 9.53 × 103m−1) (39.Johnson Jr., W.D. Proteins. 1990; 7: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Radioiodinated IL-2 and 2D1 were prepared using the indirect IODO-GEN method according to the manufacturer's protocol (Pierce). Specific activities were determined by CTLL bioassay (40.Gillis S. Ferm M.M. Ou W. Smith K.A. J. Immunol. 1978; 121: 2027-2032Google Scholar) and ranged from 2 to 4 Ci/μmol. The KIT-225 human IL-2-dependent cell line, originally derived from a T-lymphocytic leukemia patient, expresses roughly 3000 high affinity IL-2 receptors (IL-2Rαβγ,K D = 10 pm) and 300,000 low affinity sites (IL-2Rα, K D = 10 nm) (41.Hori T.

Uchiyama T. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1265-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The YT-2C2 human leukemic NK cell line expresses approximately 20,000 intermediate affinity IL-2 receptors (IL-2Rβγ,K D = 1 nm) (43.Teshigawara K. Wang H.-M. Kato K. Smith K.A. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 223-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). KIT-225 cells were routinely cultured in Corning 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 1 nm IL-2, 200 mml-glutamine, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. YT-2C2 cells were cultured in the same medium without IL-2. All cells were passaged to 105 cells/ml every 2–3 days. Internalization experiments were performed in a 96-well format using the MultiScreen Assay System (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The bottom of each well in a MultiScreen microtiter plate consists of a low protein binding, semipermeable (0.65 μm pore size) membrane that provides separation of cell-associated ligand and free protein upon vacuum filtration of the plate base. KIT-225 cells were washed three times with supplemented RPMI 1640 medium to remove exogenous IL-2 and were resuspended at 4 × 106 cells/ml. 100 μl of the cell suspension was loaded into each well, and cells were exposed to a range of labeled ligand concentrations (1–200 pm) for 0–30 min at 37 °C to allow receptor-mediated endocytosis to occur. Following ligand exposure, free protein was suctioned through the base of the plate, and wells were washed six times with 250 μl of ice-cold PBS. Half of the plate was then exposed to three 250-μl rinses of acid strip containing urea (10 mm citrate, 0.14m NaCl, 50 μg/ml BSA, and 2 m urea, pH 2.8) for 3 min each to remove cell surface-bound ligand. Strip efficiency was determined to be ∼90% in control experiments. The remaining half of the plate was simultaneously rinsed with PBS, and membranes were then counted individually by solid scintillation. Stripped wells were considered as internalized counts (Ci) and PBS-rinsed wells as total counts (CT), the difference being cell surface-associated (Cs). Each data point was measured in triplicate, subtracting membrane-bound ligand in the absence of cells. An endocytic rate constant (k e) was calculated for each ligand concentration as the slope of a straight-line fit to a plot of Ci versus ∫ CsΔt, as described (44.Wiley H.S. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4222-4229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). KIT-225 cells were washed three times with supplemented RPMI 1640 medium and resuspended in the same medium including various concentrations of 125I-IL-2 and 125I-2D1 (10–100 pm) at 5 × 106 cells/ml. Cells were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C to allow intracellular sorting processes to reach steady state, as described previously (45.French A.R. Tadaki D.K. Niyogi S.K. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4334-4340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 46.French A.R. Sudlow G.P. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Biol.

Samples were cooled to 4 °C and washed twice with ice-cold PBS, followed by two washes with ice-cold acid strip (10 mm citrate, 0.14 m NaCl, 50 μg/ml BSA, pH 2.8) to remove surface bound 125I-ligand. This strip protocol removed all the cell surface-associated label, as indicated by control experiments in which cells were incubated with radiolabeled ligands for 3 h at 4 °C prior to washing. After an additional wash with ice-cold PBS, cells were resuspended at 37 °C in medium containing 200 nm unlabeled IL-2 to prevent rebinding of released, labeled ligands to cell surface receptors. Aliquots containing 5 × 106 cells were removed to Eppendorf tubes at 0, 5, 10, and 15 min and pelleted. The supernatant was collected, and the cell pellet was rinsed in ice-cold medium and pelleted again. Cell pellets were resuspended in 1 m NaOH and counted by solid scintillation to calculate intracellular ligand concentrations. Supernatants were combined and counted to determine the amount of radioactivity released by the cells. Parallel samples were centrifuged through 10-kDa-molecular mass cutoff filtration units to separate intact from degraded 125I-ligand (Ultrafree-MC, Millipore). Parallel samples passed through Sephadex G-10 columns provided equally reliable results. Surface plasmon resonance analysis of WT and 2D1 binding to immobilized IL-2Rα and IL-2Rβ ectodomains was performed as described (47.Wu Z. Johnson K.W. Choi Y. Ciardelli T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16045-16051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Sensor chip surfaces with oriented IL-2Rα or IL-2Rβ subunits were prepared via thioether linkages at single cysteine residues present in the native extracellular domain (IL-2Rα) or introduced by mutagenesis (IL-2Rβ) (48.Sana T. Wu Z. Smith K. Ciardelli T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5838-5845Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) as described previously (49.Myszka D.G. Arulanantham P.R. Sana T. Wu Z.N. Morton T.A. Ciardelli T.L. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2468-2478Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Surface plasmon resonance instrumentation (BIAcoreTM), CM5 sensor chips, and amine-coupling reagents containing N-hydroxysuccinimide,N-ethyl-N′-(3-diethyl-aminopropyl)carbodiimide, and ethanolamine HCl were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Thiol conjugation was achieved usingm-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Pierce). Purified IL-2Rα or IL-2Rβ complex was diluted into NaOAc buffer (10 mm), pH 5, and coupled to the dextran-modified gold surface of a CM5 sensor chip using the manufacturer's coupling chemistry as described in the BIAcoreTM systems manual. Surface densities of 800–3500 resonance units of IL-2R complex were used. Prior to analysis, stock solutions of WT and 2D1 were dialyzed against phosphate buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2 or pH 6, 150 mm NaCl), and protein concentrations were determined from A 280 values (37.Berndt W.G. Chang D.Z. Smith K.A. Ciardelli T.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6571-6577Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Samples were then diluted to desired concentrations in analysis buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2 or pH 6, 150 mmNaCl, 0.005% surfactant P-20) containing 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Six to eight serial dilutions of each protein were injected over the respective surfaces at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. Sensorgrams were recorded and normalized to a baseline value of 0 RU. Equivalent samples were injected over BSA surfaces for simultaneous subtraction of nonspecific binding and bulk refractive index background. Each determination was performed in triplicate, and the same surface was used for each set of data collected at pH 7.2 and pH 6. Because binding of WT and 2D1 reached a constant equilibrium value during injection on both IL-2R complex surfaces at pH 7.2 and pH 6, this equilibrium value (RUeq) was used to fit the data to a single-site binding isotherm (A + B =AB) at each condition. After subtraction of background and nonspecific RU (determined by injection over a BSA surface), RUeq was plotted versus C, the concentration of ligand injected over the sensor chip surface. The dissociation constants were estimated by weighted, nonlinear least squares curve fitting using KaleidaGraphTM (version 3.09, Synergy Software). KIT-225 cells were passaged into supplemented RPMI 1640 medium (without IL-2) at 2 × 105 cells/ml 6 days prior to the addition of exogenous IL-2 analogs. Cells were switched into fresh IL-2-free medium on day 3 of quiescence. Growth experiments were initiated by switching cells into media containing a range of ligand concentrations (1, 10, and 100 pm). Cells were counted in a Coulter counter to monitor growth. Cell aliquots from equivalent populations were washed in ice-cold medium and resuspended in medium containing 500 pm125I-IL-2 at approximately 2 × 106 cells/ml. Cell suspensions were transferred to 0.65 μm MultiScreen microtiter plates and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C. Following incubation, free protein was suctioned through the base of the plate, and wells were washed six times with 250 μl of ice-cold PBS. Membranes were then counted individually by solid scintillation to determine cell surface-associated radioactivity. Each data point was measured in triplicate, subtracting nonspecific binding as determined by addition of 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled wild-type IL-2. Quiescent KIT-225 cells or YT-2C2 cells were incubated in media containing125I-labeled ligands. Controls for nonspecific degradation included incubation with 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled IL-2. Cell aliquots were removed and pelleted every 12 h, and supernatants were centrifuged through 10-kDa-molecular mass cutoff filtration units to separate intact from degraded 125I-ligand. This method proved to be equivalent to gel filtration in quantifying relative amounts of degraded protein. YT-2C2 cells were incubated for 48 h in medium containing 1 nm IL-2 or 2D1. At that time, the concentration of IFN-γ was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit obtained from Intergen (Purchase, NY). No cross-reactivity of the IFN-γ antibody was observed with either WT or 2D1 under experimental conditions (data not shown). Medium samples were centrifuged to remove cellular debris prior to analysis. A double mutant of IL-2, L18M/L19S (2D1), was shown to yield an equivalent biological response to wild-type at a 2-fold lower concentration (TableI) (37.Berndt W.G. Chang D.Z. Smith K.A. Ciardelli T.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6571-6577Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for this enhanced potency might be increased binding to the high affinity IL-2 receptor (αβγ complex) expressed on activated T-lymphocytes. This would be expected to generate more ligand-receptor complexes at a given cytokine concentration, resulting in up-regulated cell proliferation (50.Smith K.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 766: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The binding affinities of WT and 2D1 to the αβγ complex are roughly equivalent, however, requiring an alternative explanation for the superagonism of 2D1 (TableII) (37.Berndt W.G. Chang D.Z. Smith K.A. Ciardelli T.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6571-6577Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We sought to characterize the trafficking behavior of WT and 2D1 as a potential source of their differences in observed mitogenic potency.Table IMitogenic potencies of IL-2 and 2D1 on human peripheral blood lymphocytesEC50pmWT IL-216.0 ± 2.02D17.6 ± 0.7Concentrations of protein producing 50% of the maximal cell response in 48-h [3H] thymidine uptake bioassays, as described (64.Landgraf B.E.

A different IL-2 variant, T51P, had been previously shown to be deficient in receptor-mediated endocytic uptake, resulting in negligible cellular depletion of ligand from the culture medium. Therefore, despite a reduced receptor binding affinity, T51P generated a proliferative response equivalent to that of WT due to abrogated down-regulation of ligand-receptor complexes from the cell surface (51.Chang D.Z. Wu Z. Ciardelli T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13349-13355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To test whether this mechanism was responsible for the enhanced mitogenic potency of 2D1, we measured the internalization rates of WT and 2D1 on T-lymphocytes. The KIT-225 human cell line was chosen because it is IL-2-dependent, providing the opportunity to correlate receptor-mediated trafficking events and mitogenesis within a single system. Cells were incubated with ligand concentrations both below and above the K D of the high affinity IL-2 receptor (10 pm) to investigate endocytic behavior at potentially subsaturating and saturating conditions (52.Lund K.A. Opresko L.K. Starbuck C. Walsh B.J. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15713-15723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radiolabeled WT and 2D1 were internalized with comparable rates at both low and high surface receptor occupancy (Fig. 1). Over most of the occupancy range, the internalization rate constants fell within the interval of 0.03–0.04 min−1, which corresponds to the internalization half-time of 17–23 min observed in activated peripheral blood lymphocytes (51.Chang D.Z. Wu Z. Ciardelli T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13349-13355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Surface binding and receptor-mediated endocytosis of 2D1 are thus indistinguishable from WT. The increase in the value of the internalization rate constant with increasing receptor occupancy at low concentrations is intriguing and may indicate an interesting regulation point; this phenomenon, however, is beyond the scope of the present work. We therefore hypothesized that altered intracellular sorting might be the traffickin"
https://openalex.org/W1969898731,"Type II topoisomerases, a family of enzymes that govern topological DNA interconversions, are essential to many cellular processes in eukaryotic organisms. Because no data are available about the functions of these enzymes in the replication of viruses that infect eukaryotic hosts, this led us to express and characterize the first topoisomerase II encoded by one of such viruses. <i>Paramecium bursaria chlorella</i> virus 1 (PBCV-1) infects certain chlorella-like green algae and encodes a 120-kDa protein with a similarity to type II topoisomerases. This protein was expressed in<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and was highly active in relaxation of both negatively and positively supercoiled plasmid DNA, catenation of plasmid DNA, and decatenation of kinetoplast DNA networks. Its optimal activity was determined, and the omission of Mg<sup>2+</sup> or its replacement with other divalent cations abolished DNA relaxation. All activities of the recombinant enzyme were ATP dependent. Increasing salt concentrations shifted DNA relaxation from a normally processive mechanism to a distributive mode. Thus, even though the PBCV-1 enzyme is considerably smaller than other eukaryotic topoisomerase II enzymes (whose molecular masses are typically 160–180 kDa), it displays all the catalytic properties expected for a type II topoisomerase."

Its interaction with tubulin modulates microtubule dynamics by destabilization of assembled microtubules or inhibition of their polymerization from free tubulin. The aim of this study was to probe the native structure of stathmin and to delineate its minimal region able to interact with tubulin. Limited proteolysis of stathmin revealed four structured domains within the native protein, corresponding to amino acid sequences 22–81 (I), 95–113 (II), 113–128 (III), and 128–149 (IV), which allows us to propose stathmin folding hypotheses. Furthermore, stathmin proteolytic fragments were mixed to interact with tubulin, and those that retained affinity for tubulin were isolated by size exclusion chromatography and identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The results indicate that, to interact with tubulin, a stathmin fragment must span a minimal core region from residues 42 to 126, which interestingly corresponds to the predicted α-helical “interaction region” of stathmin. In addition, an interacting stathmin fragment must include a short N- or C-terminal extension. The functional significance of these interaction constrains is further validated by tubulin polymerization inhibition assays with fragments designed on the basis of the tubulin binding results.

Previous in vitro studies have shown that depolymerization of microtubules can be explained by stathmin sequestration of free tubulin in a T2S complex (16.Curmi P.A. Andersen S.S.L. Lachkar S.

Carlier M.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10817-10821Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). We also have measured that stathmin alters neither the steady state GTPase activity of microtubules nor the critical concentration, all results consistent with a pure tubulin sequestering activity (26.Jourdain L. Curmi P. Sobel A. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10817-10821Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Howell et al. (27.Howell B. Larsson N. Gullberg M. Cassimeris L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) have proposed that stathmin may be a dual potential protein as follows: part of the N-terminal stathmin region could promote catastrophes, whereas tubulin sequestration could be supported by the rest of the molecule. These authors have proposed that sequestration predominates at low pH (6.8), whereas stathmin promotes catastrophes when rising the pH to 7.5. This duality could extend the properties of stathmin but, at this time, still has to be confirmed.In the present work, we investigated the structural organization of stathmin and the mechanisms by which it interacts with its functional partners, such as tubulin. We therefore first demonstrated the existence and localization of structured domains within the stathmin molecule by means of limited proteolysis. The involvement of these domains in the interaction of stathmin with tubulin was examined by analyzing which of the smallest stathmin fragments can retain the capacity to interact with tubulin. For this study, we used a strategy based on proteolysis of stathmin, followed by sorting out the fragments still able to interact with tubulin using size exclusion chromatography. These polypeptides were then analyzed by Western blotting and identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS),1 taking advantage of the high accuracy and sensitivity of this method (28.Cohen S.L. Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Burley S.K. Chait B.T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1088-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 29.Kriwacki R.W. Wu J. Tennant L. Wright P.E. Siuzdak G. J. Chromatogr. A. 1997; 777: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The functional value of the interaction results was validated by tubulin polymerization inhibition assays performed with three recombinant stathmin fragments constructed on the basis of the tubulin binding results. Altogether, our results reported here give clues for understanding the structural organization of stathmin as well as the mechanism of interaction of stathmin with tubulin. They may lead to the design of molecular tools tailored to mimic or block the microtubule depolymerization activity of stathmin.DISCUSSIONIn order to progress in the understanding of the molecular domain organization of stathmin as well as the stathmin-tubulin interaction and its regulation, we investigated the structural properties of stathmin in solution by means of limited proteolysis, and we proposed an approach to solve the stathmin interaction regions with tubulin.Stathmin Displays Several Structured Domains in SolutionProteolytic cleavage is governed by solvent accessibility and protein flexibility. Proteolytic protection is conferred to regions of the protein that are either buried within a rigid structure or interacting with other parts of the molecule. In contrast, proteolytic sensitivity is localized in regions that are solvent-accessible, unstructured, or flexible (40.Morrice N.A. Carrey E.A. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure. A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1998: 117-149Google Scholar, 41.Fruton J.S. Reich E. Rifkin D.B. Shaw E. Proteases and Biological Control.

Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1847-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 43.Hubbard S.J. Eisenmenger F. Thornton J.M.

Some structural information may thus be deduced from determination of protection against enzyme proteolysis. By using this method, we have found that stathmin displays four structured domains, and we have shown that the cleavage accessibility map fits reasonably with secondary structure prediction given by several methods. Domain I (residues 22–81) is schematically divided in two types of predicted secondary structures as follows: random coil from residues 22 to 45 (domain Ia) and α-helix from residues 45 to 81 (domain Ib). Its resistance to limited proteolysis suggests that its two halves may be folded over each other to confer this self-protection. Another possibility could be that part Ia is compact with no accessible cleavage site between it and part Ib. Interestingly, domain I harbors three of the four stathmin phosphorylation sites, whose phosphorylation status might lead to major changes in stathmin folding. Domains II (residues 95–113) and III (residues 113–126) fit reasonably within the limits of the second predicted α-helical region of stathmin. Domain IV (from residues 128 to 149) has a high content of Lys-C and Glu-C potential cleavage sites. Its resistance toward proteolysis was ascertained by the observation that it behaved as a proteolysis end product isolated by reverse phase HPLC. Furthermore, the limits of this domain are identical to those of the region corresponding to exon V of stathmin (45.Melhem R.F. Zhu X.X. Hailat N. Strahler J.R. Hanash S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17747-17753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which reinforces its individuality.Stathmin Folding HypothesesDelimitation of structured stathmin domains gives a new insight of stathmin folding and helpful data for the construction of stathmin folding models. Fig. 9 presents two stathmin folding hypotheses matching the existence of these domains. We have imagined that stathmin could adopt schematically an extended or a hairpin turn conformation that in both cases agrees with stathmin being an asymmetrically shaped monomer (16.Curmi P.A. Andersen S.S.L. Lachkar S. Gavet O. Karsenti E. Knossow M. Sobel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25029-25036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 39.Schubart U.K. Alago Jr., W. Danoff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11871-11877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the two hypotheses, we propose either that the two halves of domain I are packed over each other or that the first half presents a compact structure similar to that proposed for domain IV. In hypothesis A, domains II and III are presented end to end with domain I, whereas in hypothesis B, domains II and III are bent back toward the α-helix of domain I in an antiparallel fashion. Computer analysis of stathmin sequence revealed the existence of an internal repeated sequence with 40% identity between amino acid residues 48–82 and 99–134 (46.Maucuer A. Doye V. Sobel A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 264: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both regions have a high probability for coiled-coil formation that may be involved in internal interaction as represented in hypothesis B or for stathmin partner recognition. Finally, it is known that phosphorylation may regulate the secondary, tertiary, and even quaternary structure of proteins (47.Johnson L.N. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2274-2282Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 48.Antz C. Bauer T. Kalbacher H. Frank R. Covarrubias M. Kalbitzer H.R. Ruppersberg J.P. Baukrowitz T. Fakler B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus we propose that phosphorylation of domain I may promote localized changes in the folding of this domain, which may modify the stathmin ability to interact with protein partners such as tubulin.A Stathmin Core Extended on Either Its N- or C-side Is Required for Interaction with TubulinIn order to understand better the molecular mechanisms by which stathmin interacts with tubulin, we examined which of the smallest stathmin fragments can retain the capacity to interact with tubulin. The strategy used to solve the stathmin interaction regions with tubulin combined proteolysis of stathmin, selection of fragments that retain affinity for tubulin by size exclusion chromatography, and their identification by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.In the present work we have found that a minimal stathmin consensus region from amino acid residues 42 to 126, referred to as the “core,” is necessary but not sufficient for interaction with tubulin. Interestingly this core corresponds to the entire predicted α-helix of domains I, II, and III, previously predicted to be the core of the interaction domain of stathmin with its functional targets and/or partners (10.Maucuer A. Camonis J.H. Sobel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3100-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). For its interaction with tubulin, we have found that this core must possess an extension at least of its N- or C-terminal region, the lengths of which are not yet precisely determined. One possibility is that to interact significantly with tubulin, the core needs to be extended with a few additional amino acids on either or both extremities. A more seducing hypothesis could be that tubulin binding to stathmin may occur in two different ways, an “N way” and a “C way,” in which either an N- or a C-terminal extension of the core would allow binding of stathmin to tubulin. The N way and the C way may thus reflect the existence on stathmin of two binding sites for tubulin, which could be related to the existence of a stathmin internal repeat (46.Maucuer A. Doye V. Sobel A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 264: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and which could account for the stoichiometry of the stathmin-tubulin complex of one stathmin molecule for two tubulins (αβ-heterodimers) (16.Curmi P.A. Andersen S.S.L. Lachkar S. Gavet O. Karsenti E. Knossow M. Sobel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25029-25036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 26.Jourdain L. Curmi P. Sobel A. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10817-10821Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). It should be noted that each of the folding hypotheses presented above displays a good accessibility of the core region for the interaction with tubulin, and each is compatible with the binding of two tubulin dimers per stathmin. The necessity of either an additional N- or C-terminal extension for the binding of the core to tubulin may also indicate the existence of a symmetry in the folding of part Ia and domain IV. Although we were not able in the present work to access directly the stathmin fragment to tubulin stoichiometry for all the interacting fragments, results obtained with specific stathmin fragments on tubulin polymerization suggest that it is as in the case of stathmin itself, of one fragment molecule for two tubulins (see below).The Potential of Interaction of a Stathmin Fragment Is of Predictive Value for Inhibition of Microtubule AssemblyTo evaluate the functional relevance of the stathmin-tubulin interaction results, we studied the effects on tubulin polymerization of three specific stathmin fragments representative of either the stathmin core, the N-way or the C-way. As expected, polymerization inhibition of tubulin was observed with the two fragments fitting the tubulin interaction requirements (fragments 12–125 and 44–138), whereas no effect on polymerization was noted with the fragment representative of the sole stathmin core (fragment 44–125). These observations suggest that the interaction constrains deduced from the present study should help to predict the effect of various stathmin fragments on tubulin polymerization. This hypothesis is in fact in line with previous results obtained by other investigators as follows: Marklund et al. (19.Marklund U. Larsson N. Melander Gradin H. Brattsand G. Gullberg M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5290-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) have shown that deletion of stathmin amino acid residues 4–55 resulted in a loss of its in vivo microtubule depolymerization activity, and Howell et al. (27.Howell B. Larsson N. Gullberg M. Cassimeris L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) have shown that the Δ100–147 mutant has lost its in vitrosequestering activity, whereas the Δ5–25 still retained it. Finally the coherence between results from our interaction and functional studies reinforces the idea that stathmin inhibits tubulin polymerization mainly by tubulin sequestration. In particular the prerequisite of a tubulin interaction potential for a stathmin fragment to inhibit microtubule assembly argues against the idea of a tubulin-directed regulatory activity of stathmin distinct from tubulin complex formation as proposed by Larsson et al. (49.Larsson N. Segerman B. Howell B. Fridell K. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1289-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).In conclusion, the delimitation of structured domains in stathmin should help to understand its interactions with protein partners and the regulatory role of phosphorylation in these processes. Furthermore, it should serve to optimize protein constructs for detailed structural analysis using x-ray diffraction or NMR spectroscopy. The identification of minimal stathmin regions still able to interact with tubulin will provide the basis to understand some of the functional properties of stathmin. It also represents a necessary step to design molecular tools targeted to disturb the stathmin-tubulin equilibrium that could in turn alter some of the tubulin-dependent processes, notably during the cell cycle, all these being under progress. Finally, we speculate that similar regions may be relevant in the other members of the stathmin family for their interaction with tubulin.AckowledgmentsWe thank Dr. Marcel Knossow for stimulating discussions and support and Dr. Alexandre Maucuer for critical reading of the manuscript.

We have elucidated here the mechanism whereby Mk CD9 influences Mk proHB-EGF and present evidence that Mk CD9 is a coreceptor for DT. We observed that Mk CD9 not only increased the DT sensitivity but also increased the DT receptor affinity of cells. Furthermore, the higher the Mk CD9/Mk proHB-EGF ratio, the higher the affinity. In contrast, mouse (Ms) CD9 did not increase the toxin sensitivity or receptor affinity of cells when co-expressed with Mk proHB-EGF. Using Mk/Ms chimeric CD9 molecules, we determined that the second extracellular domain of Mk CD9 is responsible for both increased sensitivity and receptor affinity. This domain of Mk CD9 also interacts with Mk proHB-EGF in a yeast two-hybrid system. Our findings thus suggest that Mk CD9 has a direct physical interaction with Mk proHB-EGF to form a DT receptor complex and that this contact may change the conformation of the receptor to increase DT binding affinity and consequently increase toxin sensitivity.

The toxin is translated as a single polypeptide (M r 58,342), and when it is subjected to partial proteolysis it is cleaved into two functionally distinct fragments, an A fragment (M r 21,167) and a B fragment (M r 37,195), that remain linked by a disulfide bond (1.Collier R.J.

DT binds through the B fragment to specific eukaryotic cell surface receptors; following binding, receptor-mediated endocytosis enables DT to enter the endosome/lysosome pathway (5.Dorland R.B. Middlebrook J.L. Leppla S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11337-11342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The acidic environment of the endosome causes conformational changes in DT that lead to the translocation and release of the A fragment into the cytosol; the A fragment is enzymatically active and inhibits protein synthesis by ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor 2. Despite the fact that all elongation factors 2 are susceptible to DT (6.Middlebrook J.L. Dorland R.B. Can. J. Microbiol. 1977; 23: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), only cells bearing specific DT receptors are DT-sensitive (7.Middlebrook J.L. Dorland R.B. Leppla S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7325-7330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our laboratory previously cloned the cDNA encoding a DT receptor from highly toxin-sensitive monkey (Mk) Vero cells (8.Naglich J.G. Metherall J.E. Russell D.W. Eidels L. Cell. 1992; 69: 1051-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The expression of the DT receptor in normally toxin-resistant mouse L-M(TK−) cells resulted in DT-sensitive cells (DTs-II) (8.Naglich J.G. Metherall J.E. Russell D.W. Eidels L. Cell. 1992; 69: 1051-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The predicted amino acid sequence of the DT receptor was found to be identical to that of the cell surface-expressed precursor of heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (proHB-EGF) (9.Higashiyama S. Abraham J.A. Miller J. Fiddes J.C. Klagsbrun M. Science. 1991; 251: 936-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar, 10.Higashiyama S. Lau K. Besner G.E. Abraham J.A. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6205-6212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mature/soluble heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) is a member of a family of growth factors that includes epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor α, and amphiregulin (11.Carpenter G. Wahl M.I. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. 95. Springer-Verlag, New York1990: 69-171Google Scholar). Analysis of the amino acid sequence of Mk proHB-EGF revealed a signal sequence (residues 1–23), an extracellular domain (residues 24–159), a transmembrane domain (residues 160–184), and a carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain (residues 185–208) (8.Naglich J.G. Metherall J.E. Russell D.W. Eidels L. Cell. 1992; 69: 1051-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 12.Cha J.-H. Brooke J.S. Eidels L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). On the cell surface, proHB-EGF may be cleaved and released as a mature/soluble HB-EGF (residues 63–148) (13.Goishi K. Higashiyama S. Klagsbrun M. Nakano N. Umata T. Ishikawa M. Mekada E. Taniguchi N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 967-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The released HB-EGF is able to act as a mitogen by binding to the EGF receptor (9.Higashiyama S. Abraham J.A. Miller J. Fiddes J.C. Klagsbrun M. Science. 1991; 251: 936-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar), while the remaining cell surface-bound proHB-EGF is able to function as a juxtacrine growth factor (14.Higashiyama S. Iwamoto R. Goishi K. Raab G. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) as well as a DT receptor in toxin-sensitive cells (8.Naglich J.G. Metherall J.E. Russell D.W. Eidels L. Cell. 1992; 69: 1051-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 15.Iwamoto R. Higashiyama S. Mitamura T. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2322-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Mekada and colleagues (16.Iwamoto R. Senoh H. Okada Y. Uchida T. Mekada E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20463-20469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) screened monoclonal antibodies raised to Vero cells and identified a monoclonal antibody that protected against DT-mediated cytotoxicity. The antigen (DRAP 27) that corresponded to the monoclonal antibody was cloned and characterized as the monkey homolog of the human CD9 antigen (17.Mitamura T. Iwamoto R. Umata T. Yomo T. Urabe I. Tsuneoka M. Mekada E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1389-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The Mk CD9 antigen alone didnot confer DT sensitivity to mouse L-M(TK−) cells, but cell surface Mk CD9 expression in a mildly DT-sensitive cell line caused an increased sensitivity to the toxin (17.Mitamura T. Iwamoto R. Umata T. Yomo T. Urabe I. Tsuneoka M. Mekada E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1389-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Our laboratory also showed that the expression of Mk CD9 in the already toxin-sensitive DTs-II cells made the cells hypersensitive to DT (a 10-fold increase in sensitivity) (18.Brown J.G. Almond B.D. Naglich J.G. Eidels L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8184-8188Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Therefore, Mk CD9 increases DT sensitivity when co-expressed with Mk proHB-EGF. CD9 is a member of the tetraspanin superfamily, which is characterized by the presence of four highly conserved hydrophobic transmembrane domains forming two extracellular domains (19.Wright M.D. Tomlinson M.G. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 588-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 20.Maecker H.T. Todd S.C. Levy S. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 428-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). The first extracellular domain between transmembrane domains 1 and 2 is small (20–27 amino acids), while the second extracellular domain between transmembrane domains 3 and 4 is larger (75–130 amino acids) (19.Wright M.D. Tomlinson M.G. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 588-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Both the amino and carboxyl termini of the tetraspanin superfamily contain short cytoplasmic domains (5–14 amino acids) (19.Wright M.D. Tomlinson M.G. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 588-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). CD9 is found in virtually all tissues along with other members of the superfamily including CD81, CD82, and CD63 (20.Maecker H.T. Todd S.C. Levy S. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 428-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). CD9 has been reported to be associated with such biological activities as platelet activation and adhesion, B-cell development, cell metastasis, and motility (19.Wright M.D. Tomlinson M.G. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 588-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar,20.Maecker H.T. Todd S.C. Levy S. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 428-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which Mk CD9 increases DT sensitivity of cells is not well understood. It is possible that Mk CD9 increases DT sensitivity by (i) increasing the number of DT receptors through a chaperone-like function and/or protecting them from proteolytic cleavage and/or (ii) increasing DT receptor affinity by a physical interaction on the cell surface that changes the conformation of the receptor. Previously, Brown et al. (18.Brown J.G. Almond B.D. Naglich J.G. Eidels L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8184-8188Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) characterized one cell line (DTs-III, a mouse L-M(TK−) cell line expressing both Mk CD9 and Mk proHB-EGF) and reported that the expression of cell surface Mk CD9 increased DT sensitivity of cells due to an increase in the number of DT-binding sites but apparently did not change DT receptor affinity. Iwamoto et al. (15.Iwamoto R. Higashiyama S. Mitamura T. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2322-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) characterized a similar cell line (also a mouse L-M(TK−)-like cell line expressing both Mk CD9 and human proHB-EGF) and reported the same increase in the number of DT-binding sites with no change in DT receptor affinity. Thus, it appeared that Mk CD9 increases DT sensitivity of cells by increasing the number of DT receptors. Recently, however, during our studies on the function of CD9, we observed several L-M(TK−) cell lines co-expressing Mk CD9 and Mk proHB-EGF that showed an altered DT receptor affinity. We have now carefully revisited this issue. In the present study, we have constructed cell lines that express different levels of cell surface Mk CD9 or Mk proHB-EGF, and we have analyzed the influence of these two components on both the DT sensitivity and DT receptor affinity of these cells. In addition, we identified which extracellular domain of Mk CD9 is responsible for the increased toxin receptor affinity and sensitivity of cells as well as for the direct physical interaction with proHB-EGF. We propose a new role of Mk CD9 as a coreceptor for DT. The plasmid vectors pcDNA3 and pCDM8, theEscherichia coli host strains TOP10F′ and DH5α, and the cDNA Cycle and Original TA Cloning (pCR2.1) kits were purchased from Invitrogen. BALB/c mouse lung poly(A)+ RNA was purchased from CLONTECH. [125I]NaI (IMS 30; 13–17 mCi/μg) andl-[4,5-3H]leucine (60 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Partially purified DT was purchased from Connaught Laboratories (Ontario, Canada), purified further by anion exchange chromatography according to published methods (21.Pappenheimer Jr., A.M. Uchida T. Harper A.A. Immunochemistry. 1972; 9: 891-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) with modifications, and radioiodinated as described elsewhere (22.Cieplak W. Gaudin H.M. Eidels L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13246-13253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal goat anti-human HB-EGF IgG was from R & D Systems. Monoclonal mouse anti-human CD9 IgG and rat anti-mouse CD9 IgG were from The Binding Site and PharMingen, respectively. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (rabbit anti-goat IgG, goat anti-mouse IgG, and goat anti-rat IgG) were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. All other reagents were as described previously (23.Almond B.D. Eidels L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26635-26641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,24.Cha J.-H. Brooke J.S. Eidels L. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1275-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of cell surface Mk CD9 on DT sensitivity and DT receptor affinity of cells, we used DTs-II-like cells (L-M(TK−) cells that express Mk proHB-EGF) as hosts for the expression of Mk CD9. We reported previously that the original DTs-II cell line had a high nonspecific binding of radioiodinated DT (over 35%), due to a low cell surface Mk proHB-EGF expression (18.Brown J.G. Almond B.D. Naglich J.G. Eidels L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8184-8188Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was necessary to construct a new host cell line that has a high level of cell surface Mk proHB-EGF expression and shows a low nonspecific binding of DT. This new host cell line was constructed by transfection of pMkHB-EGF into the normally DT-resistant mouse L-M(TK−) cell line and cloned as described previously (24.Cha J.-H. Brooke J.S. Eidels L. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1275-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The cloned cell line stably expressing the highest level of cell surface Mk proHB-EGF was designated as DTs-IIh and was used throughout this study. DT binding assays with this cell line and with DTs-IIh transfectants expressing cell surface Mk or mouse (Ms) CD9 showed a low level of nonspecific binding of radioiodinated DT (10–20%). To examine the influence of cell surface expression of Mk proHB-EGF on DT sensitivity and DT receptor affinity of cells, we used LCD9 cells as hosts. LCD9 cells are mouse L-M(TK−) cells that stably express Mk CD9 (DRAP27) cell surface molecules (18.Brown J.G. Almond B.D. Naglich J.G. Eidels L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8184-8188Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The LCD9 cell line is DT-resistant and hygromycin-resistant; the construction and biochemical characterization of this cell line is described in detail elsewhere (18.Brown J.G. Almond B.D. Naglich J.G. Eidels L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8184-8188Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). LCD9 cells were transfected with pMkHB-EGF and cloned cell lines stably expressing different levels of Mk proHB-EGF were obtained. The plasmid pcDNA3 is a mammalian expression vector that allows growth of mammalian cells in the presence of Geneticin. Mk proHB-EGF (8.Naglich J.G. Metherall J.E. Russell D.W. Eidels L. Cell. 1992; 69: 1051-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) and Ms proHB-EGF (K133I/H141E) cDNAs (24.Cha J.-H. Brooke J.S. Eidels L. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1275-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) were subcloned into pcDNA3 using the HindIII andXbaI restriction sites as described previously (24.Cha J.-H. Brooke J.S. Eidels L. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1275-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids were named pMkHB-EGF and pMsHB-EGF(K133I/H141E), respectively. Previously, to express Mk CD9, cotransfection of pCD9 and pHyg into cells (18.Brown J.G. Almond B.D. Naglich J.G. Eidels L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8184-8188Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) was performed. To improve the transfection efficiency it was necessary to construct a vector that carries both a high expression promoter and a hygromycin resistance selectable marker. pCMV7, a strong mammalian expression vector that carries a CMV promoter, was modified for the present study by adding a hygromycin resistance selectable marker. pCMV7 is a derivative of pCMV5 (25.Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlback H. Jornvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Hobman T.C. Lundstrom M.L. Gillam S. Virology. 1990; 178: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), into which a generic intron consisting of a 5′ donor from adenovirus (160-base pair fragment) and a 3′ acceptor from an immunoglobulin gene (100-base pair fragment) (27.Kaufman R.J. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1304-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 28.Huang M.T. Gorman C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 937-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) were ligated into the EcoRI andPstI sites of pCMV5. The hygromycin resistance gene was excised from pBabe-Hygro (29.Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar), a poly(A) termination sequence was added at its 3′-end, and the fragment (the hygromycin resistance gene with the SV40 intron/pA termination sequence) was introduced downstream of the SV40 ori promoter of pCMV7. The resulting plasmid is named pCHA7; the plasmid carries the strong CMV promoter and the hygromycin resistance gene under the control of the SV40 oripromoter. The pCHA7 vector was used for the transfections of DTs-IIh cells and subsequent expression of Mk CD9, Ms CD9, MsCD9-MkIex, and MsCD9-MkIIex(Fig. 4). Mk CD9 cDNA was subcloned from pCD9 (18.Brown J.G. Almond B.D. Naglich J.G. Eidels L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8184-8188Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) usingPstI and BamHI restriction enzymes into the same restriction sites of pCHA7. For Ms CD9 cDNA, the first-strand Ms cDNA was generated by reverse transcriptase-PCR (using the cDNA Cycle Kit) from BALB/c mouse lung poly(A)+ RNA, and the Ms CD9 was amplified from the Ms cDNA using the primers MsCD9(5′) and MsCD9(3′) listed in Table I. The PCR fragment was cloned into pCR2.1, resulting in pCR2.1-MsCD9. The fragment was digested with XbaI andBamHI restriction enzymes from pCR2.1-MsCD9 and subcloned into the same restriction sites of pCHA7, resulting in pMsCD9. The Ms CD9 gene was confirmed by automated sequencing using the ABI PRISM dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (purchased from Perkin-Elmer) with the ABI Prism 377 DNA Sequencer at the sequencing facilities of our institution. This sequence of Ms CD9 reveals three different nucleotides (C363T, T408A, and A447G) from the previously reported sequence of Ms CD9 (30.Rubinstein E. Billard M. Plaisance S. Prenant M. Boucheix C. Thromb. Res. 1993; 71: 377-383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), but these differences did not change the deduced amino acid sequence.Table IPrimers used for chimeric CD9 constructsPrimersPrimer sequencesMsCD9(5′)GC TCTAGATGCCGGTCAAAGGAGGTAGCAAGTGCMsCD9(3′)CG GGATCCTAGACCATTTCTCGGCTCCTGCGGATGGExI-1-upCAGTGCTTGCTATTGGACTATGG CTGCGATTCGACTCTCAGACCExI-1-downGGTCTGAGAGTCGAATCGCAG CCATAGTCCAATAGCAAGCACTGExI-2-upCAATAATAATTCCAGCTTCTACACA GGAGTGTACATTCTGATTGGAGCExI-2-downGCTCCAATCAGAATGTACACTCC TGTGTAGAAGCTGGAATTATTATTGExII-1-upCCGCCGTCTGGGGCTATACC CACAAGGATGAGGTGATTAAGGExII-1-downCCTTAATCACCTCATCCTTGTG GGTATAGCCCCAGACGGCGGExII-2-upCATCAAAGAGGTCTTCGACAATAAA TTCCACATCATTGGAGCAGTGGExII-2-downCCACTGCTCCAATGATGTGGAA TTTATTGTCGAAGACCTCTTTGATGBoldface italic letters indicate Mk CD9 sequences.

Two italic letters in the sequence of MsCD9(5′) and MsCD9(3′) primers indicate the extra sequence for the XbaI and BamHI digestions. Two chimeric CD9 constructs (MsCD9-MkIex and MsCD9-MkIIex; Fig. 4) were generated using the PCR technique of gene fusion by overlap extension (31.Horton R.M. Cai Z.L. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Horton R.M. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Hunt H.D. Cai Z. Pease L.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Five PCRs using six primers listed in Table I were performed to construct each of the CD9 chimeras. The first chimera, MsCD9-MkIex, was constructed as follows. A DNA fragment (designated as Ms1–34) encoding Ms CD9 amino acid residues 1–34 was PCR-amplified from pMsCD9 with primers MsCD9(5′) and ExI-1-down. A second DNA fragment (designated as MkIex) encoding Mk CD9 amino acid residues 35–58 was PCR-amplified from pMkCD9 with primers ExI-1-up and ExI-2-down. A third DNA fragment (designated as Ms55–226) encoding Ms CD9 amino residues 55–226 was PCR-amplified from pMsCD9 with primers ExI-2-up and MsCD9(3′). The PCR fragments of Ms1–34 and MkIex were combined and amplified with MsCD9(5′) and ExI-2-down, resulting in Ms34MkIex. The PCR fragments of Ms34MkIex and Ms55–226 were combined and amplified with MsCD9(5′) and MsCD9(3′), resulting in MsCD9-MkIex. The PCR product (MsCD9-MkIex) was digested with XbaI andBamHI restriction enzymes (these restriction sites were incorporated in the PCR primers) and subcloned into the same sites of pCHA7, resulting in pMsCD9-MkIex. The sequence of MsCD9-MkIex insert was confirmed by automated sequencing as described above. The second chimera, MsCD9-MkIIex, was constructed as follows. A DNA fragment (designated as Ms1–110) encoding Ms CD9 amino acid residues 1–110 was PCR-amplified from pMsCD9 with primers MsCD9(5′) and ExII-1-down. A second DNA fragment (designated as MkIIex) encoding Mk CD9 amino acid residues 113–192 was PCR-amplified from pMkCD9 with primers ExII-1-up and ExII-2-down. A third DNA fragment (designated as Ms191–226) encoding Ms CD9 amino residues 191–226 was PCR-amplified from pMsCD9 with primers ExII-2-up and MsCD9(3′). The PCR fragments of MkIIex and Ms191–226 were combined and amplified with ExII-1-up and MsCD9(3′), resulting in MkIIex119Ms. The PCR fragments of Ms1–110 and MkIIex119Ms were combined and amplified with MsCD9(5′) and MsCD9(3′), resulting in MsCD9-MkIIex. The PCR product (MsCD9-MkIIex) was digested with XbaI andBamHI restriction enzymes (these restriction sites were incorporated in the PCR primers) and subcloned into the same sites of pCHA7, resulting in pMsCD9-MkIIex. The insert was confirmed by automated sequencing as described above. Electroporation was used to transfect plasmid DNA into L-M(TK−), LCD9, DTs-IIh, and Ms(K133I/H141E) cells using the BTX ECM 600 system as described previously (24.Cha J.-H. Brooke J.S. Eidels L. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1275-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. To select Geneticin-resistant or hygromycin-resistant cell lines we used a selective medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2.5 μg/ml amphotericin B, 2 mml-glutamine, and 1 mg/ml Geneticin or 0.5 mg/ml hygromycin). The cloned proHB-EGF transfectants were screened by the abbreviated cytotoxicity assay described below, and the cloned CD9 transfectants were screened by a quantitative whole cell ELISA described below. To quantify the level of cell surface expression of CD9 and proHB-EGF, quantitative whole cell ELISAs on formalin-fixed cells were performed as described previously (18.Brown J.G. Almond B.D. Naglich J.G. Eidels L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8184-8188Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Each cell line was seeded in triplicate wells. Each ELISA included the wild-type Mk proHB-EGF cell line (this cell line expresses both Mk proHB-EGF and Mk CD9 on the cell surface) described previously (24.Cha J.-H. Brooke J.S. Eidels L. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1275-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) as a positive control and the L-M(TK−) cell line as a negative control. For the detection of cell surface Mk CD9, the primary antibody employed was a mouse anti-human CD9 IgG, and the secondary antibody was a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. Cell surface Ms CD9 expression was assayed using as primary antibody a rat anti-mouse CD9 IgG and as secondary antibody a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG. The mouse anti-human CD9 IgG and the rat anti-mouse CD9 IgG recognize the second extracellular domain of Mk and Ms CD9, respectively. The antibodies used to detect Mk CD9 and Ms CD9 on the cell surface did not show any cross-reactivity. Cell surface MsCD9-MkIex expression was assayed using as primary antibody the rat anti-mouse CD9 IgG and as secondary antibody the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG. For the detection of cell surface MsCD9-MkIIex, the primary antibody employed was the mouse anti-human CD9 IgG, and the secondary antibody was a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. For the detection of cell surface proHB-EGF, the primary antibody employed was a goat anti-human HB-EGF IgG (which reacts strongly with Mk proHB-EGF and weakly with Ms proHB-EGF), and the secondary antibody was a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG. We used the previously described abbreviated cytotoxicity assay (23.Almond B.D. Eidels L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26635-26641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Cha J.-H. Brooke J.S. Eidels L. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1275-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) to observe the inhibition of protein synthesis by DT. Cells were tested with one concentration of DT (1 μg/ml) and no DT as a negative control. Protein synthesis inhibition was measured by [3H]leucine incorporation into acid-precipitable radioactivity as described previously (33.Proia R.L. Eidels L. Hart D.A. J. Biol.

Cell lines in which protein synthesis was inhibited by 50% or more at 1 μg/ml DT were considered DT-sensitive, and those showing less than 50% inhibition were considered DT-resistant. Each assay included the Mk proHB-EGF cell line described previously (24.Cha J.-H. Brooke J.S. Eidels L. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1275-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) as a positive control and the LCD9 cell line as a negative control. All individual DT-sensitive cell lines were chosen, subcloned to obtain a pure stable cell population, and reexamined using the complete cytotoxicity assay, the quantitative whole cell ELISAs for cell surface expression of proHB-EGF and CD9, and the radiolabeled DT binding assay described below. We used the cytotoxicity assay described previously (24.Cha J.-H. Brooke J.S. Eidels L. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1275-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cells were tested with DT concentrations of 0, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, and 1000 ng/ml. All cloned DT-sensitive stable cell lines showed at least 80% protein synthesis inhibition at 1 μg/ml DT. All assays were performed in duplicate, and at least two separate assays were performed for each cell line. Each assay included the same positive and negative control cell lines described above for the abbreviated cytotoxicity assay. The ability of cell surface Mk or Ms (K133I/H141E) proHB-EGF-expressing cell lines to bind radioiodinated DT was examined as described previously (8.Naglich J.G. Metherall J.E. Russell D.W. Eidels L.

The expression of thehisG promoter is positively regulated by ppGpp, whereas that of the leuV promoter (of tRNA1eu) is negatively regulated by ppGpp. In an attempt to understand the global regulatory mechanism of ppGpp control, interrelationship between ppGpp-dependent activation and repression of gene expression was examined using these promoters as models. It has been traditionally supposed that the ppGpp-dependent regulation, at least for the activation, is by a passive mode of control: the activation of gene expression by ppGpp is a consequence of the repression of stable RNA gene expression in the condition of RNA polymerase limiting. To test this model, the ppGpp-dependent regulations of both an activable promoter (hisGp) and a repressible promoter (leuVp) were determined in vitro simultaneously using a mixed template setup. The rationale for this exercise was to see whether the ppGpp-dependent activation and repression are inversely correlated in the in vitro condition in which RNA polymerase is limiting. No correlation was observed. It was concluded that the ppGpp-dependent activation is independent of the repression.

The hallmark of the gene expression changes after amino acid starvation is reduction of stable RNA synthesis and increase of amino acid biosynthesis gene expression. This global response is referred to as the “stringent response,” and it is mediated by guanosine 5′-diphosphate 3′-diphosphate (ppGpp)1 (for review, see Refs. 1.Gallant J.A. Annu. Rev.

The ppGpp is a pleiotrophic regulatory effector exerting both negative and positive effects on gene expression in bacteria. Studies of the molecular mechanism by which ppGpp acts to regulate gene expression have resulted in controversial conclusions, although it is generally accepted that the primary regulatory effect of ppGpp is at the level of transcription initiation for both positively and negatively controlled genes (2.Cashel M. Rudd K.E. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987: 1410-1438Google Scholar, 3.Cashel M.

This hypothesis is based on analyses of the amino acid prototrophic suppressor mutants arising spontaneously from the strain that was unable to synthesize ppGpp (3.Cashel M. Gentry D. Hernendez V.J.

Bremer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2337-2344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, direct binding of ppGpp to the β subunit of RNA polymerase has been shown byin vitro cross-linking studies with fluorescent-labeled ppGpp (7.Reddy P.S. Raghavan A. Chatterji D. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 255-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) or azido-ppGpp (8.Chatterji D. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Genes Cells. 1998; 5: 279-287Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, a negative regulatory effect of ppGpp on the stable RNA promoters has been demonstrated using a minimal in vitro transcription system composed of purified component only with a special condition: a linear DNA template at a high-salt condition (9.Kajitani M. Ishihama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1951-1957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Ohlesn K.I. Gralla J.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2243-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The possibility was raised long ago, but not resolved, that a factor might mediate the regulatory effect of ppGpp (1.Gallant J.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1979; 13: 393-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 11.Aboud M. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3356-3358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Aboud M. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 2189-2195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At least for the stimulatory effect of ppGpp, the activation of lac (of Escherichia coli) or his (of Salmonella typhimurium) gene expression was observed using the in vitro system containing S-30 cell extract in a manner comparable with that observedin vivo but not with purified components (13.De Crombrugghe B.

A. 1986; 83: 9333-9337Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It was tentatively inferred that a factor missing in the minimal transcription system is required to demonstrate, at least, the stimulatory effect of ppGpp (12.Aboud M. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 2189-2195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.De Crombrugghe B. Chen B. Andersen W. Nissley P. Gottesman M. Pastan I. Perlman R. Nat. New Biol. 1971; 231: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In an attempt to explain the global effect of stringent regulation, especially for positive effect, various passive regulation models have been introduced. The model currently proposed by Zhou and Jin (16.Zhou Y.N. Jin D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2908-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) is based on the assumption that there are two classes of promoters with different rate-limiting steps: RNA polymerase binding for amino acid biosynthesis promoters (positively regulated by ppGpp) and an isomerization step for stable RNA promoters (negatively regulated by ppGpp). In the absence of ppGpp, during rapid growth, most RNA polymerases are engaged in the transcription of stable RNA genes but not in that of amino acid biosynthesis genes. During stringent response, an elevated level of ppGpp destablizes the open promoter complex formation at the stable RNA promoters (5.Bartlett M.M. Gaal T. Ross W. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 331-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 6.Tedin K. Bremer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2337-2344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which results in an increase of free RNA polymerase inside the cell. Consequently, amino acid biosynthesis genes are transcribed. Thus, stimulation of amino acid biosynthesis genes on stringent response is a consequence of reduced transcription of stable RNA genes in the condition of RNA polymerase limiting. In contrast, Jensen and colleagues claimed that stable RNA promoters have relatively low affinity for RNA polymerase and high V max for open complex formation and promoter clearance (17.Jensen K.F. Pederson S. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 89-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Vogel U. Sorenson M. Pederson S. Jensen K.F. Kilstrup M. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2191-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The major effect of ppGpp was suggested to be on RNA polymerization such that ppGpp reduces the rate of transcription elongation, which subsequently limits the quantity of free RNA polymerase able to initiate transcription. (4.Hernendez V.J. Cashel M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 536-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 17.Jensen K.F. Pederson S. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 89-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Vogel U. Sorenson M. Pederson S. Jensen K.F. Kilstrup M. Mol.

A reduced pool of free RNA polymerase would then reduce the transcription initiation more drastically with those stable RNA promoters that have low affinity for RNA polymerase than with amino acid biosynthesis promoters, thereby achieving a differential regulatory effect on gene expression. It should be noted that these models evolved from the passive regulation model originally proposed by Maaloe (21.Maaloe, O. (1968) in Biochemistry of Ribosomes and Messenger-RNA (Lindigkeit, R., Langen, P., and Richter, J., eds), pp. 231–235, Symposium, Castle ReinhardsbrunnGoogle Scholar, 22.Maaloe O. Dev. Biol. 1969; 3: 33-58Google Scholar, 23.Maaloe O. Biological Regulation and Development, Gene Expression. 1. Plenum, New York1979: 487-542Google Scholar) to account for the growth rate control of ribosome synthesis: those genes encoding ribosomal components were constitutively derepressed, not under any active control. This idea was further developed into an “RNA polymerase partitioning model” by Baracchini and Bremer (24.Baracchini E. Bremer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2597-2602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to account for ppGpp-dependent differential gene regulation: RNA polymerases exist in two forms with different promoter specificity, and the relative amounts of the two forms are dependent on intracellular concentration of ppGpp. To understand the molecular mechanism of ppGpp-mediated regulation, especially that of gene activation, a “mixed template” in vitro experiment using a cell-free transcription-translation system was devised in this study (25.Choy H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1353: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 26.Lesley S.A. Tymm M.J. Methods in Molecular Biology: In vitro Transcription and Translation Protocols. 37. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1995: 265-277Google Scholar). More specifically, the passive model of differential gene regulation by ppGpp was testedin vitro by varying those crucial elements of regulation: the ppGpp concentration, gene dosage (DNA template concentration), and RNA polymerase concentration. This systematic in vitroanalysis was expected to provide a more direct measurement of ppGpp effects without the possible complications faced when carried outin vivo. The DNA templates directing expression of either the hisG promoter (his operon), regulated positively by ppGpp (15.Riggs D.L. Mueller R.D. Kwan H.S. Artz S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9333-9337Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 25.Choy H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1353: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 27.Stephens J.C. Artz S.W. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4389-4393Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), or the leuV promoter (tRNA1eu operon), regulated negatively by ppGpp (28.Bauer B.F. Kar E.G. Elford R.M. Holmes W.M. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 63: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 29.Rowley K.B. Elford R.M. Roberts I. Holmes W.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1309-1325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were tested. Both promoters have been demonstrated to be regulated by a physiological concentration of ppGpp using the crude in vitro system (25.Choy H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1353: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The main idea of this exercise was to observe the response of these promoters to ppGpp in a mixed template condition in which RNA polymerase is limiting. It was concluded from this study that ppGpp-mediated gene activation is independent of repression, and both activation and repression are mediated by different titratable factors, each of which operates independently. The construction of pAZ2 directing expression of his promoters of S. typhimurium has been described (16.Zhou Y.N. Jin D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2908-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Briefly, pAZ2 had the fragment extending from the hisGp promoter/regulatory region to the amino terminus of the third structural gene of thehis operon, hisC, fused in-frame to the1acZ gene of a translational fusion vector, pJES35 (30.Hirschman J. Wong P.-K. Sei K. Keener J. Kustu S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7525-7529Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The presence of an operon-specific attenuator in these plasmids has been shown to have little effect on ppGpp regulation (16.Zhou Y.N. Jin D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2908-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). pAZ16 is identical to pAZ2, except that it carried TATAAT at the −10 hexamer ofhisGp. The pLC76 and pLeuS plasmids directing expression from the wild-type and the mutant tRNA1eu promoter (leuVp) of E. coli, respectively, have been described elsewhere (28.Bauer B.F. Kar E.G. Elford R.M. Holmes W.M. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 63: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 29.Rowley K.B. Elford R.M. Roberts I. Holmes W.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1309-1325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, plasmid pLC76 carried theleuVp promoter sequence from −45 to +8 of leuVp (synthesized in vitro) cloned into the multiple cloning site, upstream of the promoterless gene of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) in a transcriptional fusion vector, pSL100 (31.Li S.C. Squires C.L. Squires C. Cell. 1984; 38: 851-860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Plasmid pLeuS was identical to the pLC76, except that the discriminator sequence between −1 and −4 of leuVp was altered. To propagate plasmids an E. coli strain, JM103, Δ(lac-pro)supE thi strA sbcB15 endA hspR4 [F′ traD36 proAB 1acI (LacIq)Δ lacZM15], was used (32.Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 20-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (3419) Google Scholar). For the preparation of plasmid DNA template, pAZ plasmids were amplified with chloramphenicol (0.17 mg/ml), and plasmids pLC76 and pLeuS were amplified with spectinomycin (0.3 mg/ml); these plasmids were isolated by the cleared lysate protocol and purified with two cycles of CsC1 gradient centrifugation (33.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The preparation of S-30 cell extract and the in vitro reaction mixtures was essentially as described by Choy (25.Choy H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1353: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) using a glutamate substitution modification. S. typhimurium strain TA705 (hisΔOGDCBH2253 hisT1504 relA1) (34.Martin, R. G. (1968) J. Mol. Biol. 127–134Google Scholar) was used to prepare an S-30 cell extract. The preparation and procedure for the mixed template experiment were the same as for the single-template experiment. Assay conditions and procedures for β-galactosidase enzyme were essentially as described by Lesley (26.Lesley S.A. Tymm M.J. Methods in Molecular Biology: In vitro Transcription and Translation Protocols. 37. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1995: 265-277Google Scholar). The assay condition and procedure for CAT enzyme were described by Choy (25.Choy H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1353: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The expression from hisGp of the hisoperon in S. typhimurium (15.Riggs D.L. Mueller R.D. Kwan H.S. Artz S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1309-1325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was determined as a function of the DNA template concentrations in vitro using a coupled transcription and translation system containing an S-30 cell extract of S. typhimurium (Figs.1 and 2). To examine the regulatory effect of ppGpp, the DNA template titration was carried out in both the absence and presence of ppGpp. The DNA templates directing expression of these promoters were from supercoiled plasmids pAZ2 (hisGp) and pLC76 (leuVp).Figure 2pLC76 (carrying leuVp) titration in the presence of 0 (circles), 0.2 (triangles), and 0.4 (squares) mm ppGpp. The expression from leuVp was determined by measuring CAT units/50 μl as a function of DNA template concentration.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 1 shows the hisGp DNA (pAZ2) titration by measuring β-galactosidase activity as a function of DNA concentration. The β-galactosidase activity from the chimerichisC-lacZ protein represents the hisGpromoter activity. Approximately 70 nm of DNA template saturated the crude in vitro system in the presence or absence of ppGpp; hisGp expression in the presence of 0.1 mm ppGpp was elevated ∼10-fold over the range of saturating DNA concentrations (>70 nm). Note that the saturating DNA concentrations in the presence or absence of ppGpp were about the same. The concentration of 0.1 mm ppGpp used in this experiment was within the range of concentrations that stimulatedhisGp expression maximally in the presence of a saturating concentration of DNA template (15.Riggs D.L. Mueller R.D. Kwan H.S. Artz S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9333-9337Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 25.Choy H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1353: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 27.Stephens J.C. Artz S.W. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4389-4393Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In the case of the leuVp DNA (pLC76) titration, the CAT activity was determined as a function of DNA concentration (Fig.2). The CAT activity from theleuV-cat fusion represents the leuV promoter activity. Approximately 40 nm of DNA template saturated the crude in vitro system in the absence of ppGpp. However, in the presence of increasing concentrations of ppGpp, theleuVp DNA (pLC76) titration curve shifted to the higher DNA concentrations. Concentrations of 0.2 and 0.4 nm ppGpp inhibited leuVp expression 50 and 80%, respectively, when 40 nm DNA was used (see Fig. 4 in Ref. 25.Choy H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1353: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). It should be noticed that despite the shift of curves to the higher concentrations of DNA in the presence of ppGpp, activities at the saturating DNA altered little. This result demonstrates that the inhibitory effect of ppGpp on stable RNA gene expression is relieved by increasing DNA concentration. In an attempt to examine the pleiotrophic regulatory effect of ppGpp in a physiologically more relevant condition, we designed a mixed template experiment in which the activities of activable and repressible promoters could be determined simultaneously. This was feasible because the two promoters were fused to different reporter genes. The intent was to determine whether the stimulation and inhibition of protein synthesis by ppGpp are interrelated under the condition in which RNA polymerase is limiting. An in vitro condition in which RNA polymerase is limiting was created by the use of a saturating concentration of DNA template (see below). The hisGp DNA (pAZ2) was titrated by determining the expression from hisGp in the presence or absence of 0.1 mm ppGpp in a mixed template condition in which a fixed, saturating concentration of leuVp DNA (pLC76) was included. In this experiment, the changes in the magnitude of ppGpp inhibition on leuVp expression in the presence of an increasing concentration of an activable promoter, hisGp, were examined. The 0.1 mm ppGpp concentration used in this experiment inhibits the expression from leuVp DNA ∼30%, yet it is within the range of concentrations that stimulatehisGp expression maximally (25.Choy H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1353: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The expression ofhisGp increased with increasing concentration of DNA template and began to reach saturation at ∼65 nm in the presence or absence of 0.1 mm ppGpp (Fig.3 A). The stimulation ofhisGp expression by ppGpp was similar to that in the single-template condition (Fig. 1), but the magnitude was somewhat enhanced in the presence of leuVp DNA: 19- versus10-fold. The expression from leuVp, in the same reaction tubes (the relative activity shown in Fig. 3 B) declined progressively with increasing hisGp DNA, but the decline was similar in both the presence and absence of ppGpp (Fig. 3 B). Thus, the relative inhibition of leuVp expression (Fig.3 B, square symbols) by 0.1 mm ppGpp was altered little: 32% in the absence of hisGp DNA and 42% in the presence of 77 nm hisGp DNA. Apparently, the stimulation of hisGp expression by ppGpp has relatively little impact on the inhibition of leuVp expression. To verify that the limitation imposed in these mixed template conditions was RNA polymerase, RNA polymerase was added in the presence of 65 nm hisGp and 46 nm LeuVp in the absence of ppGpp (Fig. 3 C). In this mixed template condition, hisGp activity was reduced ∼30% and leuVp activity was reduced ∼50% compared with those in the single-template condition. The addition of RNA polymerase increased the expression from both promoters, indicating that the RNA polymerase, but no other component in this DNA-dependent protein expression system, was limiting. Thus, any change in either promoter activity should be reflected by corresponding changes in the competing promoter activity in this condition of RNA polymerase limiting. This was the converse of the experiments described above (Fig. 3). The leuVp DNA (pLC76) was titrated in the presence or absence of 0.1 mm ppGpp in a mixed template condition in which a fixed, saturating concentration of hisGp DNA (pAZ2) was included (Fig. 4). Thus, in this experiment the changes in stimulatory effect on hisGp expression by ppGpp in the presence of increasing concentrations of a repressible promoter, leuVp, were determined. The expression from leuVp increased with increasing concentrations of DNA template and saturated the in vitrosystem at ∼30 to ∼40 nm in the absence of ppGpp (Fig.4 A). The presence of ppGpp shifted the titration curve to higher concentrations of DNA similar to those observed in the single-template condition (Fig. 2). Thus, the regulatory effect of ppGpp on leuVp expression appears to be minimally affected by the concomitant hisGp expression. The expression from hisGp in the same reaction tubes declined more drastically in the absence of ppGpp (Fig. 4 B). This resulted in a greater stimulation of hisGp by ppGpp in the presence of leuVp expression: ∼10-fold in the absence ofleuVp DNA (pLC76) and ∼53-fold with 0.1 mmppGpp at the highest leuVp concentration (58 nm;Fig. 4 B, square symbols). Thus, the stimulatory effect of ppGpp on hisGp expression was not reduced but enhanced in the presence of a repressible promoter, leuVp. The mutant leuVp DNA (pLeuS) contains GCGTTTT in place of the wild-type sequence, GCGCCTC, at the discriminator (29.Rowley K.B. Elford R.M. Roberts I. Holmes W.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1309-1325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This base pair substitution mutation rendered the leuVp insensitive to ppGpp-mediated inhibition (Figs. 5 and6). The stimulatory effect of ppGpp (0.1 mm) onhisGp expression was examined in the presence of this neutral leuV promoter. Fig. 5 shows a titration ofhisGp DNA (pAZ2) in the presence or absence of 0.1 mm ppGpp in a mixed template setup containing a fixed saturating concentration of the discriminator mutant leuVp DNA (pLeuS, 35 nm). Thus, this is comparable with the experiment carried out with the wild-type leuVp DNA shown in Fig. 3. An almost identical result was obtained, except that expression from the discriminator mutant leuVp was about the same in the presence or absence of 0.1 mm ppGpp.Figure 6pLeuS (carrying the mutantleuVp) titration in the presence of 65 nmpAZ2 (carrying hisGp) with or without 0.1 mm ppGpp. A, expression from the mutantleuVp in the presence (closed triangles) or absence (open triangles) of ppGpp as determined by measuring CAT units/50 μl; B, expression from hisGp in the presence (closed circles) or absence (open circles) of ppGpp as determined by measuring the β-galactosidase activity (A 420/h/50 μl); the fold stimulation by ppGpp (squares) was obtained by dividing the β-galactosidase activity in the presence of ppGpp by that in the absence of ppGpp. The relative activity was calculated as a fraction of maximum activity in the single-template condition: 116 CAT units/50 μl for the 35 nm leuVp activity in the absence of ppGpp; 4.0 A 420/h/50 μl for the 65 nm hisGp activity in the presence of ppGpp.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 6 shows the converse experiment, in which discriminator mutant leuVp DNA(pLeuS) was titrated in the presence of a fixed saturating concentration of wild-typehisGp DNA (pAZ2, 65 nm). Again, ppGpp had little effect on the expression from the discriminator mutant leuVpromoter. The discriminator mutant leuVp DNA titration in the presence of wild-type hisGp DNA (Fig. 6 A) was almost the same as that in the single-template condition (data not shown). The expression from hisGp declined with increasing concentration of the discriminator mutant leuVp DNA (pLeuS) in the presence or absence of 0.1 mm ppGpp (Fig.6 B) and was similar to that in the presence of increasing wild-type leuVp DNA (pLC76), as shown in Fig. 4 B. The stimulation by ppGpp on hisGp expression was enhanced: ∼10-fold in the absence and ∼45-fold at the highest concentration of the discriminator mutant leuVp DNA (58 nm) (Fig. 6 B, square symbols). Thus, stimulation ofhisGp expression by ppGpp in the presence of the neutral mutant promoter was similar to that in the presence of the repressible wild-type promoter. The mutant allele of hisGp,hisGp3400, has the consensus sequence of Eς70promoter at the −10 region, which relieves the requirement for ppGpp for maximal expression (15.Riggs D.L. Mueller R.D.

Substitution of asparagine for threonine at amino acid 19 in RhoA is believed to induce a dominant negative function because of the increased association of RhoAAsn-19 with a GEF. Competitive binding of a specific GEF by RhoAAsn-19 may inhibit the GEF from interacting with endogenous RhoA. This event would disrupt any signal transduction pathway that normally utilizes the GEF. This model of how RhoAAsn-19 induces a dominant negative phenotype is based on previous studies using mutant Ras proteins with the analogous substitution of asparagine for serine at amino acid 17 (16.Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 17.Farnsworth C.L. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4822-4829Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). These studies support the model that RasAsn-17 has a dominant negative function because it competitively binds a GEF needed for the activation of endogenous Ras (16.Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 17.Farnsworth C.L. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4822-4829Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, the GEFs that are preferentially bound by RasAsn-17 or RhoAAsn-19 in vivo have not been characterized. The potential dependence of endogenous RhoA on the proteins competitively bound by RhoAAsn-19 provides a strong rationale for identifying the proteins associating with RhoAAsn-19 in vivo. For this reason, we investigated the in vivo characteristics of hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged wild-type and mutant RhoA stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells.RESULTSThe in vivo guanine nucleotide exchange activities of the HA-tagged wild-type and mutant RhoA proteins were determined by measuring the amounts of [32P]GTP and [32P]GDP bound to these proteins in32P-labeled cells (Fig.1 A). Wild-type RhoA is in the predominantly [32P]GDP-bound form, whereas activated RhoAVal-14 is in the predominantly [32P]GTP-bound form in the 32P-labeled cells (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, only minimal levels of [32P]GDP and [32P]GTP are bound to RhoAAsn-19 in the 32P-labeled cells (Fig.1 A, lane 3). Both wild-type RhoA and activated RhoAVal-14 were found to bind significant levels of [35S]GTPγS after a 10-min incubation of cell membranes with [35S]GTPγS (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, minimal levels of [35S]GTPγS are bound to dominant negative RhoAAsn-19 (Fig. 1 B).HA-tagged RhoA proteins were immunoprecipitated from35S-labeled cells and examined for co-precipitating proteins (Fig. 2 A). A 28-kDa protein co-precipitates with wild-type RhoA (lane 2, Fig.2 A). Western blotting identified this protein as RhoGDI (Fig. 2 B). RhoGDI does not associate with dominant negative RhoAAsn-19 (lane 3, Fig. 2 A), and it associates only weakly with activated RhoAVal-14(lane 4, Fig. 2 A). The 150-kDa protein that associates only with wild-type RhoA (lane 2, Fig.2 A) has not yet been identified.Figure 2HA-tagged wild-type and mutant RhoA associate with different intracellular proteins. A, the HA antibody was used to immunoprecipitate proteins from equal numbers of35S-labeled m3Zeo-2 cells (lane 1), m3WTRho-1 cells (lane 2), m3DNRho-4 cells (lane 3), or m3CARho-4 cells (lane 4). Proteins identified by peptide sequencing (SmgGDS) or Western blotting (HA-RhoA and RhoGDI) are indicated by their names at the left of the figure. Similar results were obtained in three other independent experiments.B, HA-RhoA was immunoprecipitated from m3WTRho-1 cells and subjected to ECL-Western blotting using antibodies to HA (lane 1) or RhoGDI (lane 2). The immunoreactive protein migrating at 24 kDa is the light chain of the anti-HA IgG used for immunoprecipitation. Similar results were obtained in four other independent experiments. C, two peptides were generated from enzymatic digestion of the 60-kDa protein which co-precipitates with HA-RhoAsn-19. Peptide 1 has the same sequence as residues 320–336 of human SmgGDS (Swiss-Prot accession number P52306). Peptide 2 has high sequence homology to residues 379–393 of human SmgGDS. The sequencing analysis indicated that the amino acids listed in the columns have an equal probability of occupying these positions in peptide 2. D, the HA antibody was used to immunoprecipitate HA-tagged RhoA (lanes 1 and 2), RhoAAsn-19 (lanes 3–5) or RhoAVal-14 (lanes 6 and 7) from equal numbers of the following 35S-labeled cells: m3WTRho-1 (lane 1), m3WTRho-11 (lane 2), m3DNRho-2 (lane 3), m3DNRho-4 (lane 4), m3DNRho-6 (lane 5), m3CARho-1 (lane 6), and m3CARho-4 (lane 7). Labels on the figure are the same as those for Fig. 2 A. Similar results were obtained in six other independent experiments. E, lysates from equal numbers of the indicated cells or from rat brain tissue were probed by ECL Western blotting using antibodies to Dbl at concentrations of 1 μg/ml (lane 1) or 0.5 μg/ml (lane 2), Ost at 0.5 μg/ml (lane 3) or 0.25 μg/ml (lane 4), Vav at 0.5 μg/ml (lane 5) or 0.25 μg/ml (lane 6), or β-catenin at 5 μg/ml (lane 7).

Enzymatic digestion and peptide sequencing of this 60-kDa protein yielded a 17-amino acid peptide identical to residues 320–336 of SmgGDS (Fig. 2 C). The high performance liquid chromatography fraction containing this peptide also contained a small amount of a secondary peptide. The sequence of this secondary peptide corresponds to residues 379–393 of SmgGDS (Fig. 2 C). These results indicate that SmgGDS is the 60-kDa protein that preferentially associates with dominant negative RhoAAsn-19. This conclusion is supported by previous reports that SmgGDS is a 61-kDa (558 amino acids) GEF that physically associates with RhoA (3.Yaku H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 4.Mizuno T. Kaibuchi K. Yamamoto T. Kawamura M. Sakoda T. Fujioka H. Matsuura Y. Takai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

SmgGDS and a 57-kDa protein preferentially co-precipitate with RhoAAsn-19 in all three sublines expressing dominant negative RhoAAsn-19 (lanes 3–5, Fig.2 D). Small amounts of these proteins also co-precipitate with HA-tagged wild-type RhoA expressed in m3WTRho-1 and m3WTRho-11 cells (lanes 1 and 2, Fig. 2 D).We found that both Dbl and Ost are expressed by m3DNRho-4 cells (Fig.2 E) and by the other CHO-m3 sublines (data not shown). Interestingly, dominant negative RhoAAsn-19 does not detectably co-precipitate with these GEFs nor with other proteins of similar relative molecular masses (95–115 kDa) (Fig. 2, Aand D). The co-precipitation of Dbl or Ost with RhoAAsn-19 was also not observed when Western blots of immunoprecipitated RhoAAsn-19 were probed with Dbl or Ost antibodies (n = 3, data not shown).Wild-type RhoA is diffusely distributed throughout the nucleus and cytoplasm, with increased localization at cell junctions and in the perinuclear area of some cells (Fig.3 A). Activated RhoAVal-14 is similarly distributed throughout the cell, although some cells appear to have greater levels of RhoAVal-14 in the nucleus compared with the cytoplasm (Fig. 3 B). This appearance may result from increased nuclear localization of RhoAVal-14 or because increased cell spreading causes a more diffuse and apparently less intense staining of cytoplasmic RhoAVal-14. Dominant negative RhoAAsn-19 is confined to the perinuclear area (Fig. 3 C). Microinjection of SmgGDS cDNA into m3WTRho-1 cells resulted in the exclusion of HA-RhoA from the nucleus and from cell-cell junctions (Fig. 3 E). In contrast, wild-type RhoA remains in the nucleus and at junctions after the cells are microinjected with Ost-α cDNA (Fig. 3 F). Microinjection of HA-Dbl cDNA into CHO-m3 cells did not alter the junctional and nuclear staining of endogenous RhoA detected by RhoA antibody (data not shown). Microinjection of buffer or GFP cDNA also did not alter the distribution of HA-RhoA or endogenous RhoA in the cells (data not shown).Figure 3HA-tagged wild-type and mutant RhoA accumulate in different intracellular locations. The HA antibody was used to immunofluorescently localize HA-tagged wild-type or mutant RhoA proteins in m3WTRho-1 cells (A), m3CARho-4 cells (B), m3DNRho-4 cells (C), m3Zeo-2 cells (D), m3WTRho-1 cells microinjected with SmgGDS cDNA (E), or m3WTRho-1 cells microinjected with Ost-α cDNA (F). Similar results were obtained in three other independent experiments.

RhoAAsn-19 also does not detectably bind GTP in the CHO-m3 sublines. This result is consistent with in vitro studies demonstrating that H-RasAsn-17 has a 40-fold lower affinity for GTP compared with that of wild-type H-Ras (16.Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). The binding of GTP by small GTPases may promote their disassociation from GEFs such as SmgGDS (6.Chuang T.-H. Xu X. Quilliam L.A. Bokoch G.M. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 761-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 26.Iouzalen N. Camonis J. Moreau J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Thus, RhoAAsn-19 may remain associated with SmgGDS because RhoAAsn-19 cannot bind GTP. These possibilities are consistent with a previously developed model suggesting that RasAsn-17 exerts a dominant negative phenotype by nonproductively associating with a GEF (16.Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 17.Farnsworth C.L. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4822-4829Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar).These findings provide an explanation for the dominant negative function of RhoAAsn-19. The association of SmgGDS with RhoAAsn-19 may prohibit SmgGDS from interacting with endogenous RhoA. This event may disrupt signaling pathways that involve the SmgGDS-dependent activation of RhoA. RhoAAsn-19 expression diminishes myosin reorganization induced by stimulating M3 mAChR in the CHO-m3 sublines (12.Strassheim D. May L.G. Varker K.A. Puhl H.L. Phelps S.H. Porter R.A. Aronstam R.S. Noti J.D. Williams C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18675-18685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It is possible that M3 mAChR stimulation cannot activate RhoA when SmgGDS is competitively bound by RhoAAsn-19, resulting in diminished myosin reorganization. We found that microinjection of SmgGDS cDNA into m3WTRho-1 cells does not mimic myosin reorganization induced by M3 mAChR stimulation (data not shown). This result is expected because M3 mAChR-mediated myosin reorganization depends upon other signals in addition to RhoA activation, including protein kinase C activation (12.Strassheim D. May L.G. Varker K.A. Puhl H.L. Phelps S.H. Porter R.A. Aronstam R.S. Noti J.D. Williams C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18675-18685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). RhoA or SmgGDS may have to be modified by mAChR-mediated signals before these proteins can participate in myosin reorganization. This possibility is consistent with a previous report that the SmgGDS-dependent activation of Rap1B is enhanced by protein kinase A activation (27.Itoh T. Kaibuchi K. Sasaki T. Takai T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 1319-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).The perinuclear distribution of dominant negative RhoAAsn-19 suggests that it accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum, late endosomes, or the Golgi apparatus. Although the co-localization of SmgGDS to this region has not been determined, other proteins that physically interact with Smg GDS, including Rap1B (28.Pizon V. Desjardins M. Bucci C. Parton R.G. Zerial M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1661-1670PubMed Google Scholar) and SMAP (29.Shimizu K. Kawabe H. Minami S. Honda T. Takaishi K. Shiratai H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27013-27017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), also accumulate in these perinuclear organelles. We found that microinjection of SmgGDS cDNA causes wild-type HA-RhoA to be excluded from the nucleus and from cell junctions. The absence of HA-RhoA from the junctions of cells overexpressing SmgGDS is consistent with previous reports that SmgGDS causes small GTPases to dissociate from plasma membranes (5.Orita S. Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S. Shimizu K. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25542-25546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Kawamura M. Kaibuchi K. Kishi K. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 832-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Previous studies indicate that signals transduced by surface receptors cause RhoA to enter the nucleus (31.Baldassare J. Jarpe M.B. Alferes L. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4911-4914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that interactions with SmgGDS may prohibit RhoA from entering the nucleus.It is somewhat surprising that dominant negative RhoAAsn-19interacts with SmgGDS but does not detectably associate with other GEFs such as Dbl or Ost. It is possible that Dbl and Ost are expressed at significantly lower levels than SmgGDS, causing the co-precipitation of RhoAAsn-19 with Dbl or Ost to be significantly less detectable than its co-precipitation with SmgGDS. We are currently addressing this possibility by comparing the expression of SmgGDS with other GEFs in the CHO-m3 cell lines.SmgGDS can activate several other small GTPases in addition to RhoAin vitro, including Rac1 (3.Yaku H.

This event would disrupt signaling pathways that involve the SmgGDS-dependent activation of these other GTPases. However, several lines of evidence suggest that the expression of RhoAAsn-19 does not inhibit the activity of GTPases different from RhoA. First, these different GTPases are believed to be selectively activated by GEFs other than SmgGDS in vivo (2.Zohn I.M. Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1415-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 6.Chuang T.-H. Xu X. Quilliam L.A. Bokoch G.M. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 761-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, the activity of these GTPases would only be minimally affected by their inability to interact with SmgGDS that is competitively bound by RhoAAsn-19. Secondly, SmgGDS is significantly more active toward RhoA than toward other GTPases (3.Yaku H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 4.Mizuno T. Kaibuchi K. Yamamoto T. Kawamura M. Sakoda T. Fujioka H. Matsuura Y. Takai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Finally, we did not detect the co-precipitation of SmgGDS with wild-type Rac1, activated Rac1Val-12, or dominant negative Rac1Asn-17stably expressed in other CHO-m3 sublines. 2C. L. Williams, unpublished data. This finding indicates that Rac1 does not interact with SmgGDS in these cells, even though Rac1 can be activated by SmgGDS in vitro (3.Yaku H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 5.Orita S. Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S. Shimizu K. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. J. Biol.

J. 1994; 303: 761-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).In contrast to dominant negative RhoAAsn-19, activated RhoAVal-14 has reduced association with both SmgGDS and RhoGDI. This result is consistent with reports that SmgGDS and RhoGDI have reduced affinity for the GTP-bound form of small GTPases (6.Chuang T.-H. Xu X. Quilliam L.A. Bokoch G.M. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 761-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 26.Iouzalen N. Camonis J. Moreau J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We did not detect any proteins that co-precipitate more effectively with RhoAVal-14 compared with wild-type RhoA. The interaction of RhoAVal-14 with potential effectors may be too labile to be detected by our immunoprecipitation techniques. Alternatively, the effectors that interact with RhoAVal-14may not be solubilized by our immunoprecipitation techniques.These findings help define how the expression of RhoAVal-14or RhoAAsn-19 alters certain signaling pathways. The predominance of RhoAVal-14 in the GTP-bound form indicates that RhoAVal-14 may activate any signaling pathway that involves RhoA activation. In contrast, the preferential interaction of RhoAAsn-19 with SmgGDS indicates that the expression of RhoAAsn-19 most likely disrupts signaling pathways that rely upon the SmgGDS-dependent activation of RhoA. Rho proteins are small GTPases that regulate actin/myosin interactions, controlling such diverse processes as cell division, migration, contraction, and adhesion (reviewed in Refs. 1.Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5184) Google Scholar and 2.Zohn I.M. Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Der C.J.

Rho is activated by associating with guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs),1 which stimulate GTP binding to Rho in exchange for GDP.

Identifying the GEFs that associate with Rho proteins in vivo will help determine how Rho activity is regulated. Dominant negative Rho mutants are used to define the signaling pathways that regulate Rho activity (12.Strassheim D. May L.G. Varker K.A. Puhl H.L. Phelps S.H. Porter R.A. Aronstam R.S. Noti J.D.

Substitution of asparagine for threonine at amino acid 19 in RhoA is believed to induce a dominant negative function because of the increased association of RhoAAsn-19 with a GEF. Competitive binding of a specific GEF by RhoAAsn-19 may inhibit the GEF from interacting with endogenous RhoA. This event would disrupt any signal transduction pathway that normally utilizes the GEF. This model of how RhoAAsn-19 induces a dominant negative phenotype is based on previous studies using mutant Ras proteins with the analogous substitution of asparagine for serine at amino acid 17 (16.Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 17.Farnsworth C.L. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4822-4829Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). These studies support the model that RasAsn-17 has a dominant negative function because it competitively binds a GEF needed for the activation of endogenous Ras (16.Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell.

Phosphoinositides, the main sources of DAG in cell signaling, contain mostly stearoyl and arachidonoyl in thesn-1 and -2 positions, respectively. The polymorphic behavior of sn-1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoylglycerol (SAG) was studied by differential scanning calorimetry, x-ray powder diffraction, and solid state magic angle spinning (MAS) 13C NMR. Three α phases were found in the dry state. X-ray diffraction indicated that the acyl chains packed in a hexagonal array in the α phase, and the two sub-α phases packed with pseudo-hexagonal symmetry. In the narrow angle range strong diffractions of ∼31 and ∼62 Å were present. High power proton-decoupled MAS 13C NMR of isotropic SAG gave 16 distinct resonances of the 20 arachidonoyl carbons and 5 distinct resonances of the 18 stearoyl carbons. Upon cooling, all resonances of stearoyl weakened and vanished in the sub-α2 phase, whereas arachidonoyl carbons from 8/9 to 20 gave distinct resonances in the frozen phases. Remarkably, the ω-carbon of the two acyl chains had different chemical shifts in α, sub-α1, and sub-α2 phases. Large differences in spin lattice relaxation of the stearoyl and arachidonoyl methene and methyl groups were demonstrated by contact time (cross-polarization) MAS 13C NMR experiments in the solid phases α, sub-α1, and sub-α2. This shows that stearoyl and arachidonoyl in SAG have different environments in the solid states (α, sub-α1, and sub-α2phases) and may segregate during cooling. The NMR and long spacing x-ray diffraction results suggest that SAG does not pack in a conventional double layer with the two acyls in a hairpin fashion. Our findings thus provide a physicochemical basis for DAG hexagonal phase domain separation within membrane bilayers. sn-1,2-Diacylglycerol (DAG), a key intermediate in lipid metabolism, activates protein kinase C and is a fusogen.

DAGs produced from glycerol 3-phosphate in the de novo glycerolipid synthesis are further converted to phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine by the choline and ethanolamine phosphotransferase reactions or converted to triacylglycerol in acyltransferase reactions (1.Vance D.E. Vance J. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1996Google Scholar). DAGs are also formed during agonist-induced cell activation from preformed glycerophospholipids directly through (phosphoinositide-specific) phospholipase C and indirectly through the combined action of phospholipase D and phosphatidate phosphohydrolase (2.Singer W.D.

Stacey D.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The phospholipid-derived (and perhaps also the de novo synthesized) DAGs are also converted by DAG kinase to phosphatidic acid which may be further converted to phosphatidylinositols, phosphatidylglycerol, and cardiolipin (1.Vance D.E. Vance J. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1996Google Scholar), or the DAGs are degraded by DAG and monoacylglycerol lipases to yield free fatty acids, of which arachidonate is utilized for eicosanoid synthesis (8.Balsinde J.

Moreover, upon thrombin stimulation of platelets many molecular species of DAG are formed, but the concomitant PKC-induced phosphorylation of pleckstrin only correlates with the transient, large accumulation of SAG, showing that at least in intact platelets the SAG species specifically activates PKC (22.Fukami M.H.

Unfortunately, none of these studies employed SAG but were mostly performed with DAGs containing the same fatty acid in both the sn-1 and thesn-2 positions, an acyl combination that is rare in biological glycerophospholipids. Evidently, SAG appears to be the molecular species of DAGs that displays several pivotal roles in cellular signal transduction and metabolism, and sn-1,2-DAGs (in general) are fusogens that may participate in many cellular processes that may involve their tendency to form separate domains and promote Lα to HII transition in membranes. It is, therefore, likely that these actions of the DAGs are due to their physical behavior. Previous differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and x-ray powder diffraction studies have shown that DAGs with the same saturated fatty acid (C12, C16, and C18) in thesn-1 and -2 positions have a stable bilayered β′ phase (34.Pascher I.

Fahey D.A. Small D.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10771-10779Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In contrast, the biologically occurringsn-1-stearoyl-2-oleoylglycerol packs with very complex chain conformations, disorder and marked polymorphism giving rise to at least eight phases in the solid state (37.Di L. Small D.M. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1611-1623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sn-1,3 isomer of this DAG, which does not participate in cellular activities, packs in four phases. In the most stable β form the acyl chains come off the glycerol backbone in a 94o V-shape (38.Goto M. Honda K. Di L. Small D.M. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2185-2191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), quite unlike the hairpin conformation typical for the acyl groups in the bilayer membrane. The naturally occurringsn-1-stearoyl-2-linoleoylglycerol packs somewhat more efficiently than the sn-2-monounsaturated DAG in α, sub-α1, sub-α2, and β′ phases with the β′ and α phases thought to have a tilted bilayer and extended bilayer structures, respectively (39.Di L. Small D.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16672-16677Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the present study we have performed similar calorimetric and x-ray experiments of SAG and complimented these with solid state high power proton decoupling and cross-polarization, magic angle spinning13C nuclear magnetic resonance studies. We find that SAG exists in α, sub-α1, sub-α2 phases but no β′ phase. However, to our surprise, our NMR results show that the stearoyl chain freezes before the arachidonoyl chain on cooling and that the terminal methyl group of the arachidonoyl chains exists in a different milieu than that of the stearoyl chains. These observations together with our finding that the average (001) strong x-ray reflections is around 62–63 Å in the α phases, in contrast to 55 Å in sn-1,2-distearoylglycerol (36.Kodali D.R. Fahey D.A. Small D.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10771-10779Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), perhaps suggest that SAG exists in a V-shaped segregated bilayer. sn-1,2-SAG (claimed to be 99% pure) were obtained from Serdary Research Laboratories (Englewood Cliffs, NJ) and were purified by flash column chromatography (under argon) on silica gel (grade 60, 230–400 mesh, Merck) containing 9% boric acid (w/w) (40.Kodall D. Duclos R. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1992; 61: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) to remove about 5% 1,3-sn-SAG and some highR f impurities (UV-sensitive). Eluting solvent (degassed under vacuum and saturated with argon) was either 5–8% ethyl acetate in hexane or 1–5% acetone in dichloromethane. Fractions were tested on boric acid-treated TLC plates (silica gel hard layer organic binder on a glass support, soaked in 5% boric acid at room temperature, air-dried overnight, and activated for 1 h at 100 °C), eluted with 5% acetone in dichloromethane. Pure fractions were combined and filtered to remove silica dust. All samples were demonstrated to be homogeneous by analytical two-dimensional TLC (boric acid-treated silica gel hard layer organic binder plates, 5% acetone in dichloromethane, visualized with cupric acid/phosphoric acid followed by charring (41.Kodali D.R. Tercyak A. Fahey D.A. Small D.M. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1990; 52: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar)) and 1H NMR (500 MHz) in CDCl3 solutions with tetramethylsilane as an internal standard. The purified sn-1,2-SAG was then kept cold and under argon to avoid isomerization (41.Kodali D.R. Tercyak A. Fahey D.A. Small D.M. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1990; 52: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and oxidation, stored either in CHCl3 (−20 °C) or dry (rotary-evaporated under reduced pressure, and lyophilized for 15 h in an ice-water bath). DSC of dry sn-1,2-SAG was carried out on a Perkin-Elmer DSC-7. Each sample (1.5–5.0 mg), weighed to the nearest 0.01 mg, was sealed (under argon) in a stainless steel pan, and a pan with argon was used as a reference sample. Heating and cooling rates were 5 °C/min. The enthalpies of melting (ΔH m) and crystallization (ΔH c) were determined by using 7 series/UNIX software. The instrument was calibrated by data obtained from high purity standard material (Indium). Estimated error margin for this standard is less than 0.5 °C in the transition temperature and 2% in enthalpy. Hydrated sn-1,2-SAG samples were made by adding different amounts of water, heating to 35 °C, and shaking for 15 min to equilibrate water with lipid. The amount of water was estimated gravimetrically. All samples were checked for hydrolysis and 1,3-acyl migration by TLC (41.Kodali D.R. Tercyak A. Fahey D.A. Small D.M. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1990; 52: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and no hydrolysis or migration was detected. X-ray powder diffraction patterns were recorded using nickel-filtered CuKα radiation from an Elliot GX-6 (Elliot Automation, Borehamwood, UK) rotating-mode generator equipped with cameras using Franks double-mirror optics (42.Franks A. Br. J. Appl. Phys. 1958; 9: 349-352Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and toroidal-mirror optics. The samples were packed into 0.7 or 1.0-mm diameter Lindeman capillaries (Charles Supper, Natick, MA), sealed, and examined in variable temperature sample holders. The rate of cooling and heating to a fixed temperature is 2–4 °C/min. The photographs were taken on a Toroid camera. The diffraction patterns were recorded using thermal programming similar to those used in the DSC investigation. High resolution 1H and 13C NMR were recorded on a Bruker 500-MHz spectrometer, and solid state13C NMR values were recorded on a Bruker AMX-300 NMR spectrometer (75 MHz for 13C) equipped with a BL7 MAS probe and a high power amplifier unit. Samples were packed under argon in 7-mm Zr2O rotors with an insert (sample volume ∼150 μl). Sample spinning rates were 4.0 kHz for solid state and 1.0 kHz in the isotropic state. The rotor was spun by dry nitrogen gas, which was cooled by liquid nitrogen. Sample temperatures are within ±1 °C with the Bruker B-VT-1000 variable temperature unit, and the probe was calibrated with respect to the transition from α phase to the isotropic phase of sn-1,2-SAG. Samples were allowed to equilibrate 20 min before data acquisition. Typical decoupling power was 50 kHz in solid state and 20 kHz in isotropic state, and a duty cycle of ≤1.5% was used for all experiments. For solid state samples, single contact cross-polarization from the 1H reservoir to13C spins was employed to increase the 13C sensitivity and to shorten the effective 13C relaxation time (43.Fyfe C.A. Fyfe C.A. Solid State NMR for Chemistry. CFC Press, Ontario, Canada1983: 180-260Google Scholar). Different contact times were used to differentiate the molecular motions. The CH group of adamantane (38.3 ppm) was used as an external chemical shift reference. For hydrated sn-1,2-SAG, water was added, and the sample was heated to 35 °C and mixed vigorously (30 min) before transferring the sample to the rotor. All samples were checked by TLC and 1H NMR (both in CD3OD and CDCl3). No sn-1,3-SAG, hydrolyzed or oxidized impurities, or trace amounts of solvents were detected. After the solid state NMR experiments, the samples were checked again, and no changes had occurred for the dry sample. Slight isomerization to sn-1,3-SAG (1%) was found for the hydrated sample after 3 days. Solvent crystallization ofsn-1,2-SAG at −20 °C in hexane, pentane, acetone, and acetonitrile all gave α phases, and no β′ phase or β phase values were obtained. The thermodynamic data for dry and hydratedsn-1,2-SAG are shown in TableI. There are three phases found for drysn-1,2-SAG as follows: α, sub-α1, and sub-α2. Fig.1 a shows that cooling (part of the region) of the melt from 35 °C will crystallize the α phase (T c = 3.3 °C). Upon further cooling α will transform to sub-α1 (−3.1 °C) and sub-α1 will transform to sub-α2(−8.8 °C). Fig. 1 b shows heating (part of the region) from −50 °C to 35 °C. Sub-α2 will transform to sub-α1 at −5.3 °C with a ΔH = 1.4 kcal/mol, and sub-α1 will transform to the α phase at −0.1 °C with ΔH = 0.5 kcal/mol. By further heating, the α phase will melt at 7.2 °C, with ΔH = 8.0 kcal/mol. Thus, α can transform to sub-α1 and then sub-α2 reversibly. Hydrated 1,2-sn-SAG also shows three phases as follows: αw, sub-α1w, and sub-α2w. Comparing with those for dry sn-1,2-SAG, both melting and transition points, and melting/transitions enthalpies for the hydrated phases are somewhat lower (∼1 °C, 1 kcal/mol). These differences are significant with respect to the precision of the measurement.Table IThermodynamic data for dry and hydrous 1,2-sn-SAG and arachidonic acidPhase/sampleTmaTemperature at melting point, transition peak value.ΔH bEnthalpy of melting.ScEntropy of melting.T cdTemperature of crystallization, transition peak temperature.°Ckcal/molcal/mol°CDrysn-SAG α7.28.028.63.3 Sub-α1ePolymorphic transition process, not melting.−0.10.51.9−3.1 Sub-α2ePolymorphic transition process, not melting.−5.31.45.4−8.8Hydrated sn-SAG αw6.87.727.43.1 Sub-αw1ePolymorphic transition process, not melting.−1.70.20.8−4.5 Sub-αw2ePolymorphic transition process, not melting.−6.31.14.2−9.5Arachidonic acid β−37.77.524.1−68.4a Temperature at melting point, transition peak value.b Enthalpy of melting.c Entropy of melting.d Temperature of crystallization, transition peak temperature.e Polymorphic transition process, not melting. Open table in a new tab Calorimetry of arachidonic acid showed that the acid melts at −37.5 °C (ΔH = 7.5 kcal/mol) and recrystallizes with marked undercooling at −68 °C (ΔH = 6.1 kcal/mol). (The DSC cooling scan of sn-1,2-SAG is shown in Fig. 1 a and heating in Fig. 1 b.) The thermodynamic data are presented in Table I. The melting point is higher than the −49.5 °C previously reported in the literature (44.Markley K.S. O'Connor R.T. Singleton W.S. Fatty Acids. 2nd Ed. Interscience Publications, New York1960: 162-164Google Scholar), possibly because the samples of this study are more pure. The long and short spacing and the relative intensities of the three phases for dry and hydratedsn-1,2-SAG are summarized in TableII. For sn-1,2-SAG the α form (1 °C) has only one strong peak (4.28 Å) in the short spacing region and a long spacing (001) of 62.1 Å. In the sub-α1phase (−4 °C) three peaks were observed (4.82 (medium), 4.33 (strong), and 4.00 (medium) Å). The long spacing of sub-α1 is 62.6 Å. In the sub-α2 phase (−10 °C) three reflections were revealed (4.78 (medium), 4.31 (very strong), and 3.84 (strong) Å). The long spacing of sub-α2 is 63.6 Å. The wide angle x-ray reflections for the hydrated state are very similar to those of the dry state phases. The difference in long spacing between the hydrated and the dry states is not significant.Table IIX-ray differaction spacing (Å) for dry and hydrous 1,2-sn-SAGαSub-α1Sub-α2αwSub-αw1Sub-αw262.1 (av)62.6 (av)63.6 (av)60.9 (av)61.0 (av)62.9 (av)62.2 (s), 162.8 (vs)63.5 (vs), 160.8 (m), 160.2 (s), 162.2 (s), 130.9 (s), 231.4 (vs), 231.8 (vs), 230.4 (m), 230.9 (s), 231.8 (s), 220.8 (w), 320.8 (w), 315.5 (m), 415.6 (m), 415.9 (w), 4 4.82 (m), 4.78 (m) 4.80 (m) 4.76 (w)4.28 (s) 4.33 (s) 4.31 (vs) 4.29 (m) 4.34 (s) 4.29 (s) 4.00 (m) 3.83 (s) 3.96 (m) 3.83 (m)Av., average 001 spacing calculated from all the orders.

The order of 001 reflection is indicated after the diffraction long spacing intensity. These diffraction spacings indicate that in the α form the chains are packed in the usual hexagonal packing. However, the diffraction peak of 4.28 Å is a little larger than the usual 4.1–4.2 Å spacing seen in most saturated and monounsaturated lipids. This may indicate that the chain packing is in general a bit more disordered than those with no or few C=Cs between the chains. The two sub-α phases, sub-α1 and sub-α2, form a distorted, hexagonal chain packing which also might be described as a somewhat disordered, two-dimensional rectangular packing of the chains. The nature of the two sub-α phase transformations is probably a disorder to order process involving conversion of some gauche or skewed bonds to trans-conformation as the temperature is lowered. Since the enthalpies of this α to sub-α1 and sub-α1to sub-α2 transitions are small, one can estimate that around 15–20% of the gauche bonds in the α form have been transformed to trans bonds in the sub-α1 form. The average (001) reflections of the α and sub-α phases are 62.1 to 63.6 Å. The α phase of sn-1,2-distearoylglycerol is about 55 Å. In this phase the chains were presumed to be nearly perpendicular to the bilayer plane. This structure is based on the (001) diffractions of a homologous series of saturated chainsn-1,2-di(iso)acylglycerols (36.Kodali D.R. Fahey D.A. Small D.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10771-10779Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This gives an increment of about 1.27 Å per carbon. We have noted that the α phase ofsn-1-stearoyl-2-linoleoylglycerol (SLG) is 59.5 Å, thus significantly greater than the distearoyl analog. We argued (38.Goto M. Honda K. Di L. Small D.M. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2185-2191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the most likely packing of the chains in the α phase was a bilayer with extended acyl chains and an extended glycerol lying perpendicular to the plane of the bilayer. The argument that SLG α phase is a bilayer was bolstered by the fact that the phases hydrate with half a molecule of water that increases the spacing by almost 2 Å. The spacings of the sn-1,2-SAG are about 2 Å longer than the linoleoyl analog and could be consistent with a similar structure, that is a bilayer with extended chains and the glycerol and itssn-1 ester group lying perpendicular to the plane of the bilayer. However, sn-1,2-SAG with water shows no significant change in long spacing and thus appears not to swell with minor hydration. We emphasize, however, that without a true crystalline structure it is difficult to be certain about the meaning of the (001) spacings. In fact, as we noted with the SLG, the intensity distribution in the first, second, and third order do not follow an ordinary bilayer distribution, since the (002) reflection is quite strong. This is also true in the sn-1,2-SAG spacings. Data in this paper may suggest a chain segregated model. Liquidsn-1,2-SAG was put in a capillary cylinder (8 μl/cm, Wilmad) mixed with water (30% by volume), and sealed. The contents were mixed vigorously by centrifugation. The capillary cylinder with sample was then inserted in a 5-mm NMR tube containing CDCl3/tetramethylsilane. Comparison of 1H NMR spectra between the neat liquid of sn-1,2-SAG andsn-1,2-SAG/water at 20 °C shows that there is an extra peak at 4.64 ppm (equivalent to 1 proton), which is different from the unbound water (spectra not shown). Therefore, on a time average, everysn-1,2-SAG molecule binds to half a water molecule in the liquid state. The free –OH group of sn-1,2-SAG shifts from 4.21 to 4.04 ppm upon forming a water complex. 13C NMR shows that the chemical shifts changes for the sn-3-glycerol carbon, –CH2-OH, and thesn-2-glycerol carbon, CH2-OCO–, shifts upfield by 0.09 ppm after forming hydrated product. The13C resonances of the two carbonyl groups (C=O) shift downfield by 0.14 ppm (sn-1) and 0.17 ppm (sn-2). These changes in"
https://openalex.org/W2157499968,"Abstract The transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) comprises two structurally related subunits, TAP1 and TAP2, that form stable complexes in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes. TAP complexes function in the translocation of peptides from the cytosol into the ER lumen for presentation by major histocompatibility complex class I molecules. Each TAP subunit contains an N-terminal membrane-spanning region with multiple membrane-spanning segments, and a C-terminal, cytosolic nucleotide binding region. To study the nature of the interactions occurring on the cytosolic face of TAP1/TAP2 complexes, we investigated quaternary associations mediated by two C-terminal fragments of human TAP1 (T1c, residues 452–748 and T1ctr, residues 472–748) and two C-terminal fragments of human TAP2 (T2c, residues 399–686 and T2ctr, residues 433–686). Each of these constructs contains the core nucleotide binding region as well as a long or short N-terminal extension. We show stable complex formation between T1c and T2c but not between T1ctr and T2ctr. The mechanistic implications of these results are discussed. We also show that each of the constructs except T1ctr interacts with wild type TAP1 and TAP2, indicating possibilities for homodimerization of TAP1 and TAP2, or of oligomerization of TAP1/TAP2 heterodimers on membranes."

We used representational difference analysis to identify genes that are expressed differentially during myeloid differentiation of EML cells. One gene (namedmAKRa) encoded a novel member of the aldoketo reductase (AKR) superfamily of cytosolic NAD(P)(H)-dependent oxidoreductases. mAKRa mRNA was detected in murine hematopoietic tissues including bone marrow, spleen, and thymus. In myeloid cell lines, mAKRa was expressed at highest levels in cells representative of promyelocytes. mAKRa mRNA levels increased rapidly in response to interleukin-3 over the first 24 h of EML cell differentiation when the cells undergo lineage commitment and extensive proliferation. mAKRa mRNA levels decreased later in the differentiation process particularly when the EML cells were cultured with granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor and retinoic acid to induce terminal granulocytic maturation. mAKRa mRNA levels decreased during retinoic acid-induced terminal granulocytic differentiation of the MPRO promyelocyte cell line. AKRs act as molecular switches by catalyzing the interconversion or inactivation of bioactive molecules including steroids and prostaglandins.

The mature cells have relatively short lifespans and must be repopulated continuously from the pool of PHSC. Hematopoietic differentiation is a highly regulated process, and a growing number of regulatory molecules have been identified which are involved both in the normal differentiation process and also in the aberrant hematopoiesis seen in leukemia and other hematological disorders. For example, the hematopoietic growth factors recognize specific receptors on the surface of subsets of hematopoietic cells at different stages of development and stimulate their further differentiation, proliferation, and/or survival (1.Metcalf D. Blood. 1993; 82: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, many transcriptional regulators have been identified which are expressed in cell-specific patterns in hematopoietic cells and which are directly associated with hematopoietic differentiation or leukemia (2.Tenen D.G. Hromas R. Licht J.D. Zhang D.E. Blood. 1997; 90: 489-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Shivdasani R.A. Orkin S.H. Blood. 1996; 87: 4025-4039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another class of factors which modulates hematopoiesis consists of small biologically active molecules such as retinoids, particularly retinoic acid (4.Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6341) Google Scholar), prostaglandins, and steroids (5.Broxmeyer H.E. Williams D.E. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1988; 8: 173-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 6.Dupuis F. Desplat V. Praloran V. Denizot Y. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1997; 16: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). With the notable exception of retinoic acid, which acts as a ligand for a family of nuclear hormone receptors, the mechanisms of action of such molecules are poorly understood. One model is that such molecules may act as autocrine or intracrine regulators of hematopoietic commitment, proliferation, and terminal maturation; thus, the identification of enzymes that catalyze the synthesis or catabolism of these molecules in hematopoietic cells is of great interest. Recently, for example, a member of a superfamily of intracellular oxidoreductases, the aldoketo reductases (AKRs), has been implicated in the synthesis of autocrine factors that may interfere with retinoic acid signaling during granulocytic differentiation (7.Mills K.I. Gilkes A.F. Sweeney M. Choudhry M.A. Woodgate L.J. Bunce C.M. Brown G. Burnett A.K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Various techniques have been used to identify genes that encode regulators of hematopoietic differentiation. For example, genetic studies in mice revealed critical lineage-specific roles for transcriptional regulators such as C/EBPα (8.Zhang D.E. Zhang P. Wang N.D. Hetherington C.J. Darlington G.J. Tenen D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar), GATA-1 (9.Pevny L. Lin C.S. D'Agati V. Simon M.C. Orkin S.H. Costantini F.

Science. 1994; 265: 1573-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar), and many others (3.Shivdasani R.A. Orkin S.H. Blood. 1996; 87: 4025-4039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Ness S.A. Engel J.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 718-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Elucidation of the genetic alterations underlying certain leukemias, including chromosomal translocations and more subtle mutations, has revealed the hematopoietic functions of proteins such as PLZF and AML-1 (3.Shivdasani R.A. Orkin S.H. Blood. 1996; 87: 4025-4039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, new techniques have been developed to identify genes that are expressed differentially in two cell populations, including PCR-based methods such as differential display (12.Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4707) Google Scholar) and representational difference analysis (RDA) (13.Lisitsyn N. Lisitsyn N. Wigler M. Science. 1993; 259: 946-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar, 14.Hubank M. Schatz D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5640-5648Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). These advances have permitted the description of additional genes whose expression is regulated during hematopoiesis (15.Iwama A. Zhang P. Darlington G.J. McKercher S.R. Maki R. Tenen D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3034-3043Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 16.Lawson N.D. Berliner N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The relative scarcity of PHSCs in bone marrow (0.01–0.005% of nucleated cells) and the difficulty in isolating pure populations of cells at specific stages of differentiation have hampered the molecular analysis of hematopoietic development (2.Tenen D.G. Hromas R. Licht J.D. Zhang D.E. Blood. 1997; 90: 489-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To address this problem, cell lines representative of different stages of hematopoietic differentiation have been established over the past few decades. In certain cases, including the human HL-60 (18.Breitman T.R. Selonick S.E. Collins S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2936-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (1864) Google Scholar) and murine 32DCl.3 (19.Valtieri M. Tweardy D.J. Caracciolo D. Johnson K. Mavilio F. Altmann S. Santoli D. Rovera G. J.

Physiol. 1969; 74: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) cell lines, differentiation may be regulated in culture permitting the analysis of the role of putative regulatory genes. Shortcomings of these studies have included the leukemic origin of many immortalized cell lines and their limited differentiative capacity. A pair of recently established murine cell lines, named EML and MPRO, permit the analysis of hematopoietic development over the whole spectrum of differentiation from the pluripotent progenitor cell to terminally differentiated granulocytes and macrophages (21.Tsai S. Collins S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7153-7157Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 22.Tsai S. Bartelmez S. Sitnicka E. Collins S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The EML cell line was established by forcing expression of a dominant negative retinoic acid receptor α (RARα) molecule in murine bone marrow cells and subsequently selecting cells that were dependent on stem cell factor (SCF) for survival (22.Tsai S. Bartelmez S. Sitnicka E. Collins S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The resulting cell line expresses many markers of hematopoietic progenitor cells (Linlo, c-Kit+, Sca-1+) (23.Li C.L. Johnson G.R. Blood. 1995; 85: 1472-1479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and grows continuously in the presence of stem cell factor. Although a limited number of prepro-B cells and erythroid progenitors arise spontaneously in culture, myeloid differentiation is inhibited by the dominant negative RARα. This block can be overcome by culturing in the presence of the multifunctional cytokine interleukin-3 (IL-3) and pharmacological doses of all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) (17.Weiler S.R. Gooya J.M. Ortiz M. Tsai S. Collins S.J. Keller J.R. Blood. 1999; 93: 527-536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,22.Tsai S. Bartelmez S. Sitnicka E. Collins S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, EML cells differentiate into promyelocytes over a period of 6–7 days, and differentiation-specific genes are expressed in patterns similar to those seen in bona fidehematopoietic progenitors (17.Weiler S.R. Gooya J.M. Ortiz M. Tsai S. Collins S.J. Keller J.R. Blood. 1999; 93: 527-536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Williams S.C. Du Y. Schwartz R.C. Weiler S.R. Ortiz M. Keller J.R. Johnson P.F. J.

Terminal granulocytic differentiation can be achieved by removing IL-3 after 3 days and replacing it with granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (22.Tsai S. Bartelmez S. Sitnicka E. Collins S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 25.Lawson N.D. Krause D.S. Berliner N. Exp. Hematol. 1998; 26: 1178-1185PubMed Google Scholar). In this system, IL-3 promotes the survival and expansion of cells committed to the myeloid and other lineages (17.Weiler S.R. Gooya J.M. Ortiz M. Tsai S. Collins S.J. Keller J.R. Blood. 1999; 93: 527-536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,22.Tsai S. Bartelmez S. Sitnicka E. Collins S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). atRA appears to act at two separate stages, first in combination with IL-3 to promote the appearance of early myeloid progenitors and second in combination with GM-CSF to promote the terminal maturation of committed granulocyte/monocyte progenitors (22.Tsai S. Bartelmez S. Sitnicka E. Collins S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 26.Purton L.E. Bernstein I.D. Collins S.J. Blood. 1999; 94: 483-495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The MPRO cell line was established using the same dominant negative RARα as EML but is arrested at the promyelocyte stage of granulocytic differentiation (21.Tsai S. Collins S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7153-7157Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar,22.Tsai S. Bartelmez S. Sitnicka E. Collins S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). MPRO cells are GM-CSF-dependent, and terminal granulocytic differentiation is induced using high levels of atRA. Using these two cell lines, it should be possible to identify genes involved at various stages of granulocytic differentiation. In this study we sought to identify genes that are activated during the initial stages of myeloid differentiation by using RDA to isolate genes whose expression is elevated 72 h after the addition of IL-3 and atRA to the EML culture. This time point was chosen because although many cells have become committed to the myeloid lineage at this stage, as measured by their responsiveness to GM-CSF (17.Weiler S.R. Gooya J.M. Ortiz M. Tsai S. Collins S.J. Keller J.R. Blood. 1999; 93: 527-536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), few cells have reached terminal maturation (25.Lawson N.D. Krause D.S. Berliner N. Exp. Hematol. 1998; 26: 1178-1185PubMed Google Scholar). We identified a novel member of the AKR superfamily and named it mouse aldoketo reductase a (mAKRa). Based on its expression pattern in EML and MPRO cells, and the ability of AKRs to metabolize molecules such as prostaglandins and steroids, we propose that it may function in the synthesis or catabolism of autocrine/intracrine factors that regulate myeloid differentiation. BHK-MKL, BHK-HM5, L (fibroblast), and NIH 3T3 (fibroblast) cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Atlanta Biological, Norcross, GA). P388 (pre-B lymphoblast), P388D1(IL-1) (macrophage), M1 (myeloblast), WEHI-3 (myelomonocyte), and IC-21 (macrophage) cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 5% FBS. 32DCl.3 (myeloblast), FDCP-1 (myeloid progenitor), and NFS-58 (promyelocyte) cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 plus 5% FBS supplemented with 20% WEHI-3 conditioned medium (CM) as a source of IL-3. M-NFS-60 (promyelocyte) cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS and 10% L cell CM as a source of macrophage colony-stimulating factor. GG2EE (macrophage) and WEHI 274.1 (monocyte) cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS. MPRO cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS and 10% BHK-HM5 CM as a source of GM-CSF. EML and EPRO cells were maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 20% horse serum (Atlanta Biological) and 10% BHK-MKL CM (as a source of SCF) or 10% BHK-HM5 CM, respectively. Myeloid differentiation of EML cells was initiated by plating at 1 × 105 cells/ml in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 20% horse serum, 10% WEHI-3 CM, 10% BHK-MKL CM, and 1 × 10−5m atRA (Sigma) for a 6-day period. Terminal granulocytic differentiation was induced by washing cells after 72 h in culture under the conditions described above and replating in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 20% horse serum, 10% BHK-HM5 CM, and 1 × 10−5m atRA. Terminal granulocytic differentiation of MPRO cells was initiated by replating cells in fresh medium containing 1 × 10−5m atRA. In all differentiation experiments cells were fed with fresh medium after 48 h and every 24 h thereafter. Cells were harvested at various times for RNA preparation. Cellular RNA was prepared from mouse tissues and cell lines using a modified guanidine isothiocyanate/phenol extraction procedure and analyzed as described previously (27.Nalbant D. Williams S.C. Stocco D.M. Khan S.A. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Northern blots were analyzed on a Molecular Dynamics 445SI PhosphorImager for quantitation of relative mRNA levels. mAKRa mRNA levels were calculated after normalization to the level of glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA. The mAKRa probe was a DpnII fragment that was isolated in the RDA procedure (see below), and the GAPDH probe was a 200-bp fragment amplified by PCR using the following oligonucleotide primers: GAPDH 5′-AAGGTCGGAGTCAACGGATT, and GAPDH 3′-TTGATGACAAGCTTCCCGTT (24.Williams S.C.

The C/EBPε probe was an 850-bp NcoI/HindIII fragment containing the entire murine cDNA (24.Williams S.C. Du Y. Schwartz R.C. Weiler S.R. Ortiz M. Keller J.R. Johnson P.F. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5640-5648Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar) was carried out to identify genes expressed at higher levels in EML cells cultured in the presence of IL-3 and atRA for 72 h versus unstimulated EML cells. Briefly, total RNA was prepared from EML cells cultured in the presence of SCF or in the presence of SCF, IL-3, and atRA, and poly(A)+ RNA was isolated using the poly(A) spin mRNA isolation kit (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 4 μg of poly(A)+ RNA using a cDNA synthesis kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). Three rounds of RDA were performed using R-Bgl-12, R-Bgl-24, J-Bgl-12, J-Bgl-24, N-Bgl-12, and N-Bgl-24 adaptors and primers described previously (13.Lisitsyn N. Lisitsyn N. Wigler M. Science. 1993; 259: 946-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar, 14.Hubank M. Schatz D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5640-5648Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). The cDNAs described above were digested with DpnII and ligated to the R-Bgl adaptors. Representations were synthesized by 23 cycles of PCR amplification of the R-ligated cDNA fragments using the R-Bgl-24 oligonucleotide.DpnII digestion of the representation derived from EML cells cultured in the presence of SCF alone generated driver cDNA. Tester cDNA was prepared by DpnII digestion of the representation derived from EML cells cultured in the presence of SCF, IL-3, and atRA for 72 h followed by ligation of J-Bgl adaptors. The first subtractive hybridization was performed combining 40 μg of driver cDNA and 0.4 μg of tester cDNA (tester:driver = 1:100). An aliquot of the hybridization mix was amplified by PCR using the J-Bgl-24 primer. The PCR products were then digested with mung bean nuclease (New England Biolabs) at 30 °C for 35 min to remove single-stranded products. The first difference products (DP1) were prepared by a further 18 cycles of PCR amplification of the digested PCR products. The procedure was repeated twice using different adaptors and tester:driver ratios to obtain DP2 (1:800) and DP3 (1:400,000). DPs were visualized on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels, excised, and subcloned into dephosphorylated BamHI-digested vector. Eight unique clones were isolated, and six of these displayed the expected differential expression pattern in EML cells. 2Y. Du and S. C. Williams, manuscript in preparation. Data-base searches with the sequence of one subclone (1603) revealed that it encoded a portion of a protein related to members of the AKR superfamily (28.Jez J.M. Bennett M.J. Schlegel B.P. Lewis M. Penning T.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). The initial clone contained the coding sequence for 86 amino acids at the COOH terminus of the protein. Two rounds of nested 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) reactions were carried out to isolate the 5′ end of the cDNA. 5′-RACE was carried out on Marathon-Ready cDNA from mouse spleen using the Advantage cDNA PCR kit (both from CLONTECH) as described previously (24.Williams S.C. Du Y. Schwartz R.C. Weiler S.R. Ortiz M. Keller J.R. Johnson P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13493-13501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The primers used for 5′-RACE reactions were: primer 1, CAG AAA TGA TGA TGT TTC CAT TCA CCA G; and nested primer, CAG GCA GAA GTC ATG ATT AGG TC. The resulting cDNA products were subcloned into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI). All subclones were sequenced at the Texas Tech University Biotechnology Institute using an Applied Biosystems Inc. Prism Genetic Analyzer 310 (Perkin-Elmer). Sequence analysis was carried out using the OMIGA and Genetics Computer Group (GCG) suite of software packages (Oxford Molecular Group Inc., Campbell, CA). Data-base searches were carried out using the FASTA program from GCG and the XREFdb data base (29.Bassett Jr., D.E. Boguski M.S. Spencer F. Reeves R. Goebl M. Hieter P. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 372-373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments were generated using the PILEUP program from GCG, and pairwise comparisons for identity calculations were performed using the BESTFIT program from GCG with a gap creation penalty of 8 and a gap extension penalty of 2. RDA is a recently developed technique that combines the selective power of subtractive hybridization with the sensitivity of PCR to isolate cDNAs representing genes that are expressed differentially in two cell populations (14.Hubank M. Schatz D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5640-5648Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). Our experimental approach was designed to identify genes that encode potential regulators of the myeloid differentiation process, rather than genes expressed in terminally differentiated neutrophils and/or macrophages. Therefore, we used RDA to isolate cDNA clones that were expressed more robustly in EML cells 72 h after the addition of IL-3 and atRA versus unstimulated cells. At least eight distinct bands representing potential differentially expressed genes were evident after three rounds of RDA (Fig. 1). Six of these bands representedbona fide differentially expressed genes as assessed by Northern blotting (data not shown). Sequence analysis identified genes known to be expressed in mature myeloid cells (lysozyme), genes encoding enzymes involved in serotonin and histamine biosynthesis, and two genes whose identity is currently unknown. 2Y. Du and S. C. Williams, manuscript in preparation. However, this report will focus on the gene represented by the most intense band in the DP3 lane (indicated with an arrow in Fig. 1 A,lane 5). After subcloning, this band was used to probe an RNA blot comparing treated and untreated EML RNA samples. A single mRNA species of approximately 1400 nucleotides was detected in both EML samples, and the level of this mRNA was 12–16-fold higher in EML at 72 h versus 0 h (Fig. 1 B). The cDNA clone was sequenced and found to contain an 86-amino acid open reading frame. Comparison with sequences in public data bases revealed that the encoded protein had not been deposited previously and that it displayed significant sequence similarity to multiple members of the AKR superfamily. The AKRs are cytosolic enzymes that catalyze the NAD(P)(H)-dependent reduction of a variety of carbonyl compounds, including molecules implicated as regulators of hematopoietic differentiation such as steroids and prostaglandins (28.Jez J.M. Bennett M.J. Schlegel B.P. Lewis M. Penning T.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar,30.Jez J.M. Flynn T.G. Penning T.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). To gain some insight into the identity and potential functions of mAKRa, we characterized the full-length cDNA and determined the relatedness of the mAKRa polypeptide to other AKR family members. The complete mAKRa sequence has been deposited in GenBank under accession numberAF177041 and is depicted in Fig. 2. The 1108-nucleotide mAKRa cDNA includes 34 bases from the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) and 105 bases from the 3′-UTR. The longest open reading frame encodes a protein of 323 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 38,000 and a pI of 6.6. A new nomenclature has been introduced recently for the AKR superfamily which assigns names to proteins based on their level of sequence similarity to other family members, and this information can be useful in predicting potential substrates (30.Jez J.M. Flynn T.G. Penning T.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). By carrying out pairwise comparisons between mAKRa and proteins representative of the seven families of AKRs, we determined that mAKRa is likely to be a member of the AKR1 family (data not shown). The AKR1 family is divided further into subfamilies (30.Jez J.M. Flynn T.G. Penning T.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), and Fig. 3 shows the alignment of mAKRa and representatives of four of the five subfamilies within the AKR1 subfamily, namely AKR1C9 (3α-HSD) (31.Pawlowski J.E. Huizinga M. Penning T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8820-8825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), AKR1D2 (rat D4–3-ketosteroid 5β-reductase (32.Onishi Y. Noshiro M. Shimosato T. Okuda K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 283: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar)), AKR1B4 (rat aldose reductase (33.Carper D. Nishimura C. Shinohara T. Dietzchold B. Wistow G. Craft C. Kador P. Kinoshita J.H. FEBS Lett. 1987; 220: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar)), and AKR1A3 (rat aldehyde reductase (34.Takahashi M. Fujii J. Teshima T. Suzuki K. Shiba T. Taniguchi N. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 127: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar)). In addition, this comparison includes three relatively uncharacterized AKR proteins (rat aldoketo reductase (RAK)b, RAKd, and RAKf) that were originally identified based on their cross-reactivity to antisera raised against rat 3α-HSD (35.Qin K. Cheng K.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3223-3228Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This alignment highlights amino acid differences between mAKRa and each of the other proteins, and it can be seen that mAKRa is most similar to the three RAK proteins than to the more characterized family members. Previous studies have identified 19 amino acids that are either totally or highly conserved within the AKR superfamily (28.Jez J.M. Bennett M.J. Schlegel B.P. Lewis M. Penning T.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). These positions are shaded in this alignment showing that 18 of the 19 residues are conserved in mAKRa. The only exception is residue 276, which is an arginine in most AKRs but is a glutamic acid in mAKRa. Membership in an AKR subfamily is defined at the 60% sequence identity level (30.Jez J.M. Flynn T.G. Penning T.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). To determine whether mAKRa defines a new subfamily in the AKR1 family or is a novel member of an existing subfamily a dendrogram was constructed which displayed the degree of sequence identity among the eight proteins shown above (Fig. 4). As expected from the alignment in Fig. 3, mAKRa was most similar to the three RAK proteins, sharing between 87 and 92% identity. mAKRa (and each of the RAK proteins) shared between 64 and 67% sequence identity with AKR1C9 (3α-HSD) but less than 60% identity with each of the other three proteins (AKR1D2 (49–51%), AKR1B4 (48–49%), and AKR1A3 (42–43%)). Similar levels of sequence identity were observed in comparing mAKRa with other members of each of these subfamilies (data not shown), indicating that mAKRa, along with the three RAK proteins, form a highly related group within the AKR1C subfamily. Having shown that mAKRa was a novel member of the AKR superfamily, we carried out RNA blot analyses to identify tissues and cell types that express mAKRa mRNA. In a survey of mouse tissues prepared from fetal (14 days postcoitum) and adult animals, mAKRa mRNA was detected at high levels in fetal and adult liver and at low levels in adult kidney (Fig.5 A). Fetal liver is primarily a hematopoietic tissue at 14 days postcoitum, suggesting that mAKRa is expressed in normal hematopoietic cells. mAKRa-specific signals were also detected at lower levels in adult bone marrow, thymus, and spleen (Fig. 5 B) but were undetectable in fetal lung and adult heart and brain. Because the EML differentiation protocol used to isolate mAKRa causes differentiation along the myeloid lineage, we examined mAKRa expression in hematopoietic cell lines to test whether it is expressed in a lineage- or stage"

These made possible chemical shift assignments of imino protons and determination of the thermal stability of the tRNATrp molecules. Almost all of the imino protons in the helical regions and the tertiary base pairs were assigned, except three imino protons of the AU base pairs whose peaks were not clearly observed. Several base triplets found in the crystal structure of tRNA were observed in the present study as well. These studies also revealed two components of tRNATrp, which could not be separated by high pressure liquid chromatography, corresponding to s4U and U at position 8 of the tRNATrp, as indicated by two different sets of peaks for the TψC and D arms. The modification at position 8 altered the local conformation of the core region of the tRNA. Thermal unfolding experiments showed that the unfolding process is cooperative in the presence of a high concentration of magnesium ions and that the component corresponding to the s4U8 is more stable than the U8 component, thus providing evidence that the thiolation of U8 stabilizes the tertiary structure of tRNA. 15N-Labeled Bacillus subtilis tRNATrp wild type and a series of mutants were hyperexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified for NMR studies with the use of two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) and heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) and three-dimensional NOESY-HSQC techniques.

Although all tRNAs have similar shapes in order to fit properly to the ribosome, they each have distinct structural features that allow accurate recognition by their cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases to ensure faithful translation in accordance to the genetic code (1.Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2747-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To understand the detailed mechanisms of the biochemical steps involved requires knowledge of the structures of tRNAs and their complexes at atomic resolution. Efforts in the past 20 years have resulted in obtaining crystal structures of several tRNAs (2.Kim S.H. Quigley G.J. Suddath F.L. McPherson A. Sneden D. Kim J.J. Weinzierl J. Rich A.

Science. 1991; 252: 1682-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, due to its large molecular weight, there has been no single solution structure of tRNA established until now. As a powerful tool for structural determination of biomolecules in solution, NMR has long been used to study the structure of tRNAs (10.Schimmel P.R. Redfield A.G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1980; 9: 181-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 11.Reid B.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 969-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). As we know, tRNAs have cloverleaf-shaped secondary structures (12.Holley R.W. Apgar J. Everett G.A. Madison J.T. Marquisee M. Merill S.H. Penswick J.R. Zamir A. Science. 1965; 147: 1462-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar), and there are many base pairs in the arms. In each base pair, there is at least one imino proton that is hydrogen-bonded to another base. It is possible to study the structures of tRNAs by observing the spectrum of imino protons whose chemical shifts are well separated from those of other protons. By using the nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE),1 the imino protons of many tRNAs have been assigned (13.Sanchez V. Redfield A.G. Johnston P.D. Tropp J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5659-5662Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 14.Roy S. Redfield A.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 7073-7083Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 15.Hare D.R. Ribeiro N.S. Wemmer D.E. Reid B.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4300-4306Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Based on the assignments, the thermal stability of these molecules was studied. It is difficult to assign these imino protons in the spectra because of the overlapping of signals and paucity of direct evidence. Stable isotope labeling is an effective method to solve the problem of spectral overlapping. With the incorporation of 15N into tRNAs, multidimensional NMR can be employed to facilitate spectral assignments and to study interactions of tRNAs with cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and other enzymes (16.Niimi T.

Dardel F. Blanquet S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7668-7677Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Among the tRNAs, it is particularly difficult to obtain a large amount of tRNATrp for physical and enzymatic studies due to its low content in cells (18.Ikemura T. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1985; 2: 13-34PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the Bacillus subtilistRNATrp gene has been cloned and hyperexpressed inEscherichia coli, and with this heterologous hyperexpression system 28% of total tRNA can be obtained in the form of tRNATrp (19.Xue H. Shen W. Wong J.T. J. Chromatogr. 1993; 613: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The hyperexpressed tRNATrplargely adopts the base modification pattern of E. colitRNATrp (20.Xue H.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The identity elements of this tRNA have been determined (22.Xue H. Shen W. Giege R. Wong J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9316-9322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to understand its structural features, we uniformly labeled the tRNATrp with15N. Wild type and mutant tRNAs were studied by proton and15N multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. Imino protons in hydrogen-bonded base pairs, including several tertiary base pairs, were assigned. The thermal stability of tRNATrp was also analyzed. Two components with different base modifications endowed with different thermal stability can be distinguished. B. subtilistRNATrp was hyperexpressed in E. coli and purified as described by Xue et al. (19.Xue H. Shen W. Wong J.T. J. Chromatogr. 1993; 613: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, E. coli JM109 cells, transformed by recombinant pGEM-9Zf (−)-derived plasmid containing synthetic B. subtilis tRNATrpgene between the SfiI and HindIII sites, were grown in M9-glycerol medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. When the cells reached an absorbance of about 0.15 at 600 nm, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mm. About 4 h later, the cells were harvested by centrifugation. Total tRNAs were prepared by phenol extraction and further purified using a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column. Purification of tRNATrp was achieved by HPLC using a 250 × 10 mm Vydac C4-derivatized silica column. Peaks I and II were pooled separately and precipitated by ethanol.15N-Labeled tRNATrp samples were prepared as above except that NH4Cl was replaced by15NH4Cl (Isotec Inc.) in the M9-glycerol minimal medium. For the NMR experiments, the samples were dissolved in a buffer containing 10 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mmsodium chloride, and 10 mm MgCl2, pH 6.5, and then concentrated and washed three times using a Centracon-10 concentrator (Amicon). The final volumes of the samples were about 0.5 ml with 25 μl of D2O added. Sample concentrations were 1–2 mm in tRNA. A small amount of 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid was added as an internal reference for proton chemical shift. All the NMR experiments were performed on Varian INOVA 500 and 750 spectrometers. One-dimensional NMR spectra were recorded using jump-and-return sequence (23.Plateau P. Gueron M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 7310-7311Crossref Scopus (1139) Google Scholar) to suppress water signal, with the carrier on the water frequency and the delay set to yield the maximum intensity at the middle of the imino proton region. Phase-sensitive two-dimensional NOESY spectra were recorded at 30 °C with the hypercomplex method (24.States D.J. Harberkon R.A. Ruben D.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 48: 286-292Google Scholar) for quadrature detection in the F1 dimension. 256 t 1 increments were recorded over a spectral width of 12,000 Hz, each with 4096 data points and a mixing time of 120 ms. Solvent suppression was achieved by replacing the third pulse by the jump-and-return sequence, with the carrier and delay set as in the one-dimensional experiments. Sensitivity-enhanced gradient two-dimensional1H-15N HSQC spectra (25.Kay L.E. Keifer P. Saarinen T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10663-10665Crossref Scopus (2421) Google Scholar) were recorded at 30 °C. Spectral widths at the proton and nitrogen dimensions were 12,000 and 6000 Hz, respectively. A total of 128t 1 increments were acquired, each with 2048 points. Three-dimensional NOESY-HSQC spectra were also recorded using a gradient sensitivity-enhanced version (26.Zhang O. Kay L.E. Olivier J.P. Forman-Kay J.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 845-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar) with NOESY mixing time of 70 ms. The size of the data set was 512 × 128 × 32 complex points. The spectral widths were 3041 Hz for the nitrogen dimension and 12,000 Hz for both proton dimensions. Data were processed using NMR pipe (27.Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11438) Google Scholar). Linear prediction method (28.Zhu G. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 90: 405-410Google Scholar) was used in both non-acquisition dimensions to improve resolution. Variable temperature experiments were carried out on Varian INOVA 750 spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance probe. In tRNA, the imino protons in each base pair can be observed in the proton spectrum in the low field region. Two-dimensional NOESY, two-dimensional1H-15N HSQC, and three-dimensional NOESY-HSQC experiments were employed to assign these imino protons. There is little difference between wild type and A73 mutant spectra (Fig.1, B and C) except for the relative intensities of some peaks owing to the different percentages of a minor form in the sample, as discussed below. The peaks in the spectrum were labeled with their positions in sequence. Some imino groups with degenerate proton chemical shifts, but different nitrogen chemical shifts, were clearly observable in the HSQC spectrum of A73 mutant (Fig. 2).Figure 2Sensitivity-enhanced15N-1H HSQC spectrum of B. subtilis tRNATrp A73 mutant at 30 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The GU wobble pairs in this tRNA provided a suitable starting point for the chemical shift assignments of the imino protons, because the two imino protons in GU pairs appear at the up-field part of the imino proton spectral region and give rise to strong mutual NOE cross-peaks (29.Johnston P.D. Redfield R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 3913-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the two-dimensional NOESY spectrum of tRNATrp (Fig. 3), there were strong mutual NOE cross-peaks between peaks at 12.15 and 9.75 ppm and 11.33 and 10.00 ppm, respectively, which were assigned to the two GU pairs, G22-U13 and G51-U63 as shown in the cloverleaf structure of tRNATrp (Fig. 1 A). The peak at 14.69 ppm was assigned to s4U8, which comes from one of the two conserved reversed Hoogsteen pairs in the tRNA tertiary structure (10.Schimmel P.R. Redfield A.G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1980; 9: 181-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), namely T54-A58 and s4U8-A14 in tRNATrp, according to its special nitrogen chemical shift at 181.0 ppm (30.Griffey R.H. Davis D.R. Yamazumi Z. Nishimura S. Hawkins B.L. Poulter C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12074-12078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It gave rise to a rather strong NOE at 12.15 ppm and a weaker one at 9.75 ppm, to which the U13 and G22 were assigned, respectively. According to the crystal structure of other tRNAs (2.Kim S.H.

Nature. 1980; 286: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), the s4U8-A14 is stacked above the 13–22 base pair in the D arm. Both s4U8 and U13 gave rise to NOEs at 11.90 ppm, which was assigned as G46, the base forming a tertiary interaction with U13 and G22. U12, U11, and G10 were assigned to the peak at 12.76, 14.69, and 12.35 ppm, respectively, according to the NOE connectivity between them and between U12 and U13, by using two-dimensional NOESY, HSQC, and three-dimensional NOESY-HSQC spectra. U11, U12, and U13 all gave rise to NOEs at 9.32 ppm, the high field shoulder of a broad peak, consisting of two components. This peak displayed a nitrogen chemical shift of 94.0 (data not shown), typical for an amino nitrogen. It also gave NOEs to a broad peak at 8.65 ppm and a sharp peak at 8.18 ppm, which should be an amino and an aromatic proton, respectively. These signals were therefore assigned to the two amino protons of A23 (9.32 and 8.65 ppm) and the H8 (8.18 ppm) of A9, which forms a reversed Hoogsteen base pair with A23 and is a component of the U12-A23-A9 base triplet (31.Quigley G.J. Rich A. Science. 1976; 194: 796-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Having assigned U13-G22, another wobble pair, G51U63, was therefore assigned to the peaks at 10.00 and 11.90 ppm, respectively. T54, a ribothymidine, is a special base forming another reversed Hoogsteen pair with A58. The protons of the 5-methyl group of T54 had several NOE cross-peaks to its imino proton and the two imino protons of ψ55, which also possess unique proton chemical shifts, and a cross-peak to H6 of T54 (14.Roy S. Redfield A.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 7073-7083Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). From the NOE pattern of the two-dimensional NOESY spectrum (Fig. 3), the peak at 13.82 ppm was assigned to T54. T54 gave rise to an NOE at 13.05 ppm, which was assigned as G53. G53 gave rise to an NOE at 12.68 ppm, to which G51U63 also had NOEs. Thus, one component of the peak at 12.68 ppm was assigned to G52. Unambiguous assignment of G52 was carried out by using15N-labeled G1C72 mutant (data not shown). On the other side, U63, the peaks at 13.98 and 13.20 ppm were connected in turn by NOEs. Thus U50 and G49 were assigned to the peaks at 13.98 and 13.20 ppm, respectively. Based on the proton and nitrogen chemical shifts from HSQC spectra and NOE connections from two-dimensional NOESY spectra of the peaks at 13.98, 12.86, and 13.31 ppm, a sequential connection of U-G-G was assigned in the same helical region. This U also gave rise to an NOE at 12.69 ppm. Thus a connection between GUGG was established from these peaks, which could only come from the anticodon stem and was assigned to G27-U42-G29-G30. The nitrogen chemical shift of G27 was assigned unambiguously by utilizing the HSQC spectrum of the G1C72 mutant, where G27 and G52 were well separated from G2 and G3 due to the shift of the G2 and G3 peaks. The remaining unassigned peaks in the spectra were from GC pairs and should be from the acceptor stem. There were five unassigned GC imino protons distributed in several overlapped peaks, and only one NOE cross-peak between peaks at 13.18 and 12.76 ppm in the two-dimensional NOESY spectra. Several 15N-labeled or non-labeled mutants were constructed to facilitate the assignment. In the two-dimensional NOESY spectra of A3U70, A4U69, and A5U68 mutants, the resonant peak of the guanine 5′ to the adenine was shifted upfield, and the one 3′ to the adenine was shifted downfield. By combining the information from the two-dimensional HSQC and two-dimensional NOESY spectra of various mutants, the G-C pairs in the acceptor stem were completely assigned as shown in TableI.Table IProton and nitrogen chemical shifts of imino groups of tRNA Trp in 10 mm MgCl2 at 30 °C1H15NAssignment1H15NAssignmentppmppm14.69163.7U1112.69147.9G2714.50181.0s4U812.68147.5G5213.98163.5U5012.67148.1G313.98162.8U4212.66147.7G213.91163.4U50′12.35148.2G1013.82160.2T5412.15159.5U1313.77160.1T54′12.02158.8U13′13.79162.5U811.90147.6G4613.31148.7G3011.54160.5Ψ55N313.20148.2G4911.54160.1Ψ55N3′13.18149.0G511.40157.8U63′13.14160.4U4811.33157.8U6313.14149.0G6710.46135.0Ψ55N1′13.05148.3G5310.33135.2Ψ55N113.00148.4G53′10.08143.2G51′12.93161.9U12′10.00143.1G5112.86147.7G299.81139.4G22′12.76162.0U129.75139.2G2212.76148.2G49.47146.3G18′9.40146.6G18 Open table in a new tab So far, all the signals in the two-dimensional HSQC spectrum were assigned, except one very weak peak at 13.42 ppm with nitrogen chemical shift of 162.2 ppm. This must be contributed by one of the three unassigned AU pairs, namely U31-A39 in the anticodon stem and A1-U72 and A7-U66 in the acceptor stem, all of which are at the end of helical regions. The disappearance of these imino protons suggests that they are in fast exchange with water or are open under the measurement conditions. There are several conserved tertiary base pairs in the tRNATrp structure. Both reversed Hoogsteen pairs, s4U8-A14 and T54-A58, have been previously assigned. As mentioned before, the imino proton and methyl group proton of T54 could give NOEs to the two imino protons of ψ55, as was observed in the two-dimensional NOESY spectrum. Thus the ψ55N3 proton, which is hydrogen-bonded to phosphate group of A58 (31.Quigley G.J. Rich A. Science. 1976; 194: 796-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), and ψ55N1 proton were assigned to peaks at 11.54 and 10.46 ppm, respectively. Their characteristic nitrogen chemical shifts confirmed the assignment (32.Griffey R.H. Davis D.R. Yamazumi Z. Nishimura S. Bax A. Hawkins B.L. Poulter C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9734-9741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,33.Davis D.R. Griffey R.H. Yamazumi Z. Nishimura S. Poulter C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3584-3587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). G18, hydrogen-bonded to ψ55 and stacked together with T54-A58 (31.Quigley G.J. Rich A. Science. 1976; 194: 796-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), was assigned to the peak at 9.40 ppm based on its NOE connections to T54 and ψ55. Based on an NOE connection to s4U8 and HSQC spectrum, U48, which forms a reversed Watson-Crick base pair with A15 and is stacked with s4U8-A14, was assigned to the peak at 13.14 ppm with a nitrogen chemical shift of 160.4 ppm. A broad but rather strong peak observed in the HMQC spectra acquired at 10 and 20 °C, with the nitrogen chemical shift of 150.0 ppm and proton chemical shifts of 10.09 ppm, was assigned to D20, a nucleotide in the D loop region. It has characteristic proton and nitrogen chemical shifts due to its hydrogen bonding with oxygen (32.Griffey R.H. Davis D.R. Yamazumi Z. Nishimura S. Bax A. Hawkins B.L. Poulter C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9734-9741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There were many peaks, mainly from the D stem and the TψC stem, in the HSQC spectrum (Fig. 2), each having an associate peak with lower intensity. These peaks also displayed NOE patterns in the two-dimensional NOESY spectrum similar to those of their associated peaks, except that the U13′ peak (the associate peak of U13) had an NOE to a peak with a proton chemical shift of 13.79 ppm and a nitrogen chemical shift of 162.5 ppm, which are typical chemical shifts for a uridine. This peak was therefore assigned to U8. The only difference between the two sets of peaks is that there was an s4U8 in one set and a U8 in the other set, demonstrating that there were two species of tRNATrp in the sample. The molar ratio of s4U8 to U8 in the hyperexpressed tRNATrp was reported to be only about 0.2, but the actual percentage might be higher because of its instability (20.Xue H. Glasser A. Desgres J. Grosjean H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2479-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The peak intensity of s4U8 was almost as high as that of U11 in the spectrum of the A73 mutant, whereas it was much lower than that of U11 in the wild type spectrum. The percentage of thiolation ranged from about 40% to about 95% as revealed by HSQC spectra. We therefore suggest that the other set of peaks was derived from the species in the tRNATrp sample containing U8 instead of s4U8. The results of the various assignments are summarized in Table I. Fig.4 shows the imino proton spectra of the tRNATrp wild type at different temperatures. As has been mentioned before, D20 could only be observed in the HSQC spectra acquired at 10 and 20 °C and disappeared at 30 °C on account of the increased exchange rate. In contrast, U12, G18, and G46 were not clearly observed in both one-dimensional and two-dimensional spectra at a temperature lower than 30 °C. U50 and G52 were weak at 10 and 20 °C. G67 became stronger and was upfield-shifted extensively with the increase of temperature. These results indicate that there might be a minor conformational change when temperature was raised from below room temperature. Some other peaks were also shifted slightly. No significant changes were observed when the temperature was raised from 30 to 50 °C except that the ψ55 N1 proton signal, which is not hydrogen-bonded, became broadened at 40 °C and vanished at 60 °C, because of an increased exchange rate of this proton with water. When the temperature was increased to 60 °C, the intensities of all the peaks decreased slightly. The peak intensities of U42, G29, and G30 from the anticodon stem were dramatically decreased, indicating that the exchange rates of these nucleotides were increased, with the possible existence of partial melting of the anticodon stem. Also, the peaks of U50 and G18 were decreased. At 70 °C, the anticodon stem melted extensively as indicated by the disappearance of U42, G30, and further decrease of G29. G18 disappeared too, indicating the disrupted linkage between D loop and TΨC loop. The tertiary base pair T54-A58 in TΨC loop melted at 75 °C, along with the G51U63 base pair in T stem. When the temperature was raised to 80 °C, all the peaks disappeared except that the very small residual peak for s4U8 remained visible but broadened, indicating the complete melting of the whole structure of this tRNA molecule. The methyl group signals are shown in the right column of Fig. 4. The peaks at 1.06 and 1.00 ppm at 30 °C were assigned to the methyl groups of T54 of the tRNATrp containing s4U8 or U8, respectively, based on their chemical shifts and NOEs observed in the two-dimensional NOESY spectrum (35.Emilsson V. Naslund A.K. Kurland C.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4499-4505Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The two well resolved sets of resonant peaks for the s4U8-containing and U8-containing tRNATrpspecies made possible the separate monitoring of the thermal stability of these two tRNATrp species. From 10 to 70 °C, the signal of T54 of the species containing s4U8 was only shifted slightly with no loss in intensities. This suggests that there was no conformational change around the D loop and TψC loop at below 70 °C. The peaks from the tRNATrp species containing U8, however, behaved differently. The T54 methyl signal of this species started to decrease at 50 °C and almost disappeared at 70 °C. When the temperature was increased further to 75 °C, the methyl group signal of the native state of the species containing s4U8 also decreased. Finally, at 80 °C, a strong peak at 1.73 ppm appeared, corresponding to the methyl group of T in the random coil state (34.Kan L.S. Ts'o P.O. Sprinzl M. Van der Haar F. Cramer F. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 3143-3154Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In summary, the whole structure of the tRNATrp species containing s4U8 is not altered even at 50 °C. Its anticodon stem becomes partially melted at 60 °C, whereas the TψC stem and the tertiary base pair between ψ55 and G18 are partially melted at 70 °C. At 80 °C, the structure of the molecule is disrupted and becomes a random coil. In comparison, the U8-containing tRNATrp species was less stable. Its conformation started to change at about 50 °C, as indicated by the diminished intensity of its T methyl signal, in contrast to the s4U8-containing species which started to change only above 60 °C. These findings suggest that the thiolation of U8 stabilizes the tRNATrp structure. The base modification pattern of B. subtilis tRNATrp hyperexpressed in E. coliis more similar to that of E. coli tRNATrp than to that of native B. subtilis tRNATrp (20.Xue H. Glasser A. Desgres J. Grosjean H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2479-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 21.Matsugi J. Murao K. Ishikura H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Two molecular species were found in the present study, one with s4U at position 8 and the other without such thiolation. Due to their similar chromatographic properties, these two species could not be separated by HPLC (19.Xue H. Shen W. Wong J.T. J. Chromatogr. 1993; 613: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This was evident in the15N-1H HSQC and proton NOESY spectra in which two distinct signals were observed for the same tertiary base pair between positions 8 and 14. The ratio between these components varied for different batches of tRNATrp, ranging from about 40 to 95%. Incomplete thiolation at position 8 was favored by overproduction of the cloned heterologous tRNATrp in minimal medium. Even for the native tRNAs of E. coli, the degree of thiolation in individual tRNA species is known to depend on bacterial growth rates (35.Emilsson V. Naslund A.K. Kurland C.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4499-4505Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The differences in the chemical shifts of the two molecular species mainly reside in the T stem and D stem and in the tertiary interactions between T and D loops, clearly indicating that the base modification at position 8 causes a conformational change in this region. The imino protons of15N-labeled B. subtilis tRNATrp were completely assigned with the use of multidimensional NMR techniques and comparison of wild type and mutant tRNATrp. In the two-dimensional NOESY spectrum, most of the imino peaks were correlated by NOE cross-peaks, permitting sequential assignments by NOEs. The commonly used starting points in assignment, such as s4U and GU pairs, were also utilized in the present study. For NOE cross-peaks from overlapped peaks, three-dimensional NOESY-HSQC was used to render the assignments unambiguous. Several tertiary base pairs were observed in the present study. Two reverse Hoogsteen pairs, s4U8-A14 and T54-A58, were assigned according to their characteristic chemical shifts and their NOEs to other imino protons as reported for other tRNAs (14.Roy S. Redfield A.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 7073-7083Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 30.Griffey R.H. Davis D.R. Yamazumi Z. Nishimura S. Hawkins B.L. Poulter C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12074-12078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Quigley G.J. Rich A. Science. 1976; 194: 796-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). A15-U48, a reverse Watson-Crick base pair connecting the D loop and variable loop, was assigned according to its NOE to s4U8. Also, the pairing of G18 and 89 55 was observed and assigned. However, the G19-C56 base pair connecting the d loop and TψC loop was not observed. This might not be entirely surprising in the light of differences among the D loop sequences of tRNATrp and those of yeast tRNAAsp and tRNAPhe. The G18G19 doublet in the D loop of tRNATrp is in the same sequence position as that in tRNAAsp but different from that in tRNAPhe, even though both of the latter two molecules have an 8-membered D loop, whereas tRNATrp has only a 7-membered D loop. The crystal structure of yeast tRNAAsp also lacks any interaction between G19 and C56 (36.Westhof E. Dumas P. Moras D. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 119-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), and the same applies toBombyx mori tRNAGCCGly (37.Amano M. Kyogoku Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 671-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), which has a similar D stem and loop sequence. This has been attributed to the occurrence of anticodon-anticodon interaction (36.Westhof E. Dumas P. Moras D. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 119-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). In tRNATrp, which has a CCA anticodon, apparently no anticodon-anticodon interaction can be expected. However, it is noteworthy that all these three tRNAs lack bases at positions 17 and 47, with a wobble pair instead at the 13–22 position in tRNATrp and tRNAAsp to compensate for the lack of base at 47 (38.Steinberg S. Ioudovitch A. RNA (NY). 1996; 2: 84-87PubMed Google Scholar), and another wobble pair at 10–25 in tRNAAsp and tRNASer. This implies that it is the characteristic structural feature of these tRNAs, rather than the anticodon-anticodon interactions, that results in the lack of interactions between G19 and C56 in solution. We have noticed that U12 resonates at 12.76 ppm, which is in a rather high field region compared with the chemical shifts of normal Watson-Crick A-U pairs. Similar situations were reported for U27 (12.70 ppm) in E. coli initiator tRNAfMet (39.Griffey R. Poulter C.D. Bax A. Hawkins B.L. Yamaizumi Z. Nishimura S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5895-5897Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), U7 (12.6 ppm) in E. coli tRNAVal (15.Hare D.R. Ribeiro N.S. Wemmer D.E. Reid B.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4300-4306Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and U7 in Thermus thermophilus tRNAIle (40.Choi B.S. Redfield A.G. Biochemistry. 1983; 25: 1529-1534Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In comparison, the U12 in tRNAAsp and tRNASer resonates in a far more downfield region, although they all have similar sequences in the D stem. A possible explanation is that there exists a rather special local conformation in tRNATrp different from that in tRNAAsp and tRNASer. In the present study, three AU pairs, two from the acceptor stem and one from the anticodon stem, were not assigned in NMR spectra. All of these AU pairs are located at the end of the stem and thus may exchange very rapidly with water. In the HSQC spectrum, a very weak cross-peak from uridine was not assigned. If the acceptor stem of the tRNATrp is also stacked on the TψC stem as in the crystal structure of yeast tRNAPhe or E. coli tRNAIle in solution (41.Hare D. Reid B.R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5129-5135Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the A7-U66 base pair should be protected from fast exchange with water, as was observed in the studies of tRNAAsp (42.Roy S. Papastavros M.Z. Redfield A.G. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6081-6088Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We therefore tentatively assign this peak to A7U66. Thermal melting experiments showed that in the presence of high magnesium ion concentration the melting of the structure was cooperative in character, compared with a more sequential behavior in the absence of magnesium (43.Kastrup R.V. Schmidt P.G. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 3612-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The D stem and s4U8-A14 base pair were stabilized with Mg2+binding. The tRNATrp species containing s4U8 is more stable thermally by about 20 °C than that containing U8 with regard to the initiation of thermal unfolding, thus providing striking evidence that the thiolation of U8 stabilizes the tertiary structure of tRNATrp.

This effect has received little attention in recent years, probably because the induction of anchorage-independent growth by TGF-β has been observed only in a few cell lines, of which NRK fibroblasts are among the best studied. We have previously reported that normal rat kidney cells have lost their normal adhesion requirement for expression of cyclin D1, and we now show that this loss is causal for the induction of anchorage-independent growth by TGF-β. First, we show that TGF-β fails to induce anchorage-independent growth in NIH-3T3 cells and human fibroblasts that have retained their adhesion requirement for expression of cyclin D1. Second, we show that TGF-β complements rather than affects cyclin D-cdk4/6 kinase activity in NRK cells. Third, we show that forced expression of cyclin D1 in suspended 3T3 cells renders them susceptible to transformation by TGF-β. These results may explain why the induction of anchorage-independent growth by TGF-β is a rare event and yet also describe a molecular scenario in which the mesenchymal response to TGF-β could indeed involve the acquisition of an anchorage-independent phenotype.

The induction of cyclin D1 is the rate-limiting step for activation of cyclin D-cdk4/6 (1.Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2576) Google Scholar). The down-regulation of the Cip/Kip family of cdk inhibitors (p21 cip1 and p27 kip1 in particular) and sequestration of these inhibitors by cyclin D-cdk4/6 is thought to control the activation of cyclin E-cdk2 (2.Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5072) Google Scholar). Once activated, cyclin D-cdk4/6 and cyclin E-cdk2 phosphorylate the retinoblastoma protein (pRb), allowing for the dissociation of bound E2F and the induction of E2F-regulated genes, among which is cyclin A (1.Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2576) Google Scholar, 3.Weinberg R. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4277) Google Scholar, 4.Zwicker J. Müller R. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 3-6Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Cyclin A binds to cdk2, and the formation of active cyclin A-cdk2 is required for entry into the S phase of the cell cycle (5.Girard F. Strausfeld U. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Cell. 1991; 67: 1169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). In non-transformed cells, G1 phase cyclin-cdk activity is regulated by mitogenic growth factors and cell anchorage to the extracellular matrix. We and others (6.Zhu X. Ohtsubo M. Böhmer R.M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 7.Fang F. Orend G. Watanabe N. Hunter T. Ruoslahti E.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 503-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) have shown that the expression of cyclin D1, the down-regulation of Cip/Kips, the activation of cyclin E-cdk2, the phosphorylation of pRb, and the expression of cyclin A are all jointly regulated by growth factor and extracellular matrix signals in non-transformed cells. Thus, normal fibroblasts and most fibroblastic cell lines cultured in suspension fail to induce cyclin D1 or down-regulate p21 cip1 and p27 kip1 even when exposed to optimal concentrations of mitogens. In contrast, oncogene-transformed cells typically do not require exogenous growth factors or cell anchorage for proliferation. These phenotypes have been termed mitogen-independent and anchorage-independent growth, respectively. Anchorage-independent growth is a particularly good correlate to tumorigenicity in vivo (11.Shin S. Freedman V.H. Risser R. Pollack R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4435-4439Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Early studies with the cytokine TGF-β indicated that it would induce anchorage-independent growth phenotypically (12.Roberts A.B. Frolik C.A. Anzano M.A. Sporn M.B. Fed. Proc. 1983; 42: 2621-2626PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Massagué J. Kelly B. Mottola C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4551-4554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but many subsequent investigations have shown that TGF-β is most often a proliferation inhibitor, especially in epithelial cells (14.Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (2990) Google Scholar, 15.Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1994; 371: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (1875) Google Scholar, 16.Datto M.B. Li Y.

Indeed, the ability of TGF-β to induce anchorage-independent growth is restricted to a few select fibroblast cell lines; NRK fibroblasts are among the best studied in this regard. The fact that this transforming effect of TGF-β is not generally observable clearly reduced interest in this potential aspect of TGF-β biology. Anchorage-independent growth reflects the fact that cells have lost their adhesion requirement for activation of the G1 phase cyclin-cdks. Because both cyclin D-cdk4/6 and cyclin E-cdk2 activities are anchorage-dependent (19.Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), and because both are required for efficient progression through the G1 phase (see above), cells can lose their adhesion requirement for activation of one of those enzymes and still retain the anchorage-dependent for proliferation. For example, we have previously shown that NRK fibroblasts have lost their adhesion requirement for expression of cyclin D1 and yet retain the anchorage-dependent phenotype for growth (6.Zhu X. Ohtsubo M. Böhmer R.M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 20.Guadagno T.M. Ohtsubo M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. Science. 1993; 262: 1572-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). We now show that loss of the anchorage requirement for cyclin D1 expression, although non-transforming in itself, renders cells susceptible to transformation by TGF-β. Our results can explain why the induction of anchorage-independent growth by TGF-β is a rare event, and yet they also describe a molecular scenario in which the mesenchymal response to TGF-β could indeed involve acquisition of an anchorage-independent phenotype. NRK (clone 49F), NIH-3T3 cells, and early passage cultures of human foreskin fibroblasts were cultured and rendered quiescent by serum starvation as described (6.Zhu X. Ohtsubo M. Böhmer R.M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 21.Zhu X., K. Roovers G. Davey Assoian R.K. Guan J.-L. Signaling through Cell Adhesion Molecules. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1999: 129-140Google Scholar). For experimentation, cells were trypsinized and reseeded in monolayer (uncoated) or suspension (agar or agarose-coated) tissue culture dishes using 106 cells in 10 ml of medium (5–10% FCS-DMEM)/100-mm dish or 2–3 × 106 cells in 20 ml of medium/150-mm dish. Recombinant EGF and TGF-β1 (both from Life Technologies, Inc.) were added to the cultures at final concentrations of 2 nm and 100 pm, respectively. Anchorage-independent growth was assessed by incorporation of [3H]thymidine into trichloroacetic acid-insoluble radioactivity and by colony formation in soft agar (21.Zhu X., K. Roovers G. Davey Assoian R.K. Guan J.-L. Signaling through Cell Adhesion Molecules. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1999: 129-140Google Scholar, 22.Han E.K.-H. Guadagno T.M. Dalton S.L. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). NIH-3T3 cells were transfected with human cyclin D1 using the tetracycline-repressible expression system. The transfected cells were cultured in the presence of tetracycline (added daily to a final concentration of 2 μg/ml), and stable transfectants were isolated by selection in G418 (0.5 mg/ml) and hygromycin (0.4 mg/ml). Immunoblotting identified several clones in which the expression of cyclin D1 was strongly regulated by tetracycline. Tet-cyclin D1–3T3 cells were maintained at <50% confluence in DMEM, 10% calf serum, and 2 μg/ml tetracycline, added daily. G418 and hygromycin were replaced weekly. Cells were collected by scraping (monolayer cultures) or low speed centrifugation (suspension cultures), washed 2–3 times in phosphate-buffered saline, and extracted in TNE (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm sodium fluoride, and 10 mm sodium orthovanadate; ∼50 μl/2 × 106 cells) in preparation for immunoblotting or in Tween-containing buffer (∼50 μl/3–5 × 106 cells) in preparation for cdk4 immunoprecipitations and kinase assays using GST-pRb as substrate (23.Matsushime H. Quelle D.E. Shurtleff S.A. Masabumi S. Sherr C.J. Kato J.-Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2066-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of cell extracts was determined by Coomassie binding (Bio-Rad protein assay), and 100-μg aliquots were fractionated on reducing SDS-gels (typically 7.5% acrylamide) prior to electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose and immunoblotting using antibodies specific for pRb (Ciba-Corning), cyclin D1 (Upstate Biotechnology), cdk4 (Santa Cruz Laboratories) and cyclin A (prepared in this laboratory). Enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to visualize the bound antibodies. NRK fibroblasts are anchorage-dependent when cultured in suspension with mitogen (serum and EGF)-containing medium, but they are rendered anchorage-independent by exposure to mitogens and TGF-β (Fig. 1 A). Even though they are anchorage-dependent, serum/EGF-stimulated NRK cell suspensions readily expressed cyclin D1 (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, NIH-3T3 cells and normal human fibroblasts, which are resistant to the transforming effect of TGF-β (Fig. 1 A), showed the usual anchorage requirement for expression of cyclin D1 and failed to express cyclin D1 when stimulated with serum and EGF in suspension (Fig. 1 B). Thus, susceptibility to the transforming effect of TGF-β correlated with the loss of the anchorage requirement for expression of cyclin D1. Cyclin D1 immunoblotting and cyclin D-cdk4 in vitro kinase assays were performed with extracts of suspended NRK cells that had been cultured in serum-containing medium with and without EGF and TGF-β. The results showed that neither EGF nor TGF-β affected cyclin D1 expression (Fig.2 A), cdk4 expression (Fig.2A), or cyclin D-cdk4 kinase activity (Fig. 2 B). Thus, these events are likely to be induced by the serum in this system and are not the target of TGF-β action. However, Fig. 2 C shows that pRb phosphorylation and cyclin A expression decay within 24 h when suspended NRK cells are treated with serum alone, with serum/EGF, or with serum/TGF-β (conditions that do not efficiently support anchorage-independent growth). In contrast, treatment of suspended NRK cells with mitogens (serum/EGF) and TGF-β (conditions that do support anchorage-independent growth) allowed for prolonged hyperphosphorylation of pRb and expression of cyclin A (Fig.2 C). Overall, the results of Fig. 2 indicates that mitogenic stimulation allows for cyclin D-cdk4 activity in suspended NRK cells and that TGF-β (perhaps together with EGF) complements, rather than regulates, cyclin D-cdk4 activity. Together with Fig. 1, the data also suggest that loss of the anchorage requirement for cyclin D1 expression might explain why NRK cells are susceptible to transformation by TGF-β. We therefore asked whether cells resistant to the transforming effect of TGF-β could be rendered susceptible by over-riding their adhesion requirement for expression of cyclin D1. The murine cyclin D1 cDNA was cloned into a tetracycline-regulated expression vector and transfected into NIH-3T3 cells. Stable transfectants were selected in the presence of tetracycline and then cultured in monolayer or suspension with mitogens. In contrast to their adherent counterparts (Fig. 3 A, Mono + tetracycline), mitogen-stimulated transfectants cultured in suspension with tetracycline poorly expressed cyclin D1, contained hypophosphorylated pRb, and poorly expressed cyclin A (Fig.3 A, Susp + tetracycline). This is the same phenotype we observed with parental NIH-3T3 cells and normal human fibroblasts (6.Zhu X. Ohtsubo M. Böhmer R.M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Removal of tetracycline allowed for expression of cyclin D1 in suspended tet-cyclin D1–3T3 cells, and the expression of cyclin D1 was associated with pRb phosphorylation and increased cyclin A expression in short-term (18–24 h) suspension cultures (Fig. 3 A, Susp − tetracycline). This result supports previous studies indicating that anchorage-dependent expression of cyclin D1 controls anchorage-independent pRb phosphorylation and pRb-dependent cyclin A expression (6.Zhu X. Ohtsubo M. Böhmer R.M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar,8.Resnitzky D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5640-5647Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 9.Schulze A. Thome-Zerfass K. Bergès J. Middendorp S. Jansen-Dürr P. Henglein B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4632-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, in long-term (>1 day) suspension cultures stimulated with mitogens (serum and EGF), cyclin D1 expression was maintained while pRb phosphorylation and cyclin A expression declined (Fig.3 B). The short- and long-term phenotypes of induced tet-cyclin D1–3T3 cells are the same as those observed in NRK cells (refer to Fig. 2, A and C; cells cultured without TGF-β for 1 and 3 days). Thus, by forcing anchorage-independent expression of cyclin D1, we engineered the NRK phenotype into 3T3 cells. We assessed anchorage-independent growth of the tet-cyclin D1–3T3 cells by measuring both [3H]thymidine incorporation into newly synthesized DNA (Fig.4 A) and colony formation in soft agar (Fig. 4 B). Transfectants cultured with tetracycline were anchorage-dependent when treated with mitogens (serum and EGF) or mitogens and TGF-β. Removal of tetracycline allowed for the expression of cyclin D1 (not shown, but refer to Fig. 3), but cyclin D1 expression poorly stimulated anchorage-independent growth of the mitogen-treated cells. Thus, as with NRK cells, expression of cyclin D1 is not sufficient to induce a strong anchorage-independent phenotype. However, the mitogen-stimulated 3T3 transfectants did become anchorage-independent when also treated with TGF-β (Fig. 4, A and B). In fact, the phenotype of induced tet-cyclin D1–3T3 cells resembles that of NRK cells, whereas the phenotype of uninduced tet-cyclin D1–3T3 cells resembles that of parental 3T3 cells (compare Figs. 4 and1 A). Three independent clones of tet-cyclin D1–3T3 cells have given similar results using both [3H]thymidine-based and colony formation-based assays for anchorage-independent growth (not shown). We conclude that TGF-β fails to induce anchorage-independent growth in normal fibroblasts because they are adhesion-dependent for expression of cyclin D1. An extrapolation of our results is that loss of adhesion-dependent cyclin D1 expression is a prerequisite for cell transformation in response to TGF-β. Several years ago, Massagué and co-workers (13.Massagué J. Kelly B. Mottola C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4551-4554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that Balb/c 3T3 cells could be rendered responsive to TGF-β if the cells were exposed to insulin-like growth factor activity as well as serum and EGF. Because we now know that cyclin D1 expression is strongly mitogen-dependent (1.Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2576) Google Scholar), the inclusion of insulin-like growth factor activity may have overcome an adhesion requirement for cyclin D1 expression in suspended Balb/c 3T3 cells. The results shown here raise the question of how TGF-β complements cyclin D1 expression and cyclin D-cdk4/6 activity to induce anchorage-independent growth. We considered the possibility that TGF-β was stimulating long-term cyclin A expression through a pRb-dependent mechanism by enhancing cyclin E-cdk2 activity (e.g. by affecting expression of the Cip/Kip cdk inhibitors). We have detected an increase in cyclin E-cdk2 kinase activity when mitogen-treated NRK cell suspensions are treated with TGF-β (data not shown). However, the loss of cell cycle synchrony in these necessarily long-term cultures has precluded a satisfactory mechanistic examination of this issue. TGF-β could also be regulating cyclin A expression independently of effects on cyclin-cdks, perhaps by activating the non-pRb/E2F sites in the cyclin A promoter (24.Heinglein B. Chenivesse X. Wang J.

Resolution of these issues will require further study. Our results indicate that anchorage-independent expression of cyclin D1 is a prerequisite for induction of anchorage-independent growth by TGF-β. This effect would probably be insufficient to confer TGF-β sensitivity in epithelial cells where TGF-β has been reported to strongly increases p15 ink4b, cdc25A, or p21 cip1 (15.Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1994; 371: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (1875) Google Scholar, 16.Datto M.B. Li Y. Panus J.F. Howe D.J. Xiong Y. Wang X.-F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nevertheless, the results shown here provide a proof of principle, explaining the long-standing observation that TGF-β potently induces anchorage-independence in certain cell lines while having no effect on others. If anchorage-independent cyclin D1 expression occurs physiologically (e.g. at sites of injury) or pathologically (e.g. in cells that overexpress cyclin D1), then induction of anchorage-independent growth may be a specialized response to TGF-β.

https://openalex.org/W2020917137,"Abstract We have examined the effects of removing individual template nucleosides on promoter escape by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase in vitro. The ability of DNA templates containing random single nucleoside gaps generated by hydroxyl radical treatment to support the production of stable ternary transcription complexes was analyzed. On two templates containing different promoter and initial transcribed regions, we found that removal of nucleosides on the template strand in the region from −13 to at least +8 relative to the transcription start site interfered with ternary complex formation. The downstream border of this region varied for the two templates, suggesting an effect of the specific nucleotide sequence on the stability of intermediates in the promoter escape process. On the nontemplate strand, removal of nucleosides in the vicinity of the −10 consensus promoter element interfered with escape, whereas removal of nucleosides in the vicinity of the transcription start site actually enhanced the yield of ternary complexes. On one template, removal of nucleosides in an A-tract containing region upstream of the promoter caused a significant decrease in promoter escape, consistent with previous suggestions that contacts between this region and the RNA polymerase play a role in promoter binding and/or initiation."
