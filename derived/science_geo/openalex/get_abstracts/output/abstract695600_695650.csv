https://openalex.org/W4283366078,"The metastatic spread of cancer is achieved by the haematogenous dissemination of circulating tumour cells (CTCs). Generally, however, the temporal dynamics that dictate the generation of metastasis-competent CTCs are largely uncharacterized, and it is often assumed that CTCs are constantly shed from growing tumours or are shed as a consequence of mechanical insults1. Here we observe a striking and unexpected pattern of CTC generation dynamics in both patients with breast cancer and mouse models, highlighting that most spontaneous CTC intravasation events occur during sleep. Further, we demonstrate that rest-phase CTCs are highly prone to metastasize, whereas CTCs generated during the active phase are devoid of metastatic ability. Mechanistically, single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of CTCs reveals a marked upregulation of mitotic genes exclusively during the rest phase in both patients and mouse models, enabling metastasis proficiency. Systemically, we find that key circadian rhythm hormones such as melatonin, testosterone and glucocorticoids dictate CTC generation dynamics, and as a consequence, that insulin directly promotes tumour cell proliferation in vivo, yet in a time-dependent manner. Thus, the spontaneous generation of CTCs with a high proclivity to metastasize does not occur continuously, but it is concentrated within the rest phase of the affected individual, providing a new rationale for time-controlled interrogation and treatment of metastasis-prone cancers. A study of patients with breast cancer and mouse models demonstrates that most circulating tumour cells are generated during the rest phase of the circadian rhythm, and that these cells are highly prone to metastasize."
https://openalex.org/W4283262943,"Natural microbial communities are phylogenetically and metabolically diverse. In addition to underexplored organismal groups1, this diversity encompasses a rich discovery potential for ecologically and biotechnologically relevant enzymes and biochemical compounds2,3. However, studying this diversity to identify genomic pathways for the synthesis of such compounds4 and assigning them to their respective hosts remains challenging. The biosynthetic potential of microorganisms in the open ocean remains largely uncharted owing to limitations in the analysis of genome-resolved data at the global scale. Here we investigated the diversity and novelty of biosynthetic gene clusters in the ocean by integrating around 10,000 microbial genomes from cultivated and single cells with more than 25,000 newly reconstructed draft genomes from more than 1,000 seawater samples. These efforts revealed approximately 40,000 putative mostly new biosynthetic gene clusters, several of which were found in previously unsuspected phylogenetic groups. Among these groups, we identified a lineage rich in biosynthetic gene clusters ('Candidatus Eudoremicrobiaceae') that belongs to an uncultivated bacterial phylum and includes some of the most biosynthetically diverse microorganisms in this environment. From these, we characterized the phospeptin and pythonamide pathways, revealing cases of unusual bioactive compound structure and enzymology, respectively. Together, this research demonstrates how microbiomics-driven strategies can enable the investigation of previously undescribed enzymes and natural products in underexplored microbial groups and environments."

https://openalex.org/W4283367198,"The regenerative potential of mammalian peripheral nervous system neurons after injury is critically limited by their slow axonal regenerative rate1. Regenerative ability is influenced by both injury-dependent and injury-independent mechanisms2. Among the latter, environmental factors such as exercise and environmental enrichment have been shown to affect signalling pathways that promote axonal regeneration3. Several of these pathways, including modifications in gene transcription and protein synthesis, mitochondrial metabolism and the release of neurotrophins, can be activated by intermittent fasting (IF)4,5. However, whether IF influences the axonal regenerative ability remains to be investigated. Here we show that IF promotes axonal regeneration after sciatic nerve crush in mice through an unexpected mechanism that relies on the gram-positive gut microbiome and an increase in the gut bacteria-derived metabolite indole-3-propionic acid (IPA) in the serum. IPA production by Clostridium sporogenes is required for efficient axonal regeneration, and delivery of IPA after sciatic injury significantly enhances axonal regeneration, accelerating the recovery of sensory function. Mechanistically, RNA sequencing analysis from sciatic dorsal root ganglia suggested a role for neutrophil chemotaxis in the IPA-dependent regenerative phenotype, which was confirmed by inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis. Our results demonstrate the ability of a microbiome-derived metabolite, such as IPA, to facilitate regeneration and functional recovery of sensory axons through an immune-mediated mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W4283272302,"Itch triggers scratching, a behavioural defence mechanism that aids in the removal of harmful irritants and parasites1. Chemical itch is triggered by many endogenous and exogenous cues, such as pro-inflammatory histamine, which is released during an allergic reaction1. Mechanical itch can be triggered by light sensations such as wool fibres or a crawling insect2. In contrast to chemical itch pathways, which have been extensively studied, the mechanisms that underlie the transduction of mechanical itch are largely unknown. Here we show that the mechanically activated ion channel PIEZO1 (ref. 3) is selectively expressed by itch-specific sensory neurons and is required for their mechanically activated currents. Loss of PIEZO1 function in peripheral neurons greatly reduces mechanically evoked scratching behaviours and both acute and chronic itch-evoked sensitization. Finally, mice expressing a gain-of-function Piezo1 allele4 exhibit enhanced mechanical itch behaviours. Our studies reveal the polymodal nature of itch sensory neurons and identify a role for PIEZO1 in the sensation of itch."
https://openalex.org/W4283259772,"The identification of mechanisms to promote memory T (Tmem) cells has important implications for vaccination and anti-cancer immunotherapy1â€“4. Using a CRISPR-based screen for negative regulators of Tmem cell generation in vivo5, here we identify multiple components of the mammalian canonical BRG1/BRM-associated factor (cBAF)6,7. Several components of the cBAF complex are essential for the differentiation of activated CD8+ T cells into T effector (Teff) cells, and their loss promotes Tmem cell formation in vivo. During the first division of activated CD8+ T cells, cBAF and MYC8 frequently co-assort asymmetrically to the two daughter cells. Daughter cells with high MYC and high cBAF display a cell fate trajectory towards Teff cells, whereas those with low MYC and low cBAF preferentially differentiate towards Tmem cells. The cBAF complex and MYC physically interact to establish the chromatin landscape in activated CD8+ T cells. Treatment of naive CD8+ T cells with a putative cBAF inhibitor during the first 48 h of activation, before the generation of chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells, markedly improves efficacy in a mouse solid tumour model. Our results establish cBAF as a negative determinant of Tmem cell fate and suggest that manipulation of cBAF early in T cell differentiation can improve cancer immunotherapy. cBAF is a negative determinant of memory T cell fate and the manipulation of cBAF early in T cell differentiation can improve cancer immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W4283330621,"A long-standing question in nuclear physics is whether chargeless nuclear systems can exist. To our knowledge, only neutron stars represent near-pure neutron systems, where neutrons are squeezed together by the gravitational force to very high densities. The experimental search for isolated multi-neutron systems has been an ongoing quest for several decades1, with a particular focus on the four-neutron system called the tetraneutron, resulting in only a few indications of its existence so far2-4, leaving the tetraneutron an elusive nuclear system for six decades. Here we report on the observation of a resonance-like structure near threshold in the four-neutron system that is consistent with a quasi-bound tetraneutron state existing for a very short time. The measured energy and width of this state provide a key benchmark for our understanding of the nuclear force. The use of an experimental approach based on a knockout reaction at large momentum transfer with a radioactive high-energy 8He beam was key."
https://openalex.org/W4283261724,"Bacterial conjugation is the fundamental process of unidirectional transfer of DNAs, often plasmid DNAs, from a donor cell to a recipient cell1. It is the primary means by which antibiotic resistance genes spread among bacterial populations2,3. In Gram-negative bacteria, conjugation is mediated by a large transport apparatus-the conjugative type IV secretion system (T4SS)-produced by the donor cell and embedded in both its outer and inner membranes. The T4SS also elaborates a long extracellular filament-the conjugative pilus-that is essential for DNA transfer4,5. Here we present a high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of a 2.8 megadalton T4SS complex composed of 92 polypeptides representing 8 of the 10 essential T4SS components involved in pilus biogenesis. We added the two remaining components to the structural model using co-evolution analysis of protein interfaces, to enable the reconstitution of the entire system including the pilus. This structure describes the exceptionally large protein-protein interaction network required to assemble the many components that constitute a T4SS and provides insights on the unique mechanism by which they elaborate pili."
https://openalex.org/W4283374563,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a heterogenous neurodegenerative disorder that affects motor neurons and voluntary muscle control1. ALS heterogeneity includes the age of manifestation, the rate of progression and the anatomical sites of symptom onset. Disease-causing mutations in specific genes have been identified and define different subtypes of ALS1. Although several ALS-associated genes have been shown to affect immune functions2, whether specific immune features account for ALS heterogeneity is poorly understood. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-4 (ALS4) is characterized by juvenile onset and slow progression3. Patients with ALS4 show motor difficulties by the time that they are in their thirties, and most of them require devices to assist with walking by their fifties. ALS4 is caused by mutations in the senataxin gene (SETX). Here, using Setx knock-in mice that carry the ALS4-causative L389S mutation, we describe an immunological signature that consists of clonally expanded, terminally differentiated effector memory (TEMRA) CD8 T cells in the central nervous system and the blood of knock-in mice. Increased frequencies of antigen-specific CD8 T cells in knock-in mice mirror the progression of motor neuron disease and correlate with anti-glioma immunity. Furthermore, bone marrow transplantation experiments indicate that the immune system has a key role in ALS4 neurodegeneration. In patients with ALS4, clonally expanded TEMRA CD8 T cells circulate in the peripheral blood. Our results provide evidence of an antigen-specific CD8 T cell response in ALS4, which could be used to unravel disease mechanisms and as a potential biomarker of disease state."
https://openalex.org/W4283361562,"The realization of controllable fermionic quantum systems via quantum simulation is instrumental for exploring many of the most intriguing effects in condensed-matter physics1-3. Semiconductor quantum dots are particularly promising for quantum simulation as they can be engineered to achieve strong quantum correlations. However, although simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model4 and Nagaoka ferromagnetism5 have been reported before, the simplest one-dimensional model of strongly correlated topological matter, the many-body Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model6-11, has so far remained elusive-mostly owing to the challenge of precisely engineering long-range interactions between electrons to reproduce the chosen Hamiltonian. Here we show that for precision-placed atoms in silicon with strong Coulomb confinement, we can engineer a minimum of six all-epitaxial in-plane gates to tune the energy levels across a linear array of ten quantum dots to realize both the trivial and the topological phases of the many-body SSH model. The strong on-site energies (about 25 millielectronvolts) and the ability to engineer gates with subnanometre precision in a unique staggered design allow us to tune the ratio between intercell and intracell electron transport to observe clear signatures of a topological phase with two conductance peaks at quarter-filling, compared with the ten conductance peaks of the trivial phase. The demonstration of the SSH model in a fermionic system isomorphic to qubits showcases our highly controllable quantum system and its usefulness for future simulations of strongly interacting electrons."
https://openalex.org/W4283275063,"The divergence of the common dendritic cell progenitor1â€“3 (CDP) into the conventional type 1 and type 2 dendritic cell (cDC1 and cDC2, respectively) lineages4,5 is poorly understood. Some transcription factors act in the commitment of already specified progenitorsâ€”such as BATF3, which stabilizes Irf8 autoactivation at the +32 kb Irf8 enhancer4,6â€”but the mechanisms controlling the initial divergence of CDPs remain unknown. Here we report the transcriptional basis of CDP divergence and describe the first requirements for pre-cDC2 specification. Genetic epistasis analysis7 suggested that Nfil3 acts upstream of Id2, Batf3 and Zeb2 in cDC1 development but did not reveal its mechanism or targets. Analysis of newly generated NFIL3 reporter mice showed extremely transient NFIL3 expression during cDC1 specification. CUT&RUN and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing identified endogenous NFIL3 binding in the â€“165 kb Zeb2 enhancer8 at three sites that also bind the CCAAT-enhancer-binding proteins C/EBPÎ± and C/EBPÎ². In vivo mutational analysis using CRISPRâ€“Cas9 targeting showed that these NFIL3â€“C/EBP sites are functionally redundant, with C/EBPs supporting and NFIL3 repressing Zeb2 expression at these sites. A triple mutation of all three NFIL3â€“C/EBP sites ablated Zeb2 expression in myeloid, but not lymphoid progenitors, causing the complete loss of pre-cDC2 specification and mature cDC2 development in vivo. These mice did not generate T helper 2 (TH2) cell responses against Heligmosomoides polygyrus infection, consistent with cDC2 supporting TH2 responses to helminths9â€“11. Thus, CDP divergence into cDC1 or cDC2 is controlled by competition between NFIL3 and C/EBPs at the â€“165 kb Zeb2 enhancer. The transcription factor NFIL3 acts antagonistically to C/EBP proteins by binding the Zeb2 enhancer to prevent Zeb2 expression and the development of the conventional type 2 dendritic cell lineage."

https://openalex.org/W4283320110,"Devices made using thin-film semiconductors have attracted much interest recently owing to new application possibilities. Among materials systems suitable for thin-film electronics, organic semiconductors are of particular interest; their low cost, biocompatible carbon-based materials and deposition by simple techniques such as evaporation or printing enable organic semiconductor devices to be used for ubiquitous electronics, such as those used on or in the human body or on clothing and packages1-3. The potential of organic electronics can be leveraged only if the performance of organic transistors is improved markedly. Here we present organic bipolar transistors with outstanding device performance: a previously undescribed vertical architecture and highly crystalline organic rubrene thin films yield devices with high differential amplification (more than 100) and superior high-frequency performance over conventional devices. These bipolar transistors also give insight into the minority carrier diffusion length-a key parameter in organic semiconductors. Our results open the door to new device concepts of high-performance organic electronics with ever faster switching speeds."
https://openalex.org/W4283259136,"Translation initiation defines the identity and quantity of a synthesized protein. The process is dysregulated in many human diseases1,2. A key commitment step is when the ribosomal subunits join at a translation start site on a messenger RNA to form a functional ribosome. Here, we combined single-molecule spectroscopy and structural methods using an in vitro reconstituted system to examine how the human ribosomal subunits join. Single-molecule fluorescence revealed when the universally conserved eukaryotic initiation factors eIF1A and eIF5B associate with and depart from initiation complexes. Guided by single-molecule dynamics, we visualized initiation complexes that contained both eIF1A and eIF5B using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. The resulting structure revealed how eukaryote-specific contacts between the two proteins remodel the initiation complex to orient the initiator aminoacyl-tRNA in a conformation compatible with ribosomal subunit joining. Collectively, our findings provide a quantitative and architectural framework for the molecular choreography orchestrated by eIF1A and eIF5B during translation initiation in humans."
https://openalex.org/W4283384102,"Patients with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer, the most common subtype, remain at risk for lethal metastatic disease years after diagnosis. Recurrence arises partly because tumor cells in bone marrow become resistant to estrogen-targeted therapy. Here, we utilized a co-culture model of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and ER+ breast cancer cells to recapitulate interactions of cancer cells in bone marrow niches. ER+ breast cancer cells in direct contact with MSCs acquire cancer stem-like (CSC) phenotypes with increased resistance to standard antiestrogenic drugs. We confirmed that co-culture with MSCs increased labile iron in breast cancer cells, a phenotype associated with CSCs and disease progression. Clinically approved iron chelators and in-house lysosomal iron-targeting compounds restored sensitivity to antiestrogenic therapy. These findings establish iron modulation as a mechanism to reverse MSC-induced drug resistance and suggest iron modulation in combination with estrogen-targeted therapy as a promising, translatable strategy to treat ER+ breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3187440714,"Positrons bind to molecules leading to vibrational excitation and spectacularly enhanced annihilation. Whilst positron binding energies have been measured via resonant annihilation spectra for $\sim$90 molecules in the past two decades, an accurate \emph{ab initio} theoretical description has remained elusive. Of the molecules studied experimentally, calculations exist for only 6, and for these, standard quantum chemistry approaches have proved severely deficient, agreeing with experiment to at best 25% accuracy for polar molecules, and failing to predict binding in nonpolar molecules. The mechanisms of binding are not understood. Here, we develop a many-body theory of positron-molecule interactions and uncover the role of strong many-body correlations including polarization of the electron cloud, screening of the positron-electron Coulomb interaction by molecular electrons, and crucially, the unique non-perturbative process of virtual-positronium formation (where a molecular electron temporarily tunnels to the positron): they dramatically enhance binding in polar molecules and enable binding in nonpolars. We also elucidate the role of individual molecular orbitals, highlighting the importance of electronic $\pi$ bonds. Overall, we calculate binding energies in agreement with experiment (to within 1% in cases), and we predict binding in formamide and nucleobases. As well as supporting resonant annihilation experiments and positron-based molecular spectroscopy, the approach can be extended to positron scattering and annihilation $\gamma$ spectra in molecules and condensed matter, to provide fundamental insight and predictive capability required to properly interpret materials science diagnostics, develop antimatter-based technologies (including positron traps, beams and positron emission tomography), and understand positrons in the galaxy."
https://openalex.org/W4283372224,"The Î±-helix is pre-eminent in structural biology1 and widely exploited in protein folding2, design3 and engineering4. Although other helical peptide conformations do exist near to the Î±-helical region of conformational space-namely, 310-helices and Ï€-helices5-these occur much less frequently in protein structures. Less favourable internal energies and reduced tendencies to pack into higher-order structures mean that 310-helices rarely exceed six residues in length in natural proteins, and that they tend not to form normal supersecondary, tertiary or quaternary interactions. Here we show that despite their absence in nature, synthetic peptide assemblies can be built from 310-helices. We report the rational design, solution-phase characterization and an X-ray crystal structure for water-soluble bundles of 310-helices with consolidated hydrophobic cores. The design uses six-residue repeats informed by analysing 310-helical conformations in known protein structures, and incorporates Î±-aminoisobutyric acid residues. Design iterations reveal a tipping point between Î±-helical and 310-helical folding, and identify features required for stabilizing assemblies of 310-helices. This work provides principles and rules to open opportunities for designing into this hitherto unexplored region of protein-structure space."

https://openalex.org/W4283311026,"Cancer patients can develop visceral, somatic, and neuropathic pain, largely due to the malignancy itself and its treatments. Often cancer patients and survivors turn to the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) to alleviate pain and fatigue. Thus, it is necessary to investigate how CAM therapies work as novel analgesics to treat cancer pain. Ojeok-san (OJS) is an herbal formula consisting of seventeen herbs. This herbal formula has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory, immunoregulatory, and analgesic properties. In this study, we examined the potential beneficial effects and mechanism of action of OJS in a preclinical model of colitis-associated colorectal cancer. Male and female C57BL/6J mice were exposed to the carcinogen, azoxymethane (AOM, 10 mg/kg) and a chemical inflammatory driver, dextran sulfate sodium (DSS1-2%), to promote tumorigenesis in the colorectum. OJS was given orally (500, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg) to determine its influence on disease activity, tumor burden, nociception, sedation, Erk signaling, and behavioral and metabolic outcomes. In addition, in vitro studies were performed to assess CT-26 cell viability, dorsal root ganglia (DRG) activation, and bone-marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM) inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide stimulation after OJS treatment. We found that administration of 2000 mg/kg of OJS was able to mitigate mechanical somatic and visceral nociception via Erk signaling without affecting symptom score and polyp number. Moreover, we discovered that OJS has sedative properties and elicits prolonged total sleeping time in AOM/DSS mice. Our in vitro experiments showed that OJS has the capacity to reduce TNFÎ± gene expression in LPS-stimulated BMDM, but no changes were observed in DRG spike number and CT-26 cell proliferation. Taken together, these data suggest that OJS ameliorates nociception in mice and warrants further examination as a potential CAM therapy to promote analgesia."

https://openalex.org/W4283319034,"The growing demand for natural pigments in the industrial sector is a significant driving force in the development of production processes. The production of natural blue pigments, which have wide industrial applications, using microbial systems has been gaining significant attention. In this study, we used Aspergillus oryzae as a platform cell factory to produce the blue pigment indigoidine (InK), by genetic manipulation of its non-ribosomal peptide synthetase system to overexpress the indigoidine synthetase gene ( AoinK ). Phenotypic analysis showed that InK production from the engineered strain was growth associated, owing to the constitutive control of gene expression. Furthermore, the initial pH, temperature, and glutamine and MgSO 4 concentrations were key factors affecting InK production by the engineered strain. The pigment secretion was enhanced by addition of 1% Tween 80 solution to the culture medium. The maximum titer of total InK was 1409.22 Â± 95.33 mg/L, and the maximum productivity was 265.09 Â± 14.74 mg/LÂ·d. Moreover, the recombinant InK produced by the engineered strain exhibited antioxidant activity. These results indicate that A . oryzae has the potential to be used as a fungal platform for overproduction of extracellular non-ribosomal peptide pigments."
https://openalex.org/W4283329862,"Skeletal muscles can regenerate over the lifetime from resident muscle stem cells (MuSCs). Interactions between MuSCs and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins are essential for muscle regeneration. The best-known receptors for ECM proteins are integrins, a family composed of twenty-some heterodimeric combinations of an Î±- and a Î²-subunit. Î²1-integrin (encoded by Itgb1) is required for quiescence, proliferation, migration, and fusion of Pax7+ MuSCs in the mouse model. Î²3-integrin (encoded by Itgb3) has been reported to be critical for the myogenic differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts, and Itgb3 germline mutant mice were shown to regenerate few if any myofibers after injury. To investigate the autonomous role of Itgb3 in the myogenic lineage in vivo, we conditionally inactivated a floxed Itgb3 allele (Itgb3F ) by constitutive Pax7-Cre and tamoxifen-inducible Pax7-CreERT2 drivers. Unexpectedly, we found no defects in muscle regeneration in both conditional knockout models. In vitro studies using Itgb3 mutant myoblasts or RNAi knockdown of Itgb3 in myoblasts also did not reveal a role for myogenic differentiation. As Î²1- and Î²3-integrins share ECM ligands and downstream signaling effectors, we further examined Itgb3's role in a Itgb1 haploid background. Still, we found no evidence for an autonomous role of Itgb3 in muscle regeneration in vivo. Thus, while Itgb3 is critical for the differentiation of C2C12 cells, the regenerative defects reported for the Itgb3 germline mutant are not due to its role in the MuSC. We conclude that if Î²3-integrin does have a role in Pax7+ MuSCs, it is compensated by Î²1- and/or another Î²-integrin(s)."

We compared the prediction error, the absolute error, and the percentages within Â± 0.5 D and Â±1.0 D of the targeted refraction, 3 months postoperatively, and also investigated the relationship of the prediction error with the keratometric readings and axial length, using the two formulas.The prediction error using the SRK/T formula was significantly more myopic than that using the Barrett Universal II formula (paired t-test, p<0.001). The absolute error using the Barrett Universal II formula was significantly smaller than that using the SRK/T formula (p = 0.039). We found significant correlations of the prediction error with the axial length (Pearson correlation coefficient, r = 0.273, p = 0.042), and the keratometric readings (r = -0.317, p = 0.017), using SRK/T formula, but no significant correlations between them (r = 0.219, p = 0.167, and r = -0.023, p = 0.870), using the Barrett Universal II formula.The Barrett Universal II formula provides a better predictability of IOL power calculation and is less susceptible to the effect of the axial length and the corneal shape, than the SRK/T formula. The Barrett Universal formula, rather than the SRK/T formula, may be clinically helpful for improving the refractive accuracy in such eyes."

Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is one of the measures recommended to avert this risk. However, there is limited evidence of HCPs' awareness of hepatitis B PEP. Therefore, this study aimed to establish awareness of hepatitis B PEP among HCPs in Wakiso, a peri-urban district that surrounds Uganda's capital, Kampala.A total of 306 HCPs, selected from 55 healthcare facilities (HCFs) were interviewed using a validated structured questionnaire. The data were collected and entered using the Kobo Collect mobile application. Multivariable binary logistic regression was used to establish the factors associated with awareness of hepatitis B PEP.Of the 306 HCPs, 93 (30.4%) had ever heard about hepatitis B PEP and 16 (5.2%) had ever attended training where they were taught about hepatitis B PEP. Only 10.8% were aware of any hepatitis B PEP options, with 19 (6.2%) and 14 (4.6%) mentioning hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and hepatitis B vaccine, respectively as PEP options. Individuals working in the maternity department were less likely to be aware of hepatitis B PEP (AOR = 0.10, 95% CI = 0.02-0.53). There was a positive association between working in a healthcare facility in an urban setting and awareness of hepatitis B PEP (AOR = 5.48, 95% CI = 1.42-21.20). Hepatitis B screening and vaccination were not associated with awareness of PEP.Only one-tenth of the HCPs were aware of any hepatitis B PEP option. Awareness of hepatitis B PEP is associated with the main department of work and working in a healthcare facility in an urban setting. This study suggests a need to sensitise HCPs, especially those in rural HCFs and maternity wards on hepatitis B PEP. The use of innovative strategies such as e-communication channels, including mobile text messaging might be paramount in bridging the awareness gap."
https://openalex.org/W3181107731,"Science advances by pushing the boundaries of the adjacent possible. While the global scientific enterprise grows at an exponential pace, at the mesoscopic level the exploration and exploitation of research ideas are reflected through the rise and fall of research fields. The empirical literature has largely studied such dynamics on a case-by-case basis, with a focus on explaining how and why communities of knowledge production evolve. Although fields rise and fall on different temporal and population scales, they are generally argued to pass through a common set of evolutionary stages. To understand the social processes that drive these stages beyond case studies, we need a way to quantify and compare different fields on the same terms. In this paper we develop techniques for identifying common patterns in the evolution of scientific fields and demonstrate their usefulness using 1.5 million preprints from the arXiv repository covering 175 research fields spanning Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science, Quantitative Biology and Quantitative Finance. We show that fields consistently follow a rise and fall pattern captured by a two parameters right-tailed Gumbel temporal distribution. We introduce a field-specific re-scaled time and explore the generic properties shared by articles and authors at the creation, adoption, peak, and decay evolutionary phases. We find that the early phase of a field is characterized by disruptive works mixing of cognitively distant fields written by small teams of interdisciplinary authors, while late phases exhibit the role of specialized, large teams building on the previous works in the field. This method provides foundations to quantitatively explore the generic patterns underlying the evolution of research fields in science, with general implications in innovation studies."

https://openalex.org/W4283312154,"Eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and its phosphorylated form (p-eIF4E) play a crucial role in the protein synthesis, both are under regulation of eIF4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-interacting kinases (MNKs). This study aims to explore the potential prognostic significance of p-4EBP1 and p-eIF4E in NSCLC patients. The expression of p-4EBP1 and p-eIF4E in NSCLC patients was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining in tissue microarrays (TMAs) containing 354 NSCLC and 53 non-cancerous lung tissues (Non-CLT). The overexpression percentage of p-4EBP1 and p-eIF4E in lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma (ADC) was significantly higher than that of Non-CLT. P-4EBP1 expression in patients with advanced clinical stage was higher than that in early stage. Expression of p-4EBP1 had a positive relationship with p-eIF4E expression both in lung SCC and ADC. NSCLC patients with high expression of p-4EBP1 and p-eIF4E alone or in combination had a lower survival rate than that of other phenotypes. For NSCLC patients, p-4EBP1 is an independent poor prognostic factor as well as clinical stage, LNM and pathological grade. Overexpression of p-4EBP1 and p-eIF4E might be novel prognostic marker for NSCLC, who possesses potential application value for NSCLC targeted therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4283321663,"Background The aim of this study was to characterize three regions of interest (ROI) around the knee with a portable 3D scanner (Artec 3D scanner EVA). Soft tissue topography assessment with an optimized, precise, and reproducible method may assist surgeons when managing soft tissue swelling in the post traumatic setting. Methods 12 healthy volunteers (24 legs, 7 women, 5 man) were included in this study. The patient cohort showed a mean age of 27.1 years (SDÂ±3), a mean weight of 70 kg (SDÂ±13) and a mean height of 171 cm (SDÂ±8.8). All scans were recorded by the same examiner in the same room and with the same scanner (Artec, 3 D scanner EVA). Three volume regions of interest (ROI) were defined: the distal femur (circumference measured between the of superior extent of the patella to 10 cm proximal), the knee joint (measured from the top of the patella to the tibial tuberosity) and the proximal tibia (tibial tuberosity to 10 cm distal). Results The mean volume of the right leg was 3.901 l (I. distal femur: 1.63 l, knee joint: 1.33 l, proximal tibia: 1.10 l) and mean volume of the left leg was 3.910 l (I. distal femur: 1.66 l, knee joint: 1.34 l, proximal tibia: 1.12 l). The volume difference between the right and left leg was 0.094 l (SD Â± 0.083 l) The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test showed no significant differences of the volumes between the right and left leg. Conclusions This study demonstrates that portable 3D scanning could be an accurate and reliable tool for orthopedics and trauma surgeons. Based on the ROIs of this pilot study, further studies are needed to test the significance for clinical applications for patients with an injured knee."
https://openalex.org/W4283368696,"A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a machine learning model that learns the relationship between elements of an input series, in addition to inferring a relationship between the data input to the model and target output. Memory augmentation allows the RNN to learn the interrelationships between elements of the input over a protracted length of the input series. Inspired by the success of stack augmented RNN (StackRNN) to generate strings for various applications, we present two memory augmented RNN-based architectures: the Neural Turing Machine (NTM) and the Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC) for the de-novo generation of small molecules. We trained a character-level convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the properties of a generated string and compute a reward or loss in a deep reinforcement learning setup to bias the Generator to produce molecules with the desired property. Further, we compare the performance of these architectures to gain insight to their relative merits in terms of the validity and novelty of the generated molecules and the degree of property bias towards the computational generation of de-novo drugs. We also compare the performance of these architectures with simpler recurrent neural networks (Vanilla RNN, LSTM, and GRU) without an external memory component to explore the impact of augmented memory in the task of de-novo generation of small molecules."
https://openalex.org/W4283382310,"The role and the degree to which environment and geographic isolation contribute to phenotypic diversity has been widely debated. Here, we studied phenotypic variation (morphology and plumage reflectance) in the Sinaloa Wren, an endemic bird distributed throughout the tropical dry forest (TDF) on the Mexican pacific slope where a pronounced variability in environmental conditions has been reported. In particular, we aimed: 1) to characterize phenotypic variation between subspecies; 2) to analyze the relationship between phenotypic and environmental variation in the context of classic ecogeographic rules, such as Bergmann's, Allen's, Gloger's, and Bogert's, and to quantify the relative roles of environment and geographic isolation and their interaction in shaping phenotypic variation; and 3) to test for niche conservatism between subspecies. Our data revealed significant differences among subspecies morphology and plumage reflectance. The environment explained a higher proportion of the morphological variation, while geography explained a smaller proportion. However, variation in plumage reflectance was mainly explained by the joint effect of geography and environment. Our data did not support for BergmannÂ´s and AllenÂ´s rule. However, longer tails and wings were positively associated with higher elevations, larger tarsus and culmens were positively related to higher latitudes and to greater tree cover, respectively. Our data partially supported GlogerÂ´s rule, where darker plumages were associated with more humid environments. The effects of temperature on plumage coloration were more consistent with BogertÂ´s rule. In addition, we found darker plumages related to higher levels of UV-B radiation. Finally, niche divergence was detected between T. s. cinereus and T. s. sinaloa vs. T. s. russeus. In a continuously distributed ecosystem such as the TDF on the pacific slope of Mexico, the environmental conditions and geographic isolation have played an important role in promoting phenotypic differentiation in the Sinaloa Wren."

https://openalex.org/W4283326274,"Objective This study examined long-term outcomes of biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) and tofacitinib discontinuation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods Ninety-seven RA patients who desired drug discontinuation after sustained remission or low disease activity for at least 48 weeks due to stable treatment with biological drugs or tofacitinib were enrolled into this study. All patients were prospectively followed until disease flare or the end of the study. Discontinued drugs (previous drugs) were reintroduced to treat flares. Results Following bDMARD/tofacitinib discontinuation (mean follow-up, 2.1 years; standard deviation, 2.0), disease flare occurred at a crude incidence rate of 0.36 per person-year. The median time to flare was 1.6 years (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.9â€“2.6), and the cumulative flare probability was estimated to be 45% at 1 year, 64% at 3 years, and 80% at 5 years. No or little radiological progression was shown in 87.1% of patients who maintained remission for 3 years. A Fineâ€’Gray competing risk regression analysis showed that predictive factors for a flare were longer RA duration at the start of bDMARD/tofacitinib treatment, previous failure of treatment with bDMARDs, and a shorter period of remission or low disease activity before drug discontinuation. Type of discontinued drug was not identified as a predictive factor after adjusting for other predictor variables. Restarting previous treatment regimens led to rapidly regaining disease control in 89% of flare patients within 1 month. Conclusion Discontinuation of bDMARD/tofacitinib may be a feasible strategy in RA patients, especially patients with early treated and longer-controlled RA. Flares are manageable in most RA patients and radiological progression is rare for at least 3 years in patients with sustained remission after bDMARD/tofacitinib discontinuation."
https://openalex.org/W4283331810,"Micro-anatomical reentry has been identified as a potential driver of atrial fibrillation (AF). In this paper, we introduce a novel computational method which aims to identify which atrial regions are most susceptible to micro-reentry. The approach, which considers the structural basis for micro-reentry only, is based on the premise that the accumulation of electrically insulating interstitial fibrosis can be modelled by simulating percolation-like phenomena on spatial networks. Our results suggest that at high coupling, where micro-reentry is rare, the micro-reentrant substrate is highly clustered in areas where the atrial walls are thin and have convex wall morphology, likely facilitating localised treatment via ablation. However, as transverse connections between fibres are removed, mimicking the accumulation of interstitial fibrosis, the substrate becomes less spatially clustered, and the bias to forming in thin, convex regions of the atria is reduced, possibly restricting the efficacy of localised ablation. Comparing our algorithm on image-based models with and without atrial fibre structure, we find that strong longitudinal fibre coupling can suppress the micro-reentrant substrate, whereas regions with disordered fibre orientations have an enhanced risk of micro-reentry. With further development, these methods may be useful for modelling the temporal development of the fibrotic substrate on an individualised basis."
https://openalex.org/W4283331953,"The recent SARS CoV-02 pandemic has put enormous pressure on intensive care staff, making it imperative to relieve them of repetitive tasks with little added value such as drug replenishment. We propose a decision support system based on a hybrid policy to manage the inventory of critical drugs with low and intermittent demand at an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Demand forecasting is at the heart of any inventory policy. We claim that in the ICU setting drug demand patterns must be therapy based. Heterogeneous data have been collected during an on site study, and information have been extracted to provide a faithful abstract representation of the ward as a system, as well as the potential evolutions of ICU patients clinical conditions. Together with medical guidelines, this provides the foundation of a therapy based demand forecasting tool. This study integrates schedule optimization and demand forecasting, and exploits simulation for evaluation purpose in the long run. At the beginning of every period, drug orders are optimally scheduled with respect to forecast demand. Then, scheduled orders are deployed day by day and confronted with the real demand in a simulated environment. Potential stock outs trigger rush orders to restore safety stocks. The comparison between the proposed policy and a standard policy mimicking current practice in an ICU ward shows that information on therapy patterns can be successfully incorporated into drug replenishment processes to reduce the number of rush orders, a primary goal in designing an efficient system."

https://openalex.org/W4283372040,"Our understanding of atmosphere formation essentially relies on noble gases and their isotopes, with xenon (Xe) being a key tracer of the early planetary stages. A long-standing issue, however, is the origin of atmospheric depletion in Xe1 and its light isotopes for the Earth2 and Mars3. Here we report that feldspar and olivine samples confined at high pressures and high temperature with diluted Xe and krypton (Kr) in air or nitrogen are enriched in heavy Xe isotopes by +0.8 to +2.3â€° per AMU, and strongly enriched in Xe over Kr. The upper +2.3â€° per AMU value is a minimum because quantitative trapping of unreacted Xe, either in bubbles or adsorbed on the samples, is likely. In light of these results, we propose a scenario solving the missing Xe problem that involves multiple magma ocean stage events at the proto-planetary stage, combined with atmospheric loss. Each of these events results in trapping of Xe at depth and preferential retention of its heavy isotopes. In the case of the Earth, the heavy Xe fraction was later added to the secondary CI chondritic atmosphere through continental erosion and/or recycling of a Hadean felsic crust."

https://openalex.org/W4283381593,"For brain-computer interfaces, resolving the differences between pre-movement and movement requires decoding neural ensemble activity in the motor cortex's functional regions and behavioural patterns. Here, we explored the underlying neural activity and mechanisms concerning a grasped motor task by recording electroencephalography (EEG) signals during the execution of hand movements in healthy subjects. The grasped movement included different tasks; reaching the target, grasping the target, lifting the object upwards, and moving the object in the left or right directions. 163 trials of EEG data were acquired from 30 healthy participants who performed the grasped movement tasks. Rhythmic EEG activity was analysed during the premovement (alert task) condition and compared against grasped movement tasks while the arm was moved towards the left or right directions. The short positive to negative deflection that initiated around -0.5ms as a wave before the onset of movement cue can be used as a potential biomarker to differentiate movement initiation and movement. A rebound increment of 14% of beta oscillations and 26% gamma oscillations in the central regions was observed and could be used to distinguish pre-movement and grasped movement tasks. Comparing movement initiation to grasp showed a decrease of 10% in beta oscillations and 13% in gamma oscillations, and there was a rebound increment 4% beta and 3% gamma from grasp to grasped movement. We also investigated the combination MRCPs and spectral estimates of Î±, Î², and Î³ oscillations as features for machine learning classifiers that could categorize movement conditions. Support vector machines with 3rd order polynomial kernel yielded 70% accuracy. Pruning the ranked features to 5 leaf nodes reduced the error rate by 16%. For decoding grasped movement and in the context of BCI applications, this study identifies potential biomarkers, including the spatio-temporal characteristics of MRCPs, spectral information, and choice of classifiers for optimally distinguishing initiation and grasped movement."
