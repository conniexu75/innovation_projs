Increased expression was associated with an increase in the binding of Nrf2 to electrophile response elements (EpRE) in the promoters of these genes. Nrf2 overexpression increased the activity of GCSh and GCSl promoter/reporter transgenes. Overexpression of an MafK dominant negative mutant decreased Nrf2 binding to GCS EpRE sequences, inhibited the inducible expression of GCSh and GCSlpromoter/reporter transgenes, and reduced endogenous GCS gene induction. β-NF and PDTC exposure also increased steady-state levels of MafG mRNA. In addition to Nrf2, small Maf and JunD proteins were detected in GCShEpRE-protein complexes and, to a lesser extent, in GCSlEpRE-protein complexes. The Nrf2-associated expression of GCS promoter/reporter transgenes was inhibited by overexpression of MafG. Inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide partially decreased inducibility by PDTC or β-NF and resulted in significant increases in GCS mRNA at late time points, when GCS mRNA levels are normally declining. We hypothesize that, in response to β-NF and PDTC, the GCS subunit genes are transcriptionally up-regulated by Nrf2-basic leucine zipper complexes, containing either JunD or small Maf protein, depending on the particular GCS EpRE target sequence and the inducer. Following maximal induction, down-regulation of the two genes is mediated via a protein synthesis-dependent mechanism.

The steady-state messenger RNA levels corresponding to the GCS catalytic and regulatory subunit genes are increased following exposure of cells to a wide variety of xenobiotics, including β-naphthoflavone (β-NF) (2Mulcahy R.T.

Many of these agents are also potent inducers of phase II enzymes and have been reported to initiate a protective response, designated the “electrophile counterattack” (8Prestera T. Zhang Y. Spencer S.R. Wilczak C.A. Talalay P. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1993; 33: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), characterized by both the increase in intracellular glutathione and the up-regulation of detoxification genes via antioxidant response elements (ARE)/electrophile response elements (EpRE) located in the promoter regions of the respective genes. The increase in intracellular GSH levels and the increased expression of the GCS genes following exposure to phase II enzyme inducers implicate GCS subunit gene induction as an important event in mobilizing the xenobiotic stress response. Consequently, we have been investigating the regulation of the genes encoding the catalytic (or heavy, 73 kDa) and regulatory (or light, 31 kDa) subunits of GCS. We previously demonstrated that the basal and β-NF-induced expression of the gene encoding the human GCS catalytic subunit (GCSh) is mediated via an electrophile response element, designated EpRE4, located approximately 3.1 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site (2Mulcahy R.T. Wartman M.A. Bailey H.H. Gipp J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7445-7454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Expression of the GCS regulatory subunit gene (GCSl) was likewise shown to be under the control of an EpRE sequence, located 0.3 kb upstream of the translational start site (9Moinova H.R. Mulcahy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14683-14689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In contrast to the GCSh gene, in which β-NF induction is mediated solely by EpRE4, induction of the GCSl subunit gene in response to β-NF is also influenced by a second cis-element, an AP-1 binding sequence 32 base pairs upstream of the EpRE. Originally identified in the promoter of the rat NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) gene, the ARE was shown to mediate gene induction by phenolic antioxidants and was named accordingly (10Rushmore T.H. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14648-14653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Talalay and colleagues (11Talalay P. DeLong M.J. Prochaska H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

They further established a strong correlation between electrophilicity and potency as inducing agents and hence preferred to designate elements satisfying the ARE consensus sequence as EpRE (13Prestera T. Talalay P. Alam J. Ahn Y.I. Lee P.J. Choi A.M.K. Mol. Med. 1995; 1: 827-837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as previously suggested by Friling and colleagues (14Friling R.S. Bensimon A. Tichauer Y. Daniel V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6258-6262Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Since these original reports, EpREs have been identified and characterized in the promoter regions of a number of genes, including human and ratNQO1 (15Jaiswal A.K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10647-10653Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 16Favreau L.V. Pickett C.B. J. Biol.

Med. 1995; 1: 827-837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as the genes encoding the catalytic and regulatory subunits of human GCS (2Mulcahy R.T. Wartman M.A. Bailey H.H. Gipp J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7445-7454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 9Moinova H.R. Mulcahy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14683-14689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). EpREs confer high basal expression and mediate xenobiotic inducibility of genes possessing the sequence within their promoters (17Rushmore T.H. Morton M.R. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11632-11639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The EpRE core sequence (5′-(G/C)TGA(C/G)NNNGC(A/G)-3′) may contain an embedded AP-1-binding site and is often flanked by AP-1 or AP-1-like sequences. It has been noted that the primary sequence of the EpRE is similar to that of other response elements, including the TRE-type Maf recognition elements (T-MARE) and the NF-E2-binding sites, suggesting that transcription factors recognizing these sequences may bind to and regulate expression through EpRE sequences (18Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kerppola T.K. Curran T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3149-3158PubMed Google Scholar). The sequences are so comparable that it has been suggested that EpRE sequences may, in fact, constitute a subset of the T-MARE regulatory sequences (9Moinova H.R. Mulcahy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14683-14689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar,20Motohashi H. Shavit J.A. Igarashi K. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2953-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The interpretation of studies designed to identify thosetrans-acting factors capable of specifically recognizing the EpRE regulatory sequences to affect gene expression has been complex. Several experimental approaches to address this question have been utilized, although most investigators have relied on electromobility supershift assays and the evaluation of EpRE-directed reporter gene expression following manipulation of transcription factor expression. These studies have implicated AP-1 family members JunB, JunD, c-Fos, Fra1, Fra2, and NF-E2 family members Nrf1 and Nrf2 as regulators of genes containing EpRE promoter sequences (21Li Y. Jaiswal A.K.

A number of investigators have also identified novel EpRE-binding proteins by direct purification, describing a 74.3-kDa protein (YABP) recognizing the rat GST Ya subunit gene EpRE (29Nguyen T. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13535-13539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Liu S. Pickett C.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11517-11521Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), a 160-kDa protein complex binding the human NQO1 EpRE isolated from Hela nuclear extracts (31Wang B. Williamson G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 645-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), an 80-kDa protein from murine smooth muscle cells recognizing an EpRE in the c-Ha-ras gene promoter (32Bral C.M. Ramos K.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 974-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and a unique 160-kDa protein, identified as ARE-binding protein 1 (33Wasserman W.W. Fahl W.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 344: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, the similarity of the EpRE sequence and that of the T-MARE has led to the proposal that small Maf and its heterodimerization partners, such as Nrf1 and Nrf2, can mediate expression through EpRE sequences. Nrf1 and Nrf2 belong to the Cap “n” Collar subfamily of bZip transcription factors (34Chan J.Y. Han X.-L. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11371-11375Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 35Moi P. Chan K. Asunis I. Cao A. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9926-9930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). As is the case for p45 NF-E2, the founding member of this family, neither Nrf1 nor Nrf2 form homodimers that effectively bind DNA (27Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y.

Rather, NF-E2 family members, including Nrf1 and Nrf2, heterodimerize with bZip factors, including the small Maf proteins (27Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T.

Chem. 1997; 272: 16490-16497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Small Maf proteins compose a family of transcription factors identified by their homology to the avian transforming retroviral oncogene, v-maf (musculo-aponeurotic fibrosarcoma) (36Kataoka K. Igarashi K. Itoh K. Fujiwara K.T. Noda M. Yamamoto M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2180-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 41Fujiwara K.T. Kataoka K. Nishizawa M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2371-2380PubMed Google Scholar). The small Maf proteins, including MafK, MafG, and MafF, are distinct from the large Maf family members in that they lack amino-terminal transactivation domains. The small Maf proteins can form maf:maf homo- and heterodimers to negatively regulate transcription (20Motohashi H. Shavit J.A. Igarashi K. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D.

Nature. 1994; 367: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). When heterodimerized with bZip factors containing transactivation domains, such as Fos, Bach1, Bach2, NF-E2 p45, Nrf1, and Nrf2, the small Maf factors facilitate DNA binding to T-MARE sequences and result in transactivation (20Motohashi H.

In support of the hypothesis that small Maf/Nrf heterodimers bind to and direct expression through phase II enzyme EpRE sequences, Itoh and colleagues (27Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the induction of phase II enzymes by the phenolic antioxidant butylated hydroxyanisole was decreased in the liver and intestine of nrf2-null mice. In the experiments presented here, we demonstrate that the transcription factor Nrf2 is a positive regulator of EpRE-dependent GCS subunit gene expression in cells exposed to β-NF and PDTC. Our findings suggest that JunD and small Maf proteins may mediate GCS gene inducibility under certain conditions, following heterodimerization with Nrf2. Consistent with this hypothesis, we report that the expression of MafG is increased in response to β-NF and PDTC, at time points preceding GCS subunit gene induction. We provide evidence that the small Maf proteins may also negatively regulate GCS gene expression; the opposing positive and negative effects of the small Maf proteins on GCS gene expression may reflect changes in the dynamic equilibrium between the formation of small Maf/bZip hetero- and Maf/Maf homodimers, respectively. Furthermore, we find that protein synthesis is required for full inducibility of the GCS subunit genes by β-NF or PDTC and may be necessary for the subsequent down-regulation of GCS subunit gene expression observed following gene induction by these agents. The recombinant expression vectors −3802/GCSh 5′-luc and −1927/GCSl5′-luc were constructed by cloning the 4.2-kbHindIII/NcoI and the 1.9-kb NcoI genomic restriction fragments isolated from the 5′-flanking sequence of the GCSh and GCSl genes, respectively, into pGL3-Basic (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) (2Mulcahy R.T.

The pGL3-Basic vector used in these studies was mutated by a single base substitution to eliminate the AP-1-binding site located near the ampicillin resistance gene (45Wild A.C. Gipp J.J. Mulcahy R.T. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). pCI-Nrf2neo was constructed by isolating the 2.3-kbEcoRI fragment containing the human Nrf2 cDNA by partial digestion from pCRII (obtained from Dr. Etsuro Ito, Hirosaki University) and ligating the fragment into pCIneo (Promega Corp.). A 1.6-kb EcoRI fragment of the human MafG cDNA was excised from the plasmid pMT2 containing the MafG cDNA (obtained from Dr. Nancy Andrews, Harvard University) and was cloned into pCIneo to generate pCI-MafGneo. The pCMV-JunD expression vector was created by blunt-end ligation of the 1.7-kb KpnI/SacI fragment containing human JunD cDNA (ATCC, Rockville, MD) into the vector pCMVβ (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA), following NotI excision of the β-galactosidase cDNA insert. The MafK dominant negative mutant (MafK DN) was generated by mutation of conserved bases in the MafK DNA binding domain by Kotkow and Orkin (46Kotkow K.J. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4640-4647Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). For the current studies, the dominant negative mutant cDNA was excised with NotI from the pEF1α-neo plasmid in which it was provided (from Dr. Stuart Orkin, Harvard University) and recloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). pCDNA3 expression vectors containing the dominant negative mutant cDNA in the reverse and forward orientations were isolated and were used in transient transfection studies. The expression vector, pRc/CMV-AFos, containing the AP-1 dominant negative mutant, AFos, was designed by Olive et al. (47Olive M. Krylov D. Echlin D.R. Gardner K. Taparowsky E. Vinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18586-18594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) by elimination of the DNA binding domain of c-Fos and the addition of an amphipathic acidic extension to the leucine zipper region followed by cloning of the resultant mutant sequence into pRc/CMV (Invitrogen). We monitored the function of the transiently expressed AFos mutant by measuring the pT81–4XAP-1 reporter constitutive activity, and its expression in response to 60 ng/ml 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) for 16 h. The pT81–4XAP-1 plasmid was generated by annealing complementary synthetic oligonucleotides containing the sequence 5′- GGATGAGTAACGGTTACTAAGG-3′ (AP-1-binding site, underlined) and ligating the double-stranded product into the pT81 vector (ATCC) digested with SmaI, as described previously (2Mulcahy R.T.

The resulting construct contained four tandem AP-1-binding sites cloned upstream of the tk promoter, driving luciferase expression. Plasmids used for stable transfection experiments include the pUHD10–3-hyg plasmid, created by ligation of a 1.8-kb MaeI fragment, from the vector p3′SS (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), containing the hygromycin resistance gene, into the HindIII site of pUHD10–3 (48Gossen M.

The pUHD10–3/MafK DN plasmid was generated by cloning the 0.5-kb EcoRI fragment containing the MafK DN mutant cDNA from pCDNA3/MafK DN into the EcoRI site of pUHD10–3. HepG2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. Cells were transiently transfected with recombinant plasmids using a standard calcium phosphate-glycerol shock procedure, as described previously (2Mulcahy R.T. Wartman M.A. Bailey H.H. Gipp J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7445-7454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). When varying concentrations of the transcription factor expression vectors were used within an experiment, as indicated in the figure legends, total DNA concentration was corrected by addition of the pCIneo vector (Promega Corp.). To normalize for transfection efficiency, either pCMVβ (49MacGregor G.R. Caskey C.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) or pRSVβ-galactosidase, each containing thelacZ gene encoding β-galactosidase, was co-transfected with each recombinant plasmid group. β-NF (Sigma) was dissolved in Me2SO at a concentration of 10 mm and diluted 1000-fold (final Me2SO concentration = 0.1%) by addition to complete medium. PDTC (Sigma) was dissolved in water and diluted in medium to a final concentration of 100 μm. To initiate treatment of HepG2 cells with either agent, culture medium was replaced with fresh complete medium containing Me2SO (0.1% v/v), 10 μm β-NF, or 100 μm PDTC. Cells were harvested at various times after addition of PDTC or β-NF and prepared for determination of luciferase and β-galactosidase activity and protein concentration, as described previously (2Mulcahy R.T. Wartman M.A. Bailey H.H. Gipp J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7445-7454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). To establish a HepG2 cell line conditionally expressing the MafK DN mutant, we used the tetracycline-regulated expression system (Life Technologies, Inc.). HepG2 cells were initially co-transfected with the tetracycline-responsive transactivator plasmid pTet.tTAk and with pCMV-neo (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.), conferring resistance to geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Following G418 selection, pTet.tTAk-positive clones were selected by screening for transactivation of the transiently expressed pTet.tTAk-responsive pUHC13-3 luciferase reporter in the absence of doxycycline treatment. The resulting HepG2 clone was then stably co-transfected with pUHD10–3-hyg, conferring resistance to hygromycin B (Calbiochem) and either the empty pUHD10–3 vector or the pUHD10–3/MafK DN construct in a 1:10 molar ratio, respectively. Transfectants were exposed to 600 μg/ml hygromycin B followed by clonal selection. Complementary oligonucleotides containing GCS EpRE sequences were prepared for use as probes, as specified previously (45Wild A.C. Gipp J.J. Mulcahy R.T. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Sequences of the probes were as follows: GCSh EpRE4, 5′-CTCCCCGTGACTCAGCGCTTTG-3′; GCSl EpRE, 5′-GGAAGACAATGACTAAGCAGAAAATCGTAGCCG-3′; and GCSh EpRE4 m1, 5′-CTCCCCGGGACTCAGCGCTTTG-3′ (base substitution underlined). Nuclear extracts were prepared, as described by Dignam et al. (50Digman J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 11: 1475-1489Google Scholar), from HepG2 cells treated with 0.1% Me2SO or 25 μm β-NF for 6 h or with 100 μm PDTC for 1–3 h. For supershift analyses, the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe and 10 μg of nuclear extract were incubated for 20 min prior to the addition of antisera which was followed by a 30-min incubation at room temperature (45Wild A.C. Gipp J.J. Mulcahy R.T. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The Nrf2 and JunD antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and were used according to the recommended procedure. We obtained antisera to MafG protein from two sources, from Dr. Nancy Andrews and Dr. Volker Blank (51Blank V. Kim M.J. Andrews N.C. Blood. 1997; 89: 3925-3935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and from Dr. Kazuhiko Igarashi. Total cellular RNA was isolated from HepG2 cells using TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH) according to the recommended procedure. RNA quantitation was accomplished using the RPAII system (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX), as described (2Mulcahy R.T. Wartman M.A. Bailey H.H. Gipp J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7445-7454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). For Northern blot analyses, 2 μg of mRNA (isolated with the Poly(AT) Tract mRNA Isolation System (Promega Corp.)) or 10 μg of total RNA was size-fractionated in agarose formaldehyde gels, transferred to a charged nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and hybridized with either random primer labeled probe or with an in vitrotranscribed RNA probe. The DNA templates prepared for random primer labeling (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Rediprime II kit) included the 1.1-kb SmaI/EcoRI fragment from pCI-MafGneo encompassing the MafG 3′-untranslated region, the 1.3-kb Nrf2EcoRI fragment isolated from pCI-Nrf2neo, the 0.5-kbNotI fragment containing the MafK DN mutant cDNA from pcDNA3/MafK DN, and a 0.7-kb PstI 36B4 fragment. To generate run-off, transcripts corresponding to the 0.4-kbSmaI fragment from the coding region of the MafG cDNA,in vitro transcription reactions were"

Here, using a permeabilized-cell assay, we show that chemotactic stimuli cause neutrophils to organize many discrete sites of actin polymerization, the distribution of which is biased by external chemotactic gradients. Furthermore, the Arp2/3 complex, which can nucleate actin polymerization, dynamically redistributes to the region of living neutrophils that receives maximal chemotactic stimulation, and the least-extractable pool of the Arp2/3 complex co-localizes with sites of actin polymerization. Our observations indicate that chemoattractant-stimulated neutrophils may establish discrete foci of actin polymerization that are similar to those generated at the posterior surface of the intracellular bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. We propose that asymmetrical establishment and/or maintenance of sites of actin polymerization produces directional migration of neutrophils in response to chemotactic gradients."

https://openalex.org/W2030553086,"Activation of the superoxide-producing phagocyte NADPH oxidase requires interaction between p47 phox and p22 phox, which is mediated via the SH3 domains of the former protein. This interaction is considered to be induced by exposure of the domains that are normally masked by an intramolecular interaction with the C-terminal region of p47 phox. Here we locate the intramolecular SH3-binding site at the region of amino acid residues 286–340, where Ser-303, Ser-304, and Ser-328 that are among several serines known to become phosphorylated upon cell stimulation exist. Simultaneous replacement of the three serines in p47 phox with aspartates or glutamates, each mimicking phosphorylated residues, is sufficient for disruption of the intramolecular interaction and resultant access to p22 phox. The triply mutated proteins are also capable of activating the NADPH oxidase without in vitro activators such as arachidonate under cell-free conditions. In a whole-cell system where expression of the wild-type p47 phox reconstitutes the stimulus-dependent oxidase activity, substitution of the kinase-insensitive residue alanine for Ser-328 as well as for Ser-303/Ser-304 leads to a defective production of superoxide. These findings suggest that phosphorylation of the three serines in p47 phox induces a conformational change to a state accessible to p22 phox, thereby activating the NADPH oxidase."

Dengue virus type 2 (DEN2), the most prevalent of the four serotypes, contains a single-stranded RNA genome of positive polarity that encodes a single polyprotein precursor (3391 amino acid residues for DEN2, New Guinea C-strain) (4Irie K.

However, the mechanism of initiation of viral RNA synthesis as well as RNA genome replication in general and the role of host proteins in this process remain unclear for positive strand RNA viruses. In flavivirus-infected cells, three RNA species have been detected: a genomic RNA of 40–44 S; a double-stranded, RNase-resistant, replicative form of 20–22 S; and a partially RNase-sensitive, replicative intermediate of 20–28 S RNA (37Chu P.W.

These studies have examined incorporation of radiolabeled nucleotides into the three RNA species on endogenous viral RNA templates. In these replication complexes, the endogenous replicative intermediates present in the infected cell extracts were shown to form a double-stranded replicative form. The replicative form produced endogenously from replicative intermediate or added exogenously gave rise to a 44 S genome-size RNA species, suggesting that initiation of (+)-strand RNA synthesis occurred in these in vitro assays (39Chu P.W. Westaway E.G. Virology. 1987; 157: 330-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 40Bartholomeusz A.I. Wright P.J. Arch. Virol. 1993; 128: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To study the mechanism of viral replication in molecular detail, it is crucial to develop an in vitro RdRP assay that can utilize exogenous RNA templates containing essential regulatory elements of the viral genome involved in viral replication. For initiation of (−)- and (+)-strand RNA synthesis, conserved RNA sequences with intrinsic stem-loop structures from the 3′ and 5′ regions of many viral genomes are thought to play an important role in RNA replication (41Esteban R.

In flavivirus genomes, such conserved elements have been noted previously; their functions in replication remain to be established. For example, the 3′-terminal 96 nucleotides of the mosquito-borne flaviviruses within the 3′-UTR form a conserved and stable stem-loop structure, although the primary sequence is not conserved (for a review see Ref.8Chambers T.J. Hahn C.S. Galler R. Rice C.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 44: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar). Formation of such a stable secondary structure within the 3′-terminal 373 nt of the 3′-UTR was shown to exist in solution (56Mohan P.M. Padmanabhan R. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A potential secondary structure with a lesser predicted stability near the 5′ termini of several flavivirus RNAs including DEN2 was reported (57Brinton M.A. Dispoto J.H. Virology. 1988; 162: 290-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). There are also two short conserved sequences (CS1 and CS2) in 3′-UTR shared by all mosquito-borne flaviviruses; CS1, 26 nucleotides in length, is located 5′ to the stem-loop structure of the 3′-UTR (3′-CS1). A portion of the 3′-CS1 is complementary to a conserved element is located within the N-terminal coding region of the capsid protein, C, in the 5′-TR of the viral genome (5′-CS). It has been proposed that these complementary sequences might play a role in cyclization of the viral genome (Ref. 58Hahn C.S. Hahn Y.S. Rice C.M. Lee E. Dalgarno L. Strauss E.G. Strauss J.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar and for a review see Ref. 8Chambers T.J. Hahn C.S. Galler R. Rice C.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 44: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar). However, cyclization of any of the flavivirus genome has not been observed to date. Thus the role of cyclization motifs in genome replication is unknown at present. In this study, we report the development of the first in vitro RdRP assay that utilizes cell-free extracts of DEN2-infected mosquito (C6/36) cells and exogenous subgenomic RNA templates containing 5′- and/or 3′-terminal regions of the viral genome. The results indicate that there is an interaction between 5′- and 3′-terminal regions of the viral RNA that is required for RNA synthesisin vitro. This interaction is modulated by the complementary cyclization motifs. RNA synthesis occurs by the 3′-end elongation of the template RNA to yield a predominantly double-stranded RNA hairpin with a limited single-stranded loop region. The kinetics of the formation of the RNA hairpin product indicates that the template RNA is first modified yielding a RNase A-sensitive intermediate that is then converted to the hairpin product twice the size of the template RNA. This in vitro RdRP assay will be useful to study the sequence and protein requirements for RNA synthesis in vitro. Dengue virus type 2 (New Guinea Strain C) was propagated as described (59Yaegashi T. Vakharia V.N. Page K. Sasaguri Y. Feighny R. Padmanabhan R. Gene (Amst .). 1986; 46: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 60Smith T.J. Brandt W.E. Swanson J.L. McCown J.M. Buescher E.L. J. Virol. 1970; 5: 524-532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain the DEN2 viral replication complex, C6/36 cells were infected with DEN2 virus (multiplicity of infection = 5) in T-150 cm2 flasks for 36 h at 28 °C. Uninfected C6/36 cells were used as controls. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of TNMg buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm sodium acetate, 1.5 mmMgCl2) per T-150 cm2 flask. After passing the cell suspension 20 times through a syringe (one ml capacity), fitted with a 27-guage needle, the cell lysates were centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to fractionate the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions as described (39Chu P.W. Westaway E.G. Virology. 1987; 157: 330-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations of the cytoplasmic extracts were determined as described (61Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar), and the extracts were stored in aliquots at −70 °C until used. An aliquot of the cytoplasmic extract was mixed with an equal volume of a 2× sample loading buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 0.7 m β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10%) and transferred electrophoretically to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was treated with nonfat dry milk (5%) for 2 h in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20, pH 7.5, and then incubated overnight with polyclonal rabbit anti-NS3 or anti-NS5 antibodies (1:2000). The membranes were washed three times for 20 min each with this buffer and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:20000) for 2 h at room temperature. Chemiluminescence detection of the immunoreactive bands were performed as described by the manufacturer (ECL system; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The p190-24 plasmid contains the 3′-terminal 373 nt from the DEN2 cDNA and 26 nt from the pGEM7Zf+ vector (TCAAGCTATGCATCCAACGCGTTGGG) under the control of SP6 promoter (56Mohan P.M. Padmanabhan R. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). When this plasmid is linearized withXbaI, the cDNA of (−)-strand polarity was extended by 4 additional nucleotides of the XbaI-5′ overhang. The RNA synthesized from this template strand would include the 4 additional nucleotides complementary to this overhang at its 3′-end. To generate 3′-UTR373nt RNA, which contains the wild type cyclization sequence but without these 4 additional nucleotides, two approaches were followed. Firstly, a PCR approach was followed using the two oligonucleotide primers: the upstream 5′-primer (A), 5′-TGACCATGATTACGCCAAGCTATTTAGGTG-3′ anneals a region upstream of the SP6 promoter and a part of the promoter (underlined); the downstream 3′ primer (B), 5′-AGAACCTGTTGATTCAACAGCACC-3′ is complementary to the 3′-end of the viral genome. The PCR fragment was purified and used for in vitro transcription (see below). In the second approach, the XbaI-linearized p190-24 plasmid (10 μg in each reaction) was treated with increasing amounts of S1 nuclease (0, 3, 10, 30, 75, and 150 units) in 100 μl of reaction mixtures containing 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 28 mm NaCl, and 4.5 mm ZnSO4 at room temperature for 30′, extracted with phenol, and precipitated with ethanol. The S1 nuclease-treated plasmids were used for the in vitro transcription catalyzed by SP6 RNA polymerase. To ensure that the S1 nuclease precisely removed the XbaI overhang, the blunt ends were ligated by T4 DNA ligase and cloned. DNA sequencing was carried out using an automated DNA sequencer (Biotech Facility, University of Kansas Medical Center). A 230-nt DNA fragment from the 5′-terminal region that includes the 5′-UTR (96 nt), and the 5′-CS1 was generated by PCR using pMK4 as a template and the upstream primer (C), 5′-CGGAATTCGGATCGATCCCCCCTAATAC-3′ (containing the T7 promoter), and the downstream primer (D) 5′-CAGTTCCTGAGGTCCTCGTCCCTGCAG-3′ (complementary to 217–233 nt of the viral genome, which includes the 5′-CS1 element). The primers, C and D, contain the EcoRI andBsu36I sites (underlined), respectively. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and Bsu36I and purified using a Qiagen cartridge. The 3′-terminal fragment (800 nt) that includes the 3′-UTR was derived from the plasmid clone pGEM-PCR1.3 (4Irie K. Mohan P.M. Sasaguri Y. Putnak R. Padmanabhan R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 75: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) by digestion with Bsu36I (nt position 9885) and XbaI (nt position 10723). The pSP64 vector plasmid was digested at the multiple cloning site with EcoRI and XbaI. A three-fragment ligation and cloning yielded pSY-1 plasmid containing DEN2 cDNA sequences under the control of T7 promoter. To construct a plasmid encoding a shorter subgenomic RNA, the pSY-1 plasmid was partially digested with XmnI, followed by digestion withBsu36I. The overhang from the Bsu36I-cut plasmid was blunt-ended by treatment with E. coli Klenow DNA polymerase fragment and was cloned to yield the pSY-2 plasmid (720 nt) in which 348 nt from the pSY-1 was deleted but retaining all of 3′-UTR region. The pSY-1 and pSY-2 plasmids were used to produce the subgenomic RNAs of 1.0 kilobase and 720 nt, respectively, by in vitro transcription (Fig. 1). To construct a PCR fragment of 5′-TR/mutCYC (which contains substitution mutations within the cyclization sequence), a PCR-based mutagenesis protocol was followed. Two PCR products were generated with overlapping sequences using two sets of primers. PCR1 was obtained using the 5′-primer (E), containing the EcoRI site, 5′-AGCTATGACCATGATTACGAATTC-3′ that corresponds to the upstream region of the T7 promoter in the pSP64 vector and the 3′-primer (F), 5′-TTTCACAGAGAGAGAAGGCGTATTTCTCGCCTTT-3′. PCR2 was produced using the 5′ primer (G), 5′-GCCTTCTCTCTCTGTGAAACGCGAGAGAAACCG-3′, and the 3′ primer (H), 5′-TGAGGTCCTCGTCCTG-3′. The underlined complementary sequences in F and G primers represent the mutated cyclization element (mutCYC). The primer H shares identical sequences with pSY-1 plasmid in the vicinity of Bsu36I site (underlined). The two products, PCR1 and PCR2, produced using the primer sets E/F and G/H were purified, mixed, and used for a third PCR in the presence of the primer set E/H. This final PCR product was purified and used for in vitro transcription to generate 5′-TR/mutCYC RNA. To construct a PCR fragment containing the 3′-UTR373nt/mutCYC that contains mutations within the cyclization sequence complementary to that in 5′-TR/mutCYC), a PCR-based mutagenesis protocol was followed. PCR1 was obtained using the 5′-primer (A), the 3′-primer (I), 5′-CAGCGCTCTCTCTGTGTTTTTTGTTTTGGGGGGG-3′. PCR2 was produced using 5′ primer (J), 5′-AAACACAGAGAGAGCGCTGGGAAAGACCAGAGAT-3′ and the 3′-primer (B). The underlined complementary sequences in I and J primers represent mutated cyclization element (mutCYC). p190-24 plasmid was used as the template for PCR. The two products, PCR1 and PCR2, produced using the primer sets A/I and J/B were purified, mixed, and used for a third PCR in the presence of the primer set A/B. This final PCR product was purified and used for in vitro transcription to generate the 3′-UTR/mutCYC RNA. The RNA templates used in the in vitro RdRP assays are shown in Fig. 1. To synthesize RNA templates containing 3′-terminal 373 nt (3′-UTR373nt) or the subgenomic RNA templates, the plasmid constructs, p190.24 (56Mohan P.M. Padmanabhan R. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and pSY-2, respectively, were linearized with XbaI. The supercoiled plasmids were used as templates for PCR. The PCR products or the XbaI-linearized plasmids were used in the in vitro transcription reaction catalyzed by either SP6 (for the 3′-UTR373nt RNA) or T7 RNA polymerase (for subgenomic RNAs) using conditions supplied by the manufacturer (Promega). Briefly, the in vitro transcription reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 3 h in reaction mixtures (100 μl) containing the 1× buffer (40 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 6 mm MgCl2, 2 mmspermidine, 10 mm NaCl), 5 μg of the DNA templates, a mixture of four rNTPs (0.5 mm each), 100 units of RNasin, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 units of T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase. Then the reaction mixtures were digested with 5 units of RNase-free DNase I (Promega) at 37 °C for 20 min to remove the DNA templates. The RNA transcripts were extracted with phenol at pH 4.5 and precipitated with ethanol. The quality of RNA products was analyzed electrophoretically and quantified spectrophotometically. Because of the 26 nt from the vector sequence at the 5′-end, the 3′-UTR373nt RNA is actually 399 nt in length but is referred to in this study as 3′-UTR373nt. Nonviral exogenous RNAs were prepared by linearizing three different vector plasmids (pSP64, pSP70, and pTM1) with six different restriction enzymes. RNAs were prepared by in vitro transcription and purified as described above. The in vitro RdRP assay was performed in 50-μl reaction mixtures containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 3 mm magnesium acetate, 6 μm zinc acetate, 25 mm potassium acetate, 60 units of RNase inhibitor, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm each ATP, GTP, and UTP, and 10 μm of CTP mixed with 10 μCi of [α-32P]CTP (800 Ci/mmol), 0.1 mg/ml actinomycin D, 10 μg of cytoplasmic extract from infected cells, and 5 μg of an exogenous RNA template. As a control, a parallel reaction mixture containing all the components except the cytoplasmic extract from the uninfected C6/36 cell lysate (10 μg) was included. Controls in which cytoplasmic extracts from infected or uninfected cells but without any exogenous RNA were also included. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 1.5 h. To carry out the kinetics of RdRP reaction, seven separate RdRP reactions that included DEN2-infected cytoplasmic extracts and the subgenomic RNA template were initiated. At time intervals of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 40 min, reactions were terminated by the addition of EDTA (10 mm). The samples were extracted with phenol, pH 4.5, and precipitated by the addition of 0.1 volume of 3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and 2.5 volumes of 100% ethanol in the presence of 5 μg of yeast tRNA (Ambion). The RNA products were analyzed using either polyacrylamide, 7 murea or by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis, followed by autoradiography. The RdRP products separated on PAGE, 7 m urea gels were cut out and eluted in 400 μl of elution buffer (2 mammonium acetate, 1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and 25 μg/ml tRNA) either at 37 °C for overnight or at 65 °C for 4 h. After briefly spinning down gel slices, the supernatants were precipitated overnight with 1 ml of 100% ethanol at −20 °C. The eluted products were treated with or without RNase A (Sigma; 5 ng/μl) in 20 μl of either 2× SSC (300 mm NaCl and 30 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.2) or 0.1× SSC (15 mm NaCl and 1.5 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.2) at 37 °C for 30 min. The reactions were stopped by adding 30 μl of TES stop buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm EDTA, and 0.2% SDS), followed by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation in the presence of 5 μg of yeast tRNA. The RNase A-treated samples were analyzed on formaldehyde agarose gel, followed by autoradiography. In vitro transcribed RNAs were dissolved in 200 μl of 50 mm NaOAc, pH 5.0. 50 μl of 0.1 mNaIO4 (20 mm) was added and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Lysine (60 mm) was added to saturate the excess periodate and further incubated for 3 h at room temperature. The reactions were phenol extracted and precipitated with ethanol. The pellets were washed with 70% EtOH and dissolved in water and subsequently desalted with Bio-Gel P gel column (Bio-Rad). The periodate-treated RNAs were quantified spectrophotometrically and visualized on PAGE, 7 m urea gel by acridine orange. Previous studies showed that flavivirus RdRP activity was tightly associated with intracellular membranes in the cytoplasmic fractions of flavivirus-infected mammalian (monkey kidney cell line (Vero), or baby hamster kidney cell line (BHK-21)) cells (37Chu P.W.

The earlier studies examined the incorporation of labeled nucleotides into the three RNA species that were synthesized from endogenous viral RNA templates. We sought to develop an in vitro RdRP assay that could utilize exogenous RNA templates that contain either 3′- or 5′-untranslated regions or both to determine the sequence requirements for RNA synthesis and to characterize the proteins that interact with these elements. We chose to use an established Aedes albopictus (C6/36) cell line for preparation of cytoplasmic extracts from DEN2-infected cells (see “Experimental Procedures”) because the viral titers are significantly higher in C6/36 cells than in vertebrate cells (64Mussgay M. Enzmann P.J. Horzinek M.C. Weiland E. Prog. Med. Virol. 1975; 19: 257-323PubMed Google Scholar). We constructed cDNA cl"
https://openalex.org/W1577831872,"Among the different base excision repair pathways known, the long patch base excision repair of apurinic/apyrimidinic sites is an important mechanism that requires proliferating cell nuclear antigen. We have reconstituted this pathway using purified human proteins. Our data indicated that efficient repair is dependent on six components including AP endonuclease, replication factor C, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, DNA polymerases δ or e, flap endonuclease 1, and DNA ligase I. Fine mapping of the nucleotide replacement events showed that repair patches extended up to a maximum of 10 nucleotides 3′ to the lesion. However, almost 70% of the repair synthesis was confined to 2–4-nucleotide patches and DNA ligase I appeared to be responsible for limiting the repair patch length. Moreover, both proliferating cell nuclear antigen and flap endonuclease 1 are required for the production and ligation of long patch repair intermediates suggesting an important role of this complex in both excision and resynthesis steps."

In higher eukaryotes, there are two alternative pathways for base excision repair: a DNA polymerase β-dependent pathway and a proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-dependent pathway. Here we have reconstituted PCNA-dependent repair of AP sites with six purified human proteins: AP endonuclease, replication factor C, PCNA, flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1), DNA polymerase δ, and DNA ligase I. The length of nucleotides replaced during the repair reaction (patch size) was predominantly two nucleotides, although longer patches of up to seven nucleotides could be detected. Neither replication protein A nor Ku70/80 enhanced the repair activity in this system.

In this process, the damaged bases are recognized and removed by specific DNA-N-glycosylases, producing apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP)1 sites as common intermediates. AP sites are also generated by spontaneous depurination/depyrimidination and by the action of many different DNA damaging agents. AP sites are one of the most abundant DNA lesions in living cells. Base excision repair further processes AP sites to complete repair. The primary mechanism for AP site repair includes the following reactions: 1) incision of the AP site to generate a nick with 3′-OH and 5′-deoxyribose phosphate (dRP) termini; 2) DNA synthesis at the incised site; 3) excision of the dRP group from the 5′ terminus; and 4) DNA ligation. Recent studies of in vitro repair systems derived from higher eukaryotes demonstrated that repair of AP sites could proceed by two alternative pathways: a DNA polymerase β (pol β)-dependent pathway and a proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-dependent pathway (1Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6187-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 2Frosina G. Fortini P. Rossi O. Carrozzino F. Raspaglio G. Cox L.S. Lane D.P. Abbondandolo A. Dogliotti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9573-9578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The pol β-dependent pathway requires three purified factors: AP endonuclease, pol β, and DNA ligase (3Srivastava D.K. Vande Berg B.J. Prasad R. Molina J.T. Beard W.A. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21203-21209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). To repair AP sites in this pathway, pol β catalyzes two reactions: DNA synthesis by a DNA polymerase activity and excision of the 5′-dRP group by a dRP lyase activity (4Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Thus, the pol β-dependent pathway can efficiently repair unmodified natural AP sites, but cannot repair modified AP sites which are refractory to β-elimination catalyzed by pol β/dRP lyase. To permit repair of the modified AP sites, the flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) removes the dRP group and its 3′-adjacent nucleotide(s) by hydrolysis (5Klungland A. Lindahl T.

Finally, DNA ligase (either ligase I or the ligase IIIα-XRCC1 complex in higher eukaryotes) seals the phosphodiester backbone to complete the repair reaction (3Srivastava D.K. Vande Berg B.J.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7557-7566Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Involvement of these enzymes in base excision repair in vivois supported by studies with mutant mammalian cell lines. Pol β-deficient cells are hypersensitive to various alkylating agents, suggesting that the pol β-dependent pathway plays a major role in the repair of alkylated bases (9Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kuhn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Similarly, cell lines deficient in either DNA ligase I or DNA ligase III activity are also hypersensitive to DNA alkylating agents (see Ref. 10Tomkinson A. Hickson I.D. Base Excision Repair of DNA Damage. Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX1997: 137-150Google Scholar for review). These observations indicate that DNA ligase I and DNA ligase III are not functionally redundant and presumably participate in different pathways that repair DNA lesions caused by alkylating agents. The PCNA-dependent base excision repair system is an alternative to the pol β-dependent pathway. Immunocytological studies have demonstrated the formation of tight complexes of PCNA in nuclei following ionizing radiation, suggesting that the damage generated by such a treatment may be repaired at least in part by the PCNA-dependent pathway in vivo(11Miura M. Sasaki T. Takasaki Y. Radiation Res. 1992; 145: 75-80Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 12Stivala L.A. Prosperi E. Rossi R. Bianchi L. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 2569-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Recently, a consensus amino acid sequence for binding to PCNA was found in several proteins involved in base excision repair, such as FEN1, DNA ligase I, and a nuclear form of uracil DNA glycosylase (13Warbrick E. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar,14Warbrick E. Heatherington W. Lane D.P. Glover D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3925-3932Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with the participation of PCNA in base excision repair in vivo. Since PCNA also interacts with both RF-C and pol δ/ε, PCNA may act as a molecular adaptor coordinating the actions of the enzymes in this base excision repair pathway. In order to test this hypothesis, it is a prerequisite to identify protein factors that are essential for the PCNA-dependent base excision repair pathway. An in vitro system for PCNA-dependent AP site repair was originally developed with three purified proteins, AP endonuclease, PCNA, DNA polymerase δ (pol δ), and two protein fractions, BE-1B and BE-2 from Xenopus laevis oocytes (1Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6187-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was demonstrated that a purified protein, FEN1, could replace BE-2 (6Kim K. Biade S. Matsumoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8842-8848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Biochemical properties of the BE-1B fraction suggested that replication factor C (RF-C) and at least one of the DNA ligases may be included in BE-1B. Here we have reconstituted this repair reaction with six purified human proteins: AP endonuclease, RF-C, PCNA, FEN1, pol δ, and DNA ligase I. We have also examined the effects of mutations in FEN1 and DNA ligase I which abolish the ability of these proteins to interact with PCNA on the repair reaction. In the accompanying paper, Pascucci et al.(15Pascucci B. Stucki M. Jónsson Z.O. Dogliotti E. Hübsher U. J. Biol.

Their data are essentially consistent with our results.

Briefly, 10 ng of the DNA substrate were incubated with the indicated proteins at 25 °C. After the reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS and EDTA, the DNA substrate was recovered and digested with AP endonuclease and either HinfI orPvuII. Subsequently, the samples were electrophoresed in 7m urea, 20% polyacrylamide gel (for theHinfI-digested DNA) or in 8 m urea, 6% polyacrylamide gel (for the PvuII-digested DNA). The gel was subjected to scanning with the Fuji BAS1000 PhosphorImaging System and also to autoradiography on x-ray film. The repair reactions with the 5′-labeled DNA substrate were carried out as described above except that 40 μm each of the four α-thio-dNTPs (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) replaced the four dNTPs. DNA polymerase can incorporate only the Sp form of the two diastereomers of α-thio-dNTP (24Eckstein F. Gish G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 97-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). After recovery from the repair reaction, the DNA substrates were digested with HaeIII, PstI, and AP endonuclease for several hours followed by 1 h digestion with 4 units ofEscherichia coli exonuclease III (New England Biolabs). Following digestion, the samples were electrophoresed in 7m urea, 20% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was subjected to scanning with the Fuji BAS1000 PhosphorImaging System and also to autoradiography on x-ray film. In experiments comparing mutant and wild-type proteins of FEN1 or DNA ligase I, the DNA samples were digested with HaeIII, PstI, and AP endonuclease, but not with exonuclease III, and were resolved by gel electrophoresis as described above. After autoradiography, repaired products in each lane were recovered as single-stranded DNA fragments from the polyacrylamide gel and annealed to 0.5 μg of pBS− single-stranded DNA. Subsequently, the samples were digested with exonuclease III and analyzed by gel electrophoresis as described above. To investigate PCNA-dependent repair, we used circular DNA substrates which are preferable over linear DNA substrates for in vitro PCNA-dependent reactions (25Biade S. Sobol R.W. Wilson S.H. Matsumoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 898-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The circular DNA substrates contained a synthetic AP site analog, 3-hydroxy-2-hydroxymethyltetrahydrofuran, at a defined position (Fig.1). This type of substrate can be efficiently repaired by the PCNA-dependent pathway but is refractory to repair by the pol β-dependent short patch pathway (1Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6187-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). To reconstitute the repair reaction with purified proteins, we employed human AP endonuclease, PCNA, pol δ, and FEN1, which were previously shown to be involved in the PCNA-dependent pathway reconstituted with X. laevis proteins (1Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6187-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The BE-1B fraction was also replaced with human RF-C and DNA ligase I. As shown in Fig. 2, these six human proteins together were able to repair the synthetic AP site (lanes 8 and 15). When any one of these proteins was omitted from the reaction, the AP site was not successfully repaired, and various intermediate products accumulated. The repair reaction catalyzed with the six purified proteins was examined as a function of time. Under the conditions used in this experiment, the repair reaction continued at a relatively linear rate for at least 2 h (data not shown). To examine intermediate products resulting from repair synthesis, we used a 5′-labeled DNA substrate (Fig. 2,lanes 1–8). With this substrate, repair synthesis was detected as elongation of the 5′-fragment incised at the AP site. Such products appeared when AP endonuclease, RF-C, PCNA, and pol δ were incubated together (lanes 6 and 7). Because of the circular nature of the DNA substrates, we assume that RF-C is required to load the clamp protein, PCNA, onto DNA. FEN1 was not essential for incorporation of one or two nucleotides (lane 6). However, the addition of FEN1 in the absence of DNA ligase I resulted in longer tracts of DNA synthesis (lane 7). This indicates that pol δ itself does not actively displace a downstream strand in the DNA synthesis from the incised AP site, but that it always pauses after a 1- or 2-nucleotide extension. We also observed a faint band resulting from 1-nucleotide incorporation in the absence of RF-C or PCNA, although this PCNA-independent DNA synthesis by pol δ did not appear to be efficient enough for AP site repair (lanes 3 and 4). When all six proteins were added to the reaction, we still observed two products of incomplete repair, the incised fragment and the 1-nucleotide elongated fragment, in addition to the repaired product (lane 8). However, these unrepaired fragments decreased after longer incubation (data not shown). Therefore, they are not dead-end products but rather intermediate products during the repair reaction. Since the amount of AP endonuclease added to the reaction was sufficient to incise all the substrates in less than 30 min, the temporary accumulation of the two intermediates suggests that the DNA synthesis which must incorporate at least two nucleotides for complete repair (Ref. 6Kim K. Biade S. Matsumoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8842-8848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar; see below) may be a major rate-limiting step under the condition used in this experiment. Excision of the AP site after incision by AP endonuclease was examined with a 3′-labeled DNA substrate which becomes reduced in length as a result of excision (Fig. 2, lanes 9–16). Although FEN1 is responsible for excision of AP sites in the PCNA-dependent pathway (6Kim K. Biade S. Matsumoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8842-8848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), FEN1 did not efficiently remove the 5′-terminal dRP group in the absence of loaded PCNA (lanes 10 and 11). Significant levels of AP site excision were observed only when AP endonuclease, RF-C, PCNA, and FEN1 were incubated together (lanes 12 and 14). This result is consistent with our previous observation that FEN1 actively removes AP sites in the presence of both PCNA and RF-C-containing fractions (6Kim K. Biade S. Matsumoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8842-8848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The major product of this excision reaction results from removal of the 5′-terminal dRP group and its 3′-adjacent nucleotide together, leaving a 2-nucleotide gap (6Kim K. Biade S. Matsumoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8842-8848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Although it is now apparent that pol δ is not required for AP site excision (lane 12), addition of pol δ to the reaction facilitated longer excision in the absence of DNA ligase I (lane 14). Taking into account that the shortest excision reaction catalyzed by FEN1 generated a gap of 2 nucleotides, the ladder of intermediate products resulting from excision in the absence of DNA ligase I (lane 14) is essentially a mirror image of the ladder generated by DNA synthesis in the reaction with the same proteins (lane 7). This observation suggests that the DNA synthesis and excision steps are coordinated during the repair reaction. We detected faint bands of a fragment which was nearly 1 nucleotide longer than the 3′ fragment incised by AP endonuclease (lanes 10, 11, and 13). This fragment seems to result from abortive ligation by DNA ligase I which has added AMP to the 5′-terminal dRP group but cannot complete the ligation reaction. Replication protein A (RPA; also known as the human single-stranded DNA-binding protein, HSSB) is an essential factor for DNA replication and nucleotide excision repair (21Kenny M. Schlegel U. Furneaux H. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7693-7700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Aboussekhra A. Biggerstaff M. Shivji M.K.K. Vilpo J. Moncollin V. Podust V.N. Protic M. Hubscher U. Egly J.-M. Wood R.D. Cell. 1995; 80: 859-868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar, 27Shivji M.K.K. Podust V.N. Hubscher U. Wood R.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5011-5017Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The involvement of RPA in these DNA transactions appears to be mediated by binding to single-stranded regions of DNA and specific protein-protein interactions (see Ref. 28Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar for review). With the exception of AP endonuclease, all the other protein factors that are employed by the PCNA-dependent pathway of AP site repair are also involved in DNA replication and/or nucleotide excision repair. Therefore, we tested whether RPA had any effect on AP site repair in our reconstituted system. Under these conditions, RPA did not have a significant effect on the repair reaction, although 100 ng of RPA moderately reduced the repair efficiency (data not shown). The Ku70/80 heterodimer is a component of DNA-dependent protein kinase and is involved in nonhomologous recombinational DNA repair and V(D)J recombination (29Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar, 30Rathmell W.K. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7623-7627Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Since the Ku70/80 heterodimer binds not only to double-strand breaks but also single-strand breaks (31Blier P.R. Griffith A.J. Craft J. Hardin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7594-7601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the effect of this protein complex on AP site repair. As with RPA, the Ku70/80 complex did not affect the repair efficiency (data not shown). Thus, we concluded that neither RPA nor Ku70/80 are essential for AP site repair. Since FEN1 does not release a free dRP molecule but an oligonucleotide composed of the dRP group and its 3′-adjacent nucleotide(s), the PCNA-dependent pathway should replace at least two nucleotides during AP site repair. This is in stark contrast to the single nucleotide replacement by the pol β-dependent pathway for repair of unmodified natural AP sites (32Dianov G. Price A. Lindahl T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, repair synthesis catalyzed by pol δ proceeded up to 9 nucleotides in the presence of FEN1 (lane 7), whereas pol δ paused after incorporation of one or 2 nucleotides in the absence of FEN1 (lane 6). To determine directly the length of nucleotides replaced during the repair reaction (patch size), we conducted the repair reaction in the presence of α-thio-dNTPs, and subjected the repaired product to exonuclease III digestion (see Fig. 3 A for schematic procedures). Since the 3′-5′ exonuclease III activity cannot proceed beyond a phosphorothioate group, the size of the repaired DNA remaining after this enzymatic digestion will indicate the 3′ end of the repair patch. We observed that the major product generated by exonuclease III digestion was 2 nucleotides longer than the AP site-incised DNA, although products which were longer by up to 7 nucleotides were detected as minor bands (Fig. 3 B). Therefore, the reaction reconstituted with the six human proteins completed AP site repair predominantly by replacing two nucleotides. PCNA physically interacts with several proteins involved in DNA replication, repair, and cell cycle control. A consensus motif for binding to PCNA, QXX(I/L/M)XX(F/Y)(F/Y), has been found in p21Cip1/Waf1, FEN1, XPG, DNA ligase I, the large subunit of RF-C, a nuclear form of uracil DNA glycosylase, DNA-(cytosine 5) methyltransferase and many other proteins (13Warbrick E. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 14Warbrick E. Heatherington W. Lane D.P. Glover D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3925-3932Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 33Montecucco A. Rossi R. Levin D.S. Gary R. Park M.S. Motycka T.A. Ciarrocchi G. Villa A. Biamonti G. Tomkinson A.E. EMBO J. 1998; 13: 3786-3795Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This motif interacts with one of three hydrophobic pockets on the outer surface of the ring-shaped PCNA homotrimer (34Gulbis J.M. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 297-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Substitution of the adjacent phenylalanine residues with alanine residues within the PCNA-binding motif of FEN1 (F343A/F344A) and DNA ligase I (F8A/F9A) results in the loss of physical interaction with PCNA but does not significantly affect the intrinsic catalytic activities of these proteins (17Gary R. Kim K. Cornelius H.L. Park M.S. Matsumoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4354-4363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar,33Montecucco A. Rossi R. Levin D.S. Gary R.

To examine if the binding to PCNA is essential for the participation of these proteins in the repair reaction, we compared the repair activity of wild-type FEN1 and DNA ligase I to the activity of their mutant forms in which the PCNA binding motif was disrupted. In a previous study, inactivation of the PCNA-binding site of FEN1 (F343A/F344A) slightly reduced AP site repair, but this effect was overcome by the addition of an excess amount of mutant FEN1 (17Gary R. Kim K. Cornelius H.L. Park M.S. Matsumoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4354-4363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). A similar result was observed in the reconstitution experiments in which mutant FEN1 replaced the wild-type protein (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and2). To examine the repair patch size in these reactions, fully repaired products were recovered from the polyacrylamide gel so that unligated intermediates would not interfere with the patch size assay. Since the repair patch produced in the reaction containing the FEN1 mutant was still predominantly 2 nucleotides in length (Fig. 4,lane 6), we concluded that the interaction of FEN1 with PCNA does not determine the size of the repair patch. Finally, we compared the ability of the wild-type DNA ligase I and its mutant, which was deficient in the binding to PCNA, to function in the reconstituted repair reactions (Fig. 5). Ten ng of DNA ligase I supported repair of more than 80% of the AP sites regardless of whether it was the wild-type or the F8A/F9A mutant protein. At lower enzyme concentrations, however, the reactions with the mutant form of DNA ligase I generated a significantly lower amount of the repaired product than the reaction with the wild-type enzyme. More than 80% of the AP sites were still repaired in the presence of 1 ng of the wild-type DNA ligase I protein, whereas the reaction with the same amount of the mutant protein repaired less than 60% of the AP sites. Under these conditions, we detected a long ladder of DNA synthesis intermediates (Fig. 6,lane 3), as observed in the reaction without DNA ligase (Fig. 2, lane 7). In the reaction with 1 ng of the mutant DNA ligase I, the amount of the repaired product with a 2-nucleotide patch was dramatically decreased while the amount of products with a longer patch did not increase significantly (Fig. 6, lane 7). When 10 ng of DNA ligase I was added to the reaction, both wild-type and mutant proteins predominantly generated a 2-nucleotide patch (lanes 6 and 8).Figure 6Patch size of the products repaired with a DNA ligase I mutant deficient in the interaction with PCNA. Repair reactions were conducted as described in the legend to Fig. 3 with α-thio-dNTPs except that 1 ng (lanes 1 and 3) or 10 ng (lanes 2 and 4) of either the DNA ligase I wild-type FEN1 (lanes 1 and 2) or the F8A/F9A mutant (lanes 3 and 4) was employed in addition to the other five factors. After incubation of the repair reactions for 2 h, the DNA samples were digested with PstI andHaeIII, and resolved by electrophoresis in a 7 murea-containing polyacrylamide gel (lanes 1–4). Completely repaired products were recovered from the gel, annealed with pBS− single-stranded DNA and analyzed for their patch size (lanes 5–8) as described in the legend to Fig. 4. The samples loaded inlanes 5–8 were recovered from lanes 1–4, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Thus, inactivation of the PCNA-binding sites of either FEN1 or DNA ligase I does not affect the size of the repair patch in the reconstituted reaction. However, the interactions of both FEN1 and DNA ligase I with PCNA contribute significantly to the efficiency of the reconstituted repair reaction, although they are not essential. Several reports have demonstrated that higher eukaryotes carry out base excision repair by more than one pathway. We have classified base excision repair into a PCNA-dependent pathway and a pol β-dependent pathway (1Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6187-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 4Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). These pathways appear to correspond to the long patch pathway, which is characterized by DNA synthesis of 2–6 nucleotides, and the short patch pathway, which is characterized by a repair patch of one nucleotide, respectively, as described by Frosina et al. (2Frosina G. Fortini P. Rossi O. Carrozzino F. Raspaglio G. Cox L.S. Lane D.P. Abbondandolo A. Dogliotti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9573-9578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). In this study, to reconstruct PCNA-dependent AP site repair, we employed human pol δ to catalyze repair DNA synthesis, since we had previously observed that X. laevis pol δ could efficiently perform the repair synthesis (1Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6187-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that pol δ could not efficiently add even a single nucleotide to the 3′-hydroxyl terminus at the 5′-incised AP site in the absence of either PCNA or RF-C (Fig. 2). This is surprising since PCNA was originally considered to be a processivity factor for pol δ (35Tan C.-K. Castillo C. So A.G. Downey K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12310-12316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Prelich G. Tan C.-K. Kostura M. Mathews M.B. So A.G. Downey K.M. Stillman B. Nature. 1987; 326: 517-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). Templates used in such a standard DNA polymerase assay usually have a long single-stranded region following the 3′ end of a primer. The DNA substrate used in this study, however, was only nicked at the AP site and contained no single-stranded region except for an unpaired nucleotide opposite to the AP site. It is possible that PCNA and RF-C may be required for loading pol δ at the nicked AP site, which otherwise cannot be recognized as a primer end by pol δ alone. Mammalian cells contain a second PCNA-dependent polymerase, DNA polymerase ε (pol ε). Our study does not exclude the potential involvement of pol ε in base excision repair. Indeed, a recent study using a reconstituted system with mammalian cell fractions indicated that a pol ε-containing fraction was able to replace a pol δ-containing fraction for AP site repair (37Stucki M. Pascucci B. Parlanti E. Fortini P. Wilson S.H. Hubscher U. Dogliotti E. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 835-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the accompanying paper, Pascucci et al. (15Pascucci B. Stucki M. Jónsson Z.O. Dogliotti E. Hübsher U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33696-33702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) demonstrated that both pol δ and ε were able to support AP site repair in a reconstituted system with purified protein factors. In budding yeast, repair synthesis of the damage generated by osmium tetroxide treatment (mainly thymine glycols) is predominantly catalyzed by pol ε (POL2) (38Wang Z. Wu X. Friedberg E.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1051-1058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas yeast pol δ (POL3) is required for repair of methylation damage (39Blank A. Kim B. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9047-9051Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the two PCNA-dependent DNA polymerases may be used for base excision repair of different types of damage in yeast. However, the conclusions of studies on base excision pathways in yeast are probably not applicable to mammalian cells, since there are clear differences in the damage-response mechanisms between single-cell organisms and multicellular organisms. For example, pol β-dependent base excision repair plays a major role in the repair of DNA damage caused by alkylating agents in mammalian cells but not in yeast cells. In addition, Klungland and Lindahl (5Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) and Dianov et al.(40Dianov G.L. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13741-13743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) reported that pol β was also involved in the long patch pathway of base excision repair carried out by mammalian cell extracts. Although our results clearly indicate that pol β is not an essential factor for the PCNA-dependent repair pathway, coexistence of pol β may modify the repair reaction. Analysis of in vivo repair will be necessary for a precise assessment of the functional role of each DNA polymerase in mammalian base excision repair. RPA and Ku70/80 did not have any significant effects on the reconstituted system of AP site repair described here. Recently, Stuckiet al. (37Stucki M. Pascucci B. Parlanti E. Fortini P. Wilson S.H. Hubscher U. Dogliotti E. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 835-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) also demonstrated that RPA did not stimulate but rather inhibited in vitro AP site repair catalyzed by PCNA and a fraction containing pol ε, RF-C, and DNA ligase I. On the contrary, DeMott et al. (41DeMott M.S. Zigman S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27492-27498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) reported that the repair reaction of a preincised AP site catalyzed by pol ε, FEN1, and DNA ligase I was stimulated by RPA. In this case, RPA seems to unwind a 5′-incised AP site and its adjacent nucleotides, leading to formation of a stable flap structure either directly or indirectly after strand-displacing DNA synthesis by pol ε. The formation of a stable flap structure can stimulate excision of the AP site and its adjacent nucleotide(s) by FEN1 which has reduced activity at the incised AP site in the absence of PCNA and RF-C (6Kim K. Biade S. Matsumoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8842-8848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In addition, unwinding of the incised AP site may increase the DNA synthesis activity of pol ε. We suspect that these effects of RPA may be negligible if PCNA and RF-C are present in the AP site repair reaction. Nevertheless, our studies do not exclude the involvement of RPA in base excision repair in vivo. In addition, it is reported that the N-terminal region of uracil DNA glycosylase interacts with the C-terminal region of the 34-kDa subunit of RPA (42Nagelhus T.A. Haug T. Singh K.K. Keshav K.F. Skorpen F. Otterlei M. Bharati S. Lindmo T. Benichou S. Benarous R. Krokan H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6561-6566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), suggesting possible modification of uracil DNA repair by RPA. The experiment shown in Fig. 3 demonstrates that a majority of successfully repaired products in the PCNA-dependent reaction results from replacement of two nucleotides. This corresponds to the smallest patch size that is allowed by the excision mechanism of the AP site by FEN1, which generates a gap of at least two nucleotides. The reconstituted system used in this study was able to elongate and excise up to nine nucleotides in the absence of DNA ligase I (Fig. 2,lanes 7 and 14). One possible mechanism which may serve for this limited patch size is that DNA ligase I may suppress the processivity of pol δ or the extensive excision by FEN1, although such activities of DNA ligase I have not been reported yet. Another possibility is that DNA synthesis at the incised AP site by pol δ may be carried out with a significantly low processivity, which allows DNA ligase I to seal the strand after minimal DNA synthesis. The observation of a ladder resulting from 1 to 9-nucleotide elongation rather than the accumulation of the longest product (Fig. 2, lane 7) supports the latter model in which pol δ acts as a low processivity enzyme in this reaction. Experiments with the mutated FEN1 and DNA ligase I proteins that cannot bind to PCNA indicate that the interactions of these proteins with PCNA are not essential for AP site repair if their protein concentrations are relatively high. Although the interaction of FEN1 with PCNA is required for efficient excision of the 5′-incised AP site (17Gary R. Kim K. Cornelius H.L. Park M.S. Matsumoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4354-4363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), FEN1 alone can cleave a stable flap structure in the absence of PCNA (6Kim K. Biade S. Matsumoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8842-8848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Since the major patch size was two nucleotides in the reactions with either wild-type or mutant FEN1, the incorporation of two nucleotides by pol δ seems to be sufficient for the formation of a flap structure that can be processed by FEN1 regardless of the interaction with PCNA. Our results indicate that when the concentration of FEN1 is limited, binding to PCNA increases the efficiency of the repair reaction as previously observed (17Gary R. Kim K. Cornelius H.L. Park M.S. Matsumoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4354-4363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Inactivation of the PCNA-binding site of DNA ligase I also reduced the efficiency of the repair reaction but did not affect repair patch size. This provides the first evidence that the interaction of DNA ligase I with PCNA stimulates DNA ligation. Together these results indicate that the length of the repair patch generated by the PCNA-dependent pathway is determined by the processivity of pol δ at the incised AP site. These findings raise the question of what the function is of the direct interactions of FEN1 and DNA ligase I with PCNA. Our observations that the effect of PCNA binding was apparent only at low enzyme concentrations in the reconstituted reaction suggest that these interactions may be critical for the assembly of these proteins at DNA lesions in vivo. Furthermore, we propose that this recruitment of proteins will result in an efficient coordinated repair reaction that prevents repair intermediates from being processed by aberrant catalytic activities in the nucleus. Through interactions with many protein factors, PCNA appears to serve as a molecular adaptor for DNA replication and repair by encircling DNA and bringing respective proteins together to the site of the reaction. Since one PCNA homotrimer molecule has three binding sites and many proteins have been found to carry the consensus binding motif, it is possible that ternary complexes with different proteins are assembled on the PCNA ring. At the present time, the mechanism by which PCNA selects the appropriate partners at different stages of various cellular activities remains unclear. The reconstituted AP site repair reaction described here provides a defined system for analysis of coordinated molecular interactions in base excision repair. We thank T. Motycka for the purification of DNA ligase I, A. Bellacosa, T. R. Coleman, A. E. McKenna, and H. Yan for critical reading of the manuscript. We are grateful to K. Fien and B.

https://openalex.org/W2031344638,"The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor through which 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and related compounds cause altered gene expression and toxicity. The AHR belongs to an emerging multigene family of transcription factors possessing basic helix loop helix (bHLH) and Per-ARNT-Sim (PAS) domains. Most bHLH-PAS proteins occur as duplicates or “paralog groups” in mammals, but only a single mammalian AHR has been identified. Here we report the cDNA cloning of two distinct AHRs, designated FhAHR1 and FhAHR2, from a single vertebrate species, the teleost Fundulus heteroclitus (Atlantic killifish). Both Fundulus AHR proteins possess bHLH and PAS domains that are closely related to those of the mammalian AHR. FhAHR1 and FhAHR2 are highly divergent (40% overall amino acid identity; 61% identity in the N-terminal half), suggesting that they arose from a gene duplication predating the divergence of mammals and fish. Photoaffinity labeling with 2-azido-3-[125I]iodo-7,8-dibromodibenzo-p-dioxin and velocity sedimentation analysis using 2,3,7,8-[1,6-3H]TCDD showed that both FhAHR1 and FhAHR2 exhibit specific, high-affinity binding of dioxins. Both AHRs also showed specific, TCDD- and ARNT-dependent interactions with a mammalian xenobiotic response element. The two Fundulus AHR genes displayed different tissue-specific patterns of expression; FhAHR1 transcripts were primarily expressed in brain, heart, ovary, and testis, while FhAHR2 transcripts were equally abundant in many tissues. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that Fundulus AHR1 is an ortholog of mammalian AHRs, while AHR2 forms in Fundulus and other fish are paralogous to Fundulus AHR1 and the mammalian AHRs and thus represent a novel vertebrate subfamily of ligand-binding AHRs. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor through which 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and related compounds cause altered gene expression and toxicity. The AHR belongs to an emerging multigene family of transcription factors possessing basic helix loop helix (bHLH) and Per-ARNT-Sim (PAS) domains. Most bHLH-PAS proteins occur as duplicates or “paralog groups” in mammals, but only a single mammalian AHR has been identified. Here we report the cDNA cloning of two distinct AHRs, designated FhAHR1 and FhAHR2, from a single vertebrate species, the teleost Fundulus heteroclitus (Atlantic killifish). Both Fundulus AHR proteins possess bHLH and PAS domains that are closely related to those of the mammalian AHR. FhAHR1 and FhAHR2 are highly divergent (40% overall amino acid identity; 61% identity in the N-terminal half), suggesting that they arose from a gene duplication predating the divergence of mammals and fish. Photoaffinity labeling with 2-azido-3-[125I]iodo-7,8-dibromodibenzo-p-dioxin and velocity sedimentation analysis using 2,3,7,8-[1,6-3H]TCDD showed that both FhAHR1 and FhAHR2 exhibit specific, high-affinity binding of dioxins. Both AHRs also showed specific, TCDD- and ARNT-dependent interactions with a mammalian xenobiotic response element. The two Fundulus AHR genes displayed different tissue-specific patterns of expression; FhAHR1 transcripts were primarily expressed in brain, heart, ovary, and testis, while FhAHR2 transcripts were equally abundant in many tissues. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that Fundulus AHR1 is an ortholog of mammalian AHRs, while AHR2 forms in Fundulus and other fish are paralogous to Fundulus AHR1 and the mammalian AHRs and thus represent a novel vertebrate subfamily of ligand-binding AHRs.

The AHR and its dimerization partner ARNT (AHR nuclear translocator) belong to an emerging family of transcription factors that contain basic helix loop helix (bHLH) and Per-ARNT-Sim (PAS) domains (4Crews S.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 607-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 5Hahn M.E. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. C. 1998; 121: 23-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Many of the mammalian bHLH-PAS family members occur as “paralog groups,” each of which contains duplicated genes with related functions (two to three genes per group, reviewed in Refs. 5Hahn M.E. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. C. 1998; 121: 23-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar and 6Hahn M.E. Karchner S.I. Shapiro M.A. Perera S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13743-13748Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In contrast, a mammalian AHR paralog group like those of other bHLH-PAS proteins has not been reported.Members of the bHLH-PAS family play key roles in development, hypoxia-induced gene expression, the control of circadian rhythmicity, and phototransduction (reviewed in Refs. 4Crews S.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 607-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar and 5Hahn M.E. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. C. 1998; 121: 23-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Unlike most other bHLH-PAS family proteins, the AHR is ligand-activated, although its endogenous ligand is not known. The AHR acts in concert with ARNT to regulate target genes such as cytochrome P450–1A1 (CYP1A1) via binding to consensus xenobiotic responsive enhancer elements (XREs) (3Hankinson O. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 307-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar, 7Whitlock J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 103-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in regulating drug-metabolizing enzymes, possible endogenous functions for the AHR include cell cycle control (8Ma Q. Whitlock J.P. Mol. Cell.

This species has several features that make it a valuable experimental system (15Powers D.A. Science. 1989; 246: 352-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). F. heteroclitus is abundant in both pristine and polluted environments; it is sensitive to dioxins but is capable of developing heritable dioxin resistance after multigenerational exposure (16Prince R. Cooper K.R. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 1995; 14: 579-587Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 17Hahn M.E. Rev. Toxicol. 1998; 2: 395-443Google Scholar, 18Nacci D. Coiro L. Champlin D. Jayaraman S. McKinney R. Gleason T. Munns Jr., W.R. Specker J.L. Cooper K. Mar. Biol. 1999; 134: 9-17Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Unlike some nonmammalian vertebrate models, such as rainbow trout and Xenopus laevis,F. heteroclitus is diploid (19Misof B.Y. Wagner G.P. Mol. Phylog. Evol. 1996; 5: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), facilitating the analysis of gene function and diversity. The developmental biology and population genetics of F. heteroclitus are well known (20Armstrong P.B. Child J.S. Biol. Bull. 1965; 128: 143-168Crossref Google Scholar,21Powers D.A. Ropson I. Brown D.C. van Beneden R. Cashon R. Gonzalez-Villasenor L.A. DiMichele J.A. Am. Zool. 1986; 26: 131-144Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Finally, this species possesses an inducible CYP1A1 (22Morrison H.G. Weil E.J. Karchner S.I. Sogin M.L. Stegeman J.J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. C. 1998; 121: 231-240PubMed Google Scholar), indicating the existence of a functional AHR signaling system.Recently, we reported the presence of AHR (23Hahn M.E. Poland A. Glover E. Stegeman J.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 218-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 24Hahn M.E. Karchner S.I. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and ARNT (25Powell W.H. Karchner S.I. Bright R. Hahn M.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 361: 156-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) homologs in F. heteroclitus. In the course of these studies, we obtained evidence for a second F. heteroclitus AHR gene. Partial sequences of these two FundulusAHRs (PAS domains only) were reported as part of a phylogenetic analysis of the bHLH-PAS family (6Hahn M.E. Karchner S.I. Shapiro M.A. Perera S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13743-13748Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Here we report the full cDNA sequence and functional characterization of both F. heteroclitus AHRs (FhAHR1 and FhAHR2). These AHR paralogs are highly divergent (40% overall amino acid identity; 61% identity in the more conserved N-terminal half), yet both proteins exhibit specific, high affinity binding of dioxins as well as ligand- and ARNT-dependent binding to XRE sequences. Differences in the structural features, ligand-binding specificity, and patterns of expression of FhAHR1 and FhAHR2 suggest distinct functions.The cloning of two distinct AHRs from F. heteroclitus, a teleost fish, provides the first definitive evidence for a vertebrate AHR paralog group. A single AHR form has been cloned from each of several mammalian species (26Burbach K.M. Poland A. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nakayama K. Shimojima T. Itoh S. Kamataki T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 512-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). AHR full-length cDNA sequences have been reported from three other species of fish: tomcod (31Roy N.K. Wirgin I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 344: 373-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), zebrafish (32Tanguay R.L. Abnet C.C. Heideman W. Peterson R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1444: 35-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and trout (33Abnet C.C. Tanguay R.L. Hahn M.E. Heideman W. Peterson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15159-15166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In trout, two AHR forms have been identified. However, these share 97% amino acid identity, indicating that they are derived from a restricted gene duplication related to the recent tetraploid ancestry of salmonid fish. Here we show that F. heteroclitus AHR2 and all of the full-length AHRs reported from other fish species (including both trout AHRs) belong to a distinct AHR2 clade that is paralogous to, and separate from, FhAHR1 and the mammalian AHRs reported to date. The AHR2 clade thus represents a novel subfamily of ligand-binding bHLH-PAS proteins within the vertebrate AHR family.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsA Fundulus λ FixII genomic library was kindly provided by Dr. Dennis Powers and Dr. Joel Sohn (Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific Grove, CA).

The anneal/extend temperature varied (50–60 °C) based on the primers used. In some cases, an additional extension period of 1 min at 72 °C was added to the cycling.Cloning and DNA SequencingThe PCR products were cloned into pCNTR (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc.), pT7Blue(R) (Novagen), or pGEM-T Easy (Promega). Large inserts were digested with various restriction enzymes and subcloned into pBluescript KS− (Stratagene) for sequencing using SequiTherm Excel II long-read cycle sequencing kits (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, WI) and an automated DNA sequencer (LI-COR 4000L). Both strands from multiple clones were sequenced to ensure accuracy.Genomic Library ScreeningThe first Fundulus λ FixII genomic library (Powers) was screened using mouse AHR cDNA fragments of 423 and 700 bp (spanning amino acid residues numbers 26–420) that were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming. Hybridization was in 20% formamide, 6 × SSPE, 5 × Denhardt's, and 0.1% SDS at 37 °C. Filters were washed in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 48 °C. Approximately 3 × 105 plaques were screened. One positive plaque was identified and λ DNA was isolated. Multiple restriction enzymes were used to digest the λ DNA and several fragments were subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene) and sequenced. Approximately 4 × 105 plaques from the secondFundulus genomic library (Crawford) were screened using a 690-bp partial FhAHR2 cDNA fragment (amino acid residues number 117–331) (24Hahn M.E. Karchner S.I. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) as described above. Seven positive plaques were identified and λ DNA was isolated. Restriction fragments from these genomic clones were subcloned and sequenced.cDNA Library Construction and ScreeningF. heteroclitus liver and heart cDNA libraries were constructed using ZAP-cDNA Gigapack II Gold cloning kit (Stratagene). Approximately 1.9 × 106 plaques were screened from each library using 32P-labeled partial FhAHR1 (amino acid residues numbers 252–440) and FhAHR2 (amino acid residues numbers 117–331) cDNAs. Filters were prehybridized in 50% formamide, 6 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS, and 0.05 × blotto at 42 °C. Hybridization was carried out in the same solution at 42 °C overnight. Filters were washed at 65 °C in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS prior to autoradiography. One FhAHR2 positive plaque from the heart cDNA library was isolated and the pBluescript phagemid containing the insert was excised and sequenced.5′-3′ RACEAdaptor-ligated, oligo(dT)-primed, double-stranded liver or ovary cDNA was synthesized using a Marathon cDNA Amplification kit (CLONTECH). Gene specific primers were coupled with adaptor primers in the PCR reactions and the products were cloned and sequenced. For FhAHR1 5′-RACE, primer 1–256R and nested primer 1–239R were used. For FhAHR1 3′-RACE, primer 1–780F and nested primer 1–846F were used. For FhAHR2 3′-RACE, primer 2–410F and nested primer 2–475F were used. In a modified FhAHR1 5′-RACE procedure, cDNA synthesis was performed at a higher temperature to overcome secondary structure in RNA. The first-strand cDNA was synthesized with the Thermoscript RT System (Life Technologies) at 70 °C with a gene-specific primer, 1–317R. Following second-strand synthesis and adaptor ligation, primers 1–109R and nested 1–76R were used for the PCR.Circular RACE (cRACE)Liver cDNA was synthesized with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Stratagene) primed with a 5′-phosphorylated oligonucleotide, 2–191R (37Maruyama I.N. Rakow T.L. Maruyama H.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3796-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The single-stranded cDNA was circularized by T4 RNA ligase. The circular cDNA was amplified with the primer pair 2–134F/2–131R and re-amplified with nested primers 2–151F/2–119R.Other MethodsSequence AnalysisAHR amino acid sequences were aligned using ClustalW, version 1.7 (38Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J.

The PCR product was digested with NdeI and XhoI (primer sites) and cloned into the same sites in pET15b vector (Novagen).pSPFhAHR118–942A 590-bpHindIII/EcoRI fragment containing residues numbers 18–207 was excised from a 737-bp RT-PCR product (1kz/1–256R primers). The upstream primer (1kz) contained an initiation methionine in the context of a Kozak consensus sequence (40Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4151) Google Scholar), resulting in a change in one amino acid residue (T18V). A 2345-bpEcoRI/XhoI fragment (residues numbers 208–942 and 3′-UTR) was excised from the pETFhAHR122–942construct. These fragments containing residues 18–207 and 208–942/3′-UTR were ligated together into theHindIII/SalI sites of the pSP64poly(A) vector (Promega).pSPFhAHR1A 783-bp fragment of FhAHR1 was amplified with the 1KOZ-H3/1–256R primer pair from cDNA synthesized in the modified FhAHR1 5′-RACE reaction. A 630-bpHindIII/EcoRI fragment encoding residue numbers 1–207 (including a consensus Kozak sequence) was excised from this PCR product and ligated into pSP64poly(A) together with residue numbers 208–942/3′-UTR as described for the pSPFhAHR118–942construct.pDPFhAHR2The M2f/2–1090R primer pair was used to amplify a 3250-bp FhAHR2 cDNA from liver. The Kozak consensus sequence was incorporated into the 5′ primer M2f. The PCR product was digested withXhoI and KpnI (primer sites) and ligated into theSalI/KpnI sites of pDP18 (Ambion, Inc.). Advantage cDNA polymerase mixture (CLONTECH) was used in the PCR reactions to maximize fidelity of amplification. All FhAHR1α and FhAHR2 cDNA constructs were verified by complete sequencing.In Vitro Protein SynthesisTNT Quick Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate Systems (Promega) were used to synthesize unlabeled or 35S-labeled proteins following manufacturer's directions. Five μl of the TNT reactions were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by fluorography and autoradiography. The 35S-labeled proteins were quantified by scintillation counting of excised gel fragments.Photoaffinity LabelingFundulus AHR1 and AHR2 proteins, encoded by pSPFhAHR118–942 and pDPFhAHR2, respectively, were synthesized by in vitro transcription and translation and labeled with 2-azido-3-[125I]iodo-7,8-dibromodibenzo-p-dioxin as described by Dolwick et al. (28Dolwick K.M. Schmidt J.V. Carver L.A. Swanson H.I. Bradfield C.A. Mol.

Okey A.B. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1981; 59: 927-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For each AHR, two identical TNT reactions (100 μl total) were combined, diluted 1:1 with MEEDMG buffer (25 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 20 °C, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 0.02% NaN3, 20 mmNa2MoO4, 10% (v:v) glycerol (23Hahn M.E. Poland A. Glover E. Stegeman J.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 218-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) plus a mixture of protease inhibitors (23Hahn M.E. Poland A. Glover E. Stegeman J.J. Arch. Biochem.

The [3H]TCDD concentration was verified by sampling each tube for total counts. After incubation, 90 μl from each tube were applied to 10–30% sucrose gradients that were prepared in MEEDMG buffer using the method of Coombs and Watts (42Coombs D.H. Watts N.R.M. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 148: 254-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The gradients were spun for 140 min at 60,000 rpm at 4 °C in a VTi 65.2 rotor, after which 150-μl fractions were counted using a Beckman LS5000TD scintillation counter. Specific binding is defined as the difference between total binding (incubations containing [3H]TCDD) and nonspecific binding (incubations containing [3H]TCDD plus a 200-fold excess of TCDF). [14C]Ovalbumin (3.6 S) and [14C]catalase (11.3 S) were added as internal sedimentation markers; they eluted in fractions ∼3–4 and ∼15–16, respectively, as indicated. Sedimentation coefficients of AHR proteins were determined by the method of Martin and Ames (43Martin R.G. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1372-1379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Electrophoretic Mobility Shift AssayElectrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed essentially as described (25Powell W.H. Karchner S.I. Bright R. Hahn M.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 361: 156-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), using combinations of proteins synthesized in TNT lysates (2.5 μl each) as detailed in the legend to Fig. 7. Following incubation of the proteins for 2 h in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide or 25 nm TCDD in dimethyl sulfoxide, 1 μg of poly[d(I·C)] (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added, NaCl concentration adjusted to 100 mm, and reactions incubated an additional 15 min with or without 100 ng of unlabeled mouse XRE probe or mutated XRE probe (mutated core sequence is 5′-TTGCTTG-3′; mutated base underlined). Finally, 1 ng of32P-end labeled mouse XRE probe (mouse DRE3 (44Denison M.S. Fisher J.M. Whitlock J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) approximately 105 cpm) was added and the reactions incubated for 15 min more. Samples were electrophoresed on 4% polyacrylamide (29:1 acrylamide:bis) gels in 0.5 × TBE (45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mmEDTA). The dried gel was subjected to autoradiography.Prior to use in the DNA binding assay, unprogrammed and ARNT-containing TNT lysates were extracted once with a quantity of dextran-coated charcoal equal to the mass of total protein in the sample. BecauseFundulus AHR proteins are inactivated by charcoal treatment, 2S. Karchner, W. Powell, and M. Hahn, unpublished data. TNT lysates were extracted once with dextran-coated charcoal prior to AHR synthesis (0.1 mg/mg protein). Charcoal treatments reduced sequence-specific, constitutive background XRE binding.Tissue-specific ExpressionPoly(A)+ RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed with random primers (Gene-Amp RNA-PCR kit, Perkin-Elmer) and an equal aliquot of cDNA was used in each of three PCR reactions with AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). The primer pairs used were 1F/1Ra, 2F/2Ra, and actin F/actin R for FhAHR1, FhAHR2, and β-actin, respectively. The primer pairs for FhAHR1 and FhAHR2 were designed to overlap exon-exon junctions, thereby avoiding amplification of any contaminating genomic DNA. All three sets of primers were designed to amplify similar length fragments (372, 346, and 349 bp for FhAHR1, FhAHR2, and β-actin, respectively) to minimize differences in the efficiency of amplification. The linear range for the PCR was determined by varying the number of cycles from 20 to 35 with 3-cycle increments and using 2, 4, 6, and 8 μl of template cDNA (data not shown). Five μl of template cDNA and 28 cycles were chosen as the amplification parameters. The cycling conditions were: 95 °C/10 min (94 °C/15 s, 60 °C/30 s) for 28 cycles; 72 °C/7 min. Under these conditions, the amount of PCR products amplified from gonad cDNA was linearly related to cycle number and amount of template. Ten-μl aliquots of each reaction (volume verified to be in the linear range for imaging) were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis and subsequent ethidium bromide staining. The gels were photographed using a Kodak DCS 200 digital camera and Adobe Photoshop software. The integrated density of each amplified fragment was determined from the digital image by NIH Image software, version 1.60.The relative abundance of FhAHR1α and FhAHR1β transcripts in different tissues was assessed via semi-quantitative RT-PCR as described above, except that cDNA synthesis was primed with oligo(dT). The upstream primers (1S-888F for α and 1L-888F for β) spanned the splice junction at which the sequences diverge. The downstream primers (1S-1015R for α and 1L-960R for β) hybridized to the 3′-UTR in each transcript. The amplified fragments were 379 and 216 bp for FhAHR1α and FhAHR1β, respectively.DISCUSSIONWe describe here the presence of two highly divergent forms of AHR in a single vertebrate species, the teleost F. heteroclitus.

https://openalex.org/W2153374859,"Hypoxia is a common environmental stress that regulates gene expression and cell function. A number of hypoxia-regulated transcription factors have been identified and have been shown to play critical roles in mediating cellular responses to hypoxia. One of these is the endothelial PAS-domain protein 1 (EPAS1/HIF2-α/HLF/HRF). This protein is 48% homologous to hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α (HIF1-α). To date, virtually nothing is known about the signaling pathways that lead to either EPAS1 or HIF1-α activation. Here we show that EPAS1 is phosphorylated when PC12 cells are exposed to hypoxia and that p42/p44 MAPK is a critical mediator of EPAS1 activation. Pretreatment of PC12 cells with the MEK inhibitor, PD98059, completely blocked hypoxia-inducedtrans-activation of a hypoxia response element (HRE) reporter gene by transfected EPAS1. Likewise, expression of a constitutively active MEK1 mimicked the effects of hypoxia on HRE reporter gene expression. However, pretreatment with PD98059 had no effect on EPAS1 phosphorylation during hypoxia, suggesting that MAPK targets other proteins that are critical for thetrans-activation of EPAS1. We further show that hypoxia-induced trans-activation of EPAS1 is independent of Ras. Finally, pretreatment with calmodulin antagonists nearly completely blocked both the hypoxia-induced phosphorylation of MAPK and the EPAS1 trans-activation of HRE-Luc. These results demonstrate that the MAPK pathway is a critical mediator of EPAS1 activation and that activation of MAPK and EPAS1 occurs through a calmodulin-sensitive pathway and not through the GTPase, Ras.

Recently, endothelial PAS-domain protein 1 (EPAS1, also known as HIF2-α, HLF, and HRF) was identified as a hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (8Tian H. McKnight S.L. Russell D.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar, 9Ema M. Taya S. Yokotani N. Sogawa K. Matsuda Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Russell D.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). EPAS1 protein levels, like HIF1-α levels, are relatively low under basal conditions and accumulate upon exposure of cells to hypoxia (11Wiesner M.S. Turley H. Allen W.E. William C. Eckardt K.-U. Talks K.L. Wood S.M. Gatter K.C. Harris A.L. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Maxwell P.H. Blood. 1998; 92: 2260-2268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These factors then translocate to the nucleus and trans-activate target genes containing the sequence 5′-GCCCTACGTGCTGTCTCA-3′, which is commonly referred to as the hypoxia response element (HRE) (8Tian H. McKnight S.L. Russell D.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar, 12Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2209) Google Scholar). EPAS1 is expressed in many tissues and is particularly abundant in the type I oxygen-sensing cells of the carotid body (13Tian H. Hammer R.E. Matsumoto A.M. Russell D.W. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3320-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Type I cells act as the primary O2 sensors in mammals and are responsible for matching changes in arterial pO2 with appropriate changes in respiration (14Purves M.J. J. Physiol (Lond.). 1966; 185: 60-77Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has used PC12 cells as a model system to study the biophysical and molecular properties of oxygen-sensing cells (15Millhorn D.E. Conforti L. Beitner-Johnson D. Zhu W. Raymond R. Filisko T. Kobayashi S. Peng M. Genter M.B. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 410: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). There are a number of phenotypic similarities between type I and PC12 cells, including the presence of O2-sensitive K+ channels, which are inhibited by hypoxia (16Lopez-Barneo J. Lopez-Lopez J.R. Urena J. Gonzalez C. Science. 1988; 241: 580-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 17Conforti L. Millhorn D.E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 502: 293-305Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In addition, both PC12 cells and type I cells respond to hypoxia with an increase in tyrosine hydroxylase gene expression (18Czyzk-Krzeska M.F. Bayliss D.A. Lawson E.E. Millhorn D.E. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 1538-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 19Czyzk-Krzeska M.F. Furnari B.A. Lawson E.E. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 760-764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, both cell types depolarize and secrete the neurotransmitter dopamine in response to hypoxia (20Krammer E.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2507-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 21Kumar G.K. Overholt J.L. Bright G.R. Hui K.Y. Lu H. Gratzl M. Prabhakar N.R. Am. J.

We have therefore utilized PC12 cells to study the regulation of EPAS1. The specific signaling pathways that are involved in HIF1-α and EPAS1 activation are almost completely unknown. In our previous studies, we measured the effects of hypoxia on the mitogen and stress-activated protein kinase pathways (MAPKs and SAPKs) (23Conrad P.W. Rust R.T. Han J. Millhorn D.E. Beitner-Johnson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23570-23576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We found that moderate hypoxia (5% O2) activates p42/p44 MAPK, two closely related protein kinases that can lead to the phosphorylation and activation of a number of transcription factors (24Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that the MAPK pathway may be important for EPAS1 activation during hypoxia. Results from the current study show that the MAPK pathway is critical for EPAS1 activation, as the specific MEK1 inhibitor, PD98059, prevents EPAS1 trans-activation of the HRE. Interestingly, PD98059 had no effect on EPAS1 protein levels, suggesting that the MAPK pathway is involved in theactivation of EPAS1, rather than the accumulationof EPAS1. We also show, for the first time, that EPAS1 itself is phosphorylated during hypoxia. However, EPAS1 is not directly phosphorylated by MAPK, suggesting that MAPK mediates its effects indirectly, possibly by recruiting other proteins critical for EPAS1 trans-activation. Finally, we show that MAPK-activation of EPAS1 during hypoxia occurs via a calmodulin-sensitive pathway and not through a Ras-dependent mechanism. PC12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/Ham's F-12 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), and with penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Prior to experimentation, cells were grown to approximately 85% confluence in 35- or 60-mm tissue culture dishes (Corning), or in 24-well plates for luciferase assays, in an environment of 21% O2, 5% CO2, balanced with N2. Hypoxia was achieved by exposing cells to various levels (10, 5, and 1%) of O2, 5% CO2, balanced with N2 for various times in an O2-regulated incubator (Forma Scientific, Marietta, OH). PD98059 was obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). EPAS1 polyclonal antibody, the HRE-Luc reporter gene, and the EPAS1 cDNA were generous gifts from Dr. Steven L. McKnight (University of Texas Southwestern, Dallas, TX). pFC-MEK1 was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Additional EPAS1 polyclonal antibody was obtained from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO), and similar results were obtained with both antibodies. RasN-17 was a gift from Dr. J. Silvio Gutkind (National Institutes of Health, NIDR, Bethesda, MD). A c-fos-luciferase fusion reporter gene (fos-Luc) was constructed from a c-fos-β-galactosidase fusion gene construct, kindly provided by Dr. Tom Curran (St. Jude's Childrens Research Hospital, Memphis, TN). The β-galactosidase coding region was excised from the fos-lacZ plasmid (26Schilling K. Luk D. Morgan J.I. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5665-5669Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) withNcoI and BamHI and replaced with the luciferase coding region from the pGL3-basic plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI). W13 was obtained from RBI (Natick, MA). Calmidazolium chloride was obtained from Calbiochem. PC12 cells were transfected with the hypoxia response element-luciferase (HRE-Luc) reporter gene using the Transfast transfection reagent according to the manufacturers recommended conditions (Promega). This reporter gene has been described previously (8Tian H. McKnight S.L. Russell D.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar, 12Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2209) Google Scholar). PC12 cells seeded in 24-well plates at 60% confluence were transfected in triplicate with 3 μl of Transfast and 250 ng of HRE-Luc per well. In some experiments, 25–100 ng of EPAS1, pFC-MEK1, or RasN-17 was cotransfected with the HRE-Luc. In each transfection, pcDNA3 vector DNA was added to bring the total amount of DNA to 1 μg of DNA/well. Cells were switched to serum-free medium for 18 h prior to the start of the experiment. The following day (48 h post-transfection), PC12 cells were exposed to normoxia or hypoxia (1% O2) for 6 h. In other experiments, the effect of NGF on a c-fos reporter gene was evaluated. In these experiments, cells were cotransfected with 250 ng of the c-fos-luciferase reporter gene and varying amounts of an N-17 Ras expression plasmid in 24-well plates. After 48 h, cells were incubated with nerve growth factor (50 ng/ml, Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel) for 6 h. To perform luciferase assays, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 200 μl of cell culture lysis reagent (Promega). Cell extracts were sonicated for 1 s with a microultrasonic cell disrupter (Kontes, Vineland, NJ). Twenty μl of cell extracts were then aliquoted into luminometer tubes (Promega). Fifty μl of luciferin substrate (Promega) was added to each tube and samples were analyzed in a luminometer (Turner Designs). We found previously that hypoxia inhibits expression of cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase, Rous sarcoma virus-β-galactosidase, and SV40-β-galactosidase reporter genes. 2D. Beitner-Johnson and D. E. Millhorn, unpublished observations. Therefore, as in previous studies, luciferase activity was normalized to micrograms of protein per well (3Beitner-Johnson D. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19834-19839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Protein samples varied by less than 15% between samples. Western blotting was performed as described previously (3Beitner-Johnson D. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19834-19839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 23Conrad P.W. Rust R.T. Han J. Millhorn D.E. Beitner-Johnson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23570-23576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). For phospho-MAPK blots, membranes were immunolabeled with antibodies recognizing phospho-Tyr204MAP kinase (1:1000, New England Biolabs). EPAS1 protein expression was assayed using a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against amino acids 1–10 of the EPAS1 protein at a dilution of 1:1000. Experiments were performed essentially as described by Jewell-Motz et al.(27Jewell-Motz E.A. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18082-18087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, PC12 cells plated onto 100-mm dishes were washed twice with phosphate-free DMEM and then incubated at 37 °C in phosphate-free DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 30 min. Phosphate-free medium (5 ml/dish) containing 1 mCi/ml of [32P]orthophosphate and either Me2SO or PD98059 (50 μm) was added to the cells. After preincubation for 1.5 h, cells were exposed to normoxia or hypoxia (1% O2, 6 h). Cells were harvested by washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraping in 1 ml of a lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm sodium vanadate, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. Whole cell lysates were precleared with 5 μl of rabbit IgG (Sigma) and 50 μl of a 10% (w/v) suspension of protein A-Sepharose beads. EPAS1 was immunoprecipitated using 10 μg of an EPAS1 polyclonal antibody (Novus Biologicals) followed by the addition of 50 μl of a 10% (w/v) suspension of protein A-Sepharose beads. The reaction slurry was allowed to rock at 4 °C for 2 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and then subjected to 7.5% PAGE analysis. The gel was dried and analyzed using a phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). As a first step toward characterizing the regulation of EPAS1 in PC12 cells, we evaluated EPAS1 protein levels following exposure to hypoxia. Fig. 1 A shows that exposure to hypoxia (1% O2) for 6 h resulted in a 12-fold increase in EPAS1 protein levels. It has been established previously that EPAS1 can trans-activate an HRE-Luc reporter gene (8Tian H. McKnight S.L. Russell D.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). We found that titrating the level of hypoxia from 21% O2 to 1% O2 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in HRE-luciferase activity (Fig.1 B). We have shown recently that hypoxia specifically regulates certain members of the SAPK and MAPK family (23Conrad P.W. Rust R.T. Han J. Millhorn D.E. Beitner-Johnson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23570-23576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We reported that moderate hypoxia (5% O2) induced a modest phosphorylation of MAPK. Fig. 2 A shows results obtained when PC12 cells were exposed to more severe hypoxia (1% O2), which caused a pronounced phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAPK. Because the MAPK pathway is known to regulate a number of transcription factors, including c-fos, jun-B, CREB, and Elk-1 (28Hipskind R.A. Buscher D. Nordheim A. Baccarini M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1803-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 29Bernstein L.R. Ferris D.K. Colburn N.H. Sobel M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9401-9404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Xing J. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1996; 273: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the MAPK pathway might be important for EPAS1 activation during hypoxia. To test this hypothesis, PC12 cells were cotransfected with the HRE-Luc reporter gene and a plasmid encoding the human EPAS1 cDNA or the empty expression vector, pcDNA3. Cells were then pretreated with either PD98059 (50 μm) or vehicle and exposed to normoxia or hypoxia (1% O2) for 6 h. As reported by others (8Tian H. McKnight S.L. Russell D.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar) we found that expression of EPAS1 increased HRE-Luc activity under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions (Fig. 2 A). We also found that inhibition of MEK1, by PD98059, completely blocked the effect of hypoxia on both basal and EPAS1-stimulated HRE-Luc activity (Fig. 2 A). These results strongly suggest that the MEK1-MAPK signaling pathway is critical for mediating EPAS1 activation of HRE-dependent gene expression. To test this, we measured the effect of expressing a constitutively active MEK1 (pFC-MEK1) on basal and hypoxia-induced HRE-Luc activity. MEK1 is a dual specificity protein kinase that directly phosphorylates and activates MAPK (24Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 B shows that expression of pFC-MEK1-enhanced basal HRE-Luc activity during both normoxia and hypoxia. However, when coexpressed with EPAS1, pFC-MEK1 caused a much larger increase in the trans-activation of the HRE-Luc (Fig.2 B). The relative increase in HRE-Luc activity in the presence of pFC-MEK1 and EPAS1 was 13-fold higher than cells transfected with EPAS1 and exposed to normoxia (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, transfection with EPAS1 alone, followed by hypoxia, resulted in only a 2-fold increase in HRE-Luc activity (Fig. 2 C). The increase in EPAS1 immunoreactivity induced by hypoxia was accompanied by a shift in the mobility of the EPAS1 protein (see Fig.1, inset), suggesting that EPAS1 itself might be phosphorylated during hypoxia. To test this possibility, PC12 cells were pretreated with either PD98059 or vehicle, then metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. Following normoxic or hypoxic exposure, EPAS1 was immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates, and its phosphorylation state was evaluated by SDS-PAGE and PhosphorImager analysis. Fig.3 A shows that hypoxia does indeed induce phosphorylation of EPAS1. However, EPAS1 phosphorylation was not blocked by PD98059, in contrast to the effects of hypoxia ontrans-activation of the HRE-Luc reporter gene by EPAS1. We also tested whether MAPK was involved in the induction of EPAS1 immunoreactivity by hypoxia. In these experiments, PC12 cells were pretreated with PD90859 or vehicle prior to exposure to hypoxia. Whole cell lysates were then immunoblotted for EPAS1. Fig. 3 Bshows that, while hypoxia induced a 13-fold increase in EPAS1 protein levels, inhibition of MEK1 with PD98059 had no effect on the hypoxia-induced accumulation of EPAS1. Ras is an upstream activator of MAPK (24Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar, 31Cobb M.H. Hepler J.E. Cheng M. Robbins D. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 261-268PubMed Google Scholar). In order to test whether Ras was involved in the EPAS1 trans-activation of the HRE-Luc, PC12 cells were cotransfected with the EPAS1 expression plasmid, the HRE-Luc plasmid, and increasing amounts of a dominant-negative Ras expression plasmid, RasN-17. Fig.4 A shows that increasing amounts of RasN-17 had no effect on the EPAS1trans-activation of HRE-Luc. However, coexpression of the same amounts of RasN-17 did block activation of a c-fos-lucreporter gene by nerve growth factor (NGF) in PC12 cells (Fig.4 B). Thus, EPAS1 activation by hypoxia occurs via a Ras-independent mechanism. Hypoxia results in depolarization and calcium influx into PC12 cells during hypoxia (17Conforti L. Millhorn D.E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 502: 293-305Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 32Zhu W.H. Conforti L. Czyzk-Krzeska M.F. Millhorn D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 40: C658-C665Crossref Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, Egea et al. (33Egea J. Espinet C. Comella J.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 75-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 34Egea J. Espinet C. Comella J.X. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2554-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) have shown that depolarization of PC12 cells results in MAPK activation via a calmodulin-dependent mechanism. Thus, we hypothesized that calmodulin could be involved in the activation of MAPK and EPAS1 during hypoxia. Fig.5 A shows that pretreatment of PC12 cells with the calmodulin antagonist, W13 (20 μg/μl), caused a pronounced reduction in hypoxia-induced MAPK phosphorylation. These results are shown quantitatively in Fig. 5 B. We also found that treatment with either W13, or calmidazolium chloride (CMZ, 1 μm), another calmodulin antagonist, inhibited both endogenous HRE activity, as well as the EPAS1trans-activation of the HRE reporter gene (Fig.5 C). Thus, MAPK activation of EPAS1 occurs via a calmodulin-dependent pathway, rather than through the proto-typical mediator, Ras. Regulation of gene expression by hypoxia is mediated by a number of signal transduction pathways (15Millhorn D.E. Conforti L. Beitner-Johnson D. Zhu W. Raymond R. Filisko T. Kobayashi S. Peng M. Genter M.B. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 410: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 35Wenger R.H. Gassman M. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 609-616PubMed Google Scholar). MAPK is known to be critical for the trans-activation of many genes and mediates its effects primarily through the phoshorylation of downstream transcription factors (24Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar, 25Wadman I.A. Hsu H.L. Cobb M.H. Baer R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3713-3716PubMed Google Scholar, 31Cobb M.H. Hepler J.E. Cheng M. Robbins D. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 261-268PubMed Google Scholar). The current study shows, for the first time, that EPAS1 is phosphorylated during hypoxia and that the MAPK pathway is critical for EPAS1 trans-activation during hypoxia in PC12 cells. While our findings suggest that phosphorylation is an important regulatory step for EPAS1 activation, others have also shown that redox-sensitive changes are critical to the formation of the EPAS1 DNA-binding complex (36Ema M. Hirota K. Mimura J. Abe H. Yodoi J. Sogawa K. Poellinger L. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1905-1914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that EPAS1 activation results from the integration of multiple signals and that the importance of specific signals varies in a cell type-specific manner. We found that MAPK is required for EPAS1 trans-activation of the HRE-Luc reporter gene, as this was completely blocked by PD90859, a selective inhibitor of MEK1 (37Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar), and enhanced by constitutively activated MEK1. However, neither hypoxia-induced phosphorylation nor accumulation of EPAS1 protein was inhibited by PD90859. Thus, although MAPK is critical for hypoxic regulation of EPAS1 function, it is not the kinase that phosphorylates EPAS1 during hypoxia. These results suggest that multiple MAPK-dependent and MAPK-independent signals are required for EPAS1 activation. One MAPK-independent signal leads to accumulation of the EPAS1 protein, presumably by inhibition of ubiquitin-proteasome degradation (38Salceda S. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22642-22647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1412) Google Scholar). A second MAPK-independent signal leads to the phosphorylation of EPAS1. Recent evidence by others suggests that multiple signals are involved in regulation of EPAS1 and identifies two domains of EPAS1 that are required for its activation during hypoxia. One of the critical EPAS1 domains is an internal domain that extends from amino acids 450–571 and shares homology with the oxygen-dependent domain of HIF1-α (36Ema M. Hirota K. Mimura J. Abe H. Yodoi J. Sogawa K. Poellinger L. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1905-1914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Huang L.E. Gu L. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar, 40O'Rourke J.F. Tian Y. Ratcliffe P.J. Pugh C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2060-2071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Both the EPAS1 (450–571) and the HIF1-α (oxygen-dependent domain) domains were identified as being critical for the induction of their respective proteins during hypoxia. The second important EPAS1 regulatory domain is a C-terminal activation domain (amino acids 824–876), which is the site of post-translational modification in EPAS1 during hypoxia (36Ema M. Hirota K. Mimura J. Abe H. Yodoi J. Sogawa K. Poellinger L. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1905-1914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore tempting to speculate that phosphorylation of EPAS1 occurs within the C-terminal activation domain of the protein. However, the functional consequences of EPAS1 phosphorylation are unknown and will require further investigation. The mechanism of MAPK-dependent activation of EPAS1 is unknown. The fact that EPAS1 phosphorylation persists in the presence of PD98059 suggests that the MAPK pathway does not directly target EPAS1, but instead targets other protein(s) that are critical for the formation of the EPAS1 DNA-binding complex. Others have shown that CREB-binding protein (CBP) interacts with HIF1-α and EPAS1 and potentiates the activation of these proteins (36Ema M. Hirota K. Mimura J. Abe H. Yodoi J. Sogawa K. Poellinger L. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1905-1914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Arany Z. Huang L.E. Eckner R. Bhattacharya S. Jiang C. Goldberg M.A. Bunn H.F. Livingstone D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12969-12973Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Janknechtet al. (42Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) have shown that C-terminal regions of CBP can be phosphorylated by MAPK in vitro. Furthermore, Liu et al. (43Liu Y. Chrivia J.C. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32400-32407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) showed that MAPK can directly regulate the transcriptional activity of CBP following NGF stimulation in PC12 cells. Thus, CBP might be a target of hypoxia-activated MAPK, which could then recruit EPAS1 to the DNA-binding complex. In addition to CBP, the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene product has been shown recently to be involved in the regulation of HIF1-α and EPAS1 protein levels (44Maxwell P.W. Wiesener M.S. Chang G. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C. Pugh C.W. Maher E.R. Ratcliffe P.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (4152) Google Scholar). Interestingly, pVHL was also shown to be present in the HIF1-α DNA-binding complex (44Maxwell P.W. Wiesener M.S. Chang G. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C. Pugh C.W. Maher E.R. Ratcliffe P.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (4152) Google Scholar). Finally, it has been proposed that several “general transcription factors” are present in the EPAS1 DNA-binding complex (36Ema M. Hirota K. Mimura J. Abe H. Yodoi J. Sogawa K. Poellinger L. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1905-1914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins are also potential targets of MAPK regulation. Thus, it is likely that the MAPK-dependent activation of EPAS1trans-activation involves the recruitment of proteins other than EPAS1 to the DNA-binding complex. The prototypical mechanism of activation of MAPK is via activation of the Ras-Raf-MEK pathway (31Cobb M.H. Hepler J.E. Cheng M. Robbins D. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 261-268PubMed Google Scholar). However, some stimuli, such as endothelin-1 and bacterial lipopolysaccharide, have been shown to activate MAPK in a Ras-independent manner (45Buscher D. Hipskind R.A. Krautwald S. Reimann T. Baccarini M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 46Pracyk J.B. Hegland D.D. Tanaka K. Surgery. 1997; 122: 404-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that hypoxia is similar to these stimuli, as expression of a dominant-negative Ras had no effect on the ability of EPAS1 totrans-activate the HRE-Luc reporter gene. Since EPAS1 activation was Ras-independent, it was of interest to identify the upstream activators that lead to MAPK and EPAS1 activation. Egea et al. (33Egea J. Espinet C. Comella J.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 75-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 34Egea J. Espinet C. Comella J.X. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2554-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) have shown that, following depolarization of PC12 cells, MAPK is activated via a calmodulin-sensitive pathway. Exposure of PC12 cells to hypoxia also causes depolarization and calcium influx, via the inhibition of an oxygen-sensitive K+ channel (17Conforti L. Millhorn D.E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 502: 293-305Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 32Zhu W.H. Conforti L. Czyzk-Krzeska M.F. Millhorn D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 40: C658-C665Crossref Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that calmodulin is critical to the activation of MAPK and EPAS1 during hypoxia. Calmodulin is known to activate a number of proteins, including the calcium/calmodulin-dependent family of protein kinases and the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase, calcineurin (47Maletic-Savatic M. Koothan T. Malinow R. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6814-6821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Klee C.B. Ren H. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13367-13370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Future experiments are aimed at defining the mechanism by which calmodulin activates MAPK under conditions of hypoxia. Finally, while the results of Egeaet al. (33Egea J. Espinet C. Comella J.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 75-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) bear some similarity to our own, their study showed that Ras was critical to the depolarization-induced activation of MAPK and that Ras activation likely resulted from phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor. In contrast to these results, we have found that MAPK activation by hypoxia was Ras-independent, and we were unable to demonstrate phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor by hypoxia. 3T. L. Freeman, unpublished observation. These contrasting results illustrate that there may be important differences between hypoxia-induced depolarization and KCl-induced depolarization. In conclusion, our results show that MAPK and calmodulin are critical mediators of hypoxia-induced signal transduction and transcription factor activation. The importance of this calmodulin-dependent pathway is likely to be unique to PC12 cells and other excitable cells, as nonexcitable cells (HEP3B, HEPG2) do not depolarize when exposed to a hypoxic environment. These results provide the first evidence to define a specific signaling pathway that leads to EPAS1 activation. We show that the MAPK pathway is a critical mediator of EPAS1 activation and that activation of MAPK and EPAS1 occurs through a calmodulin-sensitive pathway, but not through the GTPase, Ras. Further studies are aimed at determining the molecular mechanism by which MAPK regulates EPAS1 function and identifying the endogenous kinase that phosphorylates EPAS1. Such studies will facilitate our understanding of how excitable cells adapt and respond to low oxygen levels. We also show, for the first time, that EPAS1 is phosphorylated during hypoxia and that this phosphorylation is independent of MAPK. We thank Dr. S. L. McKnight for providing unique reagents and for helpful discussion. We also thank Dr. J. W. Pike and Dr. T. Doetschman for their critical comments on the manuscript and G.

Smad4 acts as a cofactor that binds transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) receptor-activated Smad2 and Smad3 generating transcriptional complexes.

Inactivating mutations inAPC 1 (adenomatous polyposis coli) and activating mutations in Ki-ras occur generally early in colon cancer, whereas p53 inactivation occurs generally late, as the adenoma progresses into a carcinoma (1Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1996; 87: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4252) Google Scholar). Another relatively late event is loss of responsiveness to TGF-β (2Filmus J. Kerbel R.S. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1993; 5: 123-129PubMed Google Scholar, 3Fynan T.M. Reiss M. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1993; 4: 493-540PubMed Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, TGF-β is a potent antimitogen in epithelial, including intestinal, cells (4Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (2995) Google Scholar, 5Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Peptide Growth Factors and Their Receptors. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg. Germany1990: 419-472Google Scholar). Loss of TGF-β antiproliferative responses in colon carcinoma cells may compromise the turnover of the colonic epithelium, thus favoring tumor formation. This loss of responsiveness can result from inactivating mutations in TGF-β receptor genes. The most prominent example of this is the loss of TGF-β type II receptor function in the vast majority of colon cancers with microsatellite instability, which are a small subset (around 10%) of all colon cancers (6Markowitz S.

In most other cases, however, loss of TGF-β responsiveness is due to post-receptor defects, the molecular nature of which is only now beginning to emerge.Inactivating mutations in Smad4/DPC4 are the most important of the known TGF-β post-receptor defects in colon cancer. Following the initial identification of Smad4 mutations in half of all pancreatic carcinomas (9Hahn S.A. Schutte M. Hoque A.T. Moskaluk C.A. da Costa L.T. Rozenblum E. Weinstein C.L. Fischer A.

Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Thiagalingam S. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2578-2580PubMed Google Scholar), Smad4 mutations have been reported in more than 30% of invasive metastatic carcinomas and in colon cancer metastases (15Miyaki M. Iijima T. Konishi M. Sakai K. Ishii A. Yasuno M. Hishima T. Koike M. Shitara N. Iwama T. Utsunomiya J. Kuroki T. Mori T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3098-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar).Although the importance of Smad4 as a tumor suppressor gene in colon cancer is becoming increasingly apparent, little is know about how the loss of Smad4 function contributes to tumor progression. Smad4 plays a central role in TGF-β signaling by serving as a common partner of other Smad proteins (16Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massagué J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). TGF-β binding brings together two types of transmembrane serine kinases, the type I and type II receptors. In this complex, the type II receptor phosphorylates and activates the type I receptor, which in turn phosphorylates Smad2 or the highly related protein Smad3. Other TGF-β family members act in a similar fashion. Activin induces phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3, whereas bone morphogenetic proteins induce phosphorylation of the related Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8. Upon phosphorylation, these Smads associate with Smad4 and move into the nucleus where they assemble transcriptional complexes that activate specific sets of genes. Thus, Smad4 is a shared key component of these various signaling pathways.Smad accumulation in the nucleus is a highly regulated process. In addition to the positive effect of the receptor-mediated phosphorylations, which occur at C-terminal sites (17Kretzschmar M. Liu F. Hata A. Doody J. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 18Macias-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar), extracellular signal-regulated kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation at other sites, in response to activators of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, inhibit Smad1, Smad2, and Smad3 accumulation in the nucleus (19Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Massagué J. Nature. 1997; 389: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar, 20Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Timokhina I. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). In mammary epithelial cells transformed by a ras oncogene, this inhibitory effect is sufficiently pronounced to significantly limit the activity of the TGF-β/Smad pathway (20Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Timokhina I. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar).Because Smad4 is a central component of the TGF-β signaling pathway, it has been assumed that the absence of TGF-β antiproliferative responses in Smad4-defective colon carcinoma cells is due to the loss of Smad4 function. However, this hypothesis has not been directly tested, and the possibility that the loss of TGF-β signaling in Smad4-defective cancer cells may be caused by other oncogenic alterations remains open. We have investigated these questions using SW480.7 cells, a colon carcinoma cell line defective in Smad4 function (21Goyette M.C. Cho K. Fasching C.L. Levy D.B. Kinzler K.W. Paraskeva C. Vogelstein B. Stanbridge E.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1387-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 22Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Wu R.-Y. Derynck R.

Here we show that restoration of Smad4 function into SW480.7 cells is necessary but not sufficient to rescue the TGF-β antiproliferative response. We provide evidence that, in addition to Smad4, the rescue of this response requires restoration of Smad3 function, which is suppressed by oncogenic Ras. The surprising presence of two distinct Smad inhibitory hits in the same cell raises the possibility that Smad4 has other roles in the maintenance of colonic epithelial homeostasis besides mediating TGF-β antiproliferative responses.DISCUSSIONInhibition of cell cycle progression, facilitation of differentiation, induction of apoptosis, and regulation of cell adhesion and extracellular matrix production are effects of TGF-β through which this factor is thought to contribute to the maintenance of epithelial tissue homeostasis (4Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (2995) Google Scholar, 5Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Peptide Growth Factors and Their Receptors. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg. Germany1990: 419-472Google Scholar). Loss of these TGF-β responses is often observed in carcinoma cells, including colon cancer cells (2Filmus J. Kerbel R.S. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1993; 5: 123-129PubMed Google Scholar, 3Fynan T.M. Reiss M. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1993; 4: 493-540PubMed Google Scholar). Different lines of evidence point to Smad4 as a tumor suppressor gene in colon cancer; however, the reasons why its loss contributes to tumorigenesis are not yet understood. Specifically, it has not been clear whether loss of TGF-β antiproliferative responses in Smad4-defective colon cancer cells is due to the loss of Smad4 function or to other oncogenic events. There has not been, to our knowledge, reports that restoration of a wild-type Smad4allele in Smad4-defective tumor-derived cell lines rescues TGF-β antiproliferative responses. We have investigated this question using the SW480.7 colon carcinoma cell line, which is defective in Smad4 function (22Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Wu R.-Y. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 23Liu F. Pouponnot C. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). One of the oncogenic defects of this cell line is the loss of one copy of chromosome 18 (21Goyette M.C. Cho K. Fasching C.L. Levy D.B. Kinzler K.W. Paraskeva C. Vogelstein B. Stanbridge E.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1387-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). According to the two-hit model of tumor suppressor gene inactivation (43Knudson Jr., A.G. Hethcote H.W. Brown B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 5116-5220Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), the loss of Smad4 function in these cells could have arisen from an inactivating mutation in the remaining Smad4 allele. Surprisingly, we found that SW480.7 contain a Smad4 allele that encodes for a wild type protein. However, expression of this allele is strongly suppressed, as its mRNA and protein products are present at very low, nearly undetectable, levels. The mechanism responsible for this defective expression is not known at present, but this finding raises the possibility that Smad4 silencing is another mechanism leading to the loss of Smad4 function in colon cancer, a possibility worthy of future investigation.The lack of detectable Smad4 function allowed us to use SW480.7 cells to study the consequences of restoring expression of this gene. It was recently reported that SW480.7 cells stably transfected with Smad4 are not growth-inhibited by TGF-β (44Schwarte-Waldhoff I. Klein S. Blass-Kampmann S. Hintelmann A. Eilert C. Dreschers S. Kalthoff H. Hahn S.A. Schmiegel W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3152-3158Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, if Smad4 is a mediator of antiproliferative responses, its constitutive overexpression in transfected SW480.7 cells could lead to the selection of Smad4-resistant clones due to secondary mutations. To avoid this potential problem, we generated SW480.7 cell lines conditionally expressing a human wild-type Smad4 allele under the control of the ecdysone system. The levels of Smad4 expressed under inducing conditions by the three SW480.7 derivatives used in this study were similar to those of HaCaT keratinocytes, which is a well characterized, TGF-β-responsive cell line (27Reynisdóttir I. Polyak K. Iavarone A. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1831-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar, 28Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1994; 371: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar, 38Mulder K.M. Humphrey L.E. Choi H.G. Childress-Fields K.E. Brattain M.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 145: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 39Datto M.B. Li Y. Panus J.F. Howe D.J. Xiong Y. Wang X.-F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5545-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Assays using the highly responsive TGF-β reporter construct 3TP-Lux demonstrated that Smad4 function had been restored in the Smad4-inducible SW480.7 clones. Surprisingly, however, expression of Smad4 in these cells supported only a weak A3-Luc response to TGF-β. The A3-Luc reporter is based on a TGF-β target gene enhancer element (35Chen X. Rubock M.J. Whitman M. Nature. 1996; 383: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) and is less sensitive to TGF-β than the 3TP-Lux reporter, which is a composite reporter construct empirically assembled to provide high responsiveness to this factor (34Cárcamo J. Zentella A. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1573-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The limited signaling ability of Smad4 in these cells was further demonstrated by their failure to show endogenous antiproliferative gene responses, including down-regulation of c-myc or up-regulation of p21/Cip1, which are typical of TGF-β action in colonic and other epithelial cells (37Alexandrow M.G. Moses H.L. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1452-1457PubMed Google Scholar,39Datto M.B. Li Y. Panus J.F. Howe D.J. Xiong Y. Wang X.-F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5545-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). The absence of these responses in Smad4-expressing SW480.7 cells was accompanied by a lack of growth inhibition.The absence of robust antiproliferative effects and endogenous gene responses to TGF-β in SW480.7 cells induced to express normal levels of Smad4 raises the possibility that other oncogenic alterations present in these cells are limiting Smad4 signaling function. Our evidence indicates that neither the presence of APCmutations nor limitations in TGF-β type II receptor levels contribute to the lack of TGF-β responsiveness in SW480.7. p53, which is inactivated in SW480.7 cells, is not a candidate because it is also inactivated in HaCaT cells, which are highly responsive to TGF-β (27Reynisdóttir I. Polyak K. Iavarone A. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1831-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar,28Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1994; 371: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar, 38Mulder K.M. Humphrey L.E. Choi H.G. Childress-Fields K.E. Brattain M.G. J. Cell.

A. 1995; 92: 5545-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). The TGF-β receptor-regulated Smads, Smad2, and Smad3 are expressed in SW480.7 cells, and their levels do not appear to be rate-limiting because cotransfection of exogenous Smad2 or Smad3 did not very much improve the antiproliferative response in Smad4-transfected SW480.7 cells.Our results identify the hyperactive Ras pathway present in SW480.7 cells as a rate-limiting event for the signaling function of Smad4. SW480.7 cells harbor a Ki-ras-activating mutation (21Goyette M.C. Cho K. Fasching C.L. Levy D.B. Kinzler K.W. Paraskeva C. Vogelstein B. Stanbridge E.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1387-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), which is a frequent event in colon cancer (45Bos J.L. Fearon E.R. Hamilton S.R. Verlaan-de Vries M. van Boom J.H. van der Eb A.J. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1987; 327: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar, 46Forrester K. Almoguera C. Han K. Grizzle W.E. Perucho M. Nature. 1987; 327: 298-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). Ras transformation of intestinal and other epithelial cells inhibits TGF-β antiproliferative effects (2Filmus J. Kerbel R.S. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1993; 5: 123-129PubMed Google Scholar, 47Schwarz L.C. Gingras M.C. Goldberg G. Greenberg A.H. Wright J.A. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 6999-7003PubMed Google Scholar, 48Valverius E.M.

Oncogene. 1989; 4: 19-25PubMed Google Scholar, 50Longstreet M. Miller B. Howe P.H. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1549-1556PubMed Google Scholar). Hyperactivation of the Ras pathway can provide strong stimulation of cyclin-dependent kinases (51Kerkhoff E. Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1457-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), and this alone could serve to oppose the inhibitory effects of TGF-β on these targets. However, we recently showed that Ras signaling can interfere with Smad signal transduction by inhibiting Smad accumulation in the nucleus (20Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Timokhina I. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Nuclear accumulation of Smads in response to TGF-β is less efficient in colon cancer cell lines harboring Ki-ras mutations than in colon cancer cell lines containing wild type Ki-ras (20Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Timokhina I. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). As we show here, SW480.7 cells also have blunted Smad2/3 nuclear accumulation response. Following this lead, we found that a Ras-resistant mutant form of Smad3 lacking inhibitory mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation sites can strongly enhance the ability of Smad4 to rescue the antiproliferative response in SW480.7 cells.In sum, restoration of Smad4 expression and removal of Smad3 and presumably also Smad2 inhibition by Ras are required for restoration of TGF-β antiproliferative responses in SW480.7 cells. These results provide the first evidence that loss of Smad4 function indeed contributes to deprive colon cancer cells of antiproliferative responsiveness to TGF-β. At the same time, our evidence suggests an important contribution of a hyperactive Ras pathway. The coexistence ofSmad4 and Ki-ras mutations is not unique to SW480.7 cells; the high frequency of Smad4 and Ki-ras mutations in metastatic colon cancer (15Miyaki M. Iijima T. Konishi M. Sakai K. Ishii A. Yasuno M. Hishima T. Koike M. Shitara N. Iwama T. Utsunomiya J. Kuroki T. Mori T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3098-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 45Bos J.L. Fearon E.R.

Perucho M. Nature. 1987; 327: 298-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar) and pancreatic cancer (52Rozenblum E. Schutte M. Goggins M. Hahn S.A. Panzer S. Zahurak M. Goodman S.N. Sohn T.A. Hruban R.H. Yeo C.J. Kern S.E. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1731-1734PubMed Google Scholar) predicts the coexistence of both mutations in many such tumors. These findings, then, raise the question: If Smad4 loss and Ras activation can compromise TGF-β signaling, why do both alterations accumulate in the same cell? The answer is unknown at present but may depend on the order in which these mutations occur in a tumor. Ki-ras mutations are generally early events in colon cancer (45Bos J.L. Fearon E.R. Hamilton S.R. Verlaan-de Vries M. van Boom J.H. van der Eb A.J. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1987; 327: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar), whereas Smad4 mutations are generally late events (15Miyaki M. Iijima T. Konishi M. Sakai K. Ishii A. Yasuno M. Hishima T. Koike M. Shitara N. Iwama T. Utsunomiya J. Kuroki T. Mori T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3098-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Ras activation may compromise, without eliminating, TGF-β signaling; a loss of Smad4 function later on may impart a more complete resistance to TGF-β responsiveness. Alternatively, Ras activation may be sufficient to eliminate TGF-β antiproliferative responses but not other responses mediated by Smad4 that constrain tumor invasion and metastasis (44Schwarte-Waldhoff I. Klein S. Blass-Kampmann S. Hintelmann A. Eilert C. Dreschers S. Kalthoff H. Hahn S.A. Schmiegel W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3152-3158Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In this case, loss of Smad4 function would be targeting a specific subset of responses, contributing to the emergence of a more malignant phenotype. The molecular events leading to colon cancer involve the sequential mutation of specific genes that transform a normal colonic epithelium to an adenomatous polyp and, ultimately, to an invasive cancer. Inactivating mutations inAPC 1 (adenomatous polyposis coli) and activating mutations in Ki-ras occur generally early in colon cancer, whereas p53 inactivation occurs generally late, as the adenoma progresses into a carcinoma (1Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1996; 87: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4252) Google Scholar). Another relatively late event is loss of responsiveness to TGF-β (2Filmus J. Kerbel R.S. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1993; 5: 123-129PubMed Google Scholar, 3Fynan T.M. Reiss M. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1993; 4: 493-540PubMed Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, TGF-β is a potent antimitogen in epithelial, including intestinal, cells (4Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (2995) Google Scholar, 5Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Peptide Growth Factors and Their Receptors. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg. Germany1990: 419-472Google Scholar). Loss of TGF-β antiproliferative responses in colon carcinoma cells may compromise the turnover of the colonic epithelium, thus favoring tumor formation. This loss of responsiveness can result from inactivating mutations in TGF-β receptor genes. The most prominent example of this is the loss of TGF-β type II receptor function in the vast majority of colon cancers with microsatellite instability, which are a small subset (around 10%) of all colon cancers (6Markowitz S. Wang J. Myeroff L. Parsons R. Sun L. Lutterbaugh J. Fan R.S. Zborowska E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Brattain M. Wilson J.K.V.

Copeland 3rd, E.M. Ann. Surg. 1998; 227: 781-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In most other cases, however, loss of TGF-β responsiveness is due to post-receptor defects, the molecular nature of which is only now beginning to emerge. Inactivating mutations in Smad4/DPC4 are the most important of the known TGF-β post-receptor defects in colon cancer. Following the initial identification of Smad4 mutations in half of all pancreatic carcinomas (9Hahn S.A. Schutte M. Hoque A.T. Moskaluk C.A. da Costa L.T. Rozenblum E. Weinstein C.L. Fischer A. Yeo C.J. Hruban R.H. Kern S.E. Science. 1996; 271: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (2157) Google Scholar), Smad4 mutations were reported in colon cancer (10Takagi Y. Kohmura H. Futamura M. Kida H.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4221-4224PubMed Google Scholar). In colon cancer, the incidence of Smad4 mutations appears to increase with tumor progression. Although rare as an initiating event (12Howe J.R. Roth S. Ringold J.C. Summers R.W. Jarvinen H.J. Sistonen P. Tomlinson I.P. Houlston R.S. Bevan S. Mitros F.A. Stone E.M. Aaltonen L.A. Science. 1998; 280: 1086-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar) and relatively infrequent (approximately 10% of cases) in colon adenomas and nonmetastatic carcinomas (14Riggins G.J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Thiagalingam S. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2578-2580PubMed Google Scholar), Smad4 mutations have been reported in more than 30% of invasive metastatic carcinomas and in colon cancer metastases (15Miyaki M. Iijima T. Konishi M. Sakai K. Ishii A. Yasuno M. Hishima T. Koike M. Shitara N. Iwama T. Utsunomiya J. Kuroki T. Mori T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3098-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Although the importance of Smad4 as a tumor suppressor gene in colon cancer is becoming increasingly apparent, little is know about how the loss of Smad4 function contributes to tumor progression. Smad4 plays a central role in TGF-β signaling by serving as a common partner of other Smad proteins (16Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massagué J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). TGF-β binding brings together two types of transmembrane serine kinases, the type I and type II receptors. In this complex, the type II receptor phosphorylates and activates the type I receptor, which in turn phosphorylates Smad2 or the highly related protein Smad3. Other TGF-β family members act in a similar fashion. Activin induces phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3, whereas bone morphogenetic proteins induce phosphorylation of the related Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8. Upon phosphorylation, these Smads associate with Smad4 and move into the nucleus where they assemble transcriptional complexes that activate specific sets of genes. Thus, Smad4 is a shared key component of these various signaling pathways. Smad accumulation in the nucleus is a highly regulated process. In addition to the positive effect of the receptor-mediated phosphorylations, which occur at C-terminal sites (17Kretzschmar M. Liu F. Hata A. Doody J. Massagué J.

There is therefore considerable interest in developing novel chemotherapeutic approaches, based on unique aspects of the structure and metabolism of this parasite.T. cruzi develops intracellularly in its vertebrate hosts and is confronted during its life cycle with drastic changes in its microenvironment. Survival through such complex environmental changes requires appropriate reserves of carbon and energy sources, as well as signaling species, such as Ca2+. Recent work has led to the identification of an acidic calcium pool (acidocalcisome) in this organism (1Docampo R. Scott D.A. Vercesi A.E. Moreno S.N.J. Biochem.

However, the precise chemical nature of the phosphorus compound(s) in these vacuoles was not determined. In this work, we used 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to investigate the nature of the acidocalcisomal phosphorus. 31P NMR has been extensively used in the past to study the energy metabolism of several microorganisms, as well as that of living vertebrate tissues (5Hoult D.I.

Biol. 1998; 18: 2309-2323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein was measured using the Bio-Rad Coomassie Blue method. For NMR, T. cruzi epimastigotes (∼2.5 g wet weight) or amastigotes (∼0.5 g wet weight) were washed twice with Buffer A (116 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, and 5.5 mm glucose) and extracted with ice-cold 0.5m HClO4 (2 ml/g of wet weight of cells). After 30 min of incubation on ice, the extracts were centrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min. The supernatants were neutralized by the addition of 0.72 m KOH/0.6 m KHCO3. Precipitated KClO4 was removed by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 5 min, the supernatant separated and pH adjusted to 8.0 with 0.1 m KOH. Samples were divided into two identical portions, 2 mm MgSO4 was added to each, and these were incubated in the absence or presence of inorganic pyrophosphatase (Sigma; final activity, 10 units/ml) at 30 °C, pH 7.4. Methylphosphonate was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm as an internal NMR shift standard, and samples were made 10% (v/v) in D2O to provide a field-frequency lock. For the experiments with pyrophosphatase (see Fig. 4), cells were lightly fixed with a solution of 3.5% formaldehyde in Buffer A for 5 min, washed, resuspended in Buffer A containing 2 mm MgSO4 in the absence (control) or in the presence of 10 units/ml inorganic pyrophosphatase, and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Cells were washed with 0.25m sucrose, resuspended in the same solution, applied to Formvar-coated grids for 10 min, and then blotted dry and observed directly using a Hitachi 600 electron microscope. For conventional electron microscopy (see Fig. 6), cells and fractions were treated exactly as described in Ref. 2Lu H.-G. Zhong L. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. Mol. Cell.

All NMR experiments were carried out at 25 °C. Chemical shifts are reported with respect to external 85% H3PO4 using the convention that high frequency, low field, paramagnetic or deshielded values are positive (IUPAC convention δ-scale). Direct referencing versus both an external standard of 85% H3PO4 (replacement method) and an internal standard of methyl phosphonate (taken to be 22 ppm downfield from 85% H3PO4, at pH 8.0) was used. For Percoll subcellular fractionation, we used a previous method (4Scott D.A. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Zhong L. Lu H.-G. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22151-22158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) except that a fluoride (15 mm)-containing lysis buffer was used. Other experimental details such as protocols for density gradients and enzyme assays were as described previously (3Scott D.A. Docampo R. Dvorak J.A. Shi S. Leapman R. J. Biol.

Pyrophosphate was determined by measuring phosphate released by inorganic pyrophosphatase using perchloric acid extracts from 0.1 g of cells (11Blum J.J. J. Protozool. 1989; 36: 254-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Nucleotides were assayed by separating perchloric acid extracts by HPLC1 using an Isco ternary gradient system fitted with a 0.46 × 25-cm (10 μm) Partisil Sax column (Alltech) (12Docampo R. Gadelha F.R. Moreno S.N.J. Benaim G. Hoffmann M.E. Vercesi A.E. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 1993; 40: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cells (1.2 × 108 epimastigotes/ml) were prelabeled with 5 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate for 3 h in Buffer A (total volume, 60 ml) at 30 °C. At the end of the labeling period, cells were centrifuged and washed twice in 0.25 m sucrose and once in lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 35 mm KCl, 125 mm sucrose, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml DNase, 50 μg/ml RNase, 2 μm leupeptin, 2 μm trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane, 2 μm pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cell pellet was mixed with 1.5 × wet weight silicon carbide and ground with a mortar and pestle until lysis was greater than 90% (generally 40 s). Silicon carbide and unlysed cells were removed by centrifugation twice at 150 ×g for 5 min. The supernatant was first centrifuged at 10,500 × g for 20 min and then at 105,000 ×g for 60 min. Perchloric acid extracts of the fractions were prepared and HPLC fractionation carried out as described above for ATP determination. Some extracts were treated with yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase (10 units/ml) for 30 min at 30 °C prior to application to the column, to identify the pyrophosphate elution peak. T. cruzia mastigote proliferation in L6E9 myoblasts was measured by uracil incorporation or Giemsa staining (13Yan W. Moreno S.N.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1998; 220: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Invasion assays were performed as described (13Yan W. Moreno S.N.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1998; 220: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Female NMRI albino mice (20–25 g of body weight) were infected intraperitoneally with 104trypomastigotes of the Y strain of T. cruzi, and intravenous treatment with pamidronate disodium (Aredia, 10 mg/kg/day) dissolved in sterile phosphate buffer was started 4 days postinfection; pamidronate disodium was given daily for a total of seven doses. Controls received the vehicle. Parasitemia determinations and handling of the experimental animals were carried out as described in Ref. 14Urbina J.A. Payares G. Molina J. Sanoja C. Liendo A. Lazardi K. Piras M.M. Piras R. Perez N. Wincker P. Ryley J.F. Science. 1996; 273: 969-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar. Fig.1 A shows the 303.65 MHz31P NMR spectrum of a perchloric acid extract, at pH 8.0, of the epimastigote forms of T. cruzi, Y strain, grown axenically. The spectrum is dominated by two principal features: a resonance at 3.8 ppm, probably associated with inorganic orthophosphate, and a principal resonance at −4.2 ppm, close to the range of the resonance frequencies of terminal phosphates of nucleotide di- and triphosphates and pyrophosphate; resonances of much lower intensity were also observed in the region of α- (−9 to −13 ppm) and β-phosphates (−15 to −20 ppm) of nucleotides. This spectrum differs markedly from those of most other cell and tissue extracts (5Hoult D.I. Busby S.J.W. Gadian D.G. Radda G.K. Richards R.E. Seeley P.J. Nature. 1974; 252: 285-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar,6Cerdan S. Seelig J. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 19: 43-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 15Murphy E.J.

Acta. 1992; 1135: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), which contain prominent resonances due to the α-, β-, and γ-phosphate groups of nucleotides. In the case of T. cruziepimastigotes, the integrated intensity of the dominant peak at −4.2 ppm was 10–12 times higher than the corresponding area in the α-phosphate region (−9.1 ppm) of nucleotides (six independent experiments), implying that the peak was not of nucleotide origin. The lack of a strong resonance at −22 ppm also rules out the presence of significant amounts of soluble polyphosphates in these extracts (7Sianoudis J. Küsel A.C. Mayer A. Grimme L.H. Leibfritz D. Arch. Microbiol. 1986; 144: 48-54Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 8Martin J.B. Foray M.F. Klein G. Satre M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 931: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Very similar features were found in spectra of perchloric acid extracts of clone Silvio X10/4 epimastigotes or of epimastigotes grown in BHI medium (results not shown) and of the intracellular amastigote forms (Fig. 1 C) obtained from infected L6E9 myoblasts cultured in vitro at 37 °C. Extraction of perchloric acid insoluble material according to published procedures (7Sianoudis J. Küsel A.C. Mayer A. Grimme L.H. Leibfritz D. Arch. Microbiol. 1986; 144: 48-54Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 8Martin J.B. Foray M.F. Klein G. Satre M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 931: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) revealed the presence of short-chain polyphosphates in quantities comparable to that of pyrophosphate (results not shown). The origin of each of the dominant resonances present in the perchloric acid extracts was then further investigated by recording a31P-31P COSY spectrum (Fig.2). This showed that the −4.2 ppm resonance was not correlated with any others in the two-dimensional spectrum and that the less intense resonances at −4.54 and −4.85 ppm were correlated only with resonances in the β-phosphate region (−16.2 and −18.2 ppm), whereas a much smaller resonance at −5.21 ppm had correlations with both α- and β-phosphate resonances (−9.1 and −19.3 ppm). These results imply that the dominant resonance at −4.2 ppm is due to pyrophosphate, whereas those at −4.54, −4.85, and −5.21 ppm can be tentatively assigned to the terminal phosphate groups of triphosphate, tetraphosphate, and the γ-phosphate of nucleoside triphosphates, respectively. The assignment of the −4.2 ppm resonance to pyrophosphate was then substantiated by “spiking” the samples with pure Na2P2O7, which resulted in an increase in intensity of this resonance (not shown). Additional support for these assignments was then also obtained by incubating the perchloric acid extracts with pure yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase. After 60 min of treatment of the extracts of epimastigotes (Fig.1 B) or amastigotes (Fig. 1 D), the resonances at −4.2 ppm were reduced, and there were concomitant stoichiometric increases in the intensity of the resonances at 3.8 ppm assigned to inorganic orthophosphate (Fig. 1, B and D). The presence of pyrophosphate was also confirmed by enzymatic assay using yeast pyrophosphatase. This gave a pyrophosphate concentration of 194.7 ± 25.9 nmol/mg of protein for epimastigotes and 358 ± 17 nmol/mg of protein (n = 3) for amastigotes ofT. cruzi, values that were much higher than the concentrations of ATP in the same extracts (37.6 ± 5.5 and 36.0 ± 1.9 nmol/mg of protein, respectively; n = 3), as assayed by HPLC. Taken together, these results indicate that pyrophosphate is more abundant than ATP in T. cruzi. HPLC analysis of32P-labeled compounds in perchloric acid extracts of cells labeled during a 3-h incubation with [32P]orthophosphate also indicated the presence of a significant inorganic pyrophosphate component (which co-eluted with GTP; Fig.3 A, solid line), identified by comparison with an authentic standard and by its decrease after incubation with inorganic pyrophosphatase (Fig.3 A, dashed line). After this labeling period, most of the labeled phosphorus was detected in nucleotides (ATP, ADP, AMP, GTP, and GDP) and only 2.2 ± 0.2% (n = 4) of the total radioactivity incorporated was detected as pyrophosphate, indicating relatively low metabolic turnover. When subcellular fractions of epimastigotes prelabeled for 3 h with32P were analyzed (Fig. 3, B–D), labeling of pyrophosphate was more noticeable in the supernatant fraction (78% of the total pyrophosphate identified) than in the 10,500 ×g (5.1%) or 105,000 × g (16%) pellets. The amount of radioactivity with an elution time corresponding to [32P]pyrophosphate decreased and that corresponding to [32P]orthophosphate increased significantly after incubation of the extracts from the supernatant and 105,000 ×g pellet fractions with inorganic pyrophosphatase, whereas a smaller decrease was detected in the extract of the 10,500 ×g pellet (Fig. 3, dashed line), suggesting a lower turnover of the compound in this fraction, which contains acidocalcisomes and mitochondria. As a control for breakage of acidocalcisomes during cell lysis, we measured zinc levels in each fraction by using atomic absorption spectroscopy. Zinc was shown previously to be accumulated in the acidocalcisomal matrix, but not elsewhere in T. cruzi epimastigotes (3Scott D.A. Docampo R. Dvorak J.A. Shi S. Leapman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28020-28029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Of a total of 700 μg of zinc detected, 92% was found in the 10,500 ×g pellet fraction, 2% in the 105,000 × gpellet fraction, and 6% in the 105,000 × gsupernatant fraction (whereas the protein distribution was 36, 23, and 41%, respectively, of 80 mg of protein total). This indicated that little of the acidocalcisome matrix was released into the soluble fraction during cell lysis. In previous work (3Scott D.A. Docampo R. Dvorak J.A. Shi S. Leapman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28020-28029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), we have shown by electron microscopy techniques that acidocalcisomes correspond to the electron-dense vacuoles observed in whole, unstained epimastigotes and contain large amounts of phosphorus. To investigate whether pyrophosphate was present in acidocalcisomes, we treated intact epimastigotes with formaldehyde (to permeabilize their plasma membrane), followed by incubation for 30 min with yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase. This treatment resulted in complete loss of the electron density of the acidocalcisomes (Fig.4), suggesting that pyrophosphate (complexed with cations) was the main electron dense material of these organelles. No changes were observed in control cells exposed to the same treatment without pyrophosphatase (Fig. 4 A). To confirm the presence of pyrophosphate in acidocalcisomes, these organelles were separated on Percoll gradients as described previously (4Scott D.A. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Zhong L. Lu H.-G. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22151-22158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and analyzed for the presence of pyrophosphate both enzymatically and by 31P NMR. The fractionation procedure was carried out in the presence of 15 mm potassium fluoride to inhibit endogenous pyrophosphatase activity (4Scott D.A. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Zhong L. Lu H.-G. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22151-22158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The densest fraction (fraction 1) from the Percoll gradients contained a significant amount (23% of the total pyrophosphate recovered) of cellular pyrophosphate (Fig.5), which correlated well with the distribution of proton-translocating pyrophosphatase activity, an acidocalcisomal marker (4Scott D.A. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Zhong L. Lu H.-G. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22151-22158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Standard transmission electron microscopy of the densest fraction showed that it contained organelles similar to the acidocalcisomes seen in intact cells (Fig.6) (3Scott D.A. Docampo R. Dvorak J.A. Shi S. Leapman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28020-28029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The 31P NMR spectrum of combined fractions 1–3 (Fig.7 A) contains a resonance at −0.8 ppm, attributed to pyrophosphate in the acidic environment of acidocalcisomes, plus a resonance at −5.4 ppm, which is the expected chemical shift of free pyrophosphate at the pH (8.0) of the experiment. Two peaks attributable to orthophosphate at 2.4 and 2.5 ppm were also detected. This suggested that resonances from both pyrophosphate and orthophosphate inside and outside acidocalcisomes were being detected. On addition of 0.1% Triton X-100 (to disrupt the acidocalcisomal membrane), and in the presence of KF to inhibit the acidocalcisomal pyrophosphatase (4Scott D.A. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Zhong L. Lu H.-G. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22151-22158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), there was a large increase in the intensity of the −5.4 ppm peak, due to pyrophosphate release from most acidocalcisomes (Fig. 7 B), whereas the two orthophosphate resonances collapsed to a single peak at −5.4 ppm. Notably, in the absence of KF (Fig. 7 C), there was no detectable peak at −5.4 ppm, which can be attributed to the rapid hydrolysis of inorganic pyrophosphate to phosphate. Thus, these 31P NMR results strongly support the idea that a significant amount of pyrophosphate is located in the acidocalcisomes. However, both the [32P]orthophosphate-labeling experiments (Fig. 3) and the fractionation studies (Fig. 5) suggest the presence of a significant amount of pyrophosphate in other compartments, including the cytosolic fraction, contributing to the overall high PPi level.Figure 731 P NMR spectra of acidocalcisomes. 31P NMR spectra of acidocalcisomal fractions of T. cruzi epimastigotes taken directly from Percoll gradients and adjusted to pH 8.0.

The T. cruzi acidocalcisomal pyrophosphatase was inhibited in vitro (4Scott D.A. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Zhong L. Lu H.-G. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22151-22158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) by a nonmetabolizable pyrophosphate analog, 2-aminoethylene-1,1-bisphosphonate, as seen previously with theVigna radiata enzyme (17Zhen R.-G. Baykov A.A. Bakuleva N.P. Rea P.A. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This suggested that bisphosphonate derivatives might interfere with parasite growth. To test this idea, we monitored the growth of T. cruziamastigotes in L6E9 myoblasts in the presence of different concentrations of the bisphosphonate pamidronate (3-amino-1-hydroxypropylidene)bisphosphonate), a bisphosphonate currently used clinically in the treatment of bone resorption disorders (18Rogers M.J. Watts D.J. Russell R.G.G. Cancer. 1997; 80: 1652-1660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Results are shown in Fig.8 A. Amastigote proliferation, as assayed by uracil incorporation, was significantly inhibited, with a 50% inhibition at about 65 μm pamidronate. [3H]Uracil incorporation in the presence of different concentrations of pamidronate correlated closely with the number of parasites per 100 host cells in Giemsa-stained monolayers under the conditions used. The linear correlation coefficient for the data was 0.991 (data not shown). No toxicity to the host cells, as assessed by phase contrast microscopy observation of detachment, vacuolation, and rounding of the cells, was detected except at high concentrations of bisphosphonates (>300 μm), as reported before (19Cecchini M.G. Fleisch H. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1990; 5: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Invasion of host cells by the parasite was not affected by this compound. Other bisphosphonates were also effective in inhibiting intracellular proliferation of T. cruzi. Alendronate (4-amino-1-hydroxybutylidene)bisphosphonate) was as effective as pamidronate against this parasite (IC50 = 65 μm), whereas risedronate (1-hydroxy-2-(3-pyridinyl)-ethylidene)bisphosphonate) was less effective (IC50 = ∼300 μm). When tested on the vacuolar acidocalcisomal pyrophosphatase activity, the inhibitory concentrations were higher (IC50 = 256 and 90 μm for alendronate and pamidronate, respectively, whereas 500 μm risedronate inhibited the pyrophosphatase activity by only 25%). We also tested the activity of pamidronate in a murine model of acute Chagas' disease (14Urbina J.A. Payares G. Molina J. Sanoja C. Liendo A. Lazardi K. Piras M.M. Piras R. Perez N. Wincker P.

Pamidronate given intravenously to mice with an acute T. cruzi infection completely arrested the development of parasitemia during treatment (Fig. 8 B); parasitemia levels remained at <3 and <15% of those in control animals 2 and 6 days after the end of treatment, respectively.

TNFα binds two distinct cell surface receptors, TNFR1 (55 kDa) or TNFR2 (75 kDa) (11Vandenabelee P. Declercg W. Beyaert R. Fiers W.

Whereas TNFR2 binds TNFα more tightly, TNFR1 is thought to be the predominant receptor that signals both cytotoxic and inflammatory responses. The cytoplasmic domains of these receptors do not possess any catalytic activity although they do contain binding sites for other receptor-associated proteins that mediate the signaling responses triggered by TNFα (12Beutler B.

In addition to the activation of JNK and induction of apoptosis, TNFα also activates the ERK pathway. However, Raf1 activation, which is a key step in ERK activation by receptor tyrosine kinases, has been observed in response to TNFα only in some (4Belka C. Wiegmann K. Adam D. Holland R. Neulloh M.

Recently, the TNF receptor has been found to interact with the adaptor protein Grb2 and the exchange factor SOS in response to TNFα (35Hildt E. Oess S. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1707-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In other circumstances, these interactions lead to Ras and Raf1 activation, but in response to TNFα, it may not be sufficient for ERK activation. An alternative derives from the observation that TNFα induces neutral and acidic sphingomyelinases that convert sphingomyelin to the secondary messenger, ceramide (reviewed in Ref. 36Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar). It has been reported that ceramide produced by neutral sphingomyelinase activates the ERK pathway through the sequential activation of ceramide-activated protein kinase and Raf1 (4Belka C. Wiegmann K. Adam D. Holland R. Neulloh M. Hermann F. Kronke M. Brach M.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1156-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar,31Yao B. Zhang Y. Delikat S. Mathias S. Basu S. Kolesnick R. Nature. 1995; 378: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In apparent contrast to these results, Muller et al.(33Muller G. Storz P. Bourteele S. Doppler H. Pfizenmaier K. Mischak H. Philipp A. Kaiser C. Kolch W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 732-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) demonstrated that ceramide directly binds Raf1, but this interaction leads to the formation of an inactive complex with GTP-Ras. Thus, whereas ERK activation is known to be a direct consequence of TNF stimulation by TNFR1 and TNFR2, the mediation through Raf1 is still uncertain. Recently, three groups reported the isolation of a novel serine-threonine kinase RIP2 (also known as RICK or CARDIAK) (37Inohara N. del Peso L. Koseki T. Chen S. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12296-12300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 38McCarthy J.V. Ni J. Dixit V. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 8: 885-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RIP2 is homologous to RIP and interacts with members of the TNFR-1, CD40, and Fas signaling complexes, in particular with TRAF1, TRAF5, TRAF6 (38McCarthy J.V. Ni J. Dixit V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16968-16975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), and TRAF2 (39Thome M. Hofmann K. Burns K. Martinon F. Bodmer J.L. Mattmann C. Tschopp J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 885-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RIP2 contains an N-terminal kinase domain and a C-terminal caspase-recruiting domain (CARD) domain that binds CLARP, caspase-1, and caspase-8. RIP2 can activate NF-κB and can induce apoptosis, although none of these activities was shown to be dependent on the kinase activity of RIP2. We independently isolated RIP2 and show here that RIP2 kinase activity directly activates ERK1/2 and appears to mediate TNF-dependent ERK activation. These results describe a novel pathway of ERK activation and the first catalytic function ascribed to any of the RIP-like kinases associated with the TNF receptor superfamily. RIP2 was cloned from a human fetal lung cDNA library in pRK vector using standard hybridization methods. The oligonucleotides used for screening were designed from an EST sequence homologous to Raf1 which was obtained from the Incyte data base. An oligonucleotide encoding the FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) was cloned in frame to the N terminus to generate FLAG-RIP2. FLAG-RIP2(D146A) was generated by in vitro mutagenesis (Stratagene) and confirmed by DNA sequencing and Western analysis. COS-7 and 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 nml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. CHO cells were maintained in F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (provided by C. Crowley, Genentech, Inc.) containing 5% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Transient transfections were all carried out using Superfect (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions. For Pathdetect and Luciferase reporter assays, 2 × 105 cells on 6-well (35-mm) dishes were used. For co-immunoprecipitations and kinase assays, 2 × 106cells were seeded on 100-mm dishes. Expression plasmids pUSE-Ras, pUSE-Ras(L61Q), pUSE-RasN17, pUSE-Raf1, and pUSE-ERK2 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Human recombinant TNFα and EGF were from R & D Systems. RIP2 deletion plasmids (311–541) and (455–541) were provided by J. McCarthy and V. M. Dixit (38McCarthy J.V. Ni J. Dixit V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16968-16975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Raf1(K375M) was generated by subcloning Raf1 into pRK5D and performing in vitro mutagenesis using the Gene Editor System (Promega). Mutagenesis was confirmed by DNA sequencing and Western analysis. In vivo c-Jun and Elk1 phosphorylation was determined using the Pathdetect c-Jun and Elk1 Trans-Reporting Systems (Stratagene). Reporter plasmids pFR-Luc, pAP1-Luc, and pSRE-Luc were from Stratagene, and pRL-TK was from Promega. Firefly and Renilla luciferase assays were performed using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter assay system (Promega). The fold induction of luciferase expression is calculated by obtaining the ratios of firefly luciferase to Renilla luciferase units for each gene and dividing the result with that of the vector control. Transiently transfected cells (100-mm dishes) were lysed in Co-IP buffer (200 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mmNaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mmsodium pyrophosphate, and 2 mm orthovanadate) containing complete protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Samples were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with either anti-Raf1 agarose-conjugated antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-FLAG M2 affinity beads (IBI, Eastman Kodak Co.). Immunoprecipitates were washed three times in lysis buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Novex), and immunoblotted using rabbit polyclonal anti-FLAG (IBI Kodak), anti-Raf1, anti-Ras (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phosphoprotein antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), or with phospho-specific p44/42 MAP kinase (T202/Y212) antibody (Promega or NEB) and then visualized using the ECL system (Pierce). Unless otherwise indicated all results were reproduced in at least two independent experiments. Transfected cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated in RIPA buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS and protease inhibitor mixture) with rabbit polyclonal agarose-conjugated anti-ERK2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-FLAG, or anti-Raf1 antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and once with kinase wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 15 mmMgCl2). Kinase assays were performed at 30 °C for 30 min in 30 μl of Assay Dilution Buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 6.5 mm MgCl2, and 5 μm ATP) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) containing 20 μm protein kinase C inhibitor peptide, 2 μm protein kinase A inhibitor peptide, and 20 μm calmodulin inhibitor (compound R24571) and supplemented with 100 mm[γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). ERK2 activity was assayed by using 2.0 μg of MBP substrate (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). To assay for RIP2 activity, 0.5 μg of purified uninduced ERK2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) was added with MBP. To assay for Raf1 activity, 0.5 μg of purified uninduced MEK1, 0.5 μg of ERK2, and 2 μg of MBP were added to the reaction. Alternative substrates used include 1.0 μg of GST-ERK1 (K71A) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and 2.0 μg of poly-His-MEK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Stress-activated protein kinase/Jun NH2-terminal kinase activity was assayed using materials and protocols provided by Bio-Rad. Unless otherwise indicated, all results were reproduced in at least two independent experiments. In a search for additional kinases that could be implicated in the MAP kinase pathway, we searched EST data bases and identified an open reading frame that has significant homology to the kinase domain of Raf1. By using the EST sequence, we isolated a novel full-length human cDNA that contains a 1623-base pair open reading frame, encodes 540 amino acid residues, and has a predicted molecular mass of about 60 kDa. While this work was in preparation, the cloning and pro-apoptotic activity of this kinase was reported by three other groups (37Inohara N. del Peso L. Koseki T. Chen S. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12296-12300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 38McCarthy J.V. Ni J. Dixit V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16968-16975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 39Thome M. Hofmann K. Burns K. Martinon F. Bodmer J.L. Mattmann C. Tschopp J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 885-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In accordance with the earlier published nomenclature and because of its extensive homology to both the kinase and intermediate domains of RIP (21% identity), we refer to the kinase we report here as RIP2. In addition to having high homology with the RAF family of kinases (24% identity), the kinase domain of RIP2 also contains two TEY motifs (amino acid residues 95–97 and 111–113) which are conserved in the ERK family of kinases but are not found in RIP. All MAPKs contain signature TXY motifs within the activating phosphorylation site, and the X residue distinguishes the three subfamilies of MAPKs (ERK, JNK, and p38) (40Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 470-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). We therefore determined whether RIP2 can activate any of the MAP kinase pathways. We examined whether expression of RIP2 in a heterologous system can stimulate the transcription of a luciferase reporter controlled by promoters containing either AP-1 or SRE elements. The AP-1 complex is composed of members of the c-Jun and c-Fos families and is regulated by the phosphorylation of c-Jun by the JNK kinase and c-Fos by c-Fos-regulating kinase (41Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar). The SRE element is found in the promoter region of c-Fos and is activated by the transcription factor Elk1, a ternary complex factor protein that binds SRE through direct DNA interaction and cooperation with the serum response factor. Elk1 can be phosphorylated and activated by either ERK or JNK kinases. Fig.1 A shows that RIP2 can activate both the AP-1 and SRE promoters. Expression of a kinase-deficient variant D146A, which eliminates the conserved catalytic base in the kinase subdomain VI, has a significantly reduced activity in both assays. RIP2 expression may increase AP-1 activity by directly activating the JNK pathway. Alternatively, as RIP2 can activate SRE promoters, AP-1 may be activated indirectly by the increased expression of c-Fos through the activation of the ERK pathway. To distinguish between these possibilities, we examined whether RIP2 could activate Elk1 or c-Junin vivo. We measured the ability of Elk1 or c-Jun (expressed as GAL4 fusion proteins) to activate a GAL4-regulated reporter in response to the increased expression of RIP2. Fig. 1 B shows that the expression of RIP2 led to the activation of Elk1 but not c-Jun indicating that RIP2 directly activates the ERK but not the JNK pathway. The extent of Elk1 activation is dependent on the level of RIP2 expression (Fig. 1 C) and also on the kinase activity of RIP2 (Fig. 1 D). The residual Elk1 activation resulting from increased expression of RIP2 (D146A) may be due in part to contributions made by other regions of RIP2 (see Fig.7 B). To determine how RIP2 may specifically activate Elk1, we examined whether RIP2 can activate and phosphorylate any of the major components of the ERK signaling pathway. Fig. 2 Ashows that RIP2 activated exogenously added ERK2 to phosphorylate MBPin vitro. Similar results were obtained with the addition of ERK1 (data not shown). No significant increase in MBP phosphorylation was observed subsequent to the addition of MEK1, suggesting that RIP2 activated ERK2 directly. In the control experiment, Raf1 induced the phosphorylation of MBP in vitro only with the addition and subsequent activation of purified unactivated MEK1 and ERK2. RIP2 was also able to phosphorylate ERK2 directly (Fig. 2 A, middle panel) but not MEK1 (data not shown but see Fig.6 D). The activation and phosphorylation of ERK2 appears to be mediated directly by the kinase activity of RIP2 since the RIP2(D146A) mutant failed to phosphorylate or activate ERK2 in a similar assay (Fig. 2 B). Western analysis of ERK2 with an antibody raised specifically against phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase (Thr-202/Tyr-212) revealed that RIP2, but not the D146A mutant, phosphorylated ERK2 on the activating TEY sites in vivo(Fig. 2 C). Furthermore, RIP2 was able to phosphorylate a kinase-deficient GST-ERK1(K71A) in vitro also in a manner dependent on the kinase activity of RIP2, suggesting that that increased phosphorylation of ERK was not due to its enhanced autophosphorylation activity (Fig. 2 D). These results indicate that RIP2 is an ERK kinase that can directly phosphorylate and activate ERK1 and ERK2. Ras and Raf1 are known to play central roles in regulating ERK activation. We then investigated whether Ras or Raf1 can influence the activation of ERK2 by RIP2 in vivo. Fig.3 shows that the expression of RIP2, Ras, or Raf1 independently activates ERK, whereas co-expression of RIP2 with Ras (Fig. 3 A) or with Raf1 (Fig. 3 B) further induced ERK2 activity. The cooperative interaction between RIP2 and Ras or between RIP2 and Raf1 suggests an activating interaction between these molecules. Since RIP2 activates ERK directly, Ras and Raf1 could possibly play a role in enhancing RIP2 activity toward ERK. The cooperative interactions between RIP2 and Ras or Raf1 suggest the possibility that RIP2 could physically interact with either of these molecules. Transient transfection and co-immunoprecipitation using anti-Raf1 antibodies revealed that Raf1 interacted with FLAG-RIP2 and RIP2(D146A) in vivo (Fig.4 A). The reduction in the amount of RIP2(D146A) that co-immunoprecipitated with Raf1 (as compared with RIP2) in Fig. 4 A may reflect a requirement for this region of the molecule for full interaction with Raf1. The specificity of this interaction was also confirmed by immunoprecipitating RIP2 using FLAG beads and performing Western analysis with Raf1 antibody (data not shown). Furthermore, Raf1 was found to interact only with FLAG-RIP2 but not with an unrelated protein FLAG-Nsp1 (42Lu Y. Brush J. Stewart T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10047-10052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) (Fig.4 B). The binding of RIP2 to Raf1 was enhanced by the co-expression of constitutively active Ha-Ras (GTP-Ras), which contains an activating substitution (L61Q) that was previously shown to increase nucleotide exchange (GTP for GDP) as well as decrease GTP hydrolysis in Ras (43Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 C, the amount of RIP2 present in Raf1 immunoprecipitates increased with the amount of GTP-Ras that coincidentally interacted with Raf1. A conformational change in Raf1 as a consequence of its interaction with GTP-Ras (44Tzivion G. Luo Z. Avruch J. Nature. 1998; 394: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) may induce the increased affinity for RIP2. Conversely, increased expression of the dominant negative RasN17 decreased the amount of RIP2 that interacted with Raf1 (Fig. 4 D) consistent with the possibility that an active Raf1 is required to bind RIP2. The presence of RIP2 in the Ras-Raf1-RIP2 complex does not appear to be mediated by a Ras-RIP2 interaction as we could not detect any direct interaction between RIP2 and Ras by co-immunoprecipitation (data not shown). The Raf1-Rip2 interaction led us to examine whether Raf1 could directly phosphorylate and activate RIP2. First, we determined whether co-expression and co-immunoprecipitation of Raf1 with the kinase-inactive RIP2(D146A) would induce the phosphorylation of RIP2(D146A) in vitro when Raf1 is activated by GTP-Ras. Raf1 activation achieved through co-expression with increasing amounts of GTP-Ras led to an increased phosphorylation of RIP2(D146A) (Fig.5 A, panel a, lanes 3–5). The phosphorylation of RIP2(D146A) appears to be due to the kinase activity of Raf1 itself since the amount of phosphorylation associated with RIP2(D146A) was significantly reduced when the kinase-inactive Raf1(K375M) was used (Fig. 5 A, panel d). We also determined whether increasing Raf1 activation enhances the ability of RIP2 to activate ERK2 in vitro. Transiently expressed FLAG-RIP2 and Raf1 were co-immunoprecipitated in the presence or absence of GTP-Ras and assayed for ERK2 activation. As shown on Fig.5 B, Raf1 expression and activation by GTP-Ras further increased ERK2 activation by RIP2. This effect also appears to be mediated directly by the kinase activity of Raf1 since expression of Raf1(K375M) was significantly less effective in activating RIP2. Expression of GTP-Ras in the absence of Raf1 did not directly lead to an increase in RIP2 activity (Fig. 5 C) nor RIP2 expression (data not shown). These results therefore suggest that Raf1, when activated by GTP-Ras, can phosphorylate RIP2 and can further stimulate it to activate ERK2. Despite the interaction with Raf1, RIP2 does not appear to phosphorylate Raf1. Fig.6 A shows that transiently expressed Raf1 does not possess any discernible autophosphorylation activity (lane 2), but it becomes phosphorylated when constitutively active Ras L61Q (GTP-Ras) is co-expressed (lane 7). Although RIP2 appears to phosphorylate itself in Raf1 immunoprecipitates, increased binding of RIP2 to Raf1 did not cause any concomitant increase in the phosphorylation of Raf1 in vitro(lanes 3–6). The failure to phosphorylate Raf1 suggests that RIP2 does not activate Raf1. To examine this, we assayed Raf1 immunoprecipitates containing increasing amounts of RIP2 for their ability to activate exogenously added ERK2 in the presence (Fig. 6 B) or absence (Fig.6 C) of MEK1. There was significant phosphorylation of MBP by Raf1 only after Raf1 was activated by GTP-Ras and when assayed in the presence of both MEK1 and ERK2 (compare lanes 2 and7 in Fig. 6, B and C). In contrast, increased binding of RIP2 did not increase phosphorylation of Raf1 (Fig. 6 A) or the activation of Raf1 toward MEK1 (Fig.6 D). The slight increase in MBP phosphorylation detected with increasing RIP2 in Fig. 6, B and C, can be accounted for by the increase in the amount of RIP2 that co-immunoprecipitated with Raf1 and that activated ERK2 directly. That Raf1 is not activated is most clearly seen in Fig. 6 D where the Raf1 immunoprecipitates, in the presence of RIP2 but absence of GTP-Ras, have no detectable MEK1 phosphorylation activity. These results therefore suggest that RIP2 does not activate Raf1. RIP2 was earlier reported to interact with the TRAF1 and TRAF2 adaptor molecules that associate with members of the TNF receptor superfamily (38McCarthy J.V. Ni J. Dixit V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16968-16975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 39Thome M. Hofmann K. Burns K. Martinon F. Bodmer J.L. Mattmann C. Tschopp J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 885-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TRAF2, in particular, has been shown to signal the activation of the JNK but not the ERK pathway from both TNFR1 and TNFR2 (28Reinhard C. Shamoon B. Shymala V. Williams L.T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1080-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Results presented above indicate that RIP2 activates and interacts with members of the ERK pathway. As TNFα also activates ERK (4Belka C. Wiegmann K. Adam D. Holland R. Neulloh M. Hermann F. Kronke M. Brach M.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1156-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 5Winston B.W. Riches D.W. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1525-1533PubMed Google Scholar, 6Winston B.W. Lange-Carter C.A. Gardner A.M. Johnson G.L. Riches D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1614-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), it is possible that RIP2 could be involved in the activation of ERK by TNFα. To examine this, we expressed various kinase-deficient point and deletion mutants of RIP2 (Fig.7 A) and determined whether these would block the activating phosphorylation of ERK2 by TNFα through Western analysis using a phospho-specific p44/42 MAP kinase (Thr-202/Tyr-212) antibody. To determine specificity, we also examined whether the same RIP2 mutants could block the activation of ERK2 by EGF or of c-Jun by TNF. Fig. 7 B shows that stimulation of the cells by TNFα or EGF led to an increase in the activation or phosphorylation of ERK2 or c-Jun in vivo (lanes 1and 2). Expression of the different RIP2 variants alone did not induce ERK2 activation in unstimulated cells (lanes 3, 7, and 11). However, the increased expression of these variants significantly reduced the activation of ERK2 upon TNF stimulation (upper panel) but had only minimal effect on activation induced by EGF (middle panel). In addition, the dominant negative effects of these RIP2 mutants were only observed for TNF-induced ERK activation but not for c-Jun activation (lower panel). The dominant negative effect shown by the D146A mutant (upper panel, lanes 4–6) suggests that the kinase activity of RIP2 is required for TNF-dependent ERK activation. That the level of ERK2 activation in TNF-stimulated cells expressing only the CARD domain (455–541, lanes 12–14) was lower than in cells expressing both the intermediate and CARD domains (311–541,lanes 8–10) suggests that the intermediate domain of RIP2 may also participate in ERK signaling. Similarly, the more efficient blocking by the kinase deletion variants compared with that of the point mutant (D146A) indicates that other regions within the kinase domain may also contribute in transducing the signal. These results therefore underscore the importance of the kinase domain of RIP2 in mediating ERK2 activation by TNFα. RIP2 was originally isolated based on its homology to CARD and was shown to associate with members of the TNFR-1, CD40, and Fas signaling complexes and to induce NF-κB, JNK, and apoptosis. Like RIP, the induction of these responses by RIP2 does not appear to involve its kinase activity as kinase-inactive variants of RIP2 are still capable of engaging these pathways (38McCarthy J.V. Ni J. Dixit V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16968-16975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 39Thome M. Hofmann K. Burns K. Martinon F. Bodmer J.L. Mattmann C. Tschopp J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 885-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We independently isolated RIP2 and have demonstrated that RIP2 functions as a novel activating MAPK kinase that may modulate ERK signaling by TNFα. First, RIP2 expression induces SRE-regulated gene expression (Fig. 1 A), Elk1 activation (Fig. 1 D), and ERK phosphorylation and activation (Fig. 2). All of these activities were significantly reduced when a kinase-inactive RIP2(D146A) variant was used. Second, RIP2 interacts with components of the ERK signaling pathway (Fig. 4) and cooperates with these molecules in promoting the activation of ERK2 (Fig. 3). Third, RIP2 mutants lacking a functional kinase activity can significantly reduce the activation of ERK2 by TNFα (Fig. 7). Despite having a high sequence similarity to the kinase domain of Raf1, RIP2 apparently behaves more like MEK1. RIP2 binds to and is activated by Ras-activated Raf1 (Fig. 5), and RIP2 appears to phosphorylate and activate ERK1 and ERK2 directly (Fig. 2). In contrast, RIP2 does not phosphorylate or activate Raf1 (Fig. 6) or MEK1 (Fig. 2 A). Although RIP2 possesses an active kinase activity even in the absence of any exogenous stimuli, it can be further activated by Ras-activated Raf1 (Fig. 5). This activation is also reflected in the association between Raf1 and RIP2 which is enhanced by activated Ras (Fig.4 C) and is diminished by a dominant negative mutant of Ras (Fig. 4 D). Although it is clear that TNFα can activate the ERK pathway, the role of Raf1 in this process remains controversial (33Muller G. Storz P. Bourteele S. Doppler H. Pfizenmaier K. Mischak H. Philipp A. Kaiser C. Kolch W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 732-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Yao et al. (31Yao B. Zhang Y. Delikat S. Mathias S. Basu S. Kolesnick R. Nature. 1995; 378: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) have proposed that the secondary messenger ceramide, produced by TNF stimulation, can activate ceramide-activated protein kinase to phosphorylate and activate Raf1 directly. More recent studies, however, have shown that ceramide binds Raf1 directly but induces Raf1 to form an inactive complex (relative to MEK1 activation) with GTP-Ras (33Muller G. Storz P. Bourteele S. Doppler H. Pfizenmaier K. Mischak H. Philipp A. Kaiser C. Kolch W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 732-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the ceramide-activated protein kinase-induced phosphorylation of Raf1 was mapped to Thr-268/269 which are Raf1 autophosphorylation sites rather than the known MEK1-activating phosphorylation sites (45Morrison D.K. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Copeland T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17309-17316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the phosphorylation of these sites may serve to redirect the substrate specificity of Raf1 to yet unknown substrates different from MEK1. This substrate may be RIP2. That kinase-deleted variants of RIP2 can significantly block ERK activation in response to TNFα suggests that RIP2 could be a major transducer of this pathway (Fig. 7 C). As Raf1 can phosphorylate and activate RIP2, it is possible that in the case of TNF signaling, either Raf1 bound to ceramide or Raf1 phosphorylated by ceramide-activated protein kinase could have its specificity shifted toward RIP2. It was recently shown that the adaptor protein Grb2 directly interacts with the TNF receptor in a TNF-dependent fashion (35Hildt E. Oess S. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1707-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This complex consequently recruits SOS which leads to the activation of Ras and Raf1. This process is similar to that activated by receptor tyrosine kinases, although in this case, additional steps are apparently required to achieve full ERK activation. Our data suggest the possibility that recruitment of RIP2 by TRAFs, coupled to its activation by Raf1 within the TNF receptor complex, may fulfill at least some of the missing requirements. Furthermore, the use of RIP2 as an alternative to MEK1 may be to contribute to a faster and more specific signal transmission in TNF signaling to ERK. There are multiple MAPK cascades within a cell and the same subset of kinases can be used, yet different effector proteins are activated depending on the stimulus. There is increasing support for the concept that specific adaptor molecules are used to assemble and route these proteins to prevent or facilitate cross-talk between pathways (46Elion E.A. Science. 1998; 281: 1625-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). For example, kinase suppressor of Ras was shown to facilitate Ras signal transmission possibly by shuttling MEK1 from the cytoplasm to activated Raf1 at the membrane (47Denouel-Galy A. Douville E.M. Warne P.H. Papin C. Laugier D. Calothy G. Downward J. Eychene A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 8: 46-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 48Therrien M. Michaud N.R. Rubin G.M.

Biol. 1997; 8: 56-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Similarly, the adaptor protein MP1 appears to associate selectively with ERK1 and MEK1, and not MEK2 or ERK2, to enhance ERK1 activation (50Schaeffer H.J. Catling A.D. Eblen S.T. Collier L.S. Krauss A. Weber M.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1668-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Whereas the kinase suppressor of Ras facilitates MEK1 activation by Ras and Raf1, a similar protein may be involved in RIP2 activation by Ras and Raf1. Although distinct signaling responses are induced by TNFα, functional interactions exist between these pathways. For example, both NF-κB and apoptosis are induced by TNFα, and one consequence of NF-κB activation is the prevention of apoptosis, perhaps through the TRAF-mediated suppression of caspase 8 (51Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2931) Google Scholar, 52Liu Z. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M.

Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2566) Google Scholar). A similar dichotomy may exist for RIP2. Thus RIP2 is pro-apoptotic via the interaction of its CARD domain with CLARP, caspase-1, or caspase-8 (37Inohara N. del Peso L. Koseki T. Chen S. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12296-12300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and anti-apoptotic via activation of the ERKs (this report). The activation of the RIP2 kinase activity could positively regulate cell proliferation and survival, whereas negative regulators of RIP2 kinase could favor caspase activation and promote cell death. Whether and how RIP2 may coordinate the balance between life and death in response to TNF stimulation is an important question that will be addressed in future experiments.

EGF was sequentially cleaved by endosomal proteases at a limited number of sites, which were identified by high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. EGF proteolysis is initiated by hydrolysis at the C-terminal Glu51-Leu52 bond. Three additional minor cleavage sites were identified at positions Arg48-Trp49, Trp49-Trp50, and Trp50-Glu51 after prolonged incubation. Using nondenaturating immunoprecipitation and cross-linking procedures, the major proteolytic activity was identified as that of the cysteine protease cathepsin-B. The effect of injected EGF on subsequent endosomal EGF receptor (EGFR) proteolysis was further evaluated by immunoblotting. Using endosomal fractions prepared from EGF-injected rats and incubated in vitro, the EGFR was lost with a time course superimposable with the loss of phosphotyrosine content. The cathepsin-B proinhibitor CA074-Me inhibited both in vivoand in vitro the endosomal degradation of the EGFR and increased the tyrosine phosphorylation states of the EGFR protein and the molecule SHC within endosomes. The data, therefore, describe a unique pathway for the endosomal processing of internalized EGF receptor complexes, which involves the sequential function of cathepsin-B through selective degradation of both the ligand and receptor.

Di Guglielmo G.M. Authier F. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and within the receptor tyrosine kinase family, significant similarities and differences have emerged in attenuation mechanisms (2Authier F. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J.M. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. Cellular Proteolytic Systems. 15. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1994: 89-113Google Scholar, 3Authier F. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J.M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). One area of research into the differing signaling outcomes of the receptor tyrosine kinases involves the intraendosomal processing of the internalized ligands and how this affects tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor tyrosine kinases as well as their substrates (1Baass P.C. Di Guglielmo G.M. Authier F. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the ligand degradation state within the endosomes contributes to both the location and specificity of downstream signaling (1Baass P.C. Di Guglielmo G.M. Authier F. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 4Authier F. Di Guglielmo G.M. Danielsen G.M. Bergeron J.J.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 421-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Suggestive evidence has come from the differences in the levels of endosomal degradation of EGF1 and transforming growth factor α (TGFα) after internalization, which coincided with altered receptor trafficking (5Ebner R. Derynck R. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 599-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and was linked to the different biopotency observed for the two ligands. Recently, using the in situliver model system for signal transduction, we have shown an alteration in insulin receptor phosphorylation and trafficking through the endosomal pathway in response to the insulin analog H2, a genetically engineered analog that displays a reduced rate of proteolysis in endosomes as compared with authentic insulin (4Authier F. Di Guglielmo G.M. Danielsen G.M. Bergeron J.J.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 421-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Hence, the balance between net tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in the endosome is regulated directly or indirectly by ligand proteolysis. EGF binding to its receptor rapidly induces receptor-mediated endocytosis through clathrin-coated pits (6Sorkin A. Carpenter G. Science. 1993; 261: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Coincidentally, internalized EGF receptor (EGFR) complexes are subject to poorly defined proteolytic processes that alter their integrity and/or activity. Understanding the metabolic regulation of EGF and its receptor throughout the hepatic endosomal and lysosomal apparatus is of particular interest, as (a) in mammals, the highest concentration of the EGFR is found in liver parenchyma (7Cohen S. Fava R. Sawyer S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6237-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and (b) activation of the EGFR in adult liver has been linked to organ repair through increased mitogenesis (8Fausto N. Laird A.D. Webber E.M. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1527-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Moreover, truncated EGFRs that retained their kinase activity but were internalization-defective led to enhanced mitogenesis and cellular transformation, implying a relationship between internalization and attenuation (9Wells A. Welsh J.B. Lazar C.S. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1990; 247: 962-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Indirect observations have suggested that EGF is proteolytically processed in endosomes to different forms that are truncated at their carboxyl termini (10Renfrew C.A. Hubbard A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4348-4356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas N-terminal processing can be monitored by conventional automated protein sequencing techniques using Edman degradation, no such method has been available for the study of C-terminal processing, and thus, the cleavage sites within the EGF sequence remained undefined. In this paper, we demonstrate the application of mass spectrometry for such a study. Cathepsin B (EC 3.4.22.1) is an endosomal/lysosomal cysteine protease of the papain superfamily (11Mort J.S. Buttle D.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Its main function is the degradation of peptides, proteins, and toxins that enter the endolysosomal system from outside the cell (via endocytosis or phagocytosis) (2Authier F. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J.M. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. Cellular Proteolytic Systems. 15. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1994: 89-113Google Scholar, 3Authier F. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J.M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) or from other compartments within the cell (via autophagy) (11Mort J.S. Buttle D.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The data presented below demonstrate that cathepsin B down-regulates EGF receptor complexes within endosomes by inducing proteolytic cleavages that yield C-terminal truncated forms of EGF and undefined receptor fragments. Characterization (N-terminal sequence and mass analyses) of mouse EGF (Receptor grade, Collaborative Biomedical Products) revealed that this lot (lot 907472) is an unequal mixture of mainly full-length EGF-(1–53) and two N-terminally truncated EGF fragments (EGF-(2–53) and EGF-(3–53)) in the relative proportion 64:29:7, respectively.

The cytosolic fraction (80 μg of protein) and soluble endosomal extract (40 μg of protein) were incubated in a final volume of 40 μl of 25 mm citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 4–8, with [125I]EGF (3 × 105 cpm) in the presence or absence of native EGF and protease inhibitors. After 20 min at 21 °C, cross-linking was initiated by the addition of bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate to a final concentration of 0.3 mm and allowed to proceed for 15 min at 21 °C. The cross-linking reaction was terminated by the addition of 2 μl of 1m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. In some experiments, the subcellular fractions were immunodepleted for IDE (cytosolic fraction) or cathepsin B (soluble endosomal extract) prior to the cross-linking procedure. The hepatic fractions were incubated with either monoclonal anti-human IDE 9B12 (5 μg/ml) (for the cytosolic fraction) or with rabbit polyclonal anti-procathepsin B (1:500 dilution) (for the endosomal fraction) for 16 h at 4 °C in 100 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The monoclonal and polyclonal IgGs were precipitated by the addition of 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose. After rotating for 2 h at room temperature, the fractions were centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g av, and the resultant supernatants were subjected to cross-linking as described above. The samples were heated for 1 min at 100 °C in 1% in SDS, 2% β-mercaptoethanol and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in an 8% acrylamide resolving gel according to the method of Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206615) Google Scholar). Soluble endosomal extract (about 1 ng) was incubated for various lengths of time at 37 °C with 10−6m EGF, insulin, or glucagon in 400 μl of 50 mm citrate-phosphate, pH 4–8, in the presence or absence of protease inhibitors. The samples were then acidified with acetic acid (15%) and immediately loaded onto a reverse-phase HPLC column. In some experiments, the soluble endosomal extract was immunodepleted of active cathepsin B before the digestion step. Soluble endosomal proteins (0.1 mg/ml) were incubated with polyclonal anti-rat procathepsin B (1:500 dilution) for 16 h at 4 °C in 200 μl of 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Polyclonal IgG was precipitated by the addition of 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose. After rotating for 60 min at room temperature, the fraction was centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 ×g av, and the resultant supernatant and pellet were diluted in 100 mm citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 5, and tested for EGF-degrading activity by HPLC analysis. Native EGF was also digested in vitro with human liver cathepsin B and/or D. 10−6m EGF was incubated with 0.4 units/ml cathepsin B and/or 1.1 units/ml cathepsin D in 0.2m citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 4–5. After 15–60 min of incubation at 37 °C, the proteolytic reaction was stopped by adding acetic acid (15%), and the samples were immediately analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC. Reverse-phase HPLC was performed on a Waters model 600 liquid chromatograph equipped with a model U6K sample injector fitted with a 500-μl loop and a μBondapak C18 column (Waters, 0.39 × 30 cm, 10 μm particle size). Samples were chromatographed using as eluent a mixture of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water (solvent A) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (solvent B) with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Elution was carried out using two sequential linear gradients followed by an isocratic elution. For EGF: an initial gradient of 2–25% solvent B (30 min), a second gradient of 25–32% solvent B (15 min), and a third isocratic elution of 32% solvent B (15 min); for insulin: an initial gradient of 2–25% solvent B (30 min), a second gradient of 25–34% solvent B (15 min), and a third isocratic elution of 34% solvent B (15 min); and for glucagon: a gradient of 2–40% solvent B (55 min). Eluates were monitored on-line for absorbance at 214 nm with a LC spectrophotometer (Waters). The major components in the eluates were collected and submitted to mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequence analyses. For matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MS) (22Yates II, J.R. J. Mass Spectrom. 1998; 33: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar), aliquots (0.5 μl) of the HPLC fractions were spotted with equal volumes of water saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid onto samples plates and analyzed employing a Voyager-DE (delayed extraction) mass spectrometer (Perseptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) in linear mode at 25 kV accelerating voltage with 87% grid voltage and 0.3% guide wire voltage. For electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS (22Yates II, J.R. J. Mass Spectrom. 1998; 33: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar), HPLC fractions were diluted 1:1 with 50% aqueous acetonitrile and analyzed by direct infusion employing a Quattro II triple quadropole mass spectrometer (Fisons, Manchester, United Kingdom). ESI acquisitions were generally done at 70 °C for 2–3 min at 10 μl/min with 3.8 kV capillary/needle voltage, 40 V sampling cone voltage, 1.0 V ion energy, and 650 V multiplier voltage. Mass spectra were obtained by scanning in the multi-channel analysis mode with a scan time of 1 s per 390 Da and 16 data acquisition points per Da. Samples were prepared for solid-phase amino acid sequencing as described previously (14Authier F. Mort J.S. Bell A.W. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15798-15807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). N-terminal sequence analysis was performed in either the on-line equipped Porton model 2090E (on-line Hewlett-Packard 1090 HPLC) or the ABI 470A gas phase (on-line 120A PTH analyzer) sequenators according to the general procedures of Hewick et al. (23Hewick R.M. Hunkapiller M.W. Hood L.E. Dreyer W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7990-7997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Potential selectivity of endosomal proteases toward various internalized substrates was assessed using unmodified polypeptides to exclude potential confounding effects of radiolabeling. The ability of the ENs to degrade, at pH 5, native EGF, insulin, and glucagon was examined (Fig. 1). Incubation of the ENs with EGF and insulin resulted in a moderate generation of degradation products with 38 and 49% proteolysis, respectively, in 30 min. With glucagon, 100% degradation was detected after the same incubation period. HPLC analysis of endosomal EGF products showed that nine peptides were produced from the native substrate (peak 9), one of which (peak 8) accounted for more than 65% of the cleavage products at any time, suggesting that it represents the major processed form of EGF within endosomes (Fig. 2). The cleavage sites in the EGF peptides were determined by a combination of mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequence analyses (Fig.3). According to the sequences of peptide products presented diagrammatically, two types of proteolytic activities participate in EGF degradation. The first one can be attributed to a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase activity, which could account for the sequential generation of peptides 8 (EGF-(1–51)) and 7 (EGF-(1–49)). The second one appears to be an endopeptidase activity, which could be responsible for the generation of peptides 4 (EGF-(1–48)) and 10 (EGF-(1–50)). Other identified peptides (peaks 1–3, 5, and 6) corresponded to the remaining C-terminal residues of the above peptide products. The effects of pH and various protease inhibitors on the EGF-degrading activity were next measured (Fig. 4). Endosomal activity peaked at pH 4–5, suggesting that an acidic protease may be involved (Fig. 4 A). At pH 5, the cysteine protease inhibitors leupeptin and E64 inhibited the EGF-degrading activity by 90% (Fig. 4 B). Similar results were obtained with CA074, a rapid and specific inactivator of cathepsin B (24Buttle D.J. Murata M. Knight C.G. Barrett A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 299: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of CA074 on endosomal EGF-degrading activity suggested that endosomal cathepsin B may be responsible for this activity. HPLC analysis of the degradation peptides produced by cathepsin B (Fig. 5) revealed three proteolytic products (peaks 1, 7, and 8) with retention times identical to those seen with ENs (see Fig. 2). Mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequence analyses revealed that EGF was cleaved at the Trp49-Trp50 and Glu51-Leu52 bonds (Fig.6), as was observed with ENs (see Fig.3). To evaluate whether the susceptibility of EGF to proteolysis is unique to cathepsin B, the activity of a previously identified endosomal endopeptidase, the aspartic acid protease cathepsin D (14Authier F.

No other degradation products were observed when pure cathepsin D or a mixture of cathepsins B and D were used, suggesting that other minor cleavages observed with ENs may be produced by another endosomal endopeptidase.Figure 6Cathepsin B generated degradation fragments of EGF-(1–53). The partial EGF sequences and fragments of EGF identified in the numbered HPLC peaks (see Fig. 5) are represented as in Fig. 3. Selected HPLC pools were characterized by ESI-MS and solid-phase N-terminal sequence analyses.

Quantitative immunoprecipitation of cathepsin B removed 85% of endosomal EGF-degrading activity. As expected, EGF hydrolysis performed on immunoprecipitate of immunocomplex-bead eluates from anti-cathepsin B immunoprecipitations led to the generation of the major cathepsin B peptide product 8. Thus, the endosomal proteolytic activity generating EGF fragments 7 and 8 appeared qualitatively similar to that of rat hepatic cathepsin B. Endosomal proteolysis of internalized polypeptides by the 110-kDa metalloprotease IDE has been suggested (27Hamel F.G. Siford G.L. Jones J. Duckworth W.C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 126: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig.8 A, cross-linking of [125I]EGF to a 110-kDa cytosolic protein was observed at neutral pH (lanes 4 and 5). This was competitively inhibited by 10−5m EGF (lane 8), by bacitracin (lane 7), and byp-hydroxymercuribenzoate (lane 9), consistent with the known properties of IDE (19Authier F. Rachubinski R.A.

This 110-kDa protein corresponded to IDE because it was immunodepleted (lane 10) by the well characterized monoclonal antibody 9B12 (13Shii K. Roth R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Comparable evaluation using the soluble endosomal extract did not reveal any protein with the molecular mass of IDE (Fig. 8 B).

KIF1C, a recently identified member of the KIF1/Unc104 family, was shown to be involved in the retrograde vesicle transport from the Golgi-apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum. In a yeast two-hybrid screen using the carboxyl-terminal 350 amino acids of KIF1C as a bait, we identified as binding proteins 14-3-3 β, γ, ε, and ζ. In addition, a clone encoding the carboxyl-terminal 290 amino acids of KIF1C was found, indicating a potential for KIF1C to dimerize. Subsequent transient overexpression experiments showed that KIF1C can dimerize efficiently. However, in untransfected cells, only a small portion of KIF1C was detected as a dimer. The association of 14-3-3 proteins with KIF1C could be confirmed in transient expression systems and in untransfected cells and was dependent on the phosphorylation of serine 1092 located in a consensus binding sequence for 14-3-3 ligands. Serine 1092 was a substrate for the protein kinase casein kinase IIin vitro, and inhibition of casein kinase II in cells diminished the association of KIF1C with 14-3-3γ. Our data thus suggest that KIF1C can form dimers and is associated with proteins of the 14-3-3 family.

All KLPs share a conserved motor domain of ∼340 amino acids, and similarities between this domain have been used to group the known members of the kinesin superfamily into a number of subfamilies. Currently, 7 subfamilies and several outgroups comprise more than 250 KLPs from different organisms. The members of each subfamily share a common domain organization, exhibit sequence homology outside of the motor domain, and have similar motility properties and cellular functions (for recent reviews see Refs. 1Moore J.D. Endow S.A. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar and 2Hirokawa N. Science. 1998; 279: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the sequences outside of the conserved motor domain are responsible for the different cellular roles of the KLPs. KLPs are involved in cell division, in the formation and elongation of the mitotic spindle, the separation of the chromosomes, and in the transport of membranous vesicles along microtubules. The identification of distinct cargoes for distinct KLPs is emerging but proceeds more slowly for vesicle transporting KLPs than for the mitotic or meiotic KLPs (3Walczak C.E. Mitchison T.J. Desai A.

Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 657-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) have not yet been conclusively characterized. Little is known about proteins binding to KLPs, although these proteins most likely mediate the association with the cargo and may be involved in the regulation of the motor activity. This has been shown for the best understood motor protein, kinesin itself, that forms a heterotetramer consisting of the dimerized heavy chains, which contain the motor activity, and two kinesin light chains, which are believed to be involved in vesicle binding and the regulation of the motor activity of the kinesin protein complex (15Verhey K.J. Lizotte D.L. Abramson T. Barenboim L. Schnapp B. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1053-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). So far, five different mammalian kinesin light chains are known, and it is suggested that these different light chains are responsible for the different functions of kinesin within the cell (16Khodjakov A. Lizunova E.M. Minin A.A. Koonce M.P. Gyoeva F.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). For the members of the KIF3 subfamily (17Muresan V. Abramson T. Lyass A. Winter D. Porro E. Hong F. Chamberlin N.L. Schnapp B.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 637-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), the KAP3 proteins are described as binding partners and probably mediate the association of the KIF3 dimers with vesicles (9Yamazaki H. Nakata T. Okada Y. Hirokawa N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8443-8448Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Other proteins found to associate with KLPs are the serine phosphatase PP2A binding to Drosophila melanogaster KLP38B (18Alphey L. Parker L. Hawcroft G. Guo Y. Kaiser K. Morgan G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 395-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the serine/threonine kinases MLK2/3 interacting with KIF3X (19Nagata K. Puls A. Futter C. Aspenstrom P. Schaefer E. Nakata T. Hirokawa N. Hall A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), Rab6 binding to Rabkinesin-6 (20Echard A. Jollivet F. Martinez O. Lacapere J.J. Rousselet A. Janoueix L.I. Goud B. Science. 1998; 279: 580-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) and the tyrosine phosphatase PTPD1 associating with KIF1C (21Dorner C. Ciossek T. Muller S. Moller P.H. Ullrich A. Lammers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20267-20275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, for none of these protein interactions a distinct function has been described yet. Recently, we cloned and characterized KIF1C, a member of the KIF1/Unc104 subfamily (21Dorner C. Ciossek T. Muller S. Moller P.H. Ullrich A. Lammers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20267-20275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). KIF1C is involved in the vesicle transport between the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum. At present, details on the vesicle binding mechanism and regulation of KIF1C or the other members of the KIF1/Unc104 subfamily are not known. Since the kinesin light chain proteins associate with the carboxyl terminus of kinesin and this seems to be the region that generally mediates association of kinesins with their cargo, we wanted to identify proteins that bind to the carboxyl terminus of KIF1C. By using the carboxyl-terminal 350 amino acids of KIF1C as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, we isolated different 14-3-3 isoforms from human skeletal muscle and brain cDNA libraries. The association of KIF1C with 14-3-3γ was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation in native human and murine fibroblasts and myoblasts and the 14-3-3γ-binding site identified. Furthermore, we have shown that in contrast to the related proteins KIF1A and KIF1B, the carboxyl terminus of KIF1C mediates the formation of KIF1C dimers. The carboxyl terminus of KIF1C (amino acids 755–1103) was cloned into the LexA fusion protein vector pBTM116 (kindly provided by S. Hollenberg and J. Cooper) and transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain L40 (MATa trp1 leu2 his3 LYS2::lexA-HIS3 URA3::lexA-lacZ) generating the L40 lexA-KIF1CCT strain. A human skeletal muscle cDNA library fused to the GAL4 activation domain in the pGAD10 vector and a human brain cDNA library cloned into the similar pACT2 vector (CLONTECH) were transformed into the L40 lexA-KIF1CCT strain, and 5 × 106transformants were screened for interaction as described by Hollenberget al. (22Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Yeast plasmid DNA was isolated from His+ β-galactosidase+ colonies, rescued intoEscherichia coli HB101, retransformed into L40 lexA-KIF1CCT, and assayed for β-galactosidase activity and growth on dropout medium with complete supplement lacking Trp, Leu, Ura, Lys, and His (Bio 101). The specificity of the interaction between the carboxyl terminus of KIF1C and potential candidates was proven by transforming the candidate plasmid also into the L40 LexA and the L40 LexA-laminin strain. The KIF1C rabbit polyclonal antiserum was raised against a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein of KIF1C (amino acids 362–725) and has been described earlier (21Dorner C. Ciossek T. Muller S. Moller P.H. Ullrich A. Lammers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20267-20275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The antiserum against GST was produced by immunizing rabbits with bacterially expressed GST protein. The antisera against the different 14-3-3 isoforms were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For transient expression in 293 cells, all cDNAs were cloned by standard procedures into the cytomegalovirus immediate early promotor-based expression plasmid pRK5 (23Lammers R. Bossenmaier B.

The GST-KIF1C construct contains the GST of the pGEX1vector cut with the restriction endonucleasesHincII and BamHI and cloned in frame to a sequence coding for the hemagglutinin peptide followed by the open reading frame of the KIF1C-cDNA. The amino-terminal deletion mutant of KIF1C, KIF1C-ΔNT570, contained the amino acids 570–1103, and the carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants KIF1C-ΔCT622, KIF1C-ΔCT802, and KIF1C-ΔCT1042 contained the amino acids 1–622, 1–802, and 1–1042, respectively. For generation of the KIF1C-SA mutant, the codon of serine 1092 was mutated to a codon for alanine using the method of Kunkel et al. (24Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). NIH3T3, RD, and C2C12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 2 mm glutamine. 293 cells were maintained in F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine. The inhibitor of protein kinase CKII 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB, Biomol) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and used at a concentration of 30 μm.

Briefly, the cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer/10-cm plate (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and the lysates were precleared by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The lysates were adjusted for equal protein concentration; the appropriate antibody (2 μl of serum or 0.2–2 μg of antibody) and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added, and the lysate was incubated for at least 3 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed with HNTG buffer (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate), separated on a 7.5, 8, or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and incubated with the appropriate antibody. Bound antibodies were visualized using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in conjunction with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat α-mouse or goat α-rabbit antibodies (Sigma). For in vitro binding assays, 293 cells transiently expressing KIF1C were lysed and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with GST or the GST-14-3-3γ fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose. After washing with HNTG, the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot. The GST-14-3-3γ fusion protein was purified by standard procedures fromE. coli transformed with a pGEX1–14-3-3γ plasmid. Immunoprecipitated KIF1C and KIF1C-SA from transfected 293 cells were dephosphorylated by calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (10 units, 45 min room temperature and 2 h at 4 °C). After washing the precipitate with PHEM (50 mmHEPES, 50 mm PIPES, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmMgCl2) the beads were resuspended in PHEM and distributed into 6 aliquots. One aliquot was used to determine the KIF1C protein concentration by Western blotting and KIF1C immunodetection; 4 aliquots were incubated with 250 μm Mg-ATP, 10 μCi of γ-[32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 1000 units of CKII (Biomol), and 1× CKII buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2) in a total volume of 20 μl (26Karki S. Tokito M.K. Holzbaur E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5887-5891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). An additional tube containing no CKII was included to serve as a control. Reactions were terminated by addition of Laemmli buffer and subsequent boiling. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the dried gel was exposed to x-ray film. The extent of phosphate incorporation was calculated by densitometric analysis of the x-ray film using the software Scion Image, version 2b. Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a 30–50-μl aliquot of the lysate was treated for 2 h at 4 °C with the cross-linking reagents. 1,5-Difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DFDNB, Pierce) was dissolved in acetone and used at a concentration of 1 mm. Cross-linking with disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS, Pierce) was performed at identical conditions except that the reagent was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and used at concentrations of 0,5 mm. The reactions were terminated by adding Tris buffer, pH 7.5, to a final concentration of 50 mm Tris. To identify proteins that associate with the carboxyl terminus of KIF1C, we employed the yeast two-hybrid system. The carboxyl-terminal amino acids 755–1103 were fused in frame to the DNA-binding domain of LexA (pBTM116) and used to screen a human skeletal muscle cDNA library subcloned into the GAL4 transcription activation domain expression vector pGAD10 and a human brain cDNA library subcloned into the similar pACT2 vector (CLONTECH). Approximately 5 × 106transformants were screened for expression of the reporter genesHIS3 and LacZ, and five different types of clones were found to interact specifically with KIF1C. Four types of clones represented members of the 14-3-3 family of proteins (see below), and one type encoded a peptide consisting of the carboxyl-terminal amino acids 814–1103 of KIF1C. This result was rather unexpected since the KLPs of the KIF1/Unc104 subfamily have been described as monomers (4Nangaku M. Sato-Yoshitake R. Okada Y. Noda Y. Takemura R. Yamazaki H. Hirokawa N. Cell. 1994; 79: 1209-1220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar,8Okada Y. Yamazaki H. Sekine-Aizawa Y. Hirokawa N. Cell. 1995; 81: 769-780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). To investigate the dimerization of KIF1C in intact cells, we first applied coimmunoprecipitation analysis. We constructed a fusion protein between GST and KIF1C that differs in size from wild-type KIF1C by 26 kDa and thus allows a separation of GST-KIF1C and KIF1C by SDS-PAGE. Coexpression of KIF1C and GST-KIF1C in 293 cells resulted in the formation of a dimer between these two proteins. As shown in Fig.1, immunoprecipitation using the αGST antibody, which did not react with KIF1C, resulted in a coprecipitation of KIF1C with GST-KIF1C. Since both proteins were detected by Western blot analysis using the αKIF1C antibody, the amount of coprecipitated KIF1C almost equaled the amount of the immunoprecipitated GST-KIF1C. These data demonstrate that under the conditions of transient overexpression, the full-length KIF1C proteins do form dimers with GST-KIF1C. Since a dimerization of endogenous KIF1C cannot be proven by coimmunoprecipitation, we tested two cross-linking reagents for their ability to react with KIF1C. We applied DSS and DFDNB, which differ in their reactivity against certain amino acids and their spanning distance. DSS is an amine-selective cross-linking reagent, which can span approximately 1.13 nm. The aryl halide DFDNB spans only over 0.3 nm but in addition to primary amines also reacts with thiol and phenolate groups as they occur in cysteine and tyrosine, respectively. Since our coimmunoprecipitation experiments clearly showed a dimerization of overexpressed KIF1C, we first applied the two reagents to lysates of 293 cells overexpressing KIF1C. As depicted in theright panel of Fig. 2, DFDNB generated an additional KIF1C-containing protein complex of approximately 270 kDa, which is twice the size of monomeric KIF1C. In these cells even more KIF1C protein was detected in the 270-kDa complex as was found as a monomer. Since under the conditions of transient overexpression it is unlikely that an endogenous protein of the cells with approximately the same size as KIF1C is expressed at these high levels, we conclude that the 270-kDa complex represents the KIF1C dimer. Interestingly, the DSS cross-linking reagent, although it can span more than three times the distance of DFDNB and is therefore considered to be less selective, reacted only weakly with KIF1C. This finding can only be explained by the structure of the KIF1C dimer in which not lysines but tyrosines and cysteines get in close contact to each other. We next applied the DSS and DFDNB reagents to lysates of untransfected 293 cells expressing only endogenous KIF1C. As shown in the left panel of Fig. 2, the lysate incubated with DFDNB contained a KIF1C protein complex of the same size as the KIF1C-overexpressing cells. DSS treatment did not result in any detectable complex formation of KIF1C supporting the idea that the 270-kDa protein complex consists of the same proteins as the one observed in the 293 cells transiently overexpressing KIF1C. In contrast to 293 cells overexpressing KIF1C, where most of the KIF1C is in the dimeric form, under physiological conditions only a small part of the KIF1C protein was detected as a dimer. We thus suggest that the dimer formation of KIF1C under physiological conditions is regulated, whereas the overexpressed proteins dimerize spontaneously. Dimerization between KLPs occurs by the formation of a coiled-coil structure that is formed by the carboxyl-terminal stalk region of the proteins (1Moore J.D. Endow S.A. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The probability of a sequence to form coiled coils can be predicted by the algorithm of Lupas (27Lupas A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 513-525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We analyzed the sequence of KIF1C, its closest relative KIF1B, and the dimeric KHC for the probability to form coiled-coils (Fig.3). KIF1C and KIF1B have only small areas that are predicted to form coiled-coils when compared with KHC. In KIF1C, four 40–60 amino acids containing regions around the amino acids 370, 450, 640, and 850 are highlighted by the algorithm. These short stretches are also found in KIF1B. In the yeast two-hybrid system the dimerizing KIF1C polypeptides included only the last of the 4 predicted coiled-coil elements. Therefore, even the small stretch of coiled coil formation seems to be sufficient for dimerization of KIF1C in yeast and may also mediate the dimer formation of KIF1C in mammalian cells. The additional clones that were found interacting with the carboxyl-terminal part of KIF1C coded for the proteins β, γ, ε, and ζ of the 14-3-3 family. In our studies we concentrated on the 14-3-3γ isoform. To confirm the interaction of KIF1C with this 14-3-3 family protein, in vitro association studies were performed. The cDNA of 14-3-3γ was cloned into the pGEX1 vector, and the GST-14-3-3γ fusion protein was bacterially expressed and purified. We immobilized 0.5 μg of GST-14-3-3γ or as a control 0.5 μg of GST protein on glutathione-Sepharose and incubated it with 200 μl of lysate from 293 cells overexpressing KIF1C. As shown in Fig.4 A, KIF1C specifically associated with the GST-14-3-3γ fusion protein but not with GST. To prove the association of KIF1C and 14-3-3γ in intact cells, we transiently overexpressed KIF1C and 14-3-3γ in 293 cells and immunoprecipitated either KIF1C or 14-3-3γ using the αKIF1C or α14-3-3γ antibodies, respectively. For specificity control of the antibodies, protein was also precipitated from lysates expressing only 14-3-3γ or KIF1C, respectively. After separation of the immunocomplex by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis, we could detect KIF1C in 14-3-3γ immunoprecipitates and also 14-3-3γ in KIF1C immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4 B). Interestingly, KIF1C was also coprecipitated from lysates of cells overexpressing only KIF1C but not 14-3-3γ. In these cells, the amount of endogenous 14-3-3γ was sufficient to associate with overexpressed KIF1C. Since less 14-3-3γ and consequently less KIF1C was precipitated from these cell lysates than from the lysate of cells overexpressing KIF1C and 14-3-3γ, the coprecipitation of KIF1C did not result from unspecific binding of KIF1C to the antibody but from an association of the overexpressed KIF1C with endogenous 14-3-3γ. These data suggested a high affinity of 14-3-3γ for KIF1C, and we therefore investigated the association between the two proteins in untransfected fibroblasts and skeletal muscle cells. After lysis of human 293 or mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts, we immunoprecipitated 14-3-3γ, separated the proteins by SDS-PAGE, and detected KIF1C and 14-3-3γ in the precipitates by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4 C). This association was also detected in the skeletal muscle C2C12 and rhabdomyosarcoma RD cell line (data not shown). To investigate whether the 14-3-3β, -ε, and -ζ isoforms also interact with KIF1C in intact cells, we constructed cDNAs that were expressed with a carboxyl-terminal Myc tag. Co-overexpression of KIF1C and these 14-3-3 proteins revealed that all isoforms associated with similar affinities with KIF1C (data not shown). These data thus clearly demonstrate an association between the motor protein KIF1C and the 14-3-3γ protein, and it is likely that the β, ε, and ζ isoforms act similarly. By using the amino acids 755–1103 as a bait in the yeast two-hybrid screen, we limited the 14-3-3γ interaction site of KIF1C to the carboxyl-terminal part of the protein. To locate the binding site more accurately and to exclude additional binding sites in KIF1C we coexpressed deletion mutants of KIF1C with 14-3-3γ in 293 cells. The deletion mutants of KIF1C were either the amino-terminal truncated protein, KIF1C-ΔNT570, or the different carboxyl-terminal truncated proteins KIF1C-ΔCT622, KIF1C-ΔCT802, and KIF1C-ΔCT1042. After lysis and immunoprecipitation with the α14-3-3γ and αKIF1C antibodies, we analyzed the immunocomplexes for coprecipitated KIF1C and 14-3-3γ, respectively. In KIF1C immunoprecipitates 14-3-3γ was only detected by Western blot analysis in cells that were expressing either the wild-type or the amino-terminal truncated KIF1C protein. Consequently, if 14-3-3γ was immunoprecipitated from these cell lysates, only wild-type KIF1C and KIF1C-ΔNT570coprecipitated (Fig. 5 A). From these data we confined the binding site of 14-3-3γ to KIF1C to the last 60 amino acids of the protein. Recently, the binding of 14-3-3 proteins to their ligands has been described to be dependent on a phosphorylated serine residue in the amino acid context of RRXRpS(p)XP (whereX indicates any amino acid; pS indicates phosphoserine (28Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar)). This sequence motif occurs also in the very carboxyl terminus of KIF1C and is located around the serine residue Ser1092(RRQRSAP). To test if this serine indeed is involved in 14-3-3 binding, we mutated Ser1092 to alanine so that the association of KIF1C with 14[ hyphen]3-3 proteins should be abolished. Immunoprecipitation of 14-3-3γ from lysates of 293 cells transiently expressing the KIF1C-SA mutant did not result in a coprecipitation of the KIF1C-SA (Fig. 5 B) although the protein was expressed (data not shown). This indicates that Ser1092 indeed is mediating the association between KIF1C and 14-3-3γ. Since the binding of 14-3-3 proteins normally depends on a phosphorylation of the serine residue, we tried to identify the responsible kinase. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of KIF1C identified Ser1092 as a potential substrate sequence for the protein kinase CKII. CKII can be inhibited by 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB), which was shown to be specific for CKII and does not inhibit other serine/threonine kinases like protein kinase A (29Zandomeni R. Zandomeni M.C. Shugar D. Weinmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3414-3419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Zandomeni R.O. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 469-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). If CKII indeed is involved in the phosphorylation of Ser1092, an incubation of cells with DRB should reduce its phosphorylation and thus diminish the association of KIF1C with 14-3-3γ. To test this hypothesis, 293 cells were either left untreated or incubated with 30 μm DRB for 18 h, lysed, and the 14-3-3γ protein immunoprecipitated. The immunocomplexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed for the presence of KIF1C. As shown in Fig.6, the amount of KIF1C coprecipitating with 14-3-3γ was strongly reduced in cells treated with the CKII inhibitor DRB. The reduction was dependent on the incubation time of the cells in the presence of DRB. In cells incubated for more than 16 h a significant reduction of KIF1C bound to 14-3-3γ was detected (data not shown), indicating that phosphorylation of Ser1092 is rather stable. These data show an involvement of CKII in the regulation of the association of KIF1C with 14-3-3γ and provide additional evidence for the specificity of the association of 14-3-3γ with KIF1C. To investigate if KIF1C is indeed a direct substrate of CKII or if the kinase CKII is regulating another kinase, which in turn then phosphorylates KIF1C, we performed an in vitro kinase assay with CKII. KIF1C and KIF1C-SA were expressed in 293 cells and purified by immunoprecipitation. To remove any phosphorylation that had occurred in 293 cells, the immunoprecipitates were incubated with alkaline phosphatase before starting the in vitro kinase assay. Then the immunoprecipitates were incubated with CKII in the presence of 25 μCi γ-[32P]ATP for different times as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To ensure that the observed phosphorylation represe"

J., and Fissel, B. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 8103–8110), and in the current study, we have evaluated the signaling pathway leading to this response. First, we inhibited endogenous Gαq/11 function by single-cell microinjection using anti-Gαq/11 antibody or RGS2 protein (a GTPase activating protein for Gαq) followed by immunostaining to quantitate GLUT4 translocation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. ET-1-stimulated GLUT4 translocation was markedly decreased by 70 or 75% by microinjection of Gαq/11 antibody or RGS2 protein, respectively. Pretreatment of cells with the Gαi inhibitor (pertussis toxin) or microinjection of a Gβγ inhibitor (glutathioneS-transferase-β-adrenergic receptor kinase (GST-BARK)) did not inhibit ET-1-induced GLUT4 translocation, indicating that Gαq/11 mediates ET-1 signaling to GLUT4 translocation. Next, we found that ET-1-induced GLUT4 translocation was inhibited by the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin or LY294002, but not by the phospholipase C inhibitor U-73122. ET-1 stimulated the PI 3-kinase activity of the p110α subunit (5.5-fold), and microinjection of anti-p110α or PKC-λ antibodies inhibited ET-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. Finally, we found that Gαq/11 formed immunocomplexes with the type-A endothelin receptor and the 110α subunit of PI 3-kinase and that ET-1 stimulation enhances tyrosine phosphorylation of Gαq/11. These results indicate that: 1) ET-1 signaling to GLUT4 translocation is dependent upon Gαq/11 and PI 3-kinase; and 2) Gαq/11 can transmit signals from the ETAreceptor to the p110α subunit of PI 3-kinase, as does insulin, subsequently leading to GLUT4 translocation. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) can stimulate insulin-responsive glucose transporter (GLUT4) translocation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Wu-Wong, J. R., Berg, C. E., Wang, J., Chiou, W. J., and Fissel, B. (1999) J.

https://openalex.org/W1974314313,"One of the hallmarks of human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) infection is the rapid removal of the viral receptor CD4 from the cell surface. This remarkably efficient receptor interference requires the activity of three separate viral proteins: Env, Vpu, and Nef. We have investigated whether this unusually tight interference on cell surface CD4 expression had a more essential function during the viral life cycle than simply preventing superinfection. We now report that the removal of cell surface CD4 is required for optimal virus production by HIV-1. Indeed, maintenance of CD4 surface expression in infected cells lead to a 3–5-fold decrease in viral particle production. This effect was not due to the formation of intracellular complexes between CD4 and the gp160 viral envelope precursor but instead required the presence of CD4 at the cell surface and was specifically mediated by CD4 but not closely related plasma membrane receptors. The finding that CD4 had no significant effect on particle release by a Vpu-deficient variant indicates that CD4 acts by inhibiting the particle release-promoting activity of Vpu. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments further showed that CD4 and Vpu physically interact at the cell surface, suggesting that CD4 might inhibit Vpu activity by disrupting its oligomeric structure. One of the hallmarks of human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) infection is the rapid removal of the viral receptor CD4 from the cell surface. This remarkably efficient receptor interference requires the activity of three separate viral proteins: Env, Vpu, and Nef. We have investigated whether this unusually tight interference on cell surface CD4 expression had a more essential function during the viral life cycle than simply preventing superinfection. We now report that the removal of cell surface CD4 is required for optimal virus production by HIV-1. Indeed, maintenance of CD4 surface expression in infected cells lead to a 3–5-fold decrease in viral particle production. This effect was not due to the formation of intracellular complexes between CD4 and the gp160 viral envelope precursor but instead required the presence of CD4 at the cell surface and was specifically mediated by CD4 but not closely related plasma membrane receptors. The finding that CD4 had no significant effect on particle release by a Vpu-deficient variant indicates that CD4 acts by inhibiting the particle release-promoting activity of Vpu. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments further showed that CD4 and Vpu physically interact at the cell surface, suggesting that CD4 might inhibit Vpu activity by disrupting its oligomeric structure. human immunodeficiency virus, type I endoplasmic reticulum polymerase chain reaction deoxycholate One of the common features of retroviral infection is the selective removal of the cellular receptor from the cell surface, resulting in resistance to superinfection by viruses using the same receptor (1Weiss R.A. Weiss R.A. Teich N.M. Varmus H.E. Coffin J. RNA Tumor Viruses. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1985: 209-260Google Scholar). The physiological significance of receptor down-regulation during the viral life cycle is still debated. There isin vitro evidence that viruses that fail to successfully inactivate their cellular receptor at the onset of infection display increased cytopathicity in the host. This correlates with massive reinfection leading to the accumulation of unintegrated viral DNA and cell death caused by toxic levels of viral protein expression and formation of syncytia (2Weller S.K. Joy A.E. Temin H.M. J. Virol. 1980; 33: 494-506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Donahue P.R. Quackenbush S.L. Gallo M.V. deNoronha C.M. Overbaugh J. Hoover E.A. Mullins J.I. J.

This suggests that the establishment of superinfection immunity is a key event involved in establishing a long term chronic rather than acute lytic infection. However, these data are not fully supported by in vivo evidence. Indeed, although it was reported that Friend leukemia virus can successfully establish a state of superinfection immunity in mice (7Mitchell T. Risser R. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5696-5702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), other in vivostudies have shown that cells chronically infected by the human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1)1 can maintain expression of the CD4 receptor (8Psallidopoulos M.C.

Baseler M. Massari F. Fox C.H. Salzman N.P. Fauci A.S. Science. 1989; 245: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). This leaves open the question of the exact role and importance of receptor interference in the HIV-1 life cycle. For a majority of retroviruses, receptor interference is a direct consequence of high affinity interactions between the viral envelope glycoprotein and the cellular receptor (reviewed in Ref. 10Bour S. Geleziunas R. Wainberg M.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 63-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such interactions can take place intracellularly and lead to the sequestration of the cellular receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of cells (11Delwart E.L. Panganiban A.T. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 273-280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, soluble forms of the viral envelope protein secreted from infected cells can interact with the cellular receptor at the cell surface resulting in the masking of the viral binding site (7Mitchell T. Risser R. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5696-5702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HIV-1 is unique among retroviruses in that it uses, aside from the function of receptor-Env complexes, two additional mechanisms to down-regulate cell surface expression of its cellular receptor. Indeed, both the nef and vpu genes encode activities that contribute to the down-modulation of cell surface CD4 (for review, see Ref. 10Bour S. Geleziunas R. Wainberg M.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 63-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Early in the viral life cycle, the Nef protein mediates the accelerated internalization and lysosomal degradation of cell surface CD4 by targeting it to an endocytic pathway involving clathrin-coated pits (for recent reviews, see Refs. 12Strebel K. Bour S. AIDS J. 1999; 13: S13-S24Google Scholar and13Oldridge J. Marsh M. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 302-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In later phases of the viral life cycle, the gp160 envelope glycoprotein precursor as well as the Vpu protein further contribute to a complete down-regulation of cell surface CD4 (5Stevenson M. Meier C. Mann A.M. Chapman N. Wasiak A. Cell. 1988; 53: 483-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 14Willey R.L. Maldarelli F. Martin M.A. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7193-7200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). gp160 is a major factor in CD4 down-modulation that can, in most instances, quantitatively block the bulk of newly synthesized CD4 in the endoplasmic reticulum (15Crise B. Buonocore L. Rose J.K. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5585-5593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Jabbar M.A. Nayak D.P. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 6297-6304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Bour S. Boulerice F. Wainberg M.A. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6387-6396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hart A.R. Cloyd M.W. Virology. 1990; 177: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This strategy has, however, an important shortcoming. Indeed, the formation of CD4-gp160 complexes in the ER blocks the transport and maturation of not only CD4 but of the envelope protein as well (17Bour S. Boulerice F. Wainberg M.A. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6387-6396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, if the levels of CD4 in the ER exceed those of gp160, Env trafficking to the cell surface and incorporation into virions are effectively blocked, resulting in production of noninfectious virus devoid of envelope protein (19Buonocore L. Rose J.K. Nature. 1990; 345: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar,20Lama J. Mangasarian A. Trono D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 622-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). One of the well characterized functions of Vpu is to induce the degradation of CD4 molecules trapped in intracellular complexes with Env, thus releasing gp160 for transport toward the cell surface (21Willey R.L. Maldarelli F. Martin M.A. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 226-234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Vpu-mediated degradation of CD4 requires direct interactions between the cytoplasmic tails of the two molecules (22Bour S. Schubert U. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1510-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is dependent on the presence of two phosphorylated serine residues at positions 52 and 56 in the Vpu cytoplasmic domain (23Schubert U. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2260-2271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the phosphoserine residues do not participate in CD4-Vpu interactions (22Bour S. Schubert U. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1510-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They rather serve to link Vpu-targeted CD4 to the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation machinery by providing a binding site for the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex component βTrCP (24Margottin F. Bour S.P. Durand H. Selig L. Benichou S. Richard V. Thomas D. Strebel K. Benarous R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 565-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). In addition to its destabilizing effect on CD4, Vpu is known to mediate the efficient release of viral particles from HIV-1-infected cells (25Klimkait T. Strebel K. Hoggan M.D. Martin M.A. Orenstein J.M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 621-629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Strebel K. Klimkait T. Maldarelli F. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3784-3791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This function of Vpu relies on the integrity of its transmembrane domain as well as the ability of Vpu to form homo-oligomeric complexes in a post-ER compartment (27Paul M. Mazumder S. Raja N. Jabbar M.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Moore P.B. Zhong Q. Husslein T. Klein M.L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 29Schubert U. Bour S. Ferrer-Montiel A.V. Montal M. Maldarelli F. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 809-819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the cytoplasmic domain of Vpu is necessary and sufficient to mediate CD4 degradation in the ER (22Bour S. Schubert U. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1510-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Lenburg M.E. Landau N.R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7238-7245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Willey R.L. Buckler-White A. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1207-1212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given these mechanistic and structural differences the question arises as to why such apparently unrelated activities have evolved within the Vpu protein. The present work examines the physiological relevance of receptor down-modulation by HIV-1. By using a model system where cell surface CD4 was maintained despite the interfering activities of HIV-1, we were able to show that cell surface CD4 exerts a profound inhibitory effect on HIV particle production. We further identified the mechanism of CD4 action by showing that it directly interfered with the ability of Vpu to promote viral particle release, presumably by disrupting the oligomeric structure of Vpu. These data provide new insights into the physiological relevance of receptor interference and suggest that the inhibitory activity of CD4 on an essential step of the viral life cycle likely participated in the selection of three separate receptor interference factors in HIV-1. Our data also present for the first time a functional link between the two mechanistically independent activities of Vpu: namely, Vpu-mediated degradation of CD4 participates in the particle release function of Vpu by reducing the levels of inhibitory cell surface CD4. pNL4-3 is a full-length infectious molecular clone that expresses all HIV-1 proteins (32Adachi A. Gendelman H.E. Koenig S. Folks T. Willey R. Rabson A. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1986; 59: 284-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pNL43/Udel is a Vpu-deficient variant bearing a 41-base pair out-of-frame deletion in the vpu gene (25Klimkait T. Strebel K. Hoggan M.D. Martin M.A. Orenstein J.M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 621-629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pNL43-K1 is anenv-deficient variant of pNL4-3 (33Bour S. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8285-8300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pNL-A1 and pNL-A1/Udel are derivatives of a vif cDNA clone and express all HIV-1 proteins except Gag and Pol (26Strebel K. Klimkait T. Maldarelli F. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3784-3791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A phosphorylation mutant of Vpu, Vpu26, was expressed from pNL-A1/U26 (23Schubert U. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2260-2271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pHIV-CD4ΔBam, expressing full-length CD4; pHIV-CD4/Q421 encoding an ER retention variant of CD4; and pHIV-CD4/Nar bearing a C-terminal 22-residue deletion in the CD4 cytoplasmic tail were described previously (14Willey R.L. Maldarelli F. Martin M.A. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7193-7200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Bour S. Schubert U. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1510-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A CD4-deficient variant of pHIV-CD4ΔBam, pHIV-CD4(−), was constructed by digestion with MfeI followed by fill-in of the 5′ overhangs with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. Self-ligation of the modified vector introduced a frameshift in the CD4 ORF that truncates the molecule to the 130 N-terminal residues (approximately half of the ectodomain). pHIV-CD8 expresses the full-length CD8 molecule under the control of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat. The construct was generated by subcloning a 1.5-kilobase EcoRI fragment from pT8F1 (obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program) into the BssHII-XhoI sites of pNL4-3. pHIV-CD8/4 encodes a chimeric molecule bearing the CD8 ectodomain fused to the CD4 transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail. This construct was obtained by cloning a 1968-base pair BssHII-XhoI fragment from the previously described pCMV-CD8/4 plasmid (31Willey R.L. Buckler-White A. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1207-1212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) into pHIV-CD8. pHIV-CD4/8 and pHIV-CD4/3 encode chimeric proteins bearing the CD4 ectodomain and CD8 or CD3 transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail, respectively. The chimeric open reading frame was constructed by using a two-step PCR strategy as follows. In a first step, two PCR fragments overlapping at the chimera junction were generated using pHIV-CD4 and pHIV-CD8 or pXS-CD3γ (a generous gift from Dr. David L. Wiest, The Fox Chase Cancer Center), respectively. The two PCR fragments were purified, mixed, and allowed to hybridize in a second round of PCR designed to amplify the joined fragments. The product of the second round of PCR was digested with MfeI and AgeI restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and cloned into the corresponding sites in pHIV-CD4ΔBam. All pHIV constructs are under the transcriptional control of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat and therefore require the presence of the HIV-1 Tat transactivator. This conditional expression system ensures that in co-transfection experiments CD4 and CD4-derived chimeras are expressed only in cells also expressing HIV-1 proteins. HeLa-T4 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/5% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 1 mg/ml G418. HeLa or HeLa-T4 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method as described (34Bour S. Schubert U. Peden K. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 820-829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 106 HeLa cells were incubated for 4 h with 20–30 μg of calcium phosphate-precipitated plasmid DNA, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and subjected to a 2.5-min glycerol shock. Cells were maintained in 5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/fetal calf serum for 16 h prior to metabolic labeling or lysate preparation. The TP human serum reacts against all major HIV-1 proteins and was obtained from an asymptomatic HIV-seropositive patient. A rabbit polyclonal antiserum directed against the cytoplasmic tail of Vpu (U2-3) was used for Western blot hybridization (35Maldarelli F. Chen M.Y. Willey R.L. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5056-5061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The T4-4 rabbit polyclonal antibody, directed against the ectodomain of CD4, was obtained from the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program and was originally contributed by Dr. R. Sweet (36Deen K.C. McDougal J.S. Inacker R. Folena-Wasserman G. Arthos J. Rosenberg J. Maddon P.J. Axel R. Sweet R.W. Nature. 1988; 331: 82-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The T4-Cy polyclonal antibody is directed against the cytoplasmic tail of the CD4 molecule and was generated by immunization of rabbits with a synthetic peptide representing residues 394–422 of CD4 coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Measurement of HIV viral particle release efficiency was performed as described previously (33Bour S. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8285-8300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were pulse labeled for 30 min with 1 mCi/ml [35S]methionine and chased at 37 °C for up to 4 h. Aliquots of the cells and culture medium cleared of cell debris harvested at each time point were lysed by freeze-thaw in Nonidet P-40-DOC lysis buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% deoxycholate (DOC). Viral proteins were recovered by immunoprecipitation with TP serum and protein A-agarose beads and separated on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels. HIV Gag proteins detected in the cell and supernatant fractions were quantified with a Fuji FLA2000 phosphoimager, and the particle release efficiency at each time point was calculated as the ratio of Gag proteins in the medium fraction over the total amount of Gag proteins present in the cell and medium fractions. Cells were washed with 5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and surface biotinylated with 1 ml of Sulfo-NHS Biotin (Pierce) at 0.25 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by freeze-thaw in either Nonidet P-40-DOC buffer for analysis of CD4 surface expression or digitonin lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% digitonin) (22Bour S. Schubert U. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1510-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for analysis of CD4-Vpu interactions. Biotinylated proteins were recovered from the lysate by immunoprecipitation with Neutravidin-agarose beads (Pierce). Proteins separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were transferred to Immobilon membranes, blocked with 5% skim milk, and probed with the indicated antisera at 1:1500 dilution. Proteins were revealed by chemoluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a 1:4000 dilution of an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antiserum (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bands were quantified on a Macintosh computer using the public domain NIH Image program (developed at the U. S. National Institutes of Health). We first tested the effect of CD4 on viral particle release in HeLa-T4 cells expressing the human CD4 in a stable and constitutive manner (37Maddon P.J. Dalgleish A.G. McDougal J.S. Clapham P.R. Weiss R.A. Axel R. Cell. 1986; 47: 333-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar). HeLa and HeLa-T4 cells were transfected with plasmid expressing either the NL4-3 molecular clone or its Vpu-deficient counterpart, NL4-3/Udel. 24 h post-transfection, the cell and supernatant fractions were separated, and viral particles secreted in the culture medium were recovered by centrifugation. Viral lysates obtained from each fraction were loaded onto polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed in Western blot using an HIV-positive human serum (data not shown). Viral proteins corresponding to the pr55 gag and p24 capsid components were quantified, and the efficiency of particle release was calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The result of a representative experiment shows that, in normal HeLa cells, the presence of Vpu enhanced viral particle release more than 3-fold (Fig. 1). In contrast, the rate of particle release of wild-type NL4-3 in HeLa-T4 cells was dramatically reduced and comparable with that observed for the Vpu-deficient (NL4-3/Udel) virus in HeLa cells, suggesting that CD4 exerts a negative effect on viral production. In addition, the particle release activity of the Vpu-deficient NL4-3/Udel was similar in HeLa and HeLa-T4 cells (Fig. 1), suggesting that the inhibitory effect of CD4 likely targets the particle release activity of Vpu. To determine whether the low level of virus release observed in HeLa-T4 cells was indeed the result of impaired Vpu activity, we performed a detailed pulse/chase analysis of viral particle release. For that purpose, HeLa cells transfected with pNL4-3 in the presence or absence of the CD4 expression vector pHIV-CD4ΔBam were labeled for 30 min and chased for up to 4 h. Aliquots of the cell and virus fractions harvested at the indicated chase times were immunoprecipitated with an HIV-positive patient serum and separated on polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 2 A). As a control, virus release by the Vpu-deficient pNL4-3/Udel variant was determined in parallel. As previously reported, the absence of Vpu led to a significant reduction in the amounts of virus-associated p24 capsid protein released in the supernatant over time (Fig.2 A, compare NL4-3 and NL4-3/Udel). This was accompanied by a characteristic intracellular accumulation of Gag proteins but no apparent effect on the kinetics of the pr55 gag and gp160 Env precursor cleavage. In the presence of CD4, the amount of p24 in the supernatant was reduced as compared with NL4-3 alone, although no differences in the kinetics of Gag maturation were observed (Fig. 2 A, NL4-3 + CD4). This correlated with accumulation of p24 in the cell fraction, similar to that observed for NL4-3/Udel. Bands corresponding to pr55 gag and p24 in Fig. 2 A were quantified, and particle release efficiency was calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures” and plotted as a function of the chase time (Fig.2 B). In agreement with previous studies (33Bour S. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8285-8300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), more than 40% of Gag proteins synthesized by NL4-3 were released as viral particles within the 4 h of chase (Fig. 2 B, NL4-3). In the presence of CD4, however, the particle release of NL4-3 dropped 4-fold (Fig. 2 B, NL4-3 + CD4) to levels similar to that of the Vpu-deficient variant (Fig. 2 B,NL4-3/Udel). Together with the fact that CD4 did not perturb the maturation kinetics of Gag proteins (Fig. 2 A), these data suggest that CD4 directly or indirectly interferes with the activity of Vpu. Moreover, CD4 had a similar negative effect on particle release in HeLa cells whether transiently expressed by transfection (Fig. 2) or stably expressed (Fig. 1). This indicates that the effect observed in HeLa-T4 cells was due to CD4 rather than cellular factors specific to that cell line. Interestingly, no mature gp120 envelope protein was detected in the presence of CD4 (Fig.2 A, compare NL4-3 and NL4-3 + CD4). This confirms previous data showing that formation of intracellular complexes between CD4 and gp160 blocks the latter in the ER and therefore prevents access of gp160 to the Golgi compartment where it is normally cleaved into the mature gp120 and gp41 components (17Bour S. Boulerice F. Wainberg M.A. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6387-6396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Buonocore L. Rose J.K. Nature. 1990; 345: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The fact that gp160 maturation was quantitatively impaired indicates that CD4 was expressed at a molar excess relative to gp160, and it is thus likely that, under these experimental conditions, a fraction of CD4 was transported to the cell surface. To assess whether the inhibitory effect of CD4 on virus release correlates with its presence at the cell surface, HeLa cells were co-transfected with pNL4-3 and increasing amounts of pHIV-CD4ΔBam, as indicated in Fig.3. The total amount of CD4 as well as the fraction present at the cell surface were assayed on half of the transfected cells by Western blot (Fig. 3 A). Cells were surface biotinylated prior to lysis in Nonidet P-40-DOC buffer. A small fraction (10%) of each lysate was then removed for direct determination of total CD4. The remainder of each lysate was reacted with Neutravidin-agarose beads to isolate cell surface-associated biotinylated species. Both fractions were subsequently separated on acrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed in Western blot with a mixture of the T4-4 and T4-Cy anti-CD4 polyclonal antibodies. Significant amounts of total CD4 were detected with as little as 2 μg of transfected CD4 plasmid DNA. However, under the experimental conditions used here, i.e. in the presence of Env, Vpu, and Nef, at least 8 μg of pHIV-CD4 were required to detect CD4 at the cell surface (Fig. 3 A). Further increasing the amount of transfected plasmid DNA led to a proportional increase in CD4 cell surface expression (Fig. 3 A). The second half of transfected cells was used to determine the efficiency of NL4-3 particle release by pulse-chase. Cells were labeled for 30 min and chased for 4 h. At both time points, equal aliquots of the cells were lysed, and the virus secreted in the medium was recovered by centrifugation. Radiolabeled viral proteins were immunoprecipitated with TP serum and separated on polyacrylamide gels (data not shown). Bands corresponding to Gag proteins were quantified, and the particle release efficiency was calculated at the 4-h time point and plotted in Fig. 3 B. The data show a linear correlation between the amounts of CD4 at the cell surface and the decrease in viral particle production (Fig. 3 B). Interestingly, in the presence of 15 μg of transfected pHIV-CD4 plasmid, the particle release efficiency of wild-type NL4-3 was similar to that observed for the Vpu-deficient variant (compare Fig. 1,NL-43/Udel, and Fig. 3 B). This indicates that at these levels, cell surface CD4 is able to fully inhibit the activity of Vpu on particle release. This phenomenon required the presence of CD4 at the cell surface because no inhibition of particle release was observed upon transfection of 4 μg of pHIV-CD4, despite the presence of significant amounts of total CD4. Results from Fig. 3 reveal an intriguing correlation between the levels of cell surface CD4 and the degree of inhibition of virus release. This suggests that the subcellular localization of CD4 rather than its steady-state level is relevant to this mechanism. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect on virus release of a CD4 mutant (CD4/Q421) bearing an ER retention signal. The experiment was performed as described for Fig. 3, and the levels of total and cell surface CD4 were determined by Western blot. As shown in Fig.4 A, intracellular expression levels of CD4 and CD4/Q421 were similar when equivalent amounts of plasmid were transferred. In contrast, cell surface expression of the CD4/Q421 mutant was markedly impaired relative to wild-type CD4. Despite the high intracellular levels of CD4/Q421, the effect of the retention mutant on NL4-3 particle release was minimal, indicating that CD4 exerts its inhibitory action from a post-ER compartment (Fig.4 B). These data also indicate that the effect of CD4 is not due to nonspecific toxicity generated by overexpression of CD4 in cells. At the highest concentrations of CD4/Q421 a moderate 25% inhibition of particle release was observed (Fig. 4 B), because of a small fraction of CD4/Q421 escaping the ER retention (Fig.4 A). The inhibition of gp160 cleavage concomitant with decreased virus production observed in Fig. 2 suggests that intracellular interactions between CD4 and gp160 might play a role in the negative effect of CD4 on particle release. We therefore addressed the role of the HIV-1 envelope protein in this process. The effect of CD4 on particle release by an Env-deficient variant of NL4-3, NL43-K1, was assessed in a CD4 dose-response experiment similar to that detailed in Fig. 3. Cell surface CD4 detected by surface biotinylation appeared at significantly lower concentrations of pHIV-CD4ΔBam plasmid as was observed in the case of NL4-3 (compare Figs. 3 A and5 A). This was expected because the envelope protein is a major component of CD4 down-regulation and is absent in NL43-K1. Accordingly, inhibition of viral particle release was observed at lower concentrations of CD4 with 24% inhibition obtained with as little as 2 μg of transfected pHIV-CD4 DNA. In the presence of 12 μg of CD4 plasmid, the inhibition reached a maximal value of 69% of the NL4-3 control, a level similar to that of a Vpu(−) virus (compare Fig. 1, NL4-3/Udel, and Fig. 5). Further increasing the amount of CD4 present at the cell surface had little additional effect on particle release, indicating that once Vpu activity is fully inhibited, no other mechanism is in place to further reduce particle release (Fig. 5, 15 μg of pHIV-CD4). These data indicate that the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein is not required for the inhibitory effect CD4 exerts on virus production by HIV-1. O"

We have expressed the separate lipoxygenase and allene oxide synthase (AOS) domains of the coral protein in Escherichia coli (BL21 cells) and purified the proteins; this system gives high expression (1.5 and 0.3 μmol/liter, respectively) of catalytically active enzymes. Both domains show fast reaction kinetics. Catalytic activity of the lipoxygenase domain is stimulated 5-fold by high concentrations of monovalent cations (500 mmNa+, Li+, or K+), and an additional 5-fold by 10 mm Ca2+. The resulting rates of reaction are ≈300 turnovers/s, 1–2 orders of magnitude faster than mammalian lipoxygenases. This makes the coral lipoxygenase well suited for partnership with the AOS domain, which shows maximum rates of ≈1400 turnovers/s in the conversion of 8R-HPETE to the allene oxide. Some unusual catalytic activities of the two domains are described. The lipoxygenase domain converts 20.3ω6 partly to the bis-allylic hydroperoxide (10-hydroperoxyeicosa-8,11,14-trienoic acid). Metabolism of the preferred substrate of the AOS domain, 8R-HPETE, is inhibited by the enantiomer 8S-HPETE. Although the AOS domain has homology to catalase in primary structure, it is completely lacking in catalatic action on H2O2; catalase itself, as expected from its preference for small hydroperoxides, is ineffective in allene oxide synthesis from 8R-HPETE.

Adv. Prostaglandin Thromboxane Leukotriene Res. 1985; 14: 229-262PubMed Google Scholar). In the early 1970s, at a time when practical chemical syntheses of the prostaglandins were still under development,P. homomalla was used as a commercial source of these mammalian hormones. This practical interest led in turn to investigation of the coral prostaglandin synthase. The issue of the biochemical pathway turned out to be difficult to tackle in P. homomalla itself, because, for reasons that remain unclear, prostaglandin synthesis is not observed in in vitropreparations of this particular coral (2Brash A.R. Baertschi S.W. Ingram C.D. Harris T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15829-15839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using another species, the Arctic coral Gersemia fruticosa, a body of evidence indicates an endoperoxide pathway akin to the mammalian cyclooxygenase route (3Varvas K. Koljak R. Järving I. Pehk T. Samel N. Tetrahedron Lett. 1994; 35: 8267-8270Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 4Varvas K. Järving I. Koljak R. Valmsen K. Brash A.R. Samel N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9923-9929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although it has proved difficult to detect prostaglandin synthesis using in vitro preparations of P. homomalla, the metabolism of added arachidonic acid is readily observed (2Brash A.R. Baertschi S.W. Ingram C.D. Harris T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15829-15839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Corey E.J. Matsuda S.P.T. Nagata R. Cleaver M.B. Tetrahedron Lett. 1988; 29: 2555-2558Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). There is very high 8R-lipoxygenase activity, sufficient to consume perhaps 1 mm arachidonic acid in a 1:10 tissue/buffer homogenate. At least two distinct lipoxygenases account for this activity. One is a predominantly soluble enzyme, essentially a typical lipoxygenase in terms of catalytic properties, primary structure, and molecular weight (6Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Chang M.S. Shieh B.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20949-20957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The second enzyme, the subject of the present investigation, is unique among reported lipoxygenases in that it occurs as a natural fusion protein with an extra 43-kDa N-terminal domain that functions as an allene oxide synthase (7Koljak R. Boutaud O. Shieh B.-H. Samel N. Brash A.R. Science. 1997; 277: 1994-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Allene oxides are unstable epoxides formed from lipoxygenase-derived fatty acid hydroperoxides. Biosynthesis has been detected in both plants and marine invertebrates (8Hamberg M. J. Am. Oil Chem. Soc. 1989; 66: 1445-1449Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 9Song W.-C. Brash A.R. Bailey J.M. Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes, Lipoxins and PAF. Plenum Press, New York1991: 89-96Crossref Google Scholar). Allene oxides can cyclize to form five-membered carbon rings, and initially this was suspected to be part of the coral route to the prostaglandins (2Brash A.R. Baertschi S.W. Ingram C.D. Harris T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15829-15839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Corey E.J. Matsuda S.P.T. Nagata R. Cleaver M.B. Tetrahedron Lett. 1988; 29: 2555-2558Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In plants, the enzymatic cyclization of an allene oxide derived from 13-hydroperoxylinolenic acid is established as a step in biosynthesis of the cyclopentanone hormone, jasmonic acid (10Hamberg M. Gardner H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1165: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Although the allene oxide pathway has not been substantiated for prostaglandin synthesis in coral, it may constitute the route to other prostanoid-related products such as the clavulones and punaglandins of other corals (5Corey E.J. Matsuda S.P.T. Nagata R. Cleaver M.B. Tetrahedron Lett. 1988; 29: 2555-2558Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 11Corey E.J. Lansbury P.T.J. Yamada Y.

There is also the implication of other as yet undefined roles for allene oxides. In starfish oocytes, for example, allene oxide synthesis occurs in the absence of enzymatic cyclization of the epoxide (13Brash A.R. Hughes M.A. Hawkins D.J. Boeglin W.E. Song W.-C. Meijer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22926-22931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this also appears to be the case in P. homomalla (2Brash A.R. Baertschi S.W. Ingram C.D. Harris T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15829-15839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme involved in allene oxide synthesis in plants is a member of the cytochrome P450 family of hemoproteins and is designated as CYP74A (14Song W.-C. Funk C.D. Brash A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8519-8523Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In contrast to the typical P450 monooxygenase, this allene oxide synthase (AOS)1 does not require molecular oxygen or reducing equivalents from NADPH. The ferric form of the hemoprotein converts the 13S-hydroperoxides of linoleic and linolenic acids to the corresponding allene oxides with a turnover number of ≈1000/s (15Song W.-C. Brash A.R. Science. 1991; 253: 781-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The plant AOS is closely related to the aldehyde-forming hydroperoxide lyase, another plant cytochrome P450 specialized for the metabolism of fatty acid hydroperoxides (16Matsui K. Shibutani M. Hase T. Kajiwara T. FEBS Lett. 1996; 394: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The plant and coral AOS enzymes catalyze reactions with identical chemistry. It was unexpected, therefore, when cloning of the second lipoxygenase from P. homomalla led to characterization of a novel type of allene oxide synthase unrelated to the cytochrome P450 s (7Koljak R. Boutaud O. Shieh B.-H. Samel N. Brash A.R. Science. 1997; 277: 1994-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The cDNA of the lipoxygenase-related transcript encoded a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 122 kDa. Sequencing revealed a C-terminal lipoxygenase domain of 79 kDa and a unique N-terminal domain of 43 kDa with some weak homology to catalase. Expression of the fusion protein and of the two separate domains established the 8R-lipoxygenase activity of the C-terminal 79 kDa and the AOS activity of the catalase-related N-terminal domain (7Koljak R. Boutaud O. Shieh B.-H. Samel N. Brash A.R. Science. 1997; 277: 1994-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The lipoxygenase forms a specific 8R-hydroperoxy fatty acid, the substrate of the AOS domain. A more detailed study of the two domains of this unique fusion protein is described here. Arachidonic acid was purchased from NuChek Prep Inc (Elysian, MN), and [1-14C]arachidonic acid from NEN Life Science Products. HPETE and HETE standards were prepared by vitamin E-controlled auto-oxidation (17Peers K.F. Coxon D.T. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1983; 32: 49-56Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and 8R-HPETE was synthesized using acetone powder extracts of P. homomalla(2Brash A.R. Baertschi S.W. Ingram C.D. Harris T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15829-15839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To prepare the AOS domain with a C-terminal His tag, the AOS domain was cloned into the pET3a vector with the 5′ sequence encoded as ATG GCT AGC ATG ACT GGT GGA CAG CAA ATG GGT CGC GGA TCC ACC ATG-, with the last codon being the start of the wild type enzyme. To ligate the 3′ end of the AOS domain into pET3a, the vector was cut at a uniqueClaI site. The 3′ end of the AOS sequence was modified by the addition of four histidines encoded after amino acid 373, followed by a stop codon and ClaI restriction site, -AAT CAT CAC CAT CAC TAA ATC GAT-, with the two last codons being the restriction site for ClaI; the stop codon was encoded as TAA and not TAG, because the enzyme ClaI isdam-sensitive, and it cannot cut when the restriction site is preceded by a G (as in TAG), in which case the first adenine of the restriction site would be methylated. The 8R-lipoxygenase domain was cloned into pET3a at the BamHI site and expressed with 14 amino acids from the vector (as above) followed by Met and a His4 tag (…ATG CAT CAC CAT CAC AAT GCT.. .. .), with the last two codons representing the start of the wild type lipoxgenase sequence. The two domains were expressed separately in BL21 cells using a modified expression methodology described by Hoffman et al. (18Hoffman B.J. Broadwater J.A. Johnson P. Harper J. Fox B.G. Kenealy W.R. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 646-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A typical preparation of a 50-ml culture was carried out as follows; 1 ml of LB medium containing 400 μg/ml ampicillin was inoculated with a single colony of AOS-His in BL21 cells and grown at 37 °C at 250 rpm for 4 h. An aliquot (200 μl) of this culture was used to inoculate 10 ml of fresh LB medium (with 400 μg/ml ampicillin) and re-grown for 3 h; the culture was then diluted with 40 ml of TB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and grown at 28 °C, 250 rpm for 24 h. The cells were spun down at 5000 rpm (≈6000 × g) for 10 min in a Sorvall RC-3 centrifuge, washed with 40 ml of 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.9, pelleted again at 5000 rpm for 10 min, and resuspended in 10 ml of TSE buffer (100 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.6, 500 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm EDTA) containing 1 mg/ml lysozyme and kept on ice for 30 min. The spheroplasts were then spun down at 5000 rpm for 15 min, resuspended in 10 ml of spheroplast buffer, and frozen at −80 °C. When aliquots were thawed (on ice), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added at a final concentration of 1 mm. The spheroplasts were then sonicated twice for 30 s using a model 50 Sonic Dismembrator (Fisher Scientific) at a setting of 2. The resulting membranes were spun down at 100,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C. AOS activity is present in the supernatant. The same procedure was used for the lipoxygenase domain, except that it was recovered in the 100,000 × g supernatant after solubilization using 0.2% Emulphogene BC-720TM (polyoxyethylene 10 tridecyl ether, Sigma). The histidine-tagged allene oxide synthase (His-AOS) was purified following the protocol of Imai et al. (19Imai T. Globerman H. Gertner J.M. Kagawa N. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 26: 19681-19689Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The 150,000 × gsupernatant was loaded on a nickel-NTA column (0.5 ml bed volume, Qiagen) equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 500 mm NaCl at 0.5 ml/min. The column was then washed with the equilibration buffer and the nonspecific bound proteins were eluted with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm glycine. The His-AOS was then eluted with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 500 mm NaCl, 40 mml-histidine. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and assayed for the AOS activity. The positive fractions were dialyzed overnight against 50 mm Tris·HCl buffer, pH 7.9, using a microdialyzer (Pierce). For the lipoxygenase purification, 0.2% Emulphogene BC-720TM was included throughout the procedure. The purity of the enzyme preparations was determined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Colorimetric protein assay using BCA reagent (Pierce) was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions using bovine serum albumin as a standard. For the spectrophotometric assay of AOS protein, the UV-visible spectrum was recorded between 200 and 700 nm and the protein concentration calculated from the absorbance at 280 nm using a molar extinction coefficient calculated from the protein sequence by the program Protean (DNASTAR Inc, Madison, WI). The heme concentration in the same fractions was determined by the pyridine hemochrome assay (20Dodge J.T. Mitchell C. Hanahan D.J. Arch. Biochem. 1963; 100: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3636) Google Scholar). About 2 nmol of enzyme was diluted to 1.5 ml with potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Then, 0.5 ml of pyridine and 0.25 ml of 1n NaOH was added quickly and mixed by vortex under a hood. The sample was divided in two cuvettes and the base line was recorded between 520 and 620 nm. A few grains of sodium dithionite were then added to the sample cuvette, and the spectrum was recorded immediately. The absorbance was measured at 557 and 575 nm, and the heme concentration was calculated from the absorbance difference 557–575 and using an extinction coefficient of 32,400 (20Dodge J.T. Mitchell C. Hanahan D.J. Arch. Biochem. 1963; 100: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3636) Google Scholar). These results gave a molar extinction coefficient for the 406-nm heme absorbance of 100,000. The lipoxygenase domain was quantified by colorimetric protein assay or from the protein band intensities of aliquots on a Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel in comparison to the band intensities of a series of albumin standards (0.25, 0.50, 1, and 2 μg) run on the same gel. Incubations of enzymes and substrates were carried out essentially as described previously (2Brash A.R. Baertschi S.W. Ingram C.D. Harris T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15829-15839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,6Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Chang M.S. Shieh B.-H. J. Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 250-259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using 50 or 100 μm substrate and typically in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, with additions of salts as described under “Results.” Unlabeled substrates were used for spectrophotometric assays (monitoring increase in UV absorbance at 235 nm); for structural analysis of products from C20 fatty acids, 14C-labeled 20.3ω6, 20.4ω6, or 20.5ω3 were included in the incubations. Products were extracted either using the Bligh and Dyer procedure (22Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43133) Google Scholar) or using methylene chloride. For complete recovery of the more polar products the aqueous phase was acidified to <pH 5 prior to extraction. To optimize recovery of acid-labile products from 20.3ω6, the pH of the solutions for extraction were kept higher than 5 and the organic extract was washed with water (or Bligh and Dyer upper phase) prior to evaporation. Extracts were kept in methanol at −20 °C under argon prior to analysis. The AOS domain was assayed by following the decrease in absorbance at 235 nm of the substrate hydroperoxides using a Beckman DU-7 spectrophotometer essentially as described (21Brash A.R. Song W.-C. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 250-259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lipoxygenase activity was assayed using the increase in absorbance at 235 nm. Extracts were analyzed initially by RP-HPLC using a Beckman Ultrasphere ODS 5S or Waters Symmetry C18 columns (25 × 0.46 cm) with solvents of methanol/water/acetic acid, typically in the proportions 90/10/0.01 (v/v/v) for a quick screen of the products formed, and 80/20/0.01 (v/v/v) for more detailed analysis and collection of individual compounds. Triphenylphosphine in methanol was used for reduction of fatty acid hydroperoxides. Normal phase HPLC was carried out using an Alltech 5-μm silica column (25 × 0.46 cm) and solvents of hexane/isopropanol/glacial acetic acid (100:2:0.1 v/v/v) for free acids and hexane/isopropanol (100:1 or 100:0.5 v/v) for methyl ester derivatives. Methyl esters were prepared with diazomethane and trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives usingN,O-bis-[trimethylsilyl]trifluoacetamide/pyridine. Products were hydrogenated prior to silylation in 100 μl of ethanol using palladium of carbon (1–2 mg) and bubbling with hydrogen for 2–5 min; water was then added and the products extracted with ethyl acetate. GC-MS analyses were carried out in the electron impact mode (70 eV) using a Finnigan Incos 50 mass spectrometer coupled to a Hewlett-Packard 5890 gas chromatograph equipped with a SPB-1 fused silica capillary column (5 or 15 m × 0.25 mm, internal diameter). Samples were injected at 190 °C and the temperature was subsequently programmed to 300 °C at 10 or 20 °C/min. The initial velocity of the AOS was determined on an Applied Photophysics Ltd. Model SX17MV stopped-flow spectrometer operated in the absorption mode at 25 °C. The wavelength was set up at 235 nm through a monochromator with a 1-cm path length. The AOS and 8R-HPETE were prepared in 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.9. The AOS was used at a final concentration of 4.4 × 10−8mwith final substrate concentrations ranging from 0 to 70 μm. Measurements at higher substrate concentrations (120–160 μm) were made using a 0.2-cm path length flow cell with the concentration of AOS decreased to 1.1 × 10−8m; the values obtained were normalized to a 1-cm path length. Following each injection, the decrease in absorbance at 235 nm was followed for 60 s. The value at each substrate concentration was the average of seven individual experiments. The data were fit to a linear equation to determine the initial velocity of the enzyme for each substrate concentration. The velocities obtained were then plotted against the substrate concentration with GraphPad Prism Application (GraphPad Software, Inc) and the K m and V max were calculated by using the double-reciprocal Lineweaver-Burk transformation. The partition ratio, the average number of turnovers associated with inactivation of an enzyme molecule, was determined from the molar concentration of product formed after complete enzyme inactivation compared with the initial concentration of enzyme (23.Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out using several enzyme concentrations in 500 μl of 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.9, containing an excess of 8R-HPETE substrate (63.4 μm). The AOS was added at concentrations ranging between 0.11 × 10−9m to 0.77 × 10−9m. The decrease in absorbance at 235 nm was followed until the enzyme was completely inactivated and the absorbance stabilized. Concentrations of 8R-HPETE were calculated using a molar extinction coefficient of 23,000 at 235 nm (24Gibian M.J. Vandenberg P. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 163: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The primary structure of the lipoxygenase domain of the coral fusion protein shows an alignment with mammalian lipoxygenases such that position 372 of the fusion protein aligns with the initiating methionine of mammalian lipoxygenases. A construct of the coral lipoxygenase sequence (amino acids 372–1067) was prepared in pET3a vector and including a His tag sequence at the 5′ end. Expression of the lipoxygenase domain inE. coli (BL21 cells) gave highly active enzyme, with the activity recovered in the 10,000 × g pellet of sonicated cells. The lipoxygenase was solubilized using Emulphogene BC-720TM detergent (0.1%); it could then be purified by affinity chromatography on a nickel-NTA column (Fig.1). The enzyme was fairly stable in the column eluant (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.9, 0.2% Emulphogene); it retained about half its original activity after 3 months at 4 °C. The LOX domain showed maximum rates of reaction at pH 7–7.5 (Fig. 2). Spectrophotometric reactions were often performed at pH 8 to improve the solubility of substrate and hence the clarity of the solution.Figure 2LOX activity pH profile. Arachidonic acid 30 μm was incubated in a cuvette with 500 μl of buffer (♦, glycine sodium hydroxide; ▪, Tris·HCl; ▴, potassium phosphate) at the indicated pH. After mixing and establishing a constant absorbance reading at 235 nm, the lipoxygenase was added. There was no detectable lag phase. Reaction rates, taken from the linear part of the curve, are represented as the initial rate of absorbance increase at 235 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The lipoxygenase domain exhibited some interesting and unusual kinetic properties. Initially, we noted substantially higher catalytic activity in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer compared with 100 mm Tris·HCl (both buffers at pH 8.0). Such an effect might be due to the difference in the ionic strength of the two buffers (25Hamberg M. Gerwick W.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Indeed, addition of inorganic cations normalized the difference between the two buffers and gave an additional increase in catalytic activity (Fig.3 A). By contrast, a higher concentration of Tris·HCl (0.5 m) was ineffective. The effect of inorganic cations reached a maximum at a concentration of 500 mm; the enzyme did not discriminate markedly between KCl, LiCl, or NaCl (Fig. 3 A). Although the enzyme was not calcium-dependent (2 mm EDTA had no effect on catalysis), activity was further enhanced by addition of millimolar concentrations of CaCl2 (Fig. 3 B). By contrast, MgCl2 (10 mm) had no effect. Although the enzymatic activity is increased in the presence of 500 mmNaCl, the substrate inhibition displayed by the lipoxygenase at arachidonic acid concentrations over 50 μm was not markedly changed (Fig. 4). The enzyme exhibited a turnover number of 300–350/s in pH 8 Tris containing 500 mm NaCl and 10 mm CaCl2.Figure 4Lipoxygenase activity as a function of arachidonic acid concentration. Arachidonic acid at concentrations ranging from 6 to 120 μm was incubated in a cuvette with 500 μl of 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.9, and with (♦) or without (▪) 0.5 m NaCl. After checking that the absorbance at 235 nm was constant, the lipoxygenase (18.6 pmol) was added and the increase in absorbance was monitored. The rate of reaction was represented as amount of 8R-HPETE formed/min/pmol of enzyme.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the absence of substrate, the lipoxygenase domain rapidly lost activity upon dilution from the concentrated stock solution kept in nickel column elution buffer. The key ingredient for enzyme stability in the nickel column elution buffer was the 0.5% concentration of Emulphogene detergent. The lipoxygenase, however, was not catalytically active in the presence of 0.1–0.5% Emulphogene. Accordingly, this detergent could not be used to prolong the lifetime of the enzyme under conditions suitable for metabolism of substrate. The enzyme also was inhibited in its catalytic activity by other detergents including octyl glucoside (25 mm), CHAPS (10 mm), reduced Triton X-100 (0.1%), Nonidet P-40 (0.29 mm), Triton X-100 (0.24 mm), and sodium cholate (14 mm). Glycerol at 10–20% (v/v) slightly increased the rate of reaction with arachidonic acid without substantially prolonging the lifetime of the active enzyme. Concentrations of 40% glycerol slowed the reaction rate but also preserved the catalytically active enzyme and, remarkably, led to the highest conversion of substrate. The lipoxygenase domain showed a preference for C20 or C22 highly polyunsaturated fatty acids. The C18 fatty acids, linoleic acid, α-linolenic acid, and γ-linolenic acid, were not substrates. The best substrate was 22.6ω3 (designated as 100% relative reaction rate), followed by 20.5ω3 (85%), 20.4ω6 (70%), and 20.3ω6 (35%). The major hydroperoxy products of these fatty acids were, in turn, substrates of the AOS domain. Reactions with 100 μmsubstrate were conducted at room temperature in a UV cuvette while monitoring at 235 nm. After completion of reaction (1–2 min) the products were extracted, reduced with triphenylphosphine, and analyzed by HPLC, UV spectroscopy, and GC-MS. Arachidonic acid was converted to 8R-HPETE (Fig. 5 A). Similarly, 20.5ω3 and 22.6ω3 were converted to single products, identified by GC-MS analysis of the triphenylphosphine-reduced, hydrogenated methyl ester TMS ether derivatives. The hydrogenated product from 20.5ω3 gave an identical mass spectrum to hydrogenated 8-HETE (26Boeynaems J.M. Brash A.R. Oates J.A. Hubbard W.C. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 104: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and thus the enzymatic product is 8-hydroperoxyeicosa-5,9,11,14,17-pentaenoic acid. The hydrogenated product from 22.6ω3 showed prominent α-cleavage ions atm/z 271 (C1-C10) and m/z 273 (C10-C22), and thus the parent product is the 10-hydroperoxydocosa-4,7,11,13,16,19-hexaenoic acid. Reaction with 20.3ω6 gave a major 8-hydroperoxy product, as expected, and three minor products designated as A (2–5% of products in different experiments), B (2–5%), and C (5%) (Fig. 5 B). Product A was not identified. Product B showed only end absorbance in the UV and a shorter retention time on RP-HPLC than 15-hydroxyeicosatrienoic acid, which is the earliest eluting of the four conjugated diene-containing monohydroxy derivatives of 20.3ω6. On normal phase-HPLC, product B chromatographed just after 11-hydroxyeicosatrienoic acid. Product B was hydrogenated and analyzed by GC-MS in the electron impact mode as the TMS ester TMS ether derivative. The mass spectrum showed a base peak at m/z 73 and prominent high mass ions at m/z 457 (M − 15, 2% relative abundance to the base peak at m/z 73) andm/z 441 (M − 31, 2%). Besides the ions below 100 atomic mass units, the two most prominent ions were m/z 331 (C1-C8, 27%) and m/z 243 (C8–C20, 24%), consistent with α-cleavage at a C10 hydroxyl (27Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Capdevila J.H. Suresh Y. Blair I.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 321: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The mass spectrum indicates a 10-hydroxyeicosanoic acid structure of the hydrogenated product B. In accord with this result, the UV characteristics and chromatographic behavior of the parent non-hydrogenated product B correspond to the known properties of the arachidonic acid product, 10-HETE (27Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Capdevila J.H. Suresh Y. Blair I.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 321: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, product B is identified as 1"

In contrast to Saos-2 cells in which p53 activated both the p21 andbax promoters, in MDA-MB-453 cells p53 activated thep21 promoter, but failed to activate the baxpromoter. Neither phosphorylation of p53 on serines 315 or 392 nor an intact C terminus was required for p53-dependent activation of the bax promoter, demonstrating that this differential regulation of bax could not be explained solely by modifications of these residues. Further, this effect was not due to either p73 or other identified cellular factors competing with p53 for binding to its response element in the bax promoter. p53 expressed in MDA-MB-453 cells also failed to activate transcription through the p53 response element of the bax promoter in isolation, demonstrating that the defect is at the level of the interaction between p53 and its response element. In contrast to other p53 target genes, like p21, in which p53-dependent transcriptional activation is mediated by a response element containing two consensus p53 half-sites, activation by p53 of the bax element was mediated by a cooperative interaction of three adjacent half-sites. In addition, the interaction of p53 with its response element from the bax promoter, as compared with its interaction with its element from the p21promoter, involves a conformationally distinct form of the protein.

The p53 protein has been implicated in several diverse growth-related pathways, including apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and senescence (3Ko L.J. Prives C.

The ability of p53 to function as a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein appears to be central to the function of p53 as a tumor suppressor (6Bargonetti J. Friedman P.N. Kern S.E. Vogelstein B.

Science. 1990; 249: 1046-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) that is linked to a central core domain that mediates sequence-specific DNA binding (9Bargonetti J. Manfredi J.J. Chen X.

The importance of the DNA binding domain is further highlighted by the fact that the major mutational hot spots from human cancers are found in this domain (13Prives C. Cell. 1994; 78: 543-546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and several of these mutations have been shown to abolish the ability of p53 to function as a transcriptional activator (14Kern S.E.

A DNA consensus sequence through which p53 binds and activates transcription has been identified. This sequence consists of two palindromic decamers of 5′-RRRCWWGYYY-3′ (where R is a purine, Y is a pyrimidine, and W is an adenine or thymine) separated by 0–13 bp,1 forming four repeats of the pentamer 5′-RRRCW-3′ alternating between the top and bottom strands of the DNA duplex (17el-Deiry W.S.

This arrangement is consistent with the notion that p53 binds DNA as a homotetramer (20Friedman P.N. Chen X. Bargonetti J. Prives C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Data are consistent with a model in which DNA damage leads to the phosphorylation of p53 as well as the subsequent stabilization of p53 and activation of its DNA binding capability (32Haupt Y.

When compared with alternate p53 targets, such as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, evidence suggests that the bax gene is differentially regulated by p53. Several tumor-derived p53 mutants have been identified that are capable of activating transcription through the promoter of the p21 gene but not through the baxpromoter (36Di Como C.J. Prives C. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 37Flaman J.M. Robert V. Lenglet S. Moreau V. Iggo R. Frebourg T.

This has been correlated with an inability of the mutants both to bind the p53 response element of the baxpromoter and to trigger apoptosis (36Di Como C.J. Prives C. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 38Friedlander P. Haupt Y. Prives C. Oren M. Mol. Cell.

Such studies with these tumor-derived p53 mutants suggest that a failure in the ability of p53 to activate the bax gene may play an important role in tumor formation and progression. As such, a complete understanding of the transcriptional regulation of the bax promoter by p53 may yield important information relevant to our understanding of tumorigenesis. Previous studies have demonstrated that the bax promoter is differentially regulated by wild-type p53 in a cell type-specific manner (40Zhan Q. Fan S. Bae I. Guillouf C. Liebermann D.A. O'Connor P.M. Fornace Jr., A.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3743-3751PubMed Google Scholar). Here the osteosarcoma Saos-2 and the breast carcinoma MDA-MB-453 cell lines were used as a model system to explore the potential mechanisms for this differential regulation. In the Saos-2 cell line, transfected wild-type p53 effectively activated transcription through both the p21 and baxpromoters. In contrast, p53 expressed in the MDA-MB-453 cell line was capable of activating transcription through the p21 promoter as well as the p53 response elements of the p21,cyclin G and cdc25C promoters but failed to do so through either the bax promoter or the isolated p53 response element derived from the bax promoter. Neither p53 phosphorylation at serine 315 or serine 392 nor an intact C terminus was required for activation of the bax promoter, demonstrating that the observed defect in MDA-MB-453 cells could not be explained solely by modifications of these residues. In addition, neither the p53 homolog p73 nor other cellular factors that are capable of binding the p53 response element of the bax promoter explained the differential regulation of the bax promoter. Detailed analysis of the interaction of p53 with the baxpromoter, however, demonstrated that unlike other well characterized p53 response elements, like that of the p21 gene, in which p53-dependent transcriptional activation is mediated by a response element containing two consensus p53 half-sites, the response element of the bax promoter consists of three adjacent half-sites that cooperate to bring about complete activation by p53. In addition, it appears that p53 exists in a distinct conformation when bound to its response element from the bax promoter as compared with when it is bound to the 5′-response element of thep21 promoter. Together, these data suggest a potential mechanism for the cell type-specific differential regulation ofbax by p53.

The osteosarcoma Saos-2 cell line and the breast carcinoma MDA-MB-453 cell line were maintained in a humidified tissue culture incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Saos-2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. MDA-MB-453 cells were grown in RPMI medium, containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5 μg/ml insulin. Unless otherwise indicated, 1 × 105 cells were seeded into 35-mm plates. Cells were transfected 24 h later using the DOTAP liposomal transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cellular lysates were prepared 48 h post-transfection, total protein concentration was determined by protein assay (Bio-Rad), and luciferase assays were quantitated using a commercially available kit (Promega) and a TD-20e Luminometer (Turner). All procedures were conducted at 4 °C. For each 100-mm dish, cells were washed three times with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Cells then were scraped into 500 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μm leupeptin, and 50 μg/ml aprotinin) and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min. Pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of nuclear extraction buffer (lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl) and incubated end-over-end for 60 min. Samples were centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 10 min.

In brief, Sf9 cells that were infected with recombinant baculovirus expressing His-tagged p53 were lysed in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 20% glycerol, 10 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μm leupeptin, and 50 μg/ml aprotinin (Buffer L).

Extracts were diluted to 100 mm NaCl with Buffer L, applied to a 0.5-ml nickel nitriloacetic acid agarose column (Qiagen) that was equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES containing 100 mm NaCl and eluted with 200 mm imidazole containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 5 mm NaCl. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected, dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mmNaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, and 1 mmdithiothreitol, aliquoted, and stored at −70 °C. Purified p53 protein or nuclear extract was incubated with 3 ng of radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide and hybridoma supernatant where appropriate in a total volume of 30 μl of DNA binding buffer, containing 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mmspermidine, 0.7 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 25 μg/ml poly[d(I-C)] for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were loaded on a native 4% acrylamide gel and electrophoresed in 0.5× TBE at 225 V for 2 h at 4 °C. Gels were dried and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film using an intensifying screen at −70 °C. Bands were scanned and quantitated using the Molecular Analyst Imaging Densitometer (Bio-Rad). Cells were lysed in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μm leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. The protein concentration of each sample was determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay. Samples containing equal amounts of protein were electrophoresed in a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Following electrophoresis, protein was transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with a 1:1 mixture of the anti-p53 mouse monoclonal antibodies 1801 and 421. The secondary antibody was a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, and the signal was detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Wild-type p53 expressed in the breast carcinoma MDA-MB-453 cell line is unable to activate transcription through thebax promoter or through the isolated p53 response element of the bax promoter (Figs.1 A and2 A). Luciferase reporter plasmids containing either the p21 promoter or thebax promoter were transfected into the p53-negative Saos-2 or MDA-MB-453 cell line with pCMV vector, increasing amounts of a plasmid expressing wild-type p53, or a plasmid expressing the mutant p53V143A. In the Saos-2 cell line, wild-type p53 effectively activated transcription of reporter constructs containing either the p21 or bax promoters. In contrast, wild-type p53 expressed in the MDA-MB-453 cell line, although still capable of activating transcription of a reporter containing thep21 promoter, failed to activate transcription through a construct containing the bax promoter (Fig. 1 A). Western blots demonstrated that p53 was expressed to equivalent levels in the two cell lines (Fig. 1 B, compare lane 9with lane 10 and lane 11 with lane 12), if not slightly higher in MDA-MB-453 (Fig. 1 B,lanes 10 and 12), suggesting that the failure of p53 to activate transcription through the bax promoter is not due to decreased levels of p53 protein expression.Figure 2Expression of wild-type p53 in MDA-MB-453 cells fails to activate transcription through a 37-bp element of thebax promoter. Saos-2 (A) and MDA-MB-453 (A and B) cells were transfected as described under “Materials and Methods” with 2 μg of the indicated reporter constructs in the presence of 0, 5, 50, 100, or 200 ng of pCMV-p53wt or 50 ng of pCMV-p53V143A. 48 h post transfection cells were lysed and assayed for total protein and luciferase activity as described under “Materials and Methods.” Appropriate amounts of the vector pCMV were added to each transfection mixture to maintain a constant level of plasmid DNA of 2.2 μg/sample. The Bax (1x) data are enlarged for clarity (inset A). The plots shown in the insets have the same scale. The indicated values are the average of three independent experiments each performed in duplicate. The numbers above eachbar indicate the fold activation for each pTATA construct observed with pCMV-p53wt or pCMV-p53V143A as compared with pCMV.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the isolated p53 response element of thebax promoter was sufficient for this differential effect, synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to the p53 response elements of the p21 and bax promoters were cloned into the pGL3-E1bTATA luciferase reporter vector, upstream from the minimal adenovirus E1b promoter. Each reporter construct again was transfected into either the Saos-2 or MDA-MB-453 cell line with pCMV vector, increasing amounts of the wild-type p53 expression plasmid, or the mutant p53V143A expression plasmid. In the Saos-2 cell line, wild-type p53 effectively activated transcription of constructs containing either the 5′ or the 3′ p53 response elements from thep21 promoter (Fig. 2 A), as well as a construct containing the p53 response element of the bax promoter (Fig. 2 A, inset). As observed with the promoter constructs, wild-type p53 expressed in the MDA-MB-453 cell line failed to activate transcription via an E1b reporter plasmid containing the p53 response element of the bax promoter (Fig. 2 A, inset), whereas activating reporters containing either the 5′ or the 3′ element of the p21promoter (Fig. 2 A). Expression of wild-type p53 in MDA-MB-453 cells also activated transcription of reporters containing the p53 response elements of the cyclin G andcdc25C genes (Fig. 2 B). Thus, the defect in p53-dependent transcriptional activation of thebax promoter appears to be at the level of the interaction of p53 with its response element. The data presented in Figs. 1 and 2 demonstrate that in MDA-MB-453 cells there is a defect in wild-type p53-dependent activation via the 37-bp p53 response element of the bax promoter, as compared with the 5′ p53 response element of the p21 promoter. To understand the molecular mechanism mediating this differential regulation of the p53 response elements, the interaction between p53 and its response element from the bax promoter was examined in detail by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Previous studies localized the p53 response element of the bax promoter to a 37-bp region at −113 to −77 from the start site of transcription (29Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). An examination of the nucleotide sequence of this 37-bp element revealed three potential p53 binding sites, termed Site A, Site B, and Site C (Fig. 3), that correspond to the consensus site for p53 binding (17el-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar, 18Funk W.D. Pak D.T. Karas R.H. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Mol. Cell.

Site A consists of the first 21 bp of the 37-bp response element, with two potential p53 half-sites separated by a 1-bp insert. The first half-site contains three bases that vary from the consensus (two purine-to-pyrimidine changes in the first quarter-site and one in the second quarter-site). The second half-site of Site A matches the consensus sequence in all 10 bases. Site B consists of 20 bp including this same “consensus” half-site and a second half-site downstream, separated by no intervening sequences. Site B diverges from the consensus at three bases (the A/T is a G in the last position of the third quarter-site, and there are two purine-to-pyrimidine changes in the fourth quarter-site). Site C consists of 26 bp and includes the same half-site noted in Sites A and B, separated from a second half-site by a 6-bp insert. Site C contains two variations from the consensus sequence (a C to A change and a purine-to-pyrimidine change both in the fourth quarter site). Of note is the spatial relationship of these three potential p53 binding sites. The three sites overlap one another with the consensus half-site (−102 to −93) common to each. Because of this shared half-site, the binding of p53 to one site excludes its simultaneous binding to either of the other sites. Therefore, if one assumes that p53 binds as a tetramer (20Friedman P.N. Chen X. Bargonetti J. Prives C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3319-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 21McLure K.G. Lee P.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3342-3350Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 22Stenger J.E. Mayr G.A. Mann K. Tegtmeyer P. Mol. Carcinog. 1992; 5: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), then only one site can be occupied at any given time. To identify which of these putative binding sites are responsible for the interaction between p53 and the bax promoter, synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides were constructed to model each site (Table I). The Bax oligonucleotide contained the complete 37-bp p53 response element from thebax promoter. Oligo A contained the 21 bp corresponding to Site A, whereas Oligo B contained the 20 bp corresponding to Site B. Oligo C consisted of the 26 bp corresponding to Site C; however, because of the sequence overlap between Sites B and C the 6 bp separating the two half-sites in Site C were scrambled to abolish any potential contribution from Site B. Each oligonucleotide contained identical flanking sequences that allowed for its subsequent cloning into a luciferase reporter plasmid. The relative affinities of these oligonucleotides for p53 were assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Purified p53 bound the labeled Bax oligonucleotide containing the entire 37-bp p53 response element (Fig.4 A, lane 1), and this binding was effectively competed by an excess of the same, unlabeled oligonucleotide (Fig. 4 A, lanes 2–4). Unlabeled Oligo A, Oligo B, and Oligo C also successfully competed for p53 binding (Fig. 4 A, lanes 5–7,8–10, and 11–13). For comparison, an unrelated control oligonucl"

Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Lippencott-Raven, Philadelphia1996: 1447-1472Google Scholar). The viral RNA segments, L, M, and S, encode an RNA dependent RNA polymerase, two envelope glycoproteins, and nucleocapsid (N)1protein, respectively. In mature virions, multiple copies of the N protein coat each of the genomic segments (vRNAs) to form three distinct ribonucleoprotein complexes, which may also include the viral polymerase. The N protein has been suggested to play a functional role in replication and/or transcription, perhaps by providing a mechanism for controlling the amount or rate of macromolecular synthesis. Precedent exists for such activities with analogous proteins of other negative-strand RNA viruses such as those in theRhabdoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, andOrthomyxoviridae families. The N protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) modulates the transition from transcription to replication (2Patton J.T. Davis N.L. Wertz G.W. J. Virol. 1984; 49: 305-309Crossref Google Scholar), while the influenza nucleoprotein is required for RNA synthesis (3Honda A. Ueda K. Nagata K. Ishihama A. J. Biochem.

Virol. 1991; 65: 2170-2178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and rabies virus (11Yang J. Hooper D.C. Wunner W.H. Koprowski H. Dietzschold B. Fu Z.F. Virology. 1998; 242: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For hantaviruses, however, little is known regarding the mechanism for encapsidating viral RNA or the role that N protein plays in regulating viral transcription and replication. The proposed activities of the hantavirus N protein in the virus life cycle rely on differential interactions with the three types of viral RNAs, the vRNA, the virus complementary (cRNA) and the messenger RNA (mRNA). The mechanism for selective encapsidation of the vRNA and cRNA by the N protein remains a central question in the hantavirus replication cycle as well as those of other members of the familyBunyaviridae. Cell culture-based experiments with Bunyamwera virus suggested that encapsidation requires full-length vRNA or cRNA because mRNA was not found in nucleocapsids (12Jin H. Elliot R.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1396-1404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mRNA is quite distinct in structure and sequence from the vRNA; with truncated 3′ termini and extended 5′ termini observed on all members of theBunyaviridae. The 3′ truncation prevents base pairing of the complementary sequences at the 3′ and 5′ termini of the vRNA and cRNA and results in the inability of the mRNA to form panhandle structures. Thus, while vRNA and cRNA can form noncovalently, closed circular structures, mRNA cannot (13Raju R. Kolakofsky D. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 122-128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This observation led to the suggestion that this gene region may play a role in assembly of the nucleocapsids, however, no sequences or secondary structures in any of the viral RNAs have been defined (14Hacker D. Raju R. Kolakofsky D. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 5166-5174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further, no readily identifiable RNA binding motifs have been located in N proteins, although deletion mapping of Hantaan (HTNV) and Puumala virus (PUUV) N proteins identified a nonspecific RNA binding domain in the carboxyl-terminal 93 amino acids (15Gott P. Stohwasser R. Schnitzler P. Darai G. Bautz E.K.F. Virology. 1993; 194: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This region showed no apparent specificity for viral RNA. The N protein clearly functions in the viral replication cycle through its interactions with the viral nucleic acids and with other structural proteins. The biochemical and molecular determinants that promote interactions between the N protein and the viral RNAs have not been defined. To begin to address the biochemical basis of N protein and viral RNA interactions, we investigated the first event in the assembly process, the binding step. We report procedures for obtaining highly purified hantavirus N protein and for measuring its interactions with RNA. Using these methods, we defined the dissociation constant for HTNV N protein-RNA interactions under several solution conditions. In addition, we explored the ability of a heterologous N protein from Sin Nombre virus (SNV) to interact with HTNV-derived RNAs and a nonviral RNA. The S segment open reading frame (S ORF) representing the HTNV N protein was cloned by polymerase chain reaction amplification with 5′ and 3′ primers engineered with flanking NdeI and XhoI sites. The amplified HTNV S ORF was cloned into the NdeI andXhoI sites of pET23b (Novagen) to create the expression plasmid, pHTNV-N, and was sequenced with an ABI automated sequencer. Cloning into the XhoI site created a C-terminal fusion of a hexahistidine tag (predicted mass = 49.06 kDa). The hexahistidine tag has been shown previously by others to not effect N protein RNA binding reactions (15Gott P. Stohwasser R. Schnitzler P. Darai G. Bautz E.K.F. Virology. 1993; 194: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, experiments were also performed using the HTNV N protein expressed from the pFLAG vector (Sigma) (16Wang M. Rossi C. Schmaljohn C.S. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 1115-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The Hantaan virus S segment ORF was cloned into the EcoRI site of pFLAG1 to create an N-terminal fusion of the omp signal peptide followed by the FLAG epitope. Enterokinase can cleave the FLAG peptide from the HTNV N protein and will leave an amino-terminal Leu, (predicted mass = 48.2 kDa). The plasmid expression vector, pSNV-N pET-1, (gift of Brian Hjelle, University of New Mexico) contains the entire ORF representing the SNV N protein (isolate 3H226). The ORF is cloned into the HindIII and XhoI sites of the pET23b expression vector, with an N-terminal fusion of the T7 leader and a C-terminal fusion of a hexahistidine tag; thus, the SNV fusion protein had a predicted size of 51.4 kDa. The expression, purification and enterokinase cleavage of soluble HTNV N-FLAG were performed as described previously (16Wang M. Rossi C. Schmaljohn C.S. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 1115-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The enterokinase-cleaved HTNV N protein fractions were stored at −80 °C in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1m glycine. Prior to analysis in RNA filter binding reactions, the cleaved protein was concentrated, and washed and resuspended in binding buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 80 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, and 1.5 mmDTT). HTNV and SNV N proteins, expressed in BL21DE3 from the pET23b vector, were purified using methods previously described (17Balakrishnan M. Zastrow D. Jonsson C.B. Virology. 1996; 219: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). BL21DE3 harboring pET23b was included as a negative control during expression and purification. Column fractions of HTNV N protein, SNV N protein and pET23b purifications were adjusted to an A 595 of 0.2 and refolded by dialysis through a stepwise dilution of urea from 3 to 0 m urea as described previously (17Balakrishnan M. Zastrow D. Jonsson C.B. Virology. 1996; 219: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Final dialysis of the protein fractions was conducted in Buffer C (200 mmNaCl, 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.4% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol). The final buffers were rendered RNase-free by pretreatment of the components with diethylpyrocarbonate before autoclaving, or by preparing the solutions from diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water and RNase-free molecular biology grade reagents (Sigma). The refolded protein fractions were flash frozen on dry ice and stored at −80 °C. Column fractions were followed by 12% SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Protein concentrations were measured using the Bradford method (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) with Bio-Rad Micro-Assay reagents as recommended. The primary antibody for detecting the SNV N protein was inactivated human serum from a patient diagnosed with acute hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (Chiron). The secondary antibody for detecting the SNV N protein was affinity-purified biotinylated goat anti-human IgG (H+L) (Vector Laboratories). The primary antibody for detecting HTNV N protein was hyperimmune mouse ascitic fluid to authentic HTNV 76–118 (19Schmaljohn C.S. Jennings G.B. Hay J. Dalrymple J.M. Virol. 1986; 155: 633-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The secondary antibody for detecting HTNV N protein was affinity-purified biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Vector Laboratories). HTNV vRNA was transcribed from the vector pGEM1-HTNVS (19Schmaljohn C.S. Jennings G.B. Hay J. Dalrymple J.M. Virol. 1986; 155: 633-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The plasmid contains the genomic HTNV S segment cloned into the PstI site of the pGEM1 plasmid (Promega). An S ORF RNA was generated by transcription from the HTNV S cDNA (pHTNV-N), and a nonviral 67-nucleotide control RNA was transcribed from pGEM7Zf+. In preparation for the in vitro transcription reactions, pGEM1-HTNV S was digested withXbaI, pHTNV-N was digested with XhoI, and pGEM7Zf+ was digested with SmaI. [32P]UMP radiolabeled transcripts were produced from linearized plasmids using the MaxiScript SP6/T7 RNA Transcription Kit (Ambion). Transcription of the pGEM1-HTNV S template creates an additional 20 and 12 nucleotides derived from pGEM1 on the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. Purification of the RNA transcripts was performed using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen). Purified RNA was stored at −20 °C in 25-μl aliquots for up to 2 weeks. Typically, RNA transcripts had specific activities of 1 × 108 cpm/μg. The following RNase-free components were combined on ice in a final volume of 20 μl: 40 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, N protein, and 1 μl of [32P]UTP-labeled RNA (1 ng) along with variable concentrations of MgCl2, NaCl, and KCl as noted in figure legends. In standard reactions, 29 ng/μl SNV N protein or 175 ng/μl HTNV N protein were added to reaction buffer and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. One μg of heparin was then added, and reactions were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. RNA-protein complexes were covalently cross-linked by exposing binding reactions to 1.8 kJ of UV light in a UV cross-linker (UVC500, Hoeffer). Unbound RNA was digested by adding 50 units of RNase T1 (Ambion) to the SNV-RNA or 1 unit of RNase V1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to HTNV N-RNA binding reactions, and incubating for 30 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped with 2× loading buffer (0.125 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.4% sodium dodecyl sulfate (w/v), 0.28 m β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol (v/v), and 0.01 mg/ml bromphenol blue), heated to 95 °C, and separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried, and the results visualized by exposing to autoradiographic film or by using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Signals were quantitated using ImageQuaNTTM version 4.2 software (Molecular Dynamics). HTNV RNAs were prepared by in vitro transcription in the presence of [α-32P]UTP as described above. HTNV N protein was serially diluted in binding buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 40 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, and 1.5 mm DTT) to give a final concentration range of 3.5 × 10−9 to 3.5 × 10−6m. SNV N protein was serially diluted in binding buffer to give a final concentration range of 5.6 × 10−10 to 5.6 × 10−7m. Additional NaCl in the protein storage buffer brought the final NaCl concentration to 80 mm. One ng of [α-32P]UTP-labeled RNA was added, and the reactions were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. The reactions were slot-blotted (Bio-Rad) onto nitrocellulose filters as described by the manufacturer, and each well was washed with 200 μl of binding buffer. Limitations of filter binding assays include nonspecific retention of RNA on the membrane. Nonspecific retention of RNA was measured by filtering complete reaction mixtures in the absence of protein. Signals were quantitated by scintillation counting or by using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Dissociation constants (K d ) were averaged from a minimum of four independent experiments, and were calculated by fitting a nonlinear binding curve to the empirical data using the Origin program (MicroCal). The apparent K d corresponds to the concentration of N protein required to obtain half-saturation, assuming the complex formation obeys a simple bimolecular equilibrium. Interpretation of the data as a simple binding equilibrium between RNA and protein requires that the complex does not dissociate during the filtration process (20Carey J. Cameron V. de Haseth P.L. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2601-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Another limitation of the filter binding assay is the possible dissociation of the complex during filtration. The stability of the complex was experimentally confirmed (data not shown). A second inherent assumption in the assay is that the fractional retention of the different RNA-protein complexes is not due to the incomplete retention of the protein. In our assays, the fractional retention of the complexes ranged from 38% to 94%, depending on the RNA substrate. Therefore, we assumed the plateau in the percentage of binding of the RNA represented complete binding of the RNA substrate. BL21(DE3) cells harboring the expression vector, pHTNV-N or pSNV-N, were induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to express hantaviral N proteins. In addition, a mock purification with bacteria transformed with the parent vector, pET23B, was included as a negative control. Total protein from each of the induced cell cultures were similarly extracted under denaturing conditions, and solubilized protein was separated using nickel-affinity chromatography. Proteins bound to the nickel-affinity resin were eluted by a stepwise decrease in the pH of the running buffer from pH 6.3 to 5.9 and, finally, pH 4.5. High levels of SNV N protein expression were obtained and readily extracted as shown in the SDS-PAGE of the pelleted fraction recovered after detergent lysis and centrifugation (Fig.1, lane 1) and load (Fig. 1, lane 2). SNV N was recovered from the column in the pH 6.3 elution (Fig. 1, lane 5), the first seven fractions of the pH 5.9 step gradient (Fig. 1,lanes 6–8 and 10–12), and the first six fractions of the pH 4.5 step gradient (Fig. 1, lanes 13–18). Similar elution profiles were observed during the purification of the HTNV N protein. In the mock purification, no protein bands were observed at the expected molecular weight for hantaviral N proteins. UV cross-linking experiments showed the pH 4.5 fractions gave the greatest level of RNA binding activity (21Partin L.R. Biochemical Characterization of Hantavirus Nucleocapsid Protein RNA Binding and Morphological Characterization of Sin Nombre Virus Model Nucleocapsid-like Particles. M.Sc. thesis. New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM1997Google Scholar); thus, these were used in the various assays described herein. The interaction between the purified HTNV N protein and HTNV vRNA was first investigated using an assay in which the full-length S segment vRNA was cross-linked to N protein by exposure to ultraviolet light (UV cross-linking assay). After removing unbound RNA by RNase digestion, the reaction was examined by SDS-PAGE. The optimal conditions for forming complexes were determined earlier by extensive titrations of ionic strength, metal, and reducing agents in these UV cross-linking assays with the N protein (21Partin L.R. Biochemical Characterization of Hantavirus Nucleocapsid Protein RNA Binding and Morphological Characterization of Sin Nombre Virus Model Nucleocapsid-like Particles. M.Sc. thesis. New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM1997Google Scholar). Titrations experiments revealed an increase in the concentration of ribonucleoprotein complexes with increasing amounts of HTNV N protein and a constant level of HTNV vRNA (Fig. 2 A). Complexes were not detectable at 0.73 ng/μl (Fig. 2 A, lane 2); however, efficient cross-linking was observed at 7.3 ng/μl (Fig. 2 A, lane 3) and 14.5 ng/μl (Fig. 2 A, lane 4). At 29 ng/μl, the reaction became saturated, as determined by quantitation from the PhosphorImager analysis (Fig. 2 A, lane 5). We estimate that the concentration of the N protein required to saturate the reaction is greater than a 4000-fold excess of what would be necessary to encapsidate the vRNA with 1 protein per 10 nucleotides. These results are similar to encapsidation experiments previously published for VSV nucleocapsid interactions (10Moyer S.A. Smallwood-Kentro S. Haddad A. Prevec L. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2170-2178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using the same approach and binding conditions, a titration of purified SNV N protein to a constant amount of HTNV vRNA was examined (Fig.2 B). The highest level of signal was observed when the concentration of SNV N was 58 ng/μl (Fig. 2 B,lane 5). In addition, efficient cross-linking was observed at the concentrations of 7.3 ng/μl (Fig. 2 B,lane 2), 14.5 ng/μl (Fig. 2 B,lane 3), and 29 ng/μl (Fig. 2 B,lane 4). The protein concentrations that provided saturation levels for HTNV and SNV N proteins were used in all subsequent UV cross-linking experiments. Finally, the UV cross-linking studies revealed that the structure of the ribonucleoprotein complexes promoted by HTNV and SNV N proteins were clearly distinct on the HTNV vRNA template. HTNV complexes were sensitive to digestion with the double-stranded nuclease, RNase V1, but not with the single-stranded nuclease RNase T1. 2W. Severson and C. B. Jonsson, unpublished results. In contrast, SNV complexes were only sensitive to RNase T1 digestion. The UV cross-linking experiments confirmed the absence of other RNA-binding proteins in N protein preparations, and defined the basic conditions suitable for further studies of N protein-RNA interactions. However, the UV cross-linking assay is limited in that the accessibility of the nucleocapsid to RNase digestion as well as the activity of the RNase may vary under different ionic strength conditions. As exemplified by the nucleocapsid proteins of Sendai virus and VSV, increases in the ionic strength of the microenvironment may increase the tightness of nucleocapsid coiling, which can increase the resistance of the nucleocapsid to digestion with RNase (22Heggeness M.H. Scheid A. Chopin P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2631-2635Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Therefore, using the reaction conditions defined in the UV cross-linking experiments, we developed and used a filter binding assay to explore the dissociation constant (K d ) for formation of N protein-RNA complexes under several ionic strength conditions (Fig.3 A). For comparison, we examined the effect of ionic strength on nucleocapsid formation using the UV cross-linking assay (Fig. 3 B). Filter binding experiments were performed with increasing concentrations of HTNV N protein and a constant amount of HTNV vRNA (Fig. 3 A). NaCl concentrations were titrated from 0.05 to 1.0 m. From the resulting Klotz plot, aK d of 25 nm was calculated for the 50 mm NaCl binding isotherm. At 100 mm NaCl, the smallest dissociation constant, 14 nm, was observed. TheKd values observed at 0.25, 0.50, and 1.0m NaCl were 32, 42, and 47 nm, respectively (Table I). These experiments were repeated with a 3-fold higher concentration of vRNA (the upper limit allowed in our filter binding assay) and one-half the amount of N protein (Table I). The results were similar to those obtained with the standard assay conditions. In both experiments, theK d for the HTNV N protein-vRNA interactions did not vary substantially as the ionic strength was increased in the binding reaction buffer. This suggests nonelectrostatic contributions to formation and/or stability of the ribonucleoprotein complex.Table IEffect of NaCl concentration of HTNV N protein-vRNA complex formationReaction condition[vRNA] substrate K d1 ng3 ngnmnm50 mm NaCl25 ± 128 ± 3100 mm NaCl14 ± 113 ± 1250 mm NaCl32 ± 131 ± 3500 mmNaCl42 ± 120 ± 141000 mm NaCl47 ± 348 ± 12 Open table in a new tab Using conditions identical to those in the filter binding assays, NaCl concentrations were titrated and evaluated for their effect on complex formation of the HTNV N protein and HTNV vRNA by UV cross-linking. PhosphorImager analysis of the resulting N protein-RNA complex revealed the highest level of RNA binding at 100 mm NaCl (Fig.3 B, lane 3). The level of binding decreased minimally, 1.2-fold, as the ionic strength was decreased to 50 mm. As the NaCl concentration was increased from 0.25 to 0.50 m NaCl the level of N protein-RNA complex fell 1.1-fold (Fig. 3 B, lane 4) and 1.5-fold (Fig. 3 B, lane 5), respectively. RNase V1 displays optimal activity in reactions containing up to 0.5 m NaCl; therefore, as expected, no complex was observed at the 1.0 m NaCl concentrations (Fig.3 B, lane 6). In summary, both UV and filter binding assays showed a similar level of binding of the vRNA by the N protein over a wide range of ionic strength, 50–500 mm. While the UV cross-linking assay was limited to these lower NaCl concentrations, the filter binding assay clearly revealed a similar stability of the N protein-RNA complex at 100 mmand 1 m NaCl concentrations. Thus, the results suggest that electrostatic interactions are not a predominant factor in complex formation. In conjunction with the differential susceptibility of the HTNV N-vRNA complex to RNase V1 and RNase T1, these results suggest the major contributions to complex stability may be through short range van der Waals or dielectric interactions between the N protein and the phosphodiester backbone or nucleobases within single-stranded regions of the vRNA. In addition to monovalent ions, divalent ions can strongly influence the structure and stability of RNA (23Draper D.E. Misra V.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 927-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 24Pan T. Long D.M. Uhlenbeck O.C. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1996: 271-302Google Scholar). Alternatively, metal ions such as Mg2+ can compete with a RNA-binding protein for electrostatic-based interactions along the phosphodiester backbone of an RNA molecule. The ability of the metal ion to compete with the protein essentially reflects nonspecific protein-RNA interaction, as recently demonstrated in the interactions of the HIV-1 nucleocapsid and the tRNA3Lys (25Mely Y. deRocquigny H.

To explore the requirement for a metal ion in the in vitro binding reaction of the HTNV N-protein and vRNA, we examined the effects of MgCl2 on the RNA binding activity of the HTNV N proteins (Fig. 4, A andB). In experiments in which binding reactions contained a constant level of HTNV vRNA and a range of HTNV N protein, as the concentration of MgCl2 was increased, we noted a small shift in the binding isotherms toward an increase in K d (Fig.4 A). The K d for each HTNV N protein-RNA complex was calculated from the isotherms presented in Fig.4 A, and plotted against the MgCl2 concentration at which it was determined (Fig. 4 B). TheK d values determined at concentrations of MgCl2 ranging from 1 to 8 mm were similar. TheK d observed in the absence of MgCl2, 53 nm, was only slightly smaller. The highestK d was observed when 10 mmMgCl2 was included in the reactions, and represented a 2.4-fold increase in the K d as compared with theK d at 8 mm MgCl2. Overall, these studies do not support a major role for MgCl2 in promoting the interaction of the HTNV N protein and HTNV vRNA. A central question in the hantavirus replication cycle is how the N protein selectively encapsidates vRNA and cRNA, but not mRNA. To address this question, we explored the K d for HTNV and SNV N proteins complexed with two different viral RNAs, the full-length HTNV vRNA and an RNA representing the open reading frame of the HTNV S segment (S ORF RNA). The S ORF RNA is derived from the cRNA and does not contain the terminal complementary regions, which are expected to form the panhandle structure characteristic of vRNA and cRNA. The K d for the formation of a complex between the HTNV N protein and a nonspecific 67-nucleotide RNA (control RNA) was also examined. As described above, the addition of 1–8 mm MgCl2 in the binding reaction did not reduce the affinity of the HTNV N protein for HTNV vRNA. However, in the following, we decided to examine the binding of the three RNAs in the presence and absence of MgCl2 to explore its effect on alternative RNA substrates. Binding isotherms for the HTNV N protein and the three RNA substrates were defined for four different reaction conditions: 1) 40 mm NaCl (Fig. 5 A), 2) 40 mm NaCl and 1 mm MgCl2 (Fig.5 B), 3) 80 mm NaCl and 20 mm KCl (Fig. 5 C), and 4) 80 mm NaCl, 20 mmKCl, and 1 mm MgCl2 (Fig. 5 D). The dissociation constants for each binding isotherm are summarized in Table II. At low ionic strength, we observed little difference in the K d for HTNV N protein and the three RNA substrates, although theK d for the control RNA substrate was 3-fold higher (Fig. 5 A, Table II). The addition of 1 mmMgCl2 to the binding reaction with 40 mm NaCl enhanced the affinity of the HTNV N protein for the vRNA as compared with the S ORF and control RNAs (Fig. 5 B, Table II). The greatest difference in binding of the templates by the HTNV N protein was observed in experiments that increased the ionic strength of the binding reaction to 100 mm (4:1 NaCl:KCl). In these assays, we noted an approximate 5-fold increase in the preference of the HTNV N protein for its vRNA as compared with the S ORF and control RNAs (Fig.5 D, Table II).Table IIDissociation constants for HTNV N protein with various RNAsReaction conditionSubstrate K dvRNAS ORFControl RNAnmnmnm0 mm MgCl2, 40 mmNaCl140 ± 7140 ± 11430 ± 211 mm MgCl2, 40 mmNaCl70 ± 4120 ± 3310 ± 270 mmMgCl2, 80:20 mm NaCl/KCl35 ± 1110 ± 12110 ± 31 mm MgCl2, 80:20 mm NaCl/KCl53 ± 8270 ± 32260 ± 15 Open table in a new tab"

Although most Ig isotypes are secreted as monomers, IgM exists only as pentamers and hexamers, and IgA is found as both monomers and polymers of predominantly dimeric form. Both polymeric IgA and IgM are transported into external secretions due to their ability to bind the polymeric Ig receptor. Although all antibody-secreting cells produce J chain, it is incorporated only into polymeric Igs. Polymerization not only increases the avidity of Igs for antigen but also enhances effector functions, such as complement activation and binding to Fc receptors (1Smith R.I. Morrison S.L. Bio/Technology. 1994; 12: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 2Smith R.I. Coloma M.J. Morrison S.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2226-2236PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, understanding how polymerization is regulated and the requirements for polymer assembly is of great interest.Both IgA and IgM possess an 18-amino acid extension in the C terminus called the tail-piece (tp).1The conserved penultimate cysteine residue in the IgA and IgM tail-pieces has been demonstrated to be involved in polymerization (3Chapuis R.M. Koshland M.E. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 1320-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar,4Wiersma E.J. Chen F. Bazin R. Collins C. Painter R.H. Lemieux R. Shulman M.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1719-1726PubMed Google Scholar). Although the tail-pieces of IgA (αtp) and IgM (μtp) are similar in sequence, there are several differences (Fig. 1 A). Both tail-pieces contain an N-linked carbohydrate addition site, the presence of which is required for dimer formation in IgA (5Atkin J.D. Pleass R.J. Owens R.J. Woof J.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 156-159PubMed Google Scholar) and J chain incorporation and pentamer formation in IgM (4Wiersma E.J. Chen F. Bazin R. Collins C. Painter R.H. Lemieux R. Shulman M.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1719-1726PubMed Google Scholar). However, the structure and composition of the N-linked carbohydrates in the tail-pieces differ, suggesting differences in the accessibility of the glycans to processing by glycosyltransferases (6Mattu T.S. Pleass R.J. Willis A.C. Kilian M. Wormald M.R. Lellouch A.C. Rudd P.M. Woof J.M. Dwek R.A. J. Biol.

Tavill A.S. Louis L.N. Vaerman J.P. Lamm M.E. Kaetzel C.S. Hepatol. 1994; 19: 162-173PubMed Google Scholar). The penultimate cysteine in the tail-piece of one α chain forms a disulfide bond with J chain, which in turn forms a disulfide bond with the α chain of a second monomeric subunit (5Atkin J.D. Pleass R.J. Owens R.J. Woof J.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 156-159PubMed Google Scholar, 9Davis A. Shulman M.J. Immunol.

Hoppe-Seyler. 1992; 373: 1255-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It was suggested that J chain was required for polymerization of Igs, and indeed, polymerization by IgA does not take place in cells lacking J chain (12Krugmann S. Pleass R.J. Atkin J.D. Woof J.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 244-249PubMed Google Scholar). However, although IgM pentamers contain J chain, IgM hexamers have been shown to lack J chain (9Davis A. Shulman M.J. Immunol. Today. 1989; 4 (127–128): 118-122Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, all four isotypes of recombinant human IgGs containing the μtp form polymers without associating with J chain (1Smith R.I. Morrison S.L. Bio/Technology. 1994; 12: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar,2Smith R.I. Coloma M.J. Morrison S.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2226-2236PubMed Google Scholar).In the present study, we explore the effects of the tail-pieces and associated constant region domains on the polymerization state of Igs and their interactions with J chain by placing the αtp and μtp in the context of human IgM, IgA1, and IgG2 constant regions, as well as generating IgA1/IgG2 and IgM/murine IgG2b domain-exchanged mutants. Although both the αtp and μtp can effect polymerization in all contexts, the types of polymers formed were determined by the structural context of the tail-pieces. Analysis of domain-exchanged mutants revealed that the formation predominantly of dimers requires not only the αtp but also the CH3 domain of IgA. Although all proteins containing the μtp formed primarily higher order polymers, there does appear to be some specificity because wild type IgM formed primarily pentamers, whereas IgM-αtp formed mainly hexamers, and the domain-exchanged protein μμγμ-μtp formed tetramers and hexamers.J chain was not found in association with all polymers, indicating that the tail-piece alone is insufficient for J chain incorporation. Studies using IgA1/IgG2 and IgM/murine IgG2b domain-exchanged proteins suggest that the covalent association of J chain with polymeric Igs is determined by the structural context of the tail-piece. In the case of IgA1, the CH3 domain, in addition to either the αtp or μtp, is required for incorporation of J chain, whereas IgM requires CH3, CH4, and the μtp for J chain incorporation. Therefore, although both IgM and IgA associate with J chain, the types of protein-protein interactions made between J chain and the Igs may differ, resulting in the formation of pentamers for IgM and dimers for IgA. In addition, mutating the tail-piece of IgA to that of IgM results in altered carbohydrate processing, polymer assembly, and J chain incorporation.DISCUSSIONIn contrast to IgG, IgA and IgM exist as polymeric immunoglobulins. However, polymeric IgA is secreted mainly as dimers, whereas IgM is secreted as pentamers and hexamers. An interesting question is what directs IgA to form predominantly dimers, whereas IgM forms pentamers/hexamers. Previous studies and the current investigation have shown that the addition of the αtp or μtp to the C terminus of IgM, IgA, or IgG is sufficient for the formation of polymers; however, the selective formation of dimers in those Igs containing the αtp and pentamers/hexamers in those containing the μtp was not observed (2Smith R.I. Coloma M.J. Morrison S.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2226-2236PubMed Google Scholar, 18Sørensen V. Sundvold V. Michaelsen T.E. Sandlie I. J.

Immunol. 1996; 156: 2858-2865PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the tail-pieces by themselves do not contain all of the information necessary for the formation of specific polymers.We have now used domain-exchanged proteins to define the contribution of the constant region domains to polymer assembly. Because the Ig constant region domains are “modular” in nature, we believe that exchanging the domains between different Ig isotypes would not result in dramatic changes to the overall three-dimensional structure of the Igs. However, the contribution of subtle structural changes in the interdomain regions to polymer assembly and J chain incorporation cannot be ruled out. The results of this investigation are summarized in Table II. Interestingly, we have found that the selective formation of dimers occurred only in the presence of both Cα3 and αtp, but efficient dimer assembly was observed only when both Cα2 and Cα3 were present. Mutation of the six amino acids around Cys414 in CH2 of IgA to those of IgM did not alter assembly (18Sørensen V. Sundvold V. Michaelsen T.E. Sandlie I. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3448-3455PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that other regions in Cα2 contribute to efficient dimer formation. Pentamer assembly seems to require Cμ3, Cμ4, and the μtp.Table IISummary of results using tail-piece and domain exchange mutantsTypes of polymers formedAssociation with J chainCα3-αtpDimers2-aMore efficient dimer formation occurs when Cα2 is also present.+Cα3-μtp2-bCarbohydrate processing is altered so that some glycans remain in the high mannose form.Pentamers/hexamers+Cγ3-αtpAll types−Cμ3-Cμ4-μtpPentamers+Cμ3-Cμ4-αtpHexamers−Cγ2-Cμ4-μtpTetramers and hexamers−Cγ3-μtpAll types−2-a More efficient dimer formation occurs when Cα2 is also present.2-b Carbohydrate processing is altered so that some glycans remain in the high mannose form. Open table in a new tab J chain has been shown to be necessary for the assembly of IgA dimers (20Brewer J.W. Corley R.B. Mol. Immunol. 1997; 34: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 21Fazel S. Wiersma E.J. Shulman M.J. Int. Immunol. 1997; 9: 1149-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We now show that in the presence of αtp, the requirements for J chain incorporation closely resemble the requirements for specific dimer formation, namely the presence Cα3. Molecules containing Cγ3-αtp as well as IgM-αtp did not associate with J chain.Although J chain is associated with IgM pentamers, it is not associated with IgM hexamers (22Randall T.D. King L.B. Corley R.B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 1971-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The polymerization state of IgM has been shown to be regulated by the amount of J chain synthesized in that increases in J chain production led to an increase in the secretion of pentamers (23Randall T.D. Parkhouse R.M. Corley R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 962-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, we have found that placing the tail-piece of IgA on IgM resulted in the secretion of predominantly hexamers that lack J chain, and replacement of Cμ3 with Cγ2 resulted in tetramers and hexamers that lack J chain. In these cases, tetramer and hexamer formation does not appear to reflect limiting amounts of J chain because wild type IgM produced by the same cells formed predominantly pentamers associated with J chain. In addition, the preferential formation of IgM-αtp hexamers does not appear to be an artifact of this expression system because Sørensen et al. (18Sørensen V. Sundvold V. Michaelsen T.E. Sandlie I. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3448-3455PubMed Google Scholar) have recently made the same observation in a different cell line, although they did not examine J chain incorporation.In pentameric IgM, J chain is presumed to bind to two monomers, functioning as a “clasp” to close the circle of monomers (23Randall T.D. Parkhouse R.M. Corley R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 962-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); in hexameric IgM, it is an additional monomer that closes this circle. It has been proposed that chaperones retain partially assembled IgM polymers in the endoplasmic reticulum (24Sitia R. Neuberger M. Alberini C. Bet P. Fra A. Valetti C. Williams G. Milstein C. Cell. 1990; 60: 781-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Changing the IgM tail-piece to that of IgA may abolish specific structural motifs that are needed to interact with these chaperones for efficient incorporation of J chain into IgM pentamers. Alternatively, the structure of the αtp may be such that it leads to preferential formation of hexamers due to changes in the accessibility and/or orientation of the penultimate cysteine involved in polymerization.The carbohydrate present on both J chain and the α and μ tail-pieces plays a role in polymerization. The carbohydrate in μtp has been shown to be required for J chain incorporation (4Wiersma E.J. Chen F. Bazin R. Collins C. Painter R.H. Lemieux R. Shulman M.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1719-1726PubMed Google Scholar), and elimination of the carbohydrate from either J chain or αtp leads to decreased dimer formation (5Atkin J.D. Pleass R.J. Owens R.J. Woof J.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 156-159PubMed Google Scholar, 12Krugmann S. Pleass R.J. Atkin J.D. Woof J.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 244-249PubMed Google Scholar) and increased formation of higher order polymers (25Chuang P.D. Morrison S.L. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 724-732PubMed Google Scholar). The N-glycan on the αtp of IgA1 has been reported to be predominantly a triantennary complex oligosaccharide (6Mattu T.S. Pleass R.J. Willis A.C. Kilian M. Wormald M.R. Lellouch A.C. Rudd P.M. Woof J.M. Dwek R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2260-2272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), whereas IgM has been reported to have a high mannose carbohydrate in the tail-piece (7Wormald M.R. Wooten E.W. Bazzo R. Edge C.J. Feinstein A. Rademacher T.W. Dwek R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These differences in carbohydrate structure suggest that the two tail-pieces differ in their accessibility to processing by glycosyltransferases. Indeed, we found that IgA-μtp is heterogeneous in its glycosylation and contains glycans that can be removed by Endo H digestion, whereas all of the glycans on wild type IgA are Endo H-resistant. Polymeric IgM assembly is thought to occur through the stepwise addition of HL half-molecules, presumably limiting the accessibility of the tail-piece carbohydrate to processing by the glycosyltransferases (19Sørensen V. Rasmussen I.B. Norderhaug L. Natvig I. Michaelsen T.E. Sandlie I. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2858-2865PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that theN-linked carbohydrate in the tail-piece of IgA-μtp is similar to that of the tail-piece glycan of IgM suggests that IgA-μtp is also assembled such that its tail-piece glycan is not available for processing by the glycosyltransferases. These differences in carbohydrate processing suggest that changing the tail-piece alters the overall three-dimensional structure of the Igs, which affects polymer assembly and incorporation of J chain.Currently, there are no crystal structures available for IgA and IgM, although a theoretical model of monomeric IgA has been published recently (6Mattu T.S. Pleass R.J. Willis A.C. Kilian M. Wormald M.R. Lellouch A.C. Rudd P.M. Woof J.M. Dwek R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2260-2272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Previous models have suggested that two IgA monomers interact through the tail-pieces to form dimeric IgA, which lies tail-to-tail (12Krugmann S. Pleass R.J. Atkin J.D. Woof J.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 244-249PubMed Google Scholar). However, our studies indicate that both Cα3 and αtp are important in the assembly of dimers, suggesting that two IgA monomers may be interacting noncovalently through their CH3 domains in addition to forming covalent associations in the tail-piece. In this case, the structure of dimeric IgA would not be a linear molecule of two monomers lying tail-to-tail but rather would be V-shaped. In addition, the formation of pentamers/hexamers also appears to require specific constant region domains of IgA or IgM that are not present in IgG, although the requirements are less clear.The tail-pieces of IgM and IgA show a high degree of sequence identity and similarity across many different species (Fig.8 B). Human μtp and αtp used in these studies differ at seven positions (amino acids at positions 3, 4, 8, 11, 12, 13, and 14). Residue positions 3, 4, and 11 do not seem uniquely characteristic of either μtp or αtp. In contrast, the leucine at position 8 is present in all μtp except that of the gray opossum, whereas a conserved valine is observed at the corresponding position in the αtp. Also striking is the region containing residues 12–14. Both IgM and IgA contain a negatively charged residue at position 12 in all species analyzed except in ladyfish IgM. Whereas all species except the gray opossum contain a polar residue at position 13 of the μtp, the corresponding position in the αtp is hydrophobic. In addition, all species except for the Norway rat and marsupials, including opposum, contain another negatively charged residue at position 14 in the αtp but not in the μtp. It is tempting to speculate that these differences between the tail-pieces in the context of the various constant region domains contribute to the types of polymers formed and whether they associate with J chain.Figure 8Sequence alignment of IgM and IgA tail-pieces from various species. + represents the same amino acid as that of human IgM or IgA1 at that position. − represents a deletion at that position. *, §, ‡, and † indicate residues at positions 8, 12, 13, and 14, respectively, which contain conserved differences between the μtp and α tp across species. For the IgA tail-piece, the sequence is that of IgA1 unless otherwise indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In summary, we have shown that although the tail-pieces of both IgA and IgM can effect polymerization of Igs, the incorporation of J chain and the extent of polymerization is determined by additional structural motifs in the constant region domains. In addition, the incorporation of J chain into polymeric Igs is regulated not only by the amount of J chain available but also by structural features in the constant region domains as well as the tail-piece. Based on these findings, we suggest an alternative model for the structure of dimeric IgA in which the two IgA monomers interact noncovalently through their CH3 domains as well as through covalent interactions in the tail-piece. Antibodies consist of a basic four chain structure arranged to form two Fab arms and an Fc region. Although most Ig isotypes are secreted as monomers, IgM exists only as pentamers and hexamers, and IgA is found as both monomers and polymers of predominantly dimeric form. Both polymeric IgA and IgM are transported into external secretions due to their ability to bind the polymeric Ig receptor. Although all antibody-secreting cells produce J chain, it is incorporated only into polymeric Igs. Polymerization not only increases the avidity of Igs for antigen but also enhances effector functions, such as complement activation and binding to Fc receptors (1Smith R.I. Morrison S.L. Bio/Technology. 1994; 12: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 2Smith R.I. Coloma M.J. Morrison S.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2226-2236PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, understanding how polymerization is regulated and the requirements for polymer assembly is of great interest. Both IgA and IgM possess an 18-amino acid extension in the C terminus called the tail-piece (tp).1The conserved penultimate cysteine residue in the IgA and IgM tail-pieces has been demonstrated to be involved in polymerization (3Chapuis R.M. Koshland M.E. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 1320-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar,4Wiersma E.J. Chen F. Bazin R. Collins C. Painter R.H. Lemieux R. Shulman M.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1719-1726PubMed Google Scholar). Although the tail-pieces of IgA (αtp) and IgM (μtp) are similar in sequence, there are several differences (Fig. 1 A). Both tail-pieces contain an N-linked carbohydrate addition site, the presence of which is required for dimer formation in IgA (5Atkin J.D. Pleass R.J. Owens R.J. Woof J.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 156-159PubMed Google Scholar) and J chain incorporation and pentamer formation in IgM (4Wiersma E.J. Chen F. Bazin R. Collins C. Painter R.H. Lemieux R. Shulman M.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1719-1726PubMed Google Scholar). However, the structure and composition of the N-linked carbohydrates in the tail-pieces differ, suggesting differences in the accessibility of the glycans to processing by glycosyltransferases (6Mattu T.S. Pleass R.J. Willis A.C. Kilian M. Wormald M.R. Lellouch A.C. Rudd P.M. Woof J.M. Dwek R.A. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1991; 198: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The assembly of dimeric IgA is initiated with the formation of H2L2 monomer units through a pathway in which H + L → HL → H2L2 (8Chintalacharuvu K.R. Tavill A.S. Louis L.N. Vaerman J.P. Lamm M.E. Kaetzel C.S. Hepatol. 1994; 19: 162-173PubMed Google Scholar). The penultimate cysteine in the tail-piece of one α chain forms a disulfide bond with J chain, which in turn forms a disulfide bond with the α chain of a second monomeric subunit (5Atkin J.D. Pleass R.J. Owens R.J. Woof J.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 156-159PubMed Google Scholar, 9Davis A. Shulman M.J. Immunol.

Hoppe-Seyler. 1992; 373: 1255-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It was suggested that J chain was required for polymerization of Igs, and indeed, polymerization by IgA does not take place in cells lacking J chain (12Krugmann S. Pleass R.J. Atkin J.D. Woof J.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 244-249PubMed Google Scholar). However, although IgM pentamers contain J chain, IgM hexamers have been shown to lack J chain (9Davis A. Shulman M.J. Immunol. Today. 1989; 4 (127–128): 118-122Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, all four isotypes of recombinant human IgGs containing the μtp form polymers without associating with J chain (1Smith R.I. Morrison S.L. Bio/Technology. 1994; 12: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar,2Smith R.I. Coloma M.J. Morrison S.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2226-2236PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we explore the effects of the tail-pieces and associated constant region domains on the polymerization state of Igs and their interactions with J chain by placing the αtp and μtp in the context of human IgM, IgA1, and IgG2 constant regions, as well as generating IgA1/IgG2 and IgM/murine IgG2b domain-exchanged mutants. Although both the αtp and μtp can effect polymerization in all contexts, the types of polymers formed were determined by the structural context of the tail-pieces. Analysis of domain-exchanged mutants revealed that the formation predominantly of dimers requires not only the αtp but also the CH3 domain of IgA. Although all proteins containing the μtp formed primarily higher order polymers, there does appear to be some specificity because wild type IgM formed primarily pentamers, whereas IgM-αtp formed mainly hexamers, and the domain-exchanged protein μμγμ-μtp formed tetramers and hexamers. J chain was not found in association with all polymers, indicating that the tail-piece alone is insufficient for J chain incorporation. Studies using IgA1/IgG2 and IgM/murine IgG2b domain-exchanged proteins suggest that the covalent association of J chain with polymeric Igs is determined by the structural context of the tail-piece. In the case of IgA1, the CH3 domain, in addition to either the αtp or μtp, is required for incorporation of J chain, whereas IgM requires CH3, CH4, and the μtp for J chain incorporation. Therefore, although both IgM and IgA associate with J chain, the types of protein-protein interactions made between J chain and the Igs may differ, resulting in the formation of pentamers for IgM and dimers for IgA. In addition, mutating the tail-piece of IgA to that of IgM results in altered carbohydrate processing, polymer assembly, and J chain incorporation. DISCUSSIONIn contrast to IgG, IgA and IgM exist as polymeric immunoglobulins. However, polymeric IgA is secreted mainly as dimers, whereas IgM is secreted as pentamers and hexamers. An interesting question is what directs IgA to form predominantly dimers, whereas IgM forms pentamers/hexamers. Previous studies and the current investigation have shown that the addition of the αtp or μtp to the C terminus of IgM, IgA, or IgG is sufficient for the formation of polymers; however, the selective formation of dimers in those Igs containing the αtp and pentamers/hexamers in those containing the μtp was not observed (2Smith R.I. Coloma M.J. Morrison S.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2226-2236PubMed Google Scholar, 18Sørensen V. Sundvold V. Michaelsen T.E. Sandlie I. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3448-3455PubMed Google Scholar, 19Sørensen V. Rasmussen I.B. Norderhaug L. Natvig I. Michaelsen T.E. Sandlie I. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2858-2865PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the tail-pieces by themselves do not contain all of the information necessary for the formation of specific polymers.We have now used domain-exchanged proteins to define the contribution of the constant region domains to polymer assembly. Because the Ig constant region domains are “modular” in nature, we believe that exchanging the domains between different Ig isotypes would not result in dramatic changes to the overall three-dimensional structure of the Igs. However, the contribution of subtle structural changes in the interdomain regions to polymer assembly and J chain incorporation cannot be ruled out. The results of this investigation are summarized in Table II. Interestingly, we have found that the selective formation of dimers occurred only in the presence of both Cα3 and αtp, but efficient dimer assembly was observed only when both Cα2 and Cα3 were present. Mutation of the six amino acids around Cys414 in CH2 of IgA to those of IgM did not alter assembly (18Sørensen V. Sundvold V. Michaelsen T.E. Sandlie I. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3448-3455PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that other regions in Cα2 contribute to efficient dimer formation. Pentamer assembly seems to require Cμ3, Cμ4, and the μtp.Table IISummary of results using tail-piece and domain exchange mutantsTypes of polymers formedAssociation with J chainCα3-αtpDimers2-aMore efficient dimer formation occurs when Cα2 is also present.+Cα3-μtp2-bCarbohydrate processing is altered so that some glycans remain in the high mannose form.Pentamers/hexamers+Cγ3-αtpAll types−Cμ3-Cμ4-μtpPentamers+Cμ3-Cμ4-αtpHexamers−Cγ2-Cμ4-μtpTetramers and hexamers−Cγ3-μtpAll types−2-a More efficient dimer formation occurs when Cα2 is also present.2-b Carbohydrate processing is altered so that some glycans remain in the high mannose form. Open table in a new tab J chain has been shown to be necessary for the assembly of IgA dimers (20Brewer J.W. Corley R.B. Mol. Immunol. 1997; 34: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 21Fazel S. Wiersma E.J. Shulman M.J. Int. Immunol. 1997; 9: 1149-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We now show that in the presence of αtp, the requirements for J chain incorporation closely resemble the requirements for specific dimer formation, namely the presence Cα3. Molecules containing Cγ3-αtp as well as IgM-αtp did not associate with J chain.Although J chain is associated with IgM pentamers, it is not associated with IgM hexamers (22Randall T.D. King L.B. Corley R.B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 1971-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The polymerization state of IgM has been shown to be regulated by the amount of J chain synthesized in that increases in J chain production led to an increase in the secretion of pentamers (23Randall T.D. Parkhouse R.M. Corley R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 962-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, we have found that placing the tail-piece of IgA on IgM resulted in the secretion of predominantly hexamers that lack J chain, and replacement of Cμ3 with Cγ2 resulted in tetramers and hexamers that lack J chain. In these cases, tetramer and hexamer formation does not appear to reflect limiting amounts of J chain because wild type IgM produced by the same cells formed predominantly pentamers associated with J chain. In addition, the preferential formation of IgM-αtp hexamers does not appear to be an artifact of this expression system because Sørensen et al. (18Sørensen V. Sundvold V. Michaelsen T.E. Sandlie I. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3448-3455PubMed Google Scholar) have recently made the same observation in a different cell line, although they did not examine J chain incorporation.In pentameric IgM, J chain is presumed to bind to two monomers, functioning as a “clasp” to close the circle of monomers (23Randall T.D. Parkhouse R.M. Corley R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 962-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); in hexameric IgM, it is an additional monomer that closes this circle. It has been proposed that chaperones retain partially assembled IgM polymers in the endoplasmic reticulum (24Sitia R. Neuberger M. Alberini C. Bet P. Fra A. Valetti C. Williams G. Milstein C. Cell. 1990; 60: 781-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Changing the IgM tail-piece to that of IgA may abolish specific structural motifs that are needed to interact with these chaperones for efficient incorporation of J chain into IgM pentamers. Alternatively, the structure of the αtp may be such that it leads to preferential formation of hexamers due to changes in the accessibility and/or orientation of the penultimate cysteine involved in polymerization.The carbohydrate present on both J chain and the α and μ tail-pieces plays a role in polymerization. The carbohydrate in μtp has been shown to be required for J chain incorporation (4Wiersma E.J. Chen F. Bazin R. Collins C. Painter R.H. Lemieux R. Shulman M.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1719-1726PubMed Google Scholar), and elimination of the carbohydrate from either J chain or αtp leads to decreased dimer formation (5Atkin J.D. Pleass R.J. Owens R.J. Woof J.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 156-159PubMed Google Scholar, 12Krugmann S. Pleass R.J. Atkin J.D. Woof J.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 244-249PubMed Google Scholar) and increased formation of higher order polymers (25Chuang P.D. Morrison S.L. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 724-732PubMed Google Scholar). The N-glycan on the αtp of IgA1 has been reported to be predominantly a triantennary complex oligosaccharide (6Mattu T.S. Pleass R.J. Willis A.C. Kilian M. Wormald M.R. Lellouch A.C. Rudd P.M. Woof J.M. Dwek R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2260-2272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), whereas IgM has been reported to have a high mannose carbohydrate in the tail-piece (7Wormald M.R. Wooten E.W. Bazzo R. Edge C.J. Feinstein A. Rademacher T.W. Dwek R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These differences in carbohydrate structure suggest that the two tail-pieces differ in their accessibility to processing by glycosyltransferases. Indeed, we found that IgA-μtp is heterogeneous in its glycosylation and contains glycans that can be removed by Endo H digestion, whereas all of the glycans on wild type IgA are Endo H-resistant. Polymeric IgM assembly is thought to occur through the stepwise addition of HL half-molecules, presumably limiting the accessibility of the tail-piece carbohydrate to processing by the glycosyltransferases (19Sørensen V. Rasmussen I.B. Norderhaug L. Natvig I. Michaelsen T.E. Sandlie I. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2858-2865PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that theN-linked carbohydrate in the tail-piece of IgA-μtp is similar to that of the tail-piece glycan of IgM suggests that IgA-μtp is also assembled such that its tail-piece glycan is not available for processing by the glycosyltransferases. These differences in carbohydrate processing suggest that changing the tail-piece alters the overall three-dimensional structure of the Igs, which affects polymer assembly and incorporation of J chain.Currently, there are no crystal structures available for IgA and IgM, although a theoretical model of monomeric IgA has been published recently (6Mattu T.S. Pleass R.J. Willis A.C. Kilian M. Wormald M.R. Lellouch A.C. Rudd P.M. Woof J.M. Dwek R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2260-2272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Previous models have suggested that two IgA monomers interact through the tail-pieces to form dimeric IgA, which lies tail-to-tail (12Krugmann S. Pleass R.J. Atkin J.D. Woof J.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 244-249PubMed Google Scholar). However, our studies indicate that both Cα3 and αtp are important in the assembly of dimers, suggesting that two IgA monomers may be interacting noncovalently through their CH3 domains in addition to forming covalent associations in the tail-piece. In this case, the structure of dimeric IgA would not be a linear molecule of two monomers lying tail-to-tail but rather would be V-shaped. In addition, the formation of pentamers/hexamers also appears to require specific constant region domains of IgA or IgM that are not present in IgG, although the requirements are less clear.The tail-pieces of IgM and IgA show a high degree of sequence identity and similarity across many different species (Fig.8 B). Human μtp and αtp used in these studies differ at seven positions (amino acids at positions 3, 4, 8, 11, 12, 13, and 14). Residue positions 3, 4, and 11 do not seem uniquely characteristic of either μtp or αtp. In contrast, the leucine at position 8 is present in all μtp except that of the gray opossum, whereas a conserved valine is observed at the corresponding position in the αtp. Also striking is the region containing residues 12–14. Both IgM and IgA contain a negatively charged residue at position 12 in all species analyzed except in ladyfish IgM. Whereas all species except the gray opossum contain a polar residue at position 13 of the μtp, the corresponding position in the αtp is hydrophobic.

Whereas all species except the gray opossum contain a polar residue at position 13 of the μtp, the corresponding position in the αtp is hydrophobic. In addition, all species except for the Norway rat and marsupials, including opposum, contain another negatively charged residue at position 14 in the αtp but not in the μtp. It is tempting to speculate that these differences between the tail-pieces in the context of the various constant region domains contribute to the types of polymers formed and whether they associate with J chain. In summary, we have shown that although the tail-pieces of both IgA and IgM can effect polymerization of Igs, the incorporation of J chain and the extent of polymerization is determined by additional structural motifs in the constant region domains. In addition, the incorporation of J chain into polymeric Igs is regulated not only by the amount of J chain available but also by structural features in the constant region domains as well as the tail-piece. Based on these findings, we suggest an alternative model for the structure of dimeric IgA in which the two IgA monomers interact noncovalently through their CH3 domains as well as through covalent interactions in the tail-piece.

We generated and purified soluble recombinant fragments of ActA and assessed their ability to interact with the acidic phospholipids phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, both implicated in the regulation of actin polymerization. Purified ActA consisted of biologically active, elongated molecules with an α-helix and β-sheet content of 11 and 32%, respectively. In the presence of either phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate or phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, but not phosphatidylcholine, ActA molecules underwent a structural change that raised the α-helix content to 19% and lowered the β-sheet content to 27%. Co-sedimentation experiments with phosphatidylcholine vesicles containing different acidic phospholipids demonstrated that ActA binds preferentially to D-3 phosphoinositides. The D-3 phosphoinositide binding activity was mapped to a small subregion in the N-terminal domain of ActA. This subregion comprised 19 amino acids and showed homology to cecropins. In addition, we found that amino acids 33 to 74 of ActA mediated actin binding by the whole, folded ActA molecule. These findings shed new light on ActA function.

One of the mechanisms underlying protrusion formation is directed actin assembly which is initiated by a bacterial surface protein called ActA. With the help of ActA the bacteria induce localized actin assembly at the rear end of the bacterial body thereby generating a force that propels the bacteria forward through the host cell cytoplasm. This characteristic actin-based motility is the reason forListeria's use as a model system to study actin assembly of eucaryotic cells (for review, see Refs. 1Cossart P. Lecuit M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3797-3806Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar and 2Beckerle M.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 741-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). ActA is a 610-amino acid protein with a N-terminal signal sequence of 29 amino acids, which is cleaved off after transport through the bacterial membrane, and a C-terminal membrane-spanning sequence which anchors ActA to the bacterial membrane (3Domann E.

Microbiol. 1995; 17: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) for bacterially induced actin polymerization and movement. ActA deletion mutants are able to invade cells, albeit at a reduced rate, and multiply in the cytoplasm. However, these mutants are unable to induce actin assembly, and therefore cannot move nor spread from cell to cell. Furthermore, in a mouse model of infection these mutants are almost avirulent (4Kocks C. Gouin E. Tabouret M. Berche P. Ohayon H. Cossart P. Cell. 1992; 68: 521-531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar,7Gouin E. Dehoux P. Mengaud J. Kocks C. Cossart P. Infect. Immunol. 1995; 63: 2729-2737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ActA protein has been shown to contain at least three different functional domains: an N-terminal (amino acids 1 to 234), a proline-rich, central (amino acids 235 to 393), and a C-terminal domain (amino acids 394 to 610). When expressed in eucaryotic cells the first two domains exert distinct effects on the cytoskeleton (8Friederich E. Gouin E. Hellio R. Kocks C. Cossart P. Louvard D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2731-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), while the C-terminal domain, besides anchoring the protein in the bacterial membrane, serves as a spacer traversing the cell wall. The central domain of ActA harbors a 4-fold repeated proline-rich motif with the amino acid core consensus (E/D)FPPPPX(D/E). This FP4 motif is also present in two focal adhesion proteins, zyxin and vinculin, which in this respect can be regarded as eucaryotic homologs of ActA (9Niebuhr K. Ebel F. Frank R. Reinhard M.

Commun. 1997; 231: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). FP4 motifs represent docking sites for Ena/VASP1 homology 1 domains, carried by proteins of the Ena/VASP family which are constituents of focal adhesions plaques (9Niebuhr K. Ebel F. Frank R. Reinhard M. Domann E. Carl U.D. Walter U. Gertler F.B. Wehland J. Chakraborty T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5433-5444Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Ena/VASP proteins bind to F-actin (11Laurent V. Loisel T.P. Harbeck B. Wehmann A. Gröbe L. Jockusch B.M. Wehland J. Gertler F.B. Carlier M.F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1245-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) and recruit profilin, an actin-binding protein that can promote actin filament elongation (12Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. Cell. 1993; 75: 1007-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Deletion of the proline-rich central domain of ActA strongly reduces but does not completely abolish motility suggesting that this domain acts as an efficient accelerator of actin filament assembly (9Niebuhr K. Ebel F. Frank R. Reinhard M. Domann E. Carl U.D. Walter U. Gertler F.B. Wehland J. Chakraborty T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5433-5444Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 13Lasa I. David V. Gouin E.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 647-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of ActA is sufficient to mediate bacterial motility in cytoplasmic extracts when overexpressed inListeria mutants deleted for actA (13Lasa I. David V. Gouin E. Marchand J.B. Cossart P. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 425-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 15Lasa I. Gouin E. Goethals M. Vancompernolle K. David V. Vandekerckhove J. Cossart P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1531-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This domain has been implicated in facilitating actin nucleation by interacting with the Arp2/3 complex, an evolutionarily conserved protein complex consisting of 7 to 8 polypeptides. A mixture of purified ActA and the Arp2/3 complex is an efficient nucleator of actin filament formation, whereas the Arp2/3 complex alone nucleates actin only weakly (16Welch M.D. Rosenblatt J. Skoble J. Portnoy D.A. Mitchison T.J. Science. 1998; 281: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). In addition to its actin nucleation activity, the Arp2/3 complex is responsible for actin filament capping and branching by binding to the pointed ends and to the sides of actin filaments, a property that may account for its occurrence throughout theListeria actin tails (17Welch M.D. Iwamatsu A. Mitchison T.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 18Mullins R.D. Heuser J.A. Pollard T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6181-6186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). ActA alone shows no actin nucleation activity nor has it been possible to demonstrate that ActA interacts with actin in other ways (16Welch M.D. Rosenblatt J. Skoble J. Portnoy D.A. Mitchison T.J. Science. 1998; 281: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 19Tilney L.G. Connelly P.S. Portnoy D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2979-2988Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The details of the mechanism by which ActA promotes actin polymerization in conjunction with the Arp2/3 complex are not yet clear. It is also not known whether interaction of ActA with the Arp2/3 complex is sufficient for ActA-mediated initiation of actin-based motility in vivo, or whether other factors may be involved. Therefore, in order to improve our understanding of ActA function, we have purified and characterized soluble variants of the ActA molecule. Using these ActA variants we have addressed the question whether ActA might interact with phosphoinositides which have been implicated as central mediators of actin assembly (20Toker A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) and have reinvestigated whether ActA might directly interact with actin. Molecular cloning, SDS-gel electrophoresis, immunoblotting, and amino acid sequencing were carried out according to standard procedures (21.Google Scholar, 22Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Ploegh H.L.

Chemicals used were purest grade and purchased from Merck or Fluka unless otherwise specified. Phospholipids were obtained from Sigma or BIOMOL. Pure phospholipids or mixtures of PC and acidic phospholipids were resuspended in water and sonicated on ice with a Braun Labsonic U sonicator at maximum power until the turbidity of the solution completely disappeared. The vesicles or micelles were then stored frozen as aliquots at −80 °C and rigorously vortexed after thawing. Data processing and figure preparation were carried out using Canvas 3.5.3 and 5.0, Photoshop 3.0, and Cricket Graph III. Fragments of the actA gene were amplified using plasmid pactA3 (4Kocks C.

The 246- and 225-base pair PCR products were restricted with BsrI and ClaI and ligated with the 1.87-kilobase HindIII/BsrI fragment of pactA3 into pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene), resulting in pactA28 and -51, respectively. Histidine-tagged N-ActA: a fragment of theactA gene was amplified using pactA3 as template and primer pair KO17/18. The PCR product was restricted with MfeI andClaI and ligated into the 3.2-kilobaseMfeI/ClaI fragment of pactA28, resulting in pactA34. Histidine-tagged P-ActA: a fragment of the actAgene was amplified using pactA3 as template and primer pair KO19/20. Histidine-tagged C-ActA: a fragment of the actA gene was amplified using pactA28 as template and primer pair KO15/16. After restriction with Sau96I and ClaI the PCR products for P- or C-ActA and the 0.4-kilobaseHindIII/Sau96I fragment of pactA28 were ligated into pBluescriptII KS+, resulting in pactA35 and -32, respectively. Histidine-tagged ActAΔ41–56 was constructed by performing a first round of two separate PCR reactions with pactA1 (4Kocks C. Gouin E. Tabouret M. Berche P. Ohayon H. Cossart P. Cell. 1992; 68: 521-531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar) as template and primer pairs KO29/33 and KO30/34. The two PCR products were then mixed and used as template for a second PCR with primer pair KO29/30. This fragment was restricted with MfeI and SphI and ligated to the 4517-base pair MfeI-SphI fragment of pactA28, resulting in pactA43. pactA28, -34, -32, -35, -43, and -51 were each restricted with BamHI and SalI and the inserts were ligated into pAT18 containing the promoter sequence of an exoprotease of Streptococcus cremoris in theEcoRI site (see Ref. 5Kocks C.

L. monocytogenes LO28ΔactA4 harboring plasmids coding for soluble recombinant fragments of ActA was grown in 50 ml of brain heart infusion broth (Oxoid) containing 50 μg/ml erythromycin to an A 590 nm of 1, snap-frozen in 20% glycerol, and stored at −80 °C. Aliquots were thawed and then diluted 50-fold in brain heart infusion broth (Oxoid) supplemented with 50 μg/ml erythromycin and 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0. Cells were cultivated for 16 h at 37 °C, then pelleted by centrifugation. Protein in the supernatant was precipitated at 4 °C with ammonium sulfate to 45 to 50% saturation, depending on the ActA variant. The pellet was resuspended in 50 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 250 μg/ml PefaBloc (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), dialyzed against 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, and sterilized by filtration (Serum Acrodisc, Gelman). Histidine-tagged ActA fragments: the filtrate was loaded on a Ni-NTA superflow (Qiagen) column (gel volume: 5 ml) equilibrated with loading buffer (300 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0) followed by 10 ml of wash buffer (500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 50 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.0) and eluted in 10 ml with a gradient of 0 to 250 mm imidazole in loading buffer. ActA without the histidine tag: after concentration to 5 ml with Centricon 10 concentrators (Amicon) and buffer exchange to 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5 (PD10 column, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), the protein was applied to a MonoQ HR 5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), equilibrated with 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and eluted with a NaCl gradient over 15 ml from 0.05 to 1 m. All fragments: fractions containing ActA fragments were pooled, concentrated using Centricon 10 (Amicon), and applied to a Superose 6HR 30/column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), equilibrated with PBS (137 mmNaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 18 mmNa2PO4, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.2) or CD buffer (100 mm sodium fluoride, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.1), or 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8. Fractions containing ActA were pooled and aliquots stored at −80 °C. The correct processing of ActA, N-ActA, P-ActA, and C-ActA was verified by N-terminal amino acid sequencing after centrifugation onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. GST, histidine-tagged GST, and GST-ActA fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain NB42 and purified as described (21.Google Scholar, 23Thain A. Gaston K. Jenkins O. Clarke A.R. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 209-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). PD10 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used for buffer exchange. Histidine-tagged GST and GST-ActA fusion proteins were purified by metal chelate chromatography as described above. Histidine-tagged GST was additionally purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose. We noted that GST-ActA136–235, 184–235, and 184–202 had an increased tendency to precipitate compared with the other GST fusion proteins. Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine γ-globulin as standard. Molar ratios were calculated by assuming proteins to be monomeric. Cytoplasmic extracts prepared from non-adherently growing HeLa S3 cells by standard procedures (21.Google Scholar) were a gift of Michael Leichter and Gerald Thiel. 1 ml of cytoplasmic extract corresponding to 2.2 × 108 cells was precleared with 100 μl of Ni-NTA Superflow beads (Qiagen) equilibrated in PBS/Tween (PBS supplemented with 0.2% Tween) for 30 min at 4 °C. 10 μl of a 50% slurry of Ni-NTA Superflow beads equilibrated with binding buffer (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0) were loaded with 7.5 μg of the corresponding ActA fragment. The beads were then incubated with 250 μl of the precleared extract for 30 min at 4 °C and after 4 washes with 1 ml of PBS/Tween, bound proteins were eluted with 20 μl of imidazole-elution buffer (500 mmimidazole, 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0). Eluate corresponding to 12.5 μl of cell extract was electrophoresed through a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by Western blotting. Blots were developed with a mouse monoclonal anti-human VASP antibody (Transduction Laboratories). To control equal loading of the beads eluate corresponding to 100 μl of extract was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The presence of the respective ActA fragment was confirmed after Coomassie Blue staining. Interphasic extracts of Xenopus eggs prepared as described (24Beyert N. Reichenberger S. Peters M. Hartung M. Gottlich B. Goedecke W. Vielmetter W. Pfeiffer P.

Extracts were supplemented with 3 μm G-actin-Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes), 1 mm MgATP, and 10 μm creatine phosphate (together less than 15% of total volume). Recombinant soluble forms of ActA were coated on Ni-NTA Superflow beads as described above. After two washes with 100 μl of Xenopusbuffer (100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 50 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.7) the supernatant was removed. 1 μl of bead slurry was incubated with 10 μl of Xenopus egg cytoplasmic extract. After incubation for 15–30 min at room temperature, the mixture was transferred to a microscope slide and observed under a fluorescence microscope (Axiophot, Zeiss; objective ×10) and photographed on Fuji PROVIA RHP 135 film 400 Åsa under identical exposure conditions. Equal loading of Ni-NTA beads was controlled by loading beads as described above followed by protein elution with imidazole/elution buffer. Eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and protein amounts determined by densitometric scanning of the Coomassie Blue-stained gel. G-actin was prepared as described (25Ruppert C. Kroschewski R. Bähler M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1393-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Ni-NTA Superflow beads were loaded with ActA fragments as described above, washed twice with PBS-blocking buffer (PBS supplemented with 3% bovine serum albumin (fraction V; Sigma), and 0.2% teleostean gelatin (Sigma)) and the supernatant was removed. Equal loading of the beads was controlled as described above. 1 μl of bead slurry was mixed with 10 μl of PBS blocking buffer supplemented with 1 mm MgATP. G-actin, of which 50% was labeled with Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes) was added to a final concentration of 4 μm and then the mixture immediately transferred to a microscope slide. The samples were observed under a fluorescence microscope (Axiophot, Zeiss; objective ×10 or 40) and results recorded within 1 h as described (5Kocks C. Marchand J.B. Gouin E. d'Hauteville H.

After centrifugation in the presence or absence of 4 μm F-actin for 15 min at 245,000 × g at 4 °C, the pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, and equal amounts of supernatants and resuspended pellets were analyzed on a 12% SDS gel. Actin polymerization assays were performed as described (26Ruhnau K. Gaertner A. Wegner A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μm G-actin, of which 5% was labeled with 7-chloro-4-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol at lysine 373, was polymerized in 100 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.16 mm CaCl2, 0.4 mm ATP, 2.4 mm NaN3, 6.6 mm sodium phosphate, and 4 mmtriethanolamine/HCl, pH 7.2, in the presence or absence of 0.2 or 2 μm ActA. The excitation wavelength was 480 nm. Light emission was recorded every 60 s at 540 nm over a time period of 120 min. 1 to 2 mg/ml protein in 20 μl was loaded onto a Superose 6 PC 3.2/30 column attached to a SMART system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Sedimentation velocity at a rotor speed of 56,000 rpm and sedimentation equilibrium of ActA (0.2 to 2 mg/ml in either PBS, pH 7.2, or CD buffer, pH 7.1, or 0.1m Tris, pH 8.0) was carried out at 20 °C in a Beckman XLA analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with absorption optics (Ralston, 19) in 12-mm double sector cells (Epon). For sedimentation equilibrium runs, cells were filled to 2–3 mm above the FC-43 bottom fluid. Depending on the size of the molecular masses, different rotor speeds were used: first 8,000 or 9,600 rpm for the higher molecular weight species and, after equilibrium was achieved, the rotor speed was raised to 14,000 rpm for determination of mass of the lower molecular weight species. Molecular masses (M r) were calculated using a floating baseline computer program that adjusted the baseline absorbance to obtain the linear fit of ln A versus r 2 (A, absorbance,r, radial distance). An assumed partial specific volume of 0.73 cm3/g was used. The density and viscosity of the buffer were corrected to 20 °C water using the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 70th edition. The Stokes radius (r s ) and the frictional ratio (f/f 0) of ActA were calculated using the following equations, rs=M(1−V¯p)Ns20,w6πηandf/f0=rs33MV̄4πNEquation 1 where N is the Avogadro's number; M the mass of 1 mol of particle; s 20, w, the sedimentation coefficient; - V, the partial specific volume; ρ, the density; and η, the viscosity of the solution. Spectra were obtained with proteins in CD buffer, pH 7.1, at a concentration of 0.1 to 0.45 mg/ml. Phospholipids were used at a final concentration of 150 μm. Solid guanidine HCl was added to a final concentration of 6 m so that the protein to be tested in 6 m guanidine HCl as well as the control were in half-concentrated CD buffer. CD spectra were recorded at 25 °C with a Jasco 715 CD spectropolarimeter in a thermostatted quartz cell of 1-mm optical path length between 186 and 250 nm or between 212 and 250 nm at 10 nm/min. For each measurement the mean values of 3 spectra were taken to improve the signal to noise ratio. Molar ellipticities [Θ] were calculated on the basis of a mean amino acid residue molecular mass of 110 Da. Protein concentrations were determined by UV spectroscopy on the basis of calculated extinction coefficients for denaturated proteins, which were corrected for native proteins by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm in the presence and absence of 6m guanidine HCl (27Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). To exclude a potential influence of a minor pH change due to phospholipid addition, a CD spectrum of ActA was recorded at pH 6.8 instead of pH 7.1; no significant change of the CD spectrum was observed. Limited proteolysis using chymotrypsin, trypsin, endoprotease Lys-C, Asp-N, Glu-C, Arg-C, elastase, subtilisin, pepsin, thermolysin, papain, proteinase K, and plasmin was carried out according to standard procedures (22Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Ploegh H.L. Seicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Chanda V.B. Current Protocols in Protein Science. John Wiley & Sons, New York1995Google Scholar). For proteolysis with chymotrypsin or endoprotease Glu-C, 20 μm ActA was incubated in 0.1 mTris, pH 8.0, with varying amounts of proteases (sequencing grade; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in the absence or presence of 333 μm PI(4,5)P2 or PI(3,4,5)P3micelles or PC vesicles in a 3-μl volume for the indicated times at 25 °C. The final molar ratio of ActA to phospholipid was 1:16. The reactions were stopped by addition of 0.3 μl of 10 mg/ml PefaBloc and 0.8 μl of 5× Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were electrophoresed through 8–25% SDS-polyacrylamide gels using a PHAST System (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For Western blotting, 2 to 250 ng of the samples were electrophoresed through 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blots were developed using peptide specific antibodies raised against the 18 N-terminal amino acids of ActA (A18K) (7Gouin E. Dehoux P. Mengaud J. Kocks C. Cossart P. Infect. Immunol. 1995; 63: 2729-2737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or the second FP4 motif in ActA (Y21T) (5Kocks C. Marchand J.B. Gouin E. d'Hauteville H. Sansonetti P.J. Carlier M.F. Cossart P. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 413-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) or mouse monoclonal anti-histidine-tag antibody 13/45/31 (Dianova). For preparative purposes the limited proteolysis reactions were scaled up to contain 500 μg of ActA. Proteins and fragments corresponding to 500 pmol were blotted or centrifuged onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes and sequenced using an Applied Biosystems sequencer model 492 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Co-sedimentation assays were performed according to Harlanet al. (28Harlan J.E. Hajduk P.J. Yoon H.S. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1994; 371: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: the samples were in 66 mm sodium fluoride, 13 mm sodium phosphate,"
https://openalex.org/W2077694135,"Internalization is an important mechanism regulating the agonist-dependent responses of G-protein-coupled receptors. The internalization of the M2 muscarinic cholinergic receptors (mAChR) in HEK293 cells has been demonstrated to occur by an unknown mechanism that is independent of arrestins and dynamin. In this study we examined various aspects of the trafficking of the M2mAChR in HEK293 cells to characterize this unknown pathway of internalization. Internalization of the M2 mAChR was rapid and extensive, but prolonged incubation with agonist did not lead to appreciable down-regulation (a decrease in total receptor number) of the receptors. Recovery of M2 mAChRs to the cell surface following agonist-mediated internalization was a very slow process that contained protein synthesis-dependent and -independent components. The protein synthesis-dependent component of the recovery of receptors to the cell surface did not appear to reflect a requirement for synthesis of new receptors, as no changes in total receptor number were observed either in the presence or absence of cycloheximide. Phosphorylation of the M2 mAChR did not appear to influence the rate or extent of the recovery of receptors to the cell surface, as the recovery of a phosphorylation-deficient mutant M2 mAChR, the N,CAla-8 mutant, was similar to the recovery of the wild type M2 mAChR. Finally, the constitutive, nonagonist-dependent internalization and recycling of the M2 mAChR was very slow and also contained protein synthesis-dependent and -independent components, suggesting that a similar pathway controls the recovery from agonist-dependent and -independent internalization.

G-protein-coupled receptor β2adrenergic receptor propylbenzilylcholine mustard carbachol [3H]N-methylscopolamine [3H] quinuclidinyl benzilate phosphate-buffered saline muscarinic cholinergic receptor G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 are heptahelical membrane receptors that mediate cellular responses to various stimuli such as hormones and neurotransmitters. Stimulation of GPCRs by their agonists results in activation of heterotrimeric G-proteins leading to the regulation of a variety of signal transduction events in the cell. One of the major mechanisms modulating the cellular response to agonists is regulation of the GPCRs themselves. There are multiple processes involved in the regulation of GPCRs in response to agonist stimulation, and these processes are very complex and not well understood (for reviews see Refs. 1Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar and 2Bunemann M. Hosey M.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 517: 5-23Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Desensitization of GPCRs is believed to occur very rapidly following their activation by agonist. Agonist stimulation leads to phosphorylation of GPCRs by specific G-protein-coupled receptor kinases on serine and threonine residues (1Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar, 2Bunemann M. Hosey M.M. J. Physiol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 18125-18131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation then allows for interaction of the GPCRs with proteins termed arrestins (4Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). Arrestin binding is believed to cause desensitization by uncoupling the receptors from their G-proteins, thus preventing further signaling by the receptors (3Krupnick J.G. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18125-18131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Following receptor G-protein uncoupling many GPCRs are removed from the cell surface by a process known as receptor internalization or endocytosis. For some receptors, such as the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR), arrestin binding to the receptors also serves to target the receptors to clathrin-coated pits for internalization (5Ferguson S.S. Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 6Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). This function is dependent on the C termini of nonvisual arrestins, which contain a clathrin-binding domain (7Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15017-15022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). This pathway of internalization has been demonstrated to be dependent on the hydrolysis of GTP by the GTPase dynamin, which is believed to cause fission of the endocytic vesicles from the plasma membrane (8Herskovits J.S. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 565-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The roles of internalization in desensitization of GPCRs are not well understood. It has been demonstrated that internalization serves to allow for resensitization of certain GPCRs, such as the β2AR (9Pippig S. Andexinger S. Lohse M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 666-676PubMed Google Scholar, 10Zhang J. Barak L.S. Winkler K.E. Caron M.G. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27005-27014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Following their internalization, β2ARs are delivered to endosomes, where a specific GPCR phosphatase associates with and dephosphorylates the receptors (11Krueger K.M. Daaka Y. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). After the receptors have been dephosphorylated and “resensitized,” they are then recycled to the plasma membrane where they are once again capable of responding to agonist stimulation (9Pippig S. Andexinger S. Lohse M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 666-676PubMed Google Scholar, 10Zhang J. Barak L.S. Winkler K.E. Caron M.G. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27005-27014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In contrast, it has been demonstrated that internalization served to prolong desensitization of the M4 mAChR (12Bogatkewitsch G.S. Lenz W. Jakobs K.H. Van Koppen C.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 424-429PubMed Google Scholar). Down-regulation of GPCRs, a decrease in the total number of receptors in a cell, is another type of regulation observed following activation of GPCRs (13Bohm S.K. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). The mechanisms and functions of down-regulation are not well understood for most GPCRs. It is possible that down-regulation serves to decrease the responsiveness of a cell to a certain stimulus by decreasing the total number of receptors present in the cell. Down-regulation also serves to terminate signaling and to remove receptors that are only activated once, such as the protease-activated receptors in mammalian cells and the pheromone receptors in yeast (14Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 15Hein L. Ishii K. Coughlin S.R. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol.

A. 1998; 95: 13698-13702Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Following activation, these receptors are internalized and targeted for degradation rather than being recycled to the cell surface. The M2 mAChR is a member of the GPCR superfamily that is responsible for various physiologically important regulatory functions in tissues such as heart, smooth muscle, and brain (17Gomeza J. Shannon H. Kostenis E. Felder C. Zhang L. Brodkin J. Grinberg A. Sheng H. Wess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1692-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the agonist-dependent internalization of the M2 mAChR expressed in HEK293 cells occurs through a novel pathway that has yet to be identified (18Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Xu Y.

The agonist-dependent internalization of the M2mAChR by the endogenous machinery in HEK293 cells is independent of arrestins and dynamin (19Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Gurevich V.V. Lee K.B. Ptasienski J.A. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23682-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Agonist-dependent phosphorylation of the M2 mAChR does appear to play a key role in the internalization of these receptors, as phosphorylation-deficient mutants exhibit a reduction in the rate and extent of internalization (20Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14152-14158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In this report we examined characteristics of the trafficking of the M2 mAChR in HEK293 cells to further define the properties of the novel pathway responsible for the agonist-dependent internalization of the M2 mAChR and its role in receptor regulation. We observed that the recovery of M2 mAChRs to the cell surface following agonist treatment was a slow process that contained both protein synthesis-dependent and -independent components. We also demonstrated that recovery to the cell surface was not modulated by receptor phosphorylation and that the M2mAChR does not appreciably down regulate in HEK293 cells. Finally we found that the constitutive, nonagonist-dependent internalization and recycling of the M2 mAChR in HEK293 cells does occur and was also very slow and contained both protein synthesis-dependent and -independent components. Cell culture reagents were purchased from Mediatech, Inc. (Herndon, VA). G418 was purchased from Agri-bio, Inc. (North Miami, FL). The muscarinic receptor antagonists [3H]N-methylscopolamine ([3H]NMS) and [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB) were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Propylbenzilylcholine mustard (PBCM) was a generous gift from Dr. J. M. Young (Cambridge, UK). Other reagents were purchased from Sigma. HEK293 cells stably expressing the wild type M2 mAChR or the N,CAla-8 mutant have been described previously (20Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14152-14158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and were used for all experiments described within. The receptor expression levels were as follows: cell-surface M2 mAChRs or N,CAla-8, 200–300 fmol of receptor/mg of protein; total cellular M2 mAChRs or N,CAla-8, 400–600 fmol of receptor/mg of protein. The internalization assay was performed as described (19Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Gurevich V.V. Lee K.B. Ptasienski J.A. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23682-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) by assessing the observed change in the number of M2 mAChRs located at the cell surface as determined by the binding of a radiolabeled, hydrophilic antagonist, [3H]NMS, which cannot cross cellular membranes. Down-regulation assays were performed by assessing the observed change in the total number of M2 mAChRs as determined by the binding of a radiolabeled, hydrophobic antagonist, [3H]QNB, which is able to cross cellular membranes and bind to all receptors in the cell. HEK293 cells stably transfected with the M2 mAChR were passed from 100% confluent 100-mm plates to 60-mm plates at a 1:5 or 1:6 dilution. Cells were then grown to confluency in the 60-mm plates before use. The cells were incubated with carbamylcholine (CCh) and any other drugs as indicated for the specified times. Unless otherwise specified, the concentration of CCh was 1 mm, and cycloheximide was used at 20 μg/ml. At the end of the incubation time, cells were washed 5 times with 3 ml of ice-cold PBS. Cells were then resuspended in ice-cold HEPES-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:F12 and subjected to radioligand binding with saturating concentrations of [3H]NMS (1.0–2.0 nm) for 2 h at 4 °C or [3H]QNB (1.0 nm) for 90 min at 37 °C. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 10 μm atropine. Protein assays were performed on an aliquot of cells from each plate to control for differences in cell density. Data were expressed as a percentage of the [3H]NMS or [3H]QNB binding observed in untreated cells. The recovery assay was performed by observing the reappearance of receptors at the cell surface using the hydrophilic antagonist [3H]NMS following agonist-induced internalization. Cells were incubated with CCh +/- cycloheximide for the indicated times followed by washing 5 times with 3 ml PBS. Fresh medium +/- cycloheximide was added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. At the end of the incubation time, binding of [3H]NMS was performed as described above. Data for the recovery of receptors to the cell surface were expressed as a percentage of the [3H]NMS binding observed in cells that had not been exposed to carbachol. Thus, in the recovery experiments, the zero time point represents the amount of receptors remaining at the cell surface after the indicated time of exposure to carbachol. For measurement of total receptor number, [3H]QNB was used as described in the down-regulation protocol. Muscarinic receptors at the plasma membrane were irreversibly alkylated with the muscarinic receptor antagonist PBCM. The irreversibly acting form of PBCM, the aziridinium ion, was prepared as described previously (21Young J.M. Hiley R. Burgen A.S. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1972; 24: 950-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). PBCM (10 mm in ethanol) was diluted in PBS to 100 μm and incubated for 1 h at room temperature to allow it to cyclize. The reaction was stopped by diluting the PBCM to 10 nm in PBS. The activated PBCM was then kept on ice until used. Activated PBCM was used within 2 h of activation to prevent inactivation. HEK293 cells stably transfected with the M2mAChR were washed with PBS followed by incubation with activated PBCM (10 nm) for 30 min at room temperature. The PBCM was then removed, and the cells were washed with PBS containing 1 mmsodium thiosulfate to quench any residual, unreacted PBCM. HEK293 cells stably expressing the M2 mAChR were either untreated or pretreated with cycloheximide for 2 h, then alkylated with activated PBCM, washed with PBS containing sodium thiosulfate, and reincubated in fresh medium +/- cycloheximide for the indicated times. Cell-surface and total receptor levels were then determined through incubation with [3H]NMS or [3H]QNB as described in the receptor internalization and down-regulation assay methods. We initially sought to examine whether the M2 mAChR down regulates (undergoes a net decrease in total cellular receptor number) in response to prolonged agonist exposure when expressed in HEK293 cells. It has been previously demonstrated that other GPCRs, such as the β2AR, down regulate in HEK293 cells (22Gagnon A.W. Kallal L. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6976-6981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). However, because the pathway of internalization of the M2 mAChR in HEK293 cells differs from that of the β2AR (19Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Gurevich V.V. Lee K.B. Ptasienski J.A. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23682-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether the M2 mAChR down regulates as the β2AR does or whether it differs from the β2AR in this aspect as well. For these studies we used a cell line of HEK293 cells stably expressing the M2 mAChR (18Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Xu Y. Witt-Enderby P. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29004-29011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In this cell line, 50–60% of the receptors are expressed on the cell surface, whereas the remainder are present in an intracellular compartment. In previous studies, we demonstrated that the internalization of the M2 mAChR is very extensive and rapid in this cell line (18Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Xu Y. Witt-Enderby P. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29004-29011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Approximately 80% of the cell-surface receptors were internalized within 5–10 min of CCh treatment (Fig. 1 A). In this study we asked if the rapid loss in cell-surface receptor number was accompanied by a loss in total receptor number. When the total (cell surface and intracellular) receptor number was determined by the binding of the cell permeable antagonist, [3H]QNB, following prolonged CCh treatment for up to 8 h, only a small change in total receptor number was observed. In other experiments, we also observed only minimal down-regulation after a 24-h treatment with CCh (not shown). Thus the M2 mAChR did not down regulate substantially in response to agonist treatment when expressed in HEK293 cells. Because the M2 mAChR did not down regulate but did rapidly internalize, we next sought to examine the characteristics of the recovery of M2 mAChRs to the cell surface following agonist pretreatment. After treatment of the M2 mAChR-HEK293 cells with CCh for 30 min, the cells were washed with PBS and placed in fresh medium without CCh for various periods of time. The reappearance (“recovery”) of receptors at the cell surface following agonist pretreatment was very slow, requiring nearly 4 h to recover to a new steady state in which cell-surface receptor density was equivalent to approximately 80% of untreated cell-surface receptor levels (Fig.2 A). Treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide showed an interesting pattern of recovery (Fig. 2 A). In the presence of cycloheximide the initial phase of recovery through the first 2 h was identical to cells not treated with cycloheximide. However, in cells pretreated with cycloheximide, no further recovery was observed beyond this level, whereas in the absence of cycloheximide, the density of receptors at the cell surface continued to increase. This suggested that there were two components to the reappearance of M2 mAChRs at the cell surface following agonist-induced internalization. There was an initial protein synthesis-independent component responsible for recovery to approximately 50–60% of untreated cell-surface receptor levels. This was followed by a protein synthesis-dependent component that was responsible for further recovery to the cell surface. Initially, this suggested that the initial phase of recovery reflected recycling of internalized receptors to the cell surface and that the protein synthesis-dependent component might be because of synthesis of new receptors that were delivered to the cell surface. However, as demonstrated earlier (Fig. 1 B), the M2 mAChR did not appreciably down regulate in HEK293 cells. Furthermore, this lack of down-regulation was also observed in experiments performed in the presence of cycloheximide (data not shown), suggesting that synthesis of new receptors was not required to maintain receptor density. This observation also suggested that synthesis of new receptors was not responsible for the protein synthesis-dependent component of the recovery of the M2 mAChR to the cell surface. In addition, there was no change in total receptor number during the course of the recovery experiments (data not shown), which further supported the conclusion that synthesis of M2 mAChRs was not responsible for the protein synthesis-dependent component of recovery of receptors to the cell surface. To further characterize the process of reappearance of M2mAChR to the cell surface, we determined whether the length of agonist treatment affected the rate or extent of the recovery process. The recovery of internalized M2 mAChRs to the cell surface following a 10-min CCh treatment was similar to the recovery following a 30-min CCh treatment (Fig. 2 B). There appeared to be both protein synthesis-independent and -dependent components to the recovery following a 10-min CCh treatment. Interestingly, the protein synthesis-dependent component of recovery was smaller following a 10-min CCh treatment than for a 30-min CCh treatment. Thus, it appeared that the length of agonist treatment did not significantly affect the pattern of recovery of M2mAChRs to the cell surface following agonist treatment. To visualize the trafficking of the M2 mAChR to and away from the cell surface, we used immunofluorescent confocal microscopy. Immunostaining of the M2 mAChR showed heavy labeling of the cell surface that appeared to be continuous but did contain some punctate sites of staining. Significant intracellular staining located primarily at a perinuclear site was also detected (Fig.3 A, arrows). This intracellular staining reflected the finding from biochemical studies that approximately 40% of the total M2 mAChRs are intracellular in this cell line. Treatment with CCh for 30 min led to a striking redistribution of the M2 mAChR staining from the cell surface to a perinuclear site (Fig. 3 B). Inclusion of cycloheximide with CCh had no effect on the internalization of M2 mAChRs (Fig. 3 C), as was observed in the biochemical experiments (Fig. 2 A, 0 time point). Very little recovery of M2 mAChR staining to the cell surface was observed 2 h following washout of CCh in the presence (Fig.3 E) or absence (Fig. 3 D) of cycloheximide. Although some cell surface staining was observed in Fig. 3 D, the majority of the cells examined showed little cell surface staining at this time point. However, the staining pattern, both in the presence and absence of cycloheximide, showed a diffuse pattern of intracellular, punctate spots that apparently contained receptors in the process of trafficking to the cell surface. When the cells were stained for the M2 mAChR after 6 h of recovery, the staining patterns accurately reflected the biochemical data. The staining pattern of the cycloheximide-treated cells did not appear to have changed from the staining observed at 2 h recovery (compare Fig. 3 G with 3E), whereas cells that were subjected to the recovery protocol in the absence of cycloheximide showed a significant recovery of M2 mAChR staining at or near the cell surface (Fig. 3 F). Interestingly, this staining pattern was not identical to the pattern observed in untreated cells (compare Fig. 3 A versus 3F). The staining of the M2 mAChR following 6 h of recovery appeared to be much more punctate and clustered at or near the cell surface, as opposed to the more continuous cell surface labeling in untreated cells. Overall, the results obtained with the immunofluorescent staining of the M2 mAChR directly reflected the results from the biochemical experiments performed on the recovery of internalized M2 mAChRs and demonstrated discrete phases in trafficking of the receptors to the cell surface. It has been reported recently that phosphorylation of the V2 vasopressin receptor serves as an intracellular retention signal (23Innamorati G. Sadeghi H.M. Tran N.T. Birnbaumer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2222-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The V2 receptor did not recycle back to the cell surface following agonist treatment unless the receptor was made into a phosphorylation-deficient mutant (23Innamorati G. Sadeghi H.M. Tran N.T. Birnbaumer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2222-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Because we had previously demonstrated that phosphorylation of the M2 mAChR facilitated the internalization of this receptor (20Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14152-14158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), we asked whether phosphorylation served to regulate the recovery of the M2 mAChR to the cell surface. Two clusters of serine and threonine residues in the third intracellular loop of the M2 mAChR have been identified as sites of agonist-dependent phosphorylation (20Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14152-14158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). When these residues were mutated to alanines in the N,CAla-8 mutant, a total loss of agonist-induced phosphorylation of the M2mAChR was observed (20Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14152-14158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We utilized this N,CAla-8 mutant to test whether phosphorylation of the M2 mAChR had an effect on its recovery from agonist-mediated internalization. The N,CAla-8 mutant does not internalize as rapidly or as extensively as the wild type M2 mAChR (20Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14152-14158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Note that after a 60-min treatment with CCh only 30–35% of the cell-surface receptors have been internalized (Fig. 4, 0 time recovery). The pattern of recovery of the N,CAla-8 mutant appeared to be generally similar to the recovery of the wild type M2 mAChR, as the recovery of the N,CAla-8mutant was relatively slow and was not affected by cycloheximide during the first 2 h of recovery (Fig. 4). However, in contrast to the wild type M2 mAChR, there was no statistical difference in the recovery curves of the N,CAla-8 mutant through 6 h of recovery. Nevertheless, there appeared to be a trend in the individual experiments of a small protein synthesis-dependent phase for the recovery of the N,CAla-8 receptor but an accurate analysis of this component was confounded by the low amount of internalization observed for this mutant receptor compared with its wild type counterpart. Overall, the results observed with this phosphorylation-deficient mutant suggested that phosphorylation did not significantly affect the recovery of the M2 mAChR to the cell surface following agonist treatment. In addition, the M2 mAChR did not behave like the V2 vasopressin receptor (23Innamorati G. Sadeghi H.M. Tran N.T. Birnbaumer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2222-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), because the reappearance of the M2 mAChR to the cell surface following agonist treatment was similar for the wild type and phosphorylation-deficient M2 mAChRs. Activated PBCM is an irreversible alkylating antagonist that binds to muscarinic receptors and forms a covalent bond to the receptors. Subsequently other agonists or antagonists are prohibited from binding to the receptors. PBCM has been used to examine the rate of constitutive internalization and recycling of muscarinic receptors in various cell systems (24Koenig J.A. Edwardson J.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 111: 1023-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 25Koenig J.A. Edwardson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17174-17182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Koenig J.A. Edwardson J.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 351-359PubMed Google Scholar, 27Koenig J.A. Edwardson J.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 276-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). We utilized PBCM to inactivate M2 mAChRs expressed in HEK293 cells to examine the constitutive, nonagonist-dependent internalization and recycling of the M2 mAChR. Inactivation of M2 mAChRs with PBCM was very efficient with 90% of the cell-surface receptors inactivated (see 0 time point in Fig.5 A). PBCM was unable to alkylate intracellular M2 mAChRs, as the number of intracellular receptors able to bind [3H]QNB following alkylation was similar before and after PBCM treatment. As a result, approximately 50% of the total receptors were not alkylated by PBCM (see time 0 in Fig. 5 B). Following washout of the PBCM, cells were allowed to recover for various periods of time in fresh medium. The appearance of nonalkylated receptors on the cell surface was detected with the cell impermeable ligand [3H]NMS and should reflect the delivery to the cell surface of receptors that were located at internal sites during the alkylation. This measurement should also reflect the constitutive internalization of receptors that were alkylated on the cell surface. The appearance of nonalkylated receptors on the cell surface following alkylation was very slow, as cell-surface receptor levels returned to approximately 40% of untreated cell-surface levels within 5 h post-alkylation (Fig.5 A). Incubation with cycloheximide showed a pattern of appearance of cell-surface M2 mAChRs that was reminiscent of the recovery of cell-surface receptors that was observed following agonist treatment. There appeared to be a small amount of recovery from constitutive recycling that was independent of protein synthesis, whereas the majority of the recovery was dependent on protein synthesis (Fig. 5 A). To test whether synthesis of new M2 mAChRs was responsible for the protein synthesis-dependent component of constitutive internalization and recycling, we measured total receptor number during the alkylation experiments using the hydrophobic antagonist, [3H]QNB. There was no change in total receptor number over the course of the recovery following alkylation, both in the absence and presence of cycloheximide (Fig. 5 B). This suggested that new receptor synthesis was not involved in the protein synthesis-dependent component of the appearance of new receptors at the cell surface following alkylation. Rather, the results suggested a requirement for the synthesis of another protein that was necessary for the trafficking of the receptors. This study presents new insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of M2 mAChRs by the ill-defined pathway that is responsible for the internalization of these receptors in HEK293 cells. The results demonstrated that the M2 mAChR did not appreciably down regulate in HEK293 cells and that the reappearance of M2 mAChRs at the cell surface following agonist-mediated internalization was a slow process. This latter process was independent of receptor phosphorylation but contained both protein synthesis-dependent and -independent components. Furthermore, the constitutive, nonagonist-dependent internalization and recycling of M2 mAChRs was an even slower process that also contained protein synthesis-dependent and -independent components. That the M2 mAChR did not appreciably down regulate when stably expressed in HEK293 cells was very surprising, as down-regulation is a regulatory mechanism thought to be utilized by most GPCRs, and has been shown to occur for the M2 mAChR when it is expressed in other cell types (28Tsuga H. Kameyama K. Haga T. Honma T. Lameh J. Sadee W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5323-5330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A general defect in down-regulation of GPCRs in HEK293 cells can be ruled out by the demonstration of down-regulation of the β2AR in HEK293 cells (22Gagnon A.W. Kallal L. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6976-6981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The lack of appreciable down-regulation of the M2 mAChR represents yet another piece of evidence demonstrating that the M2 mAChR is regulated uniquely in response to agonist treatment. Previous studies have demonstrated that the primary pathway of internalization for the M2 mAChR in HEK293 cells is independent of arrestin and dynamin function (19Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Gurevich V.V. Lee K.B. Ptasienski J.A. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23682-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). It is not evident if the lack of down-regulation of the M2mAChRs is a feature of this poorly characterized pathway or if a specific feature of the M2 mAChR precludes its down-regulation by the endogenous machinery present in HEK293 cells. However, it is worth noting that the down-regulation of the β2AR in HEK cells is an arrestin- and dynamin-sensitive process (22Gagnon A.W. Kallal L. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6976-6981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Whether arrestin- and dynamin-insensitive pathways of down-regulation exist has not been demonstrated. The experiments addressing the reappearance of internalized M2 mAChRs to the cell surface demonstrated a novel aspect of recovery in that the process was very slow and contained two separate components. This is the first known demonstration of this pattern of recovery of a GPCR following internalization. The initial phase of recovery for the M2 mAChR was independent of protein synthesis, whereas the later component was dependent on protein synthesis. The protein synthesis-dependent component did not appear to require synthesis of new receptors because there was no down-regulation of M2 mAChRs (Fig. 2) and there was no change in total receptor number over the course of the recovery experiments (data not shown). More likely, there was an accessory protein that was required for delivery of the M2 mAChR to the cell surface following internalization. We hypothesized that the turnover of this protein was relatively rapid and that cellular levels of this protein were sufficient for the protein synthesis-independent component of recovery, but synthesis of new accessory protein was necessary for full recovery of M2 mAChRs to the cell surface. Because the magnitude of the protein synthesis-dependent component appeared to be reduced in cells that had been treated with agonist for 10 versus 30 min, it is possible that stimulation of the M2 mAChR resulted in the activation of the synthesis of the required accessory protein. Stimulation of the M2 mAChR for 30 min may have allowed for more production of the accessory protein and a resultant increase in the protein synthesis-dependent component of recovery. This hypothesis was ruled out by experiments employing cycloheximide during the CCh pretreatment period only and not during the subsequent recovery, or conversely, by adding cycloheximide during the recovery period only and not during the CCh pretreatment. If the production of the hypothesized accessory protein was stimulated by CCh, incubation with cycloheximide during the CCh pretreatment and not the recovery should show only the protein synthesis-independent component of recovery. Conversely, if the production of the accessory protein is independent of CCh stimulation, incubation with cycloheximide only during the recovery period should show only the protein synthesis-independent component of recovery. Incubation with cycloheximide during the CCh pretreatment only showed both protein synthesis-independent and -dependent components, whereas incubation with cycloheximide during the recovery period only showed just the protein synthesis-independent component (data not shown). This suggested that the production of the accessory protein is independent of CCh stimulation. Thus, it appears that the necessary accessory protein is quite labile and has a high turnover rate. Phosphorylation of the M2 mAChR did not appear to affect the recovery of M2 mAChRs to the cell surface following agonist treatment. Phosphorylation has previously been demonstrated to act as a retention signal for the V2 vasopressin receptor following its internalization (23Innamorati G. Sadeghi H.M. Tran N.T. Birnbaumer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2222-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, the phosphorylation-deficient M2 mAChR mutant, the N,CAla-8 mutant (20Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14152-14158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), displayed a recovery to the cell surface similar to that of the wild type M2 mAChR. The constitutive, nonagonist-dependent internalization and recycling of the M2 mAChR reflected the pattern of recovery of the M2 mAChR following agonist-mediated internalization. However, whereas a small amount of constitutive internalization and recycling was observed in the absence of protein synthesis, a much larger and slower component of the constitutive recycling was dependent on protein synthesis. Measurement of total receptor number following alkylation of cell-surface receptors showed that there was no change in total receptor number over the time course of the recovery experiments. This suggested that an accessory protein was required for recycling of receptors to the cell surface during the constitutive, nonagonist-dependent internalization and recycling. These results suggested that similar mechanisms could be operating for trafficking of M2 mAChRs to the cell surface following both agonist-dependent and constitutive, nonagonist-dependent internalization. In summary, we have demonstrated previously unappreciated aspects of the trafficking of M2 mAChRs. When stably expressed in HEK293 cells the M2 mAChR internalized extensively but did not appreciably down regulate in response to prolonged CCh treatment. The recovery of M2 mAChRs to the cell surface following both agonist-induced internalization as well as constitutive, nonagonist-dependent internalization was slow and contained both protein synthesis-dependent and -independent components. We hypothesize that the protein synthesis-dependent component involved an accessory protein necessary for trafficking of M2 mAChRs to the cell surface. Finally, the data indicated that recovery from agonist-induced internalization is independent of receptor phosphorylation. These experiments provide needed insights into the novel pathways mediating the internalization of M2mAChRs and their recycling to the cell surface."

For the inner membrane ofEscherichia coli, numerous studies have shown that an excess of positively charged residues defines a cytoplasmic domain of a membrane protein (“positive inside” rule). The role of negatively charged residues in establishing membrane protein topology, however, is not completely understood. To investigate the influence of negatively charged residues on this process in detail, we have constructed a single spanning chimeric receptor fragment comprising the N terminus and first transmembrane domain of the heptahelical G protein-coupled vasopressin V2 receptor and the first cytoplasmic loop of the β2-adrenergic receptor. When fused to alkaline phosphatase (PhoA), the receptor fragment inserted into the inner membrane of E. coli with its N terminus facing the cytoplasm (Nin-Cout orientation), although both membrane-flanking domains had rather similar topogenic determinants. The orientation of the receptor fragment was changed after the introduction of single glutamate residues into the N terminus. Orientation inversion, however, was found to be dependent on the location of the glutamate substitutions, which had to lie within a narrow window up to 6 residues distant from the transmembrane domain. These results demonstrate that a single negatively charged residue can play an active role as a topogenic determinant of membrane proteins in the inner membrane of E. coli, but only if it is located adjacent to a transmembrane domain.

For proteins in the inner membrane of Escherichia coli, the “positive inside” rule (1von Heijne G. Gavel Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar) predicts that loops with an excess of positively charged residues are directed to the cytoplasmic face of the membrane, and many studies have demonstrated that positively charged residues indeed inhibit translocation (for review see Ref. 2von Heijne G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). For membrane proteins in the eucaryotic endoplasmic reticulum membrane, the related “charge difference” rule postulates that the charge difference between the flanking segments determines orientation and that negatively and positively charged residues contribute equally (3Hartmann E. Rapoport T. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5786-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). The charge difference rule was recently confirmed in yeast with fragments of the pheromone receptor Ste2p (4Harley C.A. Tipper D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24625-24633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 5Harley C.A. Holt J.A. Turner R. Tipper D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24963-24971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Folding of an N-terminal domain of a membrane protein impairs translocation and can also influence the orientation (6Spiess M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). For the inner membrane of E. coli, it was demonstrated that the positive inside rule is based on the electrochemical membrane potential (positive and acidic outside) (7Andersson H. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2267-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 8Cao G. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 866-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The membrane potential impairs the translocation of positively charged residues and facilitates that of negatively charged residues (7Andersson H. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2267-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 8Cao G. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 866-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Although the strong topogenic potential of positively charged residues for such an electrophoretic mechanism has been consistently demonstrated, the significance of negatively charged residues is not so clear and has been reported to occur only under certain conditions. From experiments with the double spanning (Nout-Cin) leader peptidase (Lep) of E. coli, these were defined as the presence of very high numbers of negatively charged residues (3–4 Asp or Glu residues) (9Andersson H. Bakker E. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1491-1495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the position-specific attenuation of positively charged residues lying in conformational vicinity to them (10Andersson H. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21389-21393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments with a fusion protein consisting of the N-terminal tail of the phage Pf3 coat protein and Lep indicated that a decreased hydrophobicity of the corresponding transmembrane domain might be another requirement since, in this case, the influence of the membrane potential and hence that of negative charges increases (11Delgado-Partin V.M. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9927-9934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In contrast to those effects that are detectable only under certain conditions, an active and direct role of negatively charged residues as topogenic determinants in the inner membrane of E. coli was also reported using the single spanning (Nout-Cin) wild-type Pf3 protein (12Kiefer D. Hu X. Dalbey R. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2197-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Negatively charged residues were found essential to promote the translocation of the N terminus of this protein and thus to establish the correct topology, even in the absence of positively charged residues (12Kiefer D. Hu X. Dalbey R. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2197-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Here we have investigated whether negatively charged residues can play an active role as topogenic determinants for proteins in the inner membrane of E. coli and whether there might be a critical distance from the transmembrane domain within which negatively charged residues are effective. As a model, we used a single spanning chimeric receptor fragment comprising the N terminus and TM11 of the heptahelical G protein-coupled vasopressin V2 receptor and the IL1 domain of the β2-adrenergic receptor. This fragment inserted with an Nin-Cout orientation and was thus suited for assessment of the translocation of the N terminus in the presence of additional negatively charged residues. To determine the orientation of this protein in vivo, the PhoA protein ofE. coli (13Manoil C. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8129-8133Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar) was fused C-terminally. PhoA is only active when translocated into the periplasm and is thus a suitable marker for membrane protein orientation (13Manoil C. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8129-8133Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase (LacZ) fusions, which are active only when the LacZ moiety is located in the cytoplasm (14Manoil C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were used as controls. We show that even a single negatively charged residue can play an active role as a topogenic determinant. In addition, we have defined for the first time a window region and show that single negatively charged residues are only effective within a stretch of 6 residues from the transmembrane domain.

Plasmids pPROV71.PhoA and pPROV71.LacZ, encoding PhoA and LacZ fusions, respectively, to a V2 receptor fragment comprising the N terminus, the first transmembrane domain, and the first cytoplasmic loop, have been described previously (16Schülein R.

For site-directed mutagenesis, the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used without subcloning procedures. The nucleotide sequences of DNA fragments were verified using the FS dye terminator kit from Perkin-Elmer (Weiterstadt, Germany). A schematic depiction of the PhoA and LacZ fusion proteins used in this study is shown in Fig. 1. Fusions of PhoA and LacZ to a V2 receptor fragment comprising the N terminus, TM1, and IL1 (71 amino acids) in the E. coliexpression vector pTRC99A have been described previously (pPROV71.PhoA and pPROV71.LacZ) (16Schülein R.

For the construction of an equivalent fragment of the β2receptor, the corresponding cDNA fragment was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from the original sequence (5′-primer, 5′-CCCCAGCCAGTAAGCTTACCTGCCAGACTG-3′; and 3′-primer, 5′-GAAGTAGTTGGGATCCGTCTGCAGACGCTCGAA-3′). The 3′-primer introduced a novel BamHI site downstream of the stop codon. The polymerase chain reaction fragment was cloned into pTRC99A using the internal NcoI site of the β2 receptor cDNA, which overlaps the start codon, and the newly insertedBamHI site. The phoA gene of pPROV71.PhoA (see above) was inserted as a BamHI/HindIII fragment into the resulting plasmid, and the lacZ gene of pPROV71.LacZ (see above) was inserted as a BamHI fragment. The resulting plasmids were designated pPROβ66.PhoA and pPROβ66.LacZ and encode PhoA and LacZ fusions, respectively, to a β2 receptor fragment comprising the N terminus, TM1, and IL1 (66 amino acids) (see Fig. 1). For the construction of chimeric receptor fragments, BstZ17I sites were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis into plasmids pPROV71.PhoA and pPROβ66.PhoA in the sequences encoding the TM1/IL1 interfaces. The primer sequences were 5′-GGTGCTGGCGGCCGTATACCGGCGGGGCC-3′ (and its complementary equivalent) for pPROV71.PhoA and 5′-GGTCATCACAGCCGTATACAAGTTCGAGCG-3′ (and its complementary equivalent) for pPROβ66.PhoA. TheBstZ17I/XbaI fragments of the resulting plasmids were exchanged reciprocally. The resulting plasmid pV2/ILβ2.PhoA encodes a PhoA fusion to a receptor fragment comprising the N terminus and TM1 of the V2 receptor and IL1 of the β2 receptor. The resulting plasmid pβ2/ILV2.PhoA encodes a PhoA fusion to a receptor fragment comprising the N terminus and TM1 of the β2 receptor and IL1 of the V2 receptor (see Fig. 1). For the construction of the corresponding LacZ fusion, the BamHI/XbaI fragments of plasmids pV2/ILβ2.PhoA and pβ2/ILV2.PhoA encoding the PhoA portions were replaced by that of pPROV71.LacZ (see above) encoding the LacZ portion. The resulting plasmids were designated pV2/ILβ2.LacZ and pβ2/ILV2.LacZ, respectively. For the construction of charge mutants within the N terminus or the IL domain of the V2/ILβ2.PhoA receptor fragment, the corresponding plasmid was used directly for site-directed mutagenesis. 2Primer sequences are available upon request. For construction of the corresponding LacZ fusions, theBamHI/XbaI fragments of the resulting mutant plasmids encoding the PhoA portions were replaced by that of pPROV71.LacZ (see above) encoding the LacZ portion. E. coli CC118 cells were cultivated in LB medium (10 g/liter Bacto-peptone, 5 g/liter yeast extract, and 5 g/liter NaCl) or on LB agar plates at 37 °C. Ampicillin was used at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. For the determination of whole cell PhoA activity, 20 ml of LB medium were inoculated with a 400-μl overnight culture of an E. coli CC118 clone and grown at 37 °C for 2 h with aeration. Cells were induced with 1 mm IPTG and grown for an additional 45 min. The PhoA and LacZ activity assays were based on the protocols of Brickman and Beckwith (17Brickmann E. Beckwith J. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 96: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) and Miller (18Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar), respectively. To determine PhoA activity, bacteria from a 100-μl cell suspension were harvested (10 min, 8000 × g, 4 °C), and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was supplemented with 300 μl of 1m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 25 μl of 0.1% SDS, and 25 μl of chloroform. Samples were stirred for 20 min at 28 °C. After phase separation, 200 μl of the aqueous upper phase were transferred into a microtiter plate well. Reactions were started by the addition of 25 μl of a solution containing 1 m Tris-HCl, 5 mg/mlp-nitrophenyl phosphate, and 5 mmMgCl2 (pH 8.0). Reactions were incubated for 170 min at 28 °C, and A 415 was measured on a microtiter plate reader. To determine LacZ activity, bacteria from a 100-μl cell suspension were harvested and supplemented with 300 μl of buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, and 50 mmβ-mercaptoethanol (pH 7.0)), 25 μl of 0.1% SDS, and 25 μl of chloroform. Samples were stirred for 20 min at 28 °C. After phase separation, 200 μl of the aqueous upper phase were transferred into a microtiter plate well. Reactions were started by the addition of 25 μl of a solution containing 100 mmK2HPO4 and 4 mg/mlo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside (pH 7.0). Reactions were incubated for 170 min at 28 °C, andA 415 was measured on a microtiter plate reader. Aliquots containing 1.5 × 106 cells of an induced E. coli CC118 clone were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. For lysis, cells were boiled for 3 min in 20 μl of Laemmli buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 10% glycerin, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue (pH 6.8)). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide) and blotted onto nitrocellulose filters as described (19Khyse-Andersen J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar). For the detection of PhoA fusions, filters were blocked for 1 h with blocking buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.9% NaCl, 1% casein, and 1% gelatin (pH 7.2)), supplemented with anti-PhoA antibodies (1:4000 dilution), and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Filters were washed three times (10 min each) with wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl and 0.9% NaCl (pH 7.2)), and anti-rabbit 125I-IgG was added to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml (1 μCi/ml). Filters were incubated for 2 h at room temperature, washed three times (5 min each) with wash buffer, dried, and exposed to x-ray film (1 day). For the detection of LacZ fusions, filters were blocked for 1 h with buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5% low fat milk powder, and 1% Triton X-100 (pH 7.0)) and incubated with monoclonal anti-LacZ antibodies (1:4000 dilution in buffer A) for 1 h at room temperature. Filters were washed four times (15 min each) with buffer A and incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000 dilution in buffer A) for 1 h at room temperature. Filters were washed four times (10 min each) with buffer A; twice (10 min each) with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100, (pH 7.0); and once (5 min) with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5. Filters were incubated in staining solution (0.56 mm 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and 0.48 mm nitro blue tetrazolium) until bands became visible. The protease sensitivity of solubilized PhoA fusion proteins was used to localize the PhoA moieties and to control the PhoA activity data. Prior to membrane protein solubilization, spheroplasts were prepared according to the method of Koshland and Botstein (20Koshland D. Botstein D. Cell. 1980; 20: 749-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) to facilitate cell lysis. 20 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin were inoculated with a 400-μl overnight culture of an E. coli CC118 clone and grown at 37 °C for 2 h with aeration. Cells were induced with 1 mm IPTG and grown for 45 min at 37 °C with aeration. Bacteria were harvested (10 min, 8000 × g, 4 °C) and resuspended in 900 μl of ice-cold osmotic shock buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 500 mm sucrose (pH 8.0)). After the addition of 100 μl of lysozyme solution (2 mg/ml shock buffer) and 900 μl of ice-cold H2O, cells were incubated for 5 min on ice to allow the formation of spheroplasts. The suspension was supplemented with 80 μl of 500 mm MgCl2, and spheroplasts were collected by centrifugation at 1500 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. After removal of the supernatant containing periplasmic proteins, spheroplasts were broken in 1 ml of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm Na-EDTA, (pH 8.0)), and membrane proteins were solubilized. The solution was divided into two 500-μl aliquots. One aliquot was incubated with trypsin (1 μg/μl final concentration) for 30 min at 4 °C on an Eppendorf shaker. Protease digestion was stopped with 50 μl of Complete protease inhibitor mixture. The control sample was supplemented immediately after membrane protein solubilization with protease inhibitor. For the detection of the PhoA fusions by immunoblot analysis, 20-μg protein samples were applied per lane. We have previously shown that a V2 receptor fragment comprising the N terminus, TM1, and IL1 (Fig. 1) is inserted with its correct Nout-Cin orientation in the inner membrane ofE. coli (16Schülein R. Rutz C. Rosenthal W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28844-28852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In contrast, Lacatena et al. (21Lacatena R.M. Cellini A. Scavizzi F. Tocchini-Valentini G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10521-10525Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the corresponding fragment of the β2receptor adopts an inverted Nin-Coutorientation. Both results are consistent with the positive inside rule; IL1 of the V2 receptor contains significantly more positively charged residues than IL1 of the β2 receptor (16Schülein R. Rutz C. Rosenthal W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28844-28852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 21Lacatena R.M. Cellini A. Scavizzi F. Tocchini-Valentini G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10521-10525Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To investigate the process of topology determination with high sensitivity, it is advantageous to use a model protein with similar topogenic determinants on either side of the transmembrane domain. In this case, orientation may be influenced by the addition of single charged residues. With this in mind, we constructed a β2 receptor fragment comprising the N terminus, TM1, and IL1 (PROβ66) (Fig. 1), corresponding to the previously described V2 receptor fragment PROV71 (Fig. 1) (16Schülein R. Rutz C. Rosenthal W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28844-28852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We next generated chimeric receptor fragments by exchanging the IL1 domains reciprocally. The resulting receptor fragment β2/ILV2 (Fig. 1) contains the N terminus and TM1 of the β2 receptor and the IL1 domain of the V2 receptor, whereas V2/ILβ2(Fig. 1) contains the N terminus and TM1 of the V2 receptor and the IL1 domain of the β2 receptor. To determine the orientation of the receptor fragments in vivo, they were cloned into the E. coli expression vector pTRC99A, and PhoA and LacZ enzyme moieties were fused C-terminally. The PhoA- and LacZ-negative E. coli strain CC118 was transformed with the expression plasmids. Cells were induced with IPTG, and PhoA and LacZ activity assays were performed (Fig.2 A). As described previously, high LacZ activity, but no PhoA activity, was found in cells expressing the V2 receptor fragment PROV71, demonstrating its correct Nout-Cin orientation (16Schülein R. Rutz C. Rosenthal W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28844-28852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In contrast, and in agreement with the data of Lacatena et al. (21Lacatena R.M. Cellini A. Scavizzi F. Tocchini-Valentini G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10521-10525Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), high PhoA activity, but no LacZ activity, was detected in cells expressing the β2 receptor fragment PROβ66, demonstrating its inverted Nin-Coutorientation. When the IL1 domain of the β2 receptor fragment is replaced by that of the V2 receptor (chimera β2/ILV2), the loss of PhoA activity and the acquisition of LacZ activity demonstrate that the correct Nout-Cin orientation is established. These results are consistent with the positive inside rule. The number of positively charged residues in IL1 is increased from 2 residues in the β2 receptor fragment to 5 residues in the chimeric fragment. If the IL1 domain of the V2 receptor fragment is replaced by that of the β2 receptor (chimera V2/ILβ2), the correct Nout-Cin orientation of the PhoA fusion protein is changed to the Nin-Cout orientation as demonstrated by the appearance of high PhoA activity. (No proteolytic degradation products indicative of residual Nout-Cin-oriented fragments were observed, indicating that this orientation switch is complete (see below).) The topogenic determinants of the two membrane-flanking domains of the V2/ILβ2.PhoA fusion protein, however, seem to be rather similar. This is indicated by the corresponding LacZ fusion protein, which also displayed an active phenotype, demonstrating that at least part of the V2/ILβ2.LacZ fusion protein remains in the correct Nout-Cinorientation. (Although not demonstrated directly, the virtual halving of the LacZ activity compared with that of the PROV71.LacZ receptor fragment suggests that this fusion protein adopts both orientations.) To demonstrate that the observed differences in the PhoA or LacZ activities of the fusions are not caused by different expression levels, the fusion proteins were also quantified in whole cell lysates by immunoblot analyses using polyclonal anti-PhoA and monoclonal anti-LacZ antibodies (Fig. 2 B). For all PhoA fusion proteins, two specifically stained bands with apparent molecular masses of 55 and 50 kDa were detected. The observed molecular mass of the upper 55-kDa band is in good agreement with the calculated sizes of the receptor fragments plus their PhoA moieties (54.9 kDa, PROV71.PhoA; 54.5 kDa, PROβ66.PhoA; 54.8 kDa, V2/ILβ2.PhoA; and 54.7 kDa, β2/ILV2.PhoA). This band thus seems to represent the intact fusion proteins. The lower 50-kDa band most likely represents proteolytic degradation products. Proteolysis of PhoA fusion proteins was also observed in previous studies (e.g. Refs.15Schülein R. Gentschev I. Mollenkopf H.J. Goebel W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 234: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar and 22Henn D.K. Baumann A. Kaupp U.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7425-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It is not known whether this degradation occurs in vivo or during cell lysis. In any case, the immunoblot demonstrates that all PhoA-tagged receptor fragments are expressed in roughly similar amounts and that the observed PhoA activities are not caused primarily by different expression levels. For each of the corresponding LacZ fusion proteins, a specifically stained band with an apparent molecular mass of 125 kDa and a double band of 90 and 85 kDa were detected (Fig. 2 B). The observed molecular mass of the upper band is in good agreement with the calculated sizes of the receptor fragments plus their LacZ moieties (123 kDa, PROV71.LacZ; 122.6 kDa, PROβ66.LacZ; 122.9 kDa, V2/ILβ2.LacZ; and 122.8 kDa, β2/ILV2.LacZ). This band thus seems to represent the intact fusion proteins. The lower band most likely represents degradation products. Similar to the PhoA fusions, the immunoblot demonstrates that all LacZ fusions are expressed in roughly similar amounts and that the observed activities are not caused by different expression levels. For the PhoA fusions, the orientations were also verified by protease sensitivity assays. Mature PhoA protein is protease-resistant, but only after translocation into the oxidizing environment of the periplasm, where an intramolecular disulfide bond is formed (23Sone M. Kishigami S. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6174-6178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In contrast, it is protease-sensitive in the reducing environment of the cytoplasm, where the critical disulfide bond cannot be formed. Upon protease treatment, a solubilized PhoA fusion protein should be converted to the size of mature protease-resistant PhoA if the PhoA portion reaches the periplasm. In contrast, it should be completely digested when the PhoA portion is located in the cytoplasm. To assess for the localization of the PhoA moieties of the receptor fragments, the E. coliCC118 clones expressing the fusion proteins were converted to spheroplasts to facilitate subsequent cell disruption. The spheroplasts were lysed in the presence of SDS and Triton X-100, and solubilized membrane proteins were treated with trypsin. The PhoA fusions were detected by immunoblotting with polyclonal anti-PhoA antibodies (Fig.3). For the PROβ66.PhoA and V2/ILβ2.PhoA receptor fragments, the two specific 55- and 50-kDa bands were detected in the untreated controls as described above for the total cell lysates (Fig. 2 B). Upon trypsin treatment, both bands were shifted to a single band with an apparent molecular mass of 48 kDa, corresponding exactly to the calculated size of mature protease-resistant PhoA. The protease resistance of the PhoA moieties of these receptor fragments demonstrates their Nin-Cout orientation. In contrast, the PROV71.PhoA and β2/ILV2.PhoA receptor fragments were completely digested upon trypsin treatment, demonstrating the protease sensitivity of their PhoA moieties and thus their complete Nout-Cin orientation. In the untreated controls of these two receptor fragments, the intact 55-kDa bands were accompanied by several degradation products, which were not observed in total cell lysates. Spheroplast formation may activate additional endogenous E. coli proteases that further degrade the protease-sensitive PhoA moieties of these two receptor fragments. The fact that these additional degradation products were not detectable in the untreated lanes of the chimeric V2/ILβ2.PhoA receptor fragment supports the conclusion that this receptor fragment inserts completely in the Nin-Cout orientation. In summary, the results of the protease sensitivity assays are entirely consistent with those of the PhoA activity assays. To assess the precise influence of negatively charged residues on protein topology determination in the inner membrane of E. coli, we used the PhoA-tagged chimeric receptor fragment V2/ILβ2.PhoA. It is inserted with an Nin-Cout orientation, but seems nevertheless to have rather similar topogenic determinants in its membrane-flanking sequences (see above) and should thus represent a good model for these studies. To investigate whether negatively charged residues may play an active topogenic role, we introduced clustered (1von Heijne G. Gavel Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 2von Heijne G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 3Hartmann E. Rapoport T. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5786-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar) negatively charged glutamate residues into the N terminus of this fragment (Fig.4 A). E. coli CC118 cells were transformed with the respective expression plasmids, and the orientation of the fusion proteins was assessed by PhoA activity assays (Fig. 4 B). In the proximity of the transmembrane domain, 3 glutamate residues (P34E/L35E/L36E), 2 glutamate residues (L35E/L36E), and even a single glutamate residue (L36E) were sufficient to establish the opposite Nout-Cin orientation as demonstrated by the complete loss of PhoA activity. A more distantly introduced single glutamate residue (20 residues from the transmembrane domain, S21E) had only a barely detectable effect. More glutamate residues may be needed in this region to invert the orientation since 2 (P20E/S21E) or 3 (L19E/P20E/S21E) glutamate residues decreased the PhoA activity further. All mutant V2/ILβ2.PhoA receptor fragments were detected in similar amounts by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 4 C), demonstrating that the observed PhoA activities are not caused by different expression levels. The activities of clones expressing the corresponding LacZ fusions were used as controls for the PhoA activity data (Table I). A strong increase in LacZ activity, indicating stabilization of the Nout-Cinorientation, was observed when the 3 glutamate residues (P34E/L35E/L36E), the 2 glutamate residues (L35E/L36E), or the single glutamate residue (L36E) was introduced in the proximity of the transmembrane domain. The more distantly introduced glutamate residue (S21E) had again only a minor effect, which appeared to increase after progressive addition of further glutamate residues to this region (P20E/S21E and L19E/P20E/S21E). The data obtained with LacZ fusions thus strongly support those obtained with PhoA fusions.Table ILacZ activities of IPTG-induced E. coli CC118 clones expressing LacZ fusions with the chimeric V 2 /ILβ 2 receptor fragment and with its mutants carrying additional charged residuesConstructLacZ activity1-aLacZ activities are shown in arbitrary units (V2/ILβ2PhoA without additional negatively charged residues = 1) and represent the mean ± S.D. from three individual experiments, each performed in quadruplicate.

LacZ activity assays were performed with total lysates from 1.9 × 108cells. Open table in a new tab Our results imply that there might be a critical distance within which a single glutamate residue is effective. To address this question, we introduced such residues at a distance of 2–7, 10, 13, and 20 residues from the transmembrane domain into the N terminus of the chimeric V2/ILβ2.PhoA receptor fragment construct (Fig. 5 A). E. coliCC118 cells were transformed with the expression plasmids, and the orientation of the fusion proteins was assessed by PhoA activity assays (Fig. 5 B) and immunoblotting (Fig. 5 C). A strong decrease in PhoA activity, demonstrating the establishment of the Nout-Cin orientation, was observed only for those glutamate substitutions lying within 6 residues of the transmembrane domain (A39E, R38E, A37E, L36E, and L35E). The more distant glutamate substitutions (P34E, T31E, P28E, and S21E) had only small or negligible effects. All mutant receptor fragments were expressed in similar amounts as demonstrated by immunoblotting of total cell lysates (Fig. 5 C). The different PhoA activities are thus not caused by different expression levels. The PhoA activity data are strongly supported by those for the corresponding LacZ fusions (Table I). Here, too, a major increase in LacZ activity, indicating stabilization of the Nout-Cin orientation, was observed only for those glutamate substitutions that lie within the 6-residue window of the transmembrane domain (A39E, R38E, A37E, L36E, and L35E). The more distantly introduced glutamate residues (P34E, T31E, P28E, and S21E) had minor effects. In summary, our results demonstrate that even a single glutamate residue can play an active role as a topogenic determinant, but only when it is present in the proximity of the transmembrane domain. We finally assessed whether positively charged residues might also serve as topogenic determinants in our experimental system. Single and clustered (1von Heijne G. Gavel Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 2von Heijne G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 3Hartmann E. Rapoport T. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5786-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar) arginine residues were introduced into the IL1 domain of the chimeric V2/ILβ2.PhoA receptor fragment (Fig.6 A), and the orientation of the fusion proteins was assessed by PhoA activity assays (Fig.6 B) and immunoblotting (Fig. 6 C). Consistent with the positive inside rule, a complete loss of PhoA activity demonstrating the establishment of the Nout-Cinorientation was observed when 2 (Y63R/F65R) or 3 (Y63R/F65R/L68R) positively charged residues were present. Individual positively charged residues (Y63R, F65R, L68R, and T70R), however, had only minor or negligible effects. The immunoblot with total cell lysates demonstrates that all mutant receptor fragments were expressed in similar amounts (Fig. 6 C). For the corresponding LacZ fusions, complementary activity data were obtained (Table I), i.e. a strong activity increase occurred after the introduction of 2 (Y63R/F65R) or 3 (Y63R/F65R/L68R) positively charged residues, but only minor effects were observed after the introduction of single charges (Y63R, F65R, L68R, and T70R). We have shown that the introduction of even a single glutamate residue into the N terminus of V2/ILβ2.PhoA can invert the orientation of this receptor fragment. In contrast, 2 or more additional arginine residues are needed in the IL1 domain to cause an equivalent effect. The weaker influence of positively charged residues is not surprising if one assumes that the IL1 domain (see Fig.1) and the attached 452-residue PhoA moiety are transported via the Sec machinery over the inner membrane, which seems to be the general mechanism for all translocated fragments longer than 60 residues (24Andersson H. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 683-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In Sec-dependent transport, translocation of positively charged residues is facilitated (25Andersson H. von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), thus clarifying their weaker influence. In contrast to the IL1/PhoA domain, the N terminus of V2/ILβ2.PhoA is most probably translocated Sec-independently. It was postulated that this is the general translocation mechanism for all N tail proteins without a signal peptide (26Cao G. Dalbey R.E. EMBO. J. 1994; 13: 4662-4669Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In such Sec-independent translocation, charged residues are assumed to have a stronger topogenic potential, thus explaining the stronger influence of negatively charged residues in this case. Whereas it seems clear that the electrochemical membrane potential can promote the translocation of negatively charged residues (7Andersson H. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2267-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 8Cao G. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 866-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 11Delgado-Partin V.M.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2197-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), they were thought to be topogenically active only under certain conditions. Among these were the presence of high numbers of negatively charged residues (9Andersson H. Bakker E. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1491-1495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a decreased hydrophobicity of the corresponding transmembrane domain (11Delgado-Partin V.M. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9927-9934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and the position-specific attenuation of positively charged residues lying in their conformational vicinity (10Andersson H. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21389-21393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For V2/ILβ2.PhoA, a strong topogenic effect was seen even with a single glutamate residue. Taking the high hydrophobicity of the transmembrane domain of this receptor fragment into account, the first two conditions obviously do not apply here. A position-specific attenuation of positively charged residues may on first sight explain our results since a positively charged residue is present in the window region where the glutamate residues were introduced (Arg38; see Figs. 1 and 5). However, attenuation can be ruled out, at least for this arginine residue, since its replacement by glutamine leads only to a relatively minor reduction of PhoA activity (72% of the wild type) (data not shown), demonstrating that Arg38 is not essential to hold V2/ILβ2.PhoA in the Nin-Cout orientation. Furthermore, the effect of glutamate residues was observed in an uninterrupted window region, and not at specific residue positions within a certain sequence, as was the case for negatively charged residues, which attenuate positively charged residues (10Andersson H. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21389-21393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results thus strongly suggest that negatively charged residues can play an active and direct role as topogenic determinants and support those of Kiefer et al.(12Kiefer D. Hu X. Dalbey R. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2197-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that negatively charged residues help to translocate the N terminus of the Pf3 coat protein. We have also shown that the topogenic potential of a single negatively charged residue depends on its distance from the transmembrane domain and have defined a window region of 6 residues. Since high resolution structural data for the TM1 boundaries of V2/ILβ2.PhoA are not available, the length of this window region may vary by several residues. For a Pf3-Lep fusion protein, it was shown that when the hydrophobicity of the transmembrane domain of Lep was reduced, a negatively charged residue lying in the proximity of the transmembrane domain was necessary to translocate the N terminus, whereas a more distant residue was not (11Delgado-Partin V.M. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9927-9934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although we observed the topogenic effects even with a highly hydrophobic transmembrane domain, these results suggest that a similar window region might exist for the N terminus of the Pf3 protein. The reason why single glutamate residues are effective only within a critical distance from the transmembrane domain remains obscure. The head groups of negatively charged phospholipids contribute to the retention of positively charged residues on the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane (27van Klompenburg W. Nilsson I.M. von Heijne G. de Kruijff B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4261-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that these head groups interact only with residues in the proximity of the transmembrane domain. Repulsion of negatively charged residues on the cytoplasmic side may contribute to a mechanism that allows only those negatively charged residues lying within a critical distance from the transmembrane domain to influence the orientation of a membrane protein. On the other hand, the electrochemical membrane potential, which favors the translocation of negatively charged residues, and perhaps also their periplasmic retention, may also play a role. That the electrical field is of limited extension may explain the observed distance effects. We thank Schering AG (Berlin) for kindly providing anti-PhoA antibodies. E. coli CC118 was a gift from W.

https://openalex.org/W2073077991,"The general transcription factor TFIID is a multiprotein complex consisting of the TATA box-binding protein and multiple TATA box-binding protein-associated factors (TAFIIs). The central domain of human TAFII130 contains four glutamine-rich regions Q1-Q4 that interact with transcriptional activators such as Sp1 and CREB and mediate activation. We screened in yeast random point mutations introduced into Q1-Q4 against the Sp1 activation domain and obtained a distinct set of hTAFII130s with alterations in TAFII-activator interaction. Here we characterize functionally an hTAFII130 mutant containing a phenylalanine to serine change at position 311 (F311S) that is compromised in its ability to associate with Sp1B and CREB-N activation domains. Substitution of phenylalanine with tyrosine but not with isoleucine or tryptophan also reduced hTAFII130 interaction, suggesting that the hydrophobic character rather than the specific amino acid at this position is a key determinant of interaction. Deletion of nine amino acids (Δ9) surrounding Phe311 abolished the interaction of hTAFII130 with Sp1. Overexpression of hTAFII130Q1/Q2 and Q1-Q4 strongly inhibited Sp1-dependent transcriptional enhancement in transient transfection assays, whereas expression of either F311S or Δ9 only partially suppressed Sp1-mediated activation. Thus, a short hydrophobic sequence motif encompassing Phe311 in hTAFII130 represents a critical surface with which Sp1B interacts to activate transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1974488432,"The activity of the ς54-promoter Pu of Pseudomonas putida was examined in vitro with a DNA template lacking upstream activating sequences, such that RNA polymerase can be activated by the enhancer-binding protein XylR only from solution. Although the transcription activation pathway in this system lacked the step of integration host factor (IHF)-mediated looping of the XylR·DNA complex toward the prebound RNA polymerase, IHF still stimulated promoter activity. The positive effect of IHF became evident not only with XylR from solution, but also with other ς54-dependent activators such as NtrC and NifA. Furthermore, an equivalent outcome was shown for the nonspecific DNA-binding protein HU. This stimulation of transcription in the absence of the enhancer was traced to the recruitment of RNA polymerase (i.e. increased efficiency of formation of closed complexes) brought about by IHF or HU binding. Thus, under limiting concentrations of the polymerase, the factor-mediated binding of the enzyme to Pu seems to enter a kinetic checkpoint in the system that prevents the XylR-mediated formation of an open complex."

In a more general example of signaling from the secretory pathway to the nucleus, interruption of the yeast secretory path inhibits ribosome biogenesis: transcription and processing of rRNA and transcription of genes encoding ribosomal proteins are inhibited (5Liang S.

Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 705-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Formaldehyde was added directly to growing cultures for 10 min. Cells were then sedimented and resuspended for 10 min at room temperature in 3.7% formaldehyde, 10% methanol, 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 6.5; washed three times in buffer; and washed once in buffered 1.2 msorbitol. They were then carefully spheroplasted, adhered to polylysine-coated slides, dehydrated, and immunostained. For electron microscopy, cells were fixed in 2% formaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde, spheroplasted, and embedded in LR White. Thin sections were incubated with rabbit anti-β-galactosidase (Cappel, catalog no. 55976), which had been freed from cross-reactivity by preadsorption on fixed yeast, and then with anti-rabbit Ig colloidal gold. Glass bead extracts of cells prepared with buffered SDS were reduced, fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, blotted to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with the indicated antibodies, using ECL reagents for signal detection. Yeast carrying pGAL-NLS-lacZ were grown in raffinose dropout medium at 23 °C and shifted to the indicated temperatures upon addition of galactose (2% final concentration) 1–2 h before fixation and immunostaining. Yeast carrying pMIG1-GFP-lacZ were grown in glucose dropout medium and then diluted into dropout medium containing 5% glycerol until growth resumed and nuclear GFP could not be detected. (The preliminary growth in glucose medium is needed since growth in glycerol is slow.) To study import, cultures were shifted for 30 min to 23 or 37 °C and then supplemented with glucose (2% final concentration) ± cycloheximide. After 5 min, the cells were quickly washed and examined. Yeast carrying pHOG1-GFP were grown overnight in glucose synthetic medium. At this point, Hog1p-GFP is readily detected in the cytoplasm. The cells were then preincubated for 30 min at 23 or 37 °C and challenged by supplementation with NaCl (0.4 mfinal concentration) for 10 min before examination. To explore the causes of the transcriptional inhibition which is observed in sec mutants, we localized several nuclear proteins insec mutants and observed that they relocate to the cytoplasm. Fig. 1 A, for example, illustrates relocation of the nucleolar prolyl hydroxylase, Fpr3p/Npi46p, at 37 °C upon inhibition of vesicle exocytosis insec1–1, upon inhibition of transport through the Golgi insec7–1, and upon inhibition of several steps of membrane traffic in sec18–1. Comparable relocation is also seen insec12–4 and sec23–1, which block export from the ER. Several other nucleolar proteins also relocate under these conditions (Cbf5p, Nop1p, Nop4p, Nsr1p, and Ssb1p), as does the nucleoplasmic protein, Npl3p/Mtr13p (20Liu Y. Liang S. Tartakoff A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6750-6757Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 24Woolford Jr., J.L. Adv. Genet. 1991; 29: 63-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 25Jordan E. Shaw P. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1995; 11: 93-122Crossref Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 26Warner J. Microb. Rev. 1996; 53: 256-271Crossref Google Scholar). A substantially weaker effect is seen in sec63–1, which interrupts translocation into the ER. To interrupt membrane traffic in the absence of mutant proteins and temperature increase, we have used brefeldin A (27Turi T. Mueller U. Sazer S. Rose J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9166-9171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and also observe distinct although less extreme relocalization of a nucleolar protein within 30 min at 30 °C (Fig.1 B). The relocation in sec mutants of Fpr3p and the yeast fibrillarin homologue, Nop1p, is strikingly inhibited by cycloheximide (Fig. 1 A) or by the transcriptional inhibitor, thiolutin (data not shown). At least Fpr3p is known not to shuttle (20Liu Y. Liang S. Tartakoff A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6750-6757Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Moreover, relocation of Fpr3p and Nop1p is reversible: after incubatingsec1–1, sec7–1, or sec18–1 for 2 h at 37 °C, return to 23 °C for 2 h ± 100 μg/ml cycloheximide leads to reconcentration of these antigens in the nucleolus, unless ATP synthesis is inhibited. This evidence of reversibility demonstrates the significant stability of at least Fpr3p and Nop1p, thereby ruling out an alternate explanation of their appearance in the cytoplasm: ongoing synthesis and lack of import. Relocation of Fpr3p and Nop1p is not seen in wild type over 1 h at 30–37 °C ± cycloheximide or thiolutin (23Wente S. Rout M. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 705-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), or in several other temperature-sensitive mutants, e.g. act1–2, cdc33–1, pre1–1, andprp5–1, as well as in sec62–1, which inhibits protein translocation into the ER (data not shown). Our earlier studies have documented a close relation between relocation of nucleolar proteins to the cytoplasm and inhibition of nuclear import (20Liu Y. Liang S. Tartakoff A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6750-6757Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We have therefore inquired whether the three secmutants inhibit import of NLS-β-galactosidase, which has the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of SV40 large T antigen, and other proteins that require distinct import equipment: Mig1p-GFP-β-galactosidase, H2B-GFP, and Hog1p-GFP (19Ferrigno P. Posas F. Koepp D. Saito H. Silver P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5606-5614Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 21deVit R. Waddle J. Johnston M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1603-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 22Moreland R. Lengvin G. Singer R. Garcea R. Hereford L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4048-4057Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Import of each of these proteins can be readily documented in wild type at 23 °C or 37 °C, but is strongly inhibited in the sec mutants (Fig.2 A). When NLS-β-galactosidase is induced for 1 or 2 h at 37 °C, it is detected at the periphery of the nucleus and in the cytoplasm, with the peripheral distribution being most visible in sec1–1 andsec7–1 and the cytoplasmic signal most visible insec18–1 (Fig. 2 A). Fig. 2 (B andC) shows that a discrete amount of the import cargo actually enters the extreme periphery of the nucleoplasm. This is quite different from the docking of cargo at cytosolic NPC-associated sites in the absence of an energy source (28Richardson W. Mills A. Dilworth S. Laskey R. Cell. 1988; 52: 655-666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Thus, the secmutants may inhibit release of import cargo from the nucleoplasmic face of the NPC, as when the import factor, importin β, cannot interact with the GTP-bound nuclear pool of the GTPase, Ran, which governs nucleocytoplasmic transport (29Gönlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15 (in press)Google Scholar, 30Gorlich D. Pante N. Kutay U. Aebi U. Bischoff F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5584-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). As for relocation of nucleolar proteins, protein synthesis is required for inhibition of import; for example, Mig1p-GFP-β-galactosidase normally enters the nucleus upon shift from raffinose to glucose medium and this entry is inhibited in the sec mutants at 37 °C unlesscycloheximide is present (data not shown). Since Ran cycle mutants inhibit nuclear import and since the site of inhibition of import in secmutants suggests that there is a defect at the level of the Ran cycle, we have inquired whether the Ran-GAP mutant, rna1–1, and the Ran-GEF mutant, mtr1–1, relocate nucleolar proteins. As shown in Fig. 1 C, this is the case. Moreover, overexpression of yeast Ran strikingly protects import and reduces the relocation of Fpr3p and Nop1p in sec1–1, sec7–1, and sec18–1(Figs. 1 A, 2 C, and 3 B). Although these observations are consistent with the notion that import is critical for retention of nuclear proteins, inhibition of the importin α/β import path in corresponding mutants does not cause relocation ((srp1–31, rsl1–1) (Refs. 14Koepp D. Wong D. Corbett A. Silver P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1163-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 15Yano R. Oakes M. Yamaghishi M. Dodd J. Nomura M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5640-5650Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar and29Gönlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15 (in press)Google Scholar, 31Corbett A. Silver P. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 193-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar; data not shown). Furthermore, Ran does remain concentrated in the nucleus as judged by immunofluorescence in the secmutants (data not shown) and, although more subtle modifications may occur, the abundance and 1D gel mobility of yeast Ran, Rna1p and Mtr1p/Prp20p do not change over 2 h at 37 °C (Fig.3 A). Some aspects of cell physiology in the sec mutants (increased concentration of cytosolic proteins, limitation of the cell perimeter, altered relation between the cell wall and plasma membrane, etc.) may resemble the effects of exposure to media of altered tonicity. We have therefore asked whether expression from a high copy plasmid of the key MAP kinases implicated in resistance to hypertonic and hypotonic stress (Hog1p or Mpk1p (the terminal kinases of the PKC signaling path)), ensures protein import and nucleolar coherence in thesec mutants at 37 °C (12Brewster J. de Valoir T. Dwer N. Winter E. Gustin M. Science. 1993; 259: 1760-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar, 32Posas F. Saito H. Science. 1997; 276: 1702-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Remarkably, studies of the import of Mig1p-GFP-β-galactosidase and localization of Fpr3p or Nop1p show that Hog1p does have these effects (Figs. 1 A and2 C). Mpk1p does not provide protection (data not shown). Activation of Hog1p by hypertonic stress is accompanied by its phosphorylation and transient entry into the nucleus, its exit being mediated by the importin β family member, Crm1p (19Ferrigno P. Posas F. Koepp D. Saito H. Silver P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5606-5614Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 33Reiser V. Ruis H. Ammerer G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1147-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Since the protection by Hog1p may also reflect its entry into the nucleus, we have monitored the distribution of Hog1p-GFP in sec mutants. We observe that it remains concentrated in the cytoplasm, and that this is true even upon hypertonic shock (data not shown). Moreover, experiments in which Hog1p-GFP is expressed in crm1–1 show that Hog1p-GFP cannot be trapped in the nucleus, i.e. it does not cycle through the nucleus under normal growth conditions. Any relevant targets of Hog1p kinase activity therefore may be external to the NPC. Nevertheless, upon overexpression there may be some increased nuclear titer of Hog1p. Interestingly, HOG1 is not essential, and a Δhog1 strain is not obviously deficient in nuclear import or nucleolar organization. There has been only limited investigation of the heat shock response (HSR) in secmutants (34Normington M. Kohno K. Kozutsumi Y. Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1223-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 35Rose M. Misra L. Vogel J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1211-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). We observe that when sec1–1, sec7–1 orsec18–1 is incubated at 37 °C, there is a strong and sustained HSR, as judged by transcription from a reporter plasmid, pHSE 2- lacZ. The HSR exceeds that seen in wild type cells, both in intensity and in duration, withsec18–1 being the strongest. Moreover, immunoblotting and pulse labeling of newly synthesized proteins show clear induction of Hsp104 and Hsp70 proteins in these mutants at 37 °C. Nevertheless, by comparison to several temperative-sensitive strains that do not affect membrane traffic or relocate nuclear proteins (act1–2, cdc33–1, pre1–1, prp5–1, sec62–1), the HSR insec mutants is of intermediate intensity. In fact,sec62–1 induces a HSR that is substantially stronger than all the other strains. Moreover, incubation of wild type at 37 °C or treatment with doses of ethanol, arsenite, and dihydrosphingosine known to produce a HSR does not cause relocation. Thus, the HSR does not parallel relocation. Interestingly, inhibition of import of Mig1p-GFP-β-galactosidase and relocation of the nucleolar proteins do not require induction of heat shock proteins that depend on heat shock transcription factor (Hsf1p), judging from examination of asec1–1 hsf1 double mutant. Moreover, the hsf1mutant (and ssa1) does not itself inhibit import or cause relocation (data not shown). Although a HSR does not necessarily perturb the nucleus and although Hsf1p function is not needed to cause such perturbation, the impact ofsec mutations on the nucleus appears similar to the effects of incubation at elevated temperatures. Incubation at 42 °C, for example, also inhibits protein import and causes nucleolar proteins to relocate to the cytoplasm (20Liu Y. Liang S. Tartakoff A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6750-6757Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and incubation even at 37 °C selectively inhibits transcription of ribosomal protein genes (26Warner J. Microb. Rev. 1996; 53: 256-271Crossref Google Scholar, 37Lashkari D. DeRisi J. McCusker J. Namath A. Gentile C. Hwang S. Brown P. Davis R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13057-13062Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Since Ssa/Hsp70 proteins are needed to protect yeast against relocation at elevated temperature (20Liu Y. Liang S. Tartakoff A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6750-6757Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we have inquired whether overexpression of Ssa1p at 37 °C can protect the sec mutants against nuclear changes. Strikingly, Ssa1p overexpression does protect against inhibition of import and relocation (Figs. 1 A and2 C). Expression of yeast Ran or Hog1p does not alter levels of Ssa proteins, as detected by Western blotting (data not shown). Thus, the protection due to Ran or Hog1p appears not to be mediated by increasing the amount of Ssa proteins. The surprising rapid and reversible nuclear phenotypes of sec mutants are reminiscent of several previous, disparate reports, in addition to the inhibition of ribosome biogenesis mentioned in the Introduction. For example, there are unpublished observations of lack of import of a ribosomal protein-β-galactosidase fusion in a sec23 mutant (cited in Ref. 38Hicke L. Schekman R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1677-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Moreover, although we find that sec63 mutants do not have a strong phenotype, yeast carrying point mutations in Sec63p mislocalize an unidentified nucleolar protein and a newly synthesized SV40 large T antigen-NLS-invertase fusion to the cytoplasm (39Nelson M. Kurihara T. Silver P. Genetics. 1993; 134: 159-173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strikingly, it has also been reported that Schizosaccharomyces pombe can be rendered resistant to brefeldin A by overexpression of a homologue of a Ran-binding protein or by mutating the exportin, Crm1p (27Turi T. Mueller U. Sazer S. Rose J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9166-9171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We suggest thatsec1, sec7, and sec18 each send equivalent signals, which impact on Ran cycle function and cause relocation of nuclear proteins. We do not observe equivalent perturbation of the nucleus in sec mutants that block polypeptide translocation into the ER; however, this may be because of the major HSR that such mutants elicit. Why does interruption of membrane traffic perturb the nucleus? We can exclude several possibilities. (a) The mere presence of mutant Sec proteins might perturb the nucleus; however, neither haploid sec18–1 carrying aSEC18 plasmid nor sec18–1/SEC18 heterozygous diploids relocate nucleolar proteins at 37 °C (data not shown). (b) To learn whether relocation results from overaccumulation of newly synthesized proteins or lipids upstream from the secretion blocks, we have inquired: 1) whether relocation is seen in a sec61–2 sec18–1 double mutant, sincesec61–2 reduces translocation of newly synthesized proteins into the ER at the restrictive temperature (41Deshaies R. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2653-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar); and 2) whether relocation can be eliminated by inhibitors of fatty acid and sterol biosynthesis (cerulenin, zaragozic acid; Ref. 42Schneiter R. Hitomi M. Ivessa A.S. Kohlwein S.D. Tartakoff A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7161-7172Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). These experiments do not support the hypothesis that overaccumulation in the ER causes relocation. Relocation in sec18–1 sec61–2 is comparable tosec18–1 and the inhibitors of lipid synthesis (which themselves do not affect the distribution of nucleolar proteins in wild type cells), do not protect the sec mutants against the impact of the 37 °C incubation (data not shown). (c) An unfolded protein response is induced by tunicamycin and tunicamycin does inhibit ribosome biogenesis (6Mizuta K. Warner J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2493-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 8Nierras C. Warner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13235-13241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), but tunicamycin treatment does not cause relocation of nucleolar proteins over 2 h at 30 °C (data not shown). (d) Cycloheximide or transcriptional inhibitors do not cause relocation of nucleolar proteins. Moreover, these inhibitors protect the nucleus of sec mutants. It therefore cannot be true that mere interruption of delivery of one or more newly synthesized proteins to the cell surface is sufficient to perturb the nucleus. (e) “Unbalanced growth” may occur when thesec mutants continue to increase their mass but are unable to enlarge their surface area. A comparable imbalance has been suggested to underlie the “inositol-less death” that occurs when inositol auxotrophs are deprived of inositol, unless cycloheximide is present (43Culbertson M. Henry S. Genetic s. 1975; 80: 23-40Crossref Google Scholar). Nevertheless, inositol withdrawal from an ino1strain does not relocate nucleolar proteins over 4 h at 30 °C (data not shown). As a conservative hypothesis, since overexpression either Ssa1p or yeast Ran protects the nucleus, we propose that interruption of membrane traffic sequesters or inactivates Ssa proteins, which are known to be critical for import (45Shulga N. Roberts P. Gu Z. Spitz L. Tabb M. Nomura M. Goldfarb D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 46Lamian V. Small G. Feldherr C. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 228: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) (Fig.4). Evidence consistent with there being a reduction of levels of free Ssa proteins in sec mutants is provided by the induction of transcription from the HSR reporter plasmid, considering that reduction of free Hsp70/Ssa protein levels is known to induce a HSR (44Craig E. Gross C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 135-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). 2We have also obtained evidence of a functional interaction between Ssa1p and the Ran cycle; overexpression of Ssa1p suppresses the protein relocalization seen in Ran-GEF mutants (mtr1/prp20), and the allele specificity of this suppression is the same as for Cnr1p (yeast Ran) suppression ofmtr1/prp20 mutants (19Ferrigno P. Posas F. Koepp D. Saito H. Silver P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5606-5614Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). This is consistent with biochemical observations of association between these proteins in animal cells. Several previous studies have also implicated Hsp70 proteins in nuclear import. Despite these indications of Ssa protein involvement, mere loss of Ssa function in ssa1 and hsf1 strains does not inhibit import or relocate nuclear proteins at 37 °C. We therefore propose that interruption of membrane traffic must also cause other events that are functionally linked to components of the Ran cycle,e.g. phosphorylation of critical substrates. Judging from our observations of protection by Hog1p and the recent report that protein kinase C (but not Hog1p or cAMP-dependent protein kinase) is required forsec perturbation of the nucleus (8Nierras C. Warner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13235-13241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), Hog1p and PKC paths play opposing roles, possibly acting on the same targets. We suggest that subsequent loss of Ran cycle function then inhibits protein import and that inhibition of import leads to relocation of nuclear proteins and therefore inhibits transcription. Once relocation of nuclear proteins begins, if key factors that are needed for import are also perturbed, the process may accelerate. The cycloheximide sensitivity of nuclear perturbation by secmutants may reflect a need for ongoing synthesis of some key protein (s), e.g. a protein that activates PKC. Since Hsp70 proteins participate in conformational maturation of newly synthesized proteins (47Bush G. Meyer D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1229-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 48Eggers D. Welch W. Hansen W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1559-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 49Pfund C.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), an alternate possibility is that Hsp70 proteins are most available for import when protein synthesis is inhibited. Thus, in the presence of cycloheximide, although additional Ssa proteins are not synthesized, ambient levels may remain sufficient to protect the nucleus. There may also be a specific molecular link between vesicular transport and nucleocytoplasmic transport. For example, both Sec13p and one ER membrane protein interact with nucleoporins (50Siniossoglou S. Wimmer C. Rieger M. Doye V. Tekotte H. Weise C. Emig S. Segref A. Hurt E. Cell. 1996; 84: 265-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 51Ho A. Raczniak G. Ives E. Wente S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 9: 355-373Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar), a member of the importin β superfamily is implicated in both protein secretion and nuclear transport (52Chow T. Ash J. Dignard D. Thomas D. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 709-719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 53Rout M. Blobel G. Aitchison J. Cell. 1997; 89: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), and mutations in splicing factors can inhibit vesicular transport (54Chen E. Frand A. Chitouras E. Kaiser C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7139-7146Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Since GTPases of the Ras superfamily are critical for both vesicular transport and nuclear transport (55Novick P. Zerial M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 496-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar,56Nimnual A. Yatsula B. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1998; 279: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), it is also of interest that proteins have been identified which interact with both Ran and Rabs (57Vithalani K. Parent C. Thorn E. Penn M. Larochelle D. Devreotes P. de Lozanne A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 8: 3095-3106Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Moreover, at least one Rab protein and Hsp70 interact with stress signaling paths (58Ren M. Zeng J. Lemos-Chiarandini C. Rosenfeld M. Adesnik M. Sabatini D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5151-5155Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 59Gabai V. Meriin A. Mosser D. Caron A. Rits S. Shifrin V. Sherman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18033-18037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). There are other circumstances in which nucleocytoplasmic transport is perturbed or nuclear proteins relocate to the cytoplasm, perhaps because of inhibition of protein import. Thus, several viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of animal cells relocate specific nuclear proteins to the cytoplasm and the M protein of vesicular stomatitis virus inhibits nucleocytoplasmic transport, which depends on Ran (60Her L.-S. Lund E. Dahlberg J. Science. 1997; 276: 1845-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar).

The present study shows that the TCR and CD3 components follow different fates accompanying their constitutive internalization. Although the CD3 moiety is recycled to the cell surface, the TCR heterodimer is degraded and replaced by newly synthesized chains. Since the TCR heterodimer cannot reach the cell membrane on its own, we propose a model in which recycling CD3 is transported along a retrograde pathway to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it associates with newly made TCR. Interestingly, engagement of the TCR·CD3 complex by superantigen resulted not only in the down-regulation of the TCR and CD3 components but also caused a transient stabilization of the TCR heterodimer. This suggests that TCR engagement diverts the TCR heterodimer from a degradation to a recycling pathway. Contrary to CD3, the intracellular fate of the TCR heterodimer is thus regulated, providing a mechanism for rapidly replacing nonfunctional TCR during intrathymic development of T cells.

T cell receptor endoplasmic reticulum immune receptor tyrosine-based activation motif protein kinase C S. aureus enterotoxin B trans-Golgi network: MHC, major histocompatibility complex phosphate-buffered saline polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis T cells respond to antigen via a polypeptide complex composed of the ligand binding T cell receptor (TCR)1 α and β chains (or γ and δ in γδ T cells) and the CD3 subunits CD3γ, CD3δ, CD3ε, and CD3ζ (1Clevers H. Alarcón B. Wileman T. Terhorst C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 629-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 2Malissen B. Schmitt-Verhulst A.M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1993; 5: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Unlike the TCR chains, the CD3 components have long cytoplasmic tails that are responsible for the association with cytoplasmic-signaling proteins. These association properties are mediated, at least in part, by a double tyrosine and leucine motif present in a single copy in the CD3γ, -δ, and -ε chains and in three copies in CD3ζ (3Reth M. Nature. 1989; 338: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). This immune receptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated during T cell activation (reviewed in Refs. 4Qian D. Weiss V. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 5Cantrell D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 6Alberola-Ila J. Takaki S. Kerner J.D. Perlmutter R.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 125-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Cross-linking of the TCR·CD3 complex with anti-TCR or anti-CD3 antibodies or its interaction with peptide/MHC and superantigens results in the rapid down-regulation of the complex. Receptor down-regulation is a common phenomenon shared with other membrane receptors with intrinsic or associated tyrosine kinase activity (7Seaman M.N.J. Burd C.G. Emr S.D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 8: 549-556Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It is thought that the internalization of signal transducing receptors could have a dual effect. First, it may contribute to signal transduction by favoring the encounter with intracellular signaling molecules (8Bevan A.P. Drake P.G. Bergeron J.J.M. Posner B.I. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 7: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 9Rothenberg E.V. Science. 1996; 273: 78-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 10Luton F. Legendre V. Gorvel J.P. Schmitt-Verhulst A.M. Boyer C. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3140-3147PubMed Google Scholar). Second, it may contribute to terminating cellular responses by reducing the number of receptors at the cell surface or by uncoupling receptors from membrane-anchored signaling molecules (11Cai Z. Kishimoto H. Brunmark A. Jackson M.R. Petersen P.A. Sprent J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 641-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This latter effect is supported by the observation that TCR·CD3 down-regulation results in a loss of cellular sensitivity to subsequent stimulation (12Zanders E.D. Lamb J.R. Feldmann M. Green N. Beverley P.L.C. Nature. 1983; 303: 625-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 13Ando I. Hariri G. Wallace D. Beverley P. Eur. J.

Immunol. 1996; 26: 2012-2016Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and vice versa, the inhibition of receptor down-regulation by expression of a dominant negative Rab5 mutant leads to enhanced signaling (16André P. Boretto J. Hueber A.O. Régnier-Vigouroux A. Gorvel J.P. Ferrier P. Chavrier P. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5253-5263PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, it is believed that TCR·CD3 internalization plays an important role during T cell activation by allowing serial triggering of multiple TCR·CD3 complexes by a few antigen-MHC complexes (17Valitutti S. Lanzavecchia A. Immunol. Today. 1997; 6: 299-304Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Using a neuraminidase-protection assay, it was shown that the TCR·CD3 complex is constitutively internalized and recycled back to the cell surface (18Krangel M.S. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 1141-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Both antibody-mediated TCR·CD3 cross-linking and phorbol ester treatment increase internalization (18Krangel M.S. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 1141-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 19Minami Y. Samelson L.E. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13342-13347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas phorbol ester treatment only results in increased internalization, ligand-induced stimulation results in increased internalization and degradation (17Valitutti S. Lanzavecchia A. Immunol. Today. 1997; 6: 299-304Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 18Krangel M.S. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 1141-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 20Boyer C. Auphon N. Luton F.

Alcover A. Res. Immunol. 1997; 148: 225-239Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Not all TCR·CD3 chains seem to have the same fate; it has thus been shown that the CD3ζ chain has a more rapid turnover than the other TCR·CD3 subunits (23Ono S. Ohno H. Saito T. Immunity. 1995; 2: 639-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that the TCR heterodimer dissociates from the CD3 complex after stimulation of splenic T cells with anti-CD3 antibodies and is thereafter degraded (24Kishimoto H. Kubo R.T. Yorifuji H. Nakayama T. Asano Y. Tada T. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1997-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this study, we analyzed the fate of the TCR heterodimer and the CD3 complex after superantigen-mediated stimulation. We found that in nonstimulated cells, the TCR heterodimer is constitutively degraded in lysosomes, whereas the CD3 complex remains stable. In superantigen-stimulated cells, the degradation of the TCR heterodimer is transiently halted first, resulting in increased recycling to the cell surface, to become accelerated later. The degraded TCR is continuously replaced by newly synthesized receptors that then associate to recycling CD3. Since the TCR heterodimer cannot reach the cell membrane on its own, we propose a model in which recycling CD3 is retrotransported to the endoplasmic reticulum to associate with newly made TCR. The cell line CH7C17 (TCR Vα1.2, Vβ3.1, CD2low, CD3+, CD4−, CD5+, CD45+, MHCI+, MHCII−) is a Jurkat transfectant expressing the TCR-α and TCR-β chains of the hemagglutinin-specific T cell clone HA 1.7, described previously (25Hewitt R.A. Lamb J.R. Hayball J. Hill M. Owen M.J. O'Hehir R.E. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1493-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This cell line was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum.Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B (SEB) was obtained from Toxin Technology, Inc., (Sarasota, FL). The monoclonal anti-CD3 antibody OKT3 (IgG2a) was purchased from Ortho Diagnostics (Raritan, NJ); the anti-CD3-ε SP34 (IgG3) was a gift of Dr. C. Terhorst (Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital, Boston, MA). The anti-Vβ3 JOVI.3 (IgG2a) and anti-Cβ1 TCR monoclonal antibody JOVI.1 (IgG2a) were generously provided by Dr. M. Owen (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, UK). The hamster monoclonal anti-murine TCR-β antibody H57–597 was a gift from Dr. Ralph Kubo (National Jewish Center, Denver, CO). Fluorescein-labeled anti-mouse IgG1 was from Southern Biotechnology, Inc. (Birmingham, AL). CH7C17 cells (106 cells/ml) were incubated for different time periods at 37 °C in the presence of the various stimuli. Incubations were performed in RPMI medium supplemented with 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4. The cells were then washed twice with PBS, and cell surface expression of TCR·CD3 was assessed by flow cytometry. Cells were stained for 1 h at 4 °C using saturating concentrations of the appropriate murine monoclonal antibodies, washed twice in cold PBS, and incubated for one additional hour with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig. Cells were washed twice with PBS and analyzed in a EPICS-XL flow cytometer (Coulter Immunology, Hialeah, FL). The mean fluorescence intensity was obtained from the recorded data, and the results are expressed as the percentage of the fluorescence intensity of unstimulated cells. Briefly, 150 × 106 cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 300 μl of PBS. The cells were then125I-labeled using the lactoperoxidase method as described previously (26San José E. Sahuquillo G.A. Bragado R. Alarcón B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). After terminating the reaction, the cells were resuspended in RPMI medium supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and divided into 1-ml aliquots. Stimulation was performed in a 37 °C water bath for the indicated periods of time by adding enterotoxin B (10 μg/ml), leaving one sample at 4 °C as control. In some experiments the cells were lysed at this time point in 1% Brij 96, and immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (26San José E. Sahuquillo G.A. Bragado R. Alarcón B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The samples were then resuspended in nonreducing sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE in 13% polyacrylamide gels. In some experiments, to isolate only the molecules present on the surface at each time point, the cells were preincubated with anti-TCR and anti-CD3 antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C, lysed, immunoprecipitated by the addition of protein A/G-Sepharose, and the experiment was finished as above. A total of 150 × 106 cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated for 1 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without cysteine and methionine. [35S]Methionine (0.5 mCi/ml/15 × 106cells) was then added for 45 min at 37 °C. After labeling, the cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated at 4 °C with sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) at 0.5 mg/ml/10 × 106 cells in PBS containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2. The cells were then washed, resuspended in RPMI medium supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, divided into 1-ml aliquots, and stimulated with SEB at 37 °C for the indicated times. The cells were then lysed, and immunoprecipitation was performed as above. After the last wash in immunoprecipitation buffer, the immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by incubation with 20 mm triethylamine, pH 11.7, for 15 min, then neutralized by the addition of Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, to 100 mm. The neutralized samples were diluted 2-fold in 1% Brij 96 immunoprecipitation buffer and were finally precipitated with streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce).The precipitated proteins were subjected to 13% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) by standard procedures. The membrane was blocked in a solution of 10% nonfat dry milk in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was rinsed three times with 100 ml of 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS and incubated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in PBS-Tween for 1 h. After 5 washes with 100 ml of PBS-Tween, the membrane was processed by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) method according to the manufacturer's specifications (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protein bands were quantitated directly from the film in a Computing Densitometer model 300 A Molecular Dynamics. To determine the fate of the TCR and CD3 components of the TCR·CD3 complex after ligand engagement, the Vβ3+ Jurkat cell transfectant CH7C17 was surface-labeled with 125I and incubated at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 10 μg/ml SEB. Cells were lysed in 1% Brij96, and immunoprecipitation was performed with the anti-CD3 antibody OKT3. In the absence of stimulus, the amount of 125I-labeled TCR coprecipitated with the anti-CD3 antibody decreased with incubation time, whereas labeled CD3 was stable (Fig.1 A). Densitometric quantitation of the TCR and CD3δ+ε bands at each time point showed a gradual decline in the TCR·CD3 ratio in the absence of ligation (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, superantigen stimulation resulted in a stabilization of the amount of 125I-labeled TCR associated to CD3 at 15 and 30 min after stimulation (Fig. 1,panels A and B). This stabilization was transient, as stimulation for 60 min resulted in a decrease of the TCR·CD3 ratio to unstimulated levels. Although the experiment shown in Fig. 1 was performed with soluble SEB, similar results were obtained when the superantigen was presented by antigen-presenting cells (data not shown). These results suggest that at 37 °C the TCR dissociates from the CD3 complex and that superantigen stimulation causes a transient stabilization of the association. To determine the validity of these observations using a different cell system as well as different labeling and stimulation procedures, resting murine spleen cells were surface-labeled with biotin at 4 °C and stimulated at 37 °C with 10 μg/ml soluble anti-TCR-β antibody H57-597. After biotinylation, an aliquot of the cells was maintained at 4 °C for 1 h, whereas all other samples were incubated at 37 °C for the same period. The anti-TCR-β stimulus was provided during the last 15 min, during the last 30 min, or for the whole hour of incubation. The cells were lysed in 1% Brij96, and immunoprecipitation was performed with H57–597. As in Fig. 1, the incubation for 1 h at 37 °C in the absence of stimulus resulted in a decrease in the amount of labeled TCR heterodimer recovered as compared with the 4 °C control (Fig.2 A). TCR engagement with anti-TCR-β antibody resulted in stabilization of the biotinylated TCR heterodimer. This was especially clear when the stimulating antibody was added during the last 30 min of incubation. The TCR heterodimer is constitutively degraded in resting spleen T cells, whereas TCR·CD3 engagement results in its transient stabilization (Fig. 2 A). Compared with the TCR heterodimer, the coprecipitated CD3γ, CD3δ, and CD3ε chains were more stable and did not increase upon stimulation with the anti-TCR-β antibody. The relative increase of labeled TCR versus CD3 upon TCR engagement is best seen when the TCR·CD3 ratios are calculated from densitometric scans (Fig.2 B). Unlike the experiment shown in Fig. 1 in which the labeling method used (surface radioiodination) does not allow visualization of CD3ζ, this chain was clearly detected under the conditions used in the experiment shown in Fig. 2. Interestingly, the amount of biotinylated CD3ζ also decreased with incubation at 37 °C. These results nevertheless do not indicate whether the stabilization of the TCR obtained upon ligand-induced stimulation takes place at the cell surface or inside the cell. To follow the fate of the surface-expressed TCR heterodimer, CH7C17 cells were 125I-labeled and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in the absence or presence of SEB. SEB was added during the last 15 min, the last 30 min, or for the whole hour of incubation. After the 37 °C incubation, cells were cooled and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with OKT3 or with the anti-TCR antibody JOVI.1 at saturating concentrations. Cells were lysed in 1% Brij96, and the surface receptors were immunoprecipitated with protein A- or protein G-Sepharose beads. These immunoprecipitates corresponded to proteins on the cell surface at the time of lysis. The supernatants from these immunoprecipitations were subsequently incubated with protein A- or protein G-Sepharose beads previously coated with JOVI.1 or OKT3 to immunoprecipitate internal proteins. A scheme of the procedure is shown in Fig. 3 A. The direct immunoprecipitation of surface-expressed 125I-labeled TCR with JOVI.1 showed an increase of the amounts of labeled TCR in SEB-stimulated samples (Fig. 3 B, 15,30, and 60 min) compared with the unstimulated sample (time 0). In contrast, the amount of coprecipitated CD3δ+ε was comparable in all cases. A similar result was obtained when the iodinated cells were bound to OKT3. Superantigen stimulation resulted in a transient increase in the amount of 125I-labeled TCR associated to CD3, whereas the amount of radiolabeled CD3 was constant (Fig. 3 B). Once surface TCR and CD3 components were immunoprecipitated, the second immunoprecipitation with the anti-TCR and anti-CD3 antibodies should have isolated radiolabeled complexes that had been internalized and were not exposed on the cell surface. The second immunoprecipitation of the unstimulated sample with JOVI.1 showed three protein bands with a relative molecular mass of 42–50 kDa (Fig.3 C) that were not present in the first immunoprecipitate (Fig. 3 B). These proteins may correspond to partial degradation forms of the TCR heterodimer that are found inside the cell. Whereas the intact TCR heterodimer (90 kDa) was not found in the unstimulated sample, it was clearly detected in the three stimulated samples (15, 30, and 60 min) with a maximum in the sample stimulated for 30 min. The second immunoprecipitation with the anti-CD3 antibody showed equivalent levels of CD3 chains in all cases, whereas the amount of coprecipitated TCR heterodimer was higher in the sample stimulated for 30 min. The intermediate TCR degradation products were not coprecipitated with the anti-CD3 antibody, indicating that they are not associated to the CD3 complex. The experiments shown in Fig. 3 suggest that the TCR heterodimer in CH7C17 cells is constitutively internalized and degraded at 37 °C, whereas the CD3 components are spared. Stimulation with superantigen transiently increases the amount of labeled TCR heterodimer on the cell surface. To test whether this effect could be due to inhibition of TCR·CD3 internalization and down-regulation, CH7C17 cells were stimulated with anti-TCR antibody or with superantigen, and the level of TCR and CD3 expression was analyzed by flow cytometry. Both stimuli caused an equivalent decline in surface TCR and CD3 levels, which reached 45% for the superantigen stimulus and 80% for the anti-TCR stimulus (Fig.4). According to these data, the stimulation of the TCR·CD3 complex potentiated TCR down-regulation. These results are in agreement with those of Alcover and co-workers (21Niedergang F. Hémar A. Hewitt R.A. Owen M.J. Dautry-Varsat A. Alcover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12839-12845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), who showed that SEB-induced down-regulation of the TCR·CD3 complex in Jurkat cells resulted from increased internalization. Thus, whereas the net effect of antibody- or superantigen-mediated stimulation was down-regulation of the TCR heterodimer (Fig. 4), the amount of preactivation-labeled TCR increased on the cell surface (Fig.3 B). Both sets of data can be reconciled by postulating that stimulation of the TCR·CD3 complex is accompanied by increased internalization of the TCR and CD3 components but also by increased recycling of the TCR heterodimer to the cell surface, thus diverting the TCR from its constitutive degradation pathway. Degradation of the TCR heterodimer in unstimulated cells was prevented in the presence of the lysosomotropic drug chloroquine (data not shown), suggesting that the TCR is degraded in lysosomes. It is puzzling how the stoichiometry of the TCR·CD3 on the cell surface is maintained constant if the TCR heterodimer is constitutively degraded, whereas the CD3 complex is stable. One possibility is that once dissociated from the internalized TCR heterodimer, recycling CD3 complex could associate with newly synthesized TCR before the complex is reexported to the cell surface. To demonstrate this point, a double labeling experiment was performed. To trace the TCR heterodimer in the exocytic route, CH7C17 cells were first metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 45 min at 37 °C, then cooled and surface-biotinylated at 4 °C. After double labeling, the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and as in Fig. 3, the stimulation with superantigen was performed during the last 15 min, the last 30 min, or for the whole hour of incubation. After stimulation, the cells were lysed in 1% Brij96, and immunoprecipitation was performed with the anti-TCR antibody. These immunoprecipitates should consist of a mixture of internal35S-labeled and surface-biotinylated TCR·CD3 complexes. To isolate the surface complexes, the immunoprecipitates were treated at high pH to elute the bound material, and the supernatant was neutralized and precipitated with streptavidin-Sepharose beads. The precipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. A double image of the membrane was obtained after exposing an x-ray film to show the 35S-labeled proteins and after incubation with streptavidin-peroxidase to show the biotinylated proteins. A scheme of the procedure is shown in Fig.5 A. Compared with the cells maintained at 4 °C, the unstimulated sample incubated for 1 h at 37 °C had a 2-fold lower amount of biotinylated TCR; the stimulation with superantigen (Fig. 5B, left panel,15 and 30 min) transiently stabilized the heterodimer to become completely degraded in 1-h-stimulated cells. In contrast, the amount of TCR-associated-biotinylated CD3 chains remained constant. Unlike the biotin-labeled TCR, the amount of35S-labeled TCR increased 2.9-fold during the incubation at 37 °C without stimulus compared with the cells maintained at 4 °C. The export of the TCR·CD3 complex from the ER calculated for Jurkat cells is slow, with a t 12 of 45 min (27Alarcón B. Berkhout B. Breitmeyer J. Terhorst C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2953-2961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During the 45 min of metabolic labeling, therefore, only a minor fraction of the TCR·CD3 complex had time to reach the surface. It was thus possible that the increase of 35S-labeled TCR in the sample incubated for 1 h at 37 °C without stimulus could be due to increased time, which allowed the labeled complexes to exit the ER and reach the surface. It should nevertheless be borne in mind that all the 35S-labeled TCR shown in Fig. 5 B was precipitated with streptavidin-agarose. Therefore, either the35S-labeled TCR molecules were also directly labeled with biotin or they were associated to biotinylated proteins. Since the increase in 35S-labeled TCR during the incubation at 37 °C without stimulus was concomitant with a decrease in the amount of biotinylated TCR, it can be concluded that newly synthesized TCR becomes associated with CD3 components that are or have been at the cell surface. Of note, although biotinylated CD3δ+ε chains were clearly coprecipitated with the anti-TCR antibody,35S-labeled CD3 was not detected. Indeed, very little35S-labeled CD3δ+ε was detected after direct immunoprecipitation with anti-CD3 antibody (not shown). These data reinforce the idea that the turnover of the TCR heterodimer at the cell surface is much higher than that of the CD3 chains and that internalized and degraded TCR has to be replaced by newly made TCR. In this study, we used surface radioiodination and immunoprecipitation to trace the fate of TCR and CD3 components of the TCR·CD3 complex in unstimulated and superantigen- or anti-TCR-β antibody-stimulated cells. We found that both components have different fates in Jurkat and in murine spleen T cells; whereas the CD3 complex remains stable, the TCR heterodimer is constitutively degraded. On the other hand, TCR·CD3 engagement has a dual effect. It promotes the down-regulation of the TCR and CD3 components and simultaneously increases the amount of prelabeled TCR on the cell surface. TCR stabilization was transient, and longer incubations with superantigen or anti-TCR-β antibody resulted in degradation of the complex. Both phenomena, TCR heterodimer down-regulation and stabilization of prelabeled TCR levels at the cell surface, can be explained if superantigen or antibody stimulation simultaneously caused an increased internalization rate of the TCR·CD3 complex, as has previously been shown (21Niedergang F. Hémar A. Hewitt R.A. Owen M.J. Dautry-Varsat A. Alcover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12839-12845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and an increase in the recycling versusdegradative pathways for the TCR. Although the mechanisms responsible for the latter effect are not yet understood, it is quite likely that the signaling pathways initiated upon TCR·CD3 cross-linking influence protein sorting at the endosomal/lysosomal interface. In this regard, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, which is activated by the TCR·CD3 complex, has been implicated in transport from endosomes to lysosomes (reviewed in Refs. 7Seaman M.N.J. Burd C.G. Emr S.D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 8: 549-556Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar and 28Shepherd P.R. Reaves B.J. Davidson H.W. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 92-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that the expression of a constitutively active form of the Src-family kinase Lck causes the down-regulation of the TCR·CD3 complex and the degradation of the TCR heterodimer and the CD3ζ chain in lysosomes (29D'Oro U. Vacchio M.S. Weissman A.M. Ashwell J.D. Immunity. 1997; 7: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Thus, it is quite likely that this kinase is responsible for the down-regulation and enhanced degradation of the TCR heterodimer that we have observed after long (60 min) stimulations. On the other hand, it has been shown that phorbol esters stimulate the internalization and recycling, rather than degradation, of the TCR·CD3 complex (18Krangel M.S. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 1141-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 22Niedergang F. San José E. Rubin B. Alarcón B. Dautry-Varsat A. Alcover A. Res. Immunol. 1997; 148: 225-239Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar), suggesting that PKC elicits a recycling pathway. Thus, the effects of TCR·CD3 engagement that we have observed, i.e. first a transient increase of TCR recycling to the cell surface followed by increased degradation, could be the result of the sequential intervention of PKC and Lck on the endocytic machinery. Nevertheless, experiments that specifically address this issue need still to be performed. A model for the constitutive- and stimulation-mediated fates of the TCR·CD3 complex is shown in Fig. 6. In unstimulated T cells, the TCR·CD3 complex is constitutively internalized and recycled back to the cell surface, as initially described by Krangel (18Krangel M.S. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 1141-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The CD3 components are efficiently returned to the surface; however, the TCR heterodimer is mostly diverted to lysosomes, where it is degraded. The different fate of the TCR and CD3 moieties of the complex implies that they become dissociated at some point in the endocytic route. Interestingly, this effect was initially described by Kishimoto et al. (24Kishimoto H. Kubo R.T. Yorifuji H. Nakayama T. Asano Y. Tada T. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1997-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) in cells stimulated with anti-CD3 antibodies but not in unstimulated cells. In addition to the TCR·CD3 complex, the B cell receptor is also constitutively internalized, probably as a mechanism to internalize and present antigens. Interestingly, although as with all other ITAM-bearing polypeptides, Igα and Igβ contain two tyrosines that conform to classical tyrosine-based endocytosis signals, only the N-terminal tyrosine of the ITAM of Igα mediates the constitutive internalization of the B cell receptor (30Cassard S. Salamero J. Hanau D. Spehner D. Davoust J. Fridman W.H. Bonnerot C. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1767-1773PubMed Google Scholar). Although the signals responsible for the constitutive internalization of the TCR·CD3 complex have not yet been characterized, it is likely that some tyrosines within the ITAMs of CD3 are involved. Indeed, CD3γ, CD3δ (31Letourneur F. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1992; 69: 1143-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), and CD3ε (32Borroto A. Lama J. Niedergang F. Dautry-Varsat A. Alarcón B. Alcover A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 25-31PubMed Google Scholar) have been shown to contain endocytosis signals within their ITAMs. Nevertheless, other signals such as the double leucine motifs of CD3γ and CD3δ that mediate the PKC-mediated internalization of the TCR·CD3 complex (33Dietrich J. How X. Wegener A.M.K. Geisler C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2156-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) are also potential candidates. To maintain constant levels of the complex, the constitutive dissociation of the intracellular TCR and CD3 endocytic routes makes necessary the existence of a compensatory mechanism that replenishes the degraded TCR with newly synthesized receptor. In this study, we have shown that newly synthesized TCR associates with surface-labeled CD3 (Fig. 5). Although newly made TCR could in principle contact the CD3 complex at the cell surface or in endosomes, it has been shown that free (non-CD3-associated) TCR heterodimer is not exported from the ER in CD3− Jurkat mutants (34Geisler C. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2437-2445PubMed Google Scholar, 35Wegener A.-M. Hou X. Dietrich J. Geisler C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4675-4680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 36Blumberg R.S. Alarcón B. Sancho J. McDermott F.V. L-pez P. Breitmeyer J. Terhorst C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14036-14043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) nor in a human T-cell lymphotrophic virus-I-transformed T cell clone (37De Waal Malefyt R. Yssel H. Spits H. de Vries J.E. Sancho J. Terhorst C. Alarcón B. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 2297-2303PubMed Google Scholar). One may then postulate that newly synthesized TCR·CD3 complex is transported to an endosomal compartment, where it associates with internalized CD3. Alternatively, internalized surface CD3 may be transported to the ER, where it enters in contact with new TCR before it is returned to the cell surface (Fig. 6). If the first possibility were correct, additional assumptions would have to be made, namely that once it reached the endosomal compartment, the recently synthesized TCR·CD3 complex would have to dissociate and the CD3 component be degraded before the newly made TCR becomes associated with recycling CD3. The second possibility, of recycling CD3 reaching the ER, would be simpler. Nevertheless, although this possibility is appealing, the retrograde transport from the cell surface to the ER has not yet been shown for proteins other than certain bacterial toxins (Ref. 38Sandvig K. Garred O. Prydz K. Kozlov J.V. Hansen S.H. van Deurs B. Nature. 1992; 358: 510-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar; reviewed in Ref.39Johannes L. Goud B. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 158-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Notwithstanding, the CD3 subunits contain sequences that potentially can mediate their retrograde transport to the ER. It has been shown that a peptide can be targeted to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) when it is covalently bound to TGN38, a membrane protein that cycles between the TGN and the plasma membrane. The peptide can subsequently be retrotransported to the ER depending on the presence of an ER retrieval signal (40Miesenböck G. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Several proteins, including TGN38, depend on tyrosine-based signals for their localization in the TGN (41Humphrey J.S. Peters P.J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1123-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 42Bos K. Wraight C. Stanley K.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2219-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In this regard, the tyrosine-based sequences contained within the ITAMs of the CD3 subunits could mediate the transport of the CD3 complex to the TGN. In addition, CD3ε contains an ER-retrieval sequence located in its C-terminal tail (43Mallabiabarrena A. Fresno M. Alarcón B. Nature. 1992; 357: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 44Mallabiabarrena A. Jiménez M.A. Rico M. Alarcón B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2257-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) that could promote the retrograde transport of the CD3 complex to the ER. Previous reports describe a high turnover rate for the CD3ζ chain independent of the TCR·CD3 complex (23Ono S. Ohno H. Saito T. Immunity. 1995; 2: 639-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In this study, we have detected the constitutive degradation of surface-expressed CD3ζ in spleen T cells incubated at 37 °C. In most experiments we were not able to trace the fate of individual CD3 chains due to the nature of the antibodies and the labeling methods employed. Although it seems clear that the TCR, CD3 (γ, δ, ε), and CD3ζ components are loosely bound at the cell surface and can be isolated independently from the others (23Ono S. Ohno H. Saito T. Immunity. 1995; 2: 639-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 45Rodrı́guez-Tarduchy G. Sahuquillo A.G. Alarcón B. Bragado R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30417-30425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the down-regulation of the TCR heterodimer paralleled that of the CD3 complex (Fig. 4), suggesting that the fates of TCR and CD3 divert after they have been internalized. The disassembly of multisubunit receptors and the selective degradation of some subunits that follow endocytosis have been previously described for the high affinity interleukin-2 receptor (46Hémar A. Subtil A. Lieb M. Morelon E. Hellio R. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Whereas the interleukin-2 receptor α chain is internalized and recycled to the cell surface, the β and γ chains are degraded. The different fates of the interleukin-2 receptor subunits were explained by the need to maintain extended expression of the high affinity receptor, which contains the recycled interleukin-2 receptor α chain, despite the brief induction of its gene transcription. More difficult to explain is the requirement for the T cell to maintain a constitutive degradation pathway for the TCR moiety of the TCR·CD3 complex while preserving CD3. It may be reminiscent of thymic development, as the TCR heterodimer also has a high turnover rate in immature thymocytes (data not shown). The high turnover of the surface-expressed TCR heterodimer would permit a positive-selecting thymocyte to rapidly replace a nonselected TCR for the products of the rearrangement of the second allele. The stabilization and recycling of the engaged TCR heterodimer to the cell membrane may also aid in replacing the nonfunctional receptor. It would be of interest to determine whether the pre-TCR is also subjected to constitutive degradation. We thank Drs. Michael Owen and Cox Terhorst for kindly providing reagents and Drs.

Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 2nd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar). Modification of potassium channel activity has been implicated in cellular mechanisms of learning and memory. Depending on their specific properties, potassium channels could maintain resting membrane potentials, determine the repolarization phase of action potentials, modulate neurotransmitter/hormone release, modulate firing frequency, and participate in postsynaptic integration (1Hille B.

Theether-à-go-go(EAG)1 potassium channel is unique because mutations in the Drosophila EAGgene have profound effects on more than one type of potassium current (3Wu C. Ganetzky B. Haugland F.N.

Trout W.E. Genetics. 1968; 61: 399-409Crossref Google Scholar). Electrophysiological studies revealed that EAG mutations cause spontaneous repetitive firing in motor axons and elevated transmitter release at the larval neuromuscular junction (3Wu C. Ganetzky B. Haugland F.N. Liu A. Science. 1983; 220: 1076-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). EAG mutant flies have defects in learning (7Griffith L.C. Wang J. Zhong Y. Wu C.-F. Greenspan R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10044-10048Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and in responses to certain odorants (8Dubin A.E. Liles M.M. Harris G.L. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5603-5613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All identified K+ currents in larval muscle were affected by EAG mutations including the fast transient (I A) and delayed non-inactivating (I K) voltage-gated K+ currents, the fast (I CF) and slow (I CS) Ca2+-activated K+currents. Furthermore, mutations in the EAG gene block the modulation of different K+ currents by several signaling pathways (9Zhong Y. Wu C. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 4669-4679Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism how EAG mutations affect different K+ currents has not been defined, however. Interactions between EAG and shaker potassium channels has been tested inXenopus oocytes with conflicting results as to whether these proteins coassemble into functional heteromultimeric channels (10Chen M.L.

It also has been suggested that EAG may act downstream of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II in modulating neuronal plasticity (7Griffith L.C. Wang J. Zhong Y. Wu C.-F. Greenspan R.J.

To explore the regulatory role of EAG, we decided to identify signaling molecules that might associate with EAG protein to receive cellular signals to modulate the function of EAG and possibly other K+ currents. We report here the purification of a protein from rat brain membranes that interacts with rat EAG. We used overlay assays to monitor the purification of EAG-binding proteins and characterized one of several EAG-binding proteins, with an apparent molecular mass of 95 kDa, in further biochemical and electrophysiological experiments. This protein is identical to the recently identified rat epsin (12Chen H. Fre S. Slepnev V.I. Capua M.R. Takei K. Butler M.H. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. Nature. 1998; 394: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), a protein that is similar to theXenopus mitotic phosphoprotein MP90 (13Stukenberg P.T. Lustig K.D. McGarry T.J. King R.W.

When coexpressed in HEK 293 cells, epsin coimmunoprecipitates with EAG and EAG interacts with epsin through its carboxyl-terminal domain. Epsin decelerates both activation and deactivation processes of EAG channels in HEK 293 cells as well as in neuronal NG108-15 cells. Given the multifunctionality of the epsin family of proteins, such as binding to EH (for Eps15 homology; a ∼70 amino acid long protein module (14Wong W.T. Schumacher C. Salcini A.E. Romano A.

The full-length cDNA encoding rat EAG (from Dr. Olaf Pongs) was subcloned into the KpnI andNotI restriction sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). NH2- and COOH-terminal fragments (624 and 1443 base pairs, respectively) of EAG were generated using polymerase chain reaction. These fragments were subcloned into pcDNA3 for use in in vitro translation. Both NH2- and COOH-terminal constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Rat epsin cDNA in pcDNA3.1/His B (Invitrogen) was obtained from Hong Chen and Pietro De Camilli (Yale University) and used in our transfection studies. Overlay assays were performed according to the procedures of Guichet and co-workers (15Guichet A. Copeland J.W.R. Erdelyi M. Hlousek D. Zavorszky P. Ho J. Brown S. Percival-Smith A. Krause H.M.

Briefly, samples were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane filters. Blots were incubated for 60 min (4 °C) with a buffer (AC) containing 10% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 2% (w/v) milk powder, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6). Following quick rinses with AC buffer (without milk), filters were probed with [35S]methionine-labeled EAG for 2 h (4 °C). Probes were generated with the TNT T7 in vitro transcription/translation kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Filters were washed extensively with AC buffer, dried, and exposed to PhosphorImager plates (4–12 h). In some experiments, nitrocellulose filters were probed with a rabbit anti-epsin polyclonal antibody (raised against the DPW and NPF domains of epsin; 1:1000 dilution, from Hong Chen and Pietro De Camilli (Yale University)), followed by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:4000 dilution) and enhanced chemiluminescence detection (NEN Life Science Products Inc.). An affinity purified rabbit anti-EAG antibody (Genemed Synthesis), raised against an EAG peptide (NGSGSGKWEGGPSKNS), was used to immunoprecipitate EAG from transfected 293 cell lysates. Cell lysates were prepared, and proteins were immunoprecipitated as described previously (16Huang X.Y. Morielli A.D. Peralta E.G.

After an initial centrifugation step (850 × g, 10 min), cell membranes were sedimented (100,000 × g, 60 min). Membrane proteins were extracted by 15 ml of homogenization buffer containing 2.5% CHAPS (w/v), followed by centrifugation (100,000 × g, 60 min). Proteins (160 mg) from the resulting supernatant were sequentially precipitated with 10 and 25% (w/v) ammonium sulfate (AS). Precipitated proteins were resuspended in 20 ml of buffer (RB) containing 20 mm HEPES, 20 mm NaCl (pH 7.4), 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 16 μg/ml benzamidine, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.25% (w/v) CHAPS. Following overlay analysis, 25% AS-precipitated samples were concentrated using a 10-kDa nominal molecular mass limit filter (Millipore) and applied (0.3 mg of proteins) to a Mono-Q anion exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Proteins were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (100–750 mm), collected in 0.5 ml/min fractions and frozen in liquid nitrogen (storage at −80 °C). Samples of these fractions were analyzed by overlay assay, silver, and Coomassie Blue staining. All assays were performed at least three times, and representative data are shown in the figures. Internal sequence analysis was performed on proteins excised from an SDS-PAGE gel, based on the procedures of Fernandez et al. (21Fernandez J. Andrews L. Mische S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 112-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins were digested with trypsin and separated by microbore high performance liquid chromatography purification. Following mass spectrometric analysis, one peptide fragment was subjected to sequencing by Edman degradation. Both NG108-15 and HEK 293 cells were grown as described previously (16Huang X.Y. Morielli A.D. Peralta E.G. Cell. 1993; 75: 1145-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). For transient expression of epsin or EAG, cells grown in 10-cm (for biochemistry) or 35-mm dishes (for electrophysiology) were transfected, using the calcium phosphate method, with 10 μg and 2 μg of cDNA, respectively. For electrophysiological experiments, 0.2 μg of green fluorescent protein encoding cDNA was co-transfected with epsin and EAG. Coexpression of green fluorescent protein did not alter EAG channel activity and kinetics. Stable epsin and EAG expressing HEK 293 cell lines were also established by selection with G418 (0.5 mg/ml). Potassium currents from single voltage-clamped cells were recorded (at room temperature) in the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique using an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments Inc.)

The current signal was filtered with a low pass Bessel filter (1–2 KHz), digitally acquired at 5–10 KHz and analyzed using pCLAMP 6.0 (Axon Instruments Inc.). When necessary, series resistance errors were compensated by 70–80%. While recording current-voltage relationships (employing step depolarizing pulses from a holding potential of −80 mV) leakage and capacitative currents were subtracted by a P/4 routine. In experiments where hyperpolarizing pulses (from a 0 mV holding potential) were used to assess the deactivation, and subsequent reactivation properties of EAG currents, leak subtraction was performed off-line (by scaling leak currents obtained with a step to −80 mV from −70 mV). Due to technical limitations, we were unable to construct the relative G/V curves by measuring tail currents with higher concentrations of extracellular potassium. Steady-state conductance was calculated using the following equation, G=I/(V−Ek)Equation 1 where I is the current measured at the end of the depolarizing voltage pulse, V is the membrane potential, andE k was −78.9 mV in our experiments. The voltage dependence of EAG channel activation was determined by measuring currents elicited by voltage steps to 0 mV, from various (−110 to −10 mV) prepulses (23Ludwig J. Terlau H. Wunder F. Bruggemann A. Pardo L.A. Marquardt A. Stuhmer W. Pongs O. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4451-4458Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The resulting currents were best described by the sum of two exponentials, I=IF[1-exp(t/τF)]n+IS[1-exp(t/τS)]mEquation 2 where I F and I S is the amplitude of the fast and slow current components, respectively. The fast component could be best described with first-order exponentials. The slow component behaved similarly (m = 1), except in the −80 to −110 mV prepulse potential range, where it could be fitted only by a second-order exponential. In all cases, the exponential functions were extrapolated back to the time point when the voltage change occurred. The normalized conductance-voltage relationship (Fig. 3, Band C) and the relationship describing the proportion of the current activated in the slow mode versus voltage (Figs.4 E and 6 B) were described with Boltzmann functions, Y=1/(1+exp[(Vmid−V)/k]Equation 3 where Y denotes either the normalized conductance (G/G 60), or the proportion of the current in the slowly activating mode (I S /[I S +I F ]), V mid is the midpoint potential (in mV), and k is the slope factor (in mV).Figure 4Epsin alters the activation kinetics of EAG channels. A, voltage-dependent activation of EAG channels with or without epsin. Representative leak-subtracted potassium currents are shown for EAG- (top) and EAG + epsin-transfected (bottom) HEK 293 cells. Currents were evoked by depolarizing pulses to 0 mV, from various (−110 to −10 mV; 1-s duration) prepulses in 10 mV increments. B, the time necessary to reach 80% of maximum current (I max) values (in experiments depicted inA) are plotted as a function of prepulse (EAG: filled circles; EAG + epsin: open circles). Values at each voltage were compared using unpaired Student's t test (n ≥ 6), and deemed significantly different ifp < 0.05 (indicated by asterisks).C and D, current traces of activating K+ channels in HEK 293 cells transfected with EAG (C) or EAG + epsin (D), in response to a voltage step from −60 to 0 mV. The traces were fitted with two exponentials (the continuos line depicts the slow component). From such fits, the amplitude of the fast (I F ) and slow (I S ) current components were calculated.E, the fraction of the slow current component (I S /[I S +I F ]) is altered in EAG + epsin (open circles) versus EAG expressing HEK 293 cells (filled circles). The relative contribution of the slow component was calculated from the biexponential fits (see Cand D) of the currents evoked from various prepulse voltages (V) to 0 mV. Results are from the same cells as inB. Mean values (n ≥ 6) were approximated with Boltzmann functions. Vertical bars, when bigger than symbols, represent S.E. F, slow (squares) and fast (circles) time constants of K+ channel activation are not significantly different in EAG (filled symbols) and in EAG + epsin-transfected (open symbols) HEK 293 cells (n ≥ 6; p < 0.05). Values for time constants were obtained from exponential fits to data described in E. Fast activation was only observed in the −10 to −60 mV prepulse voltage range. Data points (mean ± S.E.) were connected with straight lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6Effect of epsin on EAG potassium currents in NG108-15 cells. A, epsin delays EAG channel activation in NG108-15 cells transfected with EAG + epsin (open circles), when compared with cells transfected with EAG alone (filled circles). Data represented here were recorded and analyzed using the same methods as described in the legend to Fig.4 B (n ≥ 6). Asterisks denote values, which are significantly different (p < 0.05) between the groups. B, epsin changes the activation kinetics of EAG channels in transfected NG108-15 cells. Plot of the relative proportion of channels in the slow activating mode at various prepulse voltages in EAG (filled circles) and EAG + epsin expressing cell lines. The same protocols were used as in Fig. 4 E(n ≥ 4). Data values were approximated with Boltzmann functions. C, the rate of deactivation of EAG channels is decreased by the coexpression of epsin in undifferentiated NG108-15 cells. Time to reach 80% of minimum current values (I min) were measured and plotted as in Fig.5 B. Filled and open circles represent averaged values from EAG- and EAG + epsin-transfected NG108-15 cells, respectively (n ≥ 4). Error bars are S.E. of mean. D, endogenous epsin levels are substantially up-regulated upon differentiation in NG108-15 cells. Cells were differentiated for 8 days by supplementing the serum-free growth media with prostaglandin E1 (10 μm) and theophylline (1 mm). Proteins (160 μg loaded in each lane), from whole cell lysates of differentiated and undifferentiated NG108-15 cells, were separated on an 8% gel by SDS-PAGE, transferred, and probed separately with anti-epsin (1:1000) and, as a control, anti-actin (1:5000) antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Data values were compared using Student's t test and considered significantly different if p < 0.05. To identify proteins interacting with EAG protein, we used an overlay assay to monitor the purification of potential EAG-binding proteins. Rat brain membranes were chosen as starting material because brain expresses EAG most abundantly (23Ludwig J. Terlau H. Wunder F. Bruggemann A. Pardo L.A. Marquardt A. Stuhmer W. Pongs O. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4451-4458Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled EAG polypeptide was used as probe to identify proteins that bind to EAG. In vitro translated rat EAG polypeptide has an apparent molecular mass of ∼108 kDa when assessed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig.1 A) or Western blot with an anti-EAG antibody (results not shown). Several proteins from rat brain membranes interacting with the EAG probe (Fig. 1 C). We chose the ∼95-kDa protein, which had the highest intensity in overlay autoradiography, for large-scale purification. Brain membrane proteins were first fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation. Putative EAG-binding protein(s) were precipitated by 25% ammonium sulfate (25% AS; Fig. 1 C, right), these proteins were further purified with ion-exchange chromatography. Two fractions (numbers 22 and 23) contained the ∼95-kDa EAG-binding protein (Fig. 1 D, left). After SDS-PAGE separation, the band containing the ∼95-kDa protein was excised and subjected to mass spectrometry and amino acid sequencing analyses (see “Experimental Procedures”). The following peptide sequence, determined by microsequencing, was searched against the protein data base: NIVHNYSEAEIK. A recently identified Eps15-interacting 94-kDa protein, epsin, contained this peptide sequence at its NH2 terminus (amino acids 12–23) (12Chen H. Fre S. Slepnev V.I. Capua M.R. Takei K. Butler M.H. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. Nature. 1998; 394: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The molecular structure of epsin is depicted in Fig.2 A. To determine that this EAG-binding protein is epsin, we analyzed all fractions at all stages of purification with an anti-epsin antibody (Fig. 2 B), which was raised against an overlapping region of the DPW and NPF domains of epsin (Ref. 12Chen H. Fre S. Slepnev V.I. Capua M.R. Takei K. Butler M.H. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. Nature. 1998; 394: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar; Fig. 2 A). Beforehand, the antibody was tested in HEK 293 cells, which were transfected with His-tagged rat epsin cDNA. This antibody recognized a distinct ∼105-kDa band in epsin-transfected cells (Fig. 2 B, left, single arrow), and a band (∼95 kDa) in brain membranes (Fig. 2 B, left, double arrow). Furthermore, the 95-kDa band was detected by this antibody in the 25% AS fraction and in fraction 23 (IEX number 23) of the ion-exchange column (Fig. 2 B, right), while it was absent in untransfected HEK 293 cells and in the supernatant (25% Sup) of the protein fraction precipitated by 25% AS (Fig. 2 B). An additional band (∼83 kDa) was present in all fractions tested, except in IEX number 23, which is probably due to antibody cross-reaction with another protein (Fig. 2 B). Therefore, the ∼95-kDa EAG-binding protein purified from rat brain membrane is epsin. To determine if there is anin vivo association between epsin and EAG, we performed coimmunoprecipitation studies. In epsin and EAG co-transfected HEK 293 cells, we found that an anti-EAG antibody was able to immunoprecipitate epsin from transfected cell lysates (Fig. 2 C, left). As a control, no epsin was detected in immunoprecipitates with preimmune serum (Fig. 2 C, left). In cell lysates from epsin or EAG singlely transfected cells, no epsin was detected in the immunoprecipitates with an anti-EAG antibody (Fig. 2 C, left, and data not shown). Furthermore, epsin from rat brain extracts was co-immunoprecipitated with anti-EAG antibody (Fig. 2 C, left). Therefore, together with the above results, EAG associates with epsin in vivo, as well as in vitro. To further confirm the interaction and to determine whether the amino- or carboxyl-terminal domains of EAG protein are involved in this interaction, we tested the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains of EAG for their interaction with epsin. The GST fusion protein of the COOH-terminal region (residues from 482 to 962) of EAG specifically pulled down epsin from rat brain homogenates, as evidenced by Western blot (Fig. 2 C, right). As control, GST alone or GST fusion protein of the NH2-terminal domain of EAG did not pull down epsin from rat brain extracts (Fig. 2 C, right). In addition, both NH2- and COOH-terminal domains of EAG were translatedin vitro and used as probes in overlay assays on brain proteins. The same ∼95-kDa protein band, previously identified by the full-length EAG probe, was detected with the COOH-terminal fragment (Fig. 2 D, arrow), but not with the NH2-terminal fragment of EAG (Fig. 2 D). Thus, the carboxyl-terminal region of EAG mediates the interaction with epsin. To investigate possible physiological effects of epsin on EAG channels, whole cell voltage-clamp technique was used to compare potassium currents through EAG channels in the absence or presence of epsin. As reported before, EAG can function as a structural subunit, when expressed heterologously in cell lines. Transfection of HEK 293 cells with EAG plasmid DNA yielded robust channel expression. Cells transfected with epsin alone did not generate any currents (results not shown). Currents were evoked by depolarizing to various potentials (from −70 to +60 mV) from a −80 mV holding potential. At +40 mV the outward, non-inactivating currents had similar steady-state amplitudes of 3637.2 ± 940.4 pA (n = 8) and 2600.7 ± 692.8 pA (n= 5) in cells transfected with EAG and EAG + epsin, respectively. The midpoint of activation (V mid) was shifted to the right (p < 0.05) in EAG + epsin-transfected cells, as compared with cells expressing EAG alone (Fig.3B; V mid = 19.6 ± 3.7 mV, n = 5, for EAG + epsin transfected cells, and V mid = −0.7 ± 3.5 mV,n = 8, for EAG-transfected cells). The slope factor (k) of the conductance-voltage relationship was not significantly different in these two cell lines (k = 22.3 ± 3.6 mV, n = 8 and k = 18.2 ± 1.2 mV, n = 5 in EAG and EAG + epsin transfected cells, respectively). The epsin-mediated change in the voltage dependence of activation seems to be specific to EAG. When we examined the effect of epsin on another K+ channel, Kv1.2, epsin did not bind (results not shown), and the normalized steady-state conductance-voltage relationship was not affected (Fig. 3 C): Kv1.2-transfected (V mid = 16.5 ± 2.8 mV,k = 13.1 ± 0.7 mV, n = 5); and Kv1.2 + epsin-transfected HEK 293 cells (V mid = 23.0 ± 2.9 mV, k = 13.1 ± 2.2 mV, n = 5; Fig. 3 C). Epsin also alters the gating kinetics of EAG channels, as epsin delays the activation of EAG channels in co-transfected HEK 293 cells, as compared with channels in cells expressing EAG alone (Fig.4). A significant delay was observed in the prepulse potential range of −30 to −70 mV (Fig. 4 B;n ≥ 6). The time course of activation was best fitted with two exponentials (for details see “Experimental Procedures”), indicating the presence of a fast (τ F = ∼7 ms) and a slow (τ S = ∼220 ms) current component (Fig. 4, C andD). The relative contribution of the slow component is plotted and fitted with Boltzmann functions (Fig. 4 E). The midpoint potential of the slow current component was shifted to more depolarized voltages in EAG + epsin expressing cells (fromV mid = −67.2 ± 2.5 mV, n= 6 to V mid = −48.7 ± 3.6 mV,n = 7), with no effect on the slope factor (k = 4.6 ± 1.0 mV, n = 6 andk = 5.6 ± 3.6 mV, n = 7, respectively).

Rhodanese, which was isolated from bovine liver, is a single polypeptide having a molecular mass of 33 kDa containing 293 amino acids (3Ploegman J.H. Drent G. Kalk K.H. Hol W.G. Heinrikson R.L. Keim P. Weng L. Russell J. Nature. 1978; 273: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The x-ray studies showed that the 33-kDa enzyme consists of two equal-sized globular domains: the N-terminal domain, comprising residues 1–142, and the C-terminal domain, comprising residues 159–293; the connecting loop comprises residues 143–158 (3Ploegman J.H.

After synthesis, rhodanese is not processed beyond removal of the initiating methionine. Non-amino acid components are not required for the native active structure (3Ploegman J.H. Drent G. Kalk K.H.

In its active form, all four of the rhodanese sulfhydryl groups are reduced (1Ploegman J.H. Drent G. Kalk K.H. Hol W.G. J. Mol.

Nature. 1978; 273: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Therefore, all of the sequence information needed for folding and functions is present in the isolated protein. These properties have contributed to making rhodanese an attractive model for studying protein folding and for examining the interaction with chaperonins or heat shock proteins (4Luo G.X. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10246-10251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The majority of the proteins imported into mitochodria have their N-terminal signal sequences removed proteolytically. However, rhodanese retains the N-terminal signal sequence after it is imported into the mitochodrial matrix (5Hartl F.U. Pfanner N. Nicholson D.W. Neupert W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 1-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been proposed that the N-terminal signal sequence might play an important role in the structural integrity, folding, and function of rhodanese (4Luo G.X. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10246-10251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Trevino R.J. Tsalkova T. Kramer G. Hardesty B. Chirgwin J.M. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol.

When glutamic acid 17 was replaced with proline, the point-mutated rhodanese (E17P) had a specific activity similar to that of the wild type, but it has lower stability toward urea and decreased ability of refolding in vitro (4Luo G.X.

The N-terminal sequence was further investigated, by constructing rhodanese mutants with various N-terminal deletions. Rhodanese with deletion of 9 amino acid residues was inactivated by lower concentration of urea and could not be refolded efficiently (6Trevino R.J. Tsalkova T. Kramer G. Hardesty B. Chirgwin J.M. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27841-27847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Rhodanese species with deletions of 10–23 amino acids were expressed as inactive species and quickly eliminated from the cells (6Trevino R.J. Tsalkova T. Kramer G. Hardesty B. Chirgwin J.M. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27841-27847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), indicating that N-terminal sequence has a major role in maintaining the structural stability and function of rhodanese. Unfolding and refolding of rhodanese may be achieved through intermediate structures, but the natures of any intermediates are not clear. Proteases have been utilized to proteolyze rhodanese in order to map the exposed sites of rhodanese and to understand some aspects of its three-dimensional conformation (4Luo G.X. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10246-10251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Merrill G.A. Butler M. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol.

When rhodanese was oxidized, proteases, including subtilisin, chymotrypsin, V8, and trypsin, produced bands equivalent to the size of a rhodanese domain, indicating that rhodanese exhibits conformational change with oxidation and the interdomain tether of rhodanese is exposed and become susceptible to protease digestion (9Horowitz P.M. Bowman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14544-14548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, under acidic conditions, digestion with pepsin revealed loosening of the structure with the production of species that could have been subdomains of rhodanese (10Horowitz P.M. Xu R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19464-19469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In other experiments, native rhodanese was digested with immobilized trypsin and produced a significant amount of 31-kDa species. The N terminus of the 31-kDa band indicated that rhodanese was cleaved at residue 45 (7Merrill G.A. Butler M. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15611-15620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the absence of this N-terminal region did not increase proteolytic susceptibility of the rhodanese tether region. The sequence of rhodanese would indicate that the interdomain tether of rhodanese should be susceptible to proteolytic attack, but attempts to proteolyze this region in native rhodanese have been unsuccessful, presumably because of conformational constraint imposed (9Horowitz P.M. Bowman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14544-14548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Horowitz P. Falksen K. J. Biol.

This is confirmed by the x-ray results, which show that the sequence 143–158 is tightly bound to the surface of the protein. We investigated the structural integrity of rhodanese by loosening the tertiary structure with a various concentration of urea and assessment using tricine-based SDS-PAGE, which resolves low molecular weight peptides (13Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10460) Google Scholar). The conformational change of rhodanese was examined with respect to activity, fluorescence, and tryptic digestion with time course. With the methods presented here, we could produce an unfolding condition in which tryptic digestion released the two globular domains of rhodanese, which were subsequently digested into smaller peptides. This process was associated with inactivation as well as significant increase of the hydrophobic exposure of rhodanese. These data were further supported by the N-terminal analysis of the digested peptides. These results demonstrate that rhodanese unfolds initially by disrupting the interactions between its two globular domains, which then open further to reveal possible subdomains. Urea was from Bio-Rad. SDS, acrylamide, and bis-acrylamide were from Fischer Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA). Silver nitrate and sodium thiosulfate was from Aldrich. The gel apparatus was purchased from Idea Scientific (Minneapolis, MN). 1,1′-Bi(4-anilino)naphthalene-5,5′-disulfonic acid (bis-ANS)1 was from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR).

Amido Black was from ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc (Cleveland, OH). Other chemicals were from Sigma. Recombinant bovine rhodanese was purified as described previously and stored at −70 °C as a crystalline suspension in 1.8 m ammonium sulfate containing 1 mm sodium thiosulfate (14Miller D.M. Delgado R. Chirgwin J.M. Hardies S.C. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4686-4691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rhodanese was desalted on a G-50 column before use (15Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2891-2899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rhodanese concentrations were determined using a value of A 0.1% 280 nm = 1.75. Rhodanese activity was measured by a colorimetric method based on the absorbance at 460 nm of the complex formed between ferric ion and the reaction product, thiocyanate (16Sörbo B. Acta Chem. Scand. 1953; 7: 1129-1136Crossref Google Scholar). bis-ANS fluorescence measurements were performed using an SLM 48000S fluorometer (SLM Instruments, Urbana, IL). The excitation wavelength was 399 nm, and the emission was recorded as a spectrum from 450 to 550 nm. The excitation and emission slit widths were 1 nm. The collection of recorded spectra showed that the maximum intensity of the bis-ANS fluorescence was observed at ∼500 nm (data not shown). Therefore, the data were plotted as the fluorescence intensities obtained with the excitation 399 nm and the emission at 500 nm. The scanned samples consisted of 10 μg/ml of rhodanese, 10 μm bis-ANS, 200 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 50 mm sodium thiosulfate with 0, 3, 4.25, or 6 murea. The scanning was carried out at several times between 0 and 185 min as indicated under “Results.” Rhodanese was added to the unfolding solution at t = 0. Rhodanese (final concentration, 0.2 mg/ml) was unfolded for 3 h at 23 °C in buffers containing 200 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 50 mm sodium thiosulfate with either 0, 3, 4.25, or 6m urea. The unfolded rhodanese was proteolyzed with 1% trypsin (w/w) at 23 °C. The incubation times are described in the legends of Figs. 3 and 4. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the samples were boiled for 5 min. The tryptic digestion was performed with both sulfur-free rhodanese (E form) and sulfur-substituted rhodanese (ES form). The E form was prepared by adding a 5-fold molar excess of cyanide to the ES form, as described previously (17Wasylewski Z. Horowitz P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 701: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).Figure 4Kinetic of tryptic digestion of the 4.25m urea-unfolded rhodanese. The ES form and the E form were examined for tryptic digestion. The E form was prepared with addition of 5-fold excess of cyanide. Rhodanese (0.2 mg/ml) was equilibrated with 4.25 m urea unfolding buffer, as described in Fig. 3. Rhodanese was then digested with 1% trypsin for various times.

Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10460) Google Scholar) for resolving low molecular weight peptides. Gels were cast with resolving gel (16.5% T, 3% C), spacer gel (10% T, 3% C), and stacking gel (4% T, 3% C) according to the published procedure. The gel dimensions were 10 cm (height) × 10 cm (width) × 0.76 mm (depth). Gels were silver-stained (18Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3736) Google Scholar). After SDS-PAGE, the separated peptides were transferred to Immobilon-P membrane, using the TE77 SemiPhor transfer unit (Hoefer Scientific Instruments Co, San Francisco, CA). The transfer was carried out at the constant current of 48 mA for 40 min with anode buffer 1 (0.3 m Tris at pH 10.4, 20% methanol), anode buffer 2 (25 mm Tris at pH 10.4, 20% methanol), and cathode buffer (10 mm CAPS at pH 11, 10% methanol). The transfer protocol is described in the Millipore Immobilon-P Transfer Membrane User Guide. After the transfer, the membrane was stained with 0.1% Amido Black dissolved in 10% methanol and 2% acetic acid and destained in 50% methanol with 7% acetic acid. The stained bands were cut from the membrane and subjected to ten cycles of N-terminal amino acid sequencing using the PE Applied Biosystems 491cLC protein sequencer with the Applied Biosystems 785A programmable absorbance detector. The sequences obtained were compared with the known rhodanese sequence (3Ploegman J.H. Drent G. Kalk K.H. Hol W.G. Heinrikson R.L. Keim P. Weng L. Russell J. Nature. 1978; 273: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Rhodanese was treated with 0, 3, 4.25, and 6m urea. Rhodanese activity was measured during 2 h of equilibration with urea. As shown in Fig.1, activity was not significantly perturbed when rhodanese was treated with 0 (closed circles) or 3 (open circles) m urea. With time, the rhodanese activities were reduced to approximately 90% of the original activity because of rhodanese oxidation. Rhodanese was completely inactivated with both 4.25 and 6 m urea equilibration. With 6 m urea (Fig. 1, open squares), the activity was completely lost in 2 min, whereas rhodanese was slowly inactivated (t 12 = ∼20 min) by treatment with 4.25m urea (closed squares). Rhodanese was treated with 0, 3, 4.25, and 6m urea, and the exposure of the hydrophobic surfaces was assessed with the fluorescence probe, bis-ANS. The bis-ANS fluorescence increases when it binds to hydrophobic sites. The bis-ANS fluorescence intensity was measured at times between 0 and 185 min as indicated in Fig. 2. Unfolding with 0 (Fig. 2,closed circles) and 3 (open circles)m urea did not significantly increase the fluorescence intensity, indicating that hydrophobic surfaces of rhodanese were not significantly exposed with those urea concentrations. The bis-ANS fluorescence dramatically increased with time when rhodanese was treated with 4.25 m urea (Fig. 2, closed squares). This increase in fluorescence intensity indicated that rhodanese was partially unfolded and the hydrophobic surface was increased. In contrast, the bis-ANS fluorescence was not increased when the enzyme was unfolded with 6 m urea (Fig. 2, open squares). This indicated that rhodanese was completely unfolded and contained very few organized hydrophobic surfaces. Rhodanese was equilibrated in buffers with 0, 3, 4.25, and 6 m urea for 3 h at 23 °C. Rhodanese was then digested with trypsin for 30 min, and the digested rhodanese was subjected to tricine-based SDS-PAGE, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 3, rhodanese was not susceptible to digestion when it was equilibrated with 0 or 3 m urea, indicating that rhodanese structure was still compact and thereby resistant to proteolytic attack by trypsin. When the enzyme was treated with 4.25 m urea, rhodanese became susceptible to trypsin and was digested to produce distinct fragments, which were highly reproducible. Trypsin did not efficiently proteolyze rhodanese unfolded in 6 m urea because trypsin is susceptible to denaturation by 6 m urea. Subtilisin, a nonspecific protease, is more resistant to urea denaturation and digested 6 murea-unfolded rhodanese to only small fragments, and it also produced a discrete high molecular weight fragment with 4.25 m urea (8Horowitz P.M. Butler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2500-2504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2T. Shibatani, G. Kramer, B. Hardesty, and P. M. Horowitz, submitted for publication. Digestion of 4.25 m urea-unfolded rhodanese by trypsin was investigated at 0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 60 min to determine whether particular fragments appear in the early phase of tryptic digestion or whether all digested fragments seen in Fig. 3 appear simultaneously. Fig. 4 shows the time course of tryptic digestion of 4.25 m urea-equilibrated rhodanese. The kinetic experiments were performed with two different forms of the enzyme, the ES form and the E form. As shown in Fig. 4, no significant difference was observed between the digestion patterns of the two forms. Four major bands appeared after 1 min incubation with trypsin, and then other fragments started appearing. The four bands are approximately 21.2, 17, 15.9, and 12 kDa. Because those four major bands appeared in the early phase, identification of these tryptic cleavage sites could indicate how the rhodanese structure was partially unfolded. After rhodanese was digested with trypsin, samples were subjected to tricine-based SDS-PAGE, and the digested fragments on the gel were transferred to Immobilon-P membrane. The fragments were subjected to N-terminal protein sequencing. The N terminus of the 17-kDa band was the same as that of intact rhodanese. The sequence information as well as the size of the band indicated that the 17-kDa band represents the N-terminal domain of rhodanese. The N-terminal sequence of the 15.9-kDa band showed that cleavage occurred before Ser-159, the first amino acid of the C-terminal domain, providing strong evidence, together with the size of the fragment, that this band is the C-terminal domain of rhodanese. These results suggested that the 4.25 m urea-equilibrated rhodanese loosened the interaction of the N- and C-terminal domains, and the tether region of rhodanese was easily accessible to trypsin digestion. The N-terminal sequence of the 21.2-kDa band corresponded to the N terminus of native rhodanese, suggesting that this species contains the N-terminal domain, as well as part of the C-terminal domain. In addition, the 12-kDa band sequence showed that it contained two fragments that were close in size and comigrated within the resolution of the gel system. One fragment started with Ala-183, and the second fragment started with Tyr-187, both of which are located in the C-terminal domain. These data indicated that the 21.2- and 12-kDa bands might also be directly cleaved from the full-length rhodanese. Overall, 4.25m-equilibrated rhodanese might be susceptible to tryptic digestion at two major locations, the tether region and the 183–187 region in the C-terminal domain. In order to obtain information on the effect of the domains structure of rhodanese and its unfolding, we investigated its structure by using urea to create the partially unfolded enzyme. Because rhodanese consists of two equal-sized domains connected by a linker region that is located on the surface of the molecule, rhodanese has been a very important model for studying structure and refolding, as well as function. Folding intermediates of rhodanese have been investigated to explain aspects of unfolding, stability, and binding of the enzyme to the molecular chaperone (8Horowitz P.M. Butler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2500-2504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Mendoza J.A. Rogers E. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13587-13591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Mendoza J.A. Rogers E. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13044-13049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, little is known about the details of these structures. Therefore, it was very important to obtain the structure information on intermediate conformations involved in folding. Our studies have increased our understanding of intermediate unfolded states of rhodanese. When rhodanese was partially unfolded with 4.25 m urea, hydrophobic regions on rhodanese were exposed. This conformation has been described as “beads on a string” (8Horowitz P.M. Butler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2500-2504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in which rhodanese unfolds to give compact regions separated by less structured regions. The model was proposed based on results in which the urea-unfolded rhodanese was partially digested by a nonspecific protease, subtilisin, to produce many distinct bands (8Horowitz P.M. Butler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2500-2504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, there has been little direct experimental evidence to support the hypothesis that rhodanese was digested according to its domains. The sequence connecting the domains of rhodanese is located on the surface of the molecule. Therefore, it was assumed that it should be easily proteolyzed to release the two domains. However, many methods have failed to demonstrate that the tether region is accessible to the protease digestion (4Luo G.X. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10246-10251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Merrill G.A. Butler M. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15611-15620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Horowitz P.M. Butler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2500-2504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Horowitz P.M.

We investigated the intermediate state of rhodanese by using the time course as well as SDS-PAGE to examine the course of the digestion more carefully. Another point of these experiments is that we utilized a specific protease, trypsin, to digest the partially unfolded enzyme. Previously, experiments were performed using nonspecific subtilisin (8Horowitz P.M. Butler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2500-2504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).2 The peptides from this digestion could not be identified because of their variable N termini. The present studies used the more specific protease, trypsin, which cleaves peptide bonds only at the C terminus of arginine and lysine residues. Rhodanese has 36 trypsin cleavage sites (20 arginine residues and 16 lysine residues). From the N-terminal sequencing, the major digested fragments, the 17- and 15.9-kDa bands represent the N- and C-terminal domains, respectively. The results indicated that rhodanese was unfolded to intermediate states in which the interactions between the two domains were loosened, and the connecting loop was accessible to protease attack. Two other digested fragments, the 21.2- and 12-kDa bands also appeared at 1 min of digestion. The 12-kDa band has an N terminus of Ala-183 or Tyr-187. The sequencing data, as well as the size information, indicated that those bands were also generated from full-length rhodanese. These data suggested that rhodanese might be unfolded to have two major proteolytic accesses: the tether region and the 183–187 region in the C-terminal domain. We have investigated whether the ES form and the E form have different digestion patterns. Tryptic digestion demonstrated that the digestion patterns of both 4.25m urea-unfolded forms were the same over the time course studied. This study is consistent with data from x-ray crystallography showing that ES and E have very limited structural differences, which are mostly confined to the active site (19Ploegman J.H. Drent G. Kalk K.H. Hol W.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 127: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Several models would formally be possible for the structure of rhodanese in 4.25 m urea: 1) rhodanese structure is loosened globally; 2) the tether sequence is released from the rhodanese surface and the rhodanese domains are still associated; or 3) rhodanese domains separate, and the tether becomes accessible as suggested by the beads on a string model. To address this question, rhodanese was digested by trypsin, and the digested products were monitored over time by the method of the SDS-PAGE. As demonstrated in Fig. 4, rhodanese was digested into four major bands at 1 min, which were subsequently digested to smaller peptides. From this result, reaching the intermediate state through global unfolding is not possible because rhodanese would otherwise be degraded by trypsin at any cleavage site to produce variety of small peptides. The existence of intact associated domains with only a loosened tether is not likely, because then the extensive hydrophobic exposure would not be achieved as observed in Fig. 2. In addition, all rhodanese molecules would have been cleaved first only at the tether region. The most consistent model is beads on a string: that is, domain separation. This model fits the observation that treatment with 4.25 m urea resulted in increased hydrophobic exposure, as well as largely maintaining protease resistant domains. The data also suggest that the released domains of rhodanese become more susceptible to trypsin digestion. A possible explanation is that the released domains may change to a less stable conformation. Thus, the N-terminal domains accumulated with time of trypsin digestion, whereas the C-terminal domains accumulated initially, but they began to disappear after 30 min digestion. This observation was true when digestion was performed with subtilisin instead of trypsin.2 In these studies, the 15.9-kDa C-terminal domain was further cleaved by trypsin at Ala-183 and Tyr-187. This is consistent with the C-terminal domain being more fragile than the N-terminal domain. A recent report indicated that the N-terminal signal sequence of rhodanese is a key for stability of the enzyme (4Luo G.X. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10246-10251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Trevino R.J. Tsalkova T. Kramer G. Hardesty B. Chirgwin J.M. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27841-27847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the deletion in the N-terminal signal sequence (Δ1–23) caused inactivation as well as instability of the rhodanese molecule (6Trevino R.J. Tsalkova T. Kramer G. Hardesty B. Chirgwin J.M. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27841-27847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that a site-directed mutant that replaced glutamic acids with Pro-17 has lower stability to perturbation by urea and has higher hydrophobic exposure in the unperturbed condition in comparison to the wild type (4Luo G.X. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10246-10251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From these previous data, the N-terminal signal sequence appeared to contribute to stability of rhodanese. However, the data presented here show little indication that the N-terminal sequence play a significant role in opening the two domains of rhodanese or that the N-terminal sequence was the major proteolytic target of trypsin. As previously shown in proteolysis with immobilized trypsin, the approximate 31-kDa band has been detected among the digested products (7Merrill G.A. Butler M. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15611-15620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the band was a minor species in these studies, so it is unlikely that the removal of the N-terminal region contributes to destabilize the interactions between the two globular domains of rhodanese. Therefore, the N-terminal sequence might be important for domain stability of the rhodanese structure but not be required to loosen the domain structure. Overall, we have demonstrated that the interaction of the rhodanese domains can be loosened, using 4.25 m urea, which leads to an increase in the hydrophobic surface exposure as well as the proteolytic susceptibility in the rhodanese tether region. The results also further support the idea that the intermediate state of rhodanese can be viewed as beads on a string, i.e. a domain-separated structure connected by a proteolytically susceptible sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1594026453,"S3-v-erbB is a retroviral oncogene that encodes a ligand-independent, transforming mutant of the epidermal growth factor receptor. This oncogene has been shown to be sarcomagenicin vivo and to transform fibroblasts in vitro. Our previous studies (McManus, M. J., Lingle, W. L., Salisbury, J. L., and Maihle, N. J. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 94, 11351–11356) showed that expression of S3-v-erbB in primary fibroblasts results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of caldesmon (CaD), an actin- and calmodulin-binding protein. This phosphorylation is transformation-associated, and the phosphorylated form of CaD is associated with a signaling complex consisting of Shc, Grb2, and Sos in transformed fibroblasts. To identify the tyrosine phosphorylation site(s) in the CaD molecule and to further elucidate the functional role of CaD tyrosine phosphorylation in S3-v-ErbB oncogenic signaling, we have generated a series of mutant CaDs in which one or more tyrosine residues have been replaced with phenylalanine. Using a CaD null cell line, DF1 cells (an immortalized chicken embryo fibroblast cell line), and transient transfection assays, we demonstrated that Tyr-27 and Tyr-393 are the major sites of tyrosine phosphorylation on CaD. Interestingly, Tyr-27 is located within the myosin binding domain of CaD, and Tyr-393 is adjacent to one of the major actin binding and actomyosin ATPase inhibitory domains. Our studies also show that the tyrosine phosphorylation of CaD enhances its binding to the Shc·Grb2 complex. Specifically, replacement of Tyr-27, but not of Tyr-165 or Tyr-393, significantly reduces the ability of CaD to interact with the Shc·Grb2 complex. Together, these studies demonstrate that the major sites of tyrosine phosphorylation on CaD are located in the myosin and actin binding domains of CaD and that Tyr-27 is the major tyrosine phosphorylation site through which CaD interacts with the Shc·Grb2 complex.

Together, these studies demonstrate that the major sites of tyrosine phosphorylation on CaD are located in the myosin and actin binding domains of CaD and that Tyr-27 is the major tyrosine phosphorylation site through which CaD interacts with the Shc·Grb2 complex. epidermal growth factor receptor caldesmon cell division cycle 2 chicken embryo fibroblast Src homologous and collagen protein growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 Son of Sevenless polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis avian erythroblastosis viral oncogene Src homology In response to ligand stimulation, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)1 undergoes a series of changes, including homo- and/or heterodimerization, activation of the kinase domain, and autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues in its carboxyl-terminal domain (reviewed in Refs. 1Heldin C.-H.

The activated EGFR in turn phosphorylates a variety of intracellular substrates, and the phosphotyrosine residues on the receptor itself function as docking sites for Src homology 2 (SH2) and phosphotyrosine binding domain-containing proteins such as Shc and Grb2 (6Pelicci G.

Shc, once phosphorylated on tyrosine, binds to both the activated EGFR and to the SH2 domain of Grb2 (6Pelicci G. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni F. Nicoletti I. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F.

Subsequently, Grb2 interacts with the nucleotide exchange factor Sos through its SH3 domain, thereby recruiting the Shc·Grb2·Sos-signaling complex to the plasma membrane, leading to activation of the Ras/Raf signal transduction pathway (Ref. 8Lowenstein E.J. Daly R.J. Batzer A.G. Li W. Margolis B. Lammers R. Ullrich A. Skolnik E.Y. Bar-Sagi D. Schlessinger J.

Landes Co., Austin, Tex1996: 75-94Crossref Google Scholar). This EGF-induced signaling pathway is strictly mitogenic; mere overexpression of the EGFR generally does not result in transformation (10Khazaie K. Dull T.J. Graf T. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A.

Unlike the wild-type EGF receptor, mutant receptor proteins encoded by the retroviral oncogene v-erbB exhibit ligand-independent tyrosine kinase activity, and most of these viral oncogenes cause transformation in a tissue-specific manner (reviewed in Refs. 13Hayman M.J. Enrietto P.J. Cancer Cells. 1991; 3: 302-307PubMed Google Scholar and14Maihle N.J. Kung H.-J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 948: 287-304Google Scholar). For instance, E1-v-ErbB, which lacks the extracellular ligand binding domain, only elicits transformation in erythroblasts (reviewed in Ref. 14Maihle N.J. Kung H.-J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 948: 287-304Google Scholar). S3-v-ErbB, which has deletions in both the extracellular domain and the carboxyl-terminal region, is sarcomagenic but not leukemogenic (reviewed in Ref. 14Maihle N.J. Kung H.-J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 948: 287-304Google Scholar). Tissue-specific transformation by either E1-v-ErbB or S3-v-ErbB is correlated with tyrosine phosphorylation events that are distinct from those induced by the normal interactions that occur between wild-type EGFR and its ligands (15McManus M.J. Connolly D.C. Maihle N.J. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3631-3638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations indicate that the oncogenic signal transduction pathways induced by E1-v-ErbB and S3-v-ErbB may be different from the mitogenic signaling pathways stimulated by ligand binding to the wild-type receptor. This idea has been reinforced by the recent finding that caldesmon (CaD), a regulatory protein that modulates actin-myosin interactions and the reorganization and stability of actin stress fibers, becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine in S3-v-ErbB-transformed cells but not in E1-v-ErbB-expressing cells or in cells stimulated with ligand (16McManus M.J. Lingle W.L. Salisbury J.L. Maihle N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11351-11356Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although both E1-v-ErbB and S3-v-ErbB expression induces the formation of a Shc·Grb2·Sos-signaling complex, the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of CaD only associates with the Shc·Grb2·Sos complex in S3-v-ErbB-transformed cells (16McManus M.J. Lingle W.L. Salisbury J.L. Maihle N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11351-11356Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This distinct pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation events in S3-v-ErbB-transformed fibroblasts may be associated with the molecular basis for transformation by this receptor. However, it remains to be determined whether the tyrosine phosphorylation of CaD is required for its interaction with the Shc·Grb2-signaling complex and what functional role CaD tyrosine phosphorylation may play in S3-v-ErbB-induced oncogenic signaling. CaD is a ubiquitous actin- and calmodulin-binding protein (reviewed in Refs. 17Marston S.B. Redwood C.S. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar and 18Sobue K. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12115-12118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two isoforms, h-CaD and l-CaD, have been identified, which result from alternative splicing of mRNA transcripts arising from a single gene (19Bretscher A. Lynch W. J.

A. 1985; 82: 5025-5029Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). h-CaD is present only in smooth muscle cells (19Bretscher A. Lynch W. J.

A. 1985; 82: 5025-5029Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In contrast,l-CaD is widely distributed in a variety of nonmuscle cells and is one of the major components of actin stress fibers (19Bretscher A. Lynch W. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1656-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 20Sobue K. Tanaka T. Kanda K. Ashino N. Kakiuchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5025-5029Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although it lacks the central helical region that is present inh-CaD, l-CaD shares all of the other structural and functional features of h-CaD, including a rod-like molecular shape, heat stability, ability to bind actin, myosin, tropomyosin, and calmodulin, and inhibition of actomyosin ATPase activity (Refs. 19Bretscher A. Lynch W. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1656-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar and 20Sobue K. Tanaka T. Kanda K. Ashino N. Kakiuchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12115-12118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence that CaD plays a regulatory role in microfilament reorganization during cell division as well as in actin-based cell motility in interphase cells (Refs. 21Warren K.S.

In mitotic cells, the binding of CaD to actin stress fibers is inhibited by the serine phosphorylation of CaD via the cell cycle-dependent kinase p34 cdc2, resulting in stress fiber disassembly (25Yamashiro S. Yamakita Y. Ishikawa R. Matsumura F. Nature. 1990; 344: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 26Yamashiro S. Yamakita Y. Hosoya H. Matsumura F. Nature. 1990; 349: 169-172Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In interphase cells, overexpression of a CaD carboxyl-terminal fragment, which contains the actin, calmodulin, and tropomyosin binding domains of CaD, increases the number of tropomyosin-associated actin filaments and also causes an increase in cytochalasin B resistance due to the increased stability of microfilaments (21Warren K.S. Lin J.L.-C. Wamboldt D.D. Lin J.J.-C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition, in recent studies by Lamb et al. (27Lamb N.J. Fernandez A. Mezgueldi M. Labbe J.P. Kassab R. Fattoum A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 69: 36-44PubMed Google Scholar), inhibition of CaD via microinjection of a CaD-specific antibody can lead to disruption of actin stress fibers. In this study, we have concentrated on structurally mapping the sites of CaD tyrosine phosphorylation in transformed fibroblasts and on identifying the functionally relevant site(s) of tyrosine phosphorylation in the CaD molecule. Using a series of CaDs bearing point mutations, a CaD null cell line (DF1), and transient transfection assays, we confirm previous results demonstrating that CaD is tyrosine-phosphorylated only in transformed cells, and we identify tyrosine 27 and tyrosine 393 as the major sites of CaD tyrosine phosphorylation. Furthermore, our studies demonstrate that the association of CaD with the S3-v-ErbB-induced Shc·Grb2 signaling complex is dependent on the tyrosine phosphorylation of CaD. Anti-human CaD monoclonal antibody and anti-chicken gizzard CaD monoclonal antibody were from Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA) and Sigma, respectively. Both anti-human Shc and anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma or Fisher. A recombinant pBluescript CaD plasmid containing the entire coding sequence of chicken gizzard nonmuscle CaD (from Joseph Bryan, Baylor College of Medicine) was used as the template for our site-directed mutagenesis reactions. The oligonucleotides used to create the tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutations were as follows: 5′-GCAGAGAGACTGTCCTTCCAGAGGAATGATGAT-3′ for changing Tyr-27 to Phe; 5′-ACAGTTACGAAATCGTTCCAAAGGAACAATTGG-3′ for changing Tyr-165 to Phe; 5′-AGTAGACTTGAGCAATTTACTAGCGCTGTTGTG-3′ for changing Tyr-393 to Phe. The underlined sequences indicate the mutated regions. The mutant forms of CaD, in which one or more tyrosine residues were replaced with phenylalanine, were generated using a polymerase chain reaction-based site-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The structure of all mutant CaDs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The wild-type CaD cDNA and each of the CaD mutant constructs were introduced into the BamHI and ApaI sites of the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Primary cultures of chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) were prepared and cultured as described (15McManus M.J. Connolly D.C. Maihle N.J. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3631-3638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16McManus M.J. Lingle W.L. Salisbury J.L. Maihle N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11351-11356Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). DF1, an immortalized cell line, was derived from CEFs (28Himly M. Foster D.N. Bottoli I. Iacovoni J.S. Vogt P.K. Virology. 1998; 248: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 29Schaefer-Klein J. Givol I. Barsov E.V. Whitcomb J.M. VanBrocklin M. Foster D.N. Federspiel M.J. Hughest S.H. Virology. 1998; 248: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g of glucose/liter and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), and 0.1% amphotericin B (Fungizone). A cDNA encoding S3-v-ErbB was inserted into the recombinant avian leukosis (RCAN) vector (30Hughes S.H. Greenhouse J.J. Petropoulos C.J. Sutrave P. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3004-3012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the avian recombinant retrovirus was produced by transfecting the recombinant RCAN vector into CEF cells as described (31Connolly D.C. Toutenhoofd S.L. Maihle N.J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6804-6810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DF1 (DF1S3) and CEF (CEFS3) cells expressing S3-v-ErbB were obtained by infection of either DF1 or CEFs with the recombinant S3-v-erbB RCAN virus. DF1 or DF1S3 were grown on 10-cm culture dishes to 50–80% confluence, and transient transfections with either pcDNA3 or recombinant pcDNA3 containing cDNA for wild-type CaD or one of the mutant CaDs were carried out using the LipofectAMINE transfection method (Life Technologies, Inc.). Eight to 10 μg of plasmid DNA were used for each transfection. Thirty-six h post-transfection, cells were lysed and assayed as described below. DF1, DF1S3, or CEFS3 cells were grown to 70–90% confluence, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and then scraped into a phosphate-buffered saline washing buffer containing 4 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate (Sigma) and 100 μm vanadate (15McManus M.J. Connolly D.C. Maihle N.J. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3631-3638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16McManus M.J. Lingle W.L. Salisbury J.L. Maihle N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11351-11356Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). After centrifugation (×12,000 g ), cell pellets were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in a lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium PPi, 0.5% deoxycholate, 100 mm vanadate, 4 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. The supernatant fractions were collected after centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, and the protein concentrations of the lysates were determined by the method of Lowry (Bio-Rad protein assay; Bio-Rad). Aliquots of extracts containing equal amounts of protein were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose in a Hoefer Transphor apparatus (Hoefer Scientific Instruments) at 0.5–1 A for 3–6 h at 4 °C. The nitrocellulose was blocked with a blocking buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5% bovine serum albumin) for 1–2 h at 4 °C and then incubated with primary antibodies in the blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. After washing three times in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Tween 20, the nitrocellulose was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in the blocking buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing, the nitrocellulose was analyzed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposure to x-ray film. For immunoprecipitation assays, aliquots of 500 μg of protein were incubated in immunoprecipitation buffer A (190 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 6 mm EDTA, 2.5% Triton X-100) with the appropriate primary antibody overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with ImmunoPure protein A/G beads (50 μl/sample) (Pierce) for 1 h at 4 °C. The protein A/G beads were washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer B (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100) and once with Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl), followed by analysis by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. DF1S3 cells grown to 70% confluency on 10-cm dishes were transiently transfected with wild-type CaD or one of the mutant CaDs. Thirty-six h post-transfection, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and once with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's phosphate-free media (Specialty Media, Lavellette, NJ), and were cultured in phosphate-free medium in the presence of 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; final concentration, 1.7 mCi/ml) for 6 h followed by cell lysis as described above. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with an anti-CaD antibody, and immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to Immunobilon-P (Millipore). The 80-kDa 32P-labeled CaD protein band was identified using x-ray film and was excised from Immunobilon-P for further analysis. The band containing 32P-labeled CaD was suspended in 6m HCl, and acid hydrolysis was performed at 110 °C for 60 min. Thin-layer electrophoresis was carried out at pH 1.9 (2.2% formic acid, 7.8% acetic acid) for 30 min at 1 kV in one dimension and at pH 3.5 (5% acetic acid, 0.5% pyridine) for 25 min at 1.4 kV in the second dimension according to published methods (32Cooper J.A. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1981; 1: 165-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). We demonstrated previously that S3-v-ErbB-induced fibroblast transformation is closely correlated with the tyrosine phosphorylation of CaD, a known regulator of actin stress fiber stability (16McManus M.J. Lingle W.L. Salisbury J.L. Maihle N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11351-11356Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To identify the major tyrosine phosphorylation site(s) in the CaD molecule, we have taken advantage of the avian fibroblast cell line, DF1, a stable, nontransformed cell line that exhibits anchorage-dependent growth and normal fibroblastic morphology (28Himly M. Foster D.N. Bottoli I. Iacovoni J.S. Vogt P.K. Virology. 1998; 248: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 29Schaefer-Klein J. Givol I. Barsov E.V. Whitcomb J.M. VanBrocklin M. Foster D.N. Federspiel M.J. Hughest S.H. Virology. 1998; 248: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). DF1 cells, although derived from CEFs, have a much longer life span in culture than CEFs (28Himly M. Foster D.N. Bottoli I. Iacovoni J.S. Vogt P.K. Virology. 1998; 248: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 29Schaefer-Klein J. Givol I. Barsov E.V. Whitcomb J.M. VanBrocklin M. Foster D.N. Federspiel M.J. Hughest S.H. Virology. 1998; 248: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and contain no detectable CaD (see Fig. 1 B). After infecting DF1 cells with the recombinant helper-independent retroviral vector RCAN containing S3-v-erbB cDNA, S3-v-ErbB was expressed at high levels, similar to the levels seen in S3-v-erbB-infected CEFs (Fig. 1 A). We then tested whether transient transfection could be used to overexpress CaD in S3-v-erbB-infected DF1 cells. As shown in Fig.1 B, transient transfection of CaD in DF1 cells resulted in an exceptionally high level of CaD expression (5–10-fold greater than the level detected in CEF cells, data not shown). Because of the lack of endogenous CaD in DF1, we chose DF1 cells for our analysis of the tyrosine phosphorylation sites in the CaD molecule. There are three potential tyrosine phosphoacceptor sites in avianl-CaD. As illustrated in Fig.2, we constructed a series of CaD mutants in which one or more of the three tyrosine residues were replaced with phenylalanine. These mutant forms of CaD included three with single replacements (CaDY27F, CaDY165F, and CaDY393F), three with double replacements (CaDY27/165F, CaDY165/393F, and CaDY27/393F), and one in which all three tyrosines were replaced (CaDY27/165/393F). The amino-terminal tyrosine of CaD (Tyr-27) is located just within the major myosin-binding site (33Wang Z. Jiang H. Yang Z.Q. Chacko S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11899-11904Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and the carboxyl-terminal tyrosine (Tyr-393) is located close to one of the actin binding domains (34Redwood C.S. Marston S.B. J.

Both Tyr-27 and Tyr-165 lie within a YQXNX sequence context, similar to the consensus YQNX sequence recognized by the SH2 domain of Grb2 (40Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier P. Pawson T. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T. Ren R. Baltimore D. Ratnofsky S. Feldman R.A. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). In contrast, Tyr-393 lies within a sequence that does not conform to any known phosphotyrosine binding motif. As illustrated in Fig. 3 A, tyrosine phosphorylation of CaD was detectable only in DF1S3 cells transfected with the recombinant CaD vector (Fig. 3 A,DF1S3+ CaD). In contrast, the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of CaD was not detectable in any of the control samples (Fig.3 A, DF1, DF1S3, orDF1+ CaD). Immunoblot analysis of the same samples with anti-CaD (Fig. 3, panel B) showed that equivalent amounts of CaD were present in the immunoprecipitates from these transfectants (Fig. 3 B). These data strongly suggest that in DF1 cells, CaD tyrosine phosphorylation is dependent on S3-v-ErbB expression. We next sought to determine the major sites of tyrosine phosphorylation on CaD by performing the experiments described above using the mutant forms of CaD with substituted tyrosines. Fig. 3, A andC, show that the mutation of either Tyr-27 (DF1S3+CaDY27F) or Tyr-393 (DF1S3+CaDY393F) significantly decreased the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of CaD, whereas the mutation of Tyr-165 (DF1S3+CaDY165F) resulted in only a slight reduction in the tyrosine phosphorylation of CaD (Fig.3 C). As expected, the triple substitution mutant was not tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig. 3 A,DF1S3+ CaDY27/165/393F). These immunoblot results suggest that the tyrosine residues Tyr-27 and Tyr-393 of CaD are the major sites of tyrosine phosphorylation in vivo. To verify these results, DF1 cells transfected with wild-type CaD and DF1S3 cells transfected with wild-type CaD or the series of CaD double mutants in which only one CaD tyrosine residue was retained were radiolabeled with 32Pi and immunoprecipitated with anti-CaD antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The resulting radiolabeled CaD proteins were subjected to acid hydrolysis, and the products were analyzed by two-dimensional phosphoamino acid mapping. Fig.4 A shows the phosphorylation pattern of CaD in DF1 cells expressing recombinant wild-type CaD. Two major 32P-labeled spots comigrated with the phosphoserine and phosphothreonine standards, but no radioactivity comigrated with the marker for phosphotyrosine (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, in DF1S3 cells expressing recombinant wild-type CaD, three radiolabeled spots were detectable, which comigrated with the phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine standards (Fig. 4 B). This observation was consistent with our earlier finding that CaD is only tyrosine-phosphorylated in DF1 cells expressing S3-v-ErbB (as in CEFS3 (16McManus M.J. Lingle W.L. Salisbury J.L. Maihle N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11351-11356Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar)). In addition, both CaDY27/165F (Fig. 4 C) and CaDY165/393F (Fig. 4 E) were tyrosine-phosphorylated in DF1S3 cells; however, the level of tyrosine phosphorylation for both of these CaD mutants was relatively low compared with that of wild-type CaD (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, the CaDY27/393F mutant was not tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig. 4 D). As predicted, no detectable tyrosine phosphorylation was present on the CaD triple mutant (Fig. 4 F), even though this form was still heavily serine/threonine-phosphorylated. The relative level of tyrosine phosphorylation of wild-type CaD and each of the mutant CaDs was determined by calculating the ratio of phosphotyrosine to phosphoserine (pY/pS Ratio, Fig. 5). Substitution of either Tyr-27 or Tyr-393, but not Tyr-165, significantly reduced the Tyr(P)/Ser(P) ratio, and the Tyr(P)/Ser(P) ratio for CaDY165/393F was much lower than that observed for CaDY27/165F (Fig. 5), suggesting that the stoichiometry of Tyr-393 phosphorylation is greater than that of Tyr-27. Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that Tyr-27 and Tyr-393, but not Tyr-165, are the major sites of tyrosine phosphorylation in t"

To examine the mechanism of STE-mediated stop-transfer, a series of fusion proteins were constructed containing variants of a putative STE from murine IgM fused to an otherwise translocated hydrophobic sequence. Unexpectedly, the fraction of molecules adopting transmembrane topology was insensitive to many amino acid substitutions within the STE sequence but varied directly with the number of negative charges. Furthermore, when present at the amino terminus of a reporter, mutants were observed that adopted type I (amino terminus lumenal) and type II (amino terminus cytoplasmic) transmembrane topologies, demonstrating that the STE sequence can be located at either side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Our results suggest that recognition of a broad structural feature formed primarily by negatively charged residues within the STE halts translocation and triggers membrane integration, even when the negative charges end up on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Since functional STE sequences photocross-link to two membrane proteins not previously identified at the translocon, these unique proteins are presumably involved in recognizing STE sequences and/or facilitating STE function.

Moreover, the precise sequence and/or length of a hydrophobic transmembrane sequence is a critical factor in regulating transmembrane topology (1Wahlberg J.M. Spiess M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Yet, accumulating evidence also suggests a role for charged residues, primarily in determining the orientation of hydrophobic transmembrane segments in membranes (2Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Cell. 1990; 62: 1135-1141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 3Spiess M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In general, the more positively charged end of the transmembrane sequence is located on the cytoplasmic side of either the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 or bacterial plasma membrane (4von Heijne G. Gavel Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 5Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5786-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, positively charged residues have been shown to play an active role in post-translational (mostly Sec-independent) integration into membranes (6Dalbey R.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 253-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 7Johansson M. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 239: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it appears that positive charges regulate topology by blocking protein translocation (7Johansson M. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 239: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In yeast, it appears that both negatively and positively charged residues can contribute to the overall charge distribution to govern orientation (8Harley C.A. Tipper D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24625-24633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Recently, other non-hydrophobic effectors of membrane topology have been reported, including both negatively charged residues in E. coli (9Kiefer D. Hu X. Dalbey R. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2197-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and the folded state of the amino terminus (3Spiess M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, cell-free assay systems have revealed numerous details about the translocation process and also provided indications of considerable regulatory complexity (10Hegde R.S. Lingappa V.R. Cell. 1997; 91: 575-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In addition to sequences that regulate topology, cell-free systems have been used to identify sequences that regulate translocation at the ER. A block in translocation has been described for plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 that alters the interaction of the nascent polypeptide with the signal recognition particle and with the translocation machinery in the ER membrane. The translocation block results in both secreted and cytoplasmic forms of the protein (11Belin D. Bost S. Vassalli J.D. Strub K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that P-glycoprotein, a membrane protein predicted to span the membrane 12 times, adopts at least two different membrane topologies (12Skach W.R. Lingappa V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23552-23561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Zhang J.T. Duthie M. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15101-15110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell-free assays were also used to demonstrate that the protein ductin adopts two different topologies at the ER membrane (14Dunlop J. Jones P.C. Finbow M.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3609-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It was later determined that both forms are physiologically relevant. One form of ductin is a subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase, and the other is found in gap junctions. Dual topology has also been demonstrated for the L protein of hepatitis B virus. In this case the molecule appears to be initially integrated into the ER membrane in a single orientation and then a subset of the polypeptides are post-translationally translocated across the ER membrane to generate the alternate orientation (15Swameye I. Schaller H. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9434-9441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to these sequences, which appear to determine the final orientation of a transmembrane segment in the membrane, there is also evidence for sequence-specific regulation of polypeptide integration into the ER membrane (10Hegde R.S. Lingappa V.R. Cell. 1997; 91: 575-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Integration into membranes may be regulated for some sequences that are not sufficiently hydrophobic to simply partition into the lipid bilayer. For example, correct membrane assembly of some integral membrane proteins involves the integration of multiple transmembrane segments that individually are unable to integrate into the lipid bilayer (10Hegde R.S. Lingappa V.R. Cell. 1997; 91: 575-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Co- and post-translational translocation mechanisms involving the first two transmembrane sequences have been implicated in correct assembly of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (16Lu Y. Xiong X. Helm A. Kimani K. Bragin A. Skach W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 568-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Furthermore, an unusual transmembrane sequence that appears to be regulated for integration into the ER membrane was identified as part of transmembrane sequence 7 from P-glycoprotein (17Moss K. Helm A. Lu Y. Bragin A. Skach W.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2681-2697Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Finally, an element termed a stop-transfer effector (STE) sequence has been identified that mediates membrane integration of an otherwise secreted hydrophobic domain (18Andrews D.W. Johnson A.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 365-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The two known STE sequences were identified in the transmembrane form of murine IgM (19Andrews D.W. Young J.C. Mirels L.F. Czarnota G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7761-7769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in the prion-related protein, PrP (20Lopez C.D. Yost C.S. Prusiner S.B. Myers R.M. Lingappa V.R. Science. 1990; 248: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 21Yost C.S. Lopez C.D. Prusiner S.B. Myers R.M. Lingappa V.R. Nature. 1990; 343: 669-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Many immunoglobulins are synthesized in both secreted and transmembrane forms. Over most of the length of the molecules, the two forms are identical, but the transmembrane forms contain an additional sequence at the carboxyl terminus of the polypeptide. This sequence encodes a hydrophilic sequence of approximately 20 amino acids, followed by the hydrophobic transmembrane domain of the protein. Differential splicing of the primary transcript that adds another exon to the mRNA accounts for the change in protein sequence (22Cheng H.L. Blattner F.R. Fitzmaurice L. Mushinski J.F. Tucker P.W. Nature. 1982; 296: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 23Rogers J. Choi E. Souza L. Carter C. Word C. Kuehl M. Eisenberg D. Wall R. Cell. 1981; 26: 19-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In vitro, a sequence of amino acids including the hydrophilic sequence amino-terminal of the murine IgM transmembrane sequence was demonstrated to have STE activity when positioned at either the amino terminus or in the middle of a secreted protein (19Andrews D.W. Young J.C. Mirels L.F. Czarnota G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7761-7769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of STE-mediated membrane integration is poorly characterized, recent data suggest that it may be fundamentally different than membrane integration mediated by hydrophobicity alone. For example, unlike conventional topology-determining sequences, the function of the PrP STE sequence depends on both the composition of the cell-free translation extract (20Lopez C.D. Yost C.S. Prusiner S.B. Myers R.M. Lingappa V.R. Science. 1990; 248: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and involves a nascent polypeptide-encoded pause in translocation (24Nakahara D.H. Lingappa V.R. Chuck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7617-7622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, recent data demonstrate that when inappropriate membrane integration by the PrP STE is provoked in transgenic animals, neural degeneration results that is very similar to that seen in Gerstmann-Straussler Scheinker syndrome, a correlation that suggests that STE regulation is important in human disease (25Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. DeFea K.A. Tremblay P. Torchia M. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Science. 1998; 279: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the specific properties of STE sequences that trigger integration into membranes because the two known STE sequences show no sequence similarity. Thus, important residues in these STE sequences must be identified experimentally. Here we have used a mutagenesis strategy along with photocross-linking to decipher the signal within the IgM STE that leads to membrane integration. Membrane integration is shown to depend on the unusually large number of negatively charged residues within the STE. Surprisingly, the precise position of the charges is unimportant, and the contribution of each of the negatively charged residues to integration of the polypeptide into the membrane is additive. It appears that STE recognition occurs within the translocon, since functional and non-functional STE sequences both photocross-link the translocon-associated protein TRAM. More importantly, functional STE sequences photocross-link to two proteins, not previously identified as translocon components that may recognize STE elements and effect their function. Plasmids were constructed by introducing restriction sites into the wild-type sequence by site-directed mutagenesis, and then all further substitutions were made by inserting oligonucleotides into these sites within the plasmids. The positions of the relevant restriction sites relative to the coding sequence is indicated below the sequence in Fig. 1 A. All of the plasmids were sequenced using standard techniques. All plasmids except C1 were inserted following the SP6 RNA polymerase promoter and 5′-untranslated leader in pSPUTK. In C1, the plasmid is identical to pSPUTK except that an Ala at the −3 position of the UTK leader is substituted with a Cys. The coding sequences of the different plasmids differ only in the regions indicated as the hydrophobic or the STE region in Fig. 1. Unless specified otherwise the hydrophobic region was derived from the hydrophobic core of the preprolactin signal sequence by deleting the last seven amino acids and replacing an amino-terminal arginine with a cysteine (19Andrews D.W. Young J.C. Mirels L.F. Czarnota G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7761-7769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In WT, the hydrophobic region contains the hydrophobic core sequence from IgM (19Andrews D.W. Young J.C. Mirels L.F. Czarnota G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7761-7769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An additional set of plasmids was generated by replacing the hydrophobic region with the regulated portion of transmembrane sequence 7 from human P-glycoprotein (17Moss K. Helm A. Lu Y. Bragin A. Skach W.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2681-2697Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The signal cleavage region is common to all of the constructs and is arbitrarily defined as the 9 amino acids after the hydrophobic region. This sequence contains a cryptic signal peptide cleavage site. Thus the signal cleavage region is the first 9 amino acids of the Pt domain (amino acids 58–199 of prolactin) that was used as a reporter. The control plasmids encode related non-hydrophobic residues and positive charges (C1 and C2) or a single Met (C3) in place of the STE region in the other constructs. Five plasmids were constructed in which the STE and hydrophobic region are positioned internally in the polypeptide between two reporter domains. These constructs included STEs A2, A7, A16, C1, and C2. Another three plasmids were constructed in which the hydrophobic region was replaced by a segment (NGGLQPAFAIIFSKTTGVFTRIDDPETKRQ) from transmembrane sequence 7 from P-glycoprotein (17Moss K. Helm A. Lu Y. Bragin A. Skach W.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2681-2697Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In these plasmids, the first reporter sequence (globin amino acids 1–107) is preceded with a secretory signal peptide (from preprolactin), and thus the entire polypeptide is translocated into the interior of the microsome unless the STE stops translocation. The construction of these plasmids was via cassette mutagenesis using the restriction sites in Fig. 1 but starting with a plasmid encoding the globin and Pt domains reported previously (19Andrews D.W. Young J.C. Mirels L.F. Czarnota G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7761-7769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Construction and characterization of the plasmid encoding the WT STE and hydrophobic transmembrane region of murine membrane IgM fused to amino acids 58–199 of bovine preprolactin were reported previously (19Andrews D.W. Young J.C. Mirels L.F. Czarnota G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7761-7769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence MVTER overlined in Fig. 1 indicates extra amino acids added to the WT STE during cloning. Full construction details for each plasmid are available from the authors. Plasmids were transcribed in vitro using SP6 polymerase, and then polypeptides were synthesized from unpurified transcription products using either a rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation system or a wheat germ extract supplemented with canine pancreatic microsomes. Prior to proteolysis, the canine pancreatic microsomes were separated from untargeted molecules in the reticulocyte lysate translation reaction by gel filtration chromatography on Sepharose CL-2B resin. The excluded fractions containing microsomes and microsome-associated proteins (150 μl) were pooled, divided into 3 aliquots of 45 μl, and proteinase K was added to two of the samples at 0.03 mg/ml for 15 min at 0 °C. Proteolysis was terminated by adding trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 16% (w/v). Precipitated proteins were washed with ethanol/ether (1:1, v/v), and resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. After electrophoresis, radioactivity was recorded from the dried polyacrylamide gel using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). To create a reagent that would modify cysteine residues in the fusion protein, but would not cross the ER membrane, we reactedN-(γ-maleimidobutyryloxy) succinimide ester (GMBS, Pierce) with spermine to synthesize N-(γ-maleimidobutyryloxy) spermine amide (GMBSA). The resulting compound contains a reactive maleimide attached to one of the four amino groups of spermine. For this reaction, spermine was dissolved in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile/water to a final concentration of 180 mm. 150 μl of 0.5m triethylamine (pH 7.5) was added to 400 μl of the spermine solution, and the resulting solution was covered with parafilm to prevent evaporation. GMBS was dissolved in 100% acetonitrile to a final concentration of 180 mm, and 200 μl was added to the spermine solution in 20-μl aliquots at 1-min intervals through a small hole in the parafilm cover. The reaction was allowed to proceed for an additional 40 min at room temperature and then the reaction mixture containing GMBSA was reduced to approximately 200 μl in a speedvac. For labeling membrane proteins from translation reactions, microsomes were isolated from a 10-μl translation reaction using a Sepharose CL-2B gel exclusion column equilibrated in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2. Protease inhibitors were added to the excluded volume (90 μl) to final concentrations of 1 μg/ml chymostatin, antipain, leupeptin, pepstatin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. The excluded fraction containing the membranes was divided into two equal fractions, adjusted to 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and one was labeled by adding 4.5 μl of GMBSA and incubating at 24 °C for 1 h. The reactions were quenched by adding dithiothreitol to 20 mm and incubating for 5 min at 24 °C. The membranes were then pelleted from the reactions by centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C through a 100 μl 0.5 m sucrose cushion in a 200-μl Airfuge tube. To assess the GMBSA reactivity (topology) of integrated proteins, the reactions were processed as above except that they were adjusted to 1 m urea, 0.2 m sodium carbonate (pH 11.5) before centrifugation. Membrane pellets were resuspended directly in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and separated on a 15-cm 16% Laemmli polyacrylamide gel. Photoreactive probes were incorporated into nascent polypeptides by addingN ε-(5-azido-2-nitrobenzoyl)-Lys-tRNA toin vitro translations containing wheat germ extract, truncated mRNA, the signal recognition particle, and microsomes, and samples were then photolyzed and analyzed as described previously (26Do H. Falcone D. Lin J. Andrews D.W. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1996; 85: 369-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 27Liao S. Lin J. Do H. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The additional exon expressed in the transmembrane form of murine IgM includes both the hydrophobic transmembrane sequence and a 21-residue putative STE sequence (19Andrews D.W. Young J.C. Mirels L.F. Czarnota G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7761-7769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar hydrophilic sequences, containing 5–7 negatively charged residues, are found directly amino-terminal of the transmembrane sequence of many immunoglobulins from species as diverse as human and teleost fish. However, both the positions and the relative proportion of glutamic and aspartic acid residues vary. In mouse, the transmembrane form of IgM contains one aspartic and seven glutamic residues, whereas immunoglobulin 2a (A15) contains five aspartic and two glutamic acid residues (Fig. 1). There is no precedent for negatively charged amino acids controlling polypeptide integration into membranes (28Izard J.W. Rusch S.L. Kendall D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21579-21582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, our preliminary deletion analysis of the IgM STE suggested that the Glu residues in the sequence might contribute to STE function (data not shown). Therefore, plasmids encoding a series of fusion proteins were constructed to determine if the negatively charged residues within the IgM STE sequence can contribute to polypeptide integration into ER membranes (Fig. 1). Each fusion protein contains the topogenic element being tested for STE activity and one or more protein domains used as reporter sequences. Regulation of polypeptide integration into membranes and the topologies of the fusion proteins containing each of the various STE sequences were assayed by proteolysis, carbonate extraction, and chemical labeling, after synthesis in reticulocyte lysate or wheat germ extract containing canine pancreatic microsomes. Finally, photocross-linking was used to compare the environments occupied by functional and non-functional STE sequences at the ER membrane. The hydrophobic region used as a potential transmembrane domain was derived from the preprolactin signal sequence because it is unlikely that a hydrophobic sequence from a cleaved secretory signal sequence would contain information other than hydrophobicity that specifies membrane topology or integration. To generate the hydrophobic region from the preprolactin signal sequence, the last seven amino acids of the sequence were deleted (including the signal cleavage site), and an amino-terminal Arg was replaced with Cys. Deletion of the signal cleavage site greatly reduced signal peptide cleavage when the sequence is positioned internally within a secreted protein (less than 5% of molecules are cleaved, data not shown). Although all of the polypeptides contained the same hydrophobic region, the overall length of the hydrophobic portion of the potential transmembrane segment is also determined by the distribution of charged residues in the STE and the uncharged residues in the reporter that immediately precedes the putative STE sequence. Substitution of the negative charges within the STE with uncharged residues can also change the length of the potential transmembrane segment (Fig. 1). To examine assembly of a conventional type I transmembrane protein, chimeric proteins were constructed containing a secretory signal sequence followed by a reporter sequence derived from globin (Gt, amino acids 1–107 of chimpanzee globin) and another reporter sequence from preprolactin (Pt, amino acids 58–199 of bovine preprolactin). The sequences used as reporters have been shown previously to contain no cryptic topogenic elements (29Rothman R.E. Andrews D.W. Calayag M.C. Lingappa V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10470-10480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test the stop-transfer activity of the various STE sequences and hydrophobic region combinations, they were positioned between the Gt and Pt reporter sequences (Fig.2). As expected, the number of molecules that adopted a transmembrane topology depended on the length of the uncharged region of the potential transmembrane sequence. When this region included 23 amino acids (e.g. STE A2), approximately 85% of the molecules were transmembrane irrespective of whether or not a functional STE sequence was included in the molecule (Fig. 2). When other non-functional STE sequences were added to shorter potential transmembrane sequences of 15 (C1) or 17 (C2) residues, approximately 15 and 40% of the molecules were transmembrane, respectively (Fig. 2). In contrast, addition of an STE sequence containing 4 Glu residues to the amino terminus of the same potential transmembrane regions (A16 and A7) increased the transmembrane molecules to approximately 40 and 70%, respectively (Fig. 2 A). Thus, for potential transmembrane sequences of limited hydrophobicity, STE sequences with as few as 4 Glu residues significantly increased the number of molecules that adopted a transmembrane topology. The hydrophobic region used in these molecules was derived from the preprolactin signal sequence but was extensively modified and therefore served only as a hydrophobic sequence that does not on its own remain transmembrane. Although this sequence is not derived from an authentic transmembrane domain, when the uncharged region of the sequence is extended to 23 amino acids, it becomes transmembrane independent of the STE sequence (Fig. 2 A), as expected from previous observations (1Wahlberg J.M. Spiess M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To determine whether or not the STE would stop translocation of an authentic transmembrane domain, it was necessary to fuse the STE sequence to a transmembrane sequence that is not sufficiently hydrophobic to mediate STE-independent membrane integration. The few sequences that have been identified that are marginally hydrophobic yet known to be transmembrane are generally found in multispanning membrane proteins. Of these, transmembrane domain 7 from human P-glycoprotein has been shown to stop poorly when expressed in reporter constructs. Therefore, we examined the effect of the STE sequences on the topology of fusion proteins containing a region of transmembrane domain 7 that was previously shown to become transmembrane only when flanked by hydrophobic transmembrane sequences (17Moss K. Helm A. Lu Y. Bragin A. Skach W.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2681-2697Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, the coding regions of these plasmids are very similar to those used in Fig. 2 Aexcept that the hydrophobic region was replaced with the sequence NGGLQPAFAIIFSKTTGVFTRIDDPETKRQ. The STE sequences differ from A3, A7, and A13 (Fig. 1) only in the last three amino acids (NLW), which were replaced with a single residue (Val) in the new constructs. The results of control experiments indicated that in the absence of an STE sequence the fusion protein was translocated across the ER membrane (data not shown). Addition of the STE sequence with 6 negative charges clearly increased the number of molecules adopting a transmembrane topology (Fig. 2 C). Whereas the STE with only 2 negative charges had a barely detectable effect on topology, the STE with 4 negative charges resulted in an intermediate number of transmembrane molecules. Thus, we conclude that the IgM STE can stop translocation of a regulated transmembrane domain. Detailed examination of the residues required for STE activity was not possible using these constructs because substitution of charged residues for uncharged residues eventually converts the mechanism of integration from one dependent on the STE to one entirely due to hydrophobicity. It was not possible to avoid this complication by substitution of the negatively charged amino acids with sequences containing positively charged residues because the positively charged residues abolished STE function (data not shown). When the hydrophobic region was positioned at the amino terminus of a reporter protein, it was cleaved by signal peptidase and removed from the reporter protein if it failed to be recognized as a bona fide transmembrane domain. Cleavage occurred even when the hydrophobicity was increased by the various charged residue substitutions. For this reason we examined the function of the hydrophobic region alone and fused behind the various STE sequences when positioned at the amino terminus of the Pt reporter domain. When the hydrophobic region was positioned at the amino terminus of a reporter domain, it functioned primarily as a secretory signal sequence, and approximately 80% of the polypeptides were cleaved by signal peptidase. The remaining molecules were not cleaved by signal peptidase, presumably because the authentic signal cleavage site was deleted, and cleavage at the cryptic site is less efficient. Since relatively long uncharged sequences may still function as cleaved secretory signal sequences instead of integrated signal-anchor sequences (28Izard J.W. Rusch S.L. Kendall D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21579-21582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), it was possible to substitute the charged residues in the STE with uncharged amino acids and assay STE activity by the extent of conversion of the s"
