https://openalex.org/W2081172746,"The geographical distribution of the change in soil wetness in response to an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide was investigated by using a mathematical model of climate. Responding to the increase in carbon dioxide, soil moisture in the model would be reduced in summer over extensive regions of the middle and high latitudes, such as the North American Great Plains, western Europe, northern Canada, and Siberia. These results were obtained from the model with predicted cloud cover and are qualitatively similar to the results from several numerical experiments conducted earlier with prescribed cloud cover."
https://openalex.org/W1981910844,"A long-term climatic change 4.0 × 105 to 3.0 × 105 years ago is recorded in deep-sea sediments of the Angola and Canary basins in the eastern Atlantic Ocean. In the Angola Basin (Southern Hemisphere) the climatic signal shows a transition to more humid (""interglacial"") conditions in equatorial Africa, and in the Canary Basin (Northern Hemisphere) to more ""glacial"" oceanic conditions. This trend is confirmed by comparison with all well-documented marine and continental records from various latitudes available; in the Northern Hemisphere, in the Atlantic north of 20°N, climate merged into more ""glacial"" conditions and in equatorial regions and in the Southern Hemisphere to more ""interglacial"" conditions. The data point to a more northern position of early Brunhes oceanic fronts and to an intensified atmosphere and ocean surface circulation in the Southern Hemisphere during that time, probably accompanied by a more zonal circulation in the Northern Hemisphere. The mid-Brunhes climatic change may have been forced by the orbital eccentricity cycle of 4.13 × 105 years."
https://openalex.org/W1997431050,"Blood flow rates may be determined by nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation time measurements. A set of experiments carried out on the flow of blood in mice tails has demonstrated the feasibility of the scheme. Two simple measurement methods are described, and the pertinent equations are given. In addition, some procedures for using nuclear magnetic resonance and electron paramagnetic resonance for tracing the flow of specific materials in the body are outlined."
https://openalex.org/W2008970847,"Dinosaur extinction in Montana, Alberta, and Wyoming was a gradual process that began 7 million years before the end of the Cretaceous and accelerated rapidly in the final 0.3 million years of the Cretaceous, during the interval of apparent competition from rapidly evolving immigrating ungulates. This interval involves rapid reduction in both diversity and population density of dinosaurs. The last dinosaurs known are from a channel that contains teeth of Mantuan mammals, seven species of dinosaurs, and Paleocene pollen. The top of this channel is 1.3 meters above the likely position of the iridium anomaly, the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary."
https://openalex.org/W2009755433,"Ferromanganese oxides in the open oceans are more enriched in cobalt than any other widely distributed sediments or rocks. Concentrations of cobalt exceed 1 percent in ferromanganese crusts on seamounts, ocean ridges, and other raised areas of the ocean. The cobaltrich crusts may be the slowest growing of any earth material, accumulating one molecular layer every 1 to 3 months. Attention has been drawn to crusts as potential resources because they contain cobalt, manganese, and platinum, three of the four priority strategic metals for the United States. Moreover, unlike abyssal nodules, whose recovery is complicated by their dominant location in international waters, some of the most cobalt-rich crusts occur within the exclusive economic zone of the United States and other nations. Environmental impact statements for crust exploitation are under current development by the Department of the Interior."
https://openalex.org/W2012524559,"Dramatic advances in our understanding of the motion of individual atoms and molecules at single-crystal surfaces have been made within the past 5 years. Recent experimental and theoretical studies of the interaction of nitric oxide with metal surfaces illustrate the depth of understanding now obtainable. General principles, applicable to a broader range of molecule-surface encounters, have begun to emerge out of the systematic and in-depth analyses of these and related studies."
https://openalex.org/W2045848068,"Kinetin [6-(2-furfuryl) aminopurine] and certain other 6-substituted aminopurines stimulated germination of seed of Striga asiatica (L.) Kuntze. Optimum concentration for most active compounds was in the range of 5 to 25 mg/lit. Derivatives which showed high activity possessed an adenine nucleus with a phenyl, benzyl, phenethyl, or furfuryl radical substituted on the amino group."
https://openalex.org/W1984965535,"In addition to the viviparous fish Mollienesia formosa, two other species of poeciliids have recently been found to produce only female offspring. The young of these females, however, unlike those of M. formosa, inherit characteristics from any one of the several species of males used in experimental matings."
https://openalex.org/W2088635138,"By projecting global population growth and demand for nonrenewable materials over the next century, it appears unlikely that the world will run short of any element before about 2050. This provides considerable time to develop new technology to economically exploit lower grade and alternative ores to bring some 30 elements into essentially infinite supply, and to use these elements in developing substitutes to satisfy the requirements of modern civilized societies."

https://openalex.org/W2068610194,"The growing store of carbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation is a far larger and more pervasive problem than acid rain. The predictions of the latest models that have been applied to the problem, called GCM-mixed-layer ocean models, predict a global temperature increase between 3.5 and 4.2 degrees Celsius. They predict that the warming will be larger near the poles than near the equator. They also predict increases and decreases in precipitation depending on location, the largest changes being between 30/sup 0/N and 30/sup 0/S. If CO/sub 2/ and trace gas concentrations continue to rise as projected and model calculations are essentially correct, the increasing global scale warming should become much more evident over the next few decades. 1 figure."
https://openalex.org/W1977166057,"The United States faces an international economic challenge that can best be met with a renewed emphasis on the basic science and engineering that underlies new technology. For 20 years, however, the nation has not invested adequately in the science and engineering base, with the result that we have too few young people entering science and engineering programs and inadequate facilities and equipment in the nation's universities. We need a fresh infusion of resources into the universities, together with a new emphasis on cooperative efforts between universities and industry. The engineering research centers recently established by the National Science Foundation are an example of how we should proceed."
https://openalex.org/W1978558314,"Cool Water, the world's first commercial-scale, integrated coal gasification combined cycle power plant, has been operating successfully since May 1984 near Barstow, California. The 100-megawatt plant, which was completed ahead of schedule and under budget, is probably the cleanest coal-fired power generating facility now in commercial operation. An ongoing demonstration program at Cool Water shows that future baseload power plants that use this technology can be built modularly in increments of a few hundred megawatts and compete economically with much larger, conventional coal-fired power plants equipped for flue gas desulfurization."
https://openalex.org/W2009843376,"Archaeopteryx lithographica might be regarded as the most important zoological species known, fossil or recent. Its importance lies not in that its transitional nature is unique-there are many such transitional forms at all taxonomic levels-but in the fact that it is an obvious and comprehensible example of organic evolution. There have been recent allegations that the feather impressions on Archaeopteryx are a forgery. In this report, proof of authenticity is provided by exactly matching hairline cracks and dendrites on the feathered areas of the opposing slabs, which show the absence of the artificial cement layer into which modern feathers could have been pressed by a forger."

https://openalex.org/W2011400944,"The Midco insect bed of Oklahoma and a newly discovered insect bed above this were traced across Kay County, Okla., into Sumner County, Kan. As a result, a greater time span is available for study of insect evolution during the mid-continent Permian, and the exact stratigraphic correlation of the Wellington of Oklahoma and Kansas can now be demonstrated. Four insect orders have thus far been identified from the new insect bed: Protodonata, Odonata, Protoperlaria, and Ephemeroptera. Numerous new species and higher categories are included in the collections from the two insect beds."
