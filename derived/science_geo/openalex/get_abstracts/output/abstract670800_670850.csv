https://openalex.org/W3129414840,"Antibodies are crucial to immune protection against SARS-CoV-2, with some in emergency use as therapeutics. Here, we identify 377 human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) recognizing the virus spike and focus mainly on 80 that bind the receptor binding domain (RBD). We devise a competition data-driven method to map RBD binding sites. We find that although antibody binding sites are widely dispersed, neutralizing antibody binding is focused, with nearly all highly inhibitory mAbs (IC50 < 0.1 μg/mL) blocking receptor interaction, except for one that binds a unique epitope in the N-terminal domain. Many of these neutralizing mAbs use public V-genes and are close to germline. We dissect the structural basis of recognition for this large panel of antibodies through X-ray crystallography and cryoelectron microscopy of 19 Fab-antigen structures. We find novel binding modes for some potently inhibitory antibodies and demonstrate that strongly neutralizing mAbs protect, prophylactically or therapeutically, in animal models."

The World Health Organisation has suggested that governments take a proactive response to vaccine hesitancy ‘hotspots’ based on social and behavioural insights. Methods Representative longitudinal online survey of over 3000 adults from Australia that examines the demographic, attitudinal, political and social attitudes and COVID-19 health behavior correlates of vaccine hesitance and resistance to a COVID-19 vaccine. Results Overall, 59% would definitely get the vaccine, 29% had low levels of hesitancy, 7% had high levels of hesitancy and 6% were resistant. Females, those living in disadvantaged areas, those who reported that risks of COVID-19 was overstated, those who had more populist views and higher levels of religiosity were more likely to be hesitant or resistant while those who had higher levels of household income, those who had higher levels of social distancing, who downloaded the COVID-Safe App, who had more confidence in their state or territory government or confidence in their hospitals, or were more supportive of migration were more likely to intend to get vaccinated. Conclusions Our findings suggest that vaccine hesitancy, which accounts for a significant proportion of the population can be addressed by public health messaging but for a significant minority of the population with strongly held beliefs, alternative policy measures may well be needed to achieve sufficient vaccination coverage to end the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3139399838,"The Slovakian test case Toward the end of 2020, Slovakia decided that it would test and then isolate positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cases among its entire population of ∼5.5 million, and more than 50,000 positive cases were found during a rapid antigen testing campaign. Pavelka et al. analyzed the data and found that in 41 counties before and after the two rounds of testing, infection prevalence declined by about 80% (see the Perspective by García-Fiñana and Buchan). They also used the data to test a microsimulation model for one county. Quarantine of the whole household after a positive test was essential to achieving a large reduction in prevalence. Since Autumn 2020, transmission in Slovakia has rebounded, despite other interventions, because high-intensity testing was not sustainable. Science , this issue p. 635 ; see also p. 571"

https://openalex.org/W3136211016,"Introduction The global COVID-19 pandemic has radically changed the way health care is delivered in many countries around the world. Evidence on the experience of those receiving or providing maternity care is important to guide practice through this challenging time. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in Australia. Five key stakeholder cohorts were included to explore and compare the experiences of those receiving or providing care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Women, their partners, midwives, medical practitioners and midwifery students who had received or provided maternity care from March 2020 onwards in Australia were recruited via social media and invited to participate in an online survey released between 13 th May and 24 th June 2020; a total of 3701 completed responses were received. Findings While anxiety related to COVID-19 was high among all five cohorts, there were statistically significant differences between the responses from each cohort for most survey items. Women were more likely to indicate concern about their own and family’s health and safety in relation to COVID-19 whereas midwives, doctors and midwifery students were more likely to be concerned about occupational exposure to COVID-19 through working in a health setting than those receiving care through attending these environments. Midwifery students and women’s partners were more likely to respond that they felt isolated because of the changes to the way care was provided. Despite concerns about care received or provided not meeting expectations, most respondents were satisfied with the quality of care provided, although midwives and midwifery students were less likely to agree. Conclusion This paper provides a unique exploration and comparison of experiences of receiving and providing maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. Findings are useful to support further service changes and future service redesign. New evidence provided offers unique insight into key stakeholders’ experiences of the rapid changes to health services."
https://openalex.org/W3138471714,"Background Socially vulnerable communities may be at higher risk for COVID-19 outbreaks in the US. However, no prior studies examined temporal trends and differential effects of social vulnerability on COVID-19 incidence and death rates. Therefore, we examined temporal trends among counties with high and low social vulnerability to quantify disparities in trends over time. Methods We conducted a longitudinal analysis examining COVID-19 incidence and death rates from March 15 to December 31, 2020, for each US county using data from USAFacts. We classified counties using the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), a percentile-based measure from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with higher values indicating more vulnerability. Using a Bayesian hierarchical negative binomial model, we estimated daily risk ratios (RRs) comparing counties in the first (lower) and fourth (upper) SVI quartiles, adjusting for rurality, percentage in poor or fair health, percentage female, percentage of smokers, county average daily fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ), percentage of primary care physicians per 100,000 residents, daily temperature and precipitation, and proportion tested for COVID-19. Results At the outset of the pandemic, the most vulnerable counties had, on average, fewer cases per 100,000 than least vulnerable SVI quartile. However, on March 28, we observed a crossover effect in which the most vulnerable counties experienced higher COVID-19 incidence rates compared to the least vulnerable counties (RR = 1.05, 95% PI: 0.98, 1.12). Vulnerable counties had higher death rates starting on May 21 (RR = 1.08, 95% PI: 1.00,1.16). However, by October, this trend reversed and the most vulnerable counties had lower death rates compared to least vulnerable counties. Conclusions The impact of COVID-19 is not static but can migrate from less vulnerable counties to more vulnerable counties and back again over time."
https://openalex.org/W3137713402,"Background Prior studies examining symptoms of COVID-19 are primarily descriptive and measured among hospitalized individuals. Understanding symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pre-clinical, community-based populations may improve clinical screening, particularly during flu season. We sought to identify key symptoms and symptom combinations in a community-based population using robust methods. Methods We pooled community-based cohorts of individuals aged 12 and older screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection in April and June 2020 for a statewide prevalence study. Main outcome was SARS-CoV-2 positivity. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for individual symptoms as well as symptom combinations. We further employed multivariable logistic regression and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to examine symptoms and combinations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results Among 8214 individuals screened, 368 individuals (4.5%) were RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2. Although two-thirds of symptoms were highly specific (&gt;90.0%), most symptoms individually possessed a PPV &lt;50.0%. The individual symptoms most greatly associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity were fever (OR = 5.34, p&lt;0.001), anosmia (OR = 4.08, p&lt;0.001), ageusia (OR = 2.38, p = 0.006), and cough (OR = 2.86, p&lt;0.001). Results from EFA identified two primary symptom clusters most associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection: (1) ageusia, anosmia, and fever; and (2) shortness of breath, cough, and chest pain. Moreover, being non-white (13.6% vs. 2.3%, p&lt;0.001), Hispanic (27.9% vs. 2.5%, p&lt;0.001), or living in an Urban area (5.4% vs. 3.8%, p&lt;0.001) was associated with infection. Conclusions Symptoms can help distinguish SARS-CoV-2 infection from other respiratory viruses, especially in community or urgent care settings where rapid testing may be limited. Symptoms should further be structured in clinical documentation to support identification of new cases and mitigation of disease spread by public health. These symptoms, derived from asymptomatic as well as mildly infected individuals, can also inform vaccine and therapeutic clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W3136129142,"New technologies are key to understanding the dynamic activity of neural circuits and systems in the brain. Here, we show that a minimally invasive approach based on ultrasound can be used to detect the neural correlates of movement planning, including directions and effectors. While non-human primates (NHPs) performed memory-guided movements, we used functional ultrasound (fUS) neuroimaging to record changes in cerebral blood volume with 100 μm resolution. We recorded from outside the dura above the posterior parietal cortex, a brain area important for spatial perception, multisensory integration, and movement planning. We then used fUS signals from the delay period before movement to decode the animals' intended direction and effector. Single-trial decoding is a prerequisite to brain-machine interfaces, a key application that could benefit from this technology. These results are a critical step in the development of neuro-recording and brain interface tools that are less invasive, high resolution, and scalable."

https://openalex.org/W3138400834,"SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus-2), cause of COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease of 2019), represents a significant risk to people living with pre-existing conditions associated with exacerbated inflammatory responses and consequent dysfunctional immunity. In this paper, we have evaluated the influence of obesity, a condition associated with chronic systemic inflammation, on the secretion of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies in the blood of COVID-19 patients. Our hypothesis is that obesity is associated with reduced amounts of specific IgG antibodies. Results have confirmed our hypothesis and have shown that SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies are negatively associated with Body Mass Index (BMI) in COVID-19 obese patients, as expected based on the known influence of obesity on humoral immunity. Antibodies in COVID-19 obese patients are also negatively associated with serum levels of pro-inflammatory and metabolic markers of inflammaging and pulmonary inflammation, such as SAA (serum amyloid A protein), CRP (C-reactive protein), and ferritin, but positively associated with NEFA (nonesterified fatty acids). These results altogether could help to identify an inflammatory signature with strong predictive value for immune dysfunction. Inflammatory markers identified may subsequently be targeted to improve humoral immunity in individuals with obesity and in individuals with other chronic inflammatory conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3137286529,"How organs sense circulating metabolites is a key question. Here, we show that the multispecific organic anion transporters of drugs, OAT1 (SLC22A6 or NKT) and OAT3 (SLC22A8), play a role in organ sensing. Metabolomics analyses of the serum of Oat1 and Oat3 knockout mice revealed changes in tryptophan derivatives involved in metabolism and signaling. Several of these metabolites are derived from the gut microbiome and are implicated as uremic toxins in chronic kidney disease. Direct interaction with the transporters was supported with cell-based transport assays. To assess the impact of the loss of OAT1 or OAT3 function on the kidney, an organ where these uptake transporters are highly expressed, knockout transcriptomic data were mapped onto a “metabolic task”-based computational model that evaluates over 150 cellular functions. Despite the changes of tryptophan metabolites in both knockouts, only in the Oat1 knockout were multiple tryptophan-related cellular functions increased. Thus, deprived of the ability to take up kynurenine, kynurenate, anthranilate, and N-formylanthranilate through OAT1, the kidney responds by activating its own tryptophan-related biosynthetic pathways. The results support the Remote Sensing and Signaling Theory, which describes how “drug” transporters help optimize levels of metabolites and signaling molecules by facilitating organ cross talk. Since OAT1 and OAT3 are inhibited by many drugs, the data implies potential for drug–metabolite interactions. Indeed, treatment of humans with probenecid, an OAT-inhibitor used to treat gout, elevated circulating tryptophan metabolites. Furthermore, given that regulatory agencies have recommended drugs be tested for OAT1 and OAT3 binding or transport, it follows that these metabolites can be used as endogenous biomarkers to determine if drug candidates interact with OAT1 and/or OAT3.

In addition, OATs help regulate levels of ingested natural products and gut microbiome-derived compounds (e.g., epicatechin, 3-indoxyl sulfate, p-cresol sulfate) (5Nigam S.K.

This group of drug transporters includes other members of the SLC (solute carrier) and the ABC (ATP-binding cassette) superfamilies (7Govindarajan R. Sparreboom A.

There is extensive literature on the pharmaceutical and toxicological roles of these transporters, yet the endogenous functions of these evolutionarily conserved proteins, as well as the regulatory network in which they participate, are only beginning to be characterized (9Nigam S.K.

These multispecific transporters influence many aspects of physiology and pathophysiology, likely by functioning in combination with mono- or oligo-specific transporters. Three well-characterized pathophysiological examples are the roles of OAT1, OAT3, URAT1, and ABCG2 in gout (10Bhatnagar V. Richard E.L. Wu W. Nievergelt C.M. Lipkowitz M.S. Jeff J. Maihofer A.X.

Therapeut. 2010; 125: 79-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Because of the vast array of small organic anion compounds transported by OAT1 and OAT3, a wide range of xenobiotics and endogenous molecules can conceivably compete for access to and renal clearance by these OAT transporters (14Lepist E.I.

This has important implications because many of the metabolites, including those arising from the gut microbiome and transported by OAT1 and OAT3, regulate endogenous physiology and have been linked to the development of clinical disorders, such as CKD, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes (14Lepist E.I.

For example, the amount of CMPF (3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropanoic acid), a substrate of OAT3, in the circulation has been related to diabetes. CMPF is a furan fatty acid metabolite that is found in fish oils, vegetable oils, butters, and other foods and perturbs pancreatic β cell function, leading to glucose intolerance (18Liu Y. Prentice K.J. Eversley J.A. Hu C. Batchuluun B. Leavey K. Hansen J.B. Wei D.W. Cox B. Dai F.H.F. Jia W.P. Wheeler M.B.

The potential consequences of transporter-level competition between a drug and the transported endogenous metabolite include: (a) altered intracellular concentrations of metabolites because a transported drug blocks metabolite entry into the cell; (b) altered serum concentrations of the drug, the metabolite, or both, leading to increased half-lives and/or metabolite levels; and (c) altered systemic metabolism arising from distal cascading effects on multiple metabolic pathways that depend upon OAT1 or OAT3 or both. We applied a systems biology approach that employed metabolomic and transcriptomic data from Oat1 and Oat3 knockout (KO) mice to analyze the major metabolic functions that are influenced by OAT1 and OAT3. The serum metabolomic data from the Oat1 and Oat3 KO mice represented the impact these transporters have on endogenous systemic metabolism. We used the transcriptomic data from the kidney, which is the site of expression of the encoding transporter genes, to evaluate the activity of hundreds of metabolic functions using metabolic task analysis. In doing so, we were able to complement an understanding of extracellular metabolite changes due to the loss of the OAT1 or OAT3 transporters with an analysis of affected intracellular metabolic pathways. Together, the multi-omics approach and systems biology analysis used here provide a portrait of the local and systemic metabolic and signaling pathways modulated separately and jointly by OAT1 and OAT3. We show that OAT1 not only regulates tryptophan metabolism systemically, but it also plays a key role in the tryptophan metabolic pathways inside the tissue where it is found. Thus, our results indicate that studies of new drug entities should not only consider drug–metabolite interaction (DMI) effects in the serum but also evaluate potential shifts in cellular metabolism due to loss of metabolite influx through competition at the level of the transporter. In support of the human relevance of our work, we show that many of the alterations in serum levels of tryptophan metabolites seen in the knockout mice are also observed in humans after administration of probenecid, a drug used to treat gout that inhibits OAT1 and OAT3. The SLC22 gene family (OATs, OCTs, OCTNs) encodes for transporters that participate in the uptake of many unique compounds across several tissues, though much of the research has focused on a handful of members (SLC22A1, SLC22A2, SLC22A6, SLC22A8) that handle many common drugs (20Engelhart D.C. Granados J.C. Shi D. Saier Jr., M.H. Baker Jr., M.E. Abagyan R. Nigam S.K. Systems biology analysis reveals eight SLC22 transporter subgroups, including OATs, OCTs, and OCTNs.Int. J. Mol.

Therapeut. 2010; 126: 200-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, these genes are highly conserved, with orthologs in fly, worm, fish, and sea urchin (22Zhu C. Nigam K.B. Date R.C.

To determine the endogenous roles of OAT1 and OAT3 in controlling tissue-level and organismal-level metabolism independent from their well-known roles as drug and toxin transporters, we analyzed tissue-specific transcriptomic data and serum metabolomic data (Fig. 1). We compared data from mice genetically deficient in either Oat1 or Oat3 and their wild-type controls. These data sets have previously been examined from a chemoinformatic perspective (23Nigam A.K.

Chem. 2017; 292: 15789-15803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), but here we place an emphasis on their specific role in the disposition of tryptophan metabolites. Because these two transporters are found in the kidney, we analyzed kidney transcriptomic data using Metabolic Task Analysis, a systems biology method that groups genes according to their coordinated roles in the biosynthesis of a limited set of key metabolite intermediates from diverse metabolite inputs (see Methods section for more details). We supported these studies with in vitro transport assays; we also support the clinical relevance of our findings with human metabolomics data. Almost all the characteristics of mice deficient in Oat1 or Oat3 are similar to those of wild-type mice (25Eraly S.A. Vallon V. Rieg T. Gangoiti J.A. Wikoff W.R. Siuzdak G. Barshop B.A. Nigam S.K.

https://openalex.org/W3138911380,"Australia is a relative laggard on climate policy, amidst social and political fractures despite rising support for climate policy in opinion polls. In the 2019 Australian federal election, which was dubbed the ‘climate election’, the opposition campaigned on comparatively ambitious climate action but the government was returned on a status quo policy. We explore the social-political determinants of climate attitudes and how they are positioned in relation to voting behaviour, in the context of the 2019 election. We use a large nationally representative survey of Australian voters (n = 2,033), and employ univariate and multivariate ordinal logistic regression models to uncover correlates. We find that a large majority of voters think it is important for Australia to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, the importance given to emissions reductions is sharply divided along lines of political party preference. Holding pro-climate action attitudes consistently correlates with voting for progressive political parties and having higher levels of education. We also find a strong age cohort divide, with younger people holding stronger pro-climate attitudes than older people, raising the question whether we are seeing the emergence of a new generation expressing strong pro-climate action and progressive political attitudes that will persist over time. We conduct population ageing scenarios to project changes to public opinion, by age group, into the future. These indicate that strong support for climate action would increase by about four percentage points over the coming decade as younger voters replace the old, if attitudes within cohorts remained fixed. We conclude that while cleavages in climate attitudes in Australia are set to continue, efforts to promote climate delay are bound to have a limited shelf life as a growing majority of voters accepts the need for climate action."
https://openalex.org/W3008392323,"The increasing amount of publicly available research data provides the opportunity to link and integrate data in order to create and prove novel hypotheses, to repeat experiments or to compare recent data to data collected at a different time or place. However, recent studies have shown that retrieving relevant data for data reuse is a time-consuming task in daily research practice. In this study, we explore what hampers dataset retrieval in biodiversity research, a field that produces a large amount of heterogeneous data. In particular, we focus on scholarly search interests and metadata, the primary source of data in a dataset retrieval system. We show that existing metadata currently poorly reflect information needs and therefore are the biggest obstacle in retrieving relevant data. Our findings indicate that for data seekers in the biodiversity domain environments, materials and chemicals, species, biological and chemical processes, locations, data parameters and data types are important information categories. These interests are well covered in metadata elements of domain-specific standards. However, instead of utilizing these standards, large data repositories tend to use metadata standards with domain-independent metadata fields that cover search interests only to some extent. A second problem are arbitrary keywords utilized in descriptive fields such as title, description or subject. Keywords support scholars in a full text search only if the provided terms syntactically match or their semantic relationship to terms used in a user query is known."
https://openalex.org/W3136136961,"Diatoms are unicellular photosynthetic algae known to secrete organic matter that fuels secondary production in the ocean, though our knowledge of how their physiology impacts the composition of dissolved organic matter remains limited. Like all photosynthetic organisms, their use of light for energy and reducing power creates the challenge of avoiding cellular damage. To better understand the interplay between redox balance and organic matter secretion, we reconstructed a genome-scale metabolic model of Thalassiosira pseudonana strain CCMP 1335, a model for diatom molecular biology and physiology, with a 60-year history of studies. The model simulates the metabolic activities of 1,432 genes via a network of 2,792 metabolites produced through 6,079 reactions distributed across six subcellular compartments. Growth was simulated under different steady-state light conditions (5–200 μmol photons m -2 s -1 ) and in a batch culture progressing from exponential growth to nitrate-limitation and nitrogen-starvation. We used the model to examine the dissipation of reductants generated through light-dependent processes and found that when available, nitrate assimilation is an important means of dissipating reductants in the plastid; under nitrate-limiting conditions, sulfate assimilation plays a similar role. The use of either nitrate or sulfate uptake to balance redox reactions leads to the secretion of distinct organic nitrogen and sulfur compounds. Such compounds can be accessed by bacteria in the surface ocean. The model of the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana provides a mechanistic explanation for the production of ecologically and climatologically relevant compounds that may serve as the basis for intricate, cross-kingdom microbial networks. Diatom metabolism has an important influence on global biogeochemistry; metabolic models of marine microorganisms link genes to ecosystems and may be key to integrating molecular data with models of ocean biogeochemistry."
https://openalex.org/W3136322666,"Gut physiology and the bacterial community play crucial roles in insect susceptibility to infections and insecticides. Interactions among Colorado potato beetle Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), its bacterial associates, pathogens and xenobiotics have been insufficiently studied. In this paper, we present our study of the survival, midgut histopathology, activity of digestive enzymes and bacterial communities of L . decemlineata larvae under the influence of Bacillus thuringiensis var. tenebrionis ( morrissoni ) ( Bt ), a natural complex of avermectins and a combination of both agents. Moreover, we estimated the impact of culturable enterobacteria on the susceptibility of the larvae to Bt and avermectins. An additive effect between Bt and avermectins was established regarding the mortality of the larvae. Both agents led to the destruction of midgut tissues, a decrease in the activity of alpha-amylases and alkaline proteinases, a decrease in the Spiroplasma leptinotarsae relative abundance and a strong elevation of Enterobacteriaceae abundance in the midgut. Moreover, an elevation of the enterobacterial CFU count was observed under the influence of Bt and avermectins, and the greatest enhancement was observed after combined treatment. Insects pretreated with antibiotics were less susceptible to Bt and avermectins, but reintroduction of the predominant enterobacteria Enterobacter ludwigii , Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens increased susceptibility to both agents. We suggest that enterobacteria play an important role in the acceleration of Bt infection and avermectin toxicoses in L . decemlineata and that the additive effect between Bt and avermectin may be mediated by alterations in the bacterial community."

Methods A longitudinal cohort analysis of Washington State Department of Health COVID-19 confirmed case age distribution 1) March-April 2020 (N = 13,934) and 2) March-August 2020 (N = 76,032) for proportional change over time using chi square tests for significance. Results From March 1st to April 19, 2020 COVID-19 age distribution shifted with a 10% decline in cases age 60 years and older and a 20% increase in age 0-19/20-39 years (chi-square = 223.10, p &lt; .001). Number of cases over the initial analysis period were 0–19 years n = 515, 20–39 years n = 4078, 40–59 years n = 4788, 60–79 years n = 3221, 80+ years n = 1332. After the peak (March 22, 2020), incidence declined in older age groups and increased among age 0–19 and 20–39 age groups from 20% to 40% of total cases by April 19 and 50% by May 3. During this time testing expanded with more testing among older age groups and less testing among younger age groups while case positivity shifted young. Percent positive cases age 0-19/20-39 years through August 2020 increased to a consistent average of 60% [age 0–19 increased to 19% (N = 10257), age 20–39 increased to 42% (N = 30215)]. Conclusions An increased sustained proportion of COVID-19 incidence is present among children (age 0–19) and young adults (age 20–39) indicating an elevated role in disease spread during the epidemic creating a possible reservoir of disease with spillover risk to more vulnerable older persons and those with comorbid conditions. Media savvy age-appropriate messaging to enhance mitigation compliance among less vulnerable, more mobile and lower priority vaccination age groups will be a continued necessity and priority to reduce overall population incidence."
https://openalex.org/W3137055189,"Background Acne vulgaris and rosacea are common inflammatory complications of the skin, both characterized by abnormal infiltration of immune cells. The two diseases can be differentiated based on characteristic profile of the immune cell infiltrates at the periphery of disease lesions. In addition, dysregulated infiltration of immune cells not only occur in the acne lesions but also in non-lesional areas of patients with the disease, thus characterizing the immune infiltration in these sites can further enhance our understanding on the pathogenesis of acne. Methods Five microarray data-sets (GSE108110, GSE53795, GSE65914, GSE14905 and GSE78097) were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus. After removing the batch effects and normalizing the data, we applied the CIBERSORT algorithm combined with signature matrix LM22, to describe 22 types of immune cells’ infiltration in acne less than 48 hour (H) old, in comparation with non-lesional skin of acne patients, healthy skin and rosacea (including erythematotelangiectatic rosacea, papulopustular rosacea and phymatous rosacea) and we compared gene expression of Th1 and Th17-related molecules in acne, rosacea and healthy control. Results Compared with the non-lesional skin of acne patients, healthy individuals and rosacea patients, there is a significant increase in infiltration of neutrophils, monocytes and activated mast cells around the acne lesions, less than 48 H after their development. Contrarily, few naive CD4+ T cells, plasma cells, memory B cells and resting mast cells infiltrate acne sites compared to the aforementioned groups of individuals. Moreover, the infiltration of Regulatory T cells (Tregs) in acne lesions is substantially lower, relative to non-lesional sites of acne patients and skin of healthy individuals. In addition, non-lesional sites of acne patients exhibit lower infiltration of activated memory CD4+ T cells, plasma cells, memory B cells, M0 macrophages, neutrophils, resting mast cells but higher infiltration of Tregs and resting dendritic cells relative to skin of healthy individuals. Intriguingly, we found that among the 3 rosacea subtypes, the immune infiltration profile of papulopustular rosacea is the closest to that of acne lesions. In addition, through gene expression analysis of acne, rosacea and skin tissues of healthy individuals, we found a higher infiltration of Th1 and Th17 cells in acne lesions, relative to non-lesional skin areas of acne patients. Conclusions Our study provides new insights into the inflammatory pathogenesis of acne, and the difference between acne and rosacea, which helps in differentiating the two diseases. Our findings also guide on appropriate target therapy of the immune cell infiltrates in the two disease conditions."

In samples from the Ashkenazi Jewish population, we report that schizophrenia cases had a greater frequency of novel missense or loss of function (MisLoF) ultra-rare variants (URVs) compared to controls, and the MisLoF URV burden was inversely correlated with polygenic risk scores in cases. Characterizing 141 ""case-only"" genes (MisLoF URVs in ≥3 cases with none in controls), the cadherin gene set was associated with schizophrenia. We report a recurrent case mutation in PCDHA3 that results in the formation of cytoplasmic aggregates and failure to engage in homophilic interactions on the plasma membrane in cultured cells. Modeling purifying selection, we demonstrate that deleterious URVs are greatly overrepresented in the Ashkenazi population, yielding enhanced power for association studies.

To take into account potential endogeneity, the instrumental variables (IV) approach is employed, with partners' education as an instrument. The findings show that higher education levels lead to a higher level of eudaimonic well-being, hedonic well-being, positive affect, and reduced psychological distress, highlighting a non-monetary benefit of education. Thus, policymakers should continue to widely promote education, in order for women to achieve higher levels of future well-being. Additionally, the findings show that the connection between education and well-being is mediated by healthy behaviors, such as engaging in physical activity, abstaining from drinking and smoking, social interactivity, and higher income. Therefore, public health campaigns which promote healthy behaviors among women should potentially mitigate gaps in formal education."
https://openalex.org/W3135955492,"Inequality is present to varying degrees in all human societies, pre-modern and contemporary. For archaeological contexts, variation in house size reflects differences in labor investments and serves as a robust means to assess wealth across populations small and large. The Gini coefficient, which measures the degree of concentration in the distribution of units within a population, has been employed as a standardized metric to evaluate the extent of inequality. Here, we employ Gini coefficients to assess wealth inequality at four nested socio-spatial scales–the micro-region, the polity, the district, and the neighborhood–at two medium size, peripheral Classic Maya polities located in southern Belize. We then compare our findings to Gini coefficients for other Classic Maya polities in the Maya heartland and to contemporaneous polities across Mesoamerica. We see the patterning of wealth inequality across the polities as a consequence of variable access to networks of exchange. Different forms of governance played a role in the degree of wealth inequality in Mesoamerica. More autocratic Classic Maya polities, where principals exercised degrees of control over exclusionary exchange networks, maintained high degrees of wealth inequality compared to most other Mesoamerican states, which generally are characterized by more collective forms of governance. We examine how household wealth inequality was reproduced at peripheral Classic Maya polities, and illustrate that economic inequity trickled down to local socio-spatial units in this prehispanic context."

In that context, we assessed the phenotypic and molecular features of a collection of ESBL-Kp isolates in a French university hospital and evaluated the occurrence of potential cross-transmissions. Over a 2-year period (2017–2018), 204 non-duplicate isolates of ESBL-Kp were isolated from clinical (n = 118, 57.8%) or screening (n = 86, 42.2%) sample cultures. These isolates were predominantly resistant to cotrimoxazole (88.8%) and ofloxacin (82.8%) but remained susceptible to imipenem (99.3%) and amikacin (93.8%). CTX-M-15 was the most frequent ESBL identified (83.6%). Multilocus sequence typing and pulse-field gel electrophoresis analysis showed an important genetic variability with 41 sequence types (ST) and 50 pulsotypes identified, and the over representation of the international epidemic clones ST307 and ST405. An epidemiological link attesting probable cross-transmission has been identified for 16 patients clustered in 4 groups during the study period. In conclusion, we showed here the dissemination of pandemic clones of ESBL-Kp in our hospital on a background of clonal diversity."

https://openalex.org/W3139376637,"Naegleria fowleri is a pathogenic, thermophilic, free-living amoeba which causes primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). Penetrating the olfactory mucosa, the brain-eating amoeba travels along the olfactory nerves, burrowing through the cribriform plate to its destination: the brain’s frontal lobes. The amoeba thrives in warm, freshwater environments, with peak infection rates in the summer months and has a mortality rate of approximately 97%. A major contributor to the pathogen’s high mortality is the lack of sensitivity of N . fowleri to current drug therapies, even in the face of combination-drug therapy. To enable rational drug discovery and design efforts we have pursued protein production and crystallography-based structure determination efforts for likely drug targets from N . fowleri . The genes were selected if they had homology to drug targets listed in Drug Bank or were nominated by primary investigators engaged in N . fowleri research. In 2017, 178 N . fowleri protein targets were queued to the Seattle Structural Genomics Center of Infectious Disease (SSGCID) pipeline, and to date 89 soluble recombinant proteins and 19 unique target structures have been produced. Many of the new protein structures are potential drug targets and contain structural differences compared to their human homologs, which could allow for the development of pathogen-specific inhibitors. Five of the structures were analyzed in more detail, and four of five show promise that selective inhibitors of the active site could be found. The 19 solved crystal structures build a foundation for future work in combating this devastating disease by encouraging further investigation to stimulate drug discovery for this neglected pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W3139378956,"New Zealand had 1499 cases of COVID-19 before eliminating transmission of the virus. Extensive contract tracing during the outbreak has resulted in a dataset of epidemiologically linked cases. This data contains useful information about the transmission dynamics of the virus, its dependence on factors such as age, and its response to different control measures. We use Monte-Carlo network construction techniques to provide an estimate of the number of secondary cases for every individual infected during the outbreak. We then apply standard statistical techniques to quantify differences between groups of individuals. Children under 10 years old are significantly under-represented in the case data. Children infected fewer people on average and had a lower probability of transmitting the disease in comparison to adults and the elderly. Imported cases infected fewer people on average and also had a lower probability of transmitting than domestically acquired cases. Superspreading is a significant contributor to the epidemic dynamics, with 20% of cases among adults responsible for 65–85% of transmission. Subclinical cases infected fewer individuals than clinical cases. After controlling for outliers serial intervals were approximated with a normal distribution ( μ = 4.4 days, σ = 4.7 days). Border controls and strong social distancing measures, particularly when targeted at superspreading, play a significant role in reducing the spread of COVID-19."

Overall, the ancestrally reconstructed mammalian AncFMO1 serves as the first structural model to corroborate and rationalize the catalytic properties of FMO1. For dealing with endogenous and foreign toxic compounds, mammals and other animals developed oxidative systems that clear such potentially harmful elements from cells and tissues (1Krueger S.K. Williams D.E. Mammalian flavin-containing monooxygenases: structure/function, genetic polymorphisms and role in drug metabolism.Pharmacol. Ther. 2005; 106: 357-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The oxygenation of these molecules allows them to be recognized, degraded, excreted, or activated. In humans, this oxidative detoxification system is mostly based on the activity of cytochromes P450 (CYPs) monooxygenases and the flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs; EC 1.14.13.8). Significant advances have been made toward the characterization of human FMOs (hFMOs), but these enzymes still remain significantly less studied than CYPs. This may partly be due to the fact that CYPs are more numerous in the human proteome (57 CYPs versus 5 FMOs). Another factor that explains the limited insights into the functioning behind the membrane-bound hFMOs is the difficulty with which they are expressed as recombinant proteins and their challenging isolation. It is nonetheless well established that hFMOs play a crucial role in xenobiotic metabolism (2Phillips I.R. Shephard E.A.

There are 5 FMO paralogs in the human genome (FMO1-5), all clustered on chromosome 1 (4Shephard E.A. Dolphin C.T. Fox M.F. Povey S. Smith R. Phillips I.R.

A sixth gene, called FMO6, is also present but is not translated and thus referred to as a pseudogene (6Hines R.N. Hopp K.A. Franco J. Saeian K. Begun F.P. Alternative processing of the human FMO6 gene renders transcripts incapable of encoding a functional flavin-containing monooxygenase.Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The expression of hFMOs varies across the developmental stage and tissues. hFMO3 and hFMO5 transcripts are predominant in the liver, whereas hFMO2 is mostly found in the lung and hFMO1 in the kidney (7Dolphin C.T. Cullingford T.E. Shephard E.A. Smith R.L. Phillips I.R. Differential developmental and tissue-specific regulation of expression of the genes encoding three members of the flavin-containing monooxygenase family of man, FMO1, FMO3 and FMO4.Eur. J.

Dispos. 2006; 34: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). A good example of the pharmacological relevance of hFMOs is the role of FMO3 in the metabolic disorder called trimethylaminuria, also known as fish odor syndrome (9Basarab T. Ashton G.H.S. Menagé H.D.P. McGrath J.A. Sequence variations in the flavin-containing mono-oxygenase 3 gene (FMO3) in fish odour syndrome.Br. J. Dermatol. 1999; 140: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Mutations in the gene encoding hFMO3 result in an inactive form of this FMO, unable to metabolize trimethylamine. The accumulation of this food ingredient in the body results in a strong unpleasant odor that may lead to social isolation and other negative effects (10Phillips I.R. Shephard E.A. Flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3): genetic variants and their consequences for drug metabolism and disease.Xenobiotica. 2020; 50: 19-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). FMOs present a tightly bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) as the prosthetic group (11Cashman J.R. Zhang J. Human flavin-containing monooxygenases.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2006; 46: 65-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 12Ziegler D.M. An overview of the mechanism, substrate specificities, and structure of FMOs.Drug Metab. Rev. 2002; 34: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Although there are many other FMOs that are not sequence-related to FMOs, this abbreviation has persisted in literature to be used to denote this specific class of detoxifying enzymes (13van Berkel W.J.H. Kamerbeek N.M. Fraaije M.W. Flavoprotein monooxygenases, a diverse class of oxidative biocatalysts.J. Biotechnol. 2006; 124: 670-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The biochemical properties of mammalian FMOs were first described using enzymes from pig liver microsomes by Ziegler and Poulson in 1970 (14Ziegler D.M. Poulsen L.L. Hepatic microsomal mixed-function amine oxidase.Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In two extensive studies, Beaty and Ballou unraveled the catalytic mechanism involving the formation of a C(4α)-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate that performs the oxygenation (15Beaty N.B. Ballou D.P. The reductive half-reaction of liver microsomal FAD-containing monooxygenase.J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4611-4618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Beaty N.B. Ballou D.P. The oxidative half-reaction of liver microsomal FAD-containing monooxygenase∗.J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4619-4625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Formation of this reactive enzyme intermediate is achieved by a stepwise process in which first the FAD is reduced by a hydride transfer from the NADPH (Fig. 1A). With the oxidized nicotinamide still bound, the reduced flavin is able to react with molecular oxygen resulting in a relatively stable C(4α)-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate (Fig. 1B). In the next step, when the substrate approaches the flavin, the peroxy moiety transfers an oxygen atom to a soft-nucleophilic substrate (Fig. 1D), whereas the other oxygen atom is released as water (Fig. 1E). The last step is the release of NADP+ (Fig. 1F) (17Campbell A.C. Robinson R. Mena-aguilar D. Sobrado P. Tanner J.J. Structural determinants of flavin dynamics in a class B monooxygenase.ACS Biochem. 2020; 59: 4609-4616Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). If there is no suitable substrate bound close enough to the flavin cofactor, hydrogen peroxide is formed, which is commonly referred to as uncoupling (Fig. 1C). The burst of genomic information in the last decades plus the ease of gene synthesis has enabled ancestral-sequence reconstruction (ASR) studies. ASR consists of identifying the path of changes that occur during the evolution of a specific enzyme family through the inference of the ancestors’ sequences (18Siddiq M.A. Hochberg G.K. Thornton J.W. Evolution of protein specificity: insights from ancestral protein reconstruction.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2017; 47: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). By expressing and isolating ancestrally reconstructed proteins, it is possible to follow their biochemical features or structural modifications over time in comparison with extant enzymes (19Hochberg G.K.A. Thornton J.W. Reconstructing ancient proteins to understand the causes of structure and function.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2017; 46: 247-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 20Merkl R. Sterner R. Ancestral protein reconstruction: techniques and applications.Biol. Chem. 2016; 397: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). ASR has many applications for enzymologists, from the characterization of ancestral enzymes’ promiscuity or stability to the deciphering of evolutionary paths by gene duplications or the refinement of enzyme complexes (21Voordeckers K. Brown C.A. Vanneste K. van der Zande E. Voet A. Maere S. Verstrepen K.J.

Single-molecule paleoenzymology probes the chemistry of resurrected enzymes.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18: 592-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In our previous study, using ASR, we managed to express, purify, and crystallize the mammalian ancestors of FMO2, FMO3-6, and FMO5 (23Nicoll C.R. Bailleul G. Fiorentini F. Mascotti M.L. Fraaije M.W. Mattevi A. Ancestral-sequence reconstruction unveils the structural basis of function in mammalian FMOs.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2020; 27: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This resulted in detailed structural insights of these resurrected FMOs. In this work, we aimed at reconstructing the ancestral mammalian FMO1 and FMO4 proteins. Surprisingly, FMO1 is one of the less studied hFMOs despite the fact that it was used as model FMO in the pioneering studies by Beaty and Ballou (15Beaty N.B. Ballou D.P.

The oxidative half-reaction of liver microsomal FAD-containing monooxygenase∗.J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4619-4625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Critically, it has been established that hFMO1 displays a broad range of substrates, accepting drugs such as benzydamine, ethionamide, tamoxifen, or voriconazole (2Phillips I.R. Shephard E.A. Drug metabolism by flavin-containing monooxygenases of human and mouse.Expert Opin. Drug Metab. Toxicol. 2017; 13: 167-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We present for the first time the crystal structure of AncFMO1 together with its catalytic and kinetic features. These data shed light on the different enzymatic behaviors of mammalian FMOs and will improve our understanding of their physiological roles. Sequence analysis has shown that the FMO paralogs emerged at the time of tetrapod evolution and all five FMO paralogs were encoded in the genome of the mammalian ancestor, 177 mya (24Kumar S. Stecher G. Suleski M. Hedges S.B. TimeTree: a resource for timelines, timetrees, and divergence times.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2017; 34: 1812-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, Fig. S1, Table S1). Ancestral flavin-containing monooxygenase (AncFMO)1 was reconstructed with high confidence (overall posterior probability [PP] of 0.95). This sequence shows the typical length exhibited by other mammalian FMOs (531 amino acids) and shares 89.8% sequence identity (54 residue changes) with hFMO1. We found that 10 sites were ambiguously reconstructed (Data S1). AncFMO4 was also reconstructed with high PP (0.97) with 24 ambiguously reconstructed sites (Data S1). This enzyme exhibits a C-terminal extension of approximately 20 amino acids, and its length was 559 amino acids. The sequence identity compared with hFMO4 was 89.8% (57 changes). Full-length AncFMO1 and AncFMO4 were selected for experimental characterization. Synthetic genes encoding proteins with the second-best state at each of the ambiguously reconstructed sites (alternative amino acids) were also obtained to produce the alternative versions (AltAncFMOs) and assess the robustness of the reconstruction. No expression of AncFMO4 or AltAncFMO4 was observed after growth at 24 °C or 17 °C. Lack of expression was confirmed through Western blot analysis by using a 6xHis-tag–fused peroxidase monoclonal primary antibody. The cell lysate and insoluble membrane pellets incubated with a range of detergents failed to show protein expression (Fig. S2). The characteristic C-terminal extension after the transmembrane domain apparently prevents its proper expression in agreement with previous literature (25Itagaki K. Carver G.T. Philpot R.M. Expression and characterization of a modified flavin-containing monooxygenase 4 from humans.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20102-20107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). By contrast, up to 20 mg per liter of culture of AncFMO1 and AltAncFMO1 could be purified as FAD-containing proteins as evidenced by its intense yellow color. Furthermore, through Western blot analysis, AncFMO1 was demonstrated to be extracted from the membrane fraction using a range of different detergents (Fig. S2). The melting temperature (Tm) of AncFMO1 was evaluated using a Tycho NT.6 system to assess its stability (see Experimental procedures). The AncFMOs that we studied previously displayed high thermal robustness (Tm of the native enzyme ranged between 53 and 60 °C). AncFMO1 instead exhibited a relatively low Tm of 47 °C that increased to 52 °C in the presence of 200-μM NADP+ (Table S2). We first verified whether AncFMO1 was functional by testing known substrates of hFMOs. Gratifyingly, we found that AncFMO1 is indeed active on benzydamine, an anti-inflammatory drug (26Hu S.X. Hepatic flavin-containing monooxygenase and aldehyde oxidase activities in male domestic pigs at different ages.Drug Metab. Lett. 2018; 12: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), exhibiting typical Michaelis–Menten kinetic behavior (Table 1, Fig. S3). A kcat of 0.18 s−1 was obtained which is very similar to what was previously determined for FMO1 from the cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis) (0.17 s−1) (27Uno Y. Shimizu M. Yamazaki H. Molecular and functional characterization of flavin-containing monooxygenases in cynomolgus macaque.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2013; 85: 1837-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). AncFMO1 was also found to accept the prototypical FMO substrate, thioanisole (0.19 s−1). The alternative FMO1 ancestor, AltAncFMO1, displayed a similar activity toward benzydamine and thioanisole, with a rate of 0.20 s−1 and 0.16 s−1 in presence of 0.4-mM substrate, respectively, thus demonstrating the robustness of the reconstruction. The nicotinamide cofactor specificity of AncFMO1 was also explored. The kinetic analysis revealed that both the nicotinamide cofactors, NADH and NADPH, are accepted as electron donors. Although similar rates of catalysis were obtained, the KM for NADPH was significantly lower than the KM for NADH (Table 1). In the absence of any organic substrate, AncFMO1 displayed a similar uncoupling (i.e., the oxidation of NAD(P)H leading to the release of hydrogen peroxide) rate regardless of the cofactor, 0.13 and 0.11 s−1 for NADPH and NADH, respectively. Once again, the KM for NADH was higher than that for NADPH (Table 1). It should be noted that hFMO1 was also previously shown to be highly uncoupled, producing H2O2 in higher amounts than hFMO2 and hFMO3 (28Siddens L.K. Krueger S.K. Henderson M.C. Williams D.E.

Having established that AncFMO1 is enzymatically active, we sought to further characterize the enzymatic conversions and the resulting products (Table S3). Benzydamine is converted to didesmethyl-benzydamine by CYPs, whereas hFMO1 transforms it into the corresponding N-oxide (26Hu S.X. Hepatic flavin-containing monooxygenase and aldehyde oxidase activities in male domestic pigs at different ages.Drug Metab. Lett. 2018; 12: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 29Kawaji A. Ohara K. Takabatake E. An assay of flavin-containing monooxygenase activity with benzydamine N-oxidation.Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 409-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Using HPLC analysis, we found that also AncFMO1 converts benzydamine into its N-oxide. Thioanisole was converted into the corresponding sulfoxide with high enantioselectivity, producing mainly the (R)-enantiomer. To probe the activity of AncFMO1 toward a bulky molecule, tamoxifen (an antiestrogen drug (30Fisher B. Costantino J.P. Wickerham D.L. Cecchini R.S. Cronin W.M. Robidoux A. Bevers T.B. Kavanah M.T.

Cancer Inst. 2005; 97: 1652-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar)), was tested as a substrate. We found that tamoxifen was converted into the N-oxide derivative, as previously reported for hFMO1 (31Chitra M. Ernest H. David K. Metabolism of the cancer agent tamoxifen : flavin-containing monooxygenase-mediated N-oxidation.Drug Metab. Dispos. 1993; 21: 657-661PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether in addition to N- and S-oxidations AncFMO1 catalyzes also Baeyer–Villiger oxidations, two ketones were assessed as potential substrates, hepta-2-one and bicyclo[3.2.0]hept-2-en-6-one (32Fiorentini F. Romero E. Fraaije M.W. Faber K. Hall M. Mattevi A. Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase FMO5 as entry point in drug metabolism.ACS Chem. Biol. 2017; 12: 2379-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 33Fiorentini F. Geier M. Binda C. Winkler M. Faber K. Hall M. Mattevi A. Biocatalytic characterization of human FMO5: enearthing Baeyer-Villiger reactions in humans.ACS Chem. Biol. 2016; 11: 1039-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although no conversion of hepta-2-one was observed, bicyclo[3.2.0]hept-2-en-6-one was partly converted, implying some moderate Baeyer–Villiger oxidation activity. Upon harvesting the cells, it became clear that a blue pigment had been formed as evidenced by colored cell pellets upon centrifugation. For microbial FMOs, it has been shown that they form indigo blue when expressed in Escherichia coli (34Fabara A.N. Fraaije M.W. An overview of microbial indigo-forming enzymes.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2020; 104: 925-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus, it is most likely that AncFMO1 converts indole into indoxyl that spontaneously dimerizes to form indigo blue. To verify this, the purified enzyme was incubated for 1 h at 30 °C with indole and a NADPH regeneration system, which indeed resulted in formation of indigo (Fig. S4). Collectively, these data demonstrated that AncFMO1 featured all the typical properties of FMOs and was able to convert known FMO1 substrates. Both the reductive and oxidative half reactions were investigated separately using the stopped-flow technique. The first steps of the catalytic cycle of FMOs involve the binding of NADPH after which the FAD is reduced through a direct hydride transfer. The reductive half reaction can be monitored spectrophotometrically by mixing the enzyme with NADPH under anoxic conditions because the reduction of the flavin can be easily measured by following the decrease of absorbance at 448 nm. We determined the reduction rates at different NADPH concentrations (Fig. 3A). Fitting the data resulted in a relatively fast reduction rate constant with kred = 16.7 s−1 and a dissociation constant of 110 μM. The kinetic and spectral data indicate that flavin reduction takes place in a single irreversible hydride transfer step. We also monitored the reductive half reaction using NADH, resulting in a similar reduction rate constant (kred = 17.2 s−1) and a dissociation constant of 958 μM, which is almost 9 times higher than when using NADPH. The presence of 1.0-mM thioanisole did not affect the rate of reduction, suggesting that flavin reduction precedes binding of substrate as has been proposed for other class B flavoprotein monooxygenases (13van Berkel W.J.H. Kamerbeek N.M. Fraaije M.W. Flavoprotein monooxygenases, a diverse class of oxidative biocatalysts.J. Biotechnol. 2006; 124: 670-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). By preparing anaerobically reduced AncFMO1, the oxidative half reaction could be monitored by mixing it with dioxygen-containing buffer. For several FMOs, the reaction of reduced enzyme with dioxygen results in the formation of a C(4α)-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate with absorbance features around 360 to 380 nm (35Romero E. Robinson R. Sobrado P. Monitoring the reductive and oxidative half-reactions of a flavin-dependent monooxygenase using stopped-flow spectrophotometry.J. Vis. Exp. 2012; 10: 3791-3803Google Scholar). The intermediate subsequently decays at varying rates, depending on its stabilization by the enzyme. For AncFMO1, when mixed as reduced enzyme with dioxygen, a rapid increase of absorbance at both 368 nm and 448 nm was observed and we were unable to distinguish intermediate formation from the full reoxidation of the flavin (Fig. 3B). This shows that there was only a minor buildup of the C(4α)-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate and indicates that AncFMO1 is not good at stabilizing the oxygenating enzyme intermediate. This observation is consistent with the sustained uncoupling featured by AncFMO1 (Table 1). The rate of reoxidation of the reduced AncFMO1 in presence of 260-μM dioxygen was around 2 s−1 (Fig. 3C), whereas the steady-state kinetics of uncoupling suggested a slower reaction with a rate only reaching 0.12 s−1 (Table 1). These kinetic data show that AncFMO1 displays a similar kinetic behavior when compared with other FMOs. We were able to successfully crystallize AncFMO1 and to solve its structure at 3.0 Å resolution (Fig. 4A, Table 2, Fig. S5). STARANISO, an anisotropy correction server, was critical to correct for the anisotropy of crystals leading to drastically improved electron density maps. The asymmetric unit consisted of two dimers (Table 2), and the dimerization observed for AncFMO1 is the same as for the dimers documented by the other AncFMO crystal structures (23Nicoll C.R. Bailleul G. Fiorentini F. Mascotti M.L. Fraaije M.W. Mattevi A. Ancestral-sequence reconstruction unveils the structural basis of function in mammalian FMOs.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2020; 27: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). Consistently, the structure of AncFMO1 possesses key structural domains and folds canonical to the mammalian FMOs (Fig. 4A). Alongside the well-conserved NAD(P)H- and FAD-binding domains, known as the paired Rossmann fold, AncFMO1 includes a large 80-residue insertion, two small α-helical triads that form the hydrophobic ridge that embeds into the phospholipid bilayer, and a large transmembrane C-terminal helix that drills into the membrane. In addition, in accordance with the previously described AncFMOs, AncFMO1 displayed large hydrophobic strips on the surface of the crystal structure that promote monotopic membrane association (Fig. S6) (22Perez-Jimenez R.

The oxidized coenzyme, NADP+, was successfully bound in the crystal structure and two glycerol molecules were found located near/at the active site. Owing to weak electron density and a highly disordered peptide backbone, the C-terminal helices were poorly constructed in the crystal structure. Nevertheless, resolved detergent molecules demarcated the protein–membrane interface that was illustrated by other AncFMOs (23Nicoll C.R. Bailleul G. Fiorentini F. Mascotti M.L. Fraaije M.W.

In addition, pairwise structural superpositions between AncFMO1 and AncFMO3-6 monomers (sequence identity 59%) portrayed an RMSD of 0.8 A over 449 Cα atoms, corroborating a high protein scaffold similarity. The crystal structure revealed that the ambiguous sites of the AltAncFMO1 sequence were all peripheral from the active site and not expected to impact enzymatic activity.

https://openalex.org/W3136940761,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer and the third most frequent cause of male cancer death in Germany. MicroRNAs (miRNA) appear to be involved in the development and progression of PCa. A diagnostic differentiation from benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) is often only possible through transrectal punch biopsy. This procedure is described as painful and carries risks. It was investigated whether urinary miRNAs can be used as biomarkers to differentiate the prostate diseases above. Therefore urine samples from urological patients with BPH (25) or PCa (28) were analysed using Next-Generation Sequencing to detect the expression profile of total and exosomal miRNA/piRNA. 79 miRNAs and 5 piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) were significantly differentially expressed (adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05 and log2-Fc &gt; 1 or &lt; -1). Of these, 6 miRNAs and 2 piRNAs could be statistically validated (AUC on test cohort &gt; = 0.7). In addition, machine-learning algorithms were used to identify a panel of 22 additional miRNAs, whose interaction makes it possible to differentiate the groups as well. There are promising individual candidates for potential use as biomarkers in prostate cancer. The innovative approach of applying machine learning methods to this kind of data could lead to further small RNAs coming into scientific focus, which have so far been neglected."
https://openalex.org/W3138768440,"Background Climate change is expected to decrease food security globally. Many Indigenous communities have heightened sensitivity to climate change and food insecurity for multifactorial reasons including close relationships with the local environment and socioeconomic inequities which increase exposures and challenge adaptation to climate change. Pregnant women have additional sensitivity to food insecurity, as antenatal undernutrition is linked with poor maternal-infant health. This study examined pathways through which climate change influenced food security during pregnancy among Indigenous and non-Indigenous women in rural Uganda. Specific objectives were to characterize: 1) sensitivities to climate-associated declines in food security for pregnant Indigenous women; 2) women’s perceptions of climate impacts on food security during pregnancy; and 3) changes in food security and maternal-infant health over time, as observed by women. Methods Using a community-based research approach, we conducted eight focus group discussions—four in Indigenous Batwa communities and four in non-Indigenous communities—in Kanungu District, Uganda, on the subject of climate and food security during pregnancy. Thirty-six women with ≥1 pregnancy participated. Data were analysed using a constant comparative method and thematic analysis. Results Women indicated that food insecurity was common during pregnancy and had a bidirectional relationship with antenatal health issues. Food security was thought to be decreasing due to weather changes including extended droughts and unpredictable seasons harming agriculture. Women linked food insecurity with declines in maternal-infant health over time, despite improved antenatal healthcare. While all communities described food security struggles, the challenges Indigenous women identified and described were more severe. Conclusions Programs promoting women’s adaptive capacity to climate change are required to improve food security for pregnant women and maternal-infant health. These interventions are particularly needed in Indigenous communities, which often face underlying health inequities. However, resiliency among mothers was strong and, with supports, they can reduce food security challenges in a changing climate."
https://openalex.org/W3137358720,"Combined application of biochar and nitrogen (N) fertilizer has the potential to reduce N losses from soil. However, the effectiveness of biochar amendment on N management can vary with biochar types with different physical and chemical properties. This study aimed to assess the effect of two types of hardwood biochar with different ash contents and cation exchange capacity (CEC) on soil N mineralization and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) production when applied alone and in combination with N fertilizer. Soil samples collected from a temperate pasture system were amended with two types of biochar (B1 and B2), urea, and urea plus biochar, and incubated for 60 days along with soil control (without biochar or urea addition). Soil nitrate N, ammonium N, ammonia-oxidizing bacteria amo A gene transcripts, and N 2 O production were measured during the experiment. Compared to control, addition of B1 (higher CEC and lower ash content) alone decreased nitrate N concentration by 21% to 45% during the incubation period while the addition of B2 (lower CEC and higher ash content) alone increased the nitrate N concentration during the first 10 days. Biochar B1 also reduced the abundance of amo A transcripts by 71% after 60 days. Compared to B1 + urea, B2 + urea resulted in a significantly greater initial increase in soil ammonium and nitrate N concentrations. However, B2 + urea had a significantly lower 60-day cumulative N 2 O emission compared to B1 + urea. Overall, when applied with urea, the biochar with higher CEC reduced ammonification and nitrification rates, while biochar with higher ash content reduced N N 2 O production. Our study demonstrated that biochar has the potential to enhance N retention in soil and reduce N 2 O emission when it is applied with urea, but the specific effects of the added biochar depend on its physical and chemical properties."
https://openalex.org/W3137764019,"Wild relatives of domesticated Capsicum represent substantial genetic diversity and thus sources of traits of potential interest. Furthermore, the hybridization compatibility between members of Capsicum species complexes remains unresolved. Improving our understanding of the relationship between Capsicum species relatedness and their ability to form hybrids is a highly pertinent issue. Through the development of novel interspecific hybrids in this study, we demonstrate interspecies compatibility is not necessarily reflected in relatedness according to established Capsicum genepool complexes. Based on a phylogeny constructed by genotyping using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and with a portion of the waxy locus, and through principal component analysis (PCA) of phenotypic data, we clarify the relationships among wild and domesticated Capsicum species. Together, the phylogeny and hybridization studies provide evidence for the misidentification of a number of species from the World Vegetable Center genebank included in this study. The World Vegetable Center holds the largest collection of Capsicum genetic material globally, therefore this may reflect a wider issue in the misidentification of Capsicum wild relatives. The findings presented here provide insight into an apparent disconnect between compatibility and relatedness in the Capsicum genus, which will be valuable in identifying candidates for future breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W3136840974,"There is a growing understanding of the role that bedrock weathering can play as a source of nitrogen (N) to soils, groundwater and river systems. The significance is particularly apparent in mountainous environments where weathering fluxes can be large. However, our understanding of the relative contributions of rock-derived, or geogenic, N to the total N supply of mountainous watersheds remains poorly understood. In this study, we develop the High-Altitude Nitrogen Suite of Models (HAN-SoMo), a watershed-scale ensemble of process-based models to quantify the relative sources, transformations, and sinks of geogenic and atmospheric N through a mountain watershed. Our study is based in the East River Watershed (ERW) in the Upper Colorado River Basin. The East River is a near-pristine headwater watershed underlain primarily by an N-rich Mancos Shale bedrock, enabling the timing and magnitude of geogenic and atmospheric contributions to watershed scale dissolved N-exports to be quantified. Several calibration scenarios were developed to explore equifinality using &gt;1600 N concentration measurements from streams, groundwater, and vadose zone samples collected over the course of four years across the watershed. When accounting for recycling of N through plant litter turnover, rock weathering accounts for approximately 12% of the annual dissolved N sources to the watershed in the most probable calibration scenario (0–31% in other scenarios), and 21% (0–44% in other scenarios) when considering only “new” N sources (i.e. geogenic and atmospheric). On an annual scale, instream dissolved N elimination, plant turnover (including cattle grazing) and atmospheric deposition are the most important controls on N cycling."

We found that in adult mice, Meflin -expressing lineage cells were present in adipose tissue stroma and had differentiated into mature adipocytes. These cells constituted Crown-like structures in the adipose tissue of mice after high-fat diet loading.

Weather and seasonal effects were analyzed using a single linear regression model with age, sex, motion, scan sequence, time-of-day, month of the year, and the deviation from average barometric pressure, air temperature, and humidity, as covariates. FDR correction for multiple comparisons was applied to groups of non-overlapping ROIs. Significant negative relationships were found between the left- and right- cerebellum cortex and pressure (t = -2.25, p = 0.049; t = -2.771, p = 0.017). Significant positive relationships were found between left- and right- cerebellum cortex and white matter between the comparisons of January/June and January/September. Significant negative relationships were found between several subcortical ROIs for the summer months compared to January. An opposing effect was observed between the supra- and infra-tentorium, with opposite effect directions in winter and summer. Cohen’s d effect sizes from monthly comparisons were similar to those reported in recent psychiatric big-data publications, raising the possibility that seasonal changes and weather may be confounds in large cohort studies. Additionally, changes in brain volume due to natural environmental variation have not been reported before and may have implications for weather-related and seasonal ailments."
https://openalex.org/W3126410773,"Background We sought to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Tele-HF Clinic (Tele-HFC) program on cardiovascular death, heart failure (HF) rehospitalization, and heart transplantation rates in a cohort of ambulatory HF patients during and after the peak of the pandemic. Methods Using the HF clinic database, we compared data of patients with HF before, during, and after the peak of the pandemic (January 1 to March 17 [pre-COVID], March 17 to May 31 [peak-COVID], and June 1 to October 1 [post-COVID]). During peak-COVID, all patients were managed by Tele-HFC or hospitalization. After June 1, patients chose either a face-to-face clinic visit or a continuous tele-clinic visit. Results Cardiovascular death and medical titration rates were similar in peak-COVID compared with all other periods. HF readmission rates were significantly lower in peak-COVID (8.7% vs. 2.5%, p&lt;0.001) and slightly increased (3.5%) post-COVID. Heart transplant rates were substantially increased in post-COVID (4.5% vs. peak-COVID [0%], p = 0.002). After June 1, 38% of patients continued with the Tele-HFC program. Patients managed by the Tele-HFC program for &lt;6 months were less likely to have HF with reduced ejection fraction (73% vs. 54%, p = 0.005) and stage-D HF (33% vs. 14%, p = 0.001), and more likely to achieve the target neurohormonal blockade dose (p&lt;0.01), compared with the ≥6-month Tele-HFC group. Conclusions HF rehospitalization and transplant rates significantly declined during the pandemic in ambulatory care of HF. However, reduction in these rates did not affect subsequent 5-month hospitalization and cardiovascular mortality in the setting of Tele-HFC program and continuum of advanced HF therapies."
https://openalex.org/W3138668709,"Interventions to shift the behaviour of consumers using unsustainable wildlife products are key to threatened species conservation. Whether these interventions are effective is largely unknown due to a dearth of detailed evaluations. We previously conducted a country-level online behaviour change intervention targeting consumers of the Critically Endangered saiga antelope ( Saiga tatarica ) horn in Singapore. To evaluate intervention impact, we carried out in-person consumer surveys with &gt;2,000 individuals pre- and post-intervention (2017 and 2019), and 93 in-person post-intervention surveys with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) shopkeepers (2019). The proportion of self-reported high-usage saiga horn consumers in the target audience (Chinese Singaporean women aged 35–59) did not change significantly from pre- to post-intervention (24.4% versus 22.6%). However, post-intervention the target audience was significantly more likely than the non-target audience to accurately recall the intervention message and to report a decrease in saiga horn usage (4% versus 1% reported a behaviour change). Within the target audience, high-usage consumers were significantly more likely than lower-usage consumers to recall the message and report a behaviour change. Across respondents who reported a decrease in saiga horn usage, they cited the intervention message as a specific reason for their behaviour change significantly more than other reasons. Additionally, across all respondents, the belief that saiga is a common species in the wild decreased significantly from pre- to post-intervention. TCM shopkeepers, however, cited factors such as price and availability as the strongest influences on saiga horn sales. In sum, the intervention did significantly influence some consumers but the reduction of high-usage consumer frequency was not significant at the population level. We explore reasons for these findings, including competing consumer influences, characteristics of the intervention, and evaluation timing. This work suggests our intervention approach has potential, and exemplifies a multi-pronged in-person evaluation of an online wildlife trade consumer intervention."
https://openalex.org/W3139488368,"Floating toe (FT) is a frequently seen condition in which a toe is inadequately in contact with the ground. Although toes play an important role in stabilizing standing posture and walking, many aspects of the effects of FT on the body remain unclear. To our knowledge, there have been no reports about the relationship between FT and postural stability, especially in children. This study aimed to clarify the prevalence of FT and its relationship with static postural stability in children. Of the 400 children aged 8 years who participated in our cohort study, 396, who were examined for static postural stability, were included in this study. Postural stability and FT were assessed using a foot pressure plate. The sway path length of the center of pressure and the area of the ellipse defined as the size of the area marked by the center of pressure, were measured as an evaluation of static postural stability. We calculated the “floating toe score (FT score: small FT score indicates insufficient ground contact of the toes)” using the image of the plantar footprint obtained at the postural stability measurement. The rate of FT was elevated at more than 90%, and the FT score in the eyes-closed condition was significantly higher than that in the eyes-open condition in both sexes. The FT score significantly correlated with the center of pressure path and area. Our results suggest that ground contact of the toes is not directly related to static postural stability in children, but it may function to stabilize the body when the condition becomes unstable, such as when the eyes are closed."

An anti-IL-7 receptor monoclonal antibody (GSK2618960) biotherapeutic was evaluated in healthy subjects for safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and immunogenicity in a single-dose escalation phase I study. We found that antibodies against GSK2618960 (i.e., anti-drug antibodies or ADA) developed in 83% and 100% of GSK2618960-treated subjects in the 0.6 and 2.0 mg/kg dose cohorts, respectively. Of the ADA positive subjects, 64% (7 of 11) had detectable neutralizing activity. Further investigation revealed the presence of GSK2618960-specific memory B cells, indicating the development of immunological memory for the ADAs. Ex vivo stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples demonstrated a relatively strong CD4+ T cell proliferation response to GSK2618960 as compared to the control anti-RSV antibody (which is known to have only low immunogenic potential), confirming the high immunogenic potential of GSK2618960. Furthermore, GSK2618960 was found to bind in vitro monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs). GSK2618960 treatment of PBMCs increased the proportion of DC cells showing an increase in expression of CD83, CD86 and CD209, which indicated enhanced DC differentiation and activation relative to the isotype control anti-β amyloid antibody. Collectively, the evidence supports that the high incidence of observed clinical immunogenicity was likely related to the receptor-mediated activity by GSK2618960."

We therefore envisioned that DksA1 inhibitors may help to control P. aeruginosa infection. Here, we screened a library of 6970 chemical compounds and identified two compounds (henceforth termed Dkstatins) that specifically suppressed DksA1 activity. Treatment with these two compounds also substantially decreased the production of elastase and pyocyanin, dominant virulence determinants of P. aeruginosa, and protected murine hosts from lethal infection from a prototype strain of P. aeruginosa, PAO1. The Dkstatins also suppressed production of homoserine lactone (HSL)-based autoinducers that activate P. aeruginosa QS. The level of 3-oxo-C12-HSL produced by Dkstatin-treated wildtype PAO1 closely resembled that of the ΔdksA1 mutant. RNA-Seq analysis showed that transcription levels of QS- and virulence-associated genes were markedly reduced in Dkstatin-treated PAO1 cells, indicating that Dkstatin-mediated suppression occurs at the transcriptional level. Importantly, Dkstatins increased the antibiotic susceptibilities of PAO1, particularly to protein synthesis inhibitors, such as tobramycin and tetracycline. Co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that these Dkstatins interfered with DksA1 binding to the β subunit of RNA polymerase, pointing to a potential mechanism of action.

Furthermore, uninterrupted production of cholera toxin and hemagglutinin protease required functional DksA (16Pal R.R. Bag S. Dasgupta S. Das B. Bhadra R.K.

Bacteriol. 2012; 194: 5638-5648Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Likewise, in Salmonella, DksA was found essential for the expression of motility, biofilm formation, cellular invasion, and intestinal colonization that caused in vivo systemic infection (17Azriel S. Goren A. Rahav G. Gal-Mor O. The stringent response regulator DksA is required for Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium growth in minimal medium, motility, biofilm formation, and intestinal colonization.Infect. Immun. 2016; 84: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Moreover, DksA in Salmonella controlled central metabolism to balance its redox state, which in turn helped resist against oxidative stress produced by antimicrobial phagocytes (18Henard C.A. Bourret T.J. Song M. Vazquez-Torres A. Control of redox balance by the stringent response regulatory protein promotes antioxidant defenses of Salmonella.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 36785-36793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). P. aeruginosa harbors five genes in its genome encoding proteins belonging to the DksA superfamily, including two that are highly homologous to the typical DksA in E. coli (12Perron K. Comte R. van Delden C. DksA represses ribosomal gene transcription in Pseudomonas aeruginosa by interacting with RNA polymerase on ribosomal promoters.Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1087-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 19Blaby-Haas C.E. Furman R. Rodionov D.A. Artsimovitch I. de Crecy-Lagard V. Role of a Zn-independent DksA in Zn homeostasis and stringent response.Mol. Microbiol. 2011; 79: 700-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Of these two DksA homologs, named DksA1 and DksA2, DksA1 is structurally and functionally similar to E. coli DksA. DksA2, on the other hand, was reported to only partially replace DksA1 functions, as it lacks the typical Zn2+-binding motif present in DksA (19Blaby-Haas C.E. Furman R. Rodionov D.A. Artsimovitch I. de Crecy-Lagard V. Role of a Zn-independent DksA in Zn homeostasis and stringent response.Mol. Microbiol. 2011; 79: 700-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, our recent study clearly suggested that DksA1, not DksA2, plays a dominant role as a suppressor of ribosomal gene expression (13Min K.B. Yoon S.S. Transcriptome analysis reveals that the RNA polymerase-binding protein DksA1 has pleiotropic functions in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 3851-3864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Importantly, a ΔdksA2 mutant exhibited almost identical phenotypes with its parental strain, PAO1, indicating that DksA2 can be dispensable. Beyond its traditional function, DksA1 was also identified to regulate a wide range of phenotypes including quorum sensing (QS)-related virulence, anaerobiosis, and motilities (13Min K.B. Yoon S.S. Transcriptome analysis reveals that the RNA polymerase-binding protein DksA1 has pleiotropic functions in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 3851-3864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Based upon these findings, we hypothesized that DksA1 may be an efficient target for inhibiting P. aeruginosa infection. In the present work, we screened a library of chemical compounds (n = 6970) and identified two molecules that effectively compromised DksA1 activity. PAO1 cells treated with each candidate compound shared much of the characteristics of the ΔdksA1 mutant, such as significant attenuation of QS-mediated virulence and elevated antibiotic susceptibility. Furthermore, QS is considered as an antivirulence target to control P. aeruginosa infection in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) (20Scoffone V.C. Trespidi G. Chiarelli L.R. Barbieri G. Buroni S. Quorum sensing as antivirulence target in cystic fibrosis pathogens.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2019; 20: 1838Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Given that QS machinery has been a target for inhibition, our results demonstrate that DksA1 can serve as a novel avenue to achieve P. aeruginosa QS inhibition. To set up a screening scheme in a high-throughput manner, we needed to find a phenotype of the ΔdksA1 mutant that can be easily and reproducibly measured. In Salmonella, it was reported that DksA modulates the redox balance in response to oxidative stress, and the NADH level decreased when the dksA gene is disrupted (18Henard C.A. Bourret T.J. Song M. Vazquez-Torres A. Control of redox balance by the stringent response regulatory protein promotes antioxidant defenses of Salmonella.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 36785-36793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether the phenotype observed in Salmonella is also detected in P. aeruginosa. NADH levels are indirectly represented by the conversion of tetrazolium salt to formazan (purple pigment), which is mediated by a NADH-dependent reductase (21Stockert J.C. Horobin R.W. Colombo L.L. Blazquez-Castro A. Tetrazolium salts and formazan products in cell biology: Viability assessment, fluorescence imaging, and labeling perspectives.Acta Histochem. 2018; 120: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In accordance with what was observed in Salmonella, the P. aeruginosa ΔdksA1 mutant produced a noticeably reduced amount of formazan (Fig. S1A). Since the formazan assay can easily be performed, we concluded that this assay can serve as an efficient screening platform, minimizing the chance of plate-to-plate variations. The library that we used was a compound library consisting of a total of 6970 chemicals that was provided by the Korean Chemical Bank. The screening was conducted in two stages. To begin with, we screened the entire library for the formazan assay to isolate candidate compounds. Then, we compared phenotypes induced in PAO1 by each candidate compound with those of the ΔdksA1 mutant (Fig. S1B). Our goal was to isolate compounds that make PAO1 behave like the ΔdksA1 mutant. In the first step, we screened out a total of 178 chemical compounds including 25 compounds that robustly reduced formazan production and 153 mild reducers. In a repetitive formazan assay using these 153 mild reducers, we selected another set of 25 compounds that exhibited relatively strong activities in reducing formazan production. Consequently, a total of 50 compounds were selected in the first stage (Fig. S1B). It was previously reported that transcription of genes encoding ribosomal proteins is highly activated in the ΔdksA1 mutant (12Perron K. Comte R. van Delden C. DksA represses ribosomal gene transcription in Pseudomonas aeruginosa by interacting with RNA polymerase on ribosomal promoters.Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1087-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 13Min K.B. Yoon S.S.

Chem. 2020; 295: 3851-3864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We postulated that these marked changes at the transcriptional levels may allow us to verify the phenotypes induced by candidate compounds. We therefore constructed a reporter P. aeruginosa strain by chromosomally integrating an rpsB gene promoter fused with lacZ ORF (PrpsB::lacZ). The rpsB gene codes for 30S ribosomal protein S2. In our previous work, we also reported that the production of elastase, a dominant virulence determinant and an easily measurable phenotype, is highly suppressed in the ΔdksA1 mutant (13Min K.B. Yoon S.S. Transcriptome analysis reveals that the RNA polymerase-binding protein DksA1 has pleiotropic functions in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 3851-3864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Therefore, we also assessed elastase production as a second-stage verification. By successive β-galactosidase and elastase activity assays, we finally nominated a total of four chemicals, 55B05, 02G09, 86B09, and 45G08, as a set of final candidates. We then monitored these two phenotypes in diverse cultivation conditions and at different time points to finally select chemicals that yield consistent results. While reduced elastase production and elevated rpsB transcription were observed at 4 h postinoculation by all four chemicals at a 50 μM concentration, the effects of 02G09 and 45G08 did not last for the extended period of incubation (Fig. S2, A and B). At 8 h postinoculation, the levels of elastase produced in 02G09-or 45G08-treated PAO1 were almost identical to that of PAO1 (Fig. S2B). Thus, 55B05 and 86B09 were finally selected as DksA1 inhibitors, and we referred to these as Dkstatin-1 (DKST-1) and Dkstatin-2 (DKST-2). The Korean Chemical Bank database provides the structures of DKST-1 and DKST-2, and they were found to have distinct chemical structures (Fig. 1, A and B). To further confirm that Dkstatin (DKST) molecules act specifically against DksA1 activity, formazan production and rpsB reporter expression were measured in PAO1 and the ΔdksA1 mutant as well. Hereafter, DKST-1 and -2 were used at 150 μM concentrations in all experiments. Again, levels of formazan production in PAO1 were noticeably reduced in the presence of DKST treatment (Fig. 1C). It is of interest that formazan production in PAO1 treated with 150 μM DKST-1 was even lower than that of the ΔdksA1 mutant. On the other hand, levels of formazan production in the ΔdksA1 mutant were not further decreased by either DKST compound (Fig. 1C). Likewise, DKST-1 and DKST-2 did not further increase the rpsB gene transcription in the ΔdksA1 mutant (Fig. 1D). As DKST-1 and DKST-2 were identified to inhibit DksA1 activity, no apparent effects of DKSTs were present in a strain devoid of dksA1 gene. These results suggest that Dkstatin compounds selectively inhibit DksA1 activity. DksA1 plays versatile roles at the transcriptional level affecting various phenotypes (13Min K.B. Yoon S.S. Transcriptome analysis reveals that the RNA polymerase-binding protein DksA1 has pleiotropic functions in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 3851-3864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Therefore, DKST molecules inhibiting the activity of DksA1 may induce diverse physiological changes in P. aeruginosa. To identify whether DKSTs affect the growth of PAO1, we conducted growth curve experiments of PAO1 in the presence of 150 μM of DKSTs. Control growth curves were obtained by adding equal volume of DMSO used as a solvent. In comparison with PAO1 and ΔdksA1 mutant, PAO1 growth never changed upon DKST-1 supplementation (Fig. 2A). To our surprise, a noticeable increase CFU/ml values in PAO1 growth was repeatedly observed at exponential phase when treated with DKST-2 (Fig. 2A). When CFU was enumerated 8 h postinoculation, no obvious growth enhancement was observed (Fig. 2B). Together, these two sets of results indicate that DKST-1 and -2 at least do not downregulate bacterial growth and viability. At a concentration of 150 μM, DKST-2 suppressed elastase production to a more significant degree (Fig. 2C). Under DKST-2-treated conditions, the level of elastase production was less than 40% of what control PAO1 cells produced. Elastase production in PAO1 treated with 150 μM DKST-1 was approximately 65% of the control level. Along with elastase, pyocyanin is another crucial virulence determinant whose production is also controlled by QS in P. aeruginosa (2Valentini M. Gonzalez D. Mavridou D.A. Filloux A. Lifestyle transitions and adaptive pathogenesis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2018; 41: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 22Jiang Q. Chen J. Yang C. Yin Y. Yao K.

The hierarchy quorum sensing network in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Protein Cell. 2015; 6: 26-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). When we measured the pyocyanin production, a marked reduction was observed in DKST-treated PAO1 (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, the degree of reduction by either DKST molecule in PAO1 was comparable to that induced by the dksA1 gene deletion (Fig. 2D). The loss of pyocyanin production was clearly represented in the image of culture supernatants shown in Figure 2E. In P. aeruginosa, QS is operated by small organic molecules, termed autoinducers (24Lee K.M. Yoon M.Y. Park Y. Lee J.H. Yoon S.S. Anaerobiosis-induced loss of cytotoxicity is due to inactivation of quorum sensing in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Infect. Immun. 2011; 79: 2792-2800Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Since major QS-mediated phenotypes were suppressed in DKST-treated PAO1 and in the ΔdksA1 mutant, we monitored how many autoinducers were produced in response to the DKST treatment. Two homoserine lactone (HSL) autoinducers, 3-oxo-C12-HSL and C4-HSL, were semiquantitatively measured as described in the Methods section. Based on our quantification, levels of 3-oxo-C12-HSL produced in either DKST-1 or DKST-2-treated PAO1 cells were almost identical to that in the ΔdksA1 mutant (Fig. 3A). Similarly, levels of C4-HSL produced upon treatment with either DKST were noticeably decreased to 53% and 63% of what was detected in the control group, respectively (Fig. 3B). When DKST-treated PAO1 cells were cotreated with extraneous C4-HSL and 3-oxo-C12-HSL, elastase production was restored (Fig. S3). Elastase production was almost completely recovered following 4 h autoinducer complementation, while the complementation effects diminished thereafter (Fig. S3). These results demonstrate that the LasI-R and RhlI-R QS circuits can be substantially impaired by two DKSTs, with the LasI-R system being suppressed almost to the degree of the ΔdksA1 mutant. Furthermore, our results indicate that DKST-induced virulence attenuation occurred at the level of the HSL-based autoinducer production. The transcription of genes involved in denitrification or anaerobic respiration requires DksA1 activity (13Min K.B. Yoon S.S. Transcriptome analysis reveals that the RNA polymerase-binding protein DksA1 has pleiotropic functions in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 3851-3864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether the DKST compounds also have an impact on anaerobic respiratory growth of P. aeruginosa. We tested bacterial growth using NO3− as an alternative electron acceptor. When cells were grown anaerobically with 25 mM NO3−, PAO1 strains reached an average OD600 value of ∼1.6 in 24 h (Fig. 4A). In contrast, final OD600 values plateaued at ∼1.24 in the ΔdksA1 mutant under the same conditions. Under the DKST-1 supplemented growth conditions, PAO1 grew up to OD600 values of ∼1.18, similar to the growth of a ΔdksA1 mutant. Likewise, average OD600 values were ∼1.27 in the presence of DKST-2 (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, the growth stimulating effect of DKST-2 (Fig. 2A) observed during aerobic growth was not detected under anaerobic respiration. In a CFU counting assay, we observed that the addition of DKST-2 resulted in a similar outcome as the ΔdksA1 mutant (Fig. 4B). Around tenfold decreases in viable cell numbers were observed at the end of the growth experiments both in PAO1 treated with DKST-2 and in the ΔdksA1 mutant, whereas a significant difference in cell numbers was not detected when DKST-1 was supplemented. Together, these results illustrate that DKST compounds are involved in suppression of major anaerobic respiration pathways in P. aeruginosa, although the degree of impact varies between the two DKSTs. P. aeruginosa is notorious for its antibiotic resistance (1Moradali M.F. Ghods S. Rehm B.H. Pseudomonas aeruginosa lifestyle: A paradigm for adaptation, survival, and persistence.Front. Cell. Infect. Microbiol. 2017; 7: 39Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). As an opportunistic pathogen, it has also acquired resistance to multiple drugs (1Moradali M.F. Ghods S. Rehm B.H.

Prognostic scores at admission in tertiary services may improve early identification of severity and better allocation of resources, ultimately improving survival. Herein, we aimed at evaluating prognostic biomarkers of CAP and a Pneumonia-Optimized Ratio was created to improve prognostic performance.In this retrospective study, all patients with suspected Community-acquired pneumonia aged 18 or older admitted to a public hospital from January 2019 to February 2020 were included in this study. Blood testing and clinical information at admission were collected, and the primary outcome was overall survival. CURB-65 scores and prognostic biomarkers were measured, namely Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Cell Ratio (NLCR), Platelet to Lymphocyte ratio (PLR), Monocyte to Lymphocyte Ratio (MLR). A Pneumonia-Optimized Ratio (POR) score was created by selecting the biomarker with larger accuracy (NLCR) and multiplying it by the patients' CURB-65 score. Multivariate regression model was performed and ROC curves were created for each biomarker.Our sample consisted of 646 individuals (median 66 years [IQR, 18-103], 53.9% females) with complete blood testing at the time of admission. Patients scored 0-1 (323, 50%), 2 (187, 28.9%), or 3 or above (122, 18.9%) in the CURB-65, and 65 (10%) presented the primary outcome of death. POR exhibited the highest Area Under Curve (AUC) in the ROC analysis (AUC = 0.753), when compared with NLCR (AUC = 0.706), PLR (AUC = 0.630) and MLR (AUC = 0.627). POR and NLCR presented increased crude mortality rate in the fourth quartile in comparison with the first quartile, and the fourth quartile of NLCR had more days of hospitalization than the first quartile (11.06±15.96 vs. 7.02±8.39, p = 0.012).The Pneumonia-Optimized Ratio in patients with CAP showed good prognostic performance of mortality at the admission of a tertiary service. The NLCR may also be used as an estimation of days of hospitalization. Prognostic biomarkers may provide important guidance to resource allocation in resource-limited settings."

According to the existing problems in current leather cutting systems, a Fault Diagnosis (FD) method combining Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) of Gray Wolf Optimizer (GWO) is proposed. This method first converts the original signal into a scale spectrogram and then selects the pre-trained CNN model, AlexNet, to extract the signal scale spectrogram’s features. Next, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces the obtained feature’s dimensionality. Finally, the normalized data are input into GWO’s SVM classifier to diagnose the bearing’s faults. Results demonstrate that the proposed model has higher cutting accuracy than the latest fault detection models. After model optimization, when c is 25 and g is 0.2, the model accuracy can reach 99.24%, an increase of 66.96% compared with traditional fault detection models. The research results can provide ideas and practical references for improving leather cutting enterprises’ process flow."

The shell is filled with the capric acid Phase Change Material (PCM) and absorbs the heat from a hot U-tube petal. The governing equations for the natural convection flow of molten PCM and phase change heat transfer were introduced by using the enthalpy-porosity approach. An automatic adaptive mesh scheme was used to track the melting interface. The accuracy and convergence of numerical computations were also controlled by a free step Backward Differentiation Formula. The modeling results were compared with previous experimental data. It was found that the present adaptive mesh approach can adequately the melting heat transfer, and an excellent agreement was found with available literature. The effect of geometrical designs of the petal tube was investigated on the melting response of the thermal energy storage unit. The phase change behavior was analyzed by using temperature distribution contours. The results showed that petal tubes could notably increase the melting rate in the TES unit compared to a typical circular tube. Besides, the more the petal numbers, the better the heat transfer. Using a petal tube could increase the charging power by 44% compared to a circular tube. The placement angle of the tubes is another important design factor which should be selected carefully. For instance, vertical placement of tubes could improve the charging power by 300% compared to a case with the tubes’ horizontal placement."

The time horizon was 30 years and the analysis was conducted from an English National Health Service (NHS) and Personal Social Services perspective. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to account for uncertainties in the model parameters.Outcomes for the entire simulated period included the following: total costs for PROMPT or shoulder dystocia training (including costs of OBPIs), number of OBPIs averted, number of affected adult/parental/dyadic quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and the incremental cost per QALY gained.Nationwide PROMPT or shoulder dystocia training conferred significant savings (in excess of £1 billion ($1.5 billion)) compared to current practice, resulting in cost-savings of at least £1 million ($1.5 million) per any type of QALY gained. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated similar findings.In this model, national implementation of multi-professional simulation training for obstetric emergencies (or standalone shoulder dystocia training) in England appeared to both be cost-saving when evaluating their impact on permanent OBPIs."
https://openalex.org/W3136793433,"A synthetic lethal effect arises when a cancer-associated change introduces a unique vulnerability to cancer cells that makes them unusually susceptible to a drug’s inhibitory activity. The synthetic lethal approach is attractive because it enables targeting of cancers harboring specific genomic or epigenomic alterations, the products of which may have proven refractory to direct targeting. An example is cancer driven by overexpression of MYC. Here, we conducted a high-content screen for compounds that are synthetic lethal to elevated MYC using a small-molecule library to identify compounds that are closely related to, or are themselves, regulatory-approved drugs. The screen identified dimethylfasudil, a potent and reversible inhibitor of Rho-associated kinases, ROCK1 and ROCK2. Close analogs of dimethylfasudil are used clinically to treat neurologic and cardiovascular disorders. The synthetic lethal interaction was conserved in rodent and human cell lines and could be observed with activation of either MYC or its paralog MYCN. The synthetic lethality seems specific to MYC overexpressing cells as it could not be substituted by a variety of oncogenic manipulations and synthetic lethality was diminished by RNAi-mediated depletion of MYC in human cancer cell lines. Collectively, these data support investigation of the use of dimethylfasudil as a drug that is synthetic lethal for malignancies that specifically overexpress MYC."

The UK Difficult Airway Society [DAS] has directed all Anaesthetists to be trained with surgical cricothyroidotomy [SCT] as the primary emergency FONA method, sometimes referred to as 'Cric' as a shorthand. We present a longitudinal analysis using a classical approach to Grounded Theory methodology of ten Specialist Trainee Anaesthetists' data during a 6-month training programme delivered jointly by Anaesthetists and Surgeons. We identified with a critical realist ontology and an objectivist epistemology meaning data interpretation was driven by participants' narratives and accepted as true accounts of their experience. Our theory comprises three themes: 'Identity as an Anaesthetist'; 'The Role of a Temporary Surgeon'; and 'Training to Reconcile Identities', whereby training facilitated the psychological transition from a 'bloodless Doctor' (Anaesthetist) to becoming a 'temporary Surgeon'. The training programme enabled Specialist Trainees to move between the role of control and responsibility (Identity as an Anaesthetist), through self-described 'failure' and into a role of uncertainty about one's own confidence and competence (The Role of a Temporary Surgeon), and then return to the Anaesthetist's role once the airway had been established. Understanding the complexity of an intervention and providing a better insight into the training needs of Anaesthetic trainees, via a Grounded Theory approach, allows us to evaluate training programmes against the recognised technical and non-technical needs of those being trained."
https://openalex.org/W3138947262,"In this paper we apply a gravity framework to user-generated data of a large online housing market platform. We show that gravity describes the patterns of inflow and outflow of hits (mouse clicks, etc.) from one municipality to another, where the municipality of the user defines the origin and the municipality of the property that is viewed defines the destination. By distinguishing serious searchers from recreational searchers we demonstrate that the gravity framework describes geographic search patterns of both types of users. The results indicate that recreational search is centered more around the user’s location than serious search. However, this finding is driven entirely by differences in border effects as there is no difference in the distance effect. By demonstrating that geographic search patterns of both serious and recreational searchers are explained by their physical locations, we present clear evidence that physical location is an important determinant of economic behavior in the virtual realm too."
https://openalex.org/W3136725994,"The objective of this study was to investigate (i) whether childhood family SES predicts offspring’s compassion between ages 20–50 years and (ii) whether adulthood SES predicts compassion or vice versa. We used the prospective population-based Young Finns data ( N = 637–2300). Childhood family SES was evaluated in 1980; participants’ adulthood SES in 2001 and 2011; and compassion for others in 1997, 2001, and 2012. Compassion for others was evaluated with the Compassion scale of the Temperament and Character Inventory. The results showed that high childhood family SES (a composite score of educational level, occupational status, unemployment status, and level of income) predicted offspring’s higher compassion between ages 30–40 years but not in early adulthood or middle age. These results were obtained independently of a variety of potential confounders (disruptive behavior in childhood; parental mental disorder; frequency of parental alcohol use and alcohol intoxication). Moreover, high compassion for others in adulthood (a composite score of educational level, occupational status, and unemployment status) predicted higher adulthood SES later in their life (after a 10-year follow-up), but not vice versa. In conclusion, favorable socioeconomic environment in childhood appears to have a positive effect on offspring’s compassion in their middle adulthood. This effect may attenuate by middle age. High compassion for others seems to promote the achievement of higher SES in adulthood."

An example of this is Chionaster nivalis , a unicellular fungus that is morphologically enigmatic and frequently observed in snow communities globally. Despite being described over one hundred years ago, the phylogeny and higher-level taxonomic classifications of C . nivalis remain unknown. Here, we isolated and sequenced the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and the D1-D2 region of the large subunit ribosomal RNA gene of C . nivalis , providing a molecular barcode for future studies. Phylogenetic analyses using the ITS and D1-D2 region revealed that C . nivalis is part of a novel lineage in the class Tremellomycetes (Basidiomycota, Agaricomycotina) for which a new order Chionasterales ord. nov. (MB838717) and family Chionasteraceae fam. nov. (MB838718) are proposed. Comparisons between C . nivalis and sequences generated from environmental surveys revealed that the Chionasterales are globally distributed and probably psychrophilic, as they appear to be limited to the high alpine and arctic regions. These results highlight the unexplored diversity that exists within these extreme habitats and emphasize the utility of single-cell approaches in characterizing these complex algal-dominated communities."
https://openalex.org/W3034392606,"Human mortality is in part a function of multiple socioeconomic factors that differ both spatially and temporally. Adjusting for other covariates, the human lifespan is positively associated with household wealth. However, the extent to which mortality in a geographical region is a function of socioeconomic factors in both that region and its neighbors is unclear. There is also little information on the temporal components of this relationship. Using the districts of Hong Kong over multiple census years as a case study, we demonstrate that there are differences in how wealth indicator variables are associated with longevity in (a) areas that are affluent but neighbored by socially deprived districts versus (b) wealthy areas surrounded by similarly wealthy districts. We also show that the inclusion of spatially-distributed variables reduces uncertainty in mortality rate predictions in each census year when compared with a baseline model. Our results suggest that geographic mortality models should incorporate nonlocal information (e.g., spatial neighbors) to lower the variance of their mortality estimates, and point to a more in-depth analysis of sociospatial spillover effects on mortality rates."
https://openalex.org/W3135972631,"Groups have access to more diverse information and typically outperform individuals on problem solving tasks. Crowdsolving utilises this principle to generate novel and/or superior solutions to intellective tasks by pooling the inputs from a distributed online crowd. However, it is unclear whether this particular instance of ""wisdom of the crowd"" can overcome the influence of potent cognitive biases that habitually lead individuals to commit reasoning errors. We empirically test the prevalence of cognitive bias on a popular crowdsourcing platform, examining susceptibility to bias of online panels at the individual and aggregate levels. We then investigate the use of the Cognitive Reflection Test, notable for its predictive validity for both susceptibility to cognitive biases in test settings and real-life reasoning, as a screening tool to improve collective performance. We find that systematic biases in crowdsourced answers are not as prevalent as anticipated, but when they occur, biases are amplified with increasing group size, as predicted by the Condorcet Jury Theorem. The results further suggest that pre-screening individuals with the Cognitive Reflection Test can substantially enhance collective judgement and improve crowdsolving performance."
https://openalex.org/W3138224076,"Introduction In Ethiopia, cataract surgery is mainly provided by donors free of charge through outreach programs. Assessing willingness to pay for patients for cataract surgery will help explain how the service is valued by the beneficiaries and design a domestic source of finance to sustain a program. Although knowledge concerning willingness to pay for cataract surgery is substantive for developing a cost-recovery model, the existed knowledge is limited and not well-addressed. Therefore, the study aimed to assess willingness to pay for cataract surgery and associated factors among cataract patients in Outreach Site, North West Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectional outreach-based study was conducted on 827 cataract patients selected through a simple random sampling method in Tebebe Gion Specialized Hospital, North West Ethiopia, from 10/11/2018 to 14/11/2018. The data were collected using a contingent valuation elicitation approach to elicit the participants’ maximum willingness to pay through face to face questionnaire interviews. The descriptive data were organized and presented using summary statistics, frequency distribution tables, and figures accordingly. Factors assumed to be associate with a willingness to pay were identified using a Tobit regression model with a p-value of &lt;0.05 and confidence interval (CI ≠ 0). Results The study involved 827 cataract patients, and their median age was 65years. About 55% of the participants were willing to pay for the surgery. The average amount of money willing to pay was 17.5USD (95% CI; 10.5, 35.00) and It was significantly associated with being still worker (β = 26.66, 95% CI: 13.03, 40.29), being educated (β = 29.16, 95% CI: 2.35, 55.97), free from ocular morbidity (β = 28.48, 95% CI: 1.08, 55.90), duration with the condition, (β = -1.69, 95% CI: -3.32, -0.07), admission laterality (β = 21.21, 95% CI: 3.65, 38.77) and remained visual ability (β = -0.29, 95% CI (-0.55, -0.04). Conclusions Participants’ willingness to pay for cataract surgery in outreach Sites is much lower than the surgery’s actual cost. Early intervention and developing a cost-recovery model with multi-tiered packages attributed to the neediest people as in retired, less educated, severely disabled is strategic to increase the demand for service uptake and service accessibility."
