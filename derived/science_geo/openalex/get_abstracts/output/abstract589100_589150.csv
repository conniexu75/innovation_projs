We analyzed 363 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases by whole-exome sequencing and DNA copy number analyses, and we analyzed 196 HCC cases by DNA methylation, RNA, miRNA, and proteomic expression also. DNA sequencing and mutation analysis identified significantly mutated genes, including LZTR1, EEF1A1, SF3B1, and SMARCA4. Significant alterations by mutation or downregulation by hypermethylation in genes likely to result in HCC metabolic reprogramming (ALB, APOB, and CPS1) were observed.

Liver cancer is the second most common cause of death from cancer worldwide, with 700,000 annual deaths recorded globally in recent years (Ferlay et al., 2015Ferlay J. Soerjomataram I. Dikshit R. Eser S. Mathers C. Rebelo M. Parkin D.M. Forman D. Bray F. Cancer incidence and mortality worldwide: sources, methods and major patterns in GLOBOCAN 2012.Int. J. Cancer. 2015; 136: E359-E386Crossref PubMed Scopus (21251) Google Scholar). Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the predominant form of liver cancer, has several known risk factors, including chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, alcohol abuse, autoimmune hepatitis, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and several metabolic diseases. In developed nations, there has been a rise in HCC incidence partly attributed to HCV, obesity, and diabetes (Yang and Roberts, 2010Yang J.D. Roberts L.R. Hepatocellular carcinoma: A global view.Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2010; 7: 448-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). The liver injury induced by these risk factors produces a progressive inflammatory milieu that results in a cycle of necrosis and regeneration and the development of chromosomal instability (Karagozian et al., 2014Karagozian R. Derdák Z. Baffy G. Obesity-associated mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis.Metabolism. 2014; 63: 607-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Genetic and epigenetic alterations that progressively accumulate in a background of increased reactive oxygen species, inflammatory cytokines, and fibrosis likely lead to the initiation of HCC (Dhanasekaran et al., 2016Dhanasekaran R. Bandoh S. Roberts L.R. Molecular pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma and impact of therapeutic advances.F1000Res. 2016; 5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Initiation and progression of HCC is considered a multi-step process, but the precise molecular events that underlie HCC formation remain only partially understood (Zucman-Rossi et al., 2015Zucman-Rossi J. Villanueva A. Nault J.C. Llovet J.M. Genetic landscape and biomarkers of hepatocellular carcinoma.Gastroenterology. 2015; 149: 1226-1239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Recent studies have explored HCC genomic alterations and have identified frequently mutated genes, including TERT promoter, TP53, and CTNNB1 (β-catenin) (Schulze et al., 2015Schulze K. Imbeaud S. Letouzé E. Alexandrov L.B. Calderaro J. Rebouissou S. Couchy G. Meiller C. Shinde J.

Nakamura H. et al.Trans-ancestry mutational landscape of hepatocellular carcinoma genomes.Nat. Genet. 2014; 46: 1267-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Despite many potential therapeutic targets, sorafenib and regorafenib, related multikinase inhibitors, are currently the only drug approved for advanced HCC management (Llovet et al., 2008Llovet J.M. Ricci S. Mazzaferro V. Hilgard P. Gane E. Blanc J.F. de Oliveira A.C. Santoro A. Raoul J.L. Forner A. et al.SHARP Investigators Study GroupSorafenib in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.N. Engl. J. Med. 2008; 359: 378-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (8967) Google Scholar). More than ten drugs have failed to meet clinical end points in phase III trials, indicating a need for new drug discovery for HCC (Llovet and Hernandez-Gea, 2014Llovet J.M. Hernandez-Gea V. Hepatocellular carcinoma: reasons for phase III failure and novel perspectives on trial design.Clin. Cancer Res. 2014; 20: 2072-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). As part of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) network, we have performed the first large-scale multi-platform analysis of HCC, including evaluation of somatic mutations and DNA copy number in 363 patients and examination of DNA methylation, mRNA expression, microRNA (miRNA) expression, and protein expression in 196 patients to understand the molecular landscape of HCCs (Tables S1A–S1C). Tissue and tumor specimens were obtained from patients with appropriate consent from institutional review boards under the guidelines of The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network.' The integrated analyses of multiple data platforms in conjunction with clinical data (Tables S1A and S1B) has facilitated biological insights, identification of therapeutic targets, and the characterization of robust subclasses with prognostic implications that may influence HCC clinical management. Whole-exome sequencing was performed on 363 HCC cases for a mean coverage of 95% of targeted bases with a minimum of 20-fold coverage. In total, 12,136 genes had non-silent mutations, and 26 genes were determined to be significantly mutated genes (SMGs) by the MutSigCV algorithm (Lawrence et al., 2014Lawrence M.S. Stojanov P. Mermel C.H. Robinson J.T. Garraway L.A. Golub T.R. Meyerson M. Gabriel S.B. Lander E.S. Getz G. Discovery and saturation analysis of cancer genes across 21 tumour types.Nature. 2014; 505: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar) (Figure 1, Tables S2A and S2B, STAR Methods). Of these 26 genes, 18 were reported as SMGs in at least one previous HCC genome sequencing study (Table S2B). These included the tumor suppressor genes TP53 (31%), AXIN1 (8%), and RB1 (4%) that were inactivated by mutation, the WNT pathway oncogene CTNNB1 (27%), and the chromatin remodeling genes ARID1A (7%), ARID2 (5%), and BAP1 (5%) (Figure 1, Tables S2A and S2B). NFE2L2 and its interactor KEAP1, important in cellular anti-oxidant defenses, were significantly mutated in 3% and 5% of HCC, respectively. Albumin (ALB) and APOB mutations were observed in 13% and 10% of tumors, consistent with previous HCC sequencing studies (Figure 1, Table S2B) (Fujimoto et al., 2016Fujimoto A. Furuta M. Totoki Y. Tsunoda T. Kato M. Shiraishi Y. Tanaka H. Taniguchi H. Kawakami Y. Ueno M. et al.Whole-genome mutational landscape and characterization of noncoding and structural mutations in liver cancer.Nat.

Soysouvanh F. et al.Exome sequencing of hepatocellular carcinomas identifies new mutational signatures and potential therapeutic targets.Nat. Genet. 2015; 47: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). ALB and APOB RNA expression were decreased in HCC relative to normal tissues. HCC stratified by low ALB and APOB expression were associated by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) with increased cell cycle progression, ribosome biogenesis and nucleotide synthesis, and reduced oxidative phosphorylation (data not shown). Because ALB expression accounts for 20% of cellular mRNA (Uhlén et al., 2015Uhlén M. Fagerberg L. Hallström B.M. Lindskog C. Oksvold P. Mardinoglu A. Sivertsson Å. Kampf C. Sjöstedt E. Asplund A. et al.Proteomics. Tissue-based map of the human proteome.Science. 2015; 347: 1260419Crossref PubMed Scopus (7243) Google Scholar) and APOB consumes large amounts of cellular energy by facilitating VLDL secretion (Egusa et al., 1985Egusa G. Beltz W.F. Grundy S.M. Howard B.V. Influence of obesity on the metabolism of apolipoprotein B in humans.J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 596-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), there may be selection for ALB or APOB inactivating mutations to divert energy into cancer-relevant metabolic pathways (Fernandez-Banet et al., 2014Fernandez-Banet J. Lee N.P. Chan K.T. Gao H. Liu X. Sung W.K. Tan W. Fan S.T. Poon R.T. Li S. et al.Decoding complex patterns of genomic rearrangement in hepatocellular carcinoma.Genomics. 2014; 103: 189-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Among the 26 MutSigCV-identified SMGs were eight genes not previously considered candidate HCC drivers (Table S2B). LZTR1, encoding an adaptor of CUL3-containing E3 ligase complexes, was mutated in 10 of 377 HCC (3%). Eight LZTR1 mutations were inactivating splice-site mutations at codon 217, a mutation observed in adrenocortical and pancreatic cancers (Witkiewicz et al., 2015Witkiewicz A.K. McMillan E.A. Balaji U. Baek G. Lin W.C. Mansour J. Mollaee M. Wagner K.U. Koduru P. Yopp A. et al.Whole-exome sequencing of pancreatic cancer defines genetic diversity and therapeutic targets.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 6744Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). LZTR1 germline mutations have been associated with inherited segmental schwannomatosis, and somatic LTZR1 mutations are identified as driver mutations in glioblastoma (Frattini et al., 2013Frattini V. Trifonov V. Chan J.M. Castano A. Lia M. Abate F. Keir S.T. Ji A.X. Zoppoli P. Niola F. et al.The integrated landscape of driver genomic alterations in glioblastoma.Nat.

Armstrong L. et al.Germline loss-of-function mutations in LZTR1 predispose to an inherited disorder of multiple schwannomas.Nat. Genet. 2014; 46: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The translation elongation factor gene EEF1A1 was significantly mutated in ten tumors and five tumors contained S432I/S mutations, a codon mutation observed in HCC and other cancers (Ahn et al., 2014Ahn S.M. Jang S.J. Shim J.H. Kim D. Hong S.M. Sung C.O. Baek D. Haq F. Ansari A.A. Lee S.Y. et al.Genomic portrait of resectable hepatocellular carcinomas: implications of RB1 and FGF19 aberrations for patient stratification.Hepatology. 2014; 60: 1972-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Other genes identified as significantly mutated by MutSigCV included AZIN1, RP1L1, GPATCH4, CREB3L3, AHCTF1, and HIST1H1C. None of these six genes have been reported as drivers in HCC or other cancers. In addition to algorithmically curated SMGs, we manually curated two genes with MutSigCV q values close to 0.1 as likely driver genes due to recurrent mutations. SF3B1, a splicing factor gene, was mutated in ten patients, with mutations in codons N626 and K666 occurring twice each in our HCC tumor set and 11 and 21 times, respectively, across other tumor studies (Cerami et al., 2012Cerami E. Gao J. Dogrusoz U. Gross B.E. Sumer S.O. Aksoy B.A. Jacobsen A. Byrne C.J. Heuer M.L. Larsson E. et al.The cBio cancer genomics portal: an open platform for exploring multidimensional cancer genomics data.Cancer Discov. 2012; 2: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (9402) Google Scholar). SF3B1 mutations have been reported as likely driver mutations in hematopoietic malignancies (Bonnal et al., 2012Bonnal S. Vigevani L. Valcárcel J. The spliceosome as a target of novel antitumour drugs.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2012; 11: 847-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). SMARCA4, encoding a chromatin modifier of the SWI/SNF family, was mutated in 11 HCC patient tumors. Mutations at codons 1,160 and 1,192 occurred twice and were observed at this codon in 6 and 14 other non-HCC tumors, respectively (Cerami et al., 2012Cerami E. Gao J. Dogrusoz U. Gross B.E. Sumer S.O. Aksoy B.A. Jacobsen A. Byrne C.J. Heuer M.L. Larsson E. et al.The cBio cancer genomics portal: an open platform for exploring multidimensional cancer genomics data.Cancer Discov. 2012; 2: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (9402) Google Scholar). Mutations in SMARCA4 have been observed in some cancer types, including 4 of 36 HCC cases (Endo et al., 2013Endo M. Yasui K. Zen Y. Gen Y. Zen K. Tsuji K. Dohi O. Mitsuyoshi H. Tanaka S. Taniwaki M. et al.Alterations of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling subunit-BRG1 and BRM in hepatocellular carcinoma.Liver Int. 2013; 33: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). TERT promoter mutations were the most common somatic mutation, found in 87 of 196 (44%) HCCs analyzed in the TERT promoter region (Figure S1A, Table S3). Two independent TERT promoter mutations—chr5, 1,295,228 G>A (C228T) and 1,295,250 G>A (C250T)—were found, consistent with activating mutations previously reported (Horn et al., 2013Horn S. Figl A. Rachakonda P.S. Fischer C. Sucker A. Gast A. Kadel S. Moll I. Nagore E. Hemminki K. et al.TERT promoter mutations in familial and sporadic melanoma.Science. 2013; 339: 959-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). Further analysis revealed a germline TERT promoter mutation (C228T) in the blood and tumor of an HBV-positive 29-year-old Asian male with no recorded family history of HCC. Germline TERT mutations (1,295,161 T>G at the transcription start site) were associated with familial melanoma (Horn et al., 2013Horn S. Figl A. Rachakonda P.S. Fischer C. Sucker A. Gast A. Kadel S. Moll I. Nagore E. Hemminki K. et al.TERT promoter mutations in familial and sporadic melanoma.Science. 2013; 339: 959-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar), but a germline mutation at position C228T has not been reported. Patients with a TERT promoter mutation were older (p = 0.0006), predominantly male (p = 0.006), more likely to be HCV positive (p = 0.04), and less likely to be HBV positive (p = 0.02) than patients without the mutation. Molecular correlates of TERT promoter mutation included a strong co-occurrence with CDKN2A silencing by promoter hypermethylation (p = 8.1 × 10−5) (Figure S1A). CDKN2A encodes the tumor suppressor p16INK4A, and downregulation of p16INK4A expression in conjunction with enhanced TERT expression has been shown to be essential for epithelial cell immortalization, a cancer hallmark (Kiyono et al., 1998Kiyono T. Foster S.A. Koop J.I. McDougall J.K. Galloway D.A. Klingelhutz A.J. Both Rb/p16INK4a inactivation and telomerase activity are required to immortalize human epithelial cells.Nature. 1998; 396: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). TERT RNA was significantly upregulated in the HCC cohort overall (p < 0.001), but TERT promoter mutation did not significantly correlate with increased TERT RNA expression. We performed mutational signature analysis on the core set of 196 HCC applying a Bayesian variant of the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm (Tan and Févotte, 2013Tan V.Y. Févotte C. Automatic relevance determination in nonnegative matrix factorization with the β-divergence.IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal. Mach. Intell. 2013; 35: 1592-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) to mutation counts of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) stratified by 96-trinucleotide contexts. This analysis identified three independent mutational signatures (A, B, and C, STAR Methods), of which two correspond to reported mutation signatures (Alexandrov et al., 2013Alexandrov L.B. Nik-Zainal S. Wedge D.C. Aparicio S.A. Behjati S. Biankin A.V. Bignell G.R. Bolli N. Borg A. Børresen-Dale A.L. et al.Australian Pancreatic Cancer Genome InitiativeICGC Breast Cancer ConsortiumICGC MMML-Seq ConsortiumICGC PedBrainSignatures of mutational processes in human cancer.Nature. 2013; 500: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (6221) Google Scholar) (see also http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures). To identify additional samples with a significant enrichment of each mutational process, we performed a hierarchical clustering of normalized signature activity (Figure S1B). Nine samples significantly associated with the plant-derived carcinogen aristolochic acid (AA) signature had a predominance of A:T-to-T:A transversions at [C|T]AG tri-nucleotide motifs, and these samples had a significant enrichment of splice-site mutations (p = 10−6 by Wilcoxon rank-sum test) due to overlap of the motif with the canonical splice-acceptor site. Seven samples were significantly correlated with mutational signature B (sig B), associated with Aflatoxin B1 exposure, and characterized by an excess of G:C-to-T:A transversions. Aflatoxin B1 exposure is a risk factor for HCC, associated with hotspot mutation R249S. Recurrent TP53-R249S mutant samples had significant enrichment of AFB1 signature activity in comparison to other TP53 mutants (p = 0.005 by Wilcoxon rank-sum) or WT samples (p = 0.0001) (Figure S1C). HBV-positive samples had much higher AFB1 activity than HBV-negative HCC (p = 0.005 by Wilcoxon rank-sum), indicating a likely synergistic interaction between Aflatoxin B1 exposure and HBV. Somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) were determined by profiling HCC on Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays and analysis by GISTIC 2.0. Overall patterns of broad and focal alterations across the entire cohort were similar to earlier reports (Guichard et al., 2012Guichard C. Amaddeo G. Imbeaud S. Ladeiro Y. Pelletier L. Maad I.B. Calderaro J. Bioulac-Sage P. Letexier M. Degos F. et al.Integrated analysis of somatic mutations and focal copy-number changes identifies key genes and pathways in hepatocellular carcinoma.Nat. Genet. 2012; 44: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar, Totoki et al., 2014Totoki Y. Tatsuno K. Covington K.R. Ueda H. Creighton C.J. Kato M. Tsuji S. Donehower L.A. Slagle B.L. Nakamura H. et al.Trans-ancestry mutational landscape of hepatocellular carcinoma genomes.Nat. Genet. 2014; 46: 1267-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) (Figure S2A). Most frequent chromosomal arm alterations included copy number gains in 1q and 8q and copy number losses in 8p and 17p (Figures S2A and S2B). GISTIC 2.0 analysis of all tumors identified 28 significantly reoccurring focal amplifications, including those containing well-characterized driver oncogenes such as CCND1 and FGF19 (11q13.3), MYC (8q24.21), MET (7q31.2), VEGFA (6p21.1), and MCL1 (1q21.3). Moreover, TERT (5p15.33) was amplified in 10% of HCC cases. Among 36 deletion events, 13q14.2 (RB1) and 9p21.3 (CDKN2A) were prominent (Figure S2B). Also seen was a 1p36.23 focal deletion peak that includes the tumor suppressor ERRFI1, recently described in gliomas and HCC (Park et al., 2015Park E. Kim N. Ficarro S.B. Zhang Y. Lee B.I. Cho A. Kim K. Park A.K. Park W.Y. Murray B. et al.Structure and mechanism of activity-based inhibition of the EGF receptor by Mig6.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We noted a 17p11.2 focal deletion that contained the tumor suppressor NCOR1, which functions as a suppressor of beta catenin expression (Song and Gelmann, 2008Song L.N. Gelmann E.P. Silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor and nuclear receptor corepressor attenuate transcriptional activation by the beta-catenin-TCF4 complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25988-25999Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Comparison of genome-scale DNA methylation profiles in normal tissue and HCC revealed significant amounts of both hypo- and hypermethylation in the tumors. Unsupervised clustering of HCC using CpG sites that showed cancer-specific DNA hypermethylation identified four hypermethylation clusters (Figure 2A ). Two clusters (3 and 4) exhibited elevated hypermethylation. Cluster 3 in particular contained all of the tumors with IDH1 and/or IDH2 (IDH1/2) mutations and exhibited a distinct DNA hypermethylation profile (Figure 2A), consistent with previous data that IDH1/2 mutations are gain-of-function lesions that increase levels of cellular D-2-hydroxyglutarate that regulate genomic methylation rates (Lu et al., 2012Lu C. Ward P.S. Kapoor G.S. Rohle D. Turcan S. Abdel-Wahab O. Edwards C.R. Khanin R. Figueroa M.E. Melnick A. et al.IDH mutation impairs histone demethylation and results in a block to cell differentiation.Nature. 2012; 483: 474-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1411) Google Scholar). Cluster 4 HCC cases were disproportionately enriched for CDKN2A epigenetic silencing, TERT promoter mutations, and CTNNB1 mutations (Figure 2A). Asian ethnicity and HBV infection were significantly associated with cluster 1, whereas HCV infection was significantly associated with cluster 4. Two approaches (see STAR Methods) were used to identify those genes with high levels of tumor-specific hypermethylation in conjunction with reduced RNA expression (Table S4A). Seven representative genes frequently hypermethylated in our HCC sample set are shown in Figures 2B–2H. These genes displayed significantly reduced RNA expression correlated with high-frequency promoter hypermethylation. CDKN2A epigenetic silencing was found in 53% (102/191) of samples, whereas CDKN2A mutations were observed in 4% of HCC patients, indicating that DNA methylation is the predominant mechanism for CDKN2A inactivation (Figure 2B, Table S4A) in HCC. Other highly hypermethylated and downregulated genes included HHIP, a suppressor of hedgehog signaling, a pathway important in hepatocarcinogenesis (Zheng et al., 2013Zheng X. Zeng W. Gai X. Xu Q. Li C. Liang Z. Tuo H. Liu Q. Role of the Hedgehog pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma (review).Oncol. Rep. 2013; 30: 2020-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) (Figure 2C, Table S4A), prostaglandin reductase 1 (PTGR1), shown to inhibit lung cancer growth (Zhao et al., 2010Zhao Y. Weng C.C. Tong M. Wei J. Tai H.H. Restoration of leukotriene B(4)-12-hydroxydehydrogenase/15- oxo-prostaglandin 13-reductase (LTBDH/PGR) expression inhibits lung cancer growth in vitro and in vivo.Lung Cancer. 2010; 68: 161-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) (Figure 2D, Table S4A), and TMEM106A, encoding a pro-apoptotic protein downregulated in gastric cancer (Xu et al., 2014Xu D. Qu L. Hu J. Li G. Lv P. Ma D. Guo M. Chen Y. Transmembrane protein 106A is silenced by promoter region hypermethylation and suppresses gastric cancer growth by inducing apoptosis.J. Cell. Mol. Med. 2014; 18: 1655-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (Figure 2E, Table S4A). Members of the metallothionein family, MT1M and MT1E, have been implicated as tumor suppressors in HCC and other cancers (Mao et al., 2012Mao J. Yu H. Wang C. Sun L. Jiang W. Zhang P. Xiao Q. Han D. Saiyin H. Zhu J. et al.Metallothionein MT1M is a tumor suppressor of human hepatocellular carcinomas.Carcinogenesis. 2012; 33: 2568-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (Figures 2F and 2G, Table S4A). Hypermethylation-mediated downregulation of CPS1 (carbamoyl phosphate synthase I), a liver-specific rate-limiting enzyme of the urea cycle reported as a HCC-hypermethylated gene (Liu et al., 2011Liu H. Dong H. Robertson K. Liu C. DNA methylation suppresses expression of the urea cycle enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) in human hepatocellular carcinoma.Am. J. Pathol. 2011; 178: 652-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), may favor glutamine usage in HCC by CAD (carbamoyl phosphate synthase II), which initiates the de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway, thus favoring cell division (Figure 2H, Table S4A). Consistent with this hypothesis, mean CAD RNA levels were 2.8-fold increased in HCC relative to normal liver tissues (p = 6.7 × 10−34), whereas mean CPS1 RNA levels were 2.1-fold reduced in HCC compared to normal liver tissue. Of the 298 genes exhibiting significant HCC-specific hypermethylation, 81 have been reported to be hypermethylated and another 28 have been reported to be downregulated (methylation status unknown) in HCC or other cancers relative to normal tissues (Table S4A). GSEA of these 298 hypermethylated genes showed enrichment for pathways related to differentiation, stem cell maintenance, and targets of the Polycomb repressive complex, a phenomenon previously reported (Widschwendter et al., 2007Widschwendter M. Fiegl H. Egle D. Mueller-Holzner E. Spizzo G. Marth C. Weisenberger D.J. Campan M. Young J. Jacobs I. Laird P.W. Epigenetic stem cell signature in cancer.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 157-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar) (Table S4B). Chronic HBV and HCV infection are major viral risk factors for HCC. In the core TCGA dataset, 44 of 196 (22.4%) patients displayed clinical and molecular evidence of HBV infection. HBV infection was significantly associated with Asian ethnicity, younger age at initial diagnosis, and male gender (Table S5A). HBV+ HCC patients were significantly more likely to be mutated in TP53 and significantly less likely to harbor TERT promoter mutations than HBV− HCC patients. Most (37/44, 84%) HBV-infected HCC patients exhibited evidence of HBV DNA integration into the host genome by analysis of RNA sequence reads for HBV-chromosomal gene fusion transcripts. Such integrated viral genomes raise the possibility of cis-activation or inactivation of cancer regulatory genes, believed to be an occasional source of driver mutations in HCC. RNA fusion-based HBV integration sites identified by two methods are shown in Table S5B. Roughly 50% of HBV integration sites were within genes, though only two genes had recurrent mutations: MLL4, a histone methyltransferase that regulates proliferation and is reported as a frequent HBV integration site (Saigo et al., 2008Saigo K.

The five tumors with MLL4 insertions and one of the two TERT insertions displayed the highest levels of MLL4 and TERT RNA expression among all HCC, suggesting an HBV cis-activating event (Table S5C). Among the non-recurring HBV insertional events associated with very high levels of RNA transcription, potential driver events were observed. These include known oncogenes CCND1, CCNE1, and GLI2 (a sonic hedgehog transcription factor). Thus, the effect of HBV on transcriptional levels of key oncogenes demonstrated potential driver events affecting a number of patients. In our HCC samples, 35 of 196 (17.9%) patients exhibited serological and/or molecular markers of HCV infection, by presence of HCV antibody or HCV RNA as determined by commercial HCV RNA testing or by sequence analysis. HCV infection was significantly higher in white and black patients than Asian patients and in patients with cirrhosis (Figure 1). HCV+ tumors displayed significantly increased frequency of CDKN2A promoter silencing (p = 0.0061) and TERT promoter mutation (p = 0.014). Unsupervised clustering of data from five platforms (DNA copy number, DNA methylation, mRNA expression, miRNA expression and RPPA) resulted in a collection of discordant subgroupings specific to each data platform. To reconcile these disparate data types, we used a joint multivariate regression approach (see STAR Methods) to simultaneously cluster data from the five platforms. This comprehensive approach resolved three major subtypes (Figure 3A , Figures S3A and S3B). The majority of individual platform cluster solutions concentrated preferentially in one of the three integrated iCluster solutions with p < 0.0001 (Figures S3A and S3C), lending confidence that the aggregate solution captured the main features of each platform. The association of the three iClusters with demographic, pathologic, and molecular features of the HCC patients strengthened the clinical relevance of the subtypes defined by the iCluster procedure.Figure S3iCluster Correlation with Molecular, Demographic, and Clinical Features of HCC, Relat"

Here, we perform deep single-cell RNA sequencing on 5,063 single T cells isolated from peripheral blood, tumor, and adjacent normal tissues from six hepatocellular carcinoma patients. The transcriptional profiles of these individual cells, coupled with assembled T cell receptor (TCR) sequences, enable us to identify 11 T cell subsets based on their molecular and functional properties and delineate their developmental trajectory. Specific subsets such as exhausted CD8+ T cells and Tregs are preferentially enriched and potentially clonally expanded in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and we identified signature genes for each subset. One of the genes, layilin, is upregulated on activated CD8+ T cells and Tregs and represses the CD8+ T cell functions in vitro. This compendium of transcriptome data provides valuable insights and a rich resource for understanding the immune landscape in cancers."

https://openalex.org/W2658281240,"In a mouse model of spinal cord injury, reactive astrogliosis is found to be context dependent and reversible. Blockade of type I collagen–reactive astrocyte interactions prevents astrocyte scar formation and facilitates functional recovery after injury. Central nervous system (CNS) injury transforms naive astrocytes into reactive astrocytes, which eventually become scar-forming astrocytes that can impair axonal regeneration and functional recovery. This sequential phenotypic change, known as reactive astrogliosis, has long been considered unidirectional and irreversible. However, we report here that reactive astrocytes isolated from injured spinal cord reverted in retrograde to naive astrocytes when transplanted into a naive spinal cord, whereas they formed astrocytic scars when transplanted into injured spinal cord, indicating the environment-dependent plasticity of reactive astrogliosis. We also found that type I collagen was highly expressed in the spinal cord during the scar-forming phase and induced astrocytic scar formation via the integrin–N-cadherin pathway. In a mouse model of spinal cord injury, pharmacological blockade of reactive astrocyte–type I collagen interaction prevented astrocytic scar formation, thereby leading to improved axonal regrowth and better functional outcomes. Our findings reveal environmental cues regulating astrocytic fate decisions, thereby providing a potential therapeutic target for CNS injury."

Linkage disequilibrium score regression of 220 cell types implicated the regulation of myeloid gene expression in AD risk. The minor allele of rs1057233 (G), within the previously reported CELF1 AD risk locus, showed association with delayed AD onset and lower expression of SPI1 in monocytes and macrophages. SPI1 encodes PU.1, a transcription factor critical for myeloid cell development and function. AD heritability was enriched within the PU.1 cistrome, implicating a myeloid PU.1 target gene network in AD. Finally, experimentally altered PU.1 levels affected the expression of mouse orthologs of many AD risk genes and the phagocytic activity of mouse microglial cells. Our results suggest that lower SPI1 expression reduces AD risk by regulating myeloid gene expression and cell function."

https://openalex.org/W2626179297,"Sepsis is an often lethal syndrome resulting from maladaptive immune and metabolic responses to infection, compromising host homeostasis. Disease tolerance is a defense strategy against infection that preserves host homeostasis without exerting a direct negative impact on pathogens. Here, we demonstrate that induction of the iron-sequestering ferritin H chain (FTH) in response to polymicrobial infections is critical to establish disease tolerance to sepsis. The protective effect of FTH is exerted via a mechanism that counters iron-driven oxidative inhibition of the liver glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), and in doing so, sustains endogenous glucose production via liver gluconeogenesis. This is required to prevent the development of hypoglycemia that otherwise compromises disease tolerance to sepsis. FTH overexpression or ferritin administration establish disease tolerance therapeutically. In conclusion, disease tolerance to sepsis relies on a crosstalk between adaptive responses controlling iron and glucose metabolism, required to maintain blood glucose within a physiologic range compatible with host survival."
https://openalex.org/W2626627929,"Higher eukaryotic chromosomes are organized into topologically constrained functional domains; however, the molecular mechanisms required to sustain these complex interphase chromatin structures are unknown. A stable matrix underpinning nuclear organization was hypothesized, but the idea was abandoned as more dynamic models of chromatin behavior became prevalent. Here, we report that scaffold attachment factor A (SAF-A), originally identified as a structural nuclear protein, interacts with chromatin-associated RNAs (caRNAs) via its RGG domain to regulate human interphase chromatin structures in a transcription-dependent manner. Mechanistically, this is dependent on SAF-A's AAA+ ATPase domain, which mediates cycles of protein oligomerization with caRNAs, in response to ATP binding and hydrolysis. SAF-A oligomerization decompacts large-scale chromatin structure while SAF-A loss or monomerization promotes aberrant chromosome folding and accumulation of genome damage. Our results show that SAF-A and caRNAs form a dynamic, transcriptionally responsive chromatin mesh that organizes large-scale chromosome structures and protects the genome from instability."

Ramon y Cajal, 1906 Nobel lecture). Layer 6 (L6) CTs are glutamatergic pyramidal neurons, yet their targeted activation via optogenetic strategies primarily induces a net suppression of spontaneous and sensory-evoked activity in the cortex via direct connections onto local fast-spiking (FS) inhibitory neurons (Bortone et al., 2014Bortone D.S.

Whereas activating L6 CT neurons scales down sensory-evoked responses in most layers of the cortical column, these neurons’ effect on thalamic responses is a mixture of modest facilitation and suppression (Denman and Contreras, 2015Denman D.J.

A recent study performed in somatosensory thalamocortical slice preparation has set up a new framework for studying these circuits by showing that their mode of modulation depends entirely on timing: L6 CT neurons can dynamically mediate either synaptic suppression or enhancement, depending on the frequency and time course of their activation (Crandall et al., 2015Crandall S.R. Cruikshank S.J. Connors B.W. A corticothalamic switch: controlling the thalamus with dynamic synapses.Neuron. 2015; 86: 768-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Here, we pursue this idea in the intact animal by showing that L6 CT neurons can impose multiple forms of modulation on auditory responses in the primary auditory cortex (A1) and medial geniculate body of the thalamus (MGB), where again the sign of modulation—suppression or enhancement—depends on the timing between sensory stimuli and L6 CT spiking. Enhancement or suppression of cortical sensory representations has an immediate and direct impact on perceptual salience as studied behaviorally (Froemke et al., 2013Froemke R.C. Carcea I. Barker A.J. Yuan K. Seybold B.A. Martins A.R.O. Zaika N. Bernstein H. Wachs M. Levis P.A. et al.Long-term modification of cortical synapses improves sensory perception.Nat.

Studies of sensory processing in humans and non-human primates suggest that cortical networks can enhance detection, segregate stimulus sources, and suppress distracting stimuli by organizing the frequency and phase of low-frequency oscillations in the cortical electrical field (Giraud and Poeppel, 2012Giraud A.-L. Poeppel D. Cortical oscillations and speech processing: emerging computational principles and operations.Nat.

Low-frequency neuronal oscillations as instruments of sensory selection.Trends Neurosci. 2009; 32: 9-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). A stimulus falling on the high-excitability phase of a cortical oscillation would recruit strong spiking in principal neurons and robust perception, whereas the same stimulus falling on the low excitability phase might fail to drive spiking activity and could go undetected (Lakatos et al., 2008Lakatos P.

A neural circuit responsible for controlling the phase of low-frequency cortical rhythms has yet to be identified. Here, we present findings that bring these studies into alignment by showing that L6 CT neurons, in agreement with studies in the acute thalamocortical slice, can both enhance and suppress activity in the cortex and thalamus of awake mice depending on the temporal interval between their spiking and sensory-evoked responses (Crandall et al., 2015Crandall S.R. Cruikshank S.J. Connors B.W. A corticothalamic switch: controlling the thalamus with dynamic synapses.Neuron. 2015; 86: 768-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In keeping with prior observations in visual cortex, we also find that L6 CT neurons are functionally connected with a subtype of FS interneuron that modulates sensory gain in all layers of the cortical column (Bortone et al., 2014Bortone D.S. Olsen S.R. Scanziani M. Translaminar inhibitory cells recruited by layer 6 corticothalamic neurons suppress visual cortex.Neuron. 2014; 82: 474-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, Olsen et al., 2012Olsen S.R. Bortone D.S. Adesnik H. Scanziani M. Gain control by layer six in cortical circuits of vision.Nature. 2012; 483: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Finally, as per recent studies in non-human primates, we show that activating and deactivating L6 CT and FS neurons generates distinct cortical rhythms that modulate the excitability of cortical sensory responses and bias perceptual processing toward modes that favor the enhanced detection of faint sounds or the enhanced resolution of similar sounds (Lakatos et al., 2008Lakatos P. Karmos G. Mehta A.D. Ulbert I. Schroeder C.E. Entrainment of neuronal oscillations as a mechanism of attentional selection.Science. 2008; 320: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). However, unlike earlier studies, we report here that the most striking effects of L6 CT neurons on thalamocortical sound processing and auditory perception are found immediately after L6 CT neurons stop spiking; concurrent presentation of sound stimuli with L6 CT activation induces a weaker additive increase in spiking with no demonstrable effect on sound detection or discrimination. Recent studies of corticothalamic modulation have taken advantage of the Ntsr1-Cre transgenic mouse, which labels a subpopulation of pyramidal neurons in L6 that have both short-range vertical connections within the cortical column and subcortical projections that deposit axon collaterals in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) en route to the dorsal thalamus (Bortone et al., 2014Bortone D.S.

Gain control by layer six in cortical circuits of vision.Nature. 2012; 483: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Anatomical tracer experiments in the visual and somatosensory cortex confirmed that virtually all Ntsr1-positive neurons (Ntsr1+) are L6 corticothalamic (L6 CT), and virtually all L6 CT neurons are Ntsr1+ (Bortone et al., 2014Bortone D.S.

Neurosci. 2014; 34: 9656-9664Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To determine whether the same specificity exists in the auditory cortex, we crossed the Ntsr1-Cre line with a Cre-dependent tdTomato reporter line and injected green fluorescent microspheres into the MGB of their double-transgenic offspring (Figure 1A). After allowing the beads 1 week for retrograde transport, we immunolabeled coronal sections of the auditory cortex for the ubiquitous neuron marker NeuN and compared the colocalization of beads in Ntsr1+ neurons (n = 824 neurons from eight hemispheres of four mice, Figures 1B–1D). We observed that approximately 35% of L6 neurons neither projected to the MGB nor expressed Ntsr1; they were therefore most likely intracortical neurons (Figures 1E–1F, left bars). Among Ntsr1+ neurons, 97% also contained beads, indicating that nearly all Ntsr1+ neurons are CT. This is remarkable, considering that the not all CT neurons would necessarily be expected to innervate the region of the lateral MGB targeted for retrobead injection (Figure 1E). Conversely, 90% of L6 CT neurons were also Ntsr1+ (Figure 1F). Therefore, while a small fraction of L6 CT neurons may not express Ntsr1-Cre, virtually all Ntsr1+ neurons in the auditory cortex are in L6 and are CT, confirming prior reports made in the visual and somatosensory cortex that the Ntsr1-Cre line offers a powerful approach to the study of L6 CT projection neurons. To manipulate the activity of L6 CT neurons, we expressed channelrhodopsin (ChR2) in the auditory cortex of adult Ntsr1-Cre mice using a Cre-dependent viral construct. Ntsr1+ soma were observed in L6 with intense neuropil staining in L4 of A1 and the ipsilateral MGB and a fainter band of labeling in L1 (Figure 2A). We recorded unit activity from all layers of the primary auditory cortex (A1) in awake, head-fixed mice while activating L6 CT neurons with blue light (n = 418 recording sites from 11 mice; Figures 2B and 2C). Whereas optogenetic activation of L6 CT neurons suppresses spiking in V1 (Olsen et al., 2012Olsen S.R. Bortone D.S. Adesnik H. Scanziani M. Gain control by layer six in cortical circuits of vision.Nature. 2012; 483: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), it increases firing rates in all layers of A1 (Figure 2D; refer to Table S1 and figure legends for all statistical reporting). Closer inspection revealed that firing rate elevation was observed at the onset and steady state of laser activation, yet robust suppression of spiking was observed at a short delay following the offset of laser activation (50–100 ms after laser offset) and followed by rebound excitation at a longer delay after laser offset (150–200 ms after laser offset) (Figure 2E). Thus, the effect of optogenetically activating L6 CT neurons in A1 was opposite to prior reports in V1. Moreover, deactivation of L6 CT neurons upon laser offset initiated an alternating pattern of spiking suppression and facilitation that has not been described previously. None of these phenomena were observed in Ntsr1-Cre mice injected with a reporter virus that did not encode ChR2 (Figure S1). As a next step, we characterized how dynamic changes in columnar excitability elicited by L6 CT activation affected sound-evoked responses and frequency tuning. We measured pure tone frequency tuning from A1 units with or without optogenetic activation of L6 CT units (Figure 3A). Because optogenetic activation of L6 CTs induced alternating periods of enhancement and suppression, we staggered the onset of pure tone stimuli relative to laser onset at 17 discrete intervals (0–800 ms in 50 ms steps; Figure 3B). As illustrated from a representative L4 unit recording, L6 CT activation induced clear modulation of both auditory responsiveness and auditory tuning (Figure 3C). The modulation was divergent, alternating between enhancement during L6 CT activation, suppression immediately following the deactivation of L6 CT neurons, and then a second enhancement at longer delays following laser offset. Sensory response modulation can be expressed as a linear transformation from responses without laser (roff) to responses with laser (ron) by the formula ron = a × roff + b, where additive or subtractive modulation (b > 0 or b < 0, respectively) reflect constant shifts across the entire tuning function and multiplicative or divisive gain (a > 1, a < 1, respectively) reflects scaling changes that preserve the shape of the tuning function (Seybold et al., 2015Seybold B.A. Phillips E.A.K. Schreiner C.E. Hasenstaub A.R. Inhibitory actions unified by network integration.Neuron. 2015; 87: 1181-1192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In V1, L6 CT activation induces a purely divisive scaling change, such that visual responses were suppressed without affecting orientation tuning (Olsen et al., 2012Olsen S.R. Bortone D.S. Adesnik H. Scanziani M. Gain control by layer six in cortical circuits of vision.Nature. 2012; 483: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Referring to the same representative L4 unit shown in Figure 3C, we observed a purely additive shift during L6 CT activation, divisive gain when tones were presented at a short delay following laser offset, and a multiplicative gain when tones were presented at a longer delay after laser offset (Figure 3D). By contrast, a representative L6 unit was strongly activated by the laser (likely because it expressed ChR2) but did not show any notable changes in auditory responsiveness after laser offset (Figure 3E). These effects were summarized by plotting the mean additive or subtractive and multiplicative or divisive modulation in Cartesian coordinates where pure shifting changes fell on the x axis, pure scaling changes fell along the y axis, and mixtures of shifting and scaling modulation fell on the diagonals. For units in L6, the effect of L6 CT activation was straightforward and matched prior reports in V1: the evoked-firing rate change was purely additive during laser with comparatively modest modulation at later time periods. For units in L2/3-L5, L6 CT activation induced a tripartite modulation of auditory responses: additive scaling during L6 CT activation, divisive gain shortly after L6 CT deactivation (50 ms following laser offset), and multiplicative gain at a longer delay following L6 CT deactivation (150 ms following laser offset) (Figure 3F). One possibility is that these dynamics arose from an unrealistically long and intense period of L6 CT activation. We controlled for this by performing the same measurements with a shorter laser pulse set to a minimally effective amplitude (50 ms, 5 mW above threshold). The results of this stimulation paradigm were largely the same (Figure 3G). As a negative control for non-specific effects of laser activation on A1 receptive fields, we did not observe any systematic modulation of auditory responses in Ntsr1-Cre mice that expressed only a control fluorophore in L6 CT units (n = 96 recording sites from three mice; Figure 3G, inset). Importantly, the modulation of tone-evoked responses after laser offset was not purely divisive or multiplicative. The significant subtractive and additive components observed in the short- and long-delay modulation, respectively, suggested that the precision of frequency tuning was also affected. Indeed, for several cortical layers, frequency tuning was significantly narrower during the short delay period and significantly wider during the long delay period following laser offset (Figure 3H). To study L6 CT modulation of sound perception, we implanted optic fibers over the left and right auditory cortex of Ntsr1-Cre mice that expressed ChR2 in A1 of both hemispheres and measured their sound detection and discrimination performance in an auditory avoidance task (n = 5 mice). In this task, mice were trained to cross from one side of a shuttlebox to the other shortly following the presentation of tone pips at the target frequency, but not to foil tones at other frequencies (Figure 4A). The distinct forms of receptive field modulation during L6 CT activation or shortly following L6 CT deactivation inspired two hypotheses (Figure 4B, left): 1) The divisive or subtractive gain observed at a short delay following laser offset (50 ms) would suppress A1 activity, thereby impairing tone detection; however, the sharper tuning would improve frequency discrimination. 2) Conversely, the multiplicative or additive gain observed at the longer delay period following laser offset (150 ms) would enhance tone-evoked activity and improve tone detection performance; however, the loss of tuning precision would impair tone discrimination. We tested these predictions by interleaving behavioral trials where 50 ms tone pips were presented 1) without L6 CT activation (tone alone), 2) concurrent with 50 ms pulses of L6 CT activation, 3) shortly after L6 CT deactivation, or 4) at a longer delay following L6 CT deactivation (Figure 4B, right). Importantly, activating L6 CT neurons without tone presentation did not cause mice to “hear the light” and cross sides of the shuttle box, as described previously with non-specific optogenetic activation of subcortical auditory centers (Guo et al., 2015Guo W. Hight A.E. Chen J.X. Klapoetke N.C. Hancock K.E. Shinn-Cunningham B.G. Boyden E.S. Lee D.J. Polley D.B. Hearing the light: neural and perceptual encoding of optogenetic stimulation in the central auditory pathway.Sci. Rep. 2015; 5: 10319Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) (Figure 4C, left). Mice performed predictably on tone-alone trials; the likelihood of detecting the target tone increased with sound level, and false alarms with these easily discriminable frequencies were rare (Figure 4C, black). Concurrent L6 CT activation did not affect tone detection performance (Figure 4C, orange). Compared to tone-alone trials, target detection was impaired in short-delay trials but significantly enhanced in long-delay trials—without any non-specific effects on foil tones (Figure 4C, purple and green). We observed the opposite pattern of perceptual changes when mice were required to discriminate between increasingly similar tone frequencies rather than to detect faint tones. In the tone-alone condition, mice were unable to discriminate the target and foil frequencies when they differed by 10% or less (Figure 4D, black). Concurrent L6 CT activation had no effect on tone discrimination (Figure 4D, orange). In the short delay period, where divisive or subtractive modulation dominated A1 responses, accurate discrimination of targets and foils persisted at frequency differences as small as 10%, even though detection was impaired overall (Figure 4D, purple). In the long delay period, where multiplicative or additive modulation was prevalent, discrimination was impaired for targets and foils that were separated by as much as 20%, even though detection of target tones was enhanced overall (Figure 4D, green). These findings demonstrate that L6 CT neurons can enhance sensory feature detection or discrimination depending on the relative timing between their activation and sensory stimuli. Compared to tone-alone trials, detection thresholds were elevated by 11.2 ± 1.9 dB when tones were presented 50 ms after L6 CT neurons were deactivated, but were improved by 11.4 ± 2.6 dB on trials where the delay was just 100 ms longer (Figure 4E). On the other hand, the threshold for mistaking the foil tone frequency for the target frequency (false alarm) was reduced to a 8.7% ± 1.17% difference at the short delay following L6 CT deactivation but was increased to 20.7% ± 1.87% on long-delay trials (Figure 4F). Discriminability of similar tones (10% between target and foil), estimated here with the d′ statistic, was only significantly different than zero during the short delay period when A1 responses were suppressed and tuning was more precise (Figure 4G). Thus, the perceptual effects of L6 CT activation were robust (net effect on tone detectability and discriminability > 20 dB and > 25%, respectively), were only observed in trials where"

Through next-generation sequencing on a cohort of patients with severe atopic dermatitis with and without comorbid infections, we found eight individuals, from four families, with novel heterozygous mutations in CARD11, which encodes a scaffolding protein involved in lymphocyte receptor signaling. Disease improved over time in most patients. Transfection of mutant CARD11 expression constructs into T cell lines demonstrated both loss-of-function and dominant-interfering activity upon antigen receptor-induced activation of nuclear factor-κB and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Patient T cells had similar defects, as well as low production of the cytokine interferon-γ (IFN-γ). The mTORC1 and IFN-γ production defects were partially rescued by supplementation with glutamine, which requires CARD11 for import into T cells. Our findings indicate that a single hypomorphic mutation in CARD11 can cause potentially correctable cellular defects that lead to atopic dermatitis."
https://openalex.org/W2707238276,"Optogenetics promises precise spatiotemporal control of neural processes using light. However, the spatial extent of illumination within the brain is difficult to control and cannot be adjusted using standard fiber optics. We demonstrate that optical fibers with tapered tips can be used to illuminate either spatially restricted or large brain volumes. Remotely adjusting the light input angle to the fiber varies the light-emitting portion of the taper over several millimeters without movement of the implant. We use this mode to activate dorsal versus ventral striatum of individual mice and reveal different effects of each manipulation on motor behavior. Conversely, injecting light over the full numerical aperture of the fiber results in light emission from the entire taper surface, achieving broader and more efficient optogenetic activation of neurons, compared to standard flat-faced fiber stimulation. Thus, tapered fibers permit focal or broad illumination that can be precisely and dynamically matched to experimental needs."
https://openalex.org/W2625757644,"It has been assumed that DNA synthesis by the leading- and lagging-strand polymerases in the replisome must be coordinated to avoid the formation of significant gaps in the nascent strands. Using real-time single-molecule analysis, we establish that leading- and lagging-strand DNA polymerases function independently within a single replisome. Although average rates of DNA synthesis on leading and lagging strands are similar, individual trajectories of both DNA polymerases display stochastically switchable rates of synthesis interspersed with distinct pauses. DNA unwinding by the replicative helicase may continue during such pauses, but a self-governing mechanism, where helicase speed is reduced by ∼80%, permits recoupling of polymerase to helicase. These features imply a more dynamic, kinetically discontinuous replication process, wherein contacts within the replisome are continually broken and reformed. We conclude that the stochastic behavior of replisome components ensures complete DNA duplication without requiring coordination of leading- and lagging-strand synthesis.PaperClip/cms/asset/fc7cac76-d171-43ee-98c5-9131daede570/mmc7.mp3Loading ...(mp3, 2.13 MB) Download audio"
https://openalex.org/W2625353712,"This study characterizes the properties of disease-causing mutations that produce sporadic amino acid replacements in proteins of people with autism and developmental delay. The mutations tend to cluster and reoccur at specific regions important to protein function, highlighting for future follow-up ∼200 candidate genes, many involved in neuronal signaling. Although de novo missense mutations have been predicted to account for more cases of autism than gene-truncating mutations, most research has focused on the latter. We identified the properties of de novo missense mutations in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) and highlight 35 genes with excess missense mutations. Additionally, 40 amino acid sites were recurrently mutated in 36 genes, and targeted sequencing of 20 sites in 17,688 patients with NDD identified 21 new patients with identical missense mutations. One recurrent site substitution (p.A636T) occurs in a glutamate receptor subunit, GRIA1. This same amino acid substitution in the homologous but distinct mouse glutamate receptor subunit Grid2 is associated with Lurcher ataxia. Phenotypic follow-up in five individuals with GRIA1 mutations shows evidence of specific learning disabilities and autism. Overall, we find significant clustering of de novo mutations in 200 genes, highlighting specific functional domains and synaptic candidate genes important in NDD pathology."

It is easy to take for granted that if someone bumps your arm as you are trying to hand them a cup of coffee, your initial response is not undirected arm flailing. Instead, your nervous system processes sensory feedback related to the perturbation in order to generate corrective movements that still deliver the cup without spilling the coffee. But this seeming simplicity belies sophisticated computations. Sensory afferents cause widespread neural activity changes throughout your sensorimotor system, including in areas such as the motor cortex that can generate muscle contractions (Archambault et al., 2011Archambault P.S.

Scott S.H. Goal-dependent modulation of fast feedback responses in primary motor cortex.J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 4608-4617Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Eventually, this evoked response is transformed into a corrective action (i.e., sensorimotor feedback), but there is a period of time when it is not yet suitable for output to the muscles. This leads to the central question: what keeps the initial response from “leaking out” and prematurely moving the arm before the appropriate commands to downstream motor system targets are ready? This question is germane at multiple levels of the motor system and its interaction with multiple sensory modalities, as well as the broader question of how neural circuits flexibly isolate their activity from downstream targets. Here, we investigated how the early phase of a visually signaled perturbation’s motor cortical response avoids affecting ongoing voluntary movement. Feedback-related neural activity needs to be decoupled from directly causing behavioral output because cortex is not just a one-to-one relay between sensory afferents and motor efferents. Movement corrections depend not only on the specifics of the perturbation, but also on the movement goal and state of the musculoskeletal system (Cluff et al., 2014Cluff T. Crevecoeur F. Scott S.H. A perspective on multisensory integration and rapid perturbation responses.Vision Res. 2014; 110: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, Scott, 2012Scott S.H. The computational and neural basis of voluntary motor control and planning.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2012; 16: 541-549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). This presents three possibilities for motor cortex’s role in this input-output isolation. The first is that the transformation is finished upstream, such that inputs to motor cortex immediately cause the right movement-generating activity. This, however, just pushes the question of how computation is isolated from output upstream: how do areas projecting to motor cortex transform their inputs without prematurely affecting motor cortex? A variant of this it-is-solved-upstream possibility is that the necessary computations happen via dendritic processing at the motor cortical inputs (Mel, 1994Mel B.W. Information processing in dendritic trees.Neural Comput. 1994; 6: 1031-1085Crossref Google Scholar). Arguing against this are studies showing that initial motor cortical spiking responses to mechanical arm perturbations are non-specific to the perturbation and behavioral context and differ from subsequent correction-specific responses (Herter et al., 2009Herter T.M.

Furthermore, the motor cortical data we will present show that initial responses to visual perturbations are inappropriate for generating corrections. These results are inconsistent with sensorimotor transformations being fully completed prior to (or in the synapses arriving at) motor cortex. They instead suggest that at least some portion of the process, and its isolation from downstream targets, can be investigated in motor cortex. A second possibility is that the initial motor cortical response fails to cause movement due to temporary inhibitory “gating” of its downstream targets. This mechanism was proposed to explain how movement preparation avoids prematurely contracting muscles (Benjamin et al., 2010Benjamin P.R. Staras K. Kemenes G. What roles do tonic inhibition and disinhibition play in the control of motor programs?.Front. Behav. Neurosci. 2010; 4: 30PubMed Google Scholar, Bullock and Grossberg, 1988Bullock D. Grossberg S.

Neurosci. 2000; 3: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). However, previous studies have argued against inhibitory gating being generated by motor cortex (Kaufman et al., 2010Kaufman M.T. Churchland M.M. Santhanam G. Yu B.M. Afshar A. Ryu S.I. Shenoy K.V. Roles of monkey premotor neuron classes in movement preparation and execution.J. Neurophysiol. 2010; 104: 799-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, Kaufman et al., 2013Kaufman M.T.

Neurophysiol. 2013; 110: 817-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and suggested that such gating is unnecessary (Kaufman et al., 2014Kaufman M.T. Churchland M.M. Ryu S.I. Shenoy K.V. Cortical activity in the null space: permitting preparation without movement.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 440-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Furthermore, gating feedback-related activity would be particularly difficult, because unlike when withholding all movements, the mechanism would have to selectively pass through ongoing movement commands but block premature corrective commands. We will present evidence consistent with a third possibility: perturbation-evoked motor cortical activity changes, putatively reflecting the area’s role in sensorimotor transformations, have population-level structure such that this activity does not cause premature movement-generating output. Under the “output null” hypothesis, the nervous system takes advantage of there being a redundant many-to-few mapping between a neural circuit and its downstream targets. This redundancy means that there are a variety of different output-null firing rate patterns that will nonetheless be read out identically downstream. Neuroscientists have long recognized that this property of null spaces could allow a circuit’s readout to be invariant to certain types of changes, such as in perceptual color constancy (Maloney and Wandell, 1986Maloney L.T. Wandell B.A. Color constancy: a method for recovering surface spectral reflectance.J. Opt. Soc. Am. A. 1986; 3: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar), time-invariant working memory of a sensory stimulus (Druckmann and Chklovskii, 2012Druckmann S. Chklovskii D.B. Neuronal circuits underlying persistent representations despite time varying activity.Curr. Biol. 2012; 22: 2095-2103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), or the output from cortex to muscles (Todorov, 2000Todorov E. Direct cortical control of muscle activation in voluntary arm movements: a model.Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). More recent studies have suggested that reliable motor planning (Li et al., 2016Li N. Daie K. Svoboda K. Druckmann S. Robust neuronal dynamics in premotor cortex during motor planning.Nature. 2016; 532: 459-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and motor control (Flint et al., 2016Flint R.D. Scheid M.R. Wright Z.A. Solla S.A. Slutzky M.W. Long-term stability of motor cortical activity: implications for brain machine interfaces and optimal feedback control.J. Neurosci. 2016; 36: 3623-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) is achieved by motor cortical circuits tolerating output-null firing rate changes while selectively maintaining the stability of different, “output-potent” patterns that do affect movements. It was recently proposed that neural circuits could not only “ignore” irrelevant output-null activity changes but also exploit this phenomenon to isolate their computations from downstream targets (Kaufman et al., 2014Kaufman M.T. Churchland M.M. Ryu S.I. Shenoy K.V. Cortical activity in the null space: permitting preparation without movement.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 440-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Kaufman and colleagues presented evidence that this allows preparatory activity in the primary motor cortex (M1) to vary without causing movement and dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) activity to vary without affecting M1, during the instructed delay period of a reaching task. The present report extends this hypothesis to the case where feedback-related activity needs to be prevented from prematurely affecting ongoing movement. Figure 1 depicts a simple two-neuron example to illustrate this hypothesis. This mechanism does not require a separate gating command from motor cortex or other sensorimotor loop nodes and allows interactions between motor cortex’s state and new perturbation-related inputs (e.g., error-correcting computations) to initially occur without changing downstream activity. Motor corrections could subsequently be generated by projecting the appropriate activity patterns into the output-potent neural dimensions. We present key new evidence consistent with the prediction that cortical activity is isolated from downstream targets using an output-null mechanism. In particular, we exploit certain advantages of brain-machine interface (BMI) experiments, discussed below, to definitively show for the first time that this mechanism is sufficient to isolate motor cortical activity from its effector. In principle, the output-null hypothesis is straightforward to test: here it reduces to testing whether the initial perturbation-evoked motor cortical response cancels out when read out by the motor effector. The analytical and experimental difficulty lies in determining what firing rate patterns are output-null versus output-potent. Relating motor cortex activity to arm movements is complicated by the fact that corticospinal commands are modulated by other cortical, subcortical, cerebellar, and spinal circuits, many of which also affect movements themselves (Cisek and Kalaska, 2010Cisek P. Kalaska J.F. Neural mechanisms for interacting with a world full of action choices.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 33: 269-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar, Ramnani, 2006Ramnani N.

Optimal feedback control and the neural basis of volitional motor control.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 532-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Furthermore, current techniques are limited to recording but a small fraction of both the motor cortical population (e.g., hundreds of electrodes) and neuromuscular activity (e.g., EMG from a few muscles). Nonetheless, it is possible to approximate this relationship as a linear mapping described by a matrix multiplication; this allows output-potent and output-null neural dimensions to be identified from the row and null spaces of this matrix, respectively (Kaufman et al., 2014Kaufman M.T. Churchland M.M. Ryu S.I. Shenoy K.V. Cortical activity in the null space: permitting preparation without movement.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 440-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In this study, we used a two-pronged strategy for determining output-potent and output-null firing rate patterns. We first estimated a linear mapping, Warm, between motor cortical activity and hand endpoint velocity (Figure 1A). This allowed us to examine whether the initial neural response to step perturbations of the position of a visual cursor that otherwise tracked the hand was (putatively) output-null. However, this approach is limited by the aforementioned inexactness of Warm; it is a linear approximation of a mapping from an incomplete view of the brain acting upon an incomplete view of the body. To overcome this limitation (at the cost of using a simplified experimental preparation), we took advantage of the ability to completely define the mapping Wbmi between recorded motor cortical activity and cursor movement (Figure 1B). During BMI use, cortical activity directly and fully determines the behavior of the effector, making this a powerful experimental paradigm for studying cortical control of movement (Athalye et al., 2017Athalye V.R.

Examining perturbation-evoked neural activity during both arm-controlled and BMI-controlled movements allowed us to bolster the understanding arising from studying natural reaching with complementary understanding of BMI behavior, where more comprehensive measurements are possible. These BMI experiments also allowed us to test a secondary question of practical relevance to motor neural prosthesis development: should we be concerned that directly linking cortex to an effector will result in sensory feedback causing deleterious decoder output? A preliminary report on this aspect of the study appeared in a conference proceeding (Stavisky et al., 2015aStavisky, S.D., Kao, J.C., Sorokin, J.M., Ryu, S.I., and Shenoy, K.V. (2015a). System identification of brain-machine interface control using a cursor jump perturbation. In 2015 7th International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering, (IEEE), pp. 643–647.Google Scholar). In this first section, we describe experiments probing motor cortical population dynamics following perturbations during arm movements. Our goal, subject to the aforementioned caveats, was to test whether the output-null hypothesis explains why early visual feedback-related responses do not cause movement. We recorded a combination of single- and multi-unit spikes from multielectrode arrays implanted in M1 and caudal PMd of macaques performing arm-controlled “radial 8 target” and “cursor jump” tasks. Data were collected from monkeys J and L specifically for this study. When we found that partitioning monkey L’s neural data during arm reaching into putatively output-null and output-potent components (described below) yielded results that were less clear than monkey J’s, we also analyzed data from a third monkey, R, who had performed variants of these arm-controlled tasks as part of a different study. The tasks required making arm reaches in a vertical plane in order to move a cursor from the workspace center to a radial target and hold it there for half a second. The key cursor jump manipulation was that on a random 20%–30% of trials, the cursor’s position was suddenly offset perpendicular to the “task axis” connecting the workspace center to the radial target. This large perturbation was randomly chosen be in one of two directions and occurred after a specific “jump event type” condition was met; Figure 2A shows representative arm-controlled cursor trajectories for each jump event type. Jumps occurred either mid-movement (near the time of peak reach speed) or while the monkey tried to hold his hand still during the target hold period (Figure 2B). Monkeys responded to perturbations mid-movement by curving the cursor’s trajectory toward the target and to jumps during hold by returning the cursor to the target. They did not require additional training to perform this task and showed little to no improvement over the course of these experiments (Figure S1A). Figure 2C insets show that across jump event types and monkeys, mean times to target for jump trials increased from 49% to 111% compared to unperturbed trials. Jumps during hold took longer to correct than jumps at 6 cm (J and L), and larger displacement jumps at 4 cm took longer to correct than smaller displacement jumps at 3 cm (R); both of these effects were expected given the task and jump geometries. Firing rates and hand velocity exhibited strong changes in response to cursor jumps (Figure 2C). We could detect changes in hand velocity as early as 167 ms (J), 183 ms (R), and 211 ms (L) following the perturbation. Across monkeys and jump event types, the earliest detectable jump-evoked neural responses preceded kinematic changes: firing rate changes led velocity changes by 71 ms (J jump at 6 cm), 150 ms (J jump during hold), 74 ms (L jump at 6 cm), 83 ms (L jump during hold), and 78 ms (R jump at 3-4 cm). The observed differences among the three monkeys’ neural response latencies may partially reflect underlying individual monkey differences: the {J earliest, R second, L latest} order is the same as both the ordering of mean times to target and hand velocity change latencies. This could indicate a relationship between motor cortical visual feedback latency and other aspects of sensorimotor system swiftness, but comprehensively testing this would require data from more animals and behaviors. Monkey L’s older age (19 years, compared to J’s 13 years and R’s 9 years), as well as monkey R’s different task layout, may also have affected their respective response latencies. However, these differences were likely magnified by monkey J having the highest trial counts and the greatest number of working electrodes; this provided the statistical power to detect very small firing rate changes 64 ms after the cursor jump rather than the more prominent response ∼35 ms later. Two features of these cursor jump response data are suggestive of the initial motor cortical responses somehow avoiding affecting arm movements. First, the aforementioned latencies between firing rate and kinematic changes exceed the minimum time it takes for motor cortical stimulation to evoke kinematic changes (less than 50 ms in Graziano et al., 2002Graziano M.S.A. Taylor C.S.R. Moore T. Complex movements evoked by microstimulation of precentral cortex.Neuron. 2002; 34: 841-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, Graziano et al., 2005Graziano M.S.A. Aflalo T.N. Cooke D.F. Arm movements evoked by electrical stimulation in the motor cortex of monkeys.J. Neurophysiol. 2005; 94: 4209-4223Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This implies that feedback-related information reached the motor cortex fast enough that anatomically it could have (but did not) generate a kinematic output sooner. Second, monkey J and R’s (but not L’s) firing rate changes showed two distinct phases of increasing divergence from otherwise similar unperturbed trials’ time-varying firing rates. We speculate that these reflect an early transient “burst” of output-null activity, perhaps corresponding to the arrival of perturbation-related sensory information to the motor cortex, followed later by a ramping output-potent response corresponding to the corrective movement. In order to directly examine whether the early perturbation-evoked neural response cancelled out at the downstream readout as predicted by the output-null hypothesis, we need to partition this activity into output-potent and output-null components. Unfortunately, this cannot be done fully and precisely in these arm-controlled experiments, because it would require complete knowledge of the causal relationship between the motor cortex and all muscles. Nonetheless, we could estimate which dimensions of our neural data were output-potent and output-null by approximating a linear mapping, Warm, between measured neural population activity and hand kinematics. We are not suggesting that the relationship between motor cortical activity and muscles is purely linear (though it may be close; see Churchland et al., 2012Churchland M.M. Cunningham J.P.

How the brain generates movement.Neural Comput. 2012; 24: 289-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Rather, we are asking whether the output-null mechanism provides a way to sequester computations from the circuit’s output even within a simple linear readout model, without resorting to the additional computational opportunities afforded by nonlinearities. We fit Warm using firing rates and hand velocity data collected while the monkey performed an unperturbed radial 8 target task. Across datasets, this linear mapping captured from 56% to 63% of monkey J’s, 45% to 52% of L’s, and 49% to 55% of R’s velocity variance. Equipped with this linear mapping, we projected the cursor jump-evoked firing rate changes into putatively output-potent dimensions (the row space of Warm) and putatively output-null dimensions (the null space of Warm). Figure 2D shows the neural response dynamics partitioned into these two orthogonal neural subspaces. Output-null responses consistently began before output-potent responses, leading by 28 ms (J jump at 6 cm), 62 ms (J jump during hold), 13 ms (L jump at 6 cm), 45 ms (L jump during hold), and 50 ms (R jump at 3–4 cm). The aforementioned initial response transients were indeed largely confined to output-null dimensions. This also demonstrates that the earliest motor cortical perturbation responses differed from the later responses in an important way: they avoided the putatively output-potent neural dimensions that were highly modulated during the later corrective movements. These results suggest that motor cortical dynamics transition from an initially output-null to a subsequently output-potent response following visual perturbations of natural arm movements. But to more convincingly show that feedback-related dynamics unfold as predicted by the output-null hypothesis, we needed to more accurately identify the output-potent and output-null neural dimensions during a closed-loop motor task. This motivated a set of BMI experiments, described below, which sacrifice having “natural” reaching behavior in exchange for allowing us to accurately and completely partition neural activity into output-potent and output-null components. Monkeys J and L performed a BMI variant of the cursor jump task in which the cursor was now directly controlled with motor cortical activity using a “ReFIT” velocity Kalman filter, without accompanying arm movement (Figure 3A). Decoders were initially seeded from automated cursor movement observation and then updated from closed-loop BMI data (Gilja et al., 2012Gilja V. Nuyujukian P. Chestek C.A. Cunningham J.P. Yu B.M. Fan J.M. Churchland M.M. Kaufman M.T. Kao J.C. Ryu S.I. Shenoy K.V. A high-performance neural prosthesis enabled by control algorithm design.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 1752-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). There were two additional jump event types: jump at 3 cm and jump at 10 cm. The four event types were intermixed during each session and probed perturbation responses during a variety of movement phases (Figure 3C). No additional training was needed for these monkeys (who had years of BMI experience) to adjust to the cursor jump task. Figure 3B shows both perturbed and unperturbed cursor trajectories from a representative dataset. We observed similar behavior in the arm-controlled and BMI-controlled tasks, suggesting that the latter is a reasonable and relevant experimental paradigm for dissecting neural dynamics following perturbations during motor control. Much like the kinematic responses following jumps mid-arm reach, BMI-controlled cursor trajectories following jumps at 3 cm and 6 cm initially continued along the task axis and then, after a delay, curved toward the target. Shortly after jumps during hold, the BMI cursor headed back toward the target, similar to the trajectories following jumps during arm-controlled target hold. Jump at 10-cm corrections were intermediate between mid-movement and hold period responses. We draw attention to the high quality of BMI control, which enabled quick and direct movements to the targets and suggests that the BMI cursor was a fairly precisely controlled motor effector. BMI cursor jump task success rates on individual datasets ranged from 99.0% to 99.9% in monkey J and 96.0% to 99.2% in monkey L. Cursor jumps substantially increased times to target (Figure 3D). Monkey J’s increase, compared to unperturbed trials, ranged from 16% (jump after 3 cm) to 58% (jump during hold). Monkey L’s increase ranged from 19% to 59%. Larger increases for later jump events were not surprising, because the task geometry allows for a shorter overall trajectory following earlier jumps. As was the case for the arm-controlled task, we observed minimal BMI cursor jump task performance improvement over the course of these experiments (Figure S1B). The experimenters’"

Feedforward and feedback connections propagate information between areas in opposite directions, but their functional roles are only partially understood. We used electrical microstimulation to perturb the propagation of neuronal activity between areas V1 and V4 in monkeys performing a texture-segregation task. In both areas, microstimulation locally caused a brief phase of excitation, followed by inhibition. Both these effects propagated faithfully in the feedforward direction from V1 to V4. Stimulation of V4, however, caused little V1 excitation, but it did yield a delayed suppression during the late phase of visually driven activity. This suppression was pronounced for the V1 figure representation and weaker for background representations. Our results reveal functional differences between feedforward and feedback processing in texture segregation and suggest a specific modulating role for feedback connections in perceptual organization."

This fundamental biological event depends on the species-specific interaction between rapidly evolving counterpart molecules on the gametes. We report biochemical, crystallographic, and mutational studies of domain repeats 1-3 of invertebrate egg coat protein VERL and their interaction with cognate sperm protein lysin. VERL repeats fold like the functionally essential N-terminal repeat of mammalian sperm receptor ZP2, whose structure is also described here. Whereas sequence-divergent repeat 1 does not bind lysin, repeat 3 binds it non-species specifically via a high-affinity, largely hydrophobic interface. Due to its intermediate binding affinity, repeat 2 selectively interacts with lysin from the same species. Exposure of a highly positively charged surface of VERL-bound lysin suggests that complex formation both disrupts the organization of egg coat filaments and triggers their electrostatic repulsion, thereby opening a hole for sperm penetration and fusion."

Grid cells in medial entorhinal cortex are an attractive model system for addressing this question, as the computation they perform is clear: they convert synaptic inputs into spatially modulated, periodic firing. Whether active dendrites contribute to the generation of the dual temporal and rate codes characteristic of grid cell output is unknown. We show that dendrites of medial entorhinal cortex neurons are highly excitable and exhibit a supralinear input-output function in vitro, while in vivo recordings reveal membrane potential signatures consistent with recruitment of active dendritic conductances. By incorporating these nonlinear dynamics into grid cell models, we show that they can sharpen the precision of the temporal code and enhance the robustness of the rate code, thereby supporting a stable, accurate representation of space under varying environmental conditions. Our results suggest that active dendrites may therefore constitute a key cellular mechanism for ensuring reliable spatial navigation."

(As) Cpf1 orthologs have RNase activities that can excise multiple CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) from a single RNA polymerase II-driven RNA transcript expressed in mammalian cells. This property simplifies modification of multiple genomic targets and can be used to increase the efficiency of Cpf1-mediated editing.
https://openalex.org/W2625601114,"AFM is used to show that curli, the functional amyloid fibrils generated by bacteria, form by polar growth from a one-step nucleation of monomers into minimal fibril units without transitioning through an intermediate, non-amyloid oligomeric state. Curli are functional amyloids produced by proteobacteria like Escherichia coli as part of the extracellular matrix that holds cells together into biofilms. The molecular events that occur during curli nucleation and fiber extension remain largely unknown. Combining observations from curli amyloidogenesis in bulk solutions with real-time in situ nanoscopic imaging at the single-fiber level, we show that curli display polar growth, and we detect two kinetic regimes of fiber elongation. Single fibers exhibit stop-and-go dynamics characterized by bursts of steady-state growth alternated with periods of stagnation. At high subunit concentrations, fibers show constant, unperturbed burst growth. Curli follow a one-step nucleation process in which monomers contemporaneously fold and oligomerize into minimal fiber units that have growth characteristics identical to those of the mature fibrils. Kinetic data and interaction studies of curli fibrillation in the presence of the natural inhibitor CsgC show that the inhibitor binds curli fibers and predominantly acts at the level of fiber elongation."

Here, our examination of the contributions of the central catecholaminergic (CA) neuronal system to this adaptive response revealed that CA neurons in the ventrolateral medulla (VLM) control stress-induced hyperglycemia. Ablation of VLM CA neurons abolished the hyperglycemic response to both physical and psychological stress, whereas chemogenetic activation of these neurons was sufficient to induce hyperglycemia. We further found that CA neurons in the rostral VLM, but not those in the caudal VLM, cause hyperglycemia via descending projections to the spinal cord. Monosynaptic tracing experiments showed that VLM CA neurons receive direct inputs from multiple stress-responsive brain areas. Optogenetic studies identified an excitatory PVN-VLM circuit that induces hyperglycemia. This study establishes the central role of VLM CA neurons in stress-induced hyperglycemia and substantially expands our understanding of the central mechanism that controls glucose metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2655582795,"During epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) progression, intraperitoneally disseminating tumor cells and multicellular aggregates (MCAs) present in ascites fluid adhere to the peritoneum and induce retraction of the peritoneal mesothelial monolayer prior to invasion of the collagen-rich submesothelial matrix and proliferation into macro-metastases. Clinical studies have shown heterogeneity among EOC metastatic units with respect to cadherin expression profiles and invasive behavior; however, the impact of distinct cadherin profiles on peritoneal anchoring of metastatic lesions remains poorly understood. In the current study, we demonstrate that metastasis-associated behaviors of ovarian cancer cells and MCAs are influenced by cellular cadherin composition. Our results show that mesenchymal N-cadherin-expressing (Ncad+) cells and MCAs invade much more efficiently than E-cadherin-expressing (Ecad+) cells. Ncad+ MCAs exhibit rapid lateral dispersal prior to penetration of three-dimensional collagen matrices. When seeded as individual cells, lateral migration and cell–cell junction formation precede matrix invasion. Neutralizing the Ncad extracellular domain with the monoclonal antibody GC-4 suppresses lateral dispersal and cell penetration of collagen gels. In contrast, use of a broad-spectrum matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor (GM6001) to block endogenous membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) activity does not fully inhibit cell invasion. Using intact tissue explants, Ncad+ MCAs were also shown to efficiently rupture peritoneal mesothelial cells, exposing the submesothelial collagen matrix. Acquisition of Ncad by Ecad+ cells increased mesothelial clearance activity but was not sufficient to induce matrix invasion. Furthermore, co-culture of Ncad+ with Ecad+ cells did not promote a ‘leader–follower’ mode of collective cell invasion, demonstrating that matrix remodeling and creation of invasive micro-tracks are not sufficient for cell penetration of collagen matrices in the absence of Ncad. Collectively, our data emphasize the role of Ncad in intraperitoneal seeding of EOC and provide the rationale for future studies targeting Ncad in preclinical models of EOC metastasis."

Although gain-of-functions by mutant p53 have been demonstrated experimentally, the precise mechanism for malignant progression in in vivo tumors remains unsolved. We generated ApcΔ716 Trp53LSL•R270H villin-CreER compound mice, in which mutant p53R270H was expressed in the intestinal epithelia upon tamoxifen treatment, and examined the intestinal tumor phenotypes and tumor-derived organoids. Mutant Trp53R270H, but not Trp53-null mutation accelerated submucosal invasion with generation of desmoplastic microenvironment. The nuclear accumulation of p53 was evident in ApcΔ716 Trp53R270H/R270H homozygous tumors like human CRC. Although p53 was distributed to the cytoplasm in ApcΔ716 Trp53+/R270H heterozygous tumors, it accumulated in the nuclei at the invasion front, suggesting a regulation mechanism for p53 localization by the microenvironment. Importantly, mutant p53 induced drastic morphological changes in the tumor organoids to complex glandular structures, which was associated with the acquisition of invasiveness. Consistently, the branching scores of human CRC that carry TP53 mutations at codon 273 significantly increased in comparison with those of TP53 wild-type tumors. Moreover, allografted ApcΔ716 Trp53R270H/R270H organoid tumors showed a malignant histology with an increased number of myofibroblasts in the stroma. These results indicate that nuclear-accumulated mutant p53R270H induces malignant progression of intestinal tumors through complex tumor gland formation and acquisition of invasiveness. Furthermore, RNA sequencing analyses revealed global gene upregulation by mutant p53R270H, which was associated with the activation of inflammatory and innate immune pathways. Accordingly, it is possible that mutant p53R270H induces CRC progression, not only by a cell intrinsic mechanism, but also by the generation or activation of the microenvironment, which may synergistically contribute to the acceleration of submucosal invasion. Therefore, the present study indicates that nuclear-accumulated mutant p53R270H is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of advanced CRCs."

Gene Set Enrichment Analysis suggests that miR-20a expression negatively correlates with the autophagy/lysosome pathway. We report here that miR-20a inhibits the basal and nutrient starvation-induced autophagic flux and lysosomal proteolytic activity, increases intracellular reactive oxygen species levels and DNA damage response by targeting several key regulators of autophagy, including BECN1, ATG16L1 and SQSTM1. Re-introduction of exogenous BECN1, ATG16L1 or SQSTM1 reverses the inhibitory effect of miR-20a on autophagy and decreases DNA damage. A negative correlation between miR-20a and its target genes is observed in breast cancer tissues. Lower levels of BECN1, ATG16L1 and SQSTM1 are more common in triple-negative cancers than in other subtypes. High levels of miR-20a also associate with higher frequency of copy-number alterations and DNA mutations in breast cancer patients. Further studies in a xenograft mouse model show that miR-20a promotes tumor initiation and tumor growth. Collectively, these findings suggest that miR-20a-mediated autophagy defect might be a new mechanism underlying the oncogenic function of miRNA during breast tumorigenesis."

Here, we generated a novel kidney fibrotic mouse model of persistent EGFR activation by selectively expressing the EGFR ligand, human heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (hHB-EGF), in renal proximal tubule epithelium. hHB-EGF expression increased tyrosine kinase phosphorylation of EGFR and the subsequent activation of downstream signaling pathways, including ERK and AKT, as well as the profibrotic TGF-β1/SMAD pathway. Epithelial-specific activation of EGFR was sufficient to promote spontaneous and progressive renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis, as characterized by increased collagen deposition, immune cell infiltration, and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA)–positive myofibroblasts. Tubule-specific EGFR activation promoted epithelial dedifferentiation and cell-cycle arrest. Furthermore, EGFR activation in epithelial cells promoted the proliferation of α-SMA+ myofibroblasts in a paracrine manner. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity or downstream MEK activity attenuated the fibrotic phenotype. This study provides definitive evidence that sustained activation of EGFR in proximal epithelia is sufficient to cause spontaneous, progressive renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis, evident by epithelial dedifferentiation, increased myofibroblasts, immune cell infiltration, and increased matrix deposition.—Overstreet, J.

In vitro reconstitution of the redox relay revealed a role for the Yap1-binding protein Ybp1 in promoting the formation of a ternary complex with Orp1 and Yap1 to enable redox transfer. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Yap1 regulates an H2O2-inducible transcriptional response that controls cellular H2O2 homeostasis. H2O2 activates Yap1 by oxidation through the intermediary of the thiol peroxidase Orp1. Upon reacting with H2O2, Orp1 catalytic cysteine oxidizes to a sulfenic acid, which then engages into either an intermolecular disulfide with Yap1, leading to Yap1 activation, or an intramolecular disulfide that commits the enzyme into its peroxidatic cycle. How the first of these two competing reactions, which is kinetically unfavorable, occurs was previously unknown. We show that the Yap1-binding protein Ybp1 brings together Orp1 and Yap1 into a ternary complex that selectively activates condensation of the Orp1 sulfenylated cysteine with one of the six Yap1 cysteines while inhibiting Orp1 intramolecular disulfide formation. We propose that Ybp1 operates as a scaffold protein and as a sulfenic acid chaperone to provide specificity in the transfer of oxidizing equivalents by a reactive sulfenic acid species."

Genome-wide association studies have identified associations between body mass index and two loci near cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1) and cell adhesion molecule 2 (CADM2), which encode membrane proteins that mediate synaptic assembly. We found that these respective risk variants associate with increased CADM1 and CADM2 expression in the hypothalamus of human subjects. Expression of both genes was elevated in obese mice, and induction of Cadm1 in excitatory neurons facilitated weight gain while exacerbating energy expenditure. Loss of Cadm1 protected mice from obesity, and tract-tracing analysis revealed Cadm1-positive innervation of POMC neurons via afferent projections originating from beyond the arcuate nucleus. Reducing Cadm1 expression in the hypothalamus and hippocampus promoted a negative energy balance and weight loss.

https://openalex.org/W2625829283,"In calmodulin (CaM)-rich environments, oncogenic KRAS plays a critical role in adenocarcinomas by promoting PI3K/Akt signaling. We previously proposed that at elevated calcium levels in cancer, CaM recruits PI3Kα to the membrane and extracts K-Ras4B from the membrane, organizing a K-Ras4B–CaM–PI3Kα ternary complex. CaM can thereby replace a missing receptor-tyrosine kinase signal to fully activate PI3Kα. Recent experimental data show that CaM selectively promotes K-Ras signaling but not of N-Ras or H-Ras. How CaM specifically targets K-Ras and how it extracts it from the membrane in KRAS-driven cancer is unclear. Obtaining detailed structural information for a CaM–K-Ras complex is still challenging. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations and fluorescence experiments, we observed that CaM preferentially binds unfolded K-Ras4B hypervariable regions (HVRs) and not α-helical HVRs. The interaction involved all three CaM domains including the central linker and both lobes. CaM specifically targeted the highly polybasic anchor region of the K-Ras4B HVR that stably wraps around CaM's acidic linker. The docking of the farnesyl group to the hydrophobic pockets located at both CaM lobes further enhanced CaM–HVR complex stability. Both CaM and K-Ras4B HVR are highly flexible molecules, suggesting that their interactions permit highly dynamic flexible-body motions. We, therefore, anticipate that the flexible-body interaction is required to extract K-Ras4B from the membrane, as conformational plasticity enables CaM to orient efficiently to the polybasic HVR anchor, which is partially diffused into the liquid-phase membrane. Our structural model of the CaM–K-Ras4B HVR association provides plausible clues to CaM's regulatory action in PI3Kα activation involving the ternary complex in cell proliferation signaling by oncogenic K-Ras."

Luciferase reporter assay was used to confirm the binding of miR16 to 3′-UTR of its target genes. The effects of miR16 on malignant behaviors were investigated, including tumor cell viability, soft-agar colony formation, GSCs Matrigel colony forming and migration and invasion as well as nude mice xenograft model.

Changes of miR16 targeted genes, Bcl2 (B cell lymphoma 2), CDK6 (Cyclin-dependent kinase 6), CCND1 (cyclin D1), CCNE1 (cyclin E1) and SOX5 were confirmed in glioblastoma cell lines and tissue specimens. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that tumor cell proliferation was inhibited by miR16 mimic, but enhanced by miR16 inhibitor. The expression level of miR16 positively correlates with GSCs differentiation, but negatively with the abilities of migration, motility, invasion and colony formation in glioblastoma cells.

However, the role of MKK3 beyond p38-signaling remains elusive. Recently, we reported a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of cancer-associated genes, termed OncoPPi, as a resource for the scientific community to generate new biological models. Analysis of the OncoPPi connectivity identified MKK3 as one of the major hub proteins in the network. Here, we show that MKK3 interacts with a large number of proteins critical for cell growth and metabolism, including the major oncogenic driver MYC. Multiple complementary approaches were used to demonstrate the direct interaction of MKK3 with MYC in vitro and in vivo. Computational modeling and experimental studies mapped the interaction interface to the MYC helix-loop-helix domain and a novel 15-residue MYC-binding motif in MKK3 (MBM). The MBM in MKK3 is distinct from the known binding sites for p38 or upstream kinases. Functionally, MKK3 stabilized MYC protein, enhanced its transcriptional activity and increased expression of MYC-regulated genes. The defined MBM peptide mimicked the MKK3 effect in promoting MYC activity. Together, the exploration of OncoPPi led to a new biological model in which MKK3 operates by two distinct mechanisms in cellular regulation through its phosphorylation of p38 and its activation of MYC through PPI."
https://openalex.org/W2626667474,"Alzheimer disease is associated with deposition of the amyloidogenic peptide Aβ in the brain. Passive immunization using Aβ-specific antibodies has been demonstrated to reduce amyloid deposition both in vitro and in vivo. Because N-terminally truncated pyroglutamate (pE)-modified Aβ species (AβpE3) exhibit enhanced aggregation potential and propensity to form toxic oligomers, they represent particularly attractive targets for antibody therapy. Here we present three separate monoclonal antibodies that specifically recognize AβpE3 with affinities of 1–10 nm and inhibit AβpE3 fibril formation in vitro. In vivo application of one of these resulted in improved memory in AβpE3 oligomer-treated mice. Crystal structures of Fab-AβpE3 complexes revealed two distinct binding modes for the peptide. Juxtaposition of pyroglutamate pE3 and the F4 side chain (the “pEF head”) confers a pronounced bulky hydrophobic nature to the AβpE3 N terminus that might explain the enhanced aggregation properties of the modified peptide. The deep burial of the pEF head by two of the antibodies explains their high target specificity and low cross-reactivity, making them promising candidates for the development of clinical antibodies.

Thus, we assessed the in vivo efficacy of induced pluripotent stem cell and mesenchymoangioblast-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MCA-MSCs) on AWR in a murine model of chronic allergic airways disease (AAD)/asthma. Female Balb/c mice were subjected to a 9-wk model of ovalbumin (Ova)-induced chronic AAD and treated intravenously or intranasally with MCA-MSCs from weeks 9 to 11. Changes in airway inflammation (AI), AWR, and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) were assessed. Ova-injured mice presented with AI, goblet cell metaplasia, epithelial thickening, increased airway TGF-β1 levels, subepithelial myofibroblast and collagen accumulation, total lung collagen concentration, and AHR (all P < 0.001 vs. uninjured control group). Apart from epithelial thickness, all other parameters measured were significantly, although not totally, decreased by intravenous delivery of MCA-MSCs to Ova-injured mice. In comparison, intranasal delivery of MCA-MSCs to Ova-injured mice significantly decreased all parameters measured (all P < 0.05 vs. Ova group) and, most notably, normalized aberrant airway TGF-β1 levels, airway/lung fibrosis, and AHR to values measured in uninjured animals. MCA-MSCs also increased collagen-degrading gelatinase levels. Hence, direct delivery of MCA-MSCs offers great therapeutic benefit for the AWR and AHR associated with chronic AAD.-Royce, S.

https://openalex.org/W2625054284,"Protein kinase Cβ (PKCβ) is a serine-threonine kinase associated with obesity and diabetic complications; its activation contributes to weight gain, and deletion of its gene results in resistance to genetic- and diet-induced obesity. Fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) protein is a recently identified RNA demethylase, and its overexpression in mice leads to increased body weight as well as fat mass. Although sharing some features in anabolism regulation, PKCβ and FTO have not been investigated together; therefore, their relationship has not been established. We report that PKCβ positively regulates FTO on the posttranslation level, evidenced by the facts that PKCβ activation contributes to high-glucose-induced FTO up-regulation, and overexpression of PKCβ suppresses ubiquitin-proteasome degradation of FTO, whereas PKCβ inactivation acts in the opposite manner. It was also found that PKCβ can phosphorylate FTO on threonine, and this phosphorylation requires both catalytic and regulatory domains of PKCβ. Moreover, PKCβ inhibition can suppress 3T3-L1 cell differentiation in normal and FTO-overexpressing cells but not in FTO-silenced or -inhibited cells. We propose that PKCβ acts to suppress the degradation of FTO protein and reveals the associated role of PKCβ and FTO in adipogenesis, suggesting a new pathway that affects the development of obesity and metabolic diseases.-Tai, H., Wang, X., Zhou, J., Han, X., Fang, T., Gong, H., Huang, N., Chen, H., Qin, J., Yang, M., Wei, X., Yang, L., Xiao, H.

https://openalex.org/W2626560129,"Ion exchange in the renal tubules is fundamental to the maintenance of physiological ion levels. Claudin-16 (CLDN16) regulates the paracellular reabsorption of Mg2+ in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop in the kidney, with dephosphorylation of CLDN16 increasing its intracellular distribution and decreasing paracellular Mg2+ permeability. CLDN16 is located in the tight junctions, but the mechanism regulating its localization is unclear. Using yeast two-hybrid systems, we found that CLDN16 binds to PDZRN3, a protein containing both RING-finger and PDZ domains. We also observed that the carboxyl terminus of the cytoplasmic CLDN16 region was required for PDZRN3 binding. PZDRN3 was mainly distributed in the cytosol of rat kidney cells and upon cell treatment with the protein kinase A inhibitor H-89, colocalized with CLDN16. H-89 also increased mono-ubiquitination and the association of CLDN16 with PDZRN3. Mono-ubiquitination levels of a K275A mutant were lower, and its association with PDZRN3 was reduced compared with wild-type (WT) CLDN16 and a K261A mutant, indicating that Lys-275 is the major ubiquitination site.

In the distal tubule, Mg2+ is reabsorbed via a transcellular pathway. Transient receptor potential melastatin 6 channel is expressed in the apical membrane of the distal tubule and transports Mg2+ from the lumen into the cells (3.Schlingmann K.P. Weber S. Peters M.

The permeability to ions via paracellular pathway is controlled by tight junctions (TJs). The TJ barrier contains aqueous channels capable of discriminating charge and molecular size, and its electrical resistance varies among different epithelia (5.Powell D.W.

Claudins (CLDNs), a large family of transmembrane proteins, are major components of TJs and bear four transmembrane domains with cytoplasmic amino and carboxyl termini (7.Morita K. Furuse M.

The carboxyl terminus of most CLDNs has a PDZ-binding motif that can interact with the PDZ domain of scaffolding proteins including zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1), ZO-2, and ZO-3. ZO-1 and ZO-2 indirectly link CLDNs to the actin cytoskeleton, and these junctional complexes are necessary to maintain the characteristics of permeability. Familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis is a renal Mg2+ and Ca2+ wasting disorder caused by mutation in the CLDN16 or CLDN19 gene, resulting in impaired renal function and renal failure (9.Simon D.B.

We previously reported that CLDN16 is dephosphorylated in Dahl salt-sensitive hypertensive rats (16.Ikari A. Matsumoto S. Harada H. Takagi K. Degawa M. Takahashi T. Sugatani J. Miwa M. Dysfunction of paracellin-1 by dephosphorylation in Dahl salt-sensitive hypertensive rats.J. Physiol.

Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1781-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The mistargeting of CLDN16 must be a cause of hypomagnesemia; however, the regulatory mechanisms for trafficking of CLDN16 have not yet been clarified in detail. PDZ domains are structural motifs that bind to a consensus motif at the carboxyl terminus of target proteins. A member of PDZ domain containing RING finger (PDZRN) includes a RING finger domain at an amino terminus and two or four PDZ domains at the carboxyl terminus. PDZRN3 has been reported to play positive roles in the myoblast differentiation (18.Ko J.A. Kimura Y. Matsuura K. Yamamoto H. Gondo T. Inui M. PDZRN3 (LNX3, SEMCAP3) is required for the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into myotubes.J.

In contrast, it has negative roles in the bone morphogenetic protein-2-induced osteoblast differentiation (20.Honda T. Yamamoto H. Ishii A. Inui M.

However, the functional characterization and binding target proteins of PDZRN3 have not been clarified in the mammalian kidney. In the present study we investigated the novel association protein, which can regulate trafficking of CLDN16. In yeast two-hybrid systems, PDZRN3 was identified to bind to CLDN16. Immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation assays showed that PDZRN3 is expressed in the CLDN16-expressing cells and binds to CLDN16 in the rat renal tubule. N-[2-(p-Bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide (H-89), a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, increased the association of CLND16 with PDZRN3 in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells expressing FLAG-tagged CLDN16. PDZRN3 siRNA suppressed endocytosis and increased the cell-surface expression of CLDN16 in the H-89-treated cells. Furthermore, PDZRN3 siRNA increased paracellular Mg2+ flux from the apical to basal compartments. Similar results were observed in the cells expressing S217A mutant, a dephosphorylated form of CLDN16. Our present results indicate that PDZRN3 may be involved in the endocytosis of dephosphorylated CLDN16 from the TJs to intracellular compartments. To identify novel CLDN16-binding proteins involved in the regulation of its trafficking, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening using a human kidney cDNA library with the carboxyl cytoplasmic region of CLDN16 as bait. We obtained 234 positive clones and determined the sequences as described previously (22.Ikari A. Tonegawa C. Sanada A. Kimura T. Sakai H. Hayashi H. Hasegawa H. Yamaguchi M. Yamazaki Y. Endo S. Matsunaga T. Sugatani J. Tight junctional localization of claudin-16 is regulated by syntaxin 8 in renal tubular epithelial cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 13112-13123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Among them, we chose PDZRN3 (3 clones) as a candidate protein involved in regulating the trafficking of CLDN16 in the present studies. CLDN16 was previously shown to be exclusively expressed in the TAL of Henle's loop in humans (9.Simon D.B. Lu Y. Choate K.A. Velazquez H. Al-Sabban E. Praga M. Casari G. Bettinelli A. Colussi G.

Gomes A.S. Yan Q. Paul D.L. Bleich M. Goodenough D.A. Transgenic RNAi depletion of claudin-16 and the renal handling of magnesium.J. Biol.

Restricted localization of claudin-16 at the tight junction in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop together with claudins 3, 4, and 10 in bovine nephrons.J. Vet. Med. Sci. 2006; 68: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the rat kidney, CLDN16 was localized in the cells expressing Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein (THP), a marker of the TAL (Fig. 1A). PDZRN3 was widely expressed in the renal tubules including CLDN16-positive cells. These results indicate that PDZRN3 may be associated with CLDN16 in the kidney. To clarify the association between CLDN16 and PDZRN3, we performed immunoprecipitation assay using the homogenates from rat renal cortex. PDZRN3 was immunoprecipitated with anti-CLDN16 antibody but not with rabbit IgG (Fig. 1B). To clarify the binding site of CLDN16 with PDZRN3, we made a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein to the carboxyl cytoplasmic region of wild type (WT) and ΔPDZ mutant, a deletion form of the PDZ-binding motif (TRV at the carboxyl terminus) of CLDN16. In the pulldown assay, the WT CLDN16 was associated with PDZRN3, but ΔPDZ mutant was not (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that CLDN16 binds to PDZRN3 through the PDZ-binding motif. We previously established stable cells expressing FLAG-tagged CLDN16 using MDCK/Tet-off cell line (25.Ikari A. Ito M. Okude C. Sawada H. Harada H. Degawa M. Sakai H. Takahashi T. Sugatani J. Miwa M. Claudin-16 is directly phosphorylated by protein kinase A independently of a vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein-mediated pathway.J. Cell Physiol. 2008; 214: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The induction of CLDN16 by removal of doxycycline was confirmed by immunoblotting using anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 2A). The expression levels of endogenous junctional protein including ZO-1, PDZRN3, E-cadherin, and occludin were not changed by CLDN16 expression. CLDN16 was not associated with PDZRN3 under control conditions, but H-89, a PKA inhibitor, increased the association between CLDN16 and PDZRN3 (Fig. 2B). The expression levels of PDZRN3 were not changed by the expression of mock, WT, and ΔPDZ mutant CLDN16 in the presence of H-89 (Fig. 2C). WT CLDN16 was associated with PDZRN3 in the presence of H-89, which was inhibited by the deletion of the PDZ-binding motif of CLDN16. These results indicate that the PDZ-binding motif within the carboxyl cytoplasmic region of CLDN16 is involved in the interaction with PDZRN3, consistent with the data of the pulldown assay. Immunofluorescence assay showed that CLDN16 is colocalized with ZO-1 in the TJs, whereas it is not colocalized with Rab7, a late endosome marker, in the cytosol under control conditions (Fig. 3A). PDZRN3 was mainly distributed in the cytosol and slightly in the cell-cell contact area. H-89 increased the cytosolic distribution of CLDN16 and the colocalization of CLDN16 with PDZRN3 or Rab7 (Fig. 3, B and F). The colocalization of early endosomal antigen 1 (EEA1), an early endosome marker, with CLDN16 was slightly increased by H-89, whereas that with PDZRN3 was not (Fig. 3, C and D). The colocalization of CLDN16 with Rab7 caused by H-89 was inhibited by the introduction of PDZRN3 siRNA (Fig. 3, E and F). These results indicate that PDZRN3 may be involved in the regulation of intracellular trafficking of dephosphorylated CLDN16. Western blotting showed that the bands of FLAG-tagged CLDN16 are detected around 28 kDa in the short-exposure point (Fig. 4). In the long-exposure point, another band was detected around 36 kDa. The total levels of PDZRN3 and upper bands of CLDN16 were decreased by the introduction of PDZRN3 siRNA, whereas those of CLDN1 and the lower bands of CLDN16 were not. The cell-surface biotinylation assay has been used to examine the cell-surface localization of CLDN1, CLDN2, and CLDN4 in MDCK cells (26.Ikari A. Takiguchi A. Atomi K. Sugatani J.

The level of cell-surface localization of CLDN16 in the H-89-treated cells was significantly lower than that in the control cells. PDZRN3 siRNA inhibited the H-89-induced reduction of cell-surface localization of CLDN16. In contrast, the cell-surface localization of CLDN1 was not changed by H-89 and PDZRN3 siRNA. Next, we examined the effect of PDZRN3 on ubiquitination of CLDN16. H-89 increased mono-ubiquitination level of CLDN16 and the association of CLDN16 with PDZRN3, which were inhibited by the introduction of PDZRN3 siRNA. The bands of CLDN16 were detected around 36 kDa, which is similar to the size of ubiquitin-conjugated CLDN16. In contrast, CLDN1 was not associated with PDZRN3 in the control, H-89-treated, and PDZRN3 siRNA-transfected cells. Ubiquitination sites are predicted at Lys-261 and Lys-275 of human CLDN16 by the bioinformatics tool of CKSAAP_UbSite. Alanine substitution assay showed that the high molecular weight band of CLDN16 is decreased, and the low molecular weight band is increased by the mutation at K275A in the presence of H-89 (Fig. 5A). Total levels of PDZRN3 and CLDN16 were not changed by the mutation at K261A and K275A. The ubiquitination and association of PDZRN3 with CLDN16 were significantly inhibited by the mutation at Lys-275 but not at Lys-261 (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that Lys-275 of CLDN16 may be a major ubiquitination site. The association between CLDN16 and PDZRN3 may increase the trafficking of CLDN16 from the TJs to subcellular compartments. Therefore, we examined the effect of PDZRN3 siRNA on the endocytosis of CLDN16. CLDN16 was time-dependently internalized in the presence of H-89, which was suppressed by the knockdown of PDZRN3 (Fig. 6A). These results indicate that PDZRN3 may be involved in the endocytosis of dephosphorylated CLDN16 from the TJs to subcellular compartments. Next, we examined the effect of PDZRN3 on the protein stability of CLDN16. The levels of WT CLDN16 were time-dependently decreased in the presence of cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, and H-89 (Fig. 6B). The rate of decrease was significantly inhibited by the introduction of PDZRN3 siRNA. These results indicate that PDZRN3 has an effect on the protein stability of CLDN16 in the presence of H-89. We previously reported that the tight junctional localization of CLDN16 is regulated by its phosphorylation at Ser-217 (17.Ikari A. Matsumoto S. Harada H. Takagi K. Hayashi H. Suzuki Y. Degawa M. Miwa M. Phosphorylation of paracellin-1 at Ser-217 by protein kinase A is essential for localization in tight junctions.J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1781-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). S217A mutant, a dephosphorylated form of CLDN16, was mainly distributed in the cytosol and colocalized with PDZRN3 or Rab7 (Fig. 7, A and C). The association levels of CLDN16 with PDZRN3 and mono-ubiquitination of S217A mutant were higher than those of WT. In contrast, the level of cell-surface localization of S217A mutant was lower than that of WT. These results are similar to those in H-89-treated cells (Figure 3, Figure 4). PDZRN3 siRNA increased the tight junctional localization of S217A mutant and colocalization between CLDN16 and ZO-1, whereas it decreased the co-localization between CLDN16 and Rab7 (Fig. 7, B and C). PDZRN3 siRNA increased the cell-surface localization of CLDN16, whereas it decreased mono-ubiquitination and the association with CLDN16. These results indicate that PDZRN3 is involved in the cytosolic retention of dephosphorylated CLDN16. Next, we examined the effect of PDZRN3 siRNA on the protein stability of S217A mutant CLDN16. The levels of S217A mutant CLDN16 were time-dependently decreased in the presence of cycloheximide, which were significantly inhibited by the introduction of PDZRN3 siRNA (Fig. 7D). These results are similar to those in the WT CLDN16-expressing cells treated with H-89. Induction of WT CLDN16 expression by removing doxycycline caused increases in transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and paracellular Mg2+ flux (Fig. 8, A and B). H-89 significantly inhibited the CLDN16-induced increase in TER and Mg2+ flux, which was rescued by PDZRN3 siRNA. Similarly, TER and Mg2+ flux were increased by PDZRN3 siRNA in the cells expressing S217A mutant CLDN16 (Fig. 8, C and D). These results indicate that dephosphorylation causes a loss of function of CLDN16 mediated by the mislocalization, which is rescued by PDZRN3 siRNA. A dysfunction of CLDN16 or 19 is involved in the pathogenesis of hypomagnesemia. More than 40 and 10 mutations, respectively, have been currently identified in CLDN16 and CLDN19 genes (29.Günzel D. Haisch L. Pfaffenbach S. Krug S.M. Milatz S. Amasheh S. Hunziker W. Müller D. Claudin function in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop.Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2009; 1165: 152-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Mutations in CLDN16 genes affect >28 different amino acids, which mainly occur in the extracellular loop and transmembrane domains. The mutants of CDLN16 distributed in the TJs have full or partial function after being transfected into LLC-PK1 (15.Hou J. Paul D.L. Goodenough D.A. Paracellin-1 and the modulation of ion selectivity of tight junctions.J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5109-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and MDCK-C7 cells (12.Kausalya P.J. Amasheh S. Günzel D. Wurps H. Müller D. Fromm M. Hunziker W. Disease-associated mutations affect intracellular traffic and paracellular Mg2+ transport function of Claudin-16.J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 878-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In contrast, the mutants mislocalized to the intracellular compartments including the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and lysosome lose their function. Therefore, the subcellular trafficking step of CLDN16 from intracellular compartments to the TJs plays an important role in the controlling Mg2+ reabsorption under physiological conditions. The intracellular localization of several CLDNs is regulated by phosphorylation. Phosphorylated CLDN1 and -2 are localized at the TJs in MDCK II cells (30.Fujii N. Matsuo Y. Matsunaga T. Endo S.

Hypotonic stress-induced down-regulation of claudin-1 and -2 mediated by dephosphorylation and clathrin-dependent endocytosis in renal tubular epithelial cells.J. Biol.

CLDN4 phosphorylated by atypical protein kinase C (PKC) is localized at the TJs in human keratinocyte cells (32.Aono S. Hirai Y. Phosphorylation of claudin-4 is required for tight junction formation in a human keratinocyte cell line.Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 3326-3339Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of CLDNs may be also involved in the pathogenesis. The phosphorylation status of CLDN4–7 was individually changed during the course of colitis caused by lipopolysaccharide in T84 colonic cells (33.Li J. Li Y.X. Chen M.H. Li J. Du J. Shen B. Xia X.M. Changes in the phosphorylation of claudins during the course of experimental colitis.Int. J. Clin. Exp. Pathol. 2015; 8: 12225-12233PubMed Google Scholar). Mislocalization of CLDN1 in the nuclei is caused by the PKC-dependent phosphorylation and increases metastasis in osteosarcoma cells (34.Jian Y. Chen C. Li B. Tian X. Delocalized claudin-1 promotes metastasis of human osteosarcoma cells.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2015; 466: 356-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In contrast, nuclear localization of CLDN2 is increased by dephosphorylation and enhances proliferation in lung adenocarcinoma cells (35.Ikari A. Watanabe R. Sato T. Taga S. Shimobaba S. Yamaguchi M. Yamazaki Y. Endo S. Matsunaga T. Sugatani J. Nuclear distribution of claudin-2 increases cell proliferation in human lung adenocarcinoma cells.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1843: 2079-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation levels of CLDN16 in Dahl salt-sensitive hypertensive rats is lower than that in normotensive rats, and dephosphorylated CLDN16 caused by H-89 treatment is mainly distributed in the cytosol (16.Ikari A. Matsumoto S. Harada H. Takagi K. Degawa M. Takahashi T. Sugatani J. Miwa M. Dysfunction of paracellin-1 by dephosphorylation in Dahl salt-sensitive hypertensive rats.J. Physiol. Sci. 2006; 56: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 25.Ikari A. Ito M. Okude C. Sawada H. Harada H. Degawa M. Sakai H. Takahashi T. Sugatani J. Miwa M. Claudin-16 is directly phosphorylated by protein kinase A independently of a vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein-mediated pathway.J. Cell Physiol. 2008; 214: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the elevation of extracellular Mg2+ concentration increased the intracellular localization of CLDN16 mediated by the activation of the MEK/ERK pathway. The regulatory factors and the effect of phosphorylation on the localization of CLDNs may be different in each CLDN and tissue. We recently reported that syntaxin-8, a target soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor, binds to CLDN16 (22.Ikari A. Tonegawa C. Sanada A. Kimura T. Sakai H. Hayashi H. Hasegawa H. Yamaguchi M. Yamazaki Y. Endo S. Matsunaga T. Sugatani J. Tight junctional localization of claudin-16 is regulated by syntaxin 8 in renal tubular epithelial cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 13112-13123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The association of CLDN16 with syntaxin-8 and the cell-surface localization of CLDN16 are decreased by H-89 treatment. Furthermore, the association of S217A-mutant CLDN16 with syntaxin-8 is lower than that of WT, and the mutant was mainly localized in the cytosol. Therefore, we suggested that trafficking of CLDN16 from the intracellular compartments t"

Escherichia coli DsbB is a transmembrane enzyme that catalyzes the reoxidation of the periplasmic oxidase DsbA by ubiquinone. Here, we sought to convert membrane-bound DsbB into a water-soluble biocatalyst by leveraging a previously described method for in vivo solubilization of integral membrane proteins (IMPs). When solubilized DsbB variants were coexpressed with an export-defective copy of DsbA in the cytoplasm of wild-type E. coli cells, artificial oxidation pathways were created that efficiently catalyzed de novo disulfide-bond formation in a range of substrate proteins, in a manner dependent on both DsbA and quinone. Hence, DsbB solubilization was achieved with preservation of both catalytic activity and substrate specificity. Moreover, given the generality of the solubilization technique, the results presented here should pave the way to unlocking the biocatalytic potential of other membrane-bound enzymes whose utility has been limited by poor stability of IMPs outside of their native lipid-bilayer context."
https://openalex.org/W2625563874,"Intersectins (ITSNs), an evolutionarily conserved adaptor protein family, have been implicated in multiple biologic processes; however, their functions in mammalian oocytes have not been addressed. Here, we report delayed meiotic resumption and defective cytokinesis upon specific depletion of ITSN2 in mouse oocytes. In particular, abnormal spindle, misaligned chromosomes, and loss of cortical actin cap are readily observed in ITSN2-depleted oocytes. Similarly, a small molecule that targets the Cdc42-ITSN interaction also disrupts oocyte maturation and actin polymerization. Moreover, we find that ITSN2 depletion reduces the activity of Cdc42 in oocytes and, of note, that forced expression of the dominant-positive mutant of Cdc42, in part, prevents the effects of ITSN2 knockdown on actin cap formation. In addition, the localization of WASP and Arp2, the downstream effector proteins of Cdc42, is altered in ITSN2-depleted oocytes accordingly. In summary, our data support a model in which ITSN2 depletion induces the inactivation of Cdc42, which, in turn, influences the distribution and function of Arp2/3 and WASP, consequently disrupting oocyte polarity establishment and meiotic division.-Zhang, J., Ma, R., Li, L., Wang, L., Hou, X., Han, L., Ge, J., Li, M., Wang, Q. Intersectin 2 controls actin cap formation and meiotic division in mouse oocytes through the Cdc42 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2900206456,"Transcription factors play crucial roles in patterning posterior neuroectoderm. Previously, zinc finger transcription factor znfl1 was reported to be expressed in the posterior neuroectoderm of zebrafish embryos. However, its roles remain unknown. Here, we report that there are 13 copies of znfl1 in the zebrafish genome, and all the paralogues share highly identical protein sequences and cDNA sequences. When znfl1s are knocked down using a morpholino to inhibit their translation or dCas9-Eve to inhibit their transcription, the zebrafish gastrula displays reduced expression of hoxb1b, the marker gene for the posterior neuroectoderm. Further analyses reveal that diminishing znfl1s produces the decreased expressions of pou5f3, whereas overexpression of pou5f3 effectively rescues the reduced expression of hoxb1b in the posterior neuroectoderm. Additionally, knocking down znfl1s causes the reduced expression of sall4, a direct regulator of pou5f3, in the posterior neuroectoderm, and overexpression of sall4 rescues the expression of pou5f3 in the knockdown embryos. In contrast, knocking down either pou5f3 or sall4 does not affect the expressions of znfl1s. Taken together, our results demonstrate that zebrafish znfl1s control the expression of hoxb1b in the posterior neuroectoderm by acting upstream of pou5f3 and sall4."
https://openalex.org/W2624956982,"During mitosis, a cell divides its duplicated genome into two identical daughter cells. This process must occur without errors to prevent proliferative diseases (e.g., cancer). A key mechanism controlling mitosis is the precise timing of more than 32,000 phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events by a network of kinases and counterbalancing phosphatases. The identity, magnitude, and temporal regulation of these events have emerged recently, largely from advances in mass spectrometry. Here, we show phosphoevents currently believed to be key regulators of mitosis. For an animated version of this SnapShot, please see http://www.cell.com/cell/enhanced/odonoghue2."
https://openalex.org/W2625406792,"Tumor blood vessels support tumor growth and progression. Centrosomes are microtubule organization centers in cells, and often up to 30% of tumor endothelial cells (ECs) acquire excess (>2) centrosomes. Although excess centrosomes can lead to aneuploidy and chromosome instability in tumor cells, how untransformed ECs respond to excess centrosomes is poorly understood. We found that the frequency of primary human ECs with excess centrosomes was quickly reduced in a p53-dependent manner. Excess centrosomes in ECs were associated with p53 phosphorylation at Ser33, increased p21 levels, and decreased cell proliferation and expression of senescence markers, but independent of DNA damage and apoptosis. Aspects of the senescence-associated phenotype were also observed in mouse ECs that were isolated from tumors with excess centrosomes. Primary ECs with excess centrosomes in vascular sprouts also had elevated Ser33 p53 phosphorylation and expressed senescence markers. Our work demonstrates that nontransformed ECs respond differently to excess centrosomes than do most tumor cells—they undergo senescence in vascular sprouts and vessels, which suggests that pathologic outcomes of centrosome overduplication depend on the transformation status of cells.—Yu, Z., Ruter, D.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying colorectal cancer liver metastasis remains unclear. Using a global and multidimensional integration approach, we studied sequencing data, protein-protein interactions, and regulation of transcription factor and non-coding RNAs in primary tumor samples and liver metastasis samples to unveil the potential bridging molecules and the regulators that functionally link different stages of colorectal cancer liver metastasis. Primary tumor samples and liver metastasis samples had modules with significant overlap and crosstalk from which we identified several bridging genes (e.g. KNG1 and COX5B), transcription factors (e.g. E2F4 and CDX2), microRNAs (e.g. miR-590-3p and miR-203) and lncRNAs (e.g. lincIRX5 and lincFOXF1) that may play an important role in the process of colorectal cancer liver metastasis. This study enhances our understanding of the genetic alterations and transcriptional regulation that drive the metastatic process, but also provides the methodology to guide the studies on other metastatic cancers."
