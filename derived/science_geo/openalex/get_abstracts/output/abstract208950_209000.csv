https://openalex.org/W2069200517,"Each of us is uniquely subject to certain kinds of stimulation from a small part of the universe within our skins. Mentalistic psychologies insist that other kinds of events, lacking the physical dimensions of stimuli, are accessible to the owner of the skin within which they occur. One solution often regarded as behavioristic, granting the distinction between public and private events and ruling the latter out of consideration, has not been successful. A science of behavior must face the problem of privacy by dealing with events within the skin in their relation to behavior, without assuming they have a special nature or must be known in a special way.The search for copies of the world within the body (e.g. the sensations and images of conscious content) has also had discouraging results. The organism does not create duplicates: Its seeing, hearing, smelling, and so on are forms of action rather than of reproduction. Seeing does not imply something seen. We know that when we dream of wolves, no wolves are actually there; it is harder to understand that not even representations of wolves are there.Mentalistic formulations create mental way stations. Where experimental analyses examine the effects of variables on behavior, mentalistic psychologies deal first with their effects on inferred entities such as feelings or expectations and then with the effects of these entities on behavior. Mental states thus seem to bridge gaps between dependent and independent variables, and mentalistic interpretations are particularly attractive when these are separated by long time periods. The practice confuses the order of events and leads to unfinished causal accounts."
https://openalex.org/W2073492025,"Ribosomes isolated from rat liver occur predominantly in the form of aggregates (ergosomes) corresponding to multiples of 73S particles held together by messenger RNA. After injecting rats with actinomycin, these aggregates gradually break down in vivo to 73S monomers and 113S dimers. We conclude that the observed breakdown results from the degradation of messenger RNA and the prevention by actinomycin of the synthesis of new messenger RNA."

https://openalex.org/W24244675,"Previous studies in this laboratory have demonstrated that the prior administration of L-thyroxine to animals in viva or its addition in vitro stimulates the rate of amino acid incorporation into microsomal protein in cell-free rat liver homogenates (3). Mitochondria and an oxidizable substrate were found to be essential requirements for the thyroxine effect in vitro; when these components of the system were replaced by a creatine phosphate-adenosine triphosphate-generating system, no thyroxine effects were observed. Current concepts of protein biosynthesis support the following abbreviated scheme for the incorporation of amino acids (AA) into microsomal protein (4, 5).l"

https://openalex.org/W2064087717,"Cats were trained to discriminate either between a horizontal and vertical rectangle or between two oblique rectangles, one at 45 degrees , the other at 135 degrees to horizontal. All animals were first trained with both shapes (one in each orientation) presented together, and then retrained with only one shape shown at a time. Throughout the experiment the animals being trained with oblique rectangles performed as well as those being trained with horizontal and vertical rectangles. This finding is in marked contrast with results obtained from other species. The results suggest that the ability of a species to discriminate between rectangles in different orientations may depend upon the relative numbers of cells in the visual system having receptive fields in each orientation."

The presence of material with group A activity in the virus itself is not proved. Commercial influenza virus vaccines which were tested contained non-dialyzable substances with group A activity. Injections of this nondialyzable material into human volunteers caused an increase in anti-human blood group A(1) and A(2) antibodies."

https://openalex.org/W2080136208,"The growth of chicks decreased, and specific abnormalities of hocks and feathers increased, when cadmium was added to a zinc-deficient diet. Supplementation of the diet with zinc prevented the adverse effect of cadmium on hock and feather development and partially offset the effect on growth. Changes in the gizzard lining, also resulting from cadmium ingestion, were partially prevented by increase in the zinc intake."
https://openalex.org/W2089270121,"THIN-LAYER chromatography offers many advantages over paper chromatography for the separation of biological compounds. While thin-layer chromatogram procedures are rapid and efficient, separations on glass plates do not allow scanning of the chromatograms on present equipment. Further, recommended methods for the removal of the thin layers from glass plates require additional work and are not satisfactory as spots may be distorted, backgrounds discoloured, and parts of the silica-gel layer lost due to adherence to the plate."

The tips of the tubes rotate freely in mercury-filled grooves connected to the recorder through stainless-steel screws. No attenuation or distortion of the signal appears on records obtained through the coupler.
https://openalex.org/W2045921301,"CEBTAIN bacteria in the logarithmic growth phase become non-viable when chilled in aqueous suspension. The phenomenon has been observed with strains of Escherichia coli1, Pseudomonas pyocyanea2 and Aerobacter aerogenes3. Loss of viability of logarithmic phase A. aerogenes suspended in chilled phosphate-saline is accompanied by the leakage of endogenous solutes, and the leakage products, in sufficient concentration, protect the bacteria against the lethal effect3. Thus, loss of viability is greater the sparser the population and is insignificant in chilled suspensions containing more than 5 × 109 organisms/ml. Correlation between loss of viability and leakage of endogenous solutes has now been obtained by observing the effects of chilling on three Gram-negative bacteria."

In addition to the known dimeric keto ether, two new products, compound A, a trimer, and compound B, an isomer of compound A, were ioslated. Ultraviolet and infrared absorption spectra and paper chromatography indicate that compound A might be identical with liver metabolite ""O"" which results from the addition of alpha-tocopherol to the diet."

These concentrated extracts, when introduced into an aquarium containing top smelt, induce a strong alarm reaction in the fish, characterized by rapid swimming, jumping, and often severe seizures. The fact that extracts from white surfperch, Phanerodon furcatus (Girard); surf smelt, Hypomesus pretiosus (Girard); northern anchovy, Engraulis mordox (Girard); or Pacific herring, Clupea pallasi (Valenciennes) caused only mild excitation in the top smelt indicates the species-specificity of the alarm reaction."
