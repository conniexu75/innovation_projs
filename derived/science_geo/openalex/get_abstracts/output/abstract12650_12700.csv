https://openalex.org/W1976750101,"TUMOUR-PROMOTING agents have been defined by their ability to promote tumour formation on carcinogen-initiated mouse skin. The most potent of these agents are the diesters of phorbol which are the active components of croton oil, the classic promoting substance. Phorbol esters can be chemically modified in a number of positions to form molecules with a wide range of promoter potency1. Such modifications have been useful in determining structure-function relationships2. A good correlation exists between the ability of phorbol esters to promote epidermal tumours and their ability to stimulate epidermal macro-molecular synthesis in vivo3,4. In particular, all tumour promoters stimulate synthesis of epidermal DNA, although not all chemicals which induce hyperplasia are promoters1. Recently O'Brien et al.5 suggested that the degree of induction of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity in mouse skin after application of promoting and non-promoting compounds correlates well with their promoting potency. Evidence from our laboratory indicates that brief exposure to the potent phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), stimulates DNA synthesis and ODC activity in mouse epidermal cell cultures (S.H.Y., T.B., E.P., D. Michael, K. Elgjo and H.H., to be published, and U.L. and S.H.Y., to be published). Using such a culture system, we have examined a series of phorbol esters to test the correlation of promoter potency in vivo with the stimulation of DNA synthesis and ODC activity in vitro."

https://openalex.org/W1979684411,"OUR recent hypothesis1 that “anorectic agents” such as fenfluramine and mazindol owe at least part of their anti-obesity properties to a peripheral action on glucose metabolism by causing an increase in glucose uptake into skeletal muscle and a subsequent “wasting of calories” has been criticised2 on the grounds that there is no information on the fate of the glucose so taken up, nor convincing evidence for an increase in metabolic rate with these drugs. We have now studied the effect of fenfluramine on lactate production in isolated human skeletal muscle, our previous work having shown no increase in glycogen levels3 nor in carbon dioxide production4. An increase in lactate production would indicate metabolism of the glucose entering the cell under the influence of fenfluramine."

https://openalex.org/W2019005511,"WE have1–3 described previously a paralytic disease observed in rabbits immunised with small doses, in Freund's complete adjuvant, of nicotinic cholinergic receptor protein (nAChR) isolated from the electric organ of Torpedo marmorata. Decremental muscle response after nerve stimulation and positive effects of anticholinesterase administration, decrease in miniature endplate potential amplitude and increased curare sensitivity were similar to findings in patients suffering from myasthenia gravis. Nicotinic AChR antibody titres above 2–3 mg ml−1 have been found, the observed muscle decrement increasing with increasing antibody titre. Occasionally, variations in electromyographic activity were observed, suggesting denervation. Morphological analysis3,4 showed severe destruction of postsynaptic motor endplate areas and reduction of toxin-binding sites, followed by changes at the presynaptic side. A second stage of the disease was characterised by high sensitivity to nAChR injections and by the presence of motor endplates lacking secondary postsynaptic foldings. Our work and that of others (for review see ref. 5) suggests that an immune response to nAChR seems to be involved in the aetiology of experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAM) just as is suggested for human myasthenia gravis. The role of a humoral and/or cellular immune response and that of the thymus are under discussion5,6. The decremental response to repetitive nerve stimulation may be caused directly and/or indirectly by nAChR antibodies, whereas defects in electromyographic activity such as high frequency discharges and fibrillation action potentials which we have observed may have been caused by other, accompanying mechanisms. This report deals with the role of bacteria in EAM and with the relationship of the antibody titre to the electro-physiological findings."
