Here, we find that PSD-95 assembles a postsynaptic protein complex containing nNOS and NMDA receptors. Formation of this complex is mediated by the PDZ domains of PSD-95, which bind to the COOH termini of specific NMDA receptor subunits. In contrast, nNOS is recruited to this complex by a novel PDZ-PDZ interaction in which PSD-95 recognizes an internal motif adjacent to the consensus nNOS PDZ domain. This internal motif is a structured “pseudo-peptide” extension of the nNOS PDZ that interacts with the peptide-binding pocket of PSD-95 PDZ2. This asymmetric interaction leaves the peptide-binding pocket of the nNOS PDZ domain available to interact with additional COOH-terminal PDZ ligands. Accordingly, we find that the nNOS PDZ domain can bind PSD-95 PDZ2 and a COOH-terminal peptide simultaneously. This bivalent nature of the nNOS PDZ domain further expands the scope for assembly of protein networks by PDZ domains.

Signaling by the calcium/calmodulin regulated neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)1 in cerebellar neurons is activated by calcium influx throughN-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors (1Bredt D.S.

Therefore, a mechanism must exist to specifically couple NMDA receptor-mediated calcium influx to nNOS.In addition to mediating neuronal functions, nNOS is also found in skeletal muscle, where nNOS localizes to the sarcolemma. Membrane association of nNOS in skeletal muscle is mediated by direct interaction with α1-syntrophin, a component of the dystrophin complex. Binding of nNOS to syntrophin occurs through direct interaction of PDZ protein motifs present near the NH2termini of both proteins (4Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E.

Mice lacking α1-syntrophin lose nNOS protein and enzyme activity from muscle membranes (5Kameya S. Miyagoe Y. Nonaka I. Ikemoto T. Endo M. Hanaoka K. Nabeshima Y. Takeda S. J. Biol.

Furthermore, patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and mdx mice that lack dystrophin evince a selective loss of nNOS from the sarcolemma (6Brenman J.E. Chao D., S. Xia H. Aldape K. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 743-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar).In neurons, nNOS is also associated with cell membranes. In a detailed ultrastructural analysis of primate visual cortex, nNOS immunoreactivity in spines was concentrated over thick postsynaptic specializations of plasma membranes, often in association with NMDA receptors (7Aoki C. Fenstemaker S. Lubin M. Go C.G. Brain Res. 1993; 620: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This synaptic localization of nNOS in brain may be mediated by association with the postsynaptic density protein, PSD-95. Like α1-syntrophin, PSD-95 binds directly to nNOS through a PDZ-PDZ interaction that involves the second PDZ domain of PSD-95 (4Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R.

Moreover, PSD-95 is a member of a larger family of postsynaptic density proteins (PSD-95/SAP-90, PSD-93/chapsyn-110, and SAP-102) that cluster NMDA receptors and may anchor these receptors to the cytoskeleton (4Brenman J.E.

Nature. 1997; 385: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar).The mechanism by which PSD-95 interacts with NMDA receptors has been extensively studied. PSD-95 and its relatives contain three NH2-terminal PDZ motifs (13Kistner U. Wenzel B.M. Veh R.W. Cases-Langhoff C. Garner A.M. Appeltauer U. Voss B. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. J. Biol.

Binding studies show that both the first and second PDZ repeats in PSD-95 potently interact with the COOH-terminal tails of specific NMDA receptor subunits and other ion channels that terminate in a consensus Glu-(Ser/Thr)-X-(Val/Ile)-COOH (15Kornau H.-C.

Neuron. 1996; 17: 759-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Crystallographic studies have determined the structural design of this PDZ-peptide interface, which requires: 1) sequence-specific interactions and 2) peptide termination immediately following the valine (19Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar, 20Schultz J. Hoffmuller U. Krause G. Ashurst J. Macias M.J. Schmieder P. SchneiderMergener J. Oschkinat H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The fact that PSD-95 PDZ2 can interact with both COOH-terminal peptides and with the nNOS PDZ domain is intriguing. Furthermore, the nNOS PDZ not only binds to certain heterologous PDZ domains, but also to COOH-terminal peptide ligands that terminate in Gly-(Asp/Glu)-X-Val-COOH (21Schepens J. Cuppen E. Wieringa B. Hendriks W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 22Stricker N.L. Christopherson K.S. Yi B.A. Schatz P.J. Raab R.W. Dawes G. Bassett D.E. Bredt D.S. Li M. Nature Bio/Technol. 1997; 15: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar).In this study, we compared the mechanisms of these PDZ-PDZ and PDZ-peptide interactions of nNOS and PSD-95, and pursued the synaptic protein PSD-95 as a candidate scaffold molecule to link nNOS to NMDA receptors at the plasma membrane. We demonstrate that nNOS, PSD-95, and the NMDA receptor subunit 2B (NR2B) coimmunoprecipitate from brain, and that PSD-95 is sufficient to assemble a tight ternary complex with nNOS and an NR2B fusion protein. The mechanism for the assembly of this ternary complex depends on a PDZ-PDZ interaction between PSD-95 and nNOS that is mechanistically distinct from PDZ-peptide interactions in that the tertiary structure of both domains is important. We show that the nNOS PDZ domain contains two non-overlapping binding sites, one that binds other PDZ domains and a second site that binds COOH-terminal peptide ligands. In contrast, the second PDZ domain of PSD-95 uses the same interface to bind either the nNOS PDZ or COOH-terminal peptide partners. Finally, we demonstrate that the two binding interfaces on the nNOS PDZ domain can function simultaneously, a finding that expands the scope for PDZ domains in the assembly of multiprotein networks.DISCUSSIONThis study identifies a ternary complex containing nNOS, PSD-95, and the NMDA receptor. nNOS is incorporated into the PSD-95·NMDA receptor complex through a PDZ-PDZ interaction with PDZ2 of PSD-95. This interaction requires the intact tertiary structure of both domains and a 30-amino acid extension beyond the canonical nNOS PDZ domain. Several other examples of PDZ-PDZ interactions have been identified. The neuronal proteins ABP (AMPA receptor-binding protein) and the related glutamate receptor-interacting protein contain seven PDZ domains and can form homomultimers and heteromultimers with each other through a subset of these repeats (31Dong H. O'Brien R.J. Fung E.T. Lanahan A.A. Worley P.F. Huganir R.L. Nature. 1997; 386: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 32Srivastava S. Osten P. Vilim F.S. Khatri L. Inman G. States B.

In Drosophila, the multi-PDZ proteins INAD and Discs Lost also form homomultimers (33Xu X.Z.S. Choudhury A. Li X.L. Montell C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar,34Bhat M.A. Izaddoost S. Lu Y. Cho K.-O. Choi K.-W. Bellen H.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 833-845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Interestingly, homomultimerization of PDZ3 of INAD requires additional amino acids COOH-terminal to the consensus PDZ domain (33Xu X.Z.S. Choudhury A. Li X.L. Montell C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Therefore, the nNOS/PSD-95 interaction defined here may be a general mechanism for PDZ/PDZ binding.Because nNOS is efficiently stimulated by calcium influx through the NMDA receptor but not by other calcium influx pathways (1Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3114) Google Scholar, 2Garthwaite J. Charles S.L. Chess-Williams R. Nature. 1988; 336: 385-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (2269) Google Scholar, 3Kiedrowski L. Costa E. Wroblewski J.T. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), the ternary complex formed between nNOS, PSD-95, and NR2B has important implications for the biology of nNOS. Ultrastructural studies have previously shown that NMDA receptor subunits and a subpopulation of nNOS are co-localized at the postsynaptic density of synaptic spines (7Aoki C. Fenstemaker S. Lubin M. Go C.G. Brain Res. 1993; 620: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 35Aoki C. Rhee J. Lubin M. Dawson T.M. Brain Res. 1997; 750: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 36Huntley G.W. Vickers J.C. Janssen W. Brose N. Heinemann S.F. Morrison J.H. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 3603-3619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Petralia R.S. Yokotani N. Wenthold R.J. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 667-696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies suggest that PSD-95 may function to link plasma membrane receptors to second messenger pathways, in addition to the proposed role for PSD-95 in ion channel clustering. The abnormalities in synaptic plasticity and learning detected in PSD-95 mutant mice (38Migaud M. Charlesworth P. Dempster M. Webster L.C. Watabe A.M. Makhinson M. He Y. Ramsay M.F. Morris R.G.M. Morrison J.H. O'Dell T.J. Grant S.G.N. Nature. 1998; 396: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar) are consistent with a role for PSD-95 in assembly of functional synaptic transduction cascades. Another PDZ-containing protein that has been shown to assemble signaling components is Drosophila INAD, which contains five PDZ domains that interact with multiple components of the visual signal transduction machinery to assemble a functional transduction unit (28Shieh B.H. Zhu M.Y. Neuron. 1996; 16: 991-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar,39Chevesich J. Kreuz A.J. Montell C. Neuron. 1997; 18: 95-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 40Tsunoda S. Sierralta J. Sun Y. Bodner R. Suzuki E. Becker A. Socolich M. Zuker C.S. Nature. 1997; 388: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar).In terms of the molecular mechanism for the nNOS/PSD-95 interaction, nNOS appears to play the role of a ligand PDZ and contains an extended region that interacts with the peptide-binding pocket of the PSD-95 “receptor PDZ.” In support of this model, mutation of the peptide-binding pocket of PSD-95 blocks PDZ-PDZ association, whereas the interaction is not sensitive to mutation of the nNOS peptide-binding site. Furthermore, COOH-terminal peptides that bind PSD-95 block the PDZ-PDZ interaction, but nNOS-binding peptides do not.The extended “ligand” region of the nNOS PDZ contains a “pseudo-peptide” sequence Glu-Thr-Thr-Phe that closely resembles the consensus for peptides binding to PSD-95 Glu-(Thr/Ser)-X-(Val/Ile)-COOH. A major difference is that the previously characterized peptide ligands for PSD-95 require chain termination following the hydrophobic residue (Val). Our recent determination of the crystal structure of the nNOS PDZ demonstrates that this ligand domain is a structurally constrained β-hairpin (30Hillier B.J. Christopherson K.S. Prehoda K.E. Bredt D.S. Lim W.A. Science. 1999; 284: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Unlike typical COOH-terminal PDZ ligands, precise orientation of this nNOS pseudo-peptide appears to be critical, as the complete structured PDZ domain of nNOS is necessary. Interaction of PSD-95 with the nNOS pseudo-peptide is reminiscent of the binding of the α1-syntrophin PDZ domain to engineered cyclic peptides containing an internal recognition sequence, Glu-Thr-Thr-(Leu/Met) (41Gee S.H. Sekely S.A. Lombardo C. Kurakin A. Froehner S.C. Kay B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21980-21987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As we find for the nNOS pseudo-peptide, conformational restriction, in this case peptide cyclization, is necessary to present the critical contact residues in the proper structural context.In addition to making interactions with the peptide-binding groove of α1-syntrophin, the nNOS PDZ domain forms additional “tertiary interactions,” hence this is truly a PDZ-PDZ association. Most of the tertiary contacts come from the most NH2-terminal strand of the nNOS PDZ domain (strand A), which in the complex packs against the syntrophin αβ-helix (30Hillier B.J. Christopherson K.S. Prehoda K.E. Bredt D.S. Lim W.A. Science. 1999; 284: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Residues that participate in this ensemble of primary and tertiary interactions (Ser-95, Asn-102, Ser-109, His-142, and Asp-143) are uniquely conserved in α1-syntrophin, PSD-95 (PDZ2), and PSD-93 (PDZ2), perhaps explaining why only these three PDZ domains heterodimerize with nNOS.The mechanism for PDZ-PDZ binding may to be a prototype for a broader class of interactions with PDZ domains, recognition of internal sequences. Examples of other PDZ proteins that participate in PDZ-internal peptide interactions have been identified. The third PDZ domain of INAD binds to transient receptor potential at an internal Ser-Thr-Val motif (28Shieh B.H. Zhu M.Y. Neuron. 1996; 16: 991-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and PDZ5 of INAD binds an internal motif in phospholipase C-β (42vanHuizen R. Miller K. Chen D.M. Li Y. Lai Z.C. Raab R.W. Stark W.S. Shortridge R.D. Li M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2285-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In addition, the second PDZ domain of protein tyrosine phosphatase-BAS-like and the PDZ domain of reversion-induced LIM gene both bind to internal sequences in the LIM domain of reversion-induced LIM gene (43Cuppen E. Gerrits H. Pepers B. Wieringa B. Hendriks W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 671-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It will be important to determine whether these interactions are also mediated by insertion of a constrained pseudo-peptide ligand into the PDZ domain peptide-binding pocket.Whereas nNOS and α1-syntrophin contain only a single PDZ domain, tandem PDZ domains such as the triplet in PSD-95 are also common. This concatamerization of PDZ domains is likely to facilitate the assembly of multiprotein complexes. Our demonstration that the single nNOS PDZ domain can bind both a COOH-terminal peptide and a heterologous PDZ domain simultaneously identifies an important additional mode for protein scaffolding by PDZ domains. Identified ligands of the peptide-binding site for nNOS in vivo include CAPON (44Jaffrey S.R. Snowman A.M. Eliasson M.J.L. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Neuron. 1998; 20: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) and the glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase (45Firestein B.L. Bredt D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10545-10550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The bivalent nature of the nNOS PDZ domain implies that it may recruit these proteins or other appropriate COOH-terminal ligands to the PSD-95 complex. Furthermore, the fact that nNOS is a stable dimer in solution (46Baek K.J. Thiel B.A. Lucas S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21120-21129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12231-12234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Raman C.S. Li H.Y.

Cell. 1998; 95: 939-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) enhances the possibilities for protein assembly.Our finding that two binding sites exist within the nNOS PDZ may explain the mislocalization of nNOS in Becker's muscular dystrophy (14Cho K.O. Hunt C.A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1992; 9: 929-942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). In human patients and mouse models of Becker's dystrophy, which results from deletions of the central rod-like domain of the dystrophin protein, nNOS is absent from the sarcolemma even though α-syntrophin is properly localized (49Chao D.S. Gorospe J.R.M. Brenman J.E. Rafael J.A. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Hoffman E.P. Chamberlain J.S. Bredt D.S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that proper localization of nNOS in skeletal muscle may also require interaction with another component of the dystrophin complex through the peptide-binding interface of the nNOS PDZ domain. Efficiency and specificity in cellular signaling cascades is often mediated by assembly of multiprotein transduction networks. Signaling by the calcium/calmodulin regulated neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)1 in cerebellar neurons is activated by calcium influx throughN-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors (1Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3114) Google Scholar,2Garthwaite J. Charles S.L. Chess-Williams R.

Binding studies show that both the first and second PDZ repeats in PSD-95 potently interact with the COOH-terminal tails of specific NMDA receptor subunits and other ion channels that terminate in a consensus Glu-(Ser/Thr)-X-(Val/Ile)-COOH (15Kornau H.-C.

Neuron. 1996; 17: 759-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Crystallographic studies have determined the structural design of this PDZ-peptide interface, which requires: 1) sequence-specific interactions and 2) peptide termination immediately following the valine (19Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar, 20Schultz J. Hoffmuller U. Krause G. Ashurst J. Macias M.J. Schmieder P. SchneiderMergener J. Oschkinat H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The fact that PSD-95 PDZ2 can interact with both COOH-terminal peptides and with the nNOS PDZ domain is intriguing. Furthermore, the nNOS PDZ not only binds to certain heterologous PDZ domains, but also to COOH-terminal peptide ligands that terminate in Gly-(Asp/Glu)-X-Val-COOH (21Schepens J. Cuppen E. Wieringa B. Hendriks W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 22Stricker N.L. Christopherson K.S. Yi B.A. Schatz P.J. Raab R.W. Dawes G. Bassett D.E. Bredt D.S. Li M. Nature Bio/Technol. 1997; 15: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In this study, we compared the mechanisms of these PDZ-PDZ and PDZ-peptide interactions of nNOS and PSD-95, and pursued the synaptic protein PSD-95 as a candidate scaffold molecule to link nNOS to NMDA receptors at the plasma membrane. We demonstrate that nNOS, PSD-95, and the NMDA receptor subunit 2B (NR2B) coimmunoprecipitate from brain, and that PSD-95 is sufficient to assemble a tight ternary complex with nNOS and an NR2B fusion protein. The mechanism for the assembly of this ternary complex depends on a PDZ-PDZ interaction between PSD-95 and nNOS that is mechanistically distinct from PDZ-peptide interactions in that the tertiary structure of both domains is important. We show that the nNOS PDZ domain contains two non-overlapping binding sites, one that binds other PDZ domains and a second site that binds COOH-terminal peptide ligands. In contrast, the second PDZ domain of PSD-95 uses the same interface to bind either the nNOS PDZ or COOH-terminal peptide partners. Finally, we demonstrate that the two binding interfaces on the nNOS PDZ domain can function simultaneously, a finding that expands the scope for PDZ domains in the assembly of multiprotein networks. DISCUSSIONThis study identifies a ternary complex containing nNOS, PSD-95, and the NMDA receptor. nNOS is incorporated into the PSD-95·NMDA receptor complex through a PDZ-PDZ interaction with PDZ2 of PSD-95. This interaction requires the intact tertiary structure of both domains and a 30-amino acid extension beyond the canonical nNOS PDZ domain. Several other examples of PDZ-PDZ interactions have been identified. The neuronal proteins ABP (AMPA receptor-binding protein) and the related glutamate receptor-interacting protein contain seven PDZ domains and can form homomultimers and heteromultimers with each other through a subset of these repeats (31Dong H. O'Brien R.J. Fung E.T. Lanahan A.A. Worley P.F. Huganir R.L. Nature. 1997; 386: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 32Srivastava S. Osten P. Vilim F.S. Khatri L. Inman G. States B.

In Drosophila, the multi-PDZ proteins INAD and Discs Lost also form homomultimers (33Xu X.Z.S. Choudhury A. Li X.L. Montell C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar,34Bhat M.A. Izaddoost S. Lu Y. Cho K.-O. Choi K.-W. Bellen H.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 833-845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Interestingly, homomultimerization of PDZ3 of INAD requires additional amino acids COOH-terminal to the consensus PDZ domain (33Xu X.Z.S. Choudhury A. Li X.L. Montell C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Therefore, the nNOS/PSD-95 interaction defined here may be a general mechanism for PDZ/PDZ binding.Because nNOS is efficiently stimulated by calcium influx through the NMDA receptor but not by other calcium influx pathways (1Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3114) Google Scholar, 2Garthwaite J. Charles S.L. Chess-Williams R. Nature. 1988; 336: 385-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (2269) Google Scholar, 3Kiedrowski L. Costa E. Wroblewski J.T. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), the ternary complex formed between nNOS, PSD-95, and NR2B has important implications for the biology of nNOS. Ultrastructural studies have previously shown that NMDA receptor subunits and a subpopulation of nNOS are co-localized at the postsynaptic density of synaptic spines (7Aoki C. Fenstemaker S. Lubin M. Go C.G. Brain Res. 1993; 620: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 35Aoki C. Rhee J. Lubin M. Dawson T.M. Brain Res. 1997; 750: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 36Huntley G.W. Vickers J.C. Janssen W. Brose N. Heinemann S.F. Morrison J.H. J.

Taken together, these studies suggest that PSD-95 may function to link plasma membrane receptors to second messenger pathways, in addition to the proposed role for PSD-95 in ion channel clustering. The abnormalities in synaptic plasticity and learning detected in PSD-95 mutant mice (38Migaud M. Charlesworth P. Dempster M. Webster L.C. Watabe A.M. Makhinson M. He Y. Ramsay M.F. Morris R.G.M. Morrison J.H. O'Dell T.J. Grant S.G.N. Nature. 1998; 396: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar) are consistent with a role for PSD-95 in assembly of functional synaptic transduction cascades. Another PDZ-containing protein that has been shown to assemble signaling components is Drosophila INAD, which contains five PDZ domains that interact with multiple components of the visual signal transduction machinery to assemble a functional transduction unit (28Shieh B.H. Zhu M.Y. Neuron. 1996; 16: 991-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar,39Chevesich J. Kreuz A.J. Montell C. Neuron. 1997; 18: 95-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 40Tsunoda S. Sierralta J. Sun Y. Bodner R. Suzuki E. Becker A. Socolich M. Zuker C.S. Nature. 1997; 388: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar).In terms of the molecular mechanism for the nNOS/PSD-95 interaction, nNOS appears to play the role of a ligand PDZ and contains an extended region that interacts with the peptide-binding pocket of the PSD-95 “receptor PDZ.” In support of this model, mutation of the peptide-binding pocket of PSD-95 blocks PDZ-PDZ association, whereas the interaction is not sensitive to mutation of the nNOS peptide-binding site. Furthermore, COOH-terminal peptides that bind PSD-95 block the PDZ-PDZ interaction, but nNOS-binding peptides do not.The extended “ligand” region of the nNOS PDZ contains a “pseudo-peptide” sequence Glu-Thr-Thr-Phe that closely resembles the consensus for peptides binding to PSD-95 Glu-(Thr/Ser)-X-(Val/Ile)-COOH. A major difference is that the previously characterized peptide ligands for PSD-95 require chain termination following the hydrophobic residue (Val). Our recent determination of the crystal structure of the nNOS PDZ demonstrates that this ligand domain is a structurally constrained β-hairpin (30Hillier B.J. Christopherson K.S. Prehoda K.E. Bredt D.S. Lim W.A. Science. 1999; 284: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Unlike typical COOH-terminal PDZ ligands, precise orientation of this nNOS pseudo-peptide appears to be critical, as the complete structured PDZ domain of nNOS is necessary. Interaction of PSD-95 with the nNOS pseudo-peptide is reminiscent of the binding of the α1-syntrophin PDZ domain to engineered cyclic peptides containing an internal recognition sequence, Glu-Thr-Thr-(Leu/Met) (41Gee S.H. Sekely S.A. Lombardo C. Kurakin A. Froehner S.C. Kay B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21980-21987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As we find for the nNOS pseudo-peptide, conformational restriction, in this case peptide cyclization, is necessary to present the critical contact residues in the proper structural context.In addition to making interactions with the peptide-binding groove of α1-syntrophin, the nNOS PDZ domain forms additional “tertiary interactions,” hence this is truly a PDZ-PDZ association. Most of the tertiary contacts come from the most NH2-terminal strand of the nNOS PDZ domain (strand A), which in the complex packs against the syntrophin αβ-helix (30Hillier B.J. Christopherson K.S. Prehoda K.E. Bredt D.S. Lim W.A. Science. 1999; 284: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Residues that participate in this ensemble of primary and tertiary interactions (Ser-95, Asn-102, Ser-109, His-142, and Asp-143) are uniquely conserved in α1-syntrophin, PSD-95 (PDZ2), and PSD-93 (PDZ2), perhaps explaining why only these three PDZ domains heterodimerize with nNOS.The mechanism for PDZ-PDZ binding may to be a prototype for a broader class of interactions with PDZ domains, recognition of internal sequences. Examples of other PDZ proteins that participate in PDZ-internal peptide interactions have been identified. The third PDZ domain of INAD binds to transient receptor potential at an internal Ser-Thr-Val motif (28Shieh B.H. Zhu M.Y. Neuron. 1996; 16: 991-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and PDZ5 of INAD binds an internal motif in phospholipase C-β (42vanHuizen R. Miller K. Chen D.M. Li Y. Lai Z.C. Raab R.W. Stark W.S. Shortridge R.D. Li M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2285-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In addition, the second PDZ domain of protein tyrosine phosphatase-BAS-like and the PDZ domain of reversion-induced LIM gene both bind to internal sequences in the LIM domain of reversion-induced LIM gene (43Cuppen E. Gerrits H. Pepers B. Wieringa B. Hendriks W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 671-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It will be important to determine whether these interactions are also mediated by insertion of a constrained pseudo-peptide ligand into the PDZ domain peptide-binding pocket.Whereas nNOS and α1-syntrophin contain only a single PDZ domain, tandem PDZ domains such as the triplet in PSD-95 are also common. This concatamerization of PDZ domains is likely to facilitate the assembly of multiprotein complexes. Our demonstration that the single nNOS PDZ domain can bind both a COOH-terminal peptide and a heterologous PDZ domain simultaneously identifies an important additional mode for protein scaffolding by PDZ domains. Identified ligands of the peptide-binding site for nNOS in vivo include CAPON (44Jaffrey S.R. Snowman A.M. Eliasson M.J.L. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Neuron. 1998; 20: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) and the glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase (45Firestein B.L. Bredt D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10545-10550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The bivalent nature of the nNOS PDZ domain implies that it may recruit these proteins or other appropriate COOH-terminal ligands to the PSD-95 complex. Furthermore, the fact that nNOS is a stable dimer in solution (46Baek K.J. Thiel B.A. Lucas S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21120-21129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12231-12234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Raman C.S. Li H.Y.

Hunt C.A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1992; 9: 929-942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). In human patients and mouse models of Becker's dystrophy, which results from deletions of the central rod-like domain of the dystrophin protein, nNOS is absent from the sarcolemma even though α-syntrophin is properly localized (49Chao D.S. Gorospe J.R.M. Brenman J.E. Rafael J.A. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Hoffman E.P. Chamberlain J.S. Bredt D.S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that proper localization of nNOS in skeletal muscle may also require interaction with another component of the dystrophin complex through the peptide-binding interface of the nNOS PDZ domain.

https://openalex.org/W2090394402,"Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), together with sphingosine 1-phosphate, is a bioactive lipid mediator that acts on G-protein-coupled receptors to evoke multiple cellular responses, including Ca2+ mobilization, modulation of adenylyl cyclase, and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation. In this study, we isolated a human cDNA encoding a novel G-protein-coupled receptor, designated EDG7, and characterized it as a cellular receptor for LPA. The amino acid sequence of the EDG7 protein is 53.7 and 48.8% identical to those of the human functional LPA receptors EDG2 and EDG4, respectively, previously identified. LPA (oleoyl) but not other lysophospholipids induced an increase in the [Ca2+]i of EDG7-overexpressing Sf9 cells. Other LPA receptors, EDG4 but not EDG2, transduced the Ca2+response by LPA when expressed in Sf9 cells. LPAs with an unsaturated fatty acid but not with a saturated fatty acid induced an increase in the [Ca2+]i of EDG7-expressing Sf9 cells, whereas LPAs with both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids elicited a Ca2+ response in Sf9 cells expressing EDG4. In EDG7- or EDG4-expressing Sf9 cells, LPA stimulated forskolin-induced increase in intracellular cAMP levels, which was not observed in EDG2-expressing cells. In PC12 cells, EDG4 but not EDG2 or EDG7 mediated the activation of MAP kinase by LPA. Neither the EDG7- nor EDG4-transduced Ca2+ response or cAMP accumulation was inhibited by pertussis toxin. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that EDG7, a new member of the EDG family of G-protein-coupled receptors, is a specific LPA receptor that shows distinct properties from known cloned LPA receptors in ligand specificities, Ca2+ response, modulation of adenylyl cyclase, and MAP kinase activation. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), together with sphingosine 1-phosphate, is a bioactive lipid mediator that acts on G-protein-coupled receptors to evoke multiple cellular responses, including Ca2+ mobilization, modulation of adenylyl cyclase, and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation. In this study, we isolated a human cDNA encoding a novel G-protein-coupled receptor, designated EDG7, and characterized it as a cellular receptor for LPA. The amino acid sequence of the EDG7 protein is 53.7 and 48.8% identical to those of the human functional LPA receptors EDG2 and EDG4, respectively, previously identified. LPA (oleoyl) but not other lysophospholipids induced an increase in the [Ca2+]i of EDG7-overexpressing Sf9 cells. Other LPA receptors, EDG4 but not EDG2, transduced the Ca2+response by LPA when expressed in Sf9 cells. LPAs with an unsaturated fatty acid but not with a saturated fatty acid induced an increase in the [Ca2+]i of EDG7-expressing Sf9 cells, whereas LPAs with both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids elicited a Ca2+ response in Sf9 cells expressing EDG4. In EDG7- or EDG4-expressing Sf9 cells, LPA stimulated forskolin-induced increase in intracellular cAMP levels, which was not observed in EDG2-expressing cells. In PC12 cells, EDG4 but not EDG2 or EDG7 mediated the activation of MAP kinase by LPA. Neither the EDG7- nor EDG4-transduced Ca2+ response or cAMP accumulation was inhibited by pertussis toxin. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that EDG7, a new member of the EDG family of G-protein-coupled receptors, is a specific LPA receptor that shows distinct properties from known cloned LPA receptors in ligand specificities, Ca2+ response, modulation of adenylyl cyclase, and MAP kinase activation. lysophosphatidic acid G-protein-coupled receptor pertussis toxin rapid amplification of cDNA ends 2-acyl-1-lysophosphatidic acid mitogen-activated protein phospholipase C 1-oleoyl-lysophosphatidylcholine 1-oleoyl-lysophosphatidylethanolamine lysophosphatidylinositol phosphatidic acid cyclic PA platelet-activating factor polymerase chain reaction base pair acetoxymethyl ester Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)1 and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) are lipid mediators with diverse biological properties (1Moolenaar W.H.

Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). The cellular responses elicited by LPA vary widely. The effects of LPA on the cell cycle are either mitogenic or antimitotic. LPA stimulates phospholipase C (PLC) activation and consequent Ca2+ mobilization, inhibits adenylyl cyclase, activates mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, and stimulates the transcription of serum response element transcriptional reporter genes, such as c-fos, in various types of cells. It also exerts an effect on the cytoskeleton that can lead to changes in cell shapes and motility, which include inducing stress fiber production and stimulating chemotaxis, cell migration, and tumor cell invasiveness. These actions of LPA are believed to be mediated by seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptor(s) (GPCR) on the cell surfaces. Some functional studies have suggested that multiple subtypes of LPA receptors with distinct signaling properties mediate the diverse cellular effects of LPA (4Tigyi G. Dyer D.L. Miledi R. Proc.

Indeed, several subtypes of LPA receptors, which are GPCRs, were identified recently. The EDG (endothelial cell differentiationgene) family of orphan receptors comprises EDG1 (7Hla T. Maciag T. J.

J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1071-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) first reported that EDG2/Rec1.3/Vzg-1 increased responsiveness to LPA in cell rounding and adenylyl-cyclase inhibition assays when overexpressed in cerebral cortical cell lines, showing that EDG2/Rec1.3/Vzg-1 is a receptor for LPA. Because LPA and S1P are structurally related, this finding has enabled scientists to examine whether members of EDG family function as receptors for LPA and S1P. At present, according to their amino acid sequence homologies, ligand specificities, and genomic structures (15Zhang G. Contos J.J. Weiner J.A. Fukushima N. Chun J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1999; 227: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), these GPCRs of the EDG family fall into two major groups that interact either with LPA (EDG2 (9Hecht J.H. Weiner J.A.

Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar)). The ligand of EDG6, which is expressed predominantly in lymphoid tissue (14Graler M.H. Bernhardt G. Lipp M. Genomics. 1998; 53: 164-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), has not been elucidated yet. A novel GPCR, named PSP24, which does not show significant sequence similarity with any member of the EDG family, has also been isolated fromXenopus oocytes as a functional receptor for LPA (21Guo Z. Liliom K. Fischer D.J. Bathurst I.C. Tomei L.D. Kiefer M.C. Tigyi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14367-14372Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Because some LPA-responsive cells do not express known LPA receptors (EDG2, EDG4, and PSP24), it was expected that unidentified subtypes of LPA receptors were suggested to be present in mammals (11An S. Bleu T. Hallmark O.G. Goetzl E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7906-7910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 22Fischer D.J. Liliom K. Guo Z. Nusser N. Virag T. Murakami-Murofushi K. Kobayashi S. Erickson J.R. Sun G. Miller D.D. Tigyi G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To understand the biological functions of LPA fully, we attempted to identify novel subtypes of LPA receptors. In this study, we identified and characterized a novel GPCR, EDG7, the third functional LPA receptor belonging to the EDG family. 1-Oleoyl-LPA, 1-palmitoyl-LPA, 1-stearoyl-LPA, 1-oleoyl-lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), 1-oleoyl-lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE), 1-oleoyl-lysophosphatidylserine (LPS), porcine liver lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI), S1P, egg yolk phosphatidic acid (PA), dioleoyl-phosphatidylserine, and platelet-activating factor (PAF C16) were purchased from Avanti polar lipids (Alabaster, AL). 2-Acyl-1-lysophosphatidic acid (2-acyl-LPA) was prepared from egg yolk PA (5 nmol) as follows. PA was incubated with Rhizopus delemer lipase (20 mg/ml; Seikagaku-kogyo, Tokyo, Japan) in a 50 mm Tris-malate buffer, pH 5.7, at 37 °C for 2 h in the presence of one-quarter volume of diethyl ether. After the free fatty acids had been extracted with diethyl ether/petroleum ether (1:1 v/v) four times, the remaining lysophospholipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (23Bligh E.C. Dyer W.F. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). 2-Acyl-LPA contains mostly oleic acid and linoleic acid, because egg yolk PA is prepared from egg yolk phosphatidylcholine, which contains those fatty-acid chains at thesn-2 position. Because the 2-acyl-1-lysophospholipids were not stable, they were stored at −80 °C in chloroform/methanol (2:1 v/v) and used within 24 h after mixing with a buffer solution. Cyclic PA (cPA) and its analogs were prepared as described (24Kobayashi S. Tokunoh R. Shibasaki M. Shinagawa R. Murakami-Murofushi K. Tetrahedron Lett. 1993; 34: 4047-4050Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared from about 107 human Jurkat T cells, and 5.0 μg was reverse-transcribed into DNA using the cDNA Cycle Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with an oligo(dT) primer. The degenerate PCR primers were designed based on the amino acid sequences of the second and sixth of the seven transmembrane regions of the G-protein-coupled receptors EDG2 and EDG4. The oligonucleotides used were: GCIGCIGCIGA(C/T)(C/T)T(C/T)TTCGC (DP2; based on the second transmembrane region) and ACIAGICCIGGIGTCCAGCA (DP6; based on the sixth transmembrane region). Each PCR was carried out using 2.5 units Ex-Taq DNA polymerase (Takara Shuzo Co. Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) and 25% of the reverse-transcriptase reaction mixture in a 100-μl reaction mixture containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 200 μm dNTP, and 50 pmol of each degenerate oligonucleotide primer (DP2 and DP6). 35 PCR cycles, each consisting of 45 s at 94 °C (denaturation), 2 min at 55 °C (annealing), and 3 min at 72 °C (elongation) were performed, with the first cycle including an extended denaturation period (5 min), during which the polymerase was added. The 554-bp PCR products were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and subcloned into a T-vector using the original TA-Cloning Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Plasmid DNA was prepared using the Wizard Minipreps DNA Purification System (Promega, Madison, WI), and sequencing was performed by the dideoxy chain termination method using the ABI377 system (Perkin-Elmer, Branchburg, NJ). A MarathonTM cDNA Amplification Kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was used to perform 5′- and 3′- RACE. Double-stranded cDNA was prepared from poly(A)+ RNA of human Jurkat T cells, and nested PCR was carried out using the cDNA as a template and AP1, AP2 (supplied in the Marathon 228 cDNA Amplification Kit), and internal oligonucleotide primers (FW1, FW2, RV1, and RV2, see below) as PCR primers under the conditions described above. The sequences of the oligonucleotides were: FW1, AACCAACGTCTTGTCTCCGCATAC (nucleotide positions 690–713); FW2, AGCTAATGAAGACGGTGATGACTG (nucleotide positions 749–772); RV1, GTCCAGAAGCCCCTGACGGAGAAA (nucleotide positions 349–372); and RV2, AGCAAGTTGGTGAGGGAAGCAGTC (nucleotide positions 381–404). The resulting DNA fragments were subcloned, and their DNA sequences were determined. Then the DNA fragment covering the open reading frame of EDG7 was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR using the cDNA from human Jurkat cells and oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the 5′- and 3′-noncoding regions and Pfu DNA polymerase (Toyobo, Tokyo, Japan). At least three independent reverse transcription-PCRs were carried out. Sf9 insect cells were grown in a serum-free ExCell-420 insect cell medium (Nichirei, Tokyo, Japan) at 27 °C. PC12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) containing 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. The cDNA encoding the coding region of EDG7 (nucleotide positions 38–1104) was inserted into theEcoRI/NotI site of the baculovirus transfer vector pFASTBAC1 (Life Technologies, Inc.). To achieve expression of FLAG-tagged EDG7, cDNA with a FLAG tag at its N-terminal was generated by the PCR using the following oligonucleotides: ATGCGAATTCATGGACTACAAAGACGATGACGATAAAAATGAGTGTCACTATGACAAGCAC and ATGCGCGGCCGCTCCAGAGTTTAGGAAGTGCTTTTA. The resulting DNA fragment was digested by EcoRI/NotI and ligated into pFASTBAC1. Recombinant viruses were prepared using the Bac-to-Bac system (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For infection, 6 × 105cells/ml were mixed with recombinant or wild-type Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus to produce a multiplicity of infection of 10 and incubated for 48 h at 27 °C. Expression of the FLAG-tagged protein was detected by Western blotting with an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M5; Eastman Kodak Company, New Haven, CT). For preparation of recombinant baculoviruses to express FLAG-tagged EDG2 and FLAG-tagged EDG4, cDNAs with FLAG tag at their N-terminal were generated by the reverse transcription-PCR using human brain cDNA as template DNA and the following oligonucleotides: ATGCGAATTCATGGACTACAAAGACGATGACGATAAAGCTGCCATCTCTACTTCCATCCCT, ATGCGCGGCCGCCTAAACCACAGAGTGATCATTGCT (for EDG2) and ATGCGAATTCATGGACTACAAAGACGATGACGATAAAGTCATCATGGGCCAGTGCTACTAC, ATGCGCGGCCGCTCAGTCCTGTTGGTTGGGTTGAGC (for EDG4). The resulting DNA fragments were digested byEcoRI/NotI and ligated into pFASTBAC1, and baculoviruses were prepared as described above. DNA sequences of cDNAs prepared by reverse transcription-PCR were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Sf9 cells were harvested 2 days after baculovirus infection, washed gently with an HBS buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 120 mmNaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2,1.25 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mmKH2PO4, and 10 mm glucose), and loaded with 2 μm Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (Fura-2 AM; Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) for 45 min. Free Fura-2 AM was washed out, and the cells were resuspended in the HBS buffer to produce a concentration of 106 cells/ml. Agonist-induced Fura-2 AM fluorescence of samples in quartz cuvettes kept at 27 °C was monitored at excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 300 nm using a CAF-110 spectrofluorimeter (Japan Spectroscopy, Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Fluorescence was recorded before and after addition of LPA and other phospholipids, which were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.01% (w/v) of fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma). 24 h after baculovirus infection of the Sf9 cells, PTX (100 ng/ml; Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) was added to the culture medium, and incubation was continued for an additional 24 h. Then the cells were collected, and their Ca2+ responses were tested as described above. The phospholipase C inhibitor U73122 (3 μm; Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) was added to Sf9 cells 3 min before LPA was added. Sf9 cells (5 × 105) infected by each baculovirus for 48 h were washed with a binding buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.25% bovine serum albumin) and incubated for 60 min at 0 °C in the same buffer containing various concentration of [3H]LPA in a 96-well membrane filter plate (pore size, 65 nm; Millipore, Orlando, FL). Then the cells were washed three times with the wash buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin) using a Multi-screen Filtration System (Millipore), and the radioactivity bound to the cells was quantified using a β-counter. Total and nonspecific binding was evaluated in the absence and presence of 10 μm nonradioactive LPA, respectively. To examine the specificity of LPA binding, the amounts of LPA bound (using 10 nm of [3H] LPA) in the presence of excess nonradioactive LPA (10 μm), LPS (10 μm), LPC (1 μm), LPI (10 μm), LPE (10 μm), S1P (10 μm), and PAF (1 μm) (10 μm of LPC or PAF caused cell lysis) were determined, and the specific binding value was calculated by subtracting the nonspecific binding value (cpm) from the total binding value (cpm). Sf9 cells were infected with recombinant baculoviruses and harvested 2 days after infection. Cells were incubated with 5 μm forskolin in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (0.5 mm) for 10 min followed by a 20-min stimulation with 2.5 μm LPA with various acyl chains in an HBS buffer. cAMP levels were determined using a cAMP enzyme immunoassay system (Biotrak; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), following the instructions of the manufacturer. To measure MAP kinase-mediated signal transduction, we employed the PathDetectTM Elk1 Trans-Reporting System (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). This assay employs a fusion protein that contains the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 and the transactivation domain of Elk1 to induce expression of a luciferase reporter driven by an artificial promoter containing five GAL4-binding sites. Phosphorylation of the transactivation domain of Elk1 by MAP kinase, in turn, activates the transcription of the luciferase gene from the reporter plasmid. cDNAs encoding FLAG-tagged EDG7, EDG2, and EDG4 were inserted intoEcoRI/NotI sites of the mammalian expression plasmid pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) (FLAG-EDG7-pcDNA3, FLAG-EDG2-pcDNA3, and FLAG-EDG4pcDNA3). Transient transfections were performed using SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Briefly, 100,000 PC12 cells were seeded in 24-well plates 24 h before the transfection. Each point was transfected with 200 ng of FLAG-EDG7-pcDNA3 (or FLAG-EDG2-pcDNA3, FLAG-EDG4-pcDNA3, or empty pcDNA3 for the control experiment), 200 ng of pFR-Luc, 25 ng of pFA-Elk1 (as described by Stratagene), and 575 ng of the empty pcDNA3 vector. 12 h post-transfection, the cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in a serum-free medium for another 12 h. The cells were then stimulated with 10 μm of LPA (oleoyl) for 10 h at 37 °C and lysed in 500 μl of an extraction buffer, 100 μl of which was used to measure luciferase activity, following the instructions of the manufacturer. Expression of each protein was confirmed by immunofluorescence using anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M5. Human Multiple Tissue Northern blots were purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA), DNA probes (nucleotide positions 307–730) were labeled by random priming with [α-32P]dCTP, and hybridization was carried out at 65 °C for 4 h in a rapid hybridization buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Each blot was rinsed with 2× SSC at room temperature for 5 min, washed twice with 0.5× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 40 min, and then autoradiographed using Kodak X-Omat AR film at −80 °C with an intensifying screen for 12 h. Finally, each blot was rehybridized with a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) as an internal standard. We investigated a previously unidentified GPCR belonging to the EDG family by subjecting cDNA of human Jurkat T cells to PCR amplification. Two blocks of conserved amino acid sequences in EDG2 and EDG4, one from the second and one from the sixth transmembrane domain, were chosen for the synthesis of the degenerate oligonucleotide primers DP2 and DP6 (see “Materials and Methods”). The PCR reaction was performed, yielding a 554-bp fragment containing a GPCR-like sequence distinct from those of known members of the EDG family. Using 5′- and 3′-RACE, we isolated a DNA fragment that covered the entire open reading frame of this novel gene. Complete sequencing of the DNA revealed a 1059-bp open reading frame flanked by a 42-bp 5′-untranslated region and a 44-bp 3′-untranslated region. The translational initiation site (ATG) was assigned to the first methionine codon (nucleotide positions 43–45), because an in-frame stop codon was present upstream of this methionine residue and flanking sequences (CCACA) were present, fulfilling Kozak's criteria for initiation (25Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar). An in-frame translational termination codon (TAA) was present after nucleotide 1,101. Therefore, we concluded that this new GPCR contains 353 amino acids and that its molecular mass is 40,128 Da (Fig. 1 A).Figure 1Amino acid sequences of EDG7.

The first and second lines indicate the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences, respectively, with the nucleotide and amino acid positions shown on the left and right, respectively.

C, phylogenetic tree of the EDG family. The phylogenetic tree depicted was derived by the neighbor joining method performed by the GENETYX-MAC program. The sequence divergence between any pair of sequences is equal to the sum of the lengths of the horizontal branches connecting the two sequences.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with those of known EDG sequences revealed that the primary structure of the predicted protein was similar to those of the GPCRs of the EDG family, with overall sequence identities to human EDG1, human EDG2 (Vzg-1), human EDG3, human EDG4, rat H218, and human EDG6 of 34.8, 53.7, 36.3, 48.8, 33.8, and 35.5%, respectively. Therefore, the protein encoded by the cloned cDNA was named EDG7 (Fig. 1 B). A high degree of similarity between EDG2 and EDG4 (approximately 50%; Fig.1 B) was observed among EDG7, EDG2, and EDG4. To gain better understanding of the relationships involved in the molecular evolution of the EDG family, a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor joining method (Fig. 1 C). According to this phylogenetic tree, the EDG family can be classified into two distinct groups: EDG1, EDG3, H218/AGR16, and EDG6 belong to one, and EDG2, EDG4, and EDG7 belong to the other. Because EDG1, EDG3, and H218/AGR16 have been reported to function as S1P receptors and EDG2 and EDG4 have been reported to function as LPA receptors, EDG7, EGD2, and EDG4 appear to form a subfamily of the EDG family, and EDG7 may function as a receptor for LPA. To explore the hypothesis that EDG7 is a receptor for LPA, we expressed the recombinant receptor in Sf9 insect cells and measured the increases in the [Ca2+]i evoked by LPA. We chose Sf9 cells because, although LPA does not affect their [Ca2+]i, it induces rapid increases in the [Ca2+]i of almost all types of mammalian cells. Western blotting analysis using anti-FLAG antibody M5 confirmed that an approximately 35-kDa protein containing the FLAG tag was expressed in cells infected with EDG7 baculovirus but not with the wild-type virus (Fig. 2 A). The addition of 1 μm oleoyl-LPA to Sf9 cells infected with either the FLAG-EDG7-expressing (Fig. 2 B) or EDG7-expressing recombinant baculovirus (data not shown) increased the [Ca2+]i. However, no such Ca2+response was observed in Sf9 cells infected with wild-type baculovirus (Fig. 2 B) or in uninfected control cells (data not shown), even if the cells were treated with 10 μmLPA. The structurally related lipids 1-oleoyl-LPC, 1-oleoyl-LPE, 1-oleoyl-LPS, 2-oleoyl-LPS, 1-acyl-LPI, PAF, and S1P, each at a concentration of 1 μm, failed to elicit significant increases in the [Ca2+]i (Fig.2 C). We also expressed known LPA receptors EDG2 and EDG4 in Sf9 cells and compared their Ca2+ response. Protein expression was confirmed by Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibody (Fig.2 A). The expression of EDG2 protein was much higher than those of EDG4 and EDG7, but it failed to transmit a detectable Ca2+ signal in response to LPA (oleoyl) (Fig.2 B), consistently with the observation by Zondag et al. (17Zondag G.C. Postma F.R. Etten I.V. Verlaan I. Moolenaar W.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 605-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). On the other hand, EDG4 mediated a Ca2+signal like EDG7 in Sf9 cells (Fig. 2 B). Thus, both EDG4 and EDG7 but not EDG2 mediate the Ca2+ response by LPA in Sf9 cells. We investigated the specific binding of [3H]oleoyl-LPA to Sf9 cells expressing FLAG-EDG7, FLAG-EDG2, and FLAG-EDG4 using various doses of LPA. EDG7- and EDG4-expressing Sf9 cells increased the specific binding of [3H]oleoyl-LPA in comparison with wild-type baculovirus and EDG2-infected cells (Fig.3 A). The apparentK d values of EDG7 and EDG4 for [3H]LPA are 206 and 73.6 nm, respectively (Fig. 3 B). Thus, the binding affinity for LPA of EDG7 is relatively lower than that of EDG4. We also examined the competition between the binding of [3H]LPA and related nonradioactive lipids to FLAG-EDG7-expressing Sf9 cells. LPA (10 μm) reduced [3H]LPA binding, whereas the other related lipids examined (LPC, LPE, LPS, LPI, S1P, and PAF) did not (Fig.3 C). These data clearly demonstrate that EDG7 represents a specific receptor for LPA. Several molecular species of LPA with saturated (stearoyl- (18:0), palmitoyl- (16:0)) or unsaturated (oleoyl- (18:1), linoleoyl- (18:2), arachidonoyl- (20:4)) acyl chains have been detected in activated platelets (26Gerrard J.M. Robinson P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1001: 282-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We then investigated which structural features of LPA are important for the EDG7-dependent activation of Ca2+ mobilization. 1-Oleoyl-LPA is a good ligand for EDG7 (Fig. 2 B). As shown in Fig. 5, however, 1-acyl-2-lysophosphatidic acids with saturated acyl chains (1-stearoyl-, 1-palmitoyl-, and 1-myristoyl-LPA), at a concentration of 10 μm, failed to elicit significant increases in [Ca2+]i. Furthermore, 2-acyl-LPA, which contains a mixture of oleic and linoleic acids at thesn-2 position (see “Materials and Methods”), elicited a significant increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig.4, A–E). No such Ca2+ response of Sf9 cells infected with wild-type baculovirus was induced by 2-acyl-LPA (data not shown). The ligand specificity of EDG4 was also examined in this system. In marked contrast with EDG7, 1-myristoyl-, 1-palmitoyl-, 1-stearoyl-, 1-oleoyl-, and 2-acyl-LPA equally elicited a significant increase in the [Ca2+]i in Sf9 cells expressing EDG4 (Fig.4, F–J).Figure 4Substrate specificity of EDG7 and EDG4.The activities of LPA and its acyl chain analogs to induce rapid, transient increases in [Ca2+]i in Sf9 cells expressing EDG7 (A–E) or EDG4 (F–J) were measured. Cells, loaded with Fura-2 AM, were stimulated with various concentrations of LPAs, and changes in [Ca2+]iwere analyzed using CAF-110 spectrofluorimeter. The means were calculated from the results of three separate experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2036147144,"Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are activated by diverse extracellular signals and participate in the regulation of an array of cellular programs. In this study, we investigated the roles of MAPKs in the induction of phase II detoxifying enzymes by chemicals. Treatment of human hepatoma (HepG2) and murine hepatoma (Hepa1c1c7) cells withtert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) or sulforaphane (SUL), two potent phase II enzyme inducers, stimulated the activity of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 2 (ERK2) but not c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1. tBHQ and SUL also activated MAPK kinase. Inhibition of MAPK kinase with its inhibitor, PD98059, abolished ERK2 activation and impaired the induction of quinone reductase, a phase II detoxifying enzyme, and antioxidant response element (ARE)-linked reporter gene by tBHQ and SUL. Overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of ERK2 also attenuated tBHQ and SUL induction of ARE reporter gene activity. Interestingly, although expression of Ras and its mutant forms showed distinct effects on basal ARE reporter gene activity, they did not affect the activation of reporter gene by the inducers. Furthermore, a dominant-negative mutant of Ras had little effect on ERK2 activation by tBHQ and SUL, implicating a Ras-independent mechanism. Indeed, both tBHQ and SUL were able to stimulate Raf-1 kinase activity in vivo as well as in vitro. Thus, our results indicate that the induction of ARE-dependent phase II detoxifying enzymes is mediated by a MAPK pathway, which may involve direct activation of Raf-1 by the inducers.

Goddsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). A typical MAPK cascade consists of three kinases: a MAPK kinase kinase, which phosphorylates and activates a MAPK kinase, which, in turn, phosphorylates and activates MAPK (2Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). A well established MAPK pathway is the Ras-dependent activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERKs) (3Avruch J. Zhang X. Kyriakis J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 279-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). In this pathway, activated Ras recruits Raf (a MAPK kinase kinase) to the membrane, resulting in activation of Raf. The activated Raf then phosphorylates and activates MEK (a MAPK kinase), which directly activates ERK through dual phosphorylation on threonyl and tyrosyl residues within the tripeptide motif TEY. Parallel to ERK pathway, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is regulated by a distinct module consisting of MEKK1/ASK/TAK-MKK4/MKK7-JNK (4Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar), which is farther regulated by the small GTPases, Rac1 or Cdc42 (5Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). ERK and JNK are often responsive to different extracellular signals (6Wu J. Rossomando A.J. Her J.H.

However, they can also be activated by the same stimuli such as mitogenic signals, growth factors, oncogenic Ras (8Logan S. Falasca M. Hu P. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5784-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 9Vojtek A.B. Der C.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). Once activated, ERK and JNK can phosphorylate a number of cytosolic proteins and transcription factors such as c-Jun, ATF2, and ternary complex factors, resulting in the enhancement of their transcriptional activities and activation of dependent genes (12Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar). Considering the general involvement of MAPK pathways in cellular responses to various stimuli, we examined the roles of these kinases in the induction of phase II detoxifying enzymes by chemicals. Phase II detoxifying enzymes include NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase/DT-diaphorase (QR), glutathioneS-transferases (GSTs), UDP-glucuronosyl transferases, and epoxide hydrolases. These enzymes are capable of converting the reactive electrophiles to less toxic and more readily excretable products, thus protecting cells against various chemical stresses and carcinogenesis (13Wattenberg L.W. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 14Benson A.M. Batzinger R.P. Ou S.Y. Bueding E. Cha Y.N. Talalay P.

Biochemical and genetic studies revealed that the induction of phase II detoxifying enzymes by various chemicals occurs at the transcriptional level and is regulated by acis-acting regulatory element, defined as antioxidant responsive element (ARE) or electrophile-responsive element. This regulatory element was first detected in the 5′-flanking region of the rat and mouse GST Ya subunit gene (16Rushmore T.H. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14648-14653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Friling R.S. Bensimon A. Tichauer Y. Daniel V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1991; 266: 4556-4561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is also expected to be present in the promoters of epoxide hydrolase and UDP-glucuronosyl transferase genes. Because the ARE core sequence (GTGACnnnGC) is similar to AP-1-binding site (TGACTCA), it has been suggested that AP-1 may be the activator of ARE. Indeed, the components of AP-1 complex, such as c-Jun and c-Fos, are found to bind to ARE sequence, and overexpression of c-Jun leads the induction of ARE-dependent genes (21Friling R.S. Bergelson S. Daniel V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 668-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 22Diccianni M.B. Imagawa M. Muramatsu M.

Daniel V. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 565-571PubMed Google Scholar). However, several independent studies indicate that the major ARE-binding proteins that mediate the induction of detoxifying enzymes may not be the AP-1 proteins (25Nguyen T. Rushmore T.H. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13656-13662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Wang B. Williamson G. Biochim. Biophys.

Although the identity of ARE-binding proteins remains to be characterized, activation of the ARE-protein complex by phase II enzyme inducers is believed to be regulated by signal transducing kinase cascades (29Hays J.D. Pulford D.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 445-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (3267) Google Scholar, 30Ainbinder E. Bergelson S. Daniel V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified ERK2 kinase pathway to be involved in the ARE-mediated induction of phase II detoxifying enzymes by tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) and sulforaphane (SUL). Furthermore, we showed that this induction may involve direct activation Raf-1 by the inducers, thus implicating the existence of a novel Ras-independent pathway for Raf-1 activation. HepG2 and Hepa1c1c7 cell lines (obtained from American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2.2 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were normally starved overnight in serum-free medium before treatment, unless otherwise indicated. Rabbit anti-ERK2 and anti-Raf-1 polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5) was purchased from Boeringer Mannheim. Rabbit anti-JNK1 antiserum (Ab101) was described previously (31Yu R. Jiao J.-J. Duh J.-L. Tan T.-H. Kong A.-N.T. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2954-2959PubMed Google Scholar). GST-c-Jun (1–79)-expressing plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Karin (University of California, San Diego, CA). GST-c-Jun fusion protein was purified from Escherichia colilysates with aid of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Construct pARE-CAT containing a single copy of 41-base pair rat GST-Ya subunit ARE (5′-GAGCTTGGAAATGGCATTGCTAATGGTGACAAAGCAACTTT) and a minimal GST-Ya promoter was a gift from Dr. Rushmore (Merck Research Laboratory, West Point, PA). ARE-luciferase reporter construct, pTI-ARE-luciferase, which contains a single copy of 41-base pair mouse ARE (5′-TAGCTTGGAAATGACATTGCTAATGGTGACAAAGCAACTTT) and minimal TATA-Inr promoter) was obtained from Dr. Fahl (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). pLNCAL7 expression constructs for HA-tagged ERK2(WT) and dominant-negative mutant ERK2(KR) have been described previously (32Her J.-H. Lakhani S. Zu K. Vila J. Dent P. Sturgill T.W. Weber M.J. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1993; 296: 25-31Google Scholar). pZIP retrovirus constructs of ras(WT),ras(61L), and ras(17N) were constructed as described previously (33Buss J.E. Solski P.A. Schaeffer J.P. MacDonald M.J. Der C.J. Science. 1989; 243: 1600-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The specific MEK-1 inhibitor (PD98059) and the Raf-1 substrate (inactive MEK fusion protein) were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). SUL was purchased from LKT Laboratories (St. Paul, MN). tBHQ was purchased from Aldrich. Myelin basic protein (MBP) was purchased from Sigma. [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. After treatment with SUL or tBHQ (both agents were dissolved in Me2SO), and cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.1, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 30 mmNa4P2O7, 100 μmNa3VO4, 2 mm iodoacetatic acid, 5 μm zinc chloride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5% Triton X-100. Cell lysates were homogenized by passing through a 23-G needle three times and left on ice for 15 min. The homogenates were then centrifuged at high speed for 15 min at 4 °C. Endogenous ERK2, JNK1, or Raf-1 in the supernatants were immunoprecipitated with the respective antibodies and assayed for kinase activity by the method described previously (31Yu R. Jiao J.-J. Duh J.-L. Tan T.-H. Kong A.-N.T. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2954-2959PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, following immunoprecipitation, the immunocomplex was washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with kinase assay buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 10 mm ρ-nitrophenyl phosphate. Kinase reaction was initiated by resuspending the immunopreciptate in a 30-μl kinase assay buffer supplemented with 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 20 μm ATP, and 2 μg of the indicated substrates. After incubation for 15 min in ERK and Raf-1 assays or for 30 min in JNK assay at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated with Laemmli's buffer. Samples were heated to 95 °C for 5 min and analyzed by electrophoresis. The phosphorylated substrates were visualized by autoradiography, and quantitated with a phosphorimager (AMBIS, Inc., San Diego, CA). After treatment, cell lysates were prepared as described in immunocomplex kinase assays. Total activity of MAPK kinase 1 and MAPK kinase 2 (MEK1/2) in cell lysates was determined using an inactive p42MAPK mutant K52R as substrate as described previously (34Chen Q. Olashaw N. Wu J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28499-28502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Briefly, equal portions (about 2 μg of protein) of cell lysates was incubated with 2.5 μg of K52R in a 30-μl kinase assay buffer with addition of 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 25 μm ATP. The kinase reaction was terminated with Laemmli's buffer 15 min after incubation at 30 °C. Phosphorylated K52R was resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. HepG2 cells were plated in six-well plates 24 h before transfection at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/well. Cells were transfected with different plasmids as indicated in the figure legends using FuGENETM 6 (0.7 μg of DNA/μl of reagent), according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After overnight incubation with transfection mixture, cells were cultured in fresh medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 12 h prior to drug treatment. The β-galactosidase activity was determined as described previously (35Rosenthal L. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 704-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). For CAT activity assay, transfected cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline after drug treatment and harvested in lysis buffer provided by manufacturer (Promega, Madison, WI). 10 μg of protein, as determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), was incubated with reaction buffer for 60 min at 37 °C. The acetylated products of [14C]chloramphenicol were separated by TLC, visualized by autoradiography, and quantitated by Biological Image Analysis (AMBIS, Inc., San Diego, CA). All CAT activities were normalized against β-galactosidase activity. Luciferase activity was determined according to the protocol provided by manufacturer (Promega). Briefly, after drug treatment, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in reporter lysis buffer. Following brief centrifugation (5 s) at high speed, the supernatant was transferred to a new tube, and 20 μl of cell lysate was assayed for luciferase activity using a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). Luciferase activity was normalized against β-galactosidase activity yielding a final value of relative light units/β-galactosidase units. After treatment, Hepa1c1c7 cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 125 mm sucrose. Cell suspension was sonicated for 5 s and left on ice for 10 min. The homogenates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were transferred to the new tubes, and protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Quinone reductase activity was determined by measuring the reduction of 2,6-dichloroindophenol (36Ernster L. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 309-317Crossref Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Approximately 5 μg of total cytosolic protein was added to the cuvette containing 1 ml of assay buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 60 μg bovine serum albumin, 5 μm FAD, 0.2 mm NADH, 80 μm 2, 6-dichloroindophenol, and 0.01% Tween 20). Reaction was performed for 5 min at room temperature and terminated with 30 μm dicumarol. The absorbance of reaction mixture at 600 nm was read on a spectrophotometer, and QR activity was expressed as nmol of 2,6-dichloroindophenol reduced per min per mg of protein. Cell lysates were prepared as described in immunocomplex kinase assays. 25 μg of protein was resolved with 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difuoride membrane using a semi-dry transfer system (Fisher). Membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 8 g/liter NaCl, and 0.2 g/liter KCl for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with 1 μg/ml primary antibodies in Tris-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C. Membrane was washed three times with Tris-buffered saline and blotted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Membrane was again washed three times with Tris-buffered saline and analyzed by the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In the previous studies, we have shown that tBHQ induced ERK2 activity in a time- and dose-dependent manner in HepG2 cells (37Yu R. Tan T.-H. Kong A.-N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28962-28970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To study the activation of ERK2 by SUL, we treated HepG2 cells with various concentrations of SUL. The endogenous ERK2 activity was determined byin vitro immunocomplex kinase assays. As shown in Fig.1 A, ERK2 activity began to increase at 5 μm of SUL. A maximal activity (approximately 8-fold over the control cells) was seen at 50 μm. The stimulated ERK2 activity began to decline when the concentration of SUL reached 100 μm, indicating that ERK2 activation by SUL was a dose-dependent event. The decreased ERK2 activation at relative high concentrations of SUL, such 100 μm, seemed not due to the toxic effect of this compound, because no morphological change or cell death was observed when ERK2 activity was measured (data not shown). ERK2 activation by SUL in HepG2 cells was also time-dependent (Fig. 1 B). The induced ERK2 activity appeared at 30 min, reached the maximum between 1 and 2 h after treatment with SUL, and then declined. Interestingly, the time course of ERK2 activation by SUL was very similar to that of ERK2 activation by tBHQ (37Yu R. Tan T.-H. Kong A.-N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28962-28970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), suggesting that two inducers may regulate ERK2 activity through a common pathway. When Western blotting was performed, no change in the protein level of ERK2 was observed throughout the dose response as well as time course studies (Fig. 1, A andB), indicating that the induction of ERK2 activity resulted from the phosphorylation of pre-existing ERK2 molecules rather thande novo protein synthesis. We also examined ERK2 activation in Hepa1c1c7 cells, which, like HepG2 cells, have been widely used for the study of phase II enzyme induction (38Prochaska H.J. Talalay P. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 4776-4782PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 C, both SUL and tBHQ stimulated ERK2 activity. The activation of ERK2 was dose-dependent, with a maximal activity seen at 25 μm of SUL or at 100 μm of tBHQ. After demonstration of ERK2 activation, we examined the involvement of JNK1, another member of MAPK family. As shown in Fig. 2 A, SUL did not stimulate JNK1 activity; instead, relatively high concentrations of SUL reduced the JNK1 activity to the levels much lower than that seen in control cells (0.1% Me2SO-treated cells). Furthermore, SUL, at concentrations that induced ERK2 activity, inhibited JNK1 activation by UVC and anisomycin (Fig. 2 B). These results, together with our previous observation that tBHQ weakly stimulated JNK1 activity in HepG2 cells (37Yu R. Tan T.-H. Kong A.-N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28962-28970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), suggest that the JNK pathway may not be involved or at least are not essential in tBHQ- or SUL-induced cell signaling that leads to the induction of gene expression. We have previously shown that ERK2 activation by tBHQ requires the involvement of an upstream signaling kinase MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) (37Yu R. Tan T.-H. Kong A.-N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28962-28970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To determine whether ERK2 activation by SUL also requires MEK, we measured the MEK activity in SUL-treated HepG2 cells using an inactive kinase ERK2(K52R) as substrate. As shown in Fig. 3 A, SUL stimulated phosphorylation of K52R in a dose-dependent manner similar to that seen in ERK2 activity assay. This result indicates that MEK was activated in the cells treated with SUL. To provide further evidence for the involvement of MEK in ERK2 activation by SUL, we took advantage of a recently identified specific MEK inhibitor, PD98059 (39Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar). In solvent (0.1% Me2SO)-pretreated HepG2 cells, SUL strongly induced ERK2 activity; however, preincubation with 25 μm or 50 μm PD98059 completely blocked SUL activation of ERK2 (Fig. 3 B). PD98059 alone had no detectable effect on ERK2 activity compared with the control cells. In Hepa1c1c7 cells, PD98059 also blocked ERK2 activation by SUL (Fig. 3 C). Taken together, these data demonstrate that SUL, like tBHQ, induced MEK-dependent activation of ERK2. tBHQ and SUL induce many phase II detoxifying enzymes, such as GST, QR, and UDP-glucuronosyl transferase-glucuronosyltransferase. Experiments with Hepa1c1c7 cells showed that QR induction is a useful indicator of overall phase II enzyme induction (15Prochaska H.J. De Long M.J. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To provide first evidence for the involvement of ERK2 pathway in the regulation of phase II enzyme induction by SUL and tBHQ, we examined the effect of PD98059 on QR activity induced by tBHQ and SUL in Hepa1c1c7 cells. As shown in Fig.4, tBHQ (50 μm) and SUL (12.5 μm) significantly stimulated QR activity. Pretreatment with PD98059 caused a dose-dependent inhibition of tBHQ- and SUL-induced QR activity. However, PD98059 alone only slightly decreased the basal QR activity. These data suggest that the induction of phase II detoxifying enzymes by tBHQ and SUL may be regulated by an ERK-dependent mechanism. Previous studies have shown that the induction of phase II detoxifying enzymes by tBHQ and SUL is mediated by ARE (17Friling R.S. Bensimon A. Tichauer Y. Daniel V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6258-6262Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 18Rushmore T.H. Morton M.R. Pickett C.B. J. Biol.

A. 1993; 90: 2965-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Thus, we decided to examine whether the inhibitory effect of PD98059 on tBHQ- or SUL-induced QR activity was due to the inhibition of ARE-mediated gene expression. HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid construct containing a single copy of 41-base pair ARE enhancer linked to the GST Ya minimal promoter (base pairs −164 to +66)-CAT gene. Exposure of transfected HepG2 cells to 25 μm SUL caused a time-dependent induction of CAT activity (Fig.5 A). The induced CAT activity was seen as early as 4 h, immediately following the peak of ERK2 activation (Fig. 2 B). Pretreatment with PD98059 (25 μm) substantially reduced the induction of reporter gene activity by SUL (Fig. 5 A). tBHQ (100 μm) also strongly induced CAT activity, which was inhibited by PD98059 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5 B). PD98059 alone only slightly decreased CAT activity as compared with the control cells (treated with 0.1% Me2SO). When the cells transfected with a CAT construct containing GST Ya minimal promoter but lacking ARE enhancer were stimulated with SUL or tBHQ, no induction of CAT activity was observed (Fig. 5 C). These data provide strong evidence for the role of ERK2 pathway in ARE-mediated phase II enzyme induction by SUL and tBHQ. Interestingly, SUL-stimulated ERK2 activity was transient, peaking at 90 min (Fig. 1 B), whereas the stimulated ARE reporter gene activity was prolonged and continued to increase even up to 24 h after stimulation with SUL (Fig. 5 A). Although the exact reasons for such a lasting induction are not clear, it is possible that ERK2 activity may be only required for the initiation of downstream signals that are responsible for induction of ARE-dependent gene expression. Another interesting observation is that PD98059 inhibited the induction of ARE reporter gene in a time-dependent fashion. PD98059 almost completely blocked the induction of ARE activity at 4 and 8 h; however, it only partially inhibited the induction at later time points (12 and 24 h). Given that PD98059 at 25 μm exhibited similar inhibitory effect on ERK activation as higher concentration of 50 μm (Fig. 3, B and C) but showed less inhibition on ARE inhibitory (Fig. 5 B), we speculate that a weak ERK activation (in the presence of 25 μmPD98059) may be undetectable in our system, but it sufficed to amplify the downstream effectors, contributing to such an incomplete inhibition by PD98059. Alternatively, a prolonged treatment with SUL or tBHQ may generate a second signaling event that leads to ERK-independent activation of ARE reporter gene, which could also contribute to the sustained induction as seen in this study. To corroborate our experiment, we examined the effect of overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of ERK2 on SUL- and tBHQ-induced ARE-luciferase reporter gene activity. To do so, we first tested the inducible activity of ARE-luciferase reporter gene by SUL and tBHQ. HepG2 cells were either transfected with ARE-linked luciferase reporter construct (ARE-TI-Luc) or with the construct (TI-Luc) that lacks ARE enhancer. After transfection, cells were exposed to SUL or tBHQ for 24 h, and the luciferase activity was assayed as described under “Materials and Methods.” As shown in Fig.6 A, both SUL and tBHQ strongly induced luciferase activity in HepG2 cells transfected with ARE-TI-Luc construct but not in the cells transfected with the TI-Luc construct. Furthermore, a much lower basal luciferase activity was observed in TI-Luc-transfected cells than that in ARE-TI-Luc-transfected cells. Thus, consistent with the previous results, ARE is a regulatory sequence responsible for the high basal as well as the inducible activities of phase II enzymes. Co-transfection of ARE-luciferase reporter with a dominant-negative ERK2 mutant, ERK2(KR), significantly decreased the luciferase activity induced by SUL (25 μm) and tBHQ (100 μm) in a dose-dependent manner but had little effect on the basal activity (Fig. 6 B). Overexpression of ERK2(KR) also significantly reduced SUL and tBHQ activation of ERK2 in a dose-dependent manner similar to that in luciferase assays (Fig. 6 C). Therefore, these data substantiate the role or ERK2 pathway in the induction of ARE-dependent gene express"
https://openalex.org/W2049439285,"Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is known to prevent apoptosis induced by diverse stimuli. The present study examined the effect of IGF-I on the promoter activity ofbcl-2, a gene with antiapoptotic function. A luciferase reporter driven by the promoter region of bcl-2 from −1640 to −1287 base pairs upstream of the translation start site containing a cAMP-response element was used in transient transfection assays. Treatment of PC12 cells with IGF-I enhanced the bcl-2promoter activity by 2.3-fold, which was inhibited significantly (p < 0.01) by SB203580, an inhibitor of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Cotransfection of thebcl-2 promoter with MAPK kinase 6 and the β isozyme of p38 MAPK resulted in 2–3-fold increase in the reporter activity. The dominant negative form of MAPKAP-K3, a downstream kinase activated by p38 MAPK, and the dominant negative form of cAMP-response element-binding protein, inhibited the reporter gene activation by IGF-I and p38β MAPK significantly (p < 0.01). IGF-I increased the activity of p38β MAPK introduced into the cells by adenoviral infection. Thus, we have characterized a novel signaling pathway (MAPK kinase 6/p38β MAPK/MAPKAP-K3) that defines a transcriptional mechanism for the induction of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 by IGF-I through the nuclear transcription factor cAMP-response element-binding protein in PC12 cells. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is known to prevent apoptosis induced by diverse stimuli.

They include proapoptotic (Bax, Bad, Bid, and Bik) and antiapoptotic (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Brag-1) proteins (1Merry D. Korsmeyer S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 245-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Complex interplay between these two groups of proteins seems to decide the fate of cells when exposed to apoptotic stimuli. In transgenic mice overexpressing the bcl-2 gene, the loss of neuronal cells by natural cell death as well as experimental ischemia is significantly reduced (2Martinou J.-C. Dubois-Dauphin M. Staple J.K. Rodriguez I. Frankoowski H. Missotten M. Albertini P. Talabot D. Catsicas S. Pietra C. Huarte J. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1017-1030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). In bcl-2 gene-ablated mice, loss of neurons and apoptosis in thymus and spleen has been observed (3Veis D. Sorenson C. Shutter J. Korsmeyer S. Cell. 1993; 75: 229-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar). The expression pattern of Bcl-2 during murine embryogenesis by immunohistochemical analysis shows that this protein is restricted to zones of survival (4Novack D. Korsmeyer S. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 61-73PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, expression of Bcl-2 appears to be a key regulatory step in promoting cell survival. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I)1 is known to exert antiapoptotic action in several cell types. One of the mechanisms by which IGF-I promotes cell survival is through down-regulation of the proapoptotic protein Bad. IGF-I stimulates the phosphorylation of Bad by activating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt, leading to the sequestration of phospho-Bad in cytosol by the protein 14-3-3 (5Kulik G. Weber M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6711-6718Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In addition to this cytosolic covalent modification, IGF-I-mediated expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL could play a role in the promotion of cell survival (6Párrizas M. LeRoith D. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1355-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). This growth factor has been shown to inhibit the down-regulation of Bcl-2 protein induced by hypoxia in cultured rat cortical neurons and by interleukin-3 deprivation in murine myeloid progenitor cells (7Tamatani M. Ogawa S. Tohyama M. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 58: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 8Minshall C. Arkins S. Straza J. Conners J. Dantzer R. Freund G. Kelley K. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1225-1232PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which IGF-I sustains the expression of bcl-2 has not been studied. IGF-I is likely to increase the bcl-2 expression at the transcriptional level, since bcl-2 promoter is positively regulated by the nuclear transcription factor CREB, and IGF-I can activate this transcription factor (9Pugazhenthi S.

The bcl-2gene consists of three exons with an untranslated first exon. It has a TATA-less GC-rich promoter with positive and negative regulatory elements (10Young R.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3686-3697Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 11Chen H.-M. Boxer L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3840-3847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Wilson B.E. Mochon E. Boxer L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5546-5556Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The presence of a CRE site in a region between −1526 and −1552 upstream of the translation start site has been reported (12Wilson B.E. Mochon E. Boxer L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5546-5556Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of CREB by PKC in B lymphocytes leads to induction of the bcl-2 gene in a CRE-dependent fashion and protection from apoptosis (12Wilson B.E. Mochon E. Boxer L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5546-5556Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). In a recent study, we demonstrated that insulin-like growth factor-I-induced CREB activation involves p38 MAPK-mediated signaling pathway in PC12 cells (9Pugazhenthi S. Boras T. O'Connor D. Meintzer M.K. Heidenreich K.A. Reusch J.E.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2829-2837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Hence, activation of p38 MAPK could stimulate the bcl-2 promoter activity through CREB in these cells. The p38 MAPK belongs to the MAPK superfamily, the other members being extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and stress-activated protein kinase/N-terminal Jun kinase. Activation of p38 MAPK has been observed during apoptosis mediated by diverse stimuli such as growth factor withdrawal and exposure to UV irradiation (13Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5036) Google Scholar). p38 MAP kinase is important for programmed cell death, since its specific inhibitor SB203580 can prevent apoptosis (14Kummer J.L. Rao P.K. Heidenreich K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20490-20494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). However, studies have demonstrated that p38 MAPK can be activated by growth factors, leading to induction of growth-promoting genes (9Pugazhenthi S. Boras T. O'Connor D. Meintzer M.K.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1946-1955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Differentiation of PC12 cells into a neuronal cell type and adipogenesis have been shown to require p38 MAPK (16Engelman J.A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 24285-24288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The apparent discrepancy between these observations can probably be explained by the existence of several p38 MAPK isozymes with distinct functions. So far, four isozymes, α, β, γ, and δ, have been identified with several splice variants (18Jiang Y. Chen C. Li Z. Guo W. Gegner J.A. Lin S. Han J. J. Biol.

In cardiomyocytes, β isozyme was shown to exert hypertrophic action, whereas p38α induces apoptosis (22Wang Y. Huang S. Sah V.P. Ross Jr., J. Brown J.H. Han J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2161-2168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Identification of isoform specific regulation by trophic versus toxic factors should clarify this confusing scenario. The objectives of the present investigation were (a) to examine the IGF-I mediated activation of bcl-2 promoter in PC12 cells and characterize the signaling pathway involved in this activation and (b) to examine the isozyme specific role of p38 MAPK in the activation of bcl-2 promoter. We demonstrate that IGF-I-induced bcl-2 promoter activity proceeds in part through a novel signaling pathway involving MAPK kinase 6/p38β MAPK/MAPKAP-K3 and requires CREB.

PD98059 was purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Different promoter regions of the bcl-2 gene (full-length, −3934 to −1287; truncated with CRE site, −1640 to 1287; truncated without CRE −1526 to −1287; and the CRE mutated (−1640 to 1287)) were linked to luciferase reporter as described previously (12Wilson B.E.

Plasmids for transfection experiments were purified using Qiagen's (Valencia, CA) Maxi kit. Anti-FLAG antibody and other fine chemicals were purchased from Sigma. cDNA encoding full-length FLAG epitope-tagged p38β or MAPK kinase 6 (WT) were subcloned into HindIII and XbaI sites in the plasmid pACCMVpLpA, which includes the left end of the adenovirus chromosome with the E1A gene and the 5′-half of theE1B gene replaced by the cytomegalovirus major immediate early promoter, a multiple cloning site, and intron and polyadenylation sequences from SV40 (23Gomez-Foix A.M.

Cells were grown until the positive cytopathic effect was evident (7–10 days). Medium from these cells was harvested and freeze-thawed to release virus, and serial dilutions were used to infect 293 cells for plaque purification. The cells were overlaid with 1% Noble agar containing medium and serum 18 h after infection and fed with fresh Noble agar/medium/serum after 4 days. On day 7, the cells were stained with neutral red, and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-b-d-galactopyranoside was added to Noble agar containing medium with serum. Clear plaques, which include viruses arising from homologous recombination between the recombinant plasmid and the right (large) arm of Ad5dl327Bstβ-gal-TP complex, were picked and grown in 293 cells, and positive recombinants were identified by Western analysis using the FLAG antibody. Virus was propagated and purified by CsCl gradient centrifugation (28Jones N. Shenk T. Cell. 1978; 13: 181-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells (provided by Dr. Gary Johnson, Denver, CO) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 5% heat-inactivated horse serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 microunits/ml penicillin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere at 8% CO2. Cells were cultured in 6 × 35-mm wells for transfection studies. Medium was changed every second day. Confluent cell cultures were split 1:4 and used for the experiments 4 days later. The cells were fasted for five h by maintaining in the medium containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum and 0.05% heat-inactivated horse serum before treatment with growth factors and other agents in the experiments for measuring CREB phosphorylation. Stock solutions of the pharmacological inhibitor SB203580 and PD98059 were prepared in Me2SO at a concentration of 1000-fold, so that when it was added to the culture medium, the concentration of Me2SO was 0.1%. Immunoblotting for phospho-CREB, dual phospho-p38 MAPK, and Bcl-2 was carried out as described previously (9Pugazhenthi S. Boras T. O'Connor D. Meintzer M.K. Heidenreich K.A. Reusch J.E.-B. J. Biol.

After treatment with insulin-like growth factor-I for an appropriate duration, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and total cell lysates were prepared by scraping the cells with 200 μl of 1× Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol. The proteins were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The blots were blocked with TBST (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, 8.5% NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dry milk (blotting grade) at room temperature for 1 h. The blots were then treated with the primary antibody for phospho-p38 MAPK/phospho-CREB/Bcl-2 in TBST containing 5% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C overnight. After three washes with blocking buffer, the blots were incubated with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase for 1 h at room temperature. This was followed by three washes with blocking buffer, two washes with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.5), 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and a 5-min incubation with diluted CDP-Star reagent (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and then exposed to x-ray film. The intensity of bands was quantitated by scanning. The PC12 cells were infected with adenoviral p38β linked to FLAG epitope and MAPK kinase 6 (WT) and exposed to IGF-I as described in the legend to Fig. 7. After washing the cells with PBS, 200 μl of ice-cold cell lysis buffer (20 mmTris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 500 nm okadaic acid, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was added. The cells were scraped, lysed by sonication, and centrifuged for 20 min. The supernatant (300 μg of protein) was mixed with 15 μg of FLAG antibody overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose (20 μl) was added and gently rocked for 3 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the pellet was washed twice with cell lysis buffer and twice with kinase assay buffer (25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mmMgCl2). The pellet was suspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer with 200 μm ATP and 2 μg of ATF-2 fusion protein and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 4× Laemmli sample buffer. These samples were electrophoresed and immunoblotted with antibody to phospho-ATF-2. The intensities of the bands were measured by scanning. Transient transfection was carried out using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). PC12 cells were cultured to 60–80% confluence for transfection experiments in 6 × 35-mm plates. For each well, 1 μg of plasmids, 3 μl of Plus reagent, and 10 μg of LipofectAMINE reagent were used as per the manufacturer's instructions. The plasmid containing the β-galactosidase gene driven by the SV40 promoter was included to normalize the transfection efficiency. DNA and the LipofectAMINE reagent were diluted separately in 100 μl of serum-free medium without antibiotics, mixed together, and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The culture plates were washed with PBS, and 800 μl of serum- and antibiotic-free medium was added. The 200 μl of the plasmid LipofectAMINE mixture was then added to each well, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 5 h. Then 1.0 ml of high serum medium (20% fetal bovine serum and 10% heat-inactivated horse serum) was added, and the cells were incubated for approximately 24 h before induction with growth factors for luciferase for 24 h. The cells were washed in PBS and lysed with 100 μl of reporter lysis buffer. The cells were lysed by freezing and thawing, and lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 RPM for 30 min. The supernatant was used for the assay of luciferase and β-galactosidase. Luciferase assays were carried out using the enhanced luciferase assay kit (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA) on a Monolight 2010 luminometer. The β-galactosidase assay was performed according to the method of Wadzinski et al. (29Wadzinski B. Wheat W. Jaspers S. Peruski L. Lickteig R. Johnson G. Klemm D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2822-2834Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was carried out by Student's ttest. Previous studies have shown the regulation ofbcl-2 promoter activity by positive and negative regulatory elements in the 5′ upstream region (10Young R.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell.

To explore the importance of CRE in bcl-2 expression, we first characterized these regulatory regions of bcl-2 promoter in PC12 cells. The sequence from −3934 to −1287 was able to drive the expression of a luciferase gene from a promoterless reporter construct (Fig.1). Truncation of the 5′-end from −3934 to −1640 led to a 2.5-fold increase in the promoter activity (Fig. 1). This increase seems to be due to the loss of negative regulatory regions identified by previous studies (10Young R.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3686-3697Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 11Chen H.-M. Boxer L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3840-3847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This truncated promoter region contains a CRE site between −1611 and −1526. Mutation of the CRE site decreased the luciferase activity by 50%. Additionally, cotransfection of the CRE-containing reporter construct with dominant negative CREB (KCREB) significantly (p < 0.001) decreased the luciferase induction. Progressive deletion from the 5′-end of the CRE site-containing region resulted in a 68% decrease of reporter activity. These experiments clearly demonstrate the positive regulation of basal bcl-2 promoter activity by the nuclear transcription factor CREB. IGF-I is known to up-regulate the expression of the pro-cell survival protein Bcl-xL (30Parrizas M. LeRoith D. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1355-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). We wanted to examine if this growth factor can increase the expression of Bcl-2. When PC12 cells were treated with 50 and 100 ng/ml concentrations of IGF-I, there was a significant (p < 0.001) increase in the expression of Bcl-2 as shown by the immunoblot (Fig.2 A). To understand the mechanism by which IGF-I stimulates the expression of Bcl-2, we examined the effect of this growth factor on the promoter activity ofbcl-2 gene. When PC12 cells were transiently transfected with a luciferase reporter driven by the CRE site containing truncatedbcl-2 promoter, IGF-I (100 ng/ml) was also able to increase its activity in a time-dependent manner (Fig.2 B). Treatment of the PC12 cells with this growth factor for 18 h led to a 2.3-fold increase in the bcl-2 promoter activity over the untreated cells. When the promoter was cotransfected with dominant negative CREB, IGF-I stimulated reporter activity was decreased by 46% (Table I), indicating that this growth factor induces bcl-2 promoter through activation of CREB.Table IEffect of KCREB on IGF- and p38β MAPK-mediated activation of bcl-2 promoterCotransfection and treatmentCotransfection of reporter with KCREBWithout KCREBWith KCREBControl10051.0 ± 3.5ap < 0.001.IGF-I (100 ng/ml)231.7 ± 25.3124.3 ± 11.9ap < 0.001.MKK6 (Glu)206.0 ± 13.6101.0 ± 12.3ap < 0.001.p38β MAPK224.7 ± 18.0118.7 ± 16.8ap < 0.001.p38β MAPK + IGF-I373.3 ± 52.5182.0 ± 30.1ap < 0.001.PC12 cells cultured in 6 × 35-mm wells to 60–75% confluence were transfected with CRE site-containing bcl-2 promoter linked to luciferase reporter along with indicated plasmids in serum- and antibiotic-free medium.

Having shown the role of CREB in driving thebcl-2 promoter and its induction by IGF-I, we then proceeded to examine the signaling pathways known to be stimulated by IGF-I that are involved in phosphorylation of CREB on serine 133. CREB has been shown to be phosphorylated and activated by signaling cascades mediated by protein kinase A, protein kinase C, Ca2+, Ras, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. In a recent study, we demonstrated that IGF-I-stimulated induction of chromogranin A, a neuroendocrine-specific gene responsive to CREB activation, involves the signaling mediated by MAPK kinase 6 and p38 MAPK (9Pugazhenthi S. Boras T. O'Connor D. Meintzer M.K. Heidenreich K.A. Reusch J.E.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2829-2837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Hence, we examined the stimulation ofbcl-2 promoter activity by IGF-I in the presence of pharmacological inhibitors specific for different MAP kinases. The transfected cells were preincubated with PD98059 (40 μm), an inhibitor of MAPK kinase 1/2 (and therefore extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2) and SB203580 (10 μm), a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK (Fig. 3). IGF-I-stimulated reporter activity was decreased (40%;p < 0.01) by SB203580 (Fig. 3). The MAPK kinase inhibitor (PD98059), on the other hand, increased the bcl-2promoter activity by 80% (p < 0.001) and 52% (p < 0.01) in the absence and presence of IGF-I (Fig.3). The bcl-2 gene has been shown to contain negative regulatory elements that respond to the Ets family of proteins, which are activated through the MAPK kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway (11Chen H.-M. Boxer L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3840-3847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies are needed to examine this pathway. The results of the experiments with SB203580 demonstrate the involvement of p38 MAPK-mediated signaling pathway in the induction ofbcl-2 by IGF-I. We next examined the role of this pathway in the regulation of bcl-2 expression in more detail. In the next series of experiments in PC12 cells, the bcl-2reporter construct was cotransfected with wild type and dominant active forms of MAPK kinase 6, the upstream kinase known to activate p38 MAPK. The results of these studies indicated that MAPK kinase 6 is an activator of bcl-2 promoter (Fig.4). The wild type and constitutively active (Glu) forms of MAPK kinase 6 stimulated the luciferase activity by 2–3-fold (p < 0.001). MAPK kinase 6 (Glu)-mediatedbcl-2 promoter activity was decreased by 51% when the cells were cotransfected with KCREB (Table I). There were relatively smaller increases of 40 and 78% in promoter activity when cotransfected with wild type and constitutively active forms of MAPK kinase 3, respectively. This is likely to be due to differences observed in the activation pattern of p38 MAP kinases by MAPK kinase 3 and MAPK kinase 6. Among the isoforms of p38 MAPK, α, γ, and δ have been shown to be activated by both MAPK kinase 3 and MAPK kinase 6, whereas the β isoform is preferentially activated by MAPK kinase 6 (18Jiang Y.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1741-1748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). In order to specifically understand the role of p38 MAP kinase isoforms in regulating the bcl-2 promoter activity, we overexpressed them individually in PC12 cells. Among the various isozymes of p38 MAPK, β was found to stimulate bcl-2 promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.5 A). Coexpression of the reporter with 50–100 ng of p38β increased the activity by 2.1–2.8-fold. Although other isozymes of p38, α, γ, and δ, did show a small stimulation it was considerably less when compared with p38β. Optimal activation of p38 MAPK occurs when it is cotransfected with its upstream kinase, although previously it has been shown that p38 MAPK introduced alone is also activated by the endogenous pathway (18Jiang Y. Chen C. Li Z. Guo W. Gegner J.A. Lin S. Han J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17920-17926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). We further confirmed the role of MAPK kinase 6 and p38β MAPK inbcl-2 induction by using the specific inhibitor SB203580. This pyridinyl imadazole derivative has been shown to have an inhibitory effect in a highly specific manner toward p38 MAPK when compared with other MAPK family kinases such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase and N-terminal Jun kinase (32Cuenda A.

C129S, C131S, C437S, C449S, and C482S were similar to wild type receptor; the other 14 cysteine to serine mutants were retained intracellularly. Four of these, C60S, C101S, C358S and C395S, were unable to dimerize. A C129S/C131S double mutant failed to dimerize but was unique in that the monomeric form expressed at the cell surface. Substitution of a cysteine for serine 132 within the C129S/C131S mutant restored receptor dimerization. Mutation of residues Cys-129, Cys-131, and Ser-132, singly and in various combinations caused a left shift in Ca2+ response compared with wild type receptor. These results identify cysteines 129 and 131 as critical in formation of intermolecular disulfide bond(s) responsible for receptor dimerization. In a “venus flytrap” model of the receptor extracellular domain, Cys-129 and Cys-131 are located within a region protruding from one lobe of the flytrap.

We showed previously that individual cysteine → serine mutations of 14 of these 19 cysteines (all but cysteines 129, 131, 437, 449, and 482) abolish or drastically reduce receptor cell surface expression and/or function, likely by causing misfolding and improper processing of the receptor (18Fan G.F. Ray K. Zhao X.M. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In the present study, we performed a detailed analysis of ECD cysteines responsible for dimer formation. We found that mutation of both cysteines 129 and 131, but not mutation of either alone, blocks dimer formation. Unlike other ECD cysteine mutations, however, mutation of both cysteines 129 and 131 results in a monomeric form of the hCaR expressed at the cell surface and with unique functional properties. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on hCaR cDNA in the pCR3.1 vector using a commercial kit (QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, a pair of complementary primers with 25–35 bases was designed for each mutagenesis, and the mutation to change cysteine to serine or alanine was placed in the middle of the primers. Parental hCaR inserted in pCR3.1 was amplified using Pyrococcus furiosus DNA polymerase with these primers for 12 cycles in a DNA thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer). After digestion of the parental DNA withDpnI, the amplified DNA with the nucleotide substitution incorporated was transformed into Escherichia coli (DH-5α strain). The mutations were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing using a Taq DyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit and ABI prism-377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA). Most of the 19 single site cysteine to serine (Cys → Ser) mutants used in this study were described earlier (18Fan G.F. Ray K. Zhao X.M. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The C129S and S132C mutants and the Cys → Ala mutants including C60A, C101A, C358A, and C395A were newly generated. The C129S/C131S and C129A/C131A double mutants and the C129S/C131S/S132C triple mutant were created by changing cysteine at a given site to the desired amino acid and using this mutant DNA as template in the next round of mutagenesis. A truncation mutant containing the ECD and 1st transmembrane domain (henceforth termed TM1) was generated by introducing a stop codon in the first intracellular domain of the WT hCaR clone at amino acid position lysine 644. For all the newly generated mutants, we confirmed that two independent clones of the same mutant receptor cDNA showed identical properties. For transfection, a given amount of the plasmid DNA was diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (BioFluids Inc., Rockville, MD), mixed with diluted LipofectAMINE, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The DNA-LipofectAMINE complex was further diluted in serum-free DMEM, and 8–15 μg of DNA was added to 80–90% confluent HEK-293 cells plated in 75-cm2 flasks. For 6-well plates, transfections were performed using 2 μg of DNA for single plasmid transfection or 1 μg of DNA of each of two different plasmids in cotransfection experiments, with 25 μl of LipofectAMINE per well at dilutions described above. After 5 h of incubation, equal volume of DMEM containing 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (BioFluids Inc., Rockville, MD) was added, and the media were replaced 24 h after transfection with complete DMEM containing 10% FBS. Membrane protein extraction for immunoblotting, whole cell enzyme-linked immunoassay, or PI hydrolysis assay were performed 48 h after transfection. 48 h after transfection, cell surface proteins of the intact HEK-293 cells were labeled with membrane-impermeant Biotin-7-NHS using the cellular labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Briefly, adherent cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and treated with 50 μg/ml Biotin-7-NHS in biotinylation buffer (50 mm sodium borate, 150 mm NaCl) for 15 min at room temperature to biotinylate cell surface proteins. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 mm NH4Cl for 15 min on ice. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and solubilized with 1 ml of buffer B per well containing 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA with freshly added protease inhibitor mixture. 300 μl (approximately 600 μg of total protein) of the whole cell lysate prepared by scraping cells from 6-well plates in buffer B as described above was further diluted with 300 μl of buffer B and incubated with either 5 μl of 7F8 mouse monoclonal hCaR-specific antibody (made against the purified hCaR ECD (12Goldsmith P.K.

Subsequently, 25 μl of protein A/G (for 7F8) or protein A (for GGD)-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 1–2 h. The protein A/G- or A-agarose was washed three times with buffer B containing 0.5% SDS, and the immunoreactive proteins were eluted in 120 μl of 1× sample buffer containing either no β-mercaptoethanol or 300 mmβ-mercaptoethanol at room temperature for 5 min. 50 μl of sample was loaded per lane, and immunoblotting was performed as described below. Confluent cells in 75-cm2 or 6-well plates were rinsed with ice-cold PBS and scraped on ice in buffer B containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100 with freshly added protease inhibitors mixture. The protein content of each sample was determined by the modified Bradford method (Bio-Rad), and 40–60 μg of protein per lane was separated on 5% SDS-PAGE. The proteins on the gel were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with 0.1 μg/ml protein A-purified mouse monoclonal anti-hCaR antibody ADD (raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 214–235 of hCaR protein (25Goldsmith P.K. Fan G. Miller J.L. Rogers K.V. Spiegel A.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 1780-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar)). Subsequently, the membrane was incubated with a secondary goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) at a dilution of 1:5000. The hCaR protein was detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Corp.). Biotinylated proteins were detected using peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin followed by visualization of the biotinylated bands using BM chemiluminescence kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For cleavage with endoglycosidase H (Endo-H) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), cell extracts (20 μl) were diluted in 20 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.8). Samples were incubated with 0.5 milliunits of Endo-H for 2 h at 37 °C. This method has been described (26Ray K. Fan G.F. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol.

Briefly, intact transfected HEK-293 cells in 75-cm2 flasks were detached with 1 mm EDTA in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and incubated with 0.5 ml of DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1 μg/ml monoclonal anti-hCaR antibody 7F8 at 4 °C for 2 h. After incubation in peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody, cells were washed and, after adding peroxidase substrate, precipitated by centrifugation; absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 405 nm using a Thermomax microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).

Briefly, 24 h after transfection, transfected cells from a confluent 75-cm2 flask were replated in two 12-well plates in medium containing 3.0 μCi/ml [3H]myoinositol (NEN Life Science Products) in complete DMEM for another 24 h, followed by 1-h incubation with 1× PI buffer (120 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm KCl, 5.6 mm glucose, 0.4 mm MgCl2, 20 mm LiCl in 25 mm PIPES buffer, pH 7.2). After removal of PI buffer, cells were incubated for an additional 1 h with different concentrations of [Ca2+]o in PI buffer. The reactions were terminated by addition of 1 ml of acid/methanol (1:1000 v/v) per well. Total inositol phosphates were purified by chromatography on Dowex 1-X8 columns. The amino acid sequence for the hCaR ECD (20Garrett J.E. Capuano I.V. Hammerland L.G. Hung B.C. Brown E.M. Hebert S.C. Nemeth E.F. Fuller F. J. Biol.

A model for the three-dimensional structure of this portion of the hCaR ECD was generated using the SEGMOD algorithm (28Levitt M. J. Mol.

Biol. 1989; 206: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) using the LIVBP coordinates as a template from the Brookhaven Protein Data base. The modeled coordinates were oriented in RASMOL (30Sayle R.A. Milner-White E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2323) Google Scholar) and depicted using MOLSCRIPT (31Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) and RASTER3D (32Merritt E.A. Bacon D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 277: 505-524Crossref Scopus (3878) Google Scholar). To determine the role of the ECD in dimer formation of the membrane-bound hCaR, a mutant construct (TM1) containing the whole ECD and first transmembrane domain of hCaR and truncated at lysine 644 in the first intracellular loop was prepared and transiently expressed in HEK-293 cells. Cell surface proteins were labeled with membrane-impermeant Biotin-7-NHS prior to lysing the cells as described before (33Ray K. Clapp P. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34558-34567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To prevent nonspecific disulfide bond formation during protein extraction, the intact cells were incubated and washed in PBS containing 50 mm iodoacetamide, and 10 mm iodoacetamide was included in the lysis buffer. Both the wild type hCaR and TM1 were then immunoprecipitated with receptor-specific 7F8 monoclonal antibody and eluted with gel loading sample buffer either containing β-mercaptoethanol as reducing agent or with no β-mercaptoethanol. Immunoprecipitates were run on SDS-PAGE and analyzed on immunoblots stained either with streptavidin to detect biotinylated cell surface proteins or with anti-hCaR monoclonal antibody ADD to detect total hCaR immunoreactive species. As shown in Fig. 1 (ADD blot,1st lane), under nonreducing conditions, ADD antibody detected two major dimeric bands of hCaR ∼260–300 kDa in size; ∼150- and 130-kDa monomeric forms appeared only after reducing the samples (ADD blot, 3rd lane). Previous studies have shown that the monomeric ∼150-kDa band represents hCaR forms expressed at the cell surface and modified withN-linked, complex carbohydrates; the ∼130-kDa band represents high mannose-modified forms, trapped intracellularly and sensitive to Endo-H digestion (26Ray K. Fan G.F. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31355-31361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 33Ray K. Clapp P. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19537-19545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). In accord with this, streptavidin identified only the upper 150-kDa monomeric form under reducing conditions; under nonreducing conditions, only the upper dimeric form is stained by streptavidin indicating that only the upper dimeric form is expressed at the cell surface (Fig. 1,Biotin-Strep blot, 1st and 3rd lanes). Similarly, under nonreducing conditions (ADD blot,2nd lane), ADD antibody identified two TM1 mutant dimeric bands of ∼160–180 kDa. These forms were largely reduced to two bands of ∼85 and 95 kDa (ADD blot, 4th lane). Streptavidin detected only the upper form of the non-reduced or reduced TM1 bands (Biotin-Strep blot,2nd and 4th lanes) showing that only the upper form of TM1 is expressed at the cell surface, as with the wild type receptor. These results indicate that TM1 is capable of forming a dimer expressed at the cell surface like the wild type hCaR but lacking the full seven transmembrane domain does not stimulate PI hydrolysis in response to [Ca2+]o (data not shown). The ability of TM1 to form dimers, together with our previous observation that the secreted, purified ECD of the hCaR is a disulfide-linked dimer (12Goldsmith P.K. Fan G.F. Ray K. Shiloach J. McPhie P. Rogers K.V. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11303-11309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), indicates that the determinants including the cysteines important for dimer formation are present in the ECD of the hCaR. We previously generated single Cys → Ser mutants of all 19 cysteines in the hCaR ECD (18Fan G.F. Ray K. Zhao X.M. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We now coexpressed each of these Cys → Ser mutants and the wild type hCaR with the TM1 mutant and tested for their ability to heterodimerize with TM1 in a coimmunoprecipitation assay. A polyclonal antibody “GGD” made against a peptide from the carboxyl-terminal tail region of the hCaR is able to immunoprecipitate full-length wild type hCaR and full-length Cys → Ser mutants but not TM1 because TM1 lacks the GGD epitope. After immunoprecipitation with GGD antibody, samples were run on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and immunoblotting performed with ADD antibody whose epitope within the ECD is contained in both TM1 and full-length forms of hCaR. GGD antibody fails to immunoprecipitate TM1 when it is transfected by itself, as no immunoreactivity is detected on ADD immunoblots of such immunoprecipitates (data not shown). Fig.2 A shows the results for wild type and seven of these mutants. When coexpressed with wild type hCaR, TM1 immunoreactivity is detected with ADD on blots of the immunoprecipitate. Both the 95- and 85-kDa bands of TM1 were detected under reducing conditions as were the 150- and 130-kDa forms of the wild type hCaR (Fig. 2 A, 1st lane). These results indicate that TM1 and wild type hCaR heterodimerize, allowing TM1 to be coprecipitated with wild type hCaR by GGD antibody. We suggest that the upper forms of TM1 and wild type detected on ADD blot reflect heterodimers expressed at the cell surface and the lower forms, heterodimers of the respective incompletely processed, intracellular forms of TM1 and wild type hCaR. Similarly, with C129S and C131S mutants, both 95- and 85-kDa forms of TM1 were coimmunoprecipitated along with 150- and 130-kDa forms of the C129S and C131S mutant receptors. C236S mutant expressed primarily as the 130-kDa form and coimmunoprecipitated mainly with the lower 85-kDa form of TM1. A small amount of the upper 95-kDa TM1 monomeric band was detected corresponding to the faint 150-kDa band detected for C236S (Fig.2 A, 6th lane). In contrast, C60S, C101S, C358S, and C395S failed to immunoprecipitate the 95-kDa form of the TM1 mutant and little if any of the 85-kDa form. Each of these mutants was expressed primarily as the incompletely processed, 130-kDa form. The Cys → Ser mutants were further analyzed by determining their homodimerization patterns on ADD immunoblots run under nonreducing conditions. Cells were treated with iodoacetamide as described under “Materials and Methods” to prevent aggregates forming secondary to nonspecific disulfide bond formation. Fig. 2 B shows that C60S, C101S, C358S, and C395S mutant receptors remained mostly as a 130-kDa monomeric form and showed very little or no dimeric forms. In contrast, wild type hCaR, C129S, and C131S mutant receptors formed two homodimeric bands with little or no monomeric forms visible on immunoblot. C236S mutant receptor showed a strong dimeric band with mobility differing from either wild type hCaR, C129S, or C131S mutant receptors. Taken together, the results suggest that substituting serine (or alanine; data not shown) for cysteines 60, 101, 358, or 395 may directly or indirectly block dimerization, whereas serine substitution for either Cys-129 or Cys-131 has minimal effect on dimer formation. Substitution of serine for cysteine 236 does not block dimer formation, but the conformation of the C236S dimeric forms based on different mobility on SDS-PAGE appear to differ from those of wild type hCaR. Of the other Cys → Ser mutants, C447S, C449S, and C482S showed essentially the same pattern of hetero- and homodimerization as the wild type hCaR. The C542S, C546S, C561S, C562S, C565S, C568S, C582S, C585S, and C595S mutant receptors showed similar heterodimerization patterns with TM1 as the C236S mutant; their homodimerization patterns also resembled C236S with variable degrees of dimer mobility differences from wild type hCaR on non-reducing SDS-PAGE (data not shown). The first 17 kDa of the mGluR5 was shown to be critical for dimer formation (13Romano C. Yang W.L. O'Malley K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28612-28616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The mGluRs all have three conserved cysteines within this region. Two correspond to Cys-60 and Cys-101 of the hCaR, but the hCaR has two cysteines, 129 and 131, in the position corresponding to the third mGluR-conserved cysteine (20Garrett J.E. Capuano I.V. Hammerland L.G. Hung B.C. Brown E.M. Hebert S.C. Nemeth E.F. Fuller F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12919-12925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). This led us to examine the possibility that the lack of effect of serine substitution for either Cys-129 or Cys-131 on hCaR dimer formation could be due to the ability of the remaining, nearby cysteine to substitute in a putative intermolecular disulfide bond for that mutated to serine. We therefore created a C129S/C131S double mutant and compared its expression and dimer formation pattern with wild type, C129S, and C131S mutant receptors. As seen in Fig.3 A (ADD blot), under nonreducing conditions, a pair of immunoreactive bands in the"

Immunoblotting and Northern blotting with an antiserum against the enzyme and the cDNA, respectively, showed that a protein of approximately 67 kDa increased concomitantly with increase of mRNA of approximately 2.6 kilobases during granulocyte differentiation. During monocyte differentiation the same mRNA and protein increased as in granulocyte differentiation. Neither the enzyme activity nor the protein was found in macrophage-induced cells.

HL-60 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (General Scientific Laboratories) and 50 μg/ml kanamycin sulfate. For granulocyte differentiation, the cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 105 cells/ml and cultured in the presence of 1 μm RA or 1.25% Me2SO (25Yamada M. Kurahashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3021-3025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For monocyte/macrophage differentiation, the cells were cultured in the presence of 0.1 μm1α,25-(OH)2D3 or 10 ng/ml TPA (26Tsuchiya N. Kamei D. Takano A. Matsui T. Yamada M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1998; 123: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For TPA treatment, the cells were seeded at a density of 9 × 105 cells/ml. PAD activity was determined using BAEE as a substrate as described previously (15Watanabe K. Akiyama K. Hikichi K. Ohtsuka R. Okuyama A. Senshu T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 966: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Harvested HL-60 cells were resuspended at 2 × 108 cells/ml in a lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Triton X-100 and ruptured by freeze-thawing 3 times. The reaction mixture (50 μl) containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 10 mmCaCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmBAEE, and 25 μl of the cell lysate was incubated at 50 °C for 1 h. Then the reaction was stopped by adding 12.5 μl of 5m perchloric acid. The perchloric acid-soluble fraction was subjected to a colorimetric reaction with citrulline as a standard. The reaction was linear with time up to 3 h with cell lysates and recombinant enzyme under the assay conditions. One unit of the enzyme was defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the formation of 1 μmol of citrulline derivative in 1 h under the assay conditions. Kinetic parameters for BAEE and Bz-l-Arg were estimated from the activities assayed at 37 °C for 1 h from Lineweaver-Burk plots. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford with bovine serum albumin as a standard (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared from HL-60 cells treated with 1 μm RA for 3 days using a Fast Track mRNA isolation kit. cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA with oligo(dT)25 (dA/C/G) as a primer using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, followed by addition ofEcoRI-NotI-SalI adaptor and phosphorylation of the 5′ end using a Great Lengths cDNA synthesis kit (CLONTECH) according to the supplier's manual. The cDNA was ligated into an EcoRI site of λZAP II vector and then packaged at 22 °C for 2 h using Gigapack III GOLD phage extract. Approximately 5 × 105 plaques were screened by plaque hybridization with a32P-labeled rat PAD type II cDNA probe prepared by the random oligoprimer DNA labeling method (28Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16562) Google Scholar). Hybridization was carried out in a solution containing 5 × SSPE, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 1% SDS, and the probe (8 × 107 cpm/5 ng/ml) at 45 °C overnight. The membranes were washed twice with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature and 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 15 min. They were exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Positive cDNA clones were characterized by restriction enzyme digestions. Two PAD cDNA clones, 7-2 and 13-2, were chosen, subcloned into plasmids and sequenced. Clones with cDNAs for the 5′-end of the PAD were isolated by the 5′-RACE method (30Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4314) Google Scholar). A sample of 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from RA-treated HL-60 cells was reverse-transcribed with SuperScript IITM using an antisense primer (nt 360–342); 5′-CGGTGAGGTAGAGTAGAGC-3′. The first strand cDNA synthesized was polyguanylated with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. The second strand cDNA was synthesized with Expand Taq DNA polymerase using the polyguanylated cDNA as a template and a C primer; 5′-GGCCCGACGTCGCATGAATTCGCCCCCCCCCCCC-3′ and then the cDNA was amplified by PCR using an ApaI primer; 5′-GGGCCCGACGTCGCATG-3′ and a nested antisense primer (nt 329–310); 5′-AGTCTTGGGTCCGTAGTATG-3′. The PCR product was subcloned into pCR II and sequenced. The cycle sequencing reaction was performed using an IRD41-labeled primer and SequeTherm DNA polymerase by the chain termination method (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequences were determined with an Li-COR DNA sequencer, model 4000L. The current nucleotide sequence and protein sequence data bases were searched with a BLAST program (31Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68368) Google Scholar). Total RNAs were isolated from HL-60 cells by the acid guanidine thiocyanate method (32Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar) and poly(A)+RNA was isolated using an oligo(dT)-cellulose column (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The poly(A)+ RNA was separated by electrophoresis in denaturing 0.8% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde, transferred to a Hybond-N nylon membrane, and UV cross-linked (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The membrane was hybridized with a 32P-labeled full-length hPAD cDNA probe (8.5 × 106 cpm/6.3 ng/ml) in a solution of 50% formamide, 6 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS, 0.01% sonicated heat-denatured salmon sperm DNA, 5 × Denhart's solution, and 5% dextran sulfate at 42 °C for 24 h. The membranes were finally washed in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C, and autoradiographed as described above (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The entire coding sequence of PAD cDNA was constructed from a 5′-RACE cDNA and 7-2 cDNA by overhang extension by PCR. Briefly, a 5′-RACE cDNA was amplified using an M13 p8 primer (TOYOBO) and the antisense primer (nt 329–310) described above and then treated with T4 DNA polymerase to excise the 3′ extruded portion. The PCR product, whose 3′ end overlaps the 5′ end (nt 246–329) of the 7-2 cDNA sequence, was annealed with KpnI-cut 7-2 cDNA and elongated at 68 °C. The elongated product was amplified with a sense primer (hPAD-ex1: 27-mer) consisting of a 5′ EcoRI site (underlined) and a 19-nt sequence (nt 27–45): 5′-CCGAATTCATGGCCCAGGGGACATTGA-3′, an antisense primer (hPAD-ex2: 35-mer) consisting of a 5′ EcoRI-NotI site (underlined) and a 19-nt sequence (nt 2,093–2,075): 5′-CCGAATTCGCGGCCGCGAGCTCTTGCTTGCCACAC-3′ and Expand Taq DNA polymerase. The amplified cDNA was digested with EcoRI and subcloned into an EcoRI site of pGEX 4T-1 containing a thrombin site and named pGEX-hPAD. The hPAD cDNA was also subcloned into an EcoRI site of pGEX 6P-1 containing a 3C protease site. BL-21 cells transformed with pGEX-hPAD were grown in 2 × YT medium at 25 °C to a cell density of 1.0 at 600 nm and then after addition of 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for a further 5 h. The cells were resuspended in a lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100 and disrupted by 2–3 passages through a French press. The cell lysate was brought to a concentration of 1 m NaCl and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was loaded on a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column and the column was thoroughly washed with lysis buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl. The recombinant fusion protein was eluted with a solution of 10 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1m NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The yield of enzyme activity was about 26%. Purified GST-hPAD (360 μg) in complete Freund's adjuvant was injected into rabbits and then they were given a booster injection of the same antigen in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Anti-PAD serum was applied to a GST-Sepharose column. The unabsorbed fraction contained anti-PAD activity. An aliquot was diluted 100-fold with PBS(−) and then incubated with 280 μg/ml recombinant GST at room temperature for 20 min before use for immunoblotting. This preincubation was necessary for bleaching a nonspecific band of about 70 kDa. Sample proteins were subjected to SDS-10% PAGE by the method of Laemmli (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. For immunostaining of deiminated proteins, the membrane was treated at 37 °C for 3 h with the medium for chemically modifying citrulline residues and then modified citrulline residues were detected by coupled immunoreactions with rabbit anti-modified citrulline IgG (0.125 μg/ml) for 1 h and horseradish peroxidase conjugate of goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:5,000) for 1 h by a reported method (7Senshu T.

Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 94-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) with slight modification. Immunoblotting of PAD was performed using anti-GST-hPAD serum (1:3,000) or anti-rat type II PAD and bound IgG was detected with a horseradish peroxidase conjugate of goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:5,000) (Bio-Rad) using a chemiluminescence reagent kit, Renaissance (NEN Life Science Products). The blot was reprobed with anti-MPO serum (1:3,000) after deprobing with a solution of 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.5), 0.1 m 2-mercaptoethanol as described (34Kaufmann S.H. Ewing C.M. Shaper J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). When HL-60 cells were grown in the presence of RA, a granulocyte inducing agent, their PAD activity increased in the exponential phase of cell growth and reached a plateau in the stationary phase. No activity was detected in the absence of RA throughout the 3-day culture period (Fig.1, A and B). During cell growth in the presence of RA, the MPO activity of the cells rapidly decreased to about 10% of that of control cells, indicating differentiation of the HL-60 cells into granulocytes (Fig.1 C), as reported previously (25Yamada M. Kurahashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3021-3025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Various compounds are known to induce differentiation of HL-60 cells into granulocytes, monocytes, or macrophages (23Collins S.J. Blood. 1987; 70: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After additions of these compounds, the cells were examined for expression of PAD. TableI summarizes the effects of various differentiation inducers on the expressions of PAD in cells cultured for 2 days. Like RA, another granulocyte inducing agent, Me2SO also caused increase in PAD activity. The monocyte inducing agent 1α,25-(OH)2D3 increased PAD activity of the cells, while cells cultured with the macrophage inducing agent TPA, like control cells, did not show induction of PAD activity. The PAD in cells cultured with RA showed a ratio of activities to Bz-l-Arg and BAEE of about 1.5. The PAD in cells cultured with 1α,25-(OH)2D3 also showed similar activities to Bz-l-Arg and BAEE (data not shown). The ratios of the two HL-60 PADs differed from those of four known rat enzymes (1.0, 0.2, 0.2, and 0.2 for type I, II, III, and IV, respectively) (15Watanabe K. Akiyama K. Hikichi K. Ohtsuka R. Okuyama A. Senshu T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 966: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 16Terakawa H. Takahara H. Sugawara K. J. Biochem.

Open table in a new tab HL-60 cells were grown for 2 days in the absence or presence of the granulocyte inducers 1 μm RA and 1.25% Me2SO and the monocyte/macrophage inducers 0.1 μm1α,25-(OH)2D3 and 10 ng/ml TPA. PAD activities of the cell lysates were determined using BAEE as a substrate as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We then examined whether PADs produced in HL-60 cells also act on cellular proteins (Fig. 2 A). Lysates of cells cultured with RA or 1α,25-(OH)2D3 for 3 days were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with or without 10 mmCaCl2 and then subjected to SDS-PAGE. Deiminated proteins in the protein blots were probed with anti-modified citrulline IgG. On incubation with Ca2+, both the cell lysates showed numerous deiminated proteins migrating in a wide molecular weight range (lanes 5 and 6), but on incubation without Ca2+ no deiminated proteins were detected (lanes 2 and 3). Untreated cell lysates did not show any deiminated proteins, regardless of the presence or absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1 and 4). These results indicate that PADs in the RA cell lysates and 1α,25-(OH)2D3 cell lysates can deiminate various cellular proteins in the presence of Ca2+. In addition, the absence of detectable deiminated proteins in the intact cells suggested that a few proteins might be targeted slightly underin vivo conditions. Immunostaining of similar protein blots loaded with RA- and 1α,25-(OH)2D3 cell lysates containing 7 milliunits of PAD with anti-rat PAD type II IgG did not give any positive signals, although 2.8 and 14 milliunits of PAD of rat muscle PAD type II gave bands of about 72 kDa (Fig.2 C). This also suggested that the HL-60 PADs produced in cells cultured with RA or 1α,25-(OH)2D3differ from the type II enzyme. To isolate and characterize the HL-60 PAD, we used a cDNA cloning strategy. We constructed a cDNA library in λZAP II from HL-60 cells treated with RA for 3 days, and then screened the library by plaque hybridization with rat PAD type II cDNA as a probe. Two positive cDNA clones, 7-2 and 13-2, were selected and sequenced. Their sequences overlapped, but a sequence for a 5′ portion of PAD mRNA was missing. Thus, a 5′ portion of PAD cDNA was prepared by the 5′-RACE method. Several 5′-RACE cDNAs were obtained and sequenced. They had the same sequence. Three overlapping cDNAs were 5′-RACE cDNA (nt 1 to 329), 7-2 cDNA (nt 246 to 2, 286), and 13-2 cDNA (nt 1,374 to 2,286). Alignment of the 5′-RACE cDNA and the 7-2 and 13-2 cDNAs gave a full-length cDNA named human PAD V cDNA (hPAD V cDNA). The cDNA was 2,286 bp long, and consisted of a 5′-untranslated region of 26 bp, a coding region of 1,992 bp, a 3′-untranslated region of 268 bp including a polyadenylation signal, AATAAA (nt 2,236 to 2,241), and a poly(A) tail (nt 2,264 to 2,286). The coding sequence encoded a polypeptide of 663 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 74,100 Da. The calculated pI of the protein was 6.12. The deduced amino acid sequence showed 55, 50, and 55% identities with those of rat PAD types I, II, and III, respectively, and 73% identity with rat keratinocyte PAD type IV, whose distribution in cells and tissues is not yet known. The carboxyl two-thirds of the sequences were relatively conserved, while the sequences of their amino-terminal one-thirds were more divergent (data not shown). To express the above cloned PAD cDNA as a GST fusion protein inE. coli, we constructed the entire coding sequence (nt 27 to 2,093) of PAD from a 5′-RACE cDNA and a 7-2 cDNA by overhang extension and PCR and inserted it into the pGEX 4T-1 vector. An isolated construct of pGEX-hPAD contained one base substitution of G for A at nt 1,367, which did not result in any change in the amino acid sequence encoded by the original PAD cDNA. Cells transformed with pGEX-hPAD showed high PAD activity (specific activity 18.3 with BAEE as a substrate), but cells transformed with pGEX-hPADα containing the PAD cDNA in the reverse direction had no activity (data not shown). Most of the enzyme activity in cell extracts was recovered in a soluble fraction and then was affinity purified on a GSH-Sepharose column with a yield of 26%. The preparation gave a single major band of approximately 97 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Fig.3). Its specific activity (units/mg) was about 399, which was close to that of a homogeneous preparation of PAD type II purified from rat muscle. A GST-hPAD fusion protein was digested with PreScission 3C protease and then the recombinant enzyme was isolated. The activities of this enzyme on the synthetic substrates BAEE and Bz-l-Arg were studied at 37 °C. The kinetic parameters V max, K m,K cat, andK cat/K m for these substrates were estimated from Lineweaver-Burk plots (TableII). The K catvalue for BAEE was the same as that for Bz-l-Arg. TheK m for BAEE was larger than that for Bz-l-Arg. TheK cat/K m ratio for Bz-l-Arg was 1.5 times that for BAEE."
https://openalex.org/W2092354039,"Ligation of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) activates the Src family tyrosine kinase p56 Lck, which, in turn, phosphorylates a variety of intracellular substrates. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 are two Lck substrates that have been implicated in TCR signaling. In this study, we demonstrate that SHP-1 co-immunoprecipitates with the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K in Jurkat T cells, and that this association is increased by ligation of the TCR complex. Co-expression of SHP-1 and PI3K with a constitutively activated form of Lck in COS7 cells demonstrated the carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain of PI3K to inducibly associate with the full-length SHP-1 protein. By contrast, a truncated SHP-1 mutant lacking the Lck phosphorylation site (Tyr564) failed to bind p85. Wild-type but not catalytically inactive SHP-1 induced dephosphorylation of p85. Furthermore, expression of SHP-1 decreased PI3K enzyme activity in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates and phosphorylation of serine 473 in Akt, a process dependent on PI3K activity. These results indicate the presence of a functional interaction between PI3K and SHP-1 and suggest that PI3K signaling, which has been implicated in cell proliferation, apoptosis, cytoskeletal reorganization, and many other biological activities, can be regulated by SHP-1 in T lymphocytes.

Activation of protein tyrosine kinases and consequent intracellular protein phosphorylation are among the first events elicited by TCR ligation and are crucial to the induction of biochemical pathways that regulate cell growth (1Cantrell D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). This protein-tyrosine kinase activity, together with opposing protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity, plays a major role in regulating the magnitude of TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation, as well as the duration and termination of cell activation (1Cantrell D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 2Qian D. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The counterbalance of tyrosine kinases by tyrosine phosphatases is integral to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis (3Neet K. Hunter T. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 147-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 4Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar), and disruption of this balance has been shown to be a hallmark of cellular transformation (5Smith A. Ashworth A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R241-R243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). P56 Lck is a member of the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases which is highly expressed in T lymphocytes (6Weil R. Veillette A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 205: 63-87PubMed Google Scholar). Along with the Fyn Src family kinase and the ζ-associated protein 70 (ZAP-70), Lck has been implicated in the initial activation events resulting from TCR ligation (1Cantrell D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 2Qian D. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 6Weil R. Veillette A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 205: 63-87PubMed Google Scholar). Lck has been shown to associate with the CD4 and CD8 T cell surface antigens (6Weil R. Veillette A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 205: 63-87PubMed Google Scholar), and to play an integral role in the ligand-induced phosphorylation of the TCR intracellular components (1Cantrell D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar,2Qian D. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 6Weil R. Veillette A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 205: 63-87PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, Lck-mediated phosphorylation of the ζ subunit of the TCR and ZAP-70 couples TCR ligation to a variety of downstream signaling molecules (2Qian D. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), and the loss of Lck activity significantly reduces the capacity of the TCR to transduce activation signals (7Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). SHP-1 is an SH2 domain-containing non-receptor tyrosine phosphatase implicated in the negative regulation of a number of growth factor receptors, including the B and T cell antigen, erythropoeitin, the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGFR), c-kit, and the granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptors (8Siminovitch K.A.

As is consistent with an inhibitory effect of SHP-1 on TCR signaling, thymocytes from SHP-1-deficient viable motheaten exhibit a significantly increased proliferative response to stimulation by anti-CD3 antibodies as compared with normal mouse thymocytes (16Pani G.

PI3K consists of a p85 regulatory subunit with two SH2 domains and a SH3 domain, and a p110 catalytic subunit which phosphorylates the 3′-hydroxyl of the inositol ring of phosphatidylinositol (19Carpenter C.L.

Jurkat T cell activation via anti-CD3 antibody binding to the TCR complex has been shown to result in the rapid phosphorylation of both PI3K subunits (28von Willebrand M. Baier G. Couture C. Burn P.

Immunol. 1992; 22: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyr688 in the p85 subunit of PI3K and the consequent activation of PI3K have been linked to the presence of Lck (28von Willebrand M. Baier G. Couture C. Burn P. Mustelin T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 30von Willebrand M. Williams S. Saxena M. Gilman J. Tailor P. Jascur T. Amarante-Mendes G.P.

Gilman J. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14483-14488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, the phosphatase(s) that dephosphorylates PI3K has not been identified as of yet. In this study, we demonstrate that Lck activity is associated with an interaction of SHP-1 with the p85 subunit of PI3K, and also identify p85 as a target for SHP-1-mediated dephosphorylation. The association between p85 and SHP-1 requires tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-1 and likely involves binding of SHP-1 phosphotyrosine 564 to the p85 carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain via a novel tyrosine recognition motif. This interaction is also associated with a reduction in the lipid kinase activity in total anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates and a reduction in PI3K-mediated phosphorylation of Akt. Together, these findings implicate the interaction of SHP-1 with PI3K in the modulation of the PI3K signaling cascade downstream of TCR engagement. A monoclonal antibody against the ε chain of human CD3 complex (UCHT1, IgG1) was purified from cell culture supernatants of the hybridoma provided by Dr. Peter Beverly (University College, London, United Kingdom). The rabbit polyclonal antibody against Lck was described previously (32Mills G.B. Zhang N. Schmandt R. Fung M. Greene W. Mellors A. Hogg D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1991; 19: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (4G10, IgG1) and the rabbit polyclonal antibody against the p85 subunit of PI3K, and the rabbit polyclonal antibody against SHP-1 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Akt and phospho-Akt were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). A monoclonal antibody against hemagglutinin (12CA5, IgG1) was purified from cell culture supernatants of the hybridoma provided by Dr. Bing Su (University of Texas at Houston). Rabbit anti-mouse IgG was purchased from Western Blotting Inc. (Toronto, ON). Horseradish peroxidase goat anti-mouse IgG was purchased from Bio-Rad. Glutathione-Sepharose and protein A-Sepharose beads were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Piscataway, NJ). GST fusion proteins of the p85 SH2 domains were generous gifts of Dr. T. Pawson (Toronto, ON). The cDNA plasmid for activated Lck Y505F was a generous gift of Dr. A. Veillette (Montreal, QE). The cDNA plasmid for HAAkt was a generous gift of Dr. Julian Downward (London, United Kingdom). The cDNA plasmid for HAp85 and ΔHAp85 were described previously (33Adam L. Vadlamudi R. Kondapaka S.B.

Human Leukemic Jurkat T cell line E6.1, and COS7 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Jurkat T and COS7 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY) containing penicillin/streptomycin (1%, Life Technologies, Inc.), l-glutamine (2 mm, Life Technologies, Inc.), and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Sigma) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere. For CD3 cross-linking, cells were incubated with anti-CD3 (0.6 μg/ml) antibodies plus rabbit anti-mouse IgG (10 μg/ml) at room temperature for the indicated time periods. After stimulation, the cells were pelleted, resuspended in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mmZnCl2, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 50 mmsodium orthophosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Nonidet P-40) and incubated at 4 °C for 20 min. After centrifugation at 14,000 × gfor 5 min at 4 °C, post-nuclear detergent cell lysates were collected. COS7 cells were transfected by Lipofection. Briefly, 4 × 105 cells were seeded on 100-mm cell culture plates and incubated in complete media overnight. cDNA expression constructs were incubated in serum-free medium with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) at room temperature for 30 min, then diluted with serum-free medium and incubated with cells at 37 °C for 2 h, after which time the LipofectAMINE mixture was replaced with complete media and the cells were returned to 37 °C for 24 h. Complete media was then removed, the cells rinsed, and incubation continued with serum-free medium for an additional 24 h. Detergent cell lysates were incubated with the appropriate antibody as indicated (anti-HA, anti-p85) at 4 °C for 2 h followed by another 2-h incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads. The immunoprecipitates were washed with IP wash buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in 2 × Laemmli buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin and incubated with anti-p85 PI3K (1:1000), anti-phosphotyrosine (1:3000), or anti-SHP-1 (1:400) at room temperature for 2 h. Horseradish peroxidase-protein A or horseradish peroxidase-goat anti-mouse IgG was used as the secondary reagent. After extensive washing, the targeted proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham). Where indicated, blots were stripped by treatment with 2% SDS and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol in Tris-buffered saline and then reprobed with anti-p85 PI3K antibodies and detected by ECL. Transfected COS7 cells were starved for 24 h in serum-free medium. The cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Bacterial lysates containing the fusion protein GST alone, the p85 amino-terminal SH2 domain, or the p85 carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads. GST fusion protein beads were washed, then incubated with the transfected cell lysate at 4 °C for 2 h. After extensive washing, the proteins were eluted and immunoblotted as described above. Cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Cell lysates normalized for protein levels (BCA assay; Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL) were immunoprecipitated using anti-HA and protein A-Sepharose. Non-transfected COS7 lysate immunoprecipitates were included as a negative control. PI3K activity was determined as described (34Truitt K.E. Hicks C.M. Imboden J.B. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1071-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Briefly, the immunoprecipitates were washed sequentially in: (a) phosphate-buffered saline, 100 μm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100; (b) 100 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.5 m LiCl, 100 μm Na3VO4; (c) 100 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 100 μm Na3VO4; (d) 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 30 mm NaPPi, 200 μm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.03% Triton X-100, and resuspended in 30 μl of kinase reaction buffer (33 μm Tris, pH 7.6, 125 mm NaCl, 15 μm MgCl2, 200 μm adenosine, 15 μm ATP, 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). Phosphatidylinositol (PI) was resuspended in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, at 2 mg/ml and sonicated on ice for 10 min. The PI 3-kinase reaction was initiated by adding 10 μl of the PI suspension. The reaction proceeded for 30 min at room temperature and was terminated by adding 100 μl of 1 n HCl. Lipids were extracted by 600 μl of chloroform:methanol (1:1). The organic phase was washed with H2O, collected and dried by vacuum centifugation. The lipids were resuspended in 20 μl of chloroform:methanol (1:1) and resolved on Silica Gel G-60 thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plates in cloroform:methanol:NH4OH:H2O (60:47:2:11.3). Radiolabeled phosphatidylinositol phosphate was visualized by autoradiography. Cells were lysed in kinase lysis buffer (35Cone J.C. Lu Y. Trevillyan J.M. Bjorndahl J.M. Phillips C.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 2488-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cell lysates normalized for protein levels were immunoprecipitated using a rabbit antibody against human Lck and protein A-Sepharose. Non-transfected COS7 and SHP-1 transfected cell lysates were used as negative controls. After immunoprecipitation, the beads were washed four times with wash buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mmNa3VO4). The washed beads are then resuspended in 50 μl of kinase reaction mixture (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MnCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by washing the beads twice with wash buffer including 1 mm EDTA. Proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in 2 × Laemmli buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Radiolabeled Lck was visualized by autoradiography. Jurkat cells were incubated in serum-free RPMI for 16 h prior to stimulation. Cells were divided into two aliquots (25 × 106 cell each), and one was stimulated by cross-linking TCR complex proteins with anti-CD3 (see above) for 7 min. Membrane and cytosolic fractions were separated based on the protocol of Resh and Erickson (36Resh M.D. Erikson R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice with STE (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA) and collected with low speed centrifugation (1,000 × g). The cells were resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, 0.2 mmMgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmNaVO4, pH 7.4) and incubated on ice for 15 min. The cells were lysed with 30 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. Lysates were adjusted to 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet resuspended in 0.25m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and given five additional strokes in a Dounce homogenizer, and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were combined and centifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h. The resulting supernatant was labeled S100 (cytosolic), and the pellet labeled P100 (membrane). The P100 fraction was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. All samples were pre-cleared with protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. Both fractions were divided into two samples each, with one sample to be immunoprecipitated with anti-p85 antibody, and the other with rabbit anti-mouse antibody as a negative control. Although PI3K has been shown to be phosphorylated and activated following TCR ligation (28von Willebrand M. Baier G. Couture C. Burn P. Mustelin T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the phosphatase responsible for dephosphorylation of PI3K has yet to be identified. The tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 has been shown to target a number of molecules required for TCR signal relay (4Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). To address the possibility that PI3K represents a SHP-1 target, the capacity for SHP-1 to associate with PI3K in TCR-stimulated Jurkat cells was investigated by cross-linking the TCR complex with antibodies to CD3. We utilized a subcellular fractionation approach (36Resh M.D. Erikson R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) to maximize the yield of activated, membrane-associated PI3K and reduce dilution by non-activated PI3K. Results of immunoblotting analysis indicated SHP-1 to be present in p85 immunoprecipitates from the membrane fraction (Fig. 1 A, representative of three experiments) but not the cytosolic fractions of Jurkat T cells. TCR ligation resulted in a doubling, as assessed by densitometric analysis, of the amount of SHP-1 associated with p85 (Fig. 1,lanes 1 and 2), a result which is suggestive of recruitment of SHP-1 to a complex containing PI3K upon activation. Compatible with the presence of SHP-1 in PI3K immunoprecipitates, CD3 ligation induced a time-dependent increase in the amount of SHP-1 and PI3K present in membrane fraction anti-CD3 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1 B). The similar kinetics of association of SHP-1 and p85 with the TCR place these two signaling proteins at the activated TCR at the same time, and provide further evidence of a complex containing both SHP-1 and PI3K. Thus SHP-1, both constitutively and inducibly, associates with membrane bound and presumably activated PI3K in Jurkat cells (19Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 20Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Trends Biochem.

Acta. 1996; 1288: M11-M16PubMed Google Scholar), either directly or as part of a multimeric complex. Whether the baseline association of these proteins reflects constitutive activation of Jurkat cells, even in serum-free medium, remains to be determined. To determine the functional relationship between PI3K and SHP-1, we used a transient transfection system involving the expression of recombinant p85 and SHP-1 in COS7 cells. T cell receptor activation was simulated in this system by overexpression of a constitutively activated form of Lck (Lck Y505F) that was generated by mutating the regulatory carboxyl-terminal inhibitory tyrosine (6Weil R. Veillette A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 205: 63-87PubMed Google Scholar). In previous studies, the regulatory PI3K subunit p85 has been shown to be phosphorylated by Lck Y505F when these proteins are co-expressed in COS1 cells (30von Willebrand M. Williams S. Saxena M. Gilman J. Tailor P. Jascur T. Amarante-Mendes G.P. Green D.R. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3994-4000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The major site of Lck-induced p85 phosphorylation has been mapped to a tyrosine residue (Tyr688) located within the carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain (30von Willebrand M. Williams S. Saxena M. Gilman J. Tailor P. Jascur T. Amarante-Mendes G.P. Green D.R. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3994-4000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As Tyr564 in the SHP-1 carboxyl-terminal tail is also phosphorylated by Lck, and both p85 and SHP-1 contain SH2 domains, Lck-induced physical association of p85 with SHP-1 might be mediated by binding of the p85 SH2 domain(s) to phosphotyrosine on SHP-1. Alternatively, the SH2 domain of SHP-1 might inducibly associate with phosphorylated p85. To distinguish between these possibilities, the capacity of GST fusion proteins containing the p85 amino- or carboxyl-terminal SH2 domains to precipitate SHP-1 from lysates of transfected COS7 cells was examined. For these studies, the cells were transfected with a catalytically inactive form of SHP-1 (SHP-1 C453S) so as to prevent autodephosphorylation (18Lorenz U. Ravichandran K.S. Pei D. Walsh C.T. Burakoff S.J. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1824-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and thus maximize the level of SHP-1 phosphorylation. As illustrated by the anti-SHP-1 Western blot shown in Fig.2 A, the results of this analysis revealed only the carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain of p85 to bind SHP-1 C453S, and indicated this association to require the presence of Lck Y505F. By contrast, tyrosine-phosphorylated p85 was not precipitated by GST-SHP-1 SH2 domain fusion proteins (data not shown). To determine whether the major site on SHP-1 for Lck-mediated phosphorylation (18Lorenz U. Ravichandran K.S. Pei D. Walsh C.T. Burakoff S.J. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1824-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) was involved in the p85 SH2-mediated association between p85 and SHP-1, a truncation mutant construct (SHP-1 Δ35) encoding amino acids 1 through Lys560 of SHP-1 and thus lacking Tyr564, was derived and its capacity to associate with the p85 carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain then examined in the transfected COS7 cells. As illustrated by Fig. 2 B, immunoblot analysis revealed the failure of SHP-1 Δ35 to associate with the p85 carboxyl-terminal domain, and thus demonstrated this association to require one or more amino acids mapping within the Δ35 segment. As Tyr564, located within the last 35 amino acids of SHP-1, is the primary site of Lck phosphorylation in SHP-1, and Lck is required for the association of SHP-1 with the carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain of PI3K (Fig. 2 A), these data strongly suggest that it is the interaction of this phosphorylated residue with the p85 carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain which mediates physical association of p85 with SHP-1. Association of the p85 SH2 domain with the carboxyl terminus of SHP-1 creates the opportunity for SHP-1 to dephosphorylate Tyr688 of p85 (Fig. 2 C), the major site of Lck phosphorylation on p85 (30von Willebrand M.

https://openalex.org/W2035433195,"Previously, based on distinct requirement of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) and kinetics of triglyceride (TG) utilization, we concluded that assembly of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) containing B48 or B100 was achieved through different paths (Wang, Y., McLeod, R. S., and Yao, Z. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 12272–12278). To test if the apparent dual mechanisms were accounted for by apolipoprotein B (apoB) length, we studied VLDL assembly using transfected cells expressing various apoB forms (e.g. B64, B72, B80, and B100). For each apoB, enlargement of lipoprotein to form VLDL via bulk TG incorporation was induced by exogenous oleate, which could be blocked by MTP inhibitor BMS-197636 treatment. While particle enlargement was readily demonstrable by density ultracentrifugation for B64- and B72-VLDL, it was not obvious for B80- and B100-VLDL unless the VLDL was further resolved by cumulative rate flotation into VLDL1 (Sf > 100) and VLDL2 (Sf 20–100). BMS-197636 diminished B100 secretion in a dose-dependent manner (0.05–0.5 μm) and also blocked the particle enlargement from small to large B100-lipoproteins. These results yield a unified model that can accommodate VLDL assembly with all apoB forms, which invalidates our previous conclusion. To gain a better understanding of the MTP action, we examined the effect of BMS-197636 on lipid and apoB synthesis during VLDL assembly. While BMS-197636 (0.2 μm) entirely abolished B100-VLDL1 assembly/secretion, it did not affect B100 translation or translocation across the microsomal membrane, nor did it affect TG synthesis and cell TG mass. However, BMS-197636 drastically decreased accumulation of [3H]glycerol-labeled TG and TG mass within microsomal lumen. The decreased TG accumulation was not a result of impaired B100-VLDL assembly, because in cells treated with brefeldin A (0.2 μg/ml), the assembly of B100-VLDL was blocked yet lumenal TG accumulation was normal. Thus, MTP plays a role in facilitating accumulation of TG within microsomes, a prerequisite for the post-translational assembly of TG-enriched VLDL. Previously, based on distinct requirement of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) and kinetics of triglyceride (TG) utilization, we concluded that assembly of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) containing B48 or B100 was achieved through different paths (Wang, Y., McLeod, R.

While particle enlargement was readily demonstrable by density ultracentrifugation for B64- and B72-VLDL, it was not obvious for B80- and B100-VLDL unless the VLDL was further resolved by cumulative rate flotation into VLDL1 (Sf > 100) and VLDL2 (Sf 20–100). BMS-197636 diminished B100 secretion in a dose-dependent manner (0.05–0.5 μm) and also blocked the particle enlargement from small to large B100-lipoproteins. These results yield a unified model that can accommodate VLDL assembly with all apoB forms, which invalidates our previous conclusion. To gain a better understanding of the MTP action, we examined the effect of BMS-197636 on lipid and apoB synthesis during VLDL assembly. While BMS-197636 (0.2 μm) entirely abolished B100-VLDL1 assembly/secretion, it did not affect B100 translation or translocation across the microsomal membrane, nor did it affect TG synthesis and cell TG mass. However, BMS-197636 drastically decreased accumulation of [3H]glycerol-labeled TG and TG mass within microsomal lumen. The decreased TG accumulation was not a result of impaired B100-VLDL assembly, because in cells treated with brefeldin A (0.2 μg/ml), the assembly of B100-VLDL was blocked yet lumenal TG accumulation was normal. Thus, MTP plays a role in facilitating accumulation of TG within microsomes, a prerequisite for the post-translational assembly of TG-enriched VLDL. very low density lipoprotein triacylglycerol apolipoprotein B brefeldin A endoplasmic reticulum microsomal triglyceride transfer protein N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis thin layer chromatography phosphatidylcholine high density lipoprotein low density lipoprotein intermediate density lipoprotein The major function of hepatic very low density lipoproteins (VLDL)1 is to deliver triacylglycerol (TG) from the liver to peripheral tissues. Each VLDL particle contains a single copy of apolipoprotein B (apoB) and variable amounts of TG (1Elovson J. Chatterton J.E. Bell G.T. Schumaker V.N. Reuben M.A. Puppione D.L. Reeve Jr., J.R.

There are two forms of apoB proteins present in the plasma, the full-length B100 and a truncated B48 collinear with the N-terminal 48% of B100 (2Chan L. J. Biol.

In rats, however, the liver produces both B100 and B48, and both forms have the ability to assemble VLDL (1Elovson J. Chatterton J.E. Bell G.T. Schumaker V.N. Reuben M.A. Puppione D.L.

Known as the “two-step” model, it postulates that the initial product is a primordial small, dense particle, formed during or immediately after apoB translation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Subsequently, bulk lipid is incorporated into the primordial particle to form a mature VLDL (7Wang Y. McLeod R.S. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12272-12278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Under certain conditions, such as insufficient lipid supply or treatment of a low dose of brefeldin A (BfA), the assembly/secretion of mature VLDL are impaired whereas those of small, dense particles remain normal (7Wang Y.

One factor that plays an obligatory role in VLDL assembly is microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) (9Wetterau J.R. Lin M.C. Jamil H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1345: 136-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Defective MTP is the cause of abetalipoproteinemia, a recessive genetic disorder manifested by extremely low concentrations of plasma apoB (10Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Bouma M.-E. Eisenberg C.

MTP is a heterodimer that consists of protein disulfide isomerase and the 97-kDa catalytic subunit (9Wetterau J.R. Lin M.C. Jamil H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1345: 136-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The 97-kDa subunit is expressed mainly in intestine and liver, and has the ability to catalyze the transfer of various lipids between lipid surfaces in vitro (12Jamil H. Dickson Jr., J.K. Chu C.-H.

Inactivation of MTP in hepatic or intestinal cells invariably impairs apoB assembly and secretion (7Wang Y. McLeod R.S. Yao Z. J. Biol.

Although these studies have provided strong evidence that MTP is essential for apoB secretion as lipoproteins, our knowledge on the mechanism by which MTP facilitates VLDL assembly is incomplete and controversial. Initial transfection studies with non-hepatic cell lines (22Gordon D.A. Jamil H. Sharp D. Mullaney D. Yao Z. Gregg R.E. Wetterau J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14124-14133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) suggested that the major function of MTP was to assist translocation of apoB across the membrane of ER. Since it was believed that the formation of primordial dense particles took place during apoB translocation, some researchers postulated that MTP activity was essential only in the early stage of apoB lipidation (26Gordon D.A. Jamil H. Gregg R.E. Olofsson S.-O. Borén J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33047-33053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In the recent work showing post-translational B100-VLDL assembly, the notion that MTP was required for the “early phase” of assembly but not for bulk TG incorporation at the “late phase” was reinforced (3Rustaeus S. Stillemark P. Lindberg K. Gordon D. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5196-5203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Although plausible that MTP acts as a facilitator for apoB translocation, other studies cast some doubts on this conclusion. Experiments with cells (27Herscovitz H. Kritis A. Talianidis I. Zanni E. Zannis V. Small D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 659-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) or microsomal membranes (28Rusiñol A.E. Jamil H. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8019-8025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) that lack MTP expression have shown that apoB translocation and assembly into a primordial particle do not need MTP activity. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that the demand for MTP is much greater for bulk TG incorporation during VLDL assembly than that for primordial particle formation (7Wang Y. McLeod R.S. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12272-12278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 21van Greevenbroek M.M. Robertus-Teunissen M.G. Erkelens D.W. de Bruin T.W. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 173-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data raise the possibility that MTP may play a role other than assisting apoB translocation. Significant new insight into the requirement of MTP activity in VLDL assembly has been gained using stable McA-RH7777 cells. McA-RH7777 cells are the only hepatoma available that produces authentic VLDL but the level of endogenous apoB expression is low. Fortunately, these cells are suitable for stable transfection with recombinant apoBs. Studies conducted so far have consistently demonstrated that the ability of recombinant human B100 and B48 to assemble lipoprotein is indistinguishable from that of endogenous apoBs (29Hussain M.M. Zhao Y. Kancha R.K. Blackhart B.D. Yao Z. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 485-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 30McLeod R.S. Zhao Y. Selby S.L. Westerlund J. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2852-2862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Working with B48-transfected cells, we previously observed marked differences in the kinetics of TG utilization and in the sensitivity toward MTP inhibition between B48- and B100-VLDL assembly/secretion (7Wang Y. McLeod R.S. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12272-12278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). On the basis of these observations, we concluded that dual mechanisms operated in McA-RH7777 cells; while B48-VLDL assembly was achieved post-translationally, assembly of B100-VLDL was co-translational (7Wang Y. McLeod R.S. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12272-12278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, in these studies, no attention was given to the heterogeneity of B100-VLDL; hence, they were dealt with as a uniform fraction (d < 1.02 g/ml) without consideration of size differences (7Wang Y. McLeod R.S. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12272-12278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Because of this technical caveat, potential size enlargement accompanied with bulk TG incorporation into B100-VLDL was overlooked. In the current work, we studied VLDL assembly using transfected cells expressing various apoB forms (e.g. B64, B72, B80, and B100) to inquire if there were indeed dual mechanisms for the assembly of VLDL containing small or large apoB. Moreover, we resolved VLDL subclasses by size using cumulative rate flotation to determine if MTP activity was required for the formation of large, TG-rich VLDL. The present study has yielded a unified model that accommodates VLDL assembly with all apoB forms and nullifies the conclusion of dual assembly mechanisms. Also, we have found that MTP activity is crucial in the maintenance of a metabolically dynamic microsomal TG pool, which is essential for bulk TG incorporation during the final stage of B100-VLDL assembly.

Cell line that expressed B64 was prepared as follows. A DNA fragment extending from the MluI to MstI sites at nucleotides 7011 and 8848, respectively, was excised from pB100l-l (30McLeod R.S. Zhao Y. Selby S.L. Westerlund J. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2852-2862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After the MstI site was ligated with a KpnI linker, the fragment was inserted into pB53l-l (31Yao Z. Blackhart B.D. Johnson D.F. Taylor S.M. Haubold K.W. McCarthy B.J. J. Biol.

Stock solution of BfA (5 mg/ml) and MTP inhibitor BMS-197636 (20 mm) (designated compound 7) (32Wetterau J.R. Gregg R.E. Harrity T.W. Arbeeny C. Cap M. Connolly F. Chu C.-H. George R.J. Gordon D.A.

Science. 1998; 282: 751-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) were prepared in absolute ethanol and dimethyl sulfoxide, respectively. The TG transfer activity of MTP was measured using [14C]triolein and the deoxycholate extract of total cell homogenate according to the published protocol (10Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Bouma M.-E. Eisenberg C. Munck A. Hermier M. Schmitz J. Gay G. Rader D.J. Gregg R.E. Science. 1992; 258: 999-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Since the extensive dialysis required for the deoxycholate extraction precluded the assessment of BMS-197636 (a reversible inhibitor) effect on MTP, an alternative protocol (referred to as sonication extraction) was developed in which the cell homogenate was sonicated for 2 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation (400,000 × g, 16 min) of the sample, the supernatant that contained the MTP activity was used for TG transfer assay. The MTP activity in McA-RH7777 cells measured by the two protocols was comparable (data not shown). Metabolically labeled cells (100-mm dish) were suspended in 2 ml of Tris-sucrose buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 250 mm sucrose) that was supplemented with protease inhibitors (0.1 mmleupeptin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 unit/ml aprotinin, and 40 μg/ml ALLN). The cells were homogenized using a ball-bearing homogenizer (20 passages) (33McLeod R.S. Wang Y. Wang S. Rusiñol A. Links P. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18445-18455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and the postnuclear supernatant was obtained by centrifugation (10,000 ×g, 4 °C, 10 min). Heavy microsomes were isolated from the postnuclear supernatant by centrifugation using a microcentrifuge (16,000 × g, 4 °C, 15 min), and subsequently the light microsomes and cytosol were separated by centrifugation using a Beckman TLA-100.4 rotor (400,000 × g, 4 °C, 16 min). The heavy microsomes were enriched with ribosomal RNA as determined by ethidium bromide staining of total RNA separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. In some experiments, the heavy and light microsomes were combined (referred to as total microsomes). Heavy microsomes were resuspended in 200 μl of Tris-sucrose using a 25-gauge needle (five passages). Aliquots (60 μl) of the samples were incubated (30 min on ice) with or without 50 μg/ml trypsin and 1% (v/v) of Triton X-100. Trypsin digestion was terminated by the addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor (final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml). The samples were solubilized with an equal volume of lysis buffer (1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1% (w/v) deoxycholate, and 2% (w/v) SDS) for 16 h and diluted to 0.2% (w/v) SDS prior to immunoprecipitation with an anti-apoB antiserum (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). [35S]ApoB was analyzed by PAGE/fluorography as described previously (7Wang Y. McLeod R.S. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12272-12278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The total microsomes were rinsed twice with Tris-sucrose buffer to minimize cytosol contamination. The lumenal contents were released from total microsomes with 0.1 mm sodium carbonate, pH 11.3, by gentle mixing using a nutator for 30 min at room temperature. The lumenal contents were separated from microsomal membranes by ultracentrifugation (400,000 × g, 4 °C, 16 min). Conditioned media or the lumenal contents of microsomes were fractionated by cumulative rate flotation ultracentrifugation. Four ml of the sample was adjusted tod = 1.10 g/ml with KBr, and loaded onto the bottom of a Beckman SW40 centrifuge tube. The sample was overlaid with 3 ml ofd = 1.065 g/ml NaBr, 3 ml of d = 1.02 g/ml NaBr, and 3 ml of d = 1.006 g/ml NaCl. After ultracentrifugation (40,000 rpm, 20 °C, 148 min), VLDL1(Sf > 100) was collected from the top 1 ml of the gradient. After an additional ultracentrifugation (37,000 rpm, 15 °C, 18 h), VLDL2 (Sf20–100) and other lipoproteins were collected from top to bottom into 12 fractions. [35S]ApoB in each fraction was immunoprecipitated as described previously (7Wang Y. McLeod R.S. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12272-12278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In some experiments, the samples were fractionated by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation or sequential flotation ultracentrifugation (d = 1.02 g/ml) as described previously (7Wang Y. McLeod R.S. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12272-12278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). [3H]Lipids were extracted with CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (4:2:3; by volume) from cytosol, microsomal membrane, and microsomal lumen, and separated by TLC as described previously (7Wang Y. McLeod R.S. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12272-12278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The radioactivity associated with individual lipid species was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. The recovery of [3H]TG was nearly 100% for cytosol, microsomal membrane, and microsomal contents as determined by monitoring radioactivity associated with each fraction in comparison to that associated with total postnuclear supernatant. In some experiments, human and rat B100-VLDL were recovered by immunoadsorption under non-denaturing conditions as described previously (7Wang Y. McLeod R.S. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12272-12278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). [3H]Lipids associated with B100-VLDL were extracted and analyzed by TLC as described above. Protein (34Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and TG mass (35Neri B.P. Frings C.S. Clin. Chem. 1973; 19: 1201-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) were determined by published methods. Phosphatidylcholine (PC) mass was quantified using an assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Our previous study suggested that assembly of B100-VLDL and B48-VLDL took different paths (7Wang Y. McLeod R.S. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12272-12278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Here we systematically analyzed assembly/secretion of VLDL with B64, B72, B80, or B100 in an attempt to determine if the apparent dual mechanisms were accounted for by apoB length. Under basal culture conditions (i.e. DMEM + 20% serum), the buoyant density of secreted apoB-lipoproteins, as expected, was inversely related to apoB length. Thus, B64, B72, and B80/B100 were found predominantly in fractions with densities resembling those of high density lipoproteins (HDL), low density lipoproteins (LDL), and VLDL, respectively (Fig.1 A, panels labeled –OA). Upon supplementation with oleate, however, all apoB forms were secreted as VLDL (Fig. 1 A, panels labeled+OA). The enlargement of lipoprotein size was readily demonstrable for B64 and B72 by ultracentrifugation in a sucrose density gradient, but it was less evident for B80 and B100 because these proteins were already observed in VLDL (d < 1.02 g/ml) fraction even in the absence of oleate. Likewise, while the effect of MTP inhibitor BMS-197636 (0.2 μm) on oleate-stimulated [35S]B72-VLDL secretion was certainly observable (Fig. 1 B, a), evidence of the BMS-197636 effect on [35S]B100-VLDL secretion was not as clear although still discernible (Fig. 1 B, b). (The inhibitor BMS-197636, unlike the photoactivated inhibitor BMS-192951 used previously (7Wang Y. McLeod R.S. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12272-12278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), did not require ultraviolet treatment yet inhibited B100 secretion within 10 min of administration (data not shown).) These results led us to suspect that the supposed co-translational B100-VLDL assembly was a misinterpretation of data resulting from inadequate resolution of B100-VLDL (7Wang Y. McLeod R.S. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12272-12278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and that there was nothing but an imaginary dual mechanism for VLDL assembly in McA-RH7777 cells. In the following experiments, we used cumulative rate flotation technique to resolve B100-VLDL1 (Sf> 100) and -VLDL2 (Sf 20–100) from intermediate density lipoproteins (IDL)/LDL. Fig.2 A shows that, without oleate, B100 was secreted as VLDL2 and IDL/LDL, and that secretion of VLDL, particularly VLDL1, was stimulated by exogenous oleate. (Secretion of B100-VLDL1 was induced by oleate in a dose dependent manner (from 0.1 to 0.4 mm) with maximum stimulation at 0.4 mm (data not shown).) Separation of B100-VLDL subclasses by gradient gel electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions confirmed the size difference between VLDL1 and VLDL2 (Fig. 2 B,lanes 1–4), which was not as clear-cut as the quantum leap in particle size between B48-HDL and B48-VLDL (Fig. 2 B,lanes 5–8). The B100-VLDL1 contained ∼25% of total secreted [35S]B100 and contained 74% and 65% of respective total [3H]TG and [3H]PC associated with B100 (Table I). As a result, the ratios of [3H]TG/[35S]B100 and [3H]PC/[35S]B100 in VLDL1 are 8- and 5-fold, respectively, greater than those in VLDL2. Thus, the oleate-induced size enlargement of B100-VLDL (equivalent to a 2-fold increase in diameter) was accompanied with bulk TG incorporation, which was observable only after VLDL1 and VLDL2 were resolved.Table IComposition of VLDL1 and VLDL2 secreted from human B100-transfected McA-RH7777 cellsLipoproteins[35S]B100[3H]TG[3H]PCcpm × 10−2/mg cell proteinB100-VLDL1187.1 ± 9.8227.3 (1.2)16.5 (0.09)B100-VLDL2546.7 ± 41.581.9 (0.15)9.0 (0.02)VLDL1/VLDL20.342.81.8After being labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine or [3H]glycerol for 3 h with 0.4 mm oleate, B100-VLDL1 and B100-VLDL2 (both human and rat B100) were recovered from fractionated media by immunoprecipitation.

Multiple PAC1 receptor isoforms are suggested to determine differential peptide potency and receptor coupling to multiple intracellular signaling pathways. The current studies examined rat SCG PAC1 receptor splice variant expression and coupling to intracellular signaling pathways mediating PACAP-stimulated peptide release. PAC1 receptor mRNA was localized in over 90% of SCG neurons, which correlated with the cells expressing receptor protein. The neurons expressed the PAC1(short)HOP1 receptor but not VIP/PACAP-nonselective VPAC1 receptors; low VPAC2 receptor mRNA levels were restricted to ganglionic nonneuronal cells. PACAP27 and PACAP38 potently and efficaciously stimulated both cAMP and inositol phosphate production; inhibition of phospholipase C augmented PACAP-stimulated cAMP production, but inhibition of adenylyl cyclase did not alter stimulated inositol phosphate production. Phospholipase C inhibition blunted neuron peptide release, suggesting that the phosphatidylinositol pathway was a prominent component of the secretory response.

The PACAP-selective PAC1 receptor demonstrates high affinity for only PACAP38 and PACAP27 and is coupled to multiple intracellular signaling cascades. The VPAC1 and VPAC2receptors, in contrast, exhibit approximate equal high affinity for the PACAP38, PACAP27, and VIP peptides and are coupled to adenylyl cyclase.

Recent studies have suggested that PACAP peptides may be physiological regulators of sympathetic neuron function. PACAP has been identified in pericellular fiber networks enveloping SCG postganglionic neurons, and sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the spinal cord projecting to the SCG express PACAP (27Sundler F.

We demonstrated previously that PACAP peptides are potent and efficacious regulators of SCG neuron transmitter and peptide production, secretion, and mRNA with pharmacological profiles congruous for the PACAP-selective PAC1 receptor (30May V. Braas K.M. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 978-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 31Braas K.M. May V. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 805: 204-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Similarly, PACAP peptides selectively and potently stimulate sympathetic neuroblast mitogenesis, neuritogenesis, and survival and sympathetic neuron depolarization and membrane excitability (10May V.

The cellular targets of PACAP and the mechanisms underlying PACAP sympathetic actions, however, have remained unclear. To further evaluate the mechanisms mediating sympathetic neuron responses to PACAP, the present studies investigated SCG neuron expression of specific PAC1 receptor molecular forms and determined whether PACAP-stimulated receptor activation of specific second messenger pathways modulates peptide secretion. The analyses demonstrate the preferential expression of specific PACAP-selective receptor isoforms coupled to multiple intracellular signaling pathways in sympathetic neurons; PAC1 receptor stimulation of phospholipase C is a prominent component of SCG neuron neuropeptide Y (NPY) release. Adult male (225–250 g) and pregnant female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from Charles River Canada; all animal procedures were approved by the University of Vermont IACUC. Animals were decapitated, and SCG were removed and frozen. Neonatal (postnatal day 1) rat ganglia were obtained from mixed sex litters. Primary neuronal SCG cultures were prepared as described previously (30May V. Braas K.M. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 978-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 34May V. Brandenburg C.A.

Neonatal rat SCG enzymatically dispersed to produce a pooled population of cells were plated at a density of 1.5 × 104 neurons/cm2, treated with cytosine β-d-arabinofuranoside to eliminate nonneuronal cells, and maintained in defined complete serum-free medium containing 50 ng/ml nerve growth factor (34May V. Brandenburg C.A. Braas K.M. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4580-4591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For specific experiments, to obtain neuronal and nonneuronal cell populations, the SCG cells were preplated for 3 h; the neuronal cells were dislodged by agitation, recovered, and cultured in serum-free defined medium with mitotic inhibitors and nerve growth factor as described above. The remaining adherent cells were cultured as nonneuronal cells. PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 nutrient medium supplemented with 10% NuSerum and 5% fetal bovine serum.

The product was gel-purified and ligated into the EcoRV site of pBluescript II KS− cloning vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The nucleotide sequence of the insert was verified by automated fluorescent dideoxy dye terminator sequencing.

Conditioned medium from individual sympathetic neuron cultures (3 × 104 cells/well) was assayed using 1:9000 rabbit anti-NPY (RIN7180; Peninsula Laboratories, Belmont, CA) and 125I-NPY (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total RNA prepared using RNA STAT-60 total RNA/mRNA isolation reagent (Tel-Test “B”; Friendswood, TX), was used to synthesize first strand cDNA using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT) primers with the SuperScript Preamplification System (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (29Beaudet M.M.

Complementary DNA synthesis in the absence of either RNA or reverse transcriptase or amplification without template, primers, or DNA polymerase failed to yield products (data not shown). The identities of the amplified products were established by diagnostic restriction endonuclease analysis (43Rawlings S.R. Piuz I. Schlegel W. Bockaert J. Journot L. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2088-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Verification of HIP or HOP alternative splice variant expression was performed using sequence-specific hybridization as reported previously (38Brandenburg C.A. May V. Braas K.M. J.

Using a riboprobe that did not discriminate the PAC1 receptor transcript splice variants, hybridization was restricted to SCG principal neurons (Fig.1 A); almost all of the neurons were labeled. PAC1 receptor immunoreactivity directly paralleled the morphological localization of the receptor transcripts; nearly all of the sympathetic neurons exhibited PAC1receptor staining (Fig. 1 B). PC12 cells (Fig.1 F), which express PACAP-selective receptor mRNA and respond potently to PACAP, but not VIP (11Deutsch P.J. Sun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5108-5113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also stained, whereas no staining was observed in AtT-20/D16v cells (data not shown), which are regulated by both PACAP and VIP but express VPAC2 receptor transcripts (35Braas K.M. Brandenburg C.A. May V. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 186-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The cellular sites of the PAC1 receptor protein in the postganglionic neurons of the SCG were evaluated using purified primary cultured sympathetic neurons, which exhibited punctate PAC1receptor immunoreactivity localized predominantly to the soma (Fig.1 C). The cellular distribution of the PACAP-selective receptor protein, examined by fluorescent confocal microscopy, was over the plasma membrane often in patches that may represent receptor clusters (Fig. 1 D). Postganglionic sympathetic SCG neurons are catecholaminergic but are heterogenous with respect to neuropeptide expression. To demonstrate that the subpopulation of SCG neurons synthesizing NPY has the capability to selectively respond to PACAP, the neurons were dually labeled. Approximately 60% of SCG neurons expressed NPY immunoreactivity; all of the NPY-positive neurons coexpressed PAC1 receptor immunoreactivity (Fig. 1 E), implicating PACAP among prominent physiological regulators of sympathetic postganglionic neuron NPY expression. To define the signaling mechanisms underlying PACAP-elicited responses in sympathetic neurons, the molecular forms of PAC1 receptor mRNA were characterized. Multiple PAC1 receptor transcript isoforms that differ in either the amino-terminal extracellular region and/or the third intracellular cytoplasmic loop domain are synthesized in a tissue-specific manner by alternative splicing events (Fig.2). Alternative HIP and/or HOP exon usage in the PAC1 receptor mRNA encoding the third cytoplasmic loop was examined by reverse transcription-PCR, and amplification of cDNA from adult and neonatal rat SCG identified predominant expression of the one-exon isoform of the PAC1receptor mRNA (Fig. 3). Products corresponding to PAC1 receptor transcripts with neither cassette or with both cassettes represented relatively minor receptor species. Similar to the intact ganglia, purified principal sympathetic neurons maintained in vitro without extrinsic signals expressed predominantly the PAC1 receptor transcript with one cassette.Figure 3SCG express PAC1 receptor third cytoplasmic loop alternative splice variants. Complementary DNA templates were reverse transcribed from individual adult and neonatal rat SCG and primary sympathetic neuron culture total RNA. The region spanning the alternative splice site for the HIP and HOP exons within the third cytoplasmic loop was amplified using oligonucleotide primers PACAPR1 and PACAPR2 (top; Table I). Six third cytoplasmic loop isoform fragments containing neither, one, or both the HIP and HOP exon cassettes with the indicated sizes can be potentially amplified using these primers (left panel). The PAC1 receptor transcript schematic diagram (top) is based on the rat sequence (Ref. 23Spengler D. Waeber C. Pantaloni C. Holsboer F. Bockaert J. Seeburg P.H. Journot L.

https://openalex.org/W2044987273,"We investigated the role of protein kinase A (PKA) in regulation of the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) potassium channel activation. HERG clones with single mutations destroying one of four consensus PKA phosphorylation sites (S283A, S890A, T895A, S1137A), as well as one clone carrying all mutations with no PKA phosphorylation sites (HERG 4m) were constructed. These clones were expressed heterologously inXenopus oocytes, and HERG potassium currents were measured with the two microelectrode voltage clamp technique. Application of the cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE IV) inhibitor Ro-20–1724 (100 μm), which results in an increased cAMP level and PKA stimulation, induced a reduction of HERG wild type outward currents by 19.1% due to a shift in the activation curve of 12.4 mV. When 100 μm Ro-20–1724 was applied to the HERG 4mchannel, missing all PKA sites, there was no significant shift in the activation curve, and the current amplitude was not reduced. Furthermore, the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin that leads to PKA activation (400 μm, 60 min), shifted HERG wild type channel activation by 14.1 mV and reduced currents by 39.9%, whereas HERG 4m channels showed only a small shift of 4.3 mV and a weaker current reduction of 22.3%. We conclude that PKA regulates HERG channel activation, and direct phosphorylation of the HERG channel protein has a functional role that may be important in regulation of cardiac repolarization.

Activation of the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current,I Kr,1initiates repolarization and terminates the plateau phase of the cardiac action potential. The human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) (2Warmke J.E. Ganetzky B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These mutations are associated with delayed cardiac repolarization, prolonged electrocardiographic QT intervals (8Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Spector P.S. Keating M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is a key enzyme for numerous regulatory processes in almost all types of cells. It has been demonstrated that PKA regulates ion channels in native tissue (10Walsh K.B. Kass R.S. Science. 1988; 242: 67-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). PKA is a serine/threonine kinase that can be stimulated by extracellular signals that elevate intracellular cAMP concentrations. cAMP binds to the regulatory subunit of the enzyme, which leads to dissociation of regulatory and catalytic subunits. The catalytic subunit phosphorylates the substrate at its specific phosphorylation sites. The substrate may either be the effector protein or another protein that mediates the effect. Increased cAMP concentrations can be obtained experimentally with the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin (11Seamon K.B. Padgett W. Daly J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3363-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar) and with the selective cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE IV) inhibitor Ro-20–1724 (12Beavo J.A. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1998; 22: 1-38Google Scholar). Recently, we have demonstrated that PKA is involved in the regulation of I Kr in guinea pig cardiac myocytes and HERG channels expressed heterologously in Xenopus oocytes (13Kiehn J. Karle C. Thomas D. Yao X. Brachmann J. Kübler W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25285-25291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Incubation of the cells with the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) leads to a HERG current reduction due to a shift in the activation curve that is mediated mainly by PKA. To investigate the biochemical pathways of this regulation process in more detail, we generated single mutations of all four PKA-specific phosphorylation sites in HERG, combined all of them, and expressed the resulting channel proteins in Xenopus oocytes. Because all enzymes involved in the PKA cascade are present endogenously inXenopus oocytes, we could use indirect protein kinase A activators and inhibitors to study the role of PKA in HERG channel regulation. Our findings show that direct phosphorylation of the channel protein by PKA is involved in the regulation of HERG channel activation, and the PKA-mediated part of the shift in the HERG activation curve can be abolished by mutating all PKA-specific phosphorylation sites in the HERG channel protein. Voltage clamp measurements of Xenopus oocytes were performed in a low K+ solution containing (in mm) 5 KCl, 100 NaCl, 1.5 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3). Current and voltage electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl solution. Forskolin (Calbiochem) and Ro-20–1724 (Calbiochem) were dissolved in Me2SO to a stock solution of 100 mm and stored at −20 °C. Phorbol-12,13-didecanoate (Calbiochem) was dissolved in Me2SO to a stock solution of 10 mm and stored at −20 °C. On the day of experiments, aliquots of the stock solution were diluted to the desired concentration with the bath solution. All measurements were carried out at room temperature (20 °C). The two-microelectrode voltage-clamp configuration was used to record currents fromXenopus laevis oocytes. Microelectrodes had tip resistances ranging from 1 to 5 megaohms. Data were low-pass filtered at 1–2 kHz (−3 dB, four-pole Bessel filter) before digitalization at 5–10 kHz. Recordings were performed using a commercially available amplifier (Warner OC-725A, Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) and Pclamp software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) for data acquisition and analysis. No leak subtraction was done during the experiments. The recording chamber was continually perfused. Activation curves were fitted with a Boltzmann distribution: G(V) =G max/(1 − exp[(V 1/2 − V)/k]), where V is the test pulse potential,V 1/2 is the half-maximal activation potential, and k is the slope of the activation curve. Statistical data are expressed as mean ± S.D. (n = number of experiments performed). We used paired and unpaired Student'st test to compare the statistical significance of the results: p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. The HERG wild type (HERG WT) clone (3Sanguinetti M.C. Changan J. Curran M.E. Keating M.T. Cell. 1995; 81: 1-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2118) Google Scholar) was a gift from M. T. Keating (GenBankTMaccession number hs04270), which contains the HERG potassium channel coding region downstream the SP6 polymerase promotor. By use of computer analysis with the program HUSAR PROSITE, we searched for consensus PKA phosphorylation sites with the amino acid sequence Arg-Lys-(2)-Xaa-Ser-Thr, where (2Warmke J.E. Ganetzky B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3438-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar) means Arg-Arg and Lys-Lys are also allowed. The program identified four sites. The serine or threonine residues of the PKA phosphorylation sites (Ser-283, Ser-890, Thr-895, Ser-1137) were replaced with the nonphosphorylatable alanine to eliminate PKA-mediated phosphorylation at this position. This resulted in the mutated channels HERG S283A, HERG S890A, HERG T895A, HERG S1137A) The mutations were generated with polymerase chain reaction by mutagenesis on the double-stranded plasmid using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The polymerase chain reaction products between unique anchor sites were sequenced (MWG-Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany), and fragments between these unique restriction sites were cut out using the following combinations of restriction enzymes: BstEII (1137) andNcoI (668) for HERG S283A; FseI (2779) andXhoI (2107) for HERG S890A and HERG T895A; BamHI (3532) and FseI (2779) for HERG S1137A. The mutated fragments were subcloned into the original HERG plasmid and sequenced again. The HERG 4m clone (combination of all four mutations) was generated by introducing mutation S890A into the T895A clone as described above, generating HERG S890A,T895A. Then the restriction fragments containing mutations S283A and S1137A were subcloned into HERG S890A,T895A. Finally, cDNA of HERG 4m was verified by DNA sequencing. Complementary RNA was prepared from the corresponding cDNA (HERG WT, HERG S283A, HERG S890A, HERG T895A, HERG S1137A, HERG 4m) in the pSP64 transcription vector (Promega, Madison, WI) with the mMESSAGE mMACHINE in vitrotranscription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) by use of SP6 polymerase after linearization with EcoRI (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Injection of RNA (50–500 ng/μl) into stage V and VI defolliculated oocytes was performed by using a Nanoject automatic injector (Drummond, Broomall, PA). The volume of injected cRNA solution was 46 nl/oocyte, and measurements were made 2–10 days after injection. We performed site-directed mutagenesis of HERG to generate mutated channels that lack consensus PKA phosphorylation sites (HERG S283A, HERG S890A, HERG T895A, HERG S1137A; and in combination HERG 4m, see Fig.1) and expressed these mutant channels inXenopus oocytes. All clones generated in this study resulted in functional potassium channels with current kinetics similar to those of HERG WT. To investigate the effects of the PDE IV inhibitor Ro-20–1724 (IC50 = 2.2 μm) on HERG potassium channels, we measured currents using a two-step protocol (see Fig.2 A). A variable first step (test pulse) was applied at different potentials from −80 mV to +80 mV (increment 10 mV) for 0.4 s and a second step at −120 mV to measure inward tail currents. The holding potential was −80 mV in all experiments performed in this study. The tail current amplitude depends on the preceding test pulse and is a measure of channel activation. The normalized tail current amplitude was inverted and displayed as a function of the preceding test pulse potential, which results in the activation curve. In the control currents, the voltage for half-maximal activation V 1/2 was −4.3 mV (Fig. 2,A and C). When 100 μm Ro-20–1724 was applied into the bath for 30 min (Fig. 2 B), the activation curve was shifted by 14.0 mV to 9.7 mV (Fig. 2 C). The average shift in five experiments was 12.4 ± 3.2 mV. This was statistically significant. We used an additional protocol that evokes outward tail currents as shown in Fig. 2 D. The variable test pulse from −80 to 80 mV (increment 10 mV) for 0.4 s was followed by a constant return pulse to −60 mV (0.4 s). The control HERG current had an activation threshold of −40 mV, then the current amplitude reached a maximum at 0 mV and decreased at test pulse potentials from 20 to 70 mV because of inward rectification that is characteristic to this channel (3Sanguinetti M.C. Changan J. Curran M.E. Keating M.T. Cell. 1995; 81: 1-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2118) Google Scholar, 5Kiehn J. Lacerda A.E. Wible B. Brown A.M.

Typical current traces are shown in Fig.2 D (control measurements) and Fig. 2 E (after application of 100 μm Ro-20–1724 into the bath for 30 min). The maximum outward current amplitude during the test pulse was reduced significantly by 19.1 ± 12.8% (n = 5). Fig. 2 F displays the current amplitude during the test pulse as a function of the test pulse potential (control measurement and after incubation with 100 μm Ro-20–1724 for 30 min). We mutated all four consensus PKA phosphorylation sites in the HERG channel protein (HERG 4m). The current kinetics of the HERG 4mclone was almost identical to the wild type HERG channel current kinetics (compare Figs. 3, Aand D with Fig. 2, A and D), but the half-maximal activation voltage obtained during control measurements was shifted toward more negative potentials (Fig. 3 C). The average V 1/2 of HERG 4m during control experiments was −16.4 ± 1.6 mV (n = 6) (HERG wild type gave −4.7 ± 1.5 mV (n = 3)). In contrast to HERG WT, addition of 100 μm Ro-20–1724 caused virtually no change of current properties in HERG 4mafter 30 min of perfusion (Fig. 3, D and E).V 1/2 was only shifted by 3.8 ± 1.7 mV to −12.6 ± 2.4 mV (n = 6) (Fig. 3 C and Fig. 6 A), and there was no significant current reduction ((ΔI = +2.8 ± 8.1% (n = 6) (Fig. 3 F)). Thus, direct phosphorylation of HERG WT channels at its PKA phosphorylation sites is responsible for the activation shift induced by PKA.Figure 6A, activation curves of HERG WT and HERG 4m during control measurements and after incubation with 100 μm Ro-20–1724 for 30 min in a typical experiment. Inhibition of the phosphodiesterase IV by Ro-20–1724 causes a shift of the activation curve in HERG WT channels by 14.0 mV, whereas in HERG 4m channels there was no significant shift (3.7 mV). Note that the baseline activation curve is more negative in HERG 4m than in HERG WT channels.

Forskolin is an adenylate cyclase activator (EC50 = 4.0 μm) that increases intracellular cAMP levels and subsequently stimulates PKA. After having obtained the control measurements (Fig.4, A and D), forskolin (400 μm) was perfused into the bath for 60 min. The resulting current traces are shown in Fig. 4, B andE. Apparently, the activation curve was shifted, and the maximum outward current during test pulses was reduced. In four experiments V 1/2 was shifted significantly by 14.1 ± 4.2 mV from 1.6 ± 2.0 mV to 15.7 ± 4.9 mV. Currents were reduced by 39.9 ± 13.3% (n = 4). Given the elevation of cAMP levels inside the oocyte by forskolin, this demonstrates indirectly that PKA is a key enzyme for the described activation shift. To address the question whether direct phosphorylation of the channel protein is involved in the cascade of activation shift induced by forskolin, we incubated HERG 4m with 0.4 mm forskolin. 60 min after having recorded control current traces (Fig.5, A and D), we found only a small shift in the activation curve of 4.3 ± 1.6 mV from −16.6 ± 0.4 mV to −12.3 ± 2.1 mV (n= 3, Fig. 5 C). This shift was significantly different from the effect of forskolin on HERG wild type channels. Currents during test pulses were also reduced but to a smaller extent (−22.3 ± 26.2% (n = 3), Fig. 5, D-F), compared with HERG wild type (−39.9%). Thus the presence of functional phosphorylation sites regulates the PKA-mediated activation shift in HERG channels by forskolin. Based on the results described above, it is likely that PKA-mediated phosphorylation is involved in HERG activation. This hypothesis is further strengthened by the observation that the baseline midpoint of the activation curve of HERG 4m was −14.8 ± 2.2 mV (n = 9), whereas the HERG WT baseline midpoint was −4.7 ± 1.5 mV (n = 3, Fig.6). This difference of −10.1 mV was statistically significant. The difference in the activation curves becomes even greater when we compare the activation curves values under stimulation of PKA with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor Ro-20–1724. Under this condition, the HERG 4m has a half-maximal activation voltage of −12.6 ± 2.4 mV (n = 6), whereas HERG wild type has 9.7 ± 3.2 mV (n = 5). This results in a difference of 22.3 mV between HERG 4m and HERG wild type (Fig. 6 A). Some of the clones carrying single mutations showed a tendency toward more negative potentials as well (T895A, S283A, and especially S890A) (Fig. 6 B). The values were V 1/2= −5.9 ± 2.4 mV for T895A (n = 9), V 1/2= −6.0 ± 3.0 mV for S283A (n = 6), V 1/2= −8.0 ± 4.8 mV for S890A (n = 6), andV 1/2= −2.6 ± 1.9 mV for S1137A (n = 7). This study demonstrates that HERG potassium channel activation is regulated by direct phosphorylation of the HERG protein. This has been shown by mutating all four consensus PKA phosphorylation sites in the HERG protein (resulting in the HERG 4mchannel) and analyzing the electrophysiological effects of PKA stimulation by adding Ro-20–1724, an inhibitor of the PDE IV, or adding the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin. Our results demonstrated that the HERG wild type activation curve was shifted and the repolarizing HERG current amplitude was reduced by protein kinase A, whereas in the HERG 4m channel these effects were virtually absent. Because all PKA sites are mutated in the HERG 4m channel, we conclude that PKA produces these electrophysiological effects by direct phosphorylation of the channel protein. Regulation of HERG channels by PKA has been found recently in another expression system as well. Palma et al. (15Palma E., Yu, Z. Fishman G.I. McDonald T.V. Circulation. 1998; 98 (Suppl. I): 57Google Scholar) could demonstrate that stimulation of PKA reduces HERG currents in HERG-transfected cultural cells. In isolated guinea pig cardiomyocytes, the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current,I Kr, that is produced by the HERG potassium channel was decreased by stimulating protein kinases, presumably PKA (13Kiehn J. Karle C. Thomas D. Yao X. Brachmann J. Kübler W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25285-25291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Therefore regulation of HERG channels by PKA may be of physiological relevance. The baseline midpoint of the activation curve was −4.7 mV for HERG WT and −14.8 mV for HERG 4m (Fig. 6 A). This difference in the baseline activation curves indicates that the positions of the mutations and its phosphorylation by PKA are crucial for activation. Even more so, because the difference in activation after stimulation of PKA was higher (22mV) (Fig. 6 A). There are two possible explanations for the difference in the baseline half-maximal activation voltage between HERG WT and HERG 4mchannels. Either mutating the serines or threonines to alanines causes this effect, but more likely the naturally occurring higher phosphorylation occupancy of HERG WT compared with HERG 4minduces this baseline shift. All four mutations contribute to the baseline shift, because single mutations shift the activation curve to a smaller extent compared with HERG 4m (Fig.6 B). In a previous study (13Kiehn J. Karle C. Thomas D. Yao X. Brachmann J. Kübler W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25285-25291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that the phorbol ester PMA produces a stronger PKA-dependent shift in the activation kinetics of HERG channels (37 mV) compared with the shift by Ro-20–1724 (14.0 mV) or forskolin (14.1 mV). PMA is a very potent but not specific compound. It is known to be an activator of protein kinase C and other protein kinases including PKA, and many of its effects are not fully understood. There is clear evidence that direct activation of protein kinase C is not involved in shifting the activation curve of HERG channels, because the very similar phorbol ester, phorbol-12,13-didecanoate, known to activate PKC (16Darbon J.M. Valette A. Bayard F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1986; 35: 2683-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), does not produce any shift (data not shown). Furthermore, experiments with the direct and very specific PKC activator 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonyl-glycerol support these results as well, because they produced no shift (13Kiehn J. Karle C. Thomas D. Yao X. Brachmann J. Kübler W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25285-25291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In this study, we exclusively investigated PKA-specific effects particularly with PKA pathway-specific compounds, such as forskolin or Ro-20–1724. Nevertheless there are possibly other factors as well mediating the PMA-induced shift that cannot be determined at this point. Some clinical conditions might reflect the physiological significance of our findings. Under β-adrenergic stimulation (17Sun Z.H. Swan H. Viitasalo M. Toivonen L. J. Am. Coll.

Cardiol. 1988; 20: 91-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the cAMP level in cardiac cells is elevated. At the same time these conditions are associated with a high incidence of cardiac arrhythmias. Also, patients with congenital long QT syndrome typically develop “torsade de pointes” arrhythmias under emotional or physical stress when cAMP levels are elevated (25Priori S.G. Napolitano C. Paganini V. Cantu F. Schwartz P.J. PACE. 1997; 20: 2052-2057Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 26Zhou J.T. Zheng L.R. Liu W.Y. PACE. 1992; 15: 2164-2168Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Finally arrhythmias are a common side effect during the therapeutical use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors (27Naccarelli G.V. Goldstein R.A. Am. J. Cardiol. 1989; 63: 35A-40AAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) in situations like chronic heart failure (28Packer M. Am. J. Cardiol. 1989; 63: 41A-45AAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) or cardiogenic shock. Our results demonstrate a link between the cAMP-PKA-system and the repolarizing HERG potassium current. The PKA-induced phosphorylation of HERG and changes in repolarization described in this study may be a crucial link in arrhythmogenesis. Thus, this regulatory process may be a pharmacological target for future therapeutic approaches in antiarrhythmic therapy. We thank Dr. M. T. Keating for providing the HERG clone, and we gratefully acknowledge the technical support of K. Güth, S. Kadel, and S. Lück."

The 45-kDa variant of the PTP TCPTP (TC45) exits the nucleus upon EGF receptor activation and recognizes the EGF receptor as a cellular substrate. We report that TC45 inhibits the EGF-dependent activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but does not alter the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2. These data demonstrate that TC45 can regulate selectively mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways emanating from the EGF receptor. In EGF receptor-mediated signaling, the protein kinase PKB/Akt and the mitogen-activated protein kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2, function downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). We have found that TC45 and the TC45-D182A mutant, which is capable of forming stable complexes with TC45 substrates, inhibit almost completely the EGF-dependent activation of PI 3-kinase and PKB/Akt. TC45 and TC45-D182A act upstream of PI 3-kinase, most likely by inhibiting the recruitment of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase by the EGF receptor. Recent studies have indicated that the EGF receptor can be activated in the absence of EGF following integrin ligation. We find that the integrin-mediated activation of PKB/Akt in COS1 cells is abrogated by the specific EGF receptor protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor tyrphostin AG1478, and that TC45 and TC45-D182A can inhibit activation of PKB/Akt following the attachment of COS1 cells to fibronectin. Thus, TC45 may serve as a negative regulator of growth factor or integrin-induced, EGF receptor-mediated PI 3-kinase signaling.

They are found in eukaryotes, prokaryotes and viruses and can either antagonize or potentiate protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK)-dependent signaling. PTPs have been shown to participate as either positive or negative regulators of signal transduction in a wide range of physiological processes, which include cellular growth and proliferation, migration, differentiation and survival (1Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 365-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 2Tonks N.K. Adv.

Despite their important roles in such fundamental physiological processes, the mechanism by which PTPs exert their effects is often poorly understood. The human T-Cell PTP (TCPTP) is an intracellular non-transmembrane phosphatase that was originally cloned from a T-cell cDNA library but is now known to be expressed in many tissues. TCPTP contains a conserved catalytic domain and a non-catalytic C-terminal segment that varies in size and function as a result of alternative splicing. Two splice variants differing only in their extreme C termini are expressed. The 48-kDa form of human TCPTP (TC48) contains a 34-residue hydrophobic tail, which is replaced by a hydrophilic 6-residue sequence in the 45-kDa form (TC45). TC48 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (4Cool D.E. Tonks N.K. Charbonneau H. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7280-7284Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 5Lorenzen J.A. Dadabay C.Y. E. H. F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), whereas under basal conditions TC45 is localized in the nucleus due to the presence of a bipartite nuclear localization sequence (5Lorenzen J.A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 21548-21557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). All PTPs contain an aspartic acid that is essential for catalysis. Mutation of this residue, Asp-182 in TCPTP, to alanine reduces the catalytic activity but maintains a high affinity for substrates, thereby generating a “substrate trapping” mutant, which can form stable complexes with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in vitro (10Garton A.J. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and in vivo (11Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Using the TCPTP D182A substrate trapping mutants, we have shown previously that TCPTP displays a restricted specificity in a cellular context, and that the EGF receptor is one of its substrates (12Tiganis T. Bennett A.M. Ravichandran K.S. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1622-1634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both TC48 and TC45 recognize the tyrosine-phosphorylated EGF receptor as a substrate in a cellular context; TC48 recognizes the receptor as it proceeds through the ER and may function to prevent inappropriate signaling by the nascent receptor during synthesis, whereas TC45 can exit the nucleus in response to EGF and gain access to signaling complexes containing the EGF receptor at the plasma membrane (12Tiganis T. Bennett A.M. Ravichandran K.S. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1622-1634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we have examined the effect of overexpression of TC45 on EGF receptor-induced signaling events. We show that TC45 can inhibit the EGF-induced activation of PKB/Akt and that this correlates with a reduced association of PI 3-kinase with the activated EGF receptor. In addition, we show that plating of COS1 cells on fibronectin leads to activation of PKB/Akt, in an EGF-independent but EGF receptor and PI 3-kinase-dependent manner, which is also inhibited by TC45. Thus, TC45 may serve as a negative regulator of specific signals from the EGF receptor that mediate PKB/Akt activation.

COS1 cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Where indicated, COS1 cells were serum-starved for 24 h in DMEM containing 0.1% FBS, plus antibiotics. COS1 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (12Tiganis T. Bennett A.M. Ravichandran K.S. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1622-1634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated cells were transfected using TCPTP pMT2 plasmid DNA at 20 μg/10-cm dish. Cells were washed three times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 5–6 h after transfection and supplemented with fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS. Where indicated approximately 1–2 × 106COS1 cells were electroporated in 250 μl of medium with 20 μg of TCPTP pMT2 plasmid at 200 V and 950 microfarads in 0.4-cm cuvettes and seeded into a 10-cm dish. Transfected or electroporated cells were collected at 36–48 h after transfection, or washed once with PBS at 24 h after transfection, supplemented with DMEM containing 0.1% FBS and processed at 48 h after transfection. The efficiency of electroporation, as assessed by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactosidase staining of pCMV-β-galactosidase-electroporated COS1 cells, was routinely 50–75%. COS1 cells, in 10-cm dishes, were transfected with 2 μg of HA-tagged ERK2 pJ3H plasmid or 5 μg of FLAG-tagged JNK pCMV plasmid and either 15 μg of pMT2 plasmid or 15 μg of the TC45 or TC45-D182A pMT2 plasmids. At 24 h after transfection, cells were washed once with PBS and serum-starved overnight for 24 h. Cells were then left unstimulated or stimulated with 100 ng/ml EGF for 15 min and processed for either ERK2 kinase assays as described previously (12Tiganis T. Bennett A.M. Ravichandran K.S. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1622-1634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or JNK assays. For JNK assays, cells were lysed in 0.9 ml of immunoprecipitation (IP) lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% w/v Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm vanadate, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm benzamidine, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), centrifuged (12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) and FLAG-tagged JNK immunoprecipitated from the supernatant with 5 μg of anti-FLAG M2 antibody for 90 min at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected on protein G-Sepharose for 30 min at 4 °C and JNK kinase activity measured using GST-Jun (GST fused to the N terminus of c-Jun) as substrate as described previously (13Joneson T. McDonough M. Bar-Sagi D. Van Aelst L. Science. 1996; 274: 1374-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Anti-FLAG immune complexes from these reactions were resolved by SDS-PAGE, immunoblotted with anti-FLAG antibodies, and quantitated by densitometry in order to normalize for FLAG-JNK activity. COS1 cells were electroporated with either pMT2 vector control, TC45 or TC45-D182A plasmids as indicated above. At 24 h after electroporation, cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then stimulated with EGF (100 ng/ml) for 15 min. Cells were lysed in 0.9 ml of IP lysis buffer, and lysates were precleared with 0.1 ml of Pansorbin (Cambridge, MA) for 60 min at 4 °C. Precleared lysates were subsequently centrifuged (12,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C), and the phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C under constant mixing, using a mixture of the anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies G98 and G104 (20 μl of G98 and 20 μl of G104 ascites for every 10-cm dish of cells) (10Garton A.J. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 12Tiganis T. Bennett A.M. Ravichandran K.S. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1622-1634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immune complexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) for 60 min at 4 °C, washed four times with IP lysis buffer; two times with 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, buffer containing 100 mmNaCl and 1 mm EDTA; and three times with PI 3-kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA). PI 3-kinase assays were performed in 100 μl of PI 3-kinase buffer containing 100 μm ATP (plus 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) and 50 μg of sonicated crude brain lipids (containing approximately 10% phosphatidylinositol) (14Shaw L.M. Rabinovitz I. Wang H.H. Toker A. Mercurio A.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 949-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar) for 20 min at room temperature. Reactions were stopped with 100 μl of 1m HCl, and the phospholipids were extracted and separated by thin layer chromatography on silica plates coated with potassium oxalate. [32P]Phosphatidylinositol was quantitated on a PhosphorImager using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). COS1 cells, in 10-cm dishes, were transfected with 5 μg of HA-tagged PKB/Akt pECE plasmid, with or without 5 μg of p110K227E pSG5 plasmid, and either 15 μg of the pMT2 plasmid or 15 μg of the TC45 or TC45-D182A pMT2 plasmids. At 24 h after transfection, cells were serum-starved and either left unstimulated or stimulated with EGF (100 ng/ml) for 15 min. Cells were then lysed in 0.9 ml of IP lysis buffer, the lysates centrifuged (12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) and HA-PKB/Akt immunoprecipitated from the supernatant with anti-HA antibody 12CA5 (2 μl of ascites/10-cm dish of cells) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose CL-4B for 60 min at 4 °C, washed three times with IP lysis buffer, and washed two times with PKB/Akt kinase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). PKB/Akt kinase activity was assayed using the peptide substrate RPRAATF-NH2 (15Alessi D.R. Caudwell F.B. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) by incubating the immunoprecipitated HA-PKB/Akt for 10 or 20 min at 30 °C in 30 μl of PKB/Akt kinase buffer containing 50 μm ATP (plus 0.25 μm[γ-32P]ATP) and 50 μm peptide substrate. The reaction was terminated by adding 15 μl of 0.5 m EDTA and after brief centrifugation 20 μl of the supernatant was spotted onto P-81 phosphocellulose paper. Unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP was eliminated by three 5-min washes in 75 mm orthophosphoric acid and phosphorylated peptide bound to the paper counted. Anti-HA immune complexes from the kinase reactions were resolved by SDS-PAGE, immunoblotted with anti-HA antibodies, and quantitated by densitometry in order to normalize for HA-PKB/Akt activity. Transfections for PKB/Akt assays were conducted either in duplicate or triplicate. COS1 cells were electroporated with pMT2 vector control, TC45, or TC45-D182A expression plasmids as indicated above. At 24 h after electroporation, cells were serum-starved for 24 h, washed in PBS, and then harvested by limited trypsin-EDTA treatment (1 ml of 0.025% trypsin plus 5 mm EDTA in DMEM minus phenol red/10-cm dish of cells). After trypsin inhibition by soybean trypsin inhibitor (1 mg of chromatographically purified type I-S trypsin inhibitor (Sigma)/10-cm dish of cells) in DMEM minus phenol red containing 0.25% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) (radioimmunoassay grade, fraction V from Sigma), the cells were pelleted by centrifugation and washed twice with DMEM minus phenol red containing 0.25% (w/v) BSA and resuspended in DMEM minus phenol red containing 0.1% (w/v) BSA. The cells were held in suspension at 37 °C for 30 min prior to attachment for 1 h onto tissue culture dishes precoated with fibronectin (5 ml of 10 μg/ml human plasma fibronectin/10-cm dish incubated overnight at 4 °C and then washed once with DMEM minus phenol red and warmed to 37 °C for 30 min). Attached cells were rinsed twice in DMEM minus phenol red containing 0.1% (w/v) BSA, once in ice-cold PBS, and then collected in hot 3× Laemmli sample buffer containing 6% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as indicated. In response to stimulation with EGF, the TC45-D182A substrate trapping mutant forms a stable complex with the EGF receptor (12Tiganis T. Bennett A.M. Ravichandran K.S. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1622-1634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At early time points after EGF stimulation, the TC45-D182A mutant accumulates at the cell periphery and colocalizes with the EGF receptor (Fig.1), consistent with recognition of the tyrosine-phosphorylated EGF receptor at the plasma membrane. To examine the role of TC45 in EGF receptor signaling, we have overexpressed wild type TC45 and the TC45-D182A mutant in COS1 cells and measured their effects on EGF-dependent activation of the MAPKs, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (Fig. 2). Consistent with our previous studies, we observed no apparent effect of TC45 on the activation of HA-tagged ERK2 (12Tiganis T. Bennett A.M. Ravichandran K.S. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1622-1634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, coexpression of TC45 inhibited the activation of FLAG-tagged JNK by 38.3 ± 7.8%. These results illustrate the ability of TC45 to regulate selectively signaling events emanating from the EGF receptor. Recent studies have indicated that EGF-induced activation of JNK, but not ERK2, is mediated by PI 3-kinase (16Logan S.K. Falasca M. Hu P. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5784-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 17King W.G. Mattaliano M.D. Chan T.O. Tsichlis P.N. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4406-4418Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Consistent with these studies, we found that the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin had no effect on EGF-induced activation of ERK2 (Fig. 2, panel A,inset), but inhibited the activation of JNK by 57.1 ± 9.4% (Fig. 2, panel B). These results suggest that PI 3-kinase may be a target by which TC45 mediates its effects on the activation of JNK.Figure 2Selective effects of TC45 on MAPK signaling pathways: TC45 inhibits the EGF-induced activation of JNK but not ERK2. A, COS1 cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing HA-tagged ERK2 and pMT2 vector control, TC45, or TC45-D182A (TC45D). Transfected cells were serum-starved and either left unstimulated or stimulated with EGF (100 ng/ml) for 15 min. Cells were then lysed, and HA-tagged ERK2 was precipitated and assayed using myelin basic protein as a substrate as described previously (12Tiganis T. Bennett A.M. Ravichandran K.S. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1622-1634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Values shown are arbitrary units and are means ± standard errors of three independent experiments involving duplicate transfections.Inset, COS1 cells were serum-starved, left untreated, or treated with 100 nm wortmannin (Wort) for 60 min and then stimulated with EGF (100 ng/ml) for 15 min. Cell lysates were probed with an anti-ERK2 antibody. B, COS1 cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing FLAG-tagged JNK and either vector control, TC45, or TC45-D182A (TC45D). At 24 h after transfection cells were serum-starved in DMEM containing 0.1% FBS for 24 h, left untreated or treated with 100 nmwortmannin for 60 min, and then either left unstimulated or stimulated with EGF (100 ng/ml) for 15 min. Cells were then lysed and FLAG-tagged JNK was immunoprecipitated and assayed using GST-Jun. Anti-FLAG immune complexes from these reactions were resolved by SDS-PAGE, immunoblotted with anti-FLAG antibodies, and quantitated by densitometry in order to normalize for FLAG-JNK expression. Values shown are arbitrary units and are means ± standard errors of three independent experiments with duplicate transfections.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although the mechanism by which PI 3-kinase regulates the activation of JNK is not known, the ability of PI 3-kinase to regulate the activation of the protein kinase PKB/Akt, which mediates the effects of PI 3-kinase on cell proliferation and survival, is well documented (18Franke T.F.

The lipid product of PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate, binds to the pleckstrin homology domain of PKB/Akt and recruits it to the plasma membrane, where it is further activated by phosphorylation of Thr-308 and Ser-473. To determine whether TC45 regulates PI 3-kinase-mediated signaling processes, we examined the effects of TC45 and TC45-D182A on the EGF-induced stimulation of PKB/Akt, by coexpressing HA-tagged PKB/Akt with either TC45 or TC45-D182A in COS1 cells. The activity of HA-immunoprecipitated PKB/Akt was measured in vitro using the specific peptide substrate RPRAATF (15Alessi D.R. Caudwell F.B. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Both wild the type TC45 and the TC45-D182A mutant inhibited the EGF-induced activation of PKB/Akt by approximately 60–70% (Fig.3). Importantly, under similar conditions, expression of the ER-localized spliced variant TC48 had no apparent effect (Fig. 3, panel B). These results demonstrate that simple overexpression of a PTP is not sufficient to inhibit PKB/Akt activation and underscores the importance of proper subcellular localization for the control of TCPTP action. As PKB/Akt is not tyrosine-phosphorylated it cannot serve as a substrate of TC45. Consequently, it is likely that TC45 exerts its effects on PKB/Akt, and possibly JNK, at a step upstream in the signaling pathway by regulating negatively the EGF-induced activation of PI-3 kinase. PI 3-kinase is activated by associating with sites of tyrosine phosphorylation generated by activated receptor tyrosine kinases (25Backer J.M. Myers Jr., M.G. Shoelson S.E. Chin D.J. Sun X.J.

Biol. 1992; 12: 981-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Therefore, PI 3-kinase activity can be measured in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates to determine the extent by which it is stimulated in response to EGF (29Hu P. Margolis B. Skolnik E.Y. Lammers R. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 981-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). To examine the effects of TC45 on PI 3-kinase activity, we electroporated COS1 cells with expression plasmids for either vector control, TC45, or TC45-D182A and measured PI 3-kinase activity in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates. Under these conditions TC45 and TC45-D182A inhibited the EGF-induced PI 3-kinase activity by ∼50% (Fig. 4,panel A). Furthermore, we observed that the phosphorylation of PKB/Akt on serine 473 was inhibited by a similar extent, as measured in lysates of these electroporated cells (Fig. 4,panel B). Since the electroporation efficiency in these experiments was also in the order of 50–75% (data not shown), these results suggest that overexpression of TC45 can inhibit almost completely the activation of PI 3-kinase and PKB/Akt. These results are consistent with the ∼70% inhibition of the EGF-induced activity of HA-tagged PKB/Akt (Fig. 3). To examine whether TC45 can inhibit the activation PKB/Akt independently of its effects on PI 3-kinase, we cotransfected COS1 cells with expression plasmids encoding HA-tagged PKB/Akt and a constitutively active form of the PI 3-kinase catalytic subunit, p110K227E (30Kauffmann-Zeh A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Ulrich E. Gilbert C. Coffer P. Downward J. Evan G. Nature. 1997; 385: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar), together with either vector control, TC45 or TC45-D182A and measured the effects on HA-PKB/Akt activity. Expression of TC45 and TC45-D182A did not inhibit the p110K227E-induced activation of PKB/Akt either in the absence or presence of EGF (Fig.5). Therefore, these data illustrate that TC45 must act to suppress the activation of PI 3-kinase, thereby inhibiting the downstream activation of PKB/Akt. These observations raise the issue of how TC45 suppresses the activation of PI 3-kinase. One possibility is that TC45 acts on the EGF receptor, to inhibit the recruitment of the PI 3-kinase p85 regulatory subunit, thereby preventing PI 3-kinase activation and the subsequent activation of PKB/Akt. Whereas the wild type TC45 has the capacity to dephosphorylate the EGF receptor, the TC45-D182A substrate trapping mutant would bind to phosphotyrosine sites on the EGF receptor, thus competing with SH2 domain-containing signaling molecules and thereby interfering with concomitant PI 3-kinase activation. We investigated whether expression of TC45 could inhibit the recruitment of the p85 PI 3-kinase subunit to the EGF receptor (Fig. 6). First, we examined the ability of TC45 to reduce the amount of p85 in anti-phosphotyrosine antibody immunoprecipitates from EGF-stimulated COS1 cells that had been electroporated with vector control, TC45 or TC45-D182A expression plasmids. Following EGF stimulation of control cells, the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase could be detected in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates. However, tyrosine-phosphorylated p85 was not detectable is cell lysates or p85 immunoprecipitates from EGF-stimulated cells (data not shown), suggesting that the p85 in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates was associated with other phosphotyrosine-containing proteins. We found that wild type and mutant TC45 significantly decreased the amount of p85 in the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody immunoprecipitates (Fig. 6,panel A) and the extent of this inhibition was similar to the observed decrease in PI 3-kinase activity in anti-phosphotyrosine antibody immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4,panel A). Since one of the major phosphotyrosine-containing protein in anti-phosphotyrosine antibody immunoprecipitates from EGF stimulated COS1 cells is the EGF receptor (12Tiganis T. Bennett A.M.

Although ORL1 shares high sequence similarities with opioid receptors, it does not bind opioid ligands with high affinity. Opiate drugs, the prototype of which is morphine, are largely used in medicine for the treatment of pain, but their administration is associated with severe side effects, including high abuse potential (see Ref. 5Schug S.A.

At present our comprehension of thein vivo functions of the ORL1 receptor is severely limited by the lack of ligands, agonists as well as antagonists, with high selectivity and bioavailability. Combinatorial strategies are important new approaches to drug discovery, and synthetic peptide combinatorial libraries (SPCL) have repeatedly shown their usefulness as a source of new drug leads; in particular, when SPCL have been applied to the search for new ligands of the opioid receptors, potent hexapeptides (13Dooley C.T.

Houghten R.A. Biotechniques. 1992; 13: 901-905PubMed Google Scholar)) was screened with the μ-, δ- and κ-opioid receptors, and potent, selective ligands were found for each of the three receptors. Peptides, however, generally display unfavorable pharmacological properties, like poor bioavailability, short duration of action, and lack of oral activity (17Farmer P.S. Ariens E.J. Drug Design. Academic Press, Inc., New York1980: 119-143Crossref Google Scholar), prompting the effort to evolve them into peptidomimetics (18Hruby V.J. Al-Obeidi F. Kazmierski W. Biochem.

Sci. 1994; 2: 253-258Google Scholar) has divided the peptide-to-peptidomimetic transition into three logical steps: (a) identification of the amino acid side chains responsible for activity (“pharmacophoric groups”); (b) establishment of the spatial relationship between these groups (“pharmacophore model”); (c) selection of an organic template suitable for reproducing the geometry of the pharmacophore model. The most difficult and usually rate-limiting step is the second one, since only rarely can the biologically relevant peptide topology be deduced from direct observation of the receptor-ligand complex. Although, as noted above, SPCL are very effective to carry out stepa, their use in steps b and c is still in its infancy (21Nikolaiev V. Stierandova A. Krchnak V. Seligmann B. Lam K.S. Salmon S.E.

Purification of individual peptides and separation of diastereoisomers was carried out by reversed phase HPLC on a Nucleosyl C-18, 250 × 21-mm, 100-Å, 7-mm column using H2O, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as eluents. Analytical HPLC was performed on a Ultrasphere C-18, 250 × 4.6-mm, 80-Å, 5-mm column (Beckman). Purified (≥95%) peptides were characterized by mass spectrometry and amino acid analysis. All cell lines were from ATCC and maintained in the presence of 5% fetal calf serum and 5% CO2. COS-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Eurobio, Les Ulis, France), and CHO cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's-F-12 medium (Eurobio). CHO stably transfected with pCDNA3/Neo (Invitrogene, Nu Leek, Netherlands) or hORL1 and hKOR were gifts from Lawrence Toll (Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Biology, San Diego, CA) and C. Mollereau (Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale, Toulouse, France), respectively. Cells were electroporated essentially as described (34Befort K. Tabbara L. Kieffer B.L. Neurochem. Res. 1996; 21: 1301-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 107 COS-1 cells were seeded the night before transfection at a density of 107cells/140-mm dish. Cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline and detached by applying trypsin/EDTA (Eurobio). Cells were collected by centrifugation for 10 min at 400 × g and resuspended at a density of 108 cells/ml in EP 1× buffer (50 mm K2HPO4, 20 mmCH3CO3K, 20 mm KOH, pH 7.4). hMOR, hDOR, or hKOR plasmidic DNA, prepared using Nucleobond columns (Macherey Nagel, Düren, Germany) and consisting of variable amounts of receptor-encoding plasmid and a carrier plasmid (pBluescript) up to a final 20-μg DNA quantity was diluted into EP 1× buffer to a total volume of 300 μl. The DNA mix was then supplemented with 13 μl of 1 m MgSO4 and incubated with 200 μl of cell suspension for 20 min at room temperature. The cell/DNA mixture was then transferred to a 0.4-cm cuvette and electroporated using a Gene Pulser apparatus (Bio-Rad) at a capacitance setting of 2000 microfarads and voltage setting of 240 volts. Cells were then immediately transferred into 50 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum and seeded into 2 140-mm dishes. After 72 h of growth, the cells were harvested, and membranes were then prepared as described previously (34Befort K. Tabbara L. Kieffer B.L. Neurochem. Res. 1996; 21: 1301-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Transfected cells (4 140-mm dishes at a 50 to 100% confluency) were washed with 2× phosphate-buffered saline, scrapped off the plates in phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted by centrifugation at 400 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, frozen at −80 °C for 30 min at least, and thawed in 30 ml of cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, when membranes were prepared for ligand binding experiments, and 30 ml of cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 2.5 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (added extemporaneously) was added for [35S]GTPγS binding experiments. All the following steps were performed at 4 °C. The cell lysate was Dounce-homogenized and spun at 400 × gfor 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 15 ml of buffer, Dounce-homogenized, and spun again at 400 × g for 10 min. Both supernatants were pooled and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min. The pellet was then resuspended in 4 ml of 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7, and the protein concentration was measured using the Bradford assay. Membranes were then aliquoted at a 1-mg protein/ml concentration and stored at −80 °C. When membranes were prepared for [35S]GTPγS binding experiments, the pellet was resuspended in 25 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, Dounce-homogenized, and spun again at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was then resuspended in 4 ml of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7, 0.32 m sucrose, and the protein concentration was measured as described above. Binding experiments were done as described previously (35Simonin F. Befort K. Gaveriaux-Ruff C. Matthes H. Nappey V. Lannes B. Micheletti G. Kieffer B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1015-1021PubMed Google Scholar). For saturation experiments, various concentrations (from 5 × 10−11 to 6.4 × 10−9m) of [3H]diprenorphine (hMOR, hDOR, hKOR) or [leucyl-3H]nociceptin (hORL1) were used. For competition experiments, membrane proteins were diluted in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and incubated with [3H]diprenorphine (0.2 nm for hMOR and hDOR and 0.4 nm for hKOR) or 0.1 nm[leucyl-3H]nociceptin (for hORL1), and variable concentrations of competitor peptide (7.8 × 10−11 to 5 × 10−5m) in a total volume of 0.2 ml for 1 h at 25 °C. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm naloxone (hMOR, hDOR, hKOR) or 1 μm nociceptin/orphanin FQ (hORL1). K iand K d values were determined using the EBDA/Ligand program (G. A.

For the opioid receptors, 5 μg of hMOR, hKOR, and hDOR membrane proteins were incubated 1 h at 30 °C in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, GDP (3 μm for hKOR, and 30 μm for hMOR and hDOR), 0.2 nm[35S]GTPγS, and ligands (1.8 × 10−11to 1 × 10−5m for the opioid ligand, and 2.8 × 10−10 to 5 × 10−5m for the competitor peptides) in a final volume of 0.2 ml (34Befort K. Tabbara L. Kieffer B.L. Neurochem. Res. 1996; 21: 1301-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For hORL1, 5 μg of membrane proteins were incubated 1 h at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 40 μm GDP, 0.2 nm[35S]GTPγS, and ligands (1.8 × 10−11to 1 × 10−5m for nociceptin/orphanin FQ, and 2.8 × 10−10 to 5 × 10−5m for the competitor peptides) in a final volume of 0.2 ml. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm GTPγS. Incubation mixtures were rapidly washed using a cell harvester (Brandell, Gaithersburg, MD) with cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl on H2O-presoaked GF/B filters. Bound radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. EC50 values were determined using the Prism software (GraphPad, San Diego, USA). To find new ligands for the opioid and ORL1 receptors, we have screened a reverse-turn peptide SPCL composed of 2 × 107 N-terminal-acetylated and C-terminal-amidated peptides in a so-called positional scanning format (26Wallace A. Altamura S. Toniatti C. Vitelli A. Bianchi E. Delmastro P. Ciliberto G. Pessi A. Peptide Res. 1994; 7: 27-31PubMed Google Scholar). Each peptide of this library is constrained in a β-turn conformation by a rigid turn-forming mimetic block (ATA) in its center (see Fig.1). The library is composed of four sublibraries: Ac-O1X-ATA-XX-NH2, Ac-XO2-ATA-XX-NH2, Ac-XX-ATA-O3X-NH2, Ac-XX-ATA-XO4-NH2 (Ac, acetyl). Each sublibrary is composed of 68 peptide mixtures, in which the position labeled (On) is defined by the amino acids indicated in the legend of Fig. 2. We used an expanded combinatorial set, including many noncoded amino acids, and most of the residues were present both with l and d chirality.Figure 2Screening of the β-turn mimetic SPCL . A, hMOR and hDOR membranes were labeled using a nonselective opioid antagonist [3H]diprenorphine (0.2 nm for hMOR and 0.4 nm for hDOR). B, hKOR and hORL1 membranes were labeled using 0.4 nm [3H]diprenorphine and 0.1 nm [leucyl-3H]nociceptin, respectively. Assays were carried out using target receptor either transiently expressed in COS-1 cells (hMOR, hDOR, hKOR) or stably expressed in CHO cells (hORL1).

The sublibraries were screened at a fixed concentration of 500 μm (1.6 nm for each individual peptide). For hKOR, all the mixtures inhibited >90% of radioligand binding in this initial screening; the library was therefore screened again at a 10-fold lower concentration (50 μm). Results of the screening of the four sublibraries with the four receptors are shown in Fig. 2. A lot of peptide mixtures in each sublibrary were found to be active (>75% inhibition) on either one or several receptors, particularly hKOR and hMOR. We therefore selected the most active and/or selective consensus sequences to synthesize individual peptides. For the first sublibrary (position O1), l-Arg, d-Trp, andl-Cha were the most active residues on the four receptors and were then selected (excepted for hDOR for which we selected onlyl-Cha and d-Trp). More selective residues were also selected for hMOR (homo-l-phenylalanine andl-Arg) and for hKOR (l-Fno). The second sublibrary (position O2) was the most active one on the four receptors, especially on hMOR and hKOR (all the peptide mixtures showed >75% inhibition of the binding).

This clone was identical to human legumain, a cysteine endopeptidase. Legumain significantly inhibited OCL-like multinucleated cell formation induced by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) and parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) in mouse and human bone marrow cultures, and bone resorption in the fetal rat long bone assay in a dose-dependent manner. Legumain was detected in freshly isolated marrow plasma from normal donors and conditioned media from human marrow cultures. Furthermore, treatment of human marrow cultures with an antibody to legumain induced OCL formation to levels that were as high as those induced by 1,25-(OH)2D3. Implantation in nude mice of 293 cells transfected with the legumain cDNA and constitutively expressing high levels of the protein significantly reduced hypercalcemia induced by PTHrP by about 50%, and significantly inhibited the increase in OCL surface and in OCL number expressed per mm2 bone area and per mm bone surface induced by PTHrP. These results suggest that legumain may be a physiologic local regulator of OCL activity that can negatively modulate OCL formation and activity.

Nolan P.D. Nature. 1963; 200: 225-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Osteoclast activity and formation are regulated by both systemic hormones and locally produced factors. We have used an expression cloning approach with a cDNA expression library prepared from highly purified human OCL-like cells formedin vitro to identify local factors that modulate OCL formation. We have recently identified two novel stimulators of OCL formation, annexin II (2Takahashi S. Reddy S.V. Chirgwin J.M. Devlin R. Haipek C. Anderson J. Roodman G.D. J. Biol.

We have screened this library for additional factors that enhance or inhibit OCL formation, and report here the identification and characterization of a previously unknown inhibitor of the OCL, legumain. Legumain inhibited OCL formation in both long term human and murine marrow cultures and blocked 45calcium (45Ca) release from fetal rat long bones stimulated by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3(1,25-(OH)2D3). Interestingly, legumain was detected in normal human marrow plasma, and addition of an antibody to legumain induced high levels of OCL formation in human marrow cultures in the absence of any added stimulator of OCL formation. In addition, legumain was active in vivo and inhibited PTHrP-stimulated OCL bone resorption in nude mice implanted with human kidney fibroblast 293 cells genetically engineered to constitutively express human legumain. DNA transfection kits were obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), and cDNA synthesis kits were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. PCR kits were obtained from Perkin-Elmer. All restriction enzymes used were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) and Life Technologies, Inc., and chemicals were from Sigma. The 23c6 monoclonal antibody was generously provided by Dr. Michael Horton (St. Bartholomew's Hospital, London, United Kingdom). The construction and screening of the human cDNA expression library prepared from OCL-like multinucleated cells formedin vitro were done as described previously (2Takahashi S. Reddy S.V.

Pools, whose conditioned media significantly and reproducibly inhibited tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive multinucleated cell formation in murine marrow cultures and OCL-like cell formation in human bone marrow cultures, were progressively subfractionated until the subpool contained only one cDNA that inhibited OCL-like cell formation in both murine and human systems. The cDNA, initially named “osteoclast inhibitory peptide-2,” was then sequenced by standard techniques, compared with cDNA sequences in the GenBank data base and was found to be identical to human legumain (GenBank accession no. Y09862). The marrow cells (1 × 106 cells/culture) from C57Bl mice were isolated and cultured for OCL-like multinucleated cell formation in the presence or absence of 10−9m1,25-(OH)2D3 and varying concentrations of conditioned media from 293 cells transfected with the legumain cDNA, as described by Takahashi and co-workers (5Takahashi N.

The cultures were then stained for TRAP using an acid phosphatase staining kit (Sigma). The TRAP-positive multinucleated cells containing three or more nuclei were counted with an inverted microscope. In selected experiments, conditioned media from 293 cells transfected with the legumain cDNA were added at various times after the initiation of murine marrow cultures stimulated with 1,25-(OH)2D3 (10−9m) (day 0, 2, 4, or 6 of culture). The cultures were continued for a total of 7 days, and the number of TRAP-positive multinucleated cells determined. In experiments to assess the effects of legumain on OCL apoptosis, conditioned media from 293 cells transfected with the legumain cDNA (5% v/v) were added to murine marrow cultures on day 4 and day 6 or only day 6 of culture. The cultures were continued for 24 h, and the percentage of apoptotic OCL-like cells was determined as described previously (6Hughes D.E. Dai A. Tiffee J.C. Li H.H. Mundy G.R. Boyce B.F. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). In experiments to assess the effects of osteotropic factors on expression of legumain, human bone marrow was cultured with IL-3 (3 ng/ml), stem cell factor (15 ng/ml), and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (200 pg/ml) for 10 days to induce CFU-GM colony formation, and the CFU-GM-derived colonies were isolated with a pipette. One hundred thousand cells/ml were then cultured in α-minimum essential medium with 15% fetal calf serum. Salmon calcitonin (50 ng/ml), 1,25-(OH)2D3(10−9m), hIL-1β (10 ng/ml), or media were then added to the cultures, and the cultures continued for 48 h. At the end of this culture period, the cells were harvested, RNA extracted, and the relative amounts of legumain mRNA and GAPDH mRNA compared by cycle-dependent reverse transcriptase-PCR. RNA was reverse-transcribed using murine Maloney virus reverse transcriptase, and then the PCR reaction was run at 94 °C for 1 min, then 94 °C for 30 s, then 59 °C for 30 s, followed by 72 °C for 1 min for 18–30 cycles. The primers for GAPDH were purchased from CLONTECH(Palo Alto, CA), and the primers for legumain were 5′-CAG TGC GTA AGA TCG TCT CCT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTC TGA TCA GCA CAC AGT CGG-3′ (antisense). Human long term marrow cultures were performed as described previously (6Hughes D.E. Dai A. Tiffee J.C. Li H.H. Mundy G.R. Boyce B.F. Nat.

Collection of bone marrow from normal donors was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX. In brief, human bone marrow nonadherent mononuclear cells from normal volunteers were cultured at 106 cells/ml in α-minimum essential medium, 20% horse serum with or without 10−9m1,25-(OH)2D3, and varying concentrations of legumain conditioned media. Half of the medium was changed weekly. After 3 weeks, the cultures were harvested and stained with the 23c6 monoclonal antibody that identifies the OCL vitronectin receptor, and the 23c6-positive multinucleated cells scored. Multinucleated cells that cross-react with the 23c6 monoclonal antibody express calcitonin receptors and resorb bone (8Kurihara N. Chenu C. Miller M. Civin C. Roodman G.D. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 2733-2741Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Timed pregnant rats were injected with 250 μCi of 45Ca at day 18 of gestation, and 1 day later the rats were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and the embryos removed. The explanted radii and ulnae were cultured on circles of membrane filter (mixed ester, 0.45 μm; Whatman, Hillsboro, OR) on stainless steel grids in 0.5 ml of chemically defined medium (Sigma) supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and penicillin-streptomycin (50 units/ml and 50 mg/ml), in a controlled atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C, as modified by Raisz and Niemann (9Raisz L.G. Niemann I. Endocrinology. 1969; 85: 446-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The radii and ulnae were incubated for 24 h in control medium to allow for the removal of the exchangeable45Ca before transferring to equilibrated control or experimental medium. Bone resorption was stimulated with 10−9m 1,25-(OH)2D3 or 20 ng/ml PTHrP with or without varying concentrations of legumain conditioned media. Control and experimental media were then changed after 72 h, with bone explants incubated for a total of 5 days. Bone-resorbing activity was measured as percentage of total45Ca release from the bone into the media over the 5 days of incubation. The legumain cDNA probe was purified from the plasmid by restriction endonuclease digestion with EcoRI, separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and recovered from the gel using a DEAE membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) according to manufacturer's protocol. Specific activity of greater than 2 × 109 cpm/μg DNA was attained for the probe using a random priming kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). The filter was prehybridized for 3 h and then hybridized for 20 h with 107 cpm/ml aqueous hybridization fluid. The filters were washed with 0.2× SSC and 0.1% SDS, exposed in photographic cassettes, and visualized by autoradiography. Northern blot analysis was done with human multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH), as well as RNA from human bone marrow and MG63 cells. From the pcDNA1 mammalian expression clone, the coding region of the legumain cDNA was generated by PCR amplification with two primers, GCC ATA TGG TTT GGA AAG TAG CTG T and GAG AAT TCT TCT CAG AAT AAA GAC TCC T. The DNA fragment generated by PCR was digested with NdeI (recognition sequence underlined) and BamHI (to cleave the cloning site in the vector) and ligated into the PET 14b vector. Twelve transformants were isolated and confirmed by sequence analysis. TheEscherichia coli recombinant protein was produced and purified on His-Bind resin (Novagen Co., Madison, WI) as described previously (4Choi S.J. Devlin R.D. Menaa C. Chung H. Roodman G.D. Reddy S.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1360-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The recombinant legumain fusion protein was dissolved in 10 mm NaOH. This purified recombinant legumain was used for the generation of a rabbit polyclonal antibody, and for testing in mouse and human bone marrow cultures and fetal rat organ culture assays. The recombinant legumain protein was emulsified in PBS containing complete Freund's adjuvant, and a rabbit was immunized with 200 μg of emulsified protein in a total volume of 0.2 ml. After 14 days, the animal was hyperimmunized by injection of 200 μg/0.2 ml of the recombinant legumain preparation. At least three repeat challenges were performed once every 14 days. The specific reactivity of the legumain antiserum was determined by testing its capacity to detect legumain in Western blots. Crude legumain from anE. coli lysate induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, purified legumain recombinant protein, or concentrated conditioned medium from 293 cells transfected with the legumain cDNA were boiled in SDS sample buffer and loaded onto an 8% PAGE slab gel. To detect the protein profile, the PAGE gel was stained with Coomassie Blue. Electrophoretic transfer of proteins from polyacrylamide to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell) was performed using a semi-dry blotting unit (Fisher) at 20 V for 45 min. After transfer, the nitrocellulose membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk and then blotted with the legumain polyclonal antibody. The nitrocellulose membrane was then washed and reacted with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG and visualized with the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) on the Kodak X-AR5, according to manufacturer's protocol. 293 cells (2 × 106) were stably transfected with the legumain cDNA in the pIRES/neo vector (293-legumain cells) or the empty vector (293 cells) (CLONTECH) and then cultured in media containing 400 μg of G418. Every 4 days, the selection media containing G418 was changed, and after 2 weeks of culture in selection media, single colonies were isolated using cloning rings. Each colony was tested for legumain expression by Western blot analysis. The biological activity of legumain produced by these colonies was determined by treating fetal rat long bone organ cultures with serum-free media lacking G418 that has been conditioned by the cells for 48 h, and determining 45Ca release as described above. Four-week-old nude mice (4 mice/group) were injected in the thigh muscles with 5 × 106 293 cells or 293-legumain cells in 100 μl of PBS 3 weeks before treating the mice with PTHrP. Mice with palpable tumors were injected with 2 μg of PTHrP in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline four times per day subcutaneously for 5 days using a protocol that we have shown previously causes hypercalcemia and increased bone resorption (10Boyce B.F. Yates A.J. Mundy G.R. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 2780-2783Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Blood from the retro-orbital sinus was sampled at base line and 2 h after the second injection each day, and ionized blood calcium levels were measured using a 634 ISE Ca2+ pH analyzer (Ciba-Corning Diagnostics Corp., Medfield, MA). The effects of legumain and PTHrP on bone histomorphometry were assessed in the calvariae, which were removed intact from the mice at the end of the experiment. The fixation and staining procedures were as described by Boyceet al. (11Boyce B.F. Aufdemorte T.B. Garrett I.R. Yates A.J. Mundy G.R. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 1142-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The following variables were measured in two representative sections from each calvaria using a digitizing table and the Bioquant computerized image analysis system (R&M Biometrics, Inc., Nashville, TN) and standard histomorphometric techniques (12Boyce B.F. Yoneda T. Lowe C. Soriano P. Mundy G.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1622-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar): 1) total bone area; 2) the number of OCLs within the bone marrow spaces, expressed per mm2 total bone area and per mm bone/bone marrow interface; and 3) the extent of OCLs along the bone/bone marrow interface, expressed as a percentage of the total interface length. Seven consecutive fields of equal length were counted in each slide. Serum samples from these mice were assayed for the relative amounts of legumain detectable by serially diluting the samples in PBS and performing Western blot analysis as described above. In vitro results are reported as the mean ± S.E. for five replicate samples and were compared by Student's t test. Results were considered significantly different for p < 0.05. The in vivo results were compared using Student's Neuman-Keuls test and are representative of the findings in three to five separate experiments. The cDNA expression library was screened by testing the effects of conditioned media from 293 cells transfected with cDNA from each pool for their capacity to inhibit OCL-like multinucleated cell formation in mouse bone marrow cultures. Conditioned media (1–10%) were added to mouse bone marrow cultures in the presence of 10−9m 1,25-(OH)2D3. The number of TRAP-positive multinucleated cells was counted and compared with the control cultures treated with conditioned media from 293 cells transfected with the empty pcDNA1 vector. A total of five pools that reproducibly inhibited multinucleated cell formation in murine marrow cultures treated with 10−9m1,25-(OH)2D3 were detected from the original 200 pools. The positive pools were then screened by PCR for the presence of transforming growth factor β or γ-interferon mRNA, factors known to inhibit OCL formation. γ-Interferon cDNA was detected in one of the pools (data not shown), which was not screened further. The remaining four positive cDNA pools were separated into 12 subpools each, containing 100–200 clones/pool. The cDNAs from the individual pools were transfected into 293 cells, and the conditioned media tested for their effects on TRAP-positive multinucleated cell formation in mouse bone marrow cultures. One of the positive subpools containing 200 clones was fractionated into two 96-well plates, with one clone per well. Conditioned medium from each row and column pool of these matrices was tested for its capacity to inhibit multinucleated cell formation in mouse marrow cultures. The inhibitory cDNA was approximately 1.9 kilobase pairs in length. The cDNA sequence of the clone was determined, and it encoded a 1299-base pair open reading frame and had poly(A) adenylation signal and a poly(A) tail. Comparison of the coding sequence to sequences in the GenBank data base revealed that it was identical to the recently reported human legumain (human asparaginyl endopeptidase) (13Chen J.M. Dando P.M. Rawlings N.D. Brown M.A. Young N.E. Stevens R.A. Hewitt E. Watt C. Barrett A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8090-8098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 14Chen J.M. Dando P.M. Stevens R.A. Fortunato M. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The cDNA sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence also had about 30% amino acid and 50% DNA sequence homology with plant legumain (asparaginyl endopeptidase) (15Takeda O. Miura Y. Mitta M. Matsushita H. Kato I. Abe Y. Yokosawa H. Ishii S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1994; 116: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and blood fluke hemoglobinase. The deduced amino acid sequence of legumain suggested that it was a protein that contained a 17-amino acid N-terminal cleavable signal peptide. Human legumain also had four possible glycosylation sites and one RGD sequence. Legumain mRNA was expressed in all tissues, and very low levels were detectable in brain compared with the other tissues, similar to results reported by Chenet al. (13Chen J.M. Dando P.M.

Significant expression levels of legumain mRNA were also present in bone marrow, but MG63 osteosarcoma cells did not express legumain (data not shown). Immunocytochemical analysis using our polyclonal antibody to legumain of cells in human marrow cultures confirmed that OCL-like multinucleated cells and mononuclear cells expressed legumain (data not shown). We then tested the effects of conditioned media from 293 cells transfected with the legumain cDNA on OCL-like multinucleated cell formation in mouse and human bone marrow cultures. In the mouse bone marrow cultures, legumain conditioned medium inhibited TRAP-positive multinucleated cell formation in the presence of 1,25-(OH)2D3 in a dose-dependent fashion at concentrations from 1% to 10% (v/v) (Fig.1 A) and maximally decreased TRAP-positive multinucleated cell formation approximately 60% at a concentration of 10% (v/v). Addition of legumain conditioned media for only the first 2 days of culture did not significantly inhibit TRAP-positive multinucleated cell formation in the cultures. Addition of legumain between days 2 and 6 of cultures markedly inhibited multinucleated cell formation (Fig. 1 B). The level of inhibition of OCL formation when legumain was added during the second phase of the cultures was similar to that when legumain was present for the entire culture period. Legumain conditioned media also decreased 23c6-positive multinucleated cell formation in human marrow cultures induced by 10−9m1,25-(OH)2D3 approximately 80% at a concentration of 5% (v/v) compared with the control cultures (Fig.1 A). Legumain conditioned media also inhibited multinucleated cell formation in murine and human marrow cultures treated with PTHrP (data not shown). However, although legumain conditioned media inhibited OCL formation (Fig. 1 B), it did not significantly increase the percentage of apoptotic OCLs in these cultures (control: 13 ± 1% versus legumain-treated: 8.6 ± 0.6%) when legumain was added for the last 48 h of the cultures. 45Ca-labeled fetal rat long bones were stimulated with 10−9m1,25-(OH)2D3 and treated with varying concentrations of legumain conditioned media. Legumain inhibited45Ca release about 70% at 32% (v/v) compared with conditioned media from 293 cells transfected with the empty pcDNA1 vector (Fig. 2 A). Legumain conditioned media also inhibited PTHrP-stimulated bone resorption in a dose-dependent manner and inhibited 45Ca release by about 70% at a concentration of 32% (v/v) compared with conditioned media from 293 cells transfected with the empty pcDNA1 vector (Fig. 2 B). Treatment of highly purified human OCL precursors (CFU-GM-derived cells) with 1,25-(OH)2D3 or IL-1β, factors that stimulate OCL formation, decreased the relative levels of legumain mRNA compared with control cultures. Comparison of the relative amounts of legumain mRNA to that of GAPDH (a housekeeping gene used to control for mRNA loading) demonstrated that the ratio of legumain mRNA to GAPDH mRNA for IL-1- and 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated cultures was 0.4 or 1.04, respectively, compared with 3.05 and 4.0 for control or calcitonin-treated cultures (Fig. 3). Recombinant legumain was expressed in E. coli BL 21 by induction with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside using the PET14b system. The cell pellet was solubilized with 6m GnHCl and purified with a His-Bind resin column as described above. Recombinant legumain was eluted with a 50–80 mm imidazole gradient in 6 m GnHCl and precipitated by double-distilled H2O dialysis. After re-chromatography in the presence of 6 m GnHCl on the His-Bind column, about 1 mg of recombinant legumain was obtained from 1 liter of E. coli culture with more than 95% purity. Legumain cDNA was transfected into 293 cells, and the conditioned media were harvested and concentrated on an Amicon 10-kDa membrane. The concentrated fraction was analyzed by PAGE and immunoblotted with the anti-legumain polyclonal antibody. A slightly larger 50-kDa band was detected in 293 cell conditioned media transfected with legumain cDNA compared with the control E. coli-derived recombinant protein (20 ng), which ran as a 46-kDa band (Fig.4 A), most likely because it was not glycosylated. In contrast, no band was detected in concentrated media from 293 cells transfected with the empty vector. Analysis of freshly isolated normal human bone marrow plasma that was assayed immediately after collection and conditioned media from human bone marrow cultures showed two bands, one at 50 kDa and a second at 30 kDa. Compared with control recombinant legumain (Fig. 4 B), human bone marrow plasma had at least 50 ng/ml legumain. Since bone marrow cultures contain large amounts of legumain, we determined if the legumain secreted by these cells was inhibiting OCL formation in these cultures. In human bone marrow cultures, addition of preimmune sera did not increase 23c6-positive multinucleated cell formation above control levels. In contrast, addition of the polyclonal antibody against legumain increased 23c6-positive multinucleated cell formation 4-fold at a dilution of 1:2500 (Fig. 5 A). To confirm that the anti-legumain was neutralizing the effects of legumain in human marrow cultures, we tested the capacity of the anti-legumain to block the inhibitory effects of recombinant legumain in murine marrow cultures treated with PTHrP. Addition of the legumain antiserum (1:2000) to murine marrow cultures treated with recombinant legumain (5 ng/ml) blocked the inhibitory effects of legumain (Fig. 5 B). The legumain antiserum did not block the effects of PTHrP in murine marrow cultures (multinucleated cells/culture: PTHrP-treated = 33 ± 8.5 (mean ± S.E.) versus PTHrP + anti-legumain = 21.5 ± 1.7; p = 0.233). Conditioned media from 293 cell lines stably transfected with legumain were examined for expression of legumain by Western blot and for biological activity in fetal rat long bone culture. Stable clones 3–1 and 3–3 expressed high levels of legumain (approximately 50–100 ng/ml per 4 × 105 cells plated for 48 h)in vitro. These conditioned media blocked bone resorption consistently in fetal rat organ cultures (data not shown). The 3–1 clone was used for the in vivo experiments described below because it produced the highest levels of legumain (approximately 100 ng/ml in vitro). In nude mice bearing 293-legumain cells, hypercalcemic effects of PTHrP were attenuated compared with mice bearing control 293 cells. As shown in Fig. 6, administration of PTHrP for 5 days in these animals significantly increased whole blood ionized calcium to >1.4 mmol/liter. In contrast, whole blood ionized calcium levels were significantly reduced in mice bearing 293-legumain producing tumors and treated with PTHrP compared with mice bearing 293 control tumors and treated with PTHrP (Fig. 6). Whole blood ionized calcium levels did not differ significantly among mice injected with 293-legumain cells or control 293 cells and treated with vehicle, but were significantly less than those seen in animals receiving PTHrP. Histomorphometric analysis of calvarial sections from animals from these experiments showed that mice injected with 293-legumain cells and treated with PTHrP had significantly fewer OCLs and OCL surfaces and smaller bone marrow spaces than animals bearing control 293 tumors treated with PTHrP (Fig. 7, aand b). OCL numbers and OCL surfaces in the 293-legumain animals treated with PTHrP were nonetheless higher than those in control animals bearing 293 tumors, but not treated with PTHrP. Animals bearing legumain-producing tumors and treated with vehicle had similar numbers of OCLs and bone-resorbing surfaces as mice bearing control tumors. Gross dissection of animals bearing 293-legumain producing tumors and 293 cell tumors reveals that there were no differences detected in any organ system except in bone. Western blot analysis of serum samples from mice bearing control or legumain producing 293 cells confirmed that increased levels of legumain were present in sera from mice bearing 293-legumain tumors compared with controls (Fig.7 c).Figure 7Effects of legumain on bone resorption in calvaria of mice treated for 5 days with PTHrP , as described under “Experimental Procedures.” a, increased numbers of osteoclasts (arrow) are seen resorbing bone along the bone/bone marrow interface in mice treated with PTHrP. Mice bearing legumain producing 293 cell tumors (B) treated with PTHrP had lower numbers of osteoclasts and decreased marrow spaces compared with the mice bearing control 293 cell tumors treated with PTHrP (A). Few osteoclasts were observed in the control mice bearing 293 cells with (C) or without legumain (D), and bone marrow spaces were smaller than those seen in the PTHrP-treated mice. b, Histomorphometric analysis of the effects of legumain on osteoclast activity induced by PTHrP in vivo. Osteoclast number per mm2 bone area and per mm bone/bone marrow interface, and osteoclast surface percentage were significantly reduced in mice bearing legumain producing tumors and treated with PTHrP (p < 0.0001) compared with the control mice treated with PTHrP. However, no difference was observed between vehicle (PBS)-treated mice bearing control or legumain producing tumors. c, Western blot analysis of sera from mice bearing 293-legumain tumors and control 293 cell tumors. Sera were serially diluted and then subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-legumain as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have cloned and characterized a previously unknown inhibitor of OCL activity, legumain, which inhibits OCL formation in both murine and human cultures in vitro and PTH-stimulated bone resorptionin vivo. Legumain is a member of the mammalian cysteine protease family, the asparaginyl endopeptidases, which have been identified recently (13Chen J.M. Dando P.M. Rawlings N.D. Brown M.A. Young N.E. Stevens R.A. Hewitt E. Watt C. Barrett A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8090-8098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 14Chen J.M. Dando P.M. Stevens R.A. Fortunato M. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Legumain is present in significant amounts in normal human marrow and in human marrow cultures, and neutralization of legumain in human marrow cultures, in the absence of any added stimulator of OCL formation, induced OCL formation to levels similar to those induced by 1,25-(OH)2D3, one of the most potent inducers of OCL formation in vitro. Treatment of mice bearing legumain-producing tumors with PTHrP decreased the effects of PTHrP on bone remodeling. These data suggest that legumain may act as a physiologic regulator of OCL activity and serve to limit the number of OCLs normally present in bone. OCLs are relatively rare cells on normal bone surfaces (0.3/mm2) (16Mundy G.R. Roodman G.D. Peck W.A. Bone and Mineral Research. Elsevier Science Publishers, New York1987: 209-281Google Scholar). Large numbers of OCLs would be undesirable in normal bone, leading to osteopenia. The significant amounts of legumain present in normal bone may explain why exposure of mice to exogenous legumain did not decrease basal OCL activity. However, our in vitro andin vivo data demonstrate that stimulators of OCL formation can overcome the inhibitory effects of legumain and increase the numbers of OCLs formed on the bone surface in response to appropriate stimuli, suggesting that legumain is a negative modulator of OCL activity. Legumain appears to block the later stages of OCL formation. Legumain inhibited OCL formation from mononuclear precursors in murine cultures only when it was added in the second half of the culture period, suggesting that it was inhibiting the differentiation/fusion phase of osteoclastogenesis, rather than the proliferative phase. Biskobing and co-workers (17Biskobing D.M. Fan X. Rubin J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 10: 1025-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) have previously shown that osteoclastogenesis occurs in discrete stages in murine marrow cultures. Days 1 through 3 of murine marrow cultures is the phase in which the OCL precursor pool proliferates, and days 4 through 8 is the stage when the cells differentiate to post-mitotic cells and then fuse to form OCLs. Legumain also had no effect on OCL apoptosis. Interestingly, two factors that stimulate OCL formation (IL-1 or 1,25-(OH)2D3) decreased the relative levels of legumain mRNA in human OCL precursors. In contrast, calcitonin, an inhibitor of OCL formation, did not have a significant effect on levels of legumain mRNA. The data suggest that the mechanism of action of legumain is similar to that of another recently described inhibitor of the OCL, osteoprotegerin, a member of the tumor necrosis factor α receptor family (18Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. Kelley M. Chang M.S. Luthy R. Nguyen H.Q. Wooden S. Bennett L. Boone T. Shimomoto G. De Rose M. Elliott R. Colombero A. Tan H.-L. Trail G. Sullivan J. Davy E. Buray N. Renshaw-Gegg L. Hughes T.M. Hill D. Pattison W. Cambell P. Sander S. Van G. Tarpley J. Derby P. Lee R. Boyle W.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 309-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4261) Google Scholar) that also inhibits the differentiation/fusion stage of OCL formation. However, legumain is structurally unrelated to osteoprotegerin and has different effects in vivo (19Hofbauer L.C. Dunstan C.R. Spelsberg T.C. Riggs B.L. Khosla S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 776-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The observations that factors that stimulate OCL formation down-regulate legumain expression while inhibitors of OCL formation do not, also suggest that legumain may be an important regulator of OCL formation. These results further suggest that stimulators of OCL formation may in part increase OCL formation by decreasing production of legumain. The molecular mechanism responsible for legumain's inhibition of OCL formation is unknown. A similar activity has been detected inSchistosoma mansoni and acts as a hemoglobinase to degrade host hemoglobin (20Brindley P.J. Kalinna B.H. Dalton J.P. Day S.R. Wong J.Y. Smythe M.L. McManus D.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 89: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 21Goldberg D.E. Slater A.F.G. Beavis R. Chait B. Cerami A. Henderson G.B. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 961-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Legumain has an active site highly specific for substrates with asparaginyl bonds and cleaves only some of the asparaginyl bonds in polypeptides (22Kembhavi A.A. Buttle D.J. Knight C.G. Barret A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 303: 208-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, it is unknown if this enzyme activity plays a role in the inhibitory effects of legumain on OCL formation/activity. It is unlikely that legumain inhibits OCL formation by cleaving PTHrP, since it also inhibits 1,25-(OH)2D3-stimulated OCL formation in murine and human cultures as well as OCL formation stimulated by RANK ligand, a recently described osteoclast differentiation factor (19Hofbauer L.C. Dunstan C.R. Spelsberg T.C. Riggs B.L. Khosla S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 776-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Alternatively, legumain also contains an RGD sequence that could participate in the inhibitory activity of legumain. RGD-containing peptides can inhibit OCL bone resorption (23Fisher J.E. Caulfield M.P. Sato M. Quartuccio H.A. Gould R.J. Garsky V.M. Rodan G.A. Rosenblatt M. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1411-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Further studies are currently under way to address the potential physiologic role of legumain in bone remodeling and its potential role in pathologic states of bone remodeling."

The CaM-binding domain is located immediately following the 7th transmembrane segment. We also show that the CaM-binding domain of mGluR7 is phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC). This phosphorylation is inhibited by the binding of Ca2+/CaM to the receptor. Conversely, the Ca2+/CaM binding is prevented by PKC phosphorylation.

Group 1 receptors (mGluR1 and mGluR5) are coupled to the stimulation of the inositol trisphosphate (IP3)/Ca2+ signaling pathway. Group 2 (mGluR2 and mGluR3) and group 3 (mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7, and mGluR8) receptors are coupled to the inhibitory cyclic AMP cascade in heterologously expressing cells but differ in their agonist selectivity. Among the mGluR family, mGluR7 is the most highly conserved across different mammalian species (5Makoff A. Pilling C. Harrington K. Emson P. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 40: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and is widely distributed throughout the central nervous system (6Kinzie J.M. Saugstad J.A. Westbrook G.L. Segerson T.P.

This receptor is selectively activated by l-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate (l-AP4) (10Okamoto N. Hori S. Akazawa C. Hayashi Y. Shigemoto R. Mizuno N. Nakanishi S. J. Biol.

At synapses, mGluR7 is located in close proximity to synaptic vesicle release sites (9Kinoshita A. Shigemoto R. Ohishi H. van der Putten H. Mizuno N. J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 393: 332-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 14Shigemoto R. Kulik A. Roberts J.D.B. Ohishi H. Nusser Z. Kaneko T. Somogyi P.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7503-7522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent gene targeting analysis has indicated that mGluR7 deficiency causes a reduction in high frequency synaptic transmission, post-tetanic potentiation, and short term potentiation in the CA1 synapses of hippocampal slices (16Bushell T.J. Sansig G. Shigemoto R. Flor P. Kuhn R. Knoepfel T. Schroeder M. Collett V.L. Collingridge G.L. van der Putten H. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: A6Crossref Google Scholar). In behavioral analyses, these knockout mice showed a deficit in fear response and conditioned taste aversion (17Masugi M. Yokoi M. Shigemoto R. Muguruma K. Watanabe Y. Sansig G. van der Putten H. Nakanishi S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 955-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, mGluR7 has been postulated to play an important role in synaptic modulation and plasticity. However, it remains elusive whether a variety of cellular and physiological functions of mGluR7 all result from coupling to the inhibitory cyclic AMP cascade mediated by this receptor subtype. Recent biochemical and molecular studies have indicated that protein-protein interactions play a pivotal role in regulation and signal transduction of group 1 mGluRs (18Brakeman P.R. Lanahan A.A.

The identification of molecules that interact with receptors would thus provide an important clue for understanding the receptor function. In this study, we attempted to identify proteins that interact with mGluR7 by glutathioneS-transferase (GST) affinity chromatography using the intracellular carboxyl terminus of mGluR7 (ct-mGluR7). We show that a 17-kDa protein, which was identified as calmodulin (CaM), binds directly to ct-mGluR7 in a Ca2+-dependent manner. In addition, we show that the Ca2+/CaM binding is inhibited by protein kinase C (PKC)-evoked phosphorylation. Furthermore, PKC phosphorylation of ct-mGluR7 is inhibited by Ca2+/CaM binding. Materials were purchased from the following sources: bovine CaM from Sigma; mouse monoclonal antibody against CaM (anti-CaM mAb) from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY); rat brain PKC from Calbiochem; catalytic subunit of bovine heart protein kinase A (PKA) from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; [γ-32P]ATP from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. ct-mGluR2 (Gln820-Leu872), ct-mGluR3 (Gln829-Leu879), ct-mGluR4 (His848-Ile912), ct-mGluR6 (His840-Lys871),and ct-mGluR7 (His851-Ile915) were amplified, using the corresponding mGluR cDNAs (10Okamoto N.

Chem. 1993; 268: 11868-11873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as templates by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). ct-mGluR8 (His844-Ile908) was amplified with rat brain total RNA by reverse transcriptase-mediated PCR (23Saugstad J.A. Kinzie J.M. Shinohara M.M. Segerson T.P. Westbrook G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Primers for PCR or reverse transcriptase-mediated PCR were designed as follows: the nucleotide sequence immediately following the 7th transmembrane segment and covering 19–21 base pairs of the downstream sequence of each individual ct-mGluR was preceded by an appropriate restriction cleavage site and used as a 5′ primer. The sequence containing a stop codon and the upstream sequence of each respective ct-mGluR was followed by a restriction cleavage site and used as a 3′ primer. GST fusion proteins containing different ct-mGluRs (GST-ct-mGluRs) were generated by inserting the PCR products in-frame into a multiple cloning site downstream of the GST-coding region of the pGEX4T series of vectors (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Truncated forms of ct-mGluR7 fused to the GST protein were similarly constructed by starting with an appropriate amino-terminal sequence in ct-mGluR7 and ending with the TAA stop codon. All ct or truncated forms of mGluR7 were designed to contain the common linker amino acid sequence between GST and the inserts. A proper in-frame insertion and the absence of any sequence errors of the PCR products were confirmed by DNA sequencing in both strands of all constructs. The GST fusion proteins were expressed in anEscherichia coli strain BL21 and purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The GST-ct-mGluR7 protein was further purified by cation exchange chromatography on a MonoS column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a gradient elution from 150 to 405 mm NaCl in a solution containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 2 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Fractions containing the GST-ct-mGluR7 protein were combined, dialyzed against 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, and then concentrated with Ultrafree (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Brains from adult Sprague-Dawley rats were homogenized on ice using a glass-Teflon homogenizer (20 strokes) in Buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was precleared by passing through Sepharose 4B beads. GST fusion proteins (100 μg) were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (50 μl) and incubated with the precleared brain supernatant for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with Buffer A five times, and bound proteins were eluted by adding the sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) loading buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (4–20%) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The concentration of proteins was measured using the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Amino acid sequences were determined essentially according to the method of Matsudaira (24Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The blotted membrane was briefly stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. After extensive washing with water, membrane pieces containing the proteins of interest were excised and then examined with a Procise 492 gas-phase sequencer (Applied Biosystems Division, Perkin Elmer). GST or GST fusion proteins (2 μg each) were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (20 μl). CaM (1 μg) was incubated with GST or GST fusion protein-immobilized beads in 500 μl of Buffer B (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100) in the presence of either 2 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EGTA without addition of CaCl2 for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with the incubation buffer, and bound proteins were eluted by the SDS-PAGE loading buffer and incubated for 30 min at 60 °C. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (15% gel) and bound CaM was visualized by immunoblotting with anti-CaM mAb. Chemiluminescence of bound CaM was quantitated by densitometric analysis using The Discovery Series (pdi, Huntington Station, NY). An affinity of CaM for binding to GST fusion proteins was determined by immobilizing a fixed amount of a GST fusion protein (60 pmol) on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads, followed by incubation with increasing concentrations of CaM. Bound CaM was immunoblotted after SDS-PAGE, and amounts of the bound CaM were calculated from the standard curve with known amounts of CaM run on the same gel. Densities of immunoblotted CaM showed a linear relationship with known amounts of CaM, and each data point was obtained within the linear range of the standard curve. Saturation curves were made by fitting the data using the single site relationship B =B max × (F/K d)/(1 + F/K d), where B is the amount bound, F is the amount free, K d is the dissociation constant, and B max represents the maximal number of binding sites. Fitting and calculation ofK d were done by using the Origin software (Microcal Software, Northampton, MA). GST fusion proteins (60 pmol) were incubated with none or increasing amounts of CaM for 2 h at 4 °C. For phosphorylation of PKC or PKA, the incubation mixture (10 μl) contained 8.75 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 52.5 mm NaCl, and 1 mm CaCl2. Phosphorylation was started by addition of the following solution (10 μl): for PKC phosphorylation, 40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 200 μg/mll-α-phosphatidyl-l-serine, 40 μg/ml 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol, 200 μm[γ-32P]ATP (50 mCi/mmol), and 9.6 milliunits of PKC; for PKA phosphorylation, 100 mm MES, pH 6.9, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 400 μm[γ-32P]ATP (50 mCi/mmol), and 10 microunits of catalytic subunit of PKA. Reactions were carried out at 30 °C for the times indicated and stopped by boiling in the SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The phosphorylated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (15% gel), fixed, dried, and finally exposed to an x-ray film. To determine effects of PKC phosphorylation on CaM binding, each of the fusion proteins (2 μg) was phosphorylated for 3 h at 30 °C as described above except that [γ-32P]ATP was replaced with non-labeled ATP. As a control, ATP was depleted in the phosphorylation reaction. We attempted to identify proteins that interact with mGluR7 by affinity chromatography using the ct region of mGluR7 fused to GST. GST alone or GST-ct-mGluR2 was used as control. Rat brain cytosolic fractions were prepared and loaded to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads coated with each GST protein. After extensive washing, bound proteins were eluted by addition of the SDS-PAGE loading buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. A prominent band with a mobility of approximately 17 kDa was detected in the eluate from GST-ct-mGluR7 affinity beads (Fig. 1,lane 2). No such 17-kDa protein was retained with affinity beads attached with (lane 3) or without (lane 4) GST. The specificity of interaction toward ct-mGluR7 was confirmed by using GST-ct-mGluR2 which showed no detectable binding of the 17-kDa protein (lane 1). Peptide sequencing of this 17-kDa protein and subsequent data base analysis indicated that the partial sequence determined (Thr-Ile-Asp-Phe-Pro-Glu-Phe-Leu-Thr-Met-Met-Ala-Arg-Lys-Met-Lys-Asp) precisely corresponded to the sequence of rat CaM. Next, we examined the specificity of interaction between CaM and the ct regions of group 2 and group 3 mGluRs using GST fusion protein affinity chromatography. The GST proteins fused to the ct regions of group 2 and group 3 mGluRs were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and tested for their ability to retain bovine CaM (Fig.2, upper). CaM interacted exclusively with ct-mGluR7. In contrast, no detectable interaction was observed with group 2 ct-mGluRs and other members of group 3 ct-mGluRs as well as GST alone. Furthermore, the interaction between CaM and ct-mGluR7 was completely abolished by replacing 2 mmCaCl2 with 5 mm EGTA in the binding solution. Staining of the SDS-polyacrylamide gel with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 confirmed that comparable amounts of GST or GST fusion proteins were present in these experiments (Fig. 2, lower). The results indicate that among group 2 and group 3 mGluR subtypes, CaM interacts specifically with ct-mGluR7 in a Ca2+-dependent manner. To define a CaM-interacting domain in ct-mGluR7, we constructed a series of GST fusion proteins possessing different truncation forms of ct-mGluR7 (Fig. 3 A). The truncated forms containing at least residues Val856-Leu892 (Tr1-mGluR7 and Tr4-mGluR7) showed a strong Ca2+-dependent interaction with CaM comparable to that of ct-mGluR7 (Fig. 3 B, upper). The presence and absence of Cys893, which is implicated as a possible palmitoylation site (25Alaluf S. Mulvihill E.R. McIlhinney R.A.J. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1548-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), had no effect on Ca2+/CaM binding. In contrast, removal of a cluster of basic residues at the amino-terminal region of ct-mGluR7 drastically reduced Ca2+/CaM binding (Tr2-mGluR7 and Tr3-mGluR7). In these experiments, comparable amounts of GST fusion proteins were confirmed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining (Fig. 3 B, lower). The affinity of Ca2+-dependent CaM binding to ct-mGluR7 and Tr4-mGluR7 was determined by incubating a fixed amount of the GST fusion proteins immobilized onto glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads with increasing concentrations of CaM in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2 (Fig. 4,A and B). Analysis of saturation curves of bound CaM showed virtually identical values of dissociation constant (K d) of CaM binding for ct-mGluR7 and Tr4-mGluR7, 38.9 ± 8.3 nm for ct-mGluR7 and 45.5 ± 13.6 nm for Tr4-mGluR7 (mean ± S.D., n = 2). The results indicate that the segment consisting of Val856-Leu892 is sufficient for interaction between CaM and ct-mGluR7. The CaM-binding domain in ct-mGluR7 contains consensus sequences for both PKC phosphorylation, (Ser/Thr)-X-(Arg/Lys), and PKA phosphorylation, (Arg/Lys)-(Arg/Lys)-X-(Ser/Thr) (26Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We examined whether ct-mGluR7 serves as a phosphorylation substrate for PKC or PKA and, if so, whether phosphorylation of these kinases and CaM binding are mutually affected by each other. We first examined the effects of CaM binding on PKC phosphorylation by incubating a fixed amount of either GST-ct-mGluR7 or GST-Tr4-mGluR7 with PKC and [γ-32P]ATP in the absence and presence of increasing concentrations of CaM. Time courses and extents of phosphorylation of ct-mGluR7 or Tr4-mGluR7 were determined by autoradiography of a 32P-labeled product run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 5). In the absence of CaM, both ct-mGluR7 and Tr4-mGluR7 were rapidly phosphorylated in a time-dependent manner with about one-third of the proteins estimated to be phosphorylated at 1 h in both cases. Neither GST nor CaM was phosphorylated by PKC. Furthermore, there was no obvious difference in the time course and extent of PKC phosphorylation between ct-mGluR7 (Fig. 5 A) and Tr4-mGluR7 (Fig. 5 B). We also examined possible PKA phosphorylation of GST-ct-mGluR7 by incubating with PKA and [γ-32P]ATP. Regardless of the presence and absence of Ca2+/CaM, GST-ct-mGluR7 was not appreciably phosphorylated by PKA (data not shown). These results show that the CaM-binding domain is a major site of PKC phosphorylation within the ct-mGluR7 sequence. In contrast, this site does not serve as a target for PKA phosphorylation. Importantly, phosphorylation of both ct-mGluR7 and Tr4-mGluR7 was progressively inhibited by adding increasing amounts of CaM to the reaction mixture. At the molar ratio of 1:1 between the PKC substrates and CaM, phosphorylation of both ct-mGluR7 and Tr4-mGluR7 was almost completely inhibited by Ca2+/CaM. Furthermore, no obvious difference in the sensitivity of inhibition of PKC phosphorylation by Ca2+/CaM binding was observed between the two PKC substrates. This finding is consistent with the results above, which show a similar affinity of these mGluR7 segments for Ca2+/CaM binding. The results indicate that the interaction of Ca2+/CaM with the ct domain of mGluR7 prevents phosphorylation by PKC. Finally, we examined the effect of PKC phosphorylation on Ca2+/CaM binding to ct-mGluR7 (Fig.6). GST-ct-mGluR7 or GST-Tr4-mGluR7 was incubated with PKC in the presence and absence of ATP. The resultant GST fusion proteins were coupled to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and tested for their ability to bind to CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Non-phosphorylated GST fusion proteins could bind to Ca2+/CaM, but once phosphorylated, they lost their ability to bind to Ca2+/CaM. The results indicate that Ca2+/CaM binding is inhibited by PKC phosphorylation. In this study, in vitro analysis indicates that CaM directly binds to ct-mGluR7 in a Ca2+-dependent fashion. Among the mGluR family, mGluR5 has been shown to interact with Ca2+/CaM at two distinct sites of ct-mGluR5 with different affinities (27Minakami R. Jinnai N. Sugiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20291-20298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Consistent with the sequence homology between mGluR1 and mGluR5, we have found that Ca2+/CaM also binds to ct-mGluR1. 2K. Ishikawa, Y. Nakajima, and S. Nakanishi, unpublished observations. Interestingly, the group 3 mGluR subtypes (mGluR4, mGluR7, and mGluR8) have highly homologous ct tails, but no significant interaction was observed between CaM and mGluR4 or mGluR8. Therefore, the binding of Ca2+/CaM is specific to group 1 mGluRs and mGluR7 within the mGluR family and thus is not relevant to intracellular second messengers involving these receptor subtypes. The CaM-binding domain of ct-mGluR7 diverges from those of group 1 mGluRs but possesses several structural characteristics of CaM binding (28James P. Vorherr T. Carafoli E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 38-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) as follows: 1) one face possessing basic and polar residues in an α-helical wheel representation, whereas the other face contains a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids; 2) a cluster of basic amino acids at the amino-terminal portion, followed by a sequence that contains relatively few basic amino acids but often possesses a consensus sequence for phosphorylation (Fig. 3). Interestingly, some of these features are shared by mGluR4 and mGluR8. However, these two subtypes show no appreciable interaction with Ca2+/CaM. Therefore, amino acid differences in the middle of the CaM-binding sequence of mGluR7 as compared with mGluR4 and mGluR8 (Fig. 3) seem to be critical for their ability to bind to Ca2+/CaM. The CaM-binding domain of mGluR7 has been located within a segment immediately downstream of the 7th transmembrane segment and upstream of Cys893 in ct-mGluR7. This cysteine residue is commonly present in the ct of group 3 mGluRs (mGluR4, mGluR7, and mGluR8) (Fig.3) and has been reported to be a putative palmitoylation site, for example in mGluR4 (25Alaluf S. Mulvihill E.R. McIlhinney R.A.J. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1548-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Such palmitoylation is thought to be involved in the formation of the 4th intracellular loop structure. For mGluR5, one of the two CaM-binding domains resides at the corresponding portion immediately following the 7th transmembrane segment (27Minakami R. Jinnai N. Sugiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20291-20298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This domain of mGluRs, together with their 2nd cytoplasmic loop, has been shown to serve as a G protein-interacting domain (29Pin J.-P. Joly C. Heinemann S.F. Bockaert J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 30Gomeza J. Joly C. Kuhn R. Knöpfel T. Bockaert J. Pin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2199-2205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Therefore, the overlap of a CaM-binding domain and the G protein-interacting domain suggests an interesting possibility that CaM binding to specific mGluR subtypes may also affect a G protein coupling efficacy. In this study, using in vitro analysis we have demonstrated that ct-mGluR7 is phosphorylated by PKC but not by PKA. Furthermore, CaM binding and PKC phosphorylation are mutually exclusive. There are several precedents that have shown a similar relationship between CaM binding and phosphorylation by PKC. For example, in mGluR5, PKC phosphorylation is inhibited by Ca2+/CaM binding to the receptor, and conversely this binding is prevented by PKC phosphorylation (27Minakami R. Jinnai N. Sugiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20291-20298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In theN-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors, binding of Ca2+/CaM disrupts an interaction between NMDA receptors and the cytoskeletal α-actinin-2 (31Wyszynski M. Lin J. Rao A. Nigh E. Beggs A.H. Craig A.M. Sheng M. Nature. 1997; 385: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 32Zhang S. Ehlers M.D. Bernhardt J.P. Su C.-T. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1998; 21: 443-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Additionally, the CaM binding and protein phosphorylation in NMDA receptors have been reported to be mutually exclusive (33Ehlers M.D. Zhang S. Bernhardt J.P. Huganir R.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 745-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). In both cases, the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) is raised by activation of these receptors, either by the enhancement of Ca2+ influx through a receptor-channel complex or by mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores via IP3 production. These examples therefore differ from the signaling mechanism of mGluR7, which is coupled to the inhibitory cyclic AMP cascade and has no ability to stimulate IP3 formation or influence Ca2+influx directly (10Okamoto N. Hori S. Akazawa C. Hayashi Y. Shigemoto R. Mizuno N. Nakanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1231-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this sense, the reciprocal regulation between CaM binding and PKC phosphorylation of mGluR7 is more reminiscent to the regulation of myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS) by the Ca2+/CaM binding and protein phosphorylation. MARCKS is a major cellular substrate of PKC, with PKC phosphorylation inhibiting CaM binding and CaM binding preventing PKC phosphorylation. The brain MARCKS is highly concentrated at the presynaptic junction and is thought to be phosphorylated by PKC through an increase in [Ca2+]i triggered by neuronal cell stimulation (34Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 71: 713-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). It has recently been reported that activation of PKC suppresses the ability of group 3 mGluRs to inhibit transmission at glutamatergic synapses (13Macek T.A. Schaffhauser H. Conn P.J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6138-6146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, mGluR7 is largely located at the presynaptic terminals. Therefore, it is conceivable that mGluR7 is under dual regulation by PKC and CaM at the presynaptic terminals, when neuronal cells are stimulated and increase a Ca2+ influx through activated Ca2+ channels. Thus, our observations suggest that mGluR7 serves to cross-link the cyclic AMP, Ca2+, and PKC phosphorylation signal transduction cascades. In closing, this process may play an important role in modulating synaptic transmission in concert with the function of CaM which recognizes changes in [Ca2+]i."
https://openalex.org/W2089906148,"Recent evidence suggesting vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C), which is a regulator of lymphatic and vascular endothelial development, raised the question whether this molecule could be involved in Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), a strongly angiogenic and inflammatory tumor often associated with infection by human immunodeficiency virus-1. This disease is characterized by the presence of a core constituted of three main populations of “spindle” cells, having the features of lymphatic/vascular endothelial cells, macrophagic/dendritic cells, and of a mixed macrophage-endothelial phenotype.In this study we evaluated the biological response of KS cells to VEGF-C, using an immortal cell line derived from a KS lesion (KS IMM), which retains most features of the parental tumor and can induce KS-like sarcomas when injected subcutaneously in nude mice. We show that VEGFR-3, the specific receptor for VEGF-C, is expressed by KS IMM cells grown in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, VEGF-C induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-2, a receptor also for VEGF-A, as well as that of VEGFR-3. The activation of these two receptors in KS IMM cells is followed by a dose-responsive mitogenic and motogenic response. The stimulation of KS IMM cells with a mutant VEGF-C unable to bind and activate VEFGR-2 resulted in no proliferative response and in a weak motogenic stimulation, suggesting that VEGFR-2 is essential in transducing a proliferative signal and cooperates with VEGFR-3 in inducing cell migration.Our data add new insights on the pathogenesis of KS, suggesting that the involvement of endothelial growth factors may not only determine KS-associated angiogenesis, but also play a critical role in controlling KS cell growth and/or migration and invasion.

Kaposi's sarcoma vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF receptor human umbilical vein endothelial cells fetal calf serum phosphate-buffered saline antibody monoclonal Ab KS1 is an intensely angiogenic, multifocal proliferative disease of possible vascular origin (1Ruszczak Z. Mayer-Da Silva A. Orfanos C.E. Am. J. Dermopathol. 1987; 9: 388-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It is particularly frequent and aggressive when associated with infection by human immunodeficiency virus-1 (2Gottlieb G.J. Ackerman A.B. Human Pathol. 1981; 13: 882-892Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar), in contrast to classical KS, which is rare and indolent (2Gottlieb G.J. Ackerman A.B.

To date, the pathogenesis of KS is not completely understood, but in vivoand in vitro evidence indicates that this sarcoma probably develops from reactive, non-tumoral cells (6Ensoli B. Salahuddin S.Z. Gallo R.C. Cancer Cells. 1989; 1: 93-96PubMed Google Scholar, 7Brooks J.J. Lancet. 1986; 2: 1309-1311Abstract PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) that become characteristically “spindle”-shaped and induce angiogenesis when stimulated by a variety of cytokines and growth factors, including interleukin-1 and -6, interferon-γ, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, tumor necrosis factor-α, fibroblast growth factors, platelet-derived growth factor, chemokines, VEGF-A, transforming growth factors (reviewed in Ref. 8Ensoli B. Barillari G. Gallo R.C. Immunol. Rev. 1992; 127: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In later stages of development, a cell clone may assume neoplastic features, subsequent to genotypic alterations, causing KS hyperplastic lesions to transform into real sarcomas (9Albini A. Paglieri I. Orengo G. Carlone S. Aluigi M.G. DeMarchi R. Matteucci C. Mantovani A. Carozzi F. Donini S. Benelli R.

The nature of KS spindle cells has been debated for a long time. Recent studies indicate that these cells are a heterogeneous population with three distinct phenotypes, one reminiscent of activated vascular and lymphatic endothelial cells, the other one of macrophagic and dendritic cells, the last characterized by the presence of mixed markers of macrophage and endothelial cells (12Dictor V. Andersson C. Am. J. Pathol. 1988; 130: 411-417PubMed Google Scholar, 13Beckstead J.H. Wood G.S. Fletcher V. Am. J. Pathol. 1985; 119: 294-300PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kaaya E.E. Parravicini C.

Pathol. 1994; 173: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Cytokines exert a major role in KS development, at least in the beginning of the disease. Early lesions are infiltrated by inflammatory cells, mostly CD8+T cells and macrophages, producing a variety of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-2 (reviewed in Ref. 18Ensoli B. Sturzl M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1998; 9: 63-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), that induce normal cells to acquire the KS phenotype (19Fiorelli V. Gendelman R. Samaniego F. Markham P.D. Ensoli B. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1723-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Cytokines produced by inflammatory cells present in the lesions can also stimulate KS cells themselves to produce other soluble mediators, including angiogenic factors. These molecules dictate the progression of the lesion by autocrine and paracrine mechanisms, regulating cell recruitment and growth, with consequent angiogenesis and lesion formation (18Ensoli B. Sturzl M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1998; 9: 63-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Among these molecules, VEGF-A has been recently demonstrated to be involved in angiogenesis associated with KS by acting through an autocrine pathway. VEGF-A is produced by KS cells and promotes their growth both in vivo and in vitro in nude mice (20Cornali E. Zietz C. Benelli R. Weninger W. Masiello L. Breier G. Tschaler E. Albini A. Sturzl M. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 1851-1869PubMed Google Scholar, 21Masood R. Cai J. Zheng T. Smith D.L. Naidu Y. Gill P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 979-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). VEGF-A is present in KS lesions with basic fibroblast growth factor, which synergize to promote vascular permeability angiogenesis and further KS lesion formation (22Samaniego F. Markham P.D. Gendelman R. Watanabe Y. Kao V. Kowalski K. Sonnabend J.A. Pintus A. Gallo R.C. Ensoli B. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 1433-1443PubMed Google Scholar). VEGF-A is known as one of the first regulators of angiogenesis (reviewed in Refs. 23Bussolino F. Mantovani A. Persico G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 251-256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar and 24Ferrara N. Davis-Smyth T. Endocrinol. Rev. 1997; 18: 4-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). The recent identification of proteins with high similarity to VEGF-A led to the designation of a vascular endothelial family of growth factors, consisting of five members to date. In addition to VEGF-A, this family includes placental growth factor (25Maglione D. Guerriero V. Viglietto G. Ferraro M.G. Aprelikova O. Alitalo K. Del Vecchio S. Lei K.J. Chou J.Y. Persico M.G. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 925-931PubMed Google Scholar), VEGF-B (26Olofsson B. Pajusola K. Kaipainen A. von Euler G. Joukov V. Saksela O. Orpana A. Pettersson R.F. Alitalo K. Eriksson U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2576-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar), VEGF-C, VEGF-D (27Orlandini M. Marconcini L. Ferruzzi R. Oliviero S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sawano A. Yamaguchi S. Yazaki Y. Shibuya M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31273-31282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). VEGF-C was originally cloned as the specific ligand for VEGFR-3/Flt-4, a tyrosine-kinase receptor structurally related to VEGFR-1/Flt-1 and VEGFR-2/KDR, though unable to bind VEGF-A (29Joukov V. Pajusola K. Kaipainen A. Chilov D. Lahtinen I. Kukk E. Saksela O. Kalkkinen N. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). VEGF-C is produced as a 61-kDa precursor that undergoes progressive proteolytic maturation, increasing its affinity and activating properties toward VEGFR-3 (31Joukov V. Sorsa T. Kumar V. Jeltsch M. Claesson-Welsh L. Cao Y. Saksela O. Kalkkinen N. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3898-3911Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). VEGF-C has been identified as a specific regulator of lymphatic endothelia. In situ hybridization experiments in the mouse embryo show that both VEGF-C and VEGFR-3 are expressed at sites of lymphatic vessel formation (32Kukk E. Lymboussaki A. Taira S. Kaipainen A. Jeltsch M. Joukov V. Development ( Camb. ). 1996; 122: 3829-3837PubMed Google Scholar). In the skin of transgenic mice, the overexpression of VEGF-C has been shown to induce lymphatic endothelial cell proliferation and hyperplasia of the lymphatic vasculature (33Jeltsch M. Kaipanen A. Joukov V. Meng X. Lasko M. Rauvala H. Swartz M. Fukumura D. Jain R.K. Alitalo K. Science. 1997; 276: 1423-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in chicken mature chorioallantoic membrane assay, VEGF-C selectively induces growth of lymphatic vessels (34Oh S.J. Jeltsch M.M. Birkenhager R. McCarty J.E. Weich H.A. Christ B. Alitalo K. Wiltig J. Dev. Biol. 1997; 199: 96-109Crossref Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Targeted inactivation of the gene encoding for VEGFR-3 resulted in defective remodeling and maturation of primitive vascular structures and in cardiovascular failure, suggesting a role for the VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 pathway in the development of vascular system before the differentiation between blood and lymph vascular networks (35Dumont D.J. Jussila L. Taipale J. Lymboussaki A. Mustonen T. Pajusola K. Breitman M. Alitalo K. Science. 1998; 282: 946-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests a role for VEGF-C also in blood vascular system. In vitro, VEGF-C exhibits a mitogenic and chemotactic effect on vascular endothelial cells, and induction of angiogenesis in vitro by VEGF-C has been reported recently (29Joukov V. Pajusola K. Kaipainen A. Chilov D. Lahtinen I. Kukk E. Saksela O. Kalkkinen N. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar, 36Witzenbichler B. Asahara T. Murohara T.

Jeltsch M. Kumar V. Alitalo K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 439-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). A possible in vivo action of this factor in angiogenesis is now under question, as the expression of its specific receptor VEGFR-3 is barely detectable in mature blood vessels (37Cao Y. Linden P. Farnebo J. Cao R. Eriksno A. Kumar V. Qi J. Claesson-Welsh L. Alitalo K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14389-14394Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). However, the 21-kDa completely processed VEGF-C glycoprotein can also bind and activate VEGFR-2 (29Joukov V. Pajusola K. Kaipainen A. Chilov D. Lahtinen I. Kukk E. Saksela O. Kalkkinen N. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar), so that the biological activity of VEGF-C in endothelium could be mediated by this receptor. Recent studies in vivo showed that VEGF-C can promote angiogenesis in rabbit ischemic limbs (36Witzenbichler B. Asahara T. Murohara T. Silver M. Spyridopoulos I. Magner M. Principe N. Kearney M. Hu J.S. Isner J.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 381-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) and induce mouse cornea neovascularization and blood vessel development in chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane assay (37Cao Y. Linden P. Farnebo J. Cao R. Eriksno A. Kumar V. Qi J. Claesson-Welsh L. Alitalo K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14389-14394Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Because of the presence of VEGFR-3 in KS lesions in vivo(39Jussila L. Valtola R. Partanen T.A. Salven P. Heikkila P. Matikainen M.T. Renkonen R. Kaipanen A. Detmar M. Tschachler E. Alitalo R. Alitalo K. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1599-1604PubMed Google Scholar), in this study we analyzed the biological effect of VEGF-C on KS IMM, a KS-derived cell line that is very similar to typical spindle cell cultures established from KS lesions (9Albini A. Paglieri I. Orengo G. Carlone S. Aluigi M.G. DeMarchi R. Matteucci C. Mantovani A. Carozzi F. Donini S. Benelli R. AIDS. 1997; 11: 713-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). VEGF-C promotes KS IMM cells migration and proliferation by activating the tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3. These effects are evident also on human endothelial cells, indicating that VEGF-C could promote KS lesions by regulating functions of both KS spindle cells and associated endothelial cells. HUVEC were isolated from umbilical cord vein by collagenase treatment as described previously (40Bussolino F. Arese M. Montrucchio G. Barra L. Primo L. Benelli R. Sanavio F. Aglietta M. Ghigo D. Rola-Pleszczynski M.R. Albini A. Camussi G. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 940-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and used at passages 1–4. KS IMM cells were derived from a non-AIDS patient (9Albini A. Paglieri I. Orengo G. Carlone S. Aluigi M.G. DeMarchi R. Matteucci C. Mantovani A. Carozzi F. Donini S. Benelli R. AIDS. 1997; 11: 713-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and are immortalized without signs of senescence after more than 120in vitro passages. This cell line shares common markers and similar biological behavior with typical KS spindle cells (9Albini A. Paglieri I. Orengo G. Carlone S. Aluigi M.G. DeMarchi R. Matteucci C. Mantovani A. Carozzi F. Donini S. Benelli R. AIDS. 1997; 11: 713-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Cells were grown on gelatin-coated plastic, in medium 199 supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated FCS, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), heparin (50 μg/ml), and bovine brain extract (100 μg/ml) (Life Technologies, Inc., Milano, Italy). ΔNΔC 156S is a mutated form of VEGF-C in which Cys-156 has been replaced with a Ser (31Joukov V. Sorsa T. Kumar V. Jeltsch M. Claesson-Welsh L. Cao Y. Saksela O. Kalkkinen N. Alitalo K.

Recombinant mature form of human wild type (ΔNΔC) and mutant (ΔNΔC 156S) VEGF-C were expressed in Pichia pastoris yeast cells and purified as described previously (31Joukov V. Sorsa T. Kumar V.

Healthy 10-week-old athymic nu/nu male mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Colnago, Italy). KS IMM cells (3 × 106) were inoculated subcutaneously into the lower back of mice in the presence of matrigel (200 μl) (Collaborative Research, Bedford, MA). After 4–7 days from the injection, specimens were taken from the lesional sites, paraffin-embedded, and VEGFR-3 expression was analyzed immunohistochemically. Paraffin-embedded sections of nude mice lesions were processed through a series of decreasing ethanol concentrations and heated in a microwave oven in 10 mm sodium citrate (pH 6.0) at 750 watts for 10 min. Adjacent 5 μm sections were incubated with blocking serum (bovine serum albumin 100 mg/ml in PBS) and then with anti-VEGFR-3 mAb (1.1 μg/ml) (39Jussila L. Valtola R. Partanen T.A. Salven P.

Slides were stained by using the streptavidin/biotin system (Dako Immunoglobulins, Glostrup, Denmark). To detect VEGFR-3 in culture of KS IMM cells and HUVEC, cells were grown to confluence on gelatin-coated coverslips and fixed for 10 min in 3% paraformaldehyde, 2% saccharose in PBS (pH 7.6). Fixed cells were incubated with blocking reagent (10% v/v FCS in PBS) and then with anti-VEGFR-3 mAb (1.1 μg/ml) (39Jussila L. Valtola R. Partanen T.A. Salven P. Heikkila P. Matikainen M.T. Renkonen R. Kaipanen A. Detmar M. Tschachler E. Alitalo R. Alitalo K. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1599-1604PubMed Google Scholar) in a humid chamber for 30 min at 37 °C. Fluorescent staining was visualized with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary rabbit anti-mouse Ab (Sigma) and fluorescence microscopy. To assay mitogenic activity, KS IMM cells and HUVEC were seeded in 48-well plates (104cells/well) and allowed to attach for 24 h. The cells were then starved in M199 containing 1% FCS for 24 h (HUVEC) or 96 h (KS IMM). ΔNΔC or ΔNΔC 156S was added to the wells in medium containing 2.5% FCS at the indicated concentrations. All treatments were made in triplicate. Cells were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, stained with 0.1% crystal violet in 20% methanol, and solubilized in 10% acetic acid. Cell growth was evaluated by measuring absorbance at 590 nm in a microplate reader (Bio-Rad, model 3530). A calibration curve was set up with known numbers of cells and a linear correlation between absorbance and cell counts was established up to 1 × 105 cells. The cell migration assay was performed using a 48-well microchemotaxis chamber (Neuroprobe, Plaesanton, CA). Polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate filters (Nucleopore, Corning Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) with a pore size of 5 μm were coated with 1% gelatin for 10 min at room temperature and equilibrated in M199 supplemented with 1% FCS (40Bussolino F. Arese M. Montrucchio G. Barra L. Primo L. Benelli R. Sanavio F. Aglietta M. Ghigo D. Rola-Pleszczynski M.R. Albini A. Camussi G. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 940-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Indicated concentrations of ΔNΔC or ΔNΔC 156S were placed in the lower compartment of a Boyden chamber. Subconfluent cultures, which had been starved as above, were harvested in PBS (pH 7.4) with 10 mm EDTA, washed once in PBS, and resuspended in M199 containing 1% FCS at a final concentration of 2.5×106 cells/ml. After placing the filter between lower and upper chambers, 50 μl of the cell suspension were seeded in the upper compartment. Cells were allowed to migrate for 7 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. The filter was then removed, and cells on the upper side were scraped off with a rubber policeman. Migrated cells were fixed in methanol, stained with Giemsa solution (Diff-Quick, Baxter Diagnostics, Rome, Italy) and counted from five random high power fields (magnitude × 100) in each well. Each experimental point was studied in triplicate. The direction of VEGF-C-stimulated migration was evaluated in KS IMM cells using a checkerboard analysis (42Zigmond S.H. Hirsch J.G. J. Exp. Med. 1973; 137: 387-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). Increasing concentrations of ΔNΔC were placed in both top and bottom wells of the Boyden chamber in order to establish positive, absent, and negative concentration gradients across the filter barrier. Directed locomotion, chemotaxis, is a response to a gradient of attractant; random stimulated migration, chemokinesis, is the response to attractant when no concentration gradient is present. Subconfluent cultures were starved as above and then cells were stimulated with the indicated concentrations of ΔNΔC or ΔNΔC 156S for 15 min at room temperature. After three washes with cold PBS containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, cells were lysed for 20 min on ice in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm ZnCl2, and 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) (w/v). Lysates (1 mg of total proteins) were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with 100 μl of a 50% solution of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Rainham, Essex, United Kingdom) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and anti-VEGFR-2 (C-1158, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-VEGFR-3 Ab (43Pajusola K. Aprelikova O. Pelicci G. Weich H. Claesson-Welsh L. Alitalo K. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3545-3555PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with lysis buffer and analyzed by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred onto a nylon membrane (polyvinylidene difluoride, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Staining was performed by a chemiluminescence assay (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To determine whether KS IMM cells retain the ability to induce lesions resembling KS, nude mice were subcutaneously inoculated with 3 × 106 cells mixed with matrigel. In all mice, a lesion developed at the site of inoculation within 3–4 days, reaching maximal size by day 7, when the mice were sacrificed. Histologically, the macroscopic lesions induced by KS IMM cells were similar to those induced by other KS-derived cells (44Ensoli B. Gendelman R. Markham P. Fiorelli V. Colombini S. Raffeld M. Cafaro A. Chang H.K. Brady J.N. Gallo R.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 674-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). The neoplasia consisted of round and spindle cells, with vascular structures and capillaries and some infiltrated inflammatory cells (Fig.1). The tumoral cells had an abundant basophylic cytoplasm and a large nucleus with one or more nucleoli and fine chromatin. We analyzed the presence of VEGFR-3 in cultured KS IMM cells and HUVEC by immunofluorescence using an anti-VEGFR-3 mAb. The staining for VEGFR-3 was prominent (Fig. 1,A and B), and a similar pattern was observed in KS IMM-derived lesions in nude mice, evaluated by immunohistochemistry with the same anti-VEGFR-3 mAb (Fig. 1 D). A strong cytoplasmatic staining particularly pronounced in the Golgi apparatus was observed, probably due to the presence of the p175 VEGFR-3 precursor (31Joukov V. Sorsa T. Kumar V. Jeltsch M. Claesson-Welsh L. Cao Y. Saksela O. Kalkkinen N. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3898-3911Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Incubation with secondary Ab alone did not give a detectable staining (not shown). We tested the ability of VEGF-C to induce proliferation of KS IMM cells, using HUVEC as a control, since previous studies have shown a VEGF-C-induced mitogenic effect on endothelial cells (36Witzenbichler B. Asahara T. Murohara T. Silver M. Spyridopoulos I. Magner M. Principe N. Kearney M. Hu J.S. Isner J.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 381-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). On both KS IMM cells and HUVEC, ΔNΔC stimulated a dose-response effect, reaching maximal induction at 100 ng/ml (Fig. 2). The increment in cell number was about 150% in both cell types. The effect of VEGF-C on KS IMM cell migration was analyzed in the Boyden chamber assay. ΔNΔC exhibited a motogenic dose-response effect on KS IMM cells and on HUVEC, used as a positive control (31Joukov V. Sorsa T. Kumar V. Jeltsch M. Claesson-Welsh L. Cao Y. Saksela O. Kalkkinen N.

The KS IMM cell migration induced by ΔNΔC was more than 6-fold stronger when compared with untreated cells, while HUVEC were less responsive (Fig.3). The checkerboard analysis demonstrated that VEGF-C also has a chemokinetic component (increasing random migration) as well as a chemotactic component (TableI).Table IVEGF-C exhibits a chemokinetic effect on KS IMM cellsLower chamber concentrationsUpper chamber concentrationsControl10 ng/ml30 ng/mlControl5.40 ± 0.6010.80 ± 0.4414.00 ± 0.7410 ng/ml11.40 ± 0.6012.90 ± 0.7815.40 ± 0.6030 ng/ml15.00 ± 1.0820.20 ± 0.8622.60 ± 0.94a Migrated cells per fields.

VEGF-C has been demonstrated to activate both VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 tyrosine phosphorylation in NIH-3T3 and in porcine aortic endothelial cells respectively transfected with KDR andflt-4 cDNAs, which overexpress these proteins (29Joukov V.

To verify whether the biological responses observed in KS IMM cells and HUVEC were due to the activation of these receptors, tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 was analyzed. In a time course experiment, KS IMM cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml of ΔNΔC, a concentration sufficient to induce the mitogenic and motogenic response. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using a polyclonal anti-VEGFR-3 mAb, and proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted by an anti-phosphotyrosine mAb. Fig. 4 shows that tyrosine phosphorylation of the p125 proteolitically processed active form of VEGFR-3 increases after a 5-min stimulation, reaching a plateau after 15 min. Also the p195 unprocessed form of the receptor appears to be phosphorylated after 15 min, as observed previously in NIH-3T3 cells transfected with flt-4 cDNA (29Joukov V. Pajusola K. Kaipainen A.

ΔNΔC was able to activate the tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-3 in HUVEC as well as in KS IMM cells (Fig.5). Also VEGFR-2 was phosphorylated in response to ΔNΔC stimulation in both cell types (Fig. 5).Figure 5VEGF-C induces tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3.

SAPAP is Triton X-100-insoluble in both the brain homogenate and the transfected cells. It links PSD-95/SAP90 to the Triton X-100-insoluble structures of transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells (17Deguchi M. Hata Y. Takeuchi M. Ide N. Hirao K. Yao I. Irie M. Toyoda A. Takai Y. J. Biol.

BEGAIN is also recruited by SAPAP into the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction with PSD-95/SAP90 in Chinese hamster ovary cells (17Deguchi M. Hata Y. Takeuchi M. Ide N. Hirao K. Yao I. Irie M. Toyoda A. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26269-26272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). SAPAP interacts with another neuronal membrane-associated guanylate kinase, synaptic scaffolding molecule (S-SCAM), which also provides scaffolds for the components of synaptic junctions (18Hirao K. Hata Y. Ide N. Takeuchi M. Irie M. Yao I. Deguchi M. Toyoda A. Sudhof T.C. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21105-21110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Thereby, SAPAP is a key protein in the architecture of the PSD. The detergent-insolubility of SAPAP is conferred by its NH2-terminal and middle regions. The middle region contains 5 repeats of 14 amino acids (aa) and is involved in the interaction with PSD-95/SAP90 (14Kim E. Naisbitt S. Hsueh Y.-P. Rao A. Rothschild A. Craig A.M. Sheng M. J.

Akiyama T. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). A proline-rich region that fits to the consensus motif for the binding of the src homology 3 (SH3) domain exists immediately after the middle region (19Sparks A.B. Rider J.E. Hoffman N.G. Fowlkes D.M. Quilliam L.A. Kay B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1540-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal region is Triton X-100-soluble and well conserved among the four isoforms of SAPAP, suggesting that it may have some function. We have searched for a SAPAP-binding protein, identified a novel neuronal protein, which binds to the carboxyl-terminal region of SAPAP, and named it synamon. Rat brain yeast two-hybrid library was constructed using pVP16 vector and screened (20Hata Y. Butz S. Sudhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rat brain cDNA libraries (Stratagene andCLONTECH) were screened with the [α-32P]dCTP-labeled random-primed probes (20Hata Y. Butz S. Sudhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Various expression vectors were constructed by conventional molecular biology techniques and polymerase chain reaction method using pBTM116, pCMV Myc, pClneo Myc, and pGex4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). pBTM116 SAPAP2–1 contains full-length SAPAP2. The following constructs contain the following aa residues of SAPAP1: pCMV Myc SAPAP1–1, 1–992; pCMV Myc SAPAP1–2, 1–477; pCMV Myc SAPAP1–6, 478–992; pCMV Myc SAPAP1–8, 568–992; pClneo Myc SAPAP1–8, 800–992; and pClneo Myc SAPAP1–22, 800–985. The following constructs contain the following aa residues of synamon: pGex4T-1 synamon-16, 1977–2091; pGex4T-1 synamon-18, 616–1110; and pGex4T-1 synamon-19, 863–1337. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against the product of pGex4T-1 synamon-16, which is the COOH-terminal region of synamon. The anti-SAPAP antibody was described previously (15Takeuchi M. Hata Y. Hirao K. Toyoda A. Irie M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11943-11951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The mouse monoclonal anti-Myc-tag antibody was obtained from American Type Culture Collection. The rhodamine-conjugated and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated second antibodies for dual labeling were purchased from Chemicon. The monoclonal anti-NMDA receptor 1 antibody was a gift of Dr. Nils Brose (Max Planck Institute, Goettingen, Germany). COS cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium with 10% fetal bovine serum under 10% CO2 at 37 °C and transfected with various Myc-tagged constructs using the DEAE-dextran method (15Takeuchi M. Hata Y. Hirao K. Toyoda A. Irie M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11943-11951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). COS cells of two 10-cm plates were homogenized in 0.6 ml of 20 mmHepes/NaOH, pH 8.0, containing 6 m urea and 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was dialyzed against 2 liters of 20 mmHepes/NaOH, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm NaCl overnight, then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 15 min to remove the debris, and used as the COS cell extracts. 0.5-ml aliquots of the extracts of COS cells expressing various Myc-tagged constructs of SAPAP1 were incubated with 800 pmol of various GST fusion proteins fixed on 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. After the beads were washed with Buffer A (20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm NaCl and 1% (w/v) Triton X-100), the proteins on the beads were detected by immunoblotting using the anti-Myc antibody. The urea/detergent extracts of rat crude synaptosomes were prepared as described (17Deguchi M. Hata Y. Takeuchi M. Ide N. Hirao K. Yao I. Irie M. Toyoda A. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26269-26272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). 4-ml aliquots of the extracts were incubated with 30 μl of the anti-SAPAP serum or the preimmune serum fixed on protein G-Sepharose Fast Flow beads. After the beads were washed three times with Buffer A, the proteins on the beads were detected by immunoblotting using the anti-synamon antibody. Subcellular fractionation of rat brain, primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons, immunocytostaining, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and protein determination were performed as described (15Takeuchi M. Hata Y. Hirao K. Toyoda A. Irie M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11943-11951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Northern and Western blottings were performed using multiple tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) and ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), respectively. We performed the yeast two-hybrid screening of a rat brain cDNA library using a bait containing full-length SAPAP2 (pBTM116 1305–1). We obtained 6 positive independent clones from 8 × 105 clones; 4 clones were PSD-95/SAP90, and the remaining two clones, pPrey 3102 and 3103, were encoded novel proteins. pPrey 3102 and pPrey 3103 interacted with not only SAPAP2 but also SAPAP1, -3, and -4 in the yeasts (data not shown). We started the cDNA library screenings to obtain the full-length sequences of these two genes to find that they are alternative splicing isoforms. We obtained the presumptive full-length coding sequence of synamon through the conventional hybridization screening and polymerase chain reaction (Fig. 1). The protein, synamon, was composed of 2,158 aa. The NH2 terminus had 7 ankyrin repeats followed by one SH3 and one PDZ domain. pPrey 3103 contained the residues 404–902 of synamon with an insert of 9 aa (Ile-Leu-Ile-Asp-Gly-Ile-Asp-Ser-Gly) between the residues 644 and 645 (at the triangle in Fig. 1). Several independent clones contained the same insert at the same position. pPrey 3102 contained the residues 646–776 of synamon preceded by an additional 50 aa, which were unique for pPrey 3102. The constructs used in this study were prepared from the clone without the insert. Synamon had the homology toCaenorhabditis elegans C33B4.3, which had 6 ankyrin repeats and one PDZ domain without an SH3 domain. The software TopPred in the simple modular architecture research tool predicted the residues 1793–1813 as a transmembrane domain (21Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (2972) Google Scholar), but another software, SOSUI in GenomeNet WWW server, predicted a soluble protein. Synamon has several proline-rich regions in the COOH-terminal region (boxed in Fig. 1). We confirmed the binding of synamon to SAPAP in the crude synaptosomes. Synamon was coimmunoprecipitated with SAPAP from the rat crude synaptosomes (Fig. 2 A). Next, we determined which region of SAPAP was involved in the interaction with synamon. Both pPrey 3102 and pPrey 3103 contained the region around the PDZ domain of synamon (underlined in Fig. 1), and this region was conceivably the SAPAP-interacting region of synamon. We prepared two GST fusion proteins of synamon, GST-synamon-18 and -19, and tested the interactions with various Myc-tagged constructs of SAPAP1 (Fig. 2 B). GST-synamon-18 covered the putative SAPAP-interacting region around the PDZ domain, whereas GST-synamon-19 did not contain it. GST-Synamon-18 interacted with full-length SAPAP1 and its COOH-terminal region, but not with the NH2-terminal region (Fig. 2 C). The deletion of COOH-terminal 7 amino acids of SAPAP1 abolished the interaction with GST-synamon-18. GST-synamon-19 did not interact with any Myc-tagged constructs of SAPAP1. The GST-synamon-18 and -19 did not cover the whole sequence of synamon, and we could not exclude the possibility that some untested region of synamon binds to the NH2-terminal and/or middle regions of SAPAP1. The current result, however, indicates that the synamon-interacting region of SAPAP1 is the COOH-terminal region and distinct from the PSD-95/SAP90-interacting middle region. Northern blot analysis revealed a 9.0-kilobase message only in brain (Fig. 3 A). No message was detected in heart, spleen, lung, liver, kidney, skeletal muscles, or testis. Western blot analysis showed a signal with a molecular mass of 288 kDa only in brain (Fig. 3 B). The signal of a molecular mass of 182 kDa was also detected. Because the calculated molecular weight of synamon is 225,508, the 288-kDa protein is likely to be synamon and the 182-kDa protein may be a degradation product or a short isoform. In rat hippocampal neurons, synamon was localized in the cell body and the dendrites (Fig.4 A). On the dendrites, synamon was colocalized with NMDA receptor 1 (Fig. 4 A). Because SAPAP was colocalized with NMDA receptor 1 (Fig. 4 B), synamon was considered to be colocalized with SAPAP in rat hippocampal neurons.Figure 4Subcellular localization of synamon in neurons.

Synamon was coimmunoprecipitated with GKAP/SAPAP/DAP from rat crude synaptosomes. Synamon was not remarkably enriched in the PSD fraction and distributed in the soma and neurites of rat primary cultured hippocampal neurons. However, at dendrites, synamon was colocalized with NMDA receptors and GKAP/SAPAP/DAP. These findings suggest that synamon interacts with GKAP/SAPAP/DAP in vivo. Synamon has a characteristic molecular structure composed of ankyrin repeats, an SH3 domain, a PDZ domain, and proline-rich sequences. Synamon interacts with the COOH-terminal region of GKAP/SAPAP/DAP via its middle region containing a PDZ domain. Although ligands for domains other than the PDZ domain of synamon need to be clarified, synamon may interact with unidentified molecules and link them to GKAP/SAPAP/DAP to form the architecture of the PSD. We submitted the sequence of synamon to the GenBank™ in November, 1998 and corrected a sequencing error in May, 1999. After the submission of this work to the Journal of Biological Chemistry, one group reported the same protein as a protein interacting with GKAP/SAPAP/DAP, cortactin, and Homer and named it Shank (Naisbitt, S., Kim, E., Tu, J. C., Xiao, B., Sala, C., Valtschanoff, J., Weinberg, R. J., Worley, P. F., and Sheng, M. (1999)Neuron 23,569–582 and Tu, J. C., Xiao, B., Naisbitt, S., Yuan, J. P., Petralia, R. S., Brakeman, P., and Doan, A., Aakalu, V., K., Lanahan, A. A., Sheng, M., and Worley, P. F. (1999)Neuron 23,583–592). Another group directly submitted a gene named SPANK-1 to the GenBank™ (AF159016) (Tobaben, S., Sudhof, T. C., and Stahl, B.). Shank 1a, synamon, and SPANK-1 are identical. The protein named ProSAP1/CortBP1 was identified as a synaptic cortactin-binding protein (Boeckers, T. M., Kruetz, M. R., Winter, C., Zuschratter, W., Smalla, K.-H., Sanmarti-Vila, L., Wex, H., Langnaese, K., Bockmann, J., Garner, C. C., and Gundelfinger, E. D. (1999) J. Neurosci. 19,6506–6518). The authors compared the sequences of ProSAP1/CortBP1 and synamon and discussed that synamon was an isoform of ProSAP1/CortBP1. Although the authors used the sequence of synamon that we submitted originally and that had a sequencing error, their conclusion was correct, and Shank la/synamon/SPANK-1 is an isoform of ProSAP1/CortBP1."
https://openalex.org/W2167590641,"Aspartic proteinases (AP) have been widely studied within the living world, but so far no plant AP have been structurally characterized. The refined cardosin A crystallographic structure includes two molecules, built up by two glycosylated peptide chains (31 and 15 kDa each). The fold of cardosin A is typical within the AP family. The glycosyl content is described by 19 sugar rings attached to Asn-67 and Asn-257. They are localized on the molecular surface away from the conserved active site and show a new glycan of the plant complex type. A hydrogen bond between Gln-126 and Manβ4 renders the monosaccharide oxygen O-2 sterically inaccessible to accept a xylosyl residue, therefore explaining the new type of the identified plant glycan. The Arg-Gly-Asp sequence, which has been shown to be involved in recognition of a putative cardosin A receptor, was found in a loop between two β-strands on the molecular surface opposite the active site cleft. Based on the crystal structure, a possible mechanism whereby cardosin A might be orientated at the cell surface of the style to interact with its putative receptor from pollen is proposed. The biological implications of these findings are also discussed. Aspartic proteinases (AP) have been widely studied within the living world, but so far no plant AP have been structurally characterized. The refined cardosin A crystallographic structure includes two molecules, built up by two glycosylated peptide chains (31 and 15 kDa each). The fold of cardosin A is typical within the AP family.

The biological implications of these findings are also discussed. aspartic proteinases plant-specific insert root mean square asymmetric unit Aspartic proteinases (AP)1 are a class of enzymes (EC 3.4.23) involved in a number of physiological and pathological processes such as blood pressure homeostasis (renin), retroviral infection (human immunodeficiency virus proteinase), hemoglobin degradation in malaria (plasmepsin), intracellular proteolysis (cathepsin D),and digestion (pepsin) (see Ref. 1James M.N.G. Aspartic proteinases. Plenum Press, New York1998Crossref Google Scholar for a recent review). Additionally, AP play an important role in the food industry,e.g. the cheese industry (chymosin) or in soya and cocoa processing. Inhibitors of AP enzymes have significant therapeutic potential for treatment of hypertension, AIDS, tumor invasiveness, and peptic ulcer disease. Despite their distribution in the living world, occurring from retrovirus to mammals, aspartic proteinases share significant similarities in primary and tertiary structures. Members of this class display two Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly motifs within their sequences and are specifically inhibited by pepstatin, a peptide produced byStreptomyces. Several high resolution x-ray structures of mammalian, fungal, and retroviral aspartic proteinases are available. The overall three-dimensional structure consists of two domains of similar secondary structure, dominated by orthogonally packed sheets with several small helical segments. In eukaryotic aspartic proteinases each domain contributes one of the two catalytic aspartate residues to form the active site center located at a long and deep cleft between the two domains. Conversely, in retroviral aspartic proteinases, which are dimeric proteins consisting of two identical subunits, each subunit contributes one catalytic aspartate. It is thought therefore that eukaryotic aspartic proteinases have evolved divergently from a primitive dimeric enzyme resembling retroviral proteinases by gene duplication and fusion. Plant AP have been detected, extracted, and characterized from seeds, leaves, and flowers of a broad variety of plant species, being probably involved in specific physiological roles (2Kervinen J.

They are also found in the digestive pitcher fluid of insectivorous plants (3Tokes Z.A. Woon W.C. Chambers S.M. Planta. 1974; 119: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although known plant AP sequences show similarities to those of other AP, most of them contain in their cDNAs an insertion coding for a polypeptide segment of about 100 residues, known as PSI (plant-specific insert). The PSI bears no similarities to animal or microbial AP but shows significant sequence similarities with cDNA saposin precursor sequences (4Guruprasad K. Tormakangas K. Kervinen J. Blundell T.L. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This saposin-like domain has been shown to be removed entirely or partially during maturation and processing of plant aspartic proteinase precursors (5Ramalho-Santos M. Verı́ssimo P. Cortes L.

The enzyme is accumulated in protein storage vacuoles of the stigmatic papillae, the female receptive organ, being also present, although less abundantly, in vacuoles of the epidermic cells of the style (11Ramalho-Santos M.

A unique feature of cardosin A among plant aspartic proteinases is the presence of an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence, a well known cell attachment motif characteristic of integrin-binding proteins (12D'Souza S.E. Ginsberg M.H. Plow E.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 246-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). This sequence, which has also been identified in the cardosin A-like proteinase from the stigmas of Cynara humilis, is apparently involved in the interaction between the proteinase and a 100-kDa protein from pollen. 2C.

Together with its putative receptor, cardosin A is thought to participate in adhesion-mediated proteolytic mechanisms that operate in pollen-pistil interaction. The present paper presents the mature cardosin A crystallographic structure with extensive description of its glycans and localization of the putative RGD adhesion site. Cardosin A was isolated and purified according to Verı́ssimo et al. (13Verı́ssimo P. Faro C. Moir A.J. Lin Y. Tang J. Pires E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Crystals of the glycosylated enzyme were obtained by the vapor diffusion method using PEG 4k as precipitating agent and were optimized by macro seeding (14Bento I. Frazão C. Coelho R. Wilson K. Dauter Z. Carrondo M.A. Acta Cryst. D. 1998; 54: 991-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). They belong to the monoclinic space group C2, with cell dimensions shown in Table I, and contain two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Diffraction data from three different crystals were successively obtained. The first crystal did not diffract beyond 2.85 Å resolution at room temperature and was prone to radiation damage when using synchrotron radiation at DESY, EMBL outstation in Hamburg, Germany. The second crystal measured with in-house equipment, led to similar data quality if under cryogenic conditions. Finally, the third crystal, under cryogenic conditions and with synchrotron radiation, diffracted to 1.72 Å (14Bento I. Frazão C. Coelho R. Wilson K. Dauter Z. Carrondo M.A. Acta Cryst. D. 1998; 54: 991-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The first data set was used for structure determination and for the starting refinement cycles. The late stages of refinement were calculated with data composed by the highest resolution set completed with data from the in-house collection, in particular for the strongest, low resolution intensities (see Table Ifor final data statistics). The diffraction images were integrated with DENZO, and intensities were scaled and merged with SCALEPACK (15Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Collins J. Silva A.M. Erickson W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6796-6800Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) as search model. The molecular replacement solution found for the two molecules, using 15–3.5-Å data, showed a correlation coefficient 47% (33% for the first noise peak) and an R factor of 45.5% (57% for the first noise pick). In early stages of refinement a target sequence was used, composed partially of cardosin A sequence (that had not been totally determined by then) and completed with the cyprosin sequence (18Cordeiro M.C. Xue Z.T. Pietrzak M. Pais M.S. Brodelius P.E. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 733-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A model based on the cathepsin D structure was constructed, where alanines replaced all residues that differed between the target and the cathepsin D sequences. These were mutated to the expected sequence at a later stage, along with the refinement progress. Refinement was initially carried out with data to 2.85 Å and X-PLOR, using the simulated annealing/slow cooling protocol with strict non-crystallographic symmetry (19Brünger A.T. X-PLOR, Version 3.1. Yale University, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar). Electron density maps with sigmaA coefficients (20Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1986; 42: 140-149Crossref Scopus (2035) Google Scholar) were examined using TURBO (21Roussell A. Fontecilla-Champs J.C. Cambillau C. Authier A. Collected Abstracts of XV IUCr Congress, Bordeaux, July 19–28 , 1990. IUCr Congress, Bordeaux1990: 66-67Google Scholar), and the model was gradually completed and corrected, alternating with X-PLOR refinement cycles. When the complete cardosin A sequence was obtained and the final diffraction data to a resolution of 1.72 Å was available, the refinement proceeded using SHELXL with restrained (1–4 distances) non-crystallographic symmetry positional refinement and restrained non-crystallographic symmetry atomic displacement factor refinement (22Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar). Solvent molecules were gradually introduced; some side chains were modeled with alternative conformations; crystal anisotropic correction was applied, and riding model hydrogen atoms were also refined (see Table I for final refinement statistics). Coordinates have been deposited in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank under accession code1b5f. The structure of molecule A of cardosin without sugar residues or water molecules, with the exception of the catalytic water, was used in the energy minimization studies. The peptide Leu-Ser-Phe-Met-Ala-Leu was built in the active site with capped terminal ends (an acetyl group for the N-terminal and anN-methyl for the C-terminal) to avoid end charge effects. Hydrogen atoms were positioned using GROMOS (23van Gunsteren W.F. Berendsen H.J.C. Groningen Molecular Simulation ( GROMOS ) Library Manual. Biomos B.V., Groningen1987Google Scholar), and their position was optimized using 1000 steps of steepest descents energy minimization. The initially docked structure was energy-minimized for 500 steps of steepest descents method while keeping all cardosin atoms fixed by the use of positional restraints. Finally, the system was subjected to a further 10,000 cycles of steepest descents energy minimization. Positional restrains were used for C-α atoms outside of the active site zone and adjacent flaps to ensure the preservation of the main fold of the protein under the pseudo-vacuum conditions. These calculations were performed using the GROMOS force field with polar and aromatic hydrogen atoms (23van Gunsteren W.F. Berendsen H.J.C. Groningen Molecular Simulation ( GROMOS ) Library Manual. Biomos B.V., Groningen1987Google Scholar, 24Smith L.J. Mark A.E. Dobson C.M. van Gunsteren W.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10918-10931Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and, since solvent was not included, with a modified version of the program PROEM implementing the distance-dependent dielectric function of Mehler and Solmajer (25Mehler E.L. Solmajer T. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 903-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). In order to compare cardosin A with other known AP structures, the pepsin sequence numbering (26Sielicki A.R. Fedorov A.A. Boodhoo A. Andreeva N.S. James M.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 143-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) was used to name the cardosin A residues throughout this paper. The refined cardosin A crystallographic structure includes two independent, glycosylated, aspartic protease molecules, composed of two (30 and 15 kDa) peptide chains, in a total of 649 amino acids in the asymmetric unit (a.u.). The glycosyl content is described by 19 sugar rings attached to the protein moieties. The sugars are localized on the molecular surface, distributed between two glycosylation sites in each of the molecules, i.e. one site per polypeptide chain. Whereas the N termini of both molecules are not visible in the electron density maps, the two C termini could be fully modeled. The cardosin A sequence begins with the hydrophilic segment (5Ramalho-Santos M. Verı́ssimo P. Cortes L. Samyn B. van Beeumen J. Pires E. Faro C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) Asp−2, Ser−1, Gly0, and it is therefore conceivable that the N terminus may be disordered in the solvent. In particular, molecule 1 was modeled beginning on Gly0 and molecule 2 from Ser−1 onward. For the C terminus, on the contrary, one finds a mainly hydrophobic sequence, Phe322, Ala323, Glu324, Ala325, and Ala326. This sequence, essentially conserved among plant AP that also contain the PSI, has been proposed by Faro and co-workers (5Ramalho-Santos M. Verı́ssimo P. Cortes L. Samyn B. van Beeumen J. Pires E. Faro C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) to play a role in vacuolar signaling, as it is known to be sufficient for the vacuolar targeting of barley lectin (27Dombrowski J.E. Schroeder M.R. Bednarek S.Y. Raikhel N.V. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 587-596PubMed Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that this C-terminal sequence is well defined on both cardosin A molecules, with an average temperature factor (B) of 17.9 A2. Data from primary sequence analysis (5Ramalho-Santos M. Verı́ssimo P. Cortes L. Samyn B. van Beeumen J. Pires E. Faro C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) have shown that the PSI excision occurs between residues 238 and 240, with a small heterogeneity occurring at the N terminus of the 15-kDa chain. The electron density allows positioning of Asn238, the C terminus of the first chain, but fades away afterward and appears back only by Glu243, which is in accordance with the absence of PSI in mature cardosin A. This excision is located where AP structures usually have a solvent-exposed loop, at the end of a conserved anti-parallel β-sheet, covering the crest of the C domain, at one side of the active site canyon. Solvent molecules, in a total of 528, were modeled as waters, and a total of 18 residues (including two of the sugar units) were modeled using two alternate conformations. As cardosin A is essentially formed (Fig.1 a) by the duplication of a motif of four anti-parallel β-strands and a helix, which is repeated twice in each domain, a characteristic of the AP family (28Blundell T.L. Jenkins J.A. Pearl L.H. Sewell B.T. Pedersen V. Kostka V. Aspartic Proteinases and Their Inhibitors. de Gruyter, Berlin1985: 151-161Crossref Google Scholar, 29Blundell T.L. Jenkins J.A. Sewell B.T. Pearl L.H. Cooper J.B. Tickle I.J. Veerapandian B. Wood S.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 919-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), the Ramachandran plot shows a clustering on the β domain (45.3% of β-strands and 13.5% of helical motifs). A stereochemical check of the molecules with PROCHECK (30Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) indicated the presence of 89.9% amino acids in the most favored region, 9.5% in the additional allowed region, 0.2% in the generously allowed region, and finally 0.4% (2 amino acids) in the disallowed region. This last pair corresponds to Leu295 residues of both molecules, modeled with very clear electron density maps, and located on the tip of a type IV β-turn, lying on the molecular surface but with relevant hydrophobic interactions with inner protein moiety. The distribution of isotropic displacement parameters is reasonable with an average B of 23.0 Å2 for the buried atoms and with higher values where no secondary structure was assigned. There is a clear correlation between high B factors and those residues that do not superimpose upon fitting the two molecules. They show equivalent folds, deviating significantly from one another (more than twice the overall main chain r.m.s. of 0.474 Å) only for residues 45–48 and 253–254 which are involved in crystal packing contacts, or on the poorly defined loops (see below). The final maps are in general very clear, as expected from 1.72-Å resolution data. However, there were three solvent-exposed loop regions that could not be modeled using the electron density maps alone. They were at the end of the “flap,” between residues 75 and 79, and the variable loops 46 to 47 and 159 to 160. Three disulfide bridges were found in the cardosin A mature protein, two within the first peptide chain (Cys45/Cys56and Cys206/Cys210) and the third within the second peptide chain (Cys249/Cys282), at positions known to form inter-cysteinyl bonds in the AP family (31Kostka V. Aspartic Proteinases and Their Inhibitors. de Gruyter, Berlin1985Crossref Google Scholar). These three covalent bridges do not link the two peptide chains, which are therefore held together only by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds arising with the AP fold. One cis-peptide bond was found between Thr22 and Pro23. This cis-Pro is a conserved feature of the AP family, on the tip of a conserved VIb β-turn. The two cardosin A molecules in the a.u. (Fig. 1 A) are related by a pseudo-crystallographic 2-fold axis (32Bento I. Coelho R. Frazão C. Costa J. Faro C. Verı́ssimo P. Pires E. Cooper J. Dauter Z. Wilson K. Carrondo M.A. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1998; 436: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) and present an intriguing intermolecular surface. The inter-molecular contacts require only 4.4% of each monomer's accessible surface area, but they are spread over a substantial area (Fig. 1 B). A total of 38 atomic contacts between the two molecules are closer than 4.0 Å, including 3 salt bridges. Only two water molecules were found bridging the two molecules. For comparison purposes, the crystal packing contacts between pairs of molecules involve in some cases a larger number of interactions (up to 68), but they are spread over a significantly smaller accessible surface. The secondary structure consists essentially of β-strands and some helical motifs and follows the pepsin-like single chain folding topology (33Davies D.R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 19: 189-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). The molecule is bilobal with two domains separated by a large cleft where the active site is located. As cardosin A is the first AP from the plant kingdom whose structure has been determined, a run of COMPARER (34Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 403-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), using a representative set of AP crystallographic structures, was performed to compare in detail the cardosin A model against other members of the AP family. The three-dimensional comparison also took into account local environmental variables such as types of hydrogen bonding, amino acid solvent accessibility, Ramachandran parameters, cis-peptide, and disulfide bonds. The comparison was carried out against the models of vacuolar yeast proteinase A (35Aguilar C.F. Cronin N.B. Badasso M. Dreyer T. Newman M.P. Cooper J.B. Hoover D.J. Wood S.P. Johnson M.S.

The identification of the residues involved in substrate specificity for individual AP has been pursued in order to understand the specificity determinants for each new member of the family and is an important source of motivation in site-directed mutation studies. It is the base for rationalization of the enzyme activity versusselectivity relationships. The physiological cardosin A substrate has not yet been definitely established, but the most important human application of cardosins is manufacture of exquisite cheese. In order to identify the residues involved in substrate binding, it was necessary to obtain a model of cardosin A-substrate transition state complex as no structure of cardosin A complexed to a peptide inhibitor has yet been obtained. However, the substrate-binding pockets can be identified by analogy with other AP, for which structures of enzyme-inhibitor complexes have been determined. The structure of an inhibitor complexed with renin (41Dhanaraj V. Dealwis C.G. Frazão C. Badasso M. Sibanda B.L. Tickle I.J. Cooper J.B. Driessen H.P. Newman M. Aguilar C. Wood S.P. Blundell T.L.

This was the first guide to model a fragment of κ-casein, corresponding to residues 102–108, containing the specific Phe105–Met106 bond that is cleaved in the proteolysis of milk micelle proteins in the production of cheese (9Ramalho-Santos M. Verı́ssimo P. Faro C. Pires E.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1297: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The docked structure was energy-minimized keeping cardosin C-α atoms outside the active site zone and adjacent flap restrained to their initial positions to ensure the preservation of the main fold of the protein under the pseudo-vacuum conditions of the minimization. The optimization of the enzyme-substrate complex led to only minor changes in the structure of the free enzyme (data not shown), an indication of the specificity of the enzyme toward this particular substrate sequence. Residues on each of the specificity sub-sites were defined as those having atoms within 4.0 Å of residues flanking the scissile Phe—Met bond (Fig. 3), corresponding to 127 atomic contacts including five putative hydrogen bonds. These involve almost exclusively main chain atoms, with the exception for the cardosin Thr218 OG1, κ-casein Phe105 N contact. In common with the other AP, the active site of cardosin A is located between the two lobes of the molecule at the bottom of a large cleft. The base of the active site cleft is made of β-strands forming"

Previous studies have shown that deletion events can occur in Escherichia coli by replication slippage between short duplications and that the main E. coli polymerase, DNA polymerase III holoenzyme is prone to such slippage. In this work, we present evidence that the two other DNA polymerases of E. coli, DNA polymerase I and DNA polymerase II, as well as polymerases of two phages, T4 (T4 pol) and T7 (T7 pol), undergo slippage in vitro, whereas DNA polymerase from another phage, Φ29, does not. Furthermore, we have measured the strand displacement activity of the different polymerases tested for slippage in the absence and in the presence of the E. colisingle-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB), and we show that: (i) polymerases having a strong strand displacement activity cannot slip (DNA polymerase from Φ29); (ii) polymerases devoid of any strand displacement activity slip very efficiently (DNA polymerase II and T4 pol); and (iii) stimulation of the strand displacement activity byE. coli SSB (DNA polymerase I and T7 pol), by phagic SSB (T4 pol), or by a mutation that affects the 3′ → 5′ exonuclease domain (DNA polymerase II exo− and T7 pol exo−) is correlated with the inhibition of slippage. We propose that these observations can be interpreted in terms of a model, for which we have shown that high strand displacement activity of a polymerase diminishes its propensity to slip.

This process, designated replication slippage (as well as copy-choice recombination), has been suspected for a long time to occur both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes between repeated DNA sequences. The process is thought to encompass the following steps: (i) copying of the first duplication by the replication machinery, (ii) replication pausing and dissociation of the polymerase from the newly synthesized end, (iii) unpairing of the newly synthesized strand and its pairing with the second duplication, and (iv) resumption of the DNA synthesis. A heteroduplex is thus formed, containing one parental and one recombinant strand, which are separated by a second round of replication. Replication slippage has been widely proposed as a probable mechanism of genome rearrangements, such as deletions between short duplications in bacteria (1Trinh T.Q. Sinden R.R.

Sinden R.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Direct evidence for the slippage has been obtained in vivo, in E. coli (13d'Alençon E. Petranovic M. Michel B. Noirot P. Aucouturier A. Uzest M. Ehrlich S.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2725-2734Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and in vitro (14Canceill D. Ehrlich S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6647-6652Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the latter study, it was shown that E. coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (pol III HE),1the enzyme that replicates the cell chromosome (for review see Ref.15Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 171-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), was able to slip, which is of particular significance in view of the very high replication accuracy required to maintain the integrity of the genome. In the present work we tested the slippage ability of the two other DNA polymerases from E. coli, pol I and pol II, and three phage DNA polymerases from T4, T7, and Φ29 to provide insight in the generality of this kind of replication mistakes and in its mechanism. Pol I is involved in DNA repair and completion of Okazaki fragments (16Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York, N.Y.1992: 165-196Google Scholar); it does not usually replicate long stretches of DNA and has been shown previously in vitro to cause frameshifts and strand switching (16Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York, N.Y.1992: 165-196Google Scholar, 17Papanicolaou C. Ripley L.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 207: 335-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Pol I contains several enzymatic activities in a single polypeptide chain; proteolytic cleavage can separate this chain into two active fragments: a large C-terminal fragment (Klenow fragment or pol I KF) carrying polymerase and 3′ → 5′ exonuclease (proofreading) activities, and a small N-terminal fragment containing 5′ → 3′ exonuclease activity (16Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York, N.Y.1992: 165-196Google Scholar). For a long time, the role of pol II was not clearly assigned, but recent evidence suggests that it functions during adaptive mutagenesis and translesion DNA synthesis (18Escarceller M. Hicks J. Gudmundsson G. Trump G. Touati D. Lovett S. Foster P.L. McEntee K. Goodman M.F. J. Bact. 1994; 10: 6221-6228Crossref Google Scholar, 19Paz-Elisur T. Takeshita M. Goodman M. O'Donnell M. Livneh Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24662-24669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that pol II might replace pol III HE during replication of the chromosome (20Rangarajan S. Gudmundsson G. Qiu Z. Foster P.L. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 946-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Pol II is a monomeric enzyme, with polymerase and proofreading activities; unlike pol I, it is able to use the accessory subunits of pol III (the γ complex and the β subunit), which strongly stimulate synthesis by increasing pol II processivity (21Hughes Jr., A.J. Bryan S.K. Chen H. Moses R.E. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4568-4573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Bonner C.A. Stukenberg P.T. Rajagopalan M. Eritja R. O'Donnell M. McEntee K. Echols H. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11431-11438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA polymerases from phages T4 and T7 are well characterized enzymes (for reviews see Refs. 23Young M.C. Reddy M.K. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8675-8690Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar and 24Richardson C.C. Cell. 1983; 33: 315-317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In the case of T4 pol, we studied the action of the catalytic polymerase subunit alone (the gene 43 product, or gp43), which has proofreading activity, and refer to it in this study as T4 pol. The complete holoenzyme contains in addition three accessory proteins and a specific single-stranded DNA-binding protein (the gene 32 product, or gp32). T7 pol is a highly processive enzyme constituted of 2 subunits: the gene 5 product (gp5), which contains both polymerase and proofreading activities, and a host-encoded protein, called thioredoxin, which acts as a processivity factor (25Debyser Z. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 157-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We refer here to the gp5-thioredoxin complex as T7 pol. The Bacillus subtilis phage Φ29 polymerase (Φ29 pol) is also very well characterized (for reviews see Refs. 26Salas M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 39-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar and 27Blanco L. Salas M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8509-8512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It is a protein-primed DNA polymerase that contains polymerase and proofreading activities in a single polypeptide, does not have a separate processivity subunit, and replicates very long stretches of duplex DNA in the absence of any helicase, because it possesses a strong strand displacement activity (28Blanco L. Bernad A. Lazaro J.M. Martin G. Garmendia C. Salas M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8935-8940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We show here that all polymerases except that of phage Φ29 can slip during replication, albeit with different efficiencies, and demonstrate that the propensity of a polymerase to slip is decreased by its strand displacement activity. We have previously observed that single-stranded DNA-binding protein ofE. coli (SSB) stimulates slippage of pol III HE (14Canceill D. Ehrlich S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6647-6652Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and therefore decided to test its effect on the other polymerases. SSB is essential for cell viability and is involved in various DNA transactions, such as replication, recombination, and repair (for reviews see Refs. 29Meyer R.R. Laine P.S. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 342-380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 30Lohman T.M. Ferrari M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 527-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). It suppresses secondary structures in DNA but has no unwinding activity. It may also interact directly with DNA polymerases, as reported for pol II (62Molineux I.J. Gefter M.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 811-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and for the χ subunit of pol III (63Kelman Z. Yushakov A. Andjelkovic J. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2436-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 64Glover B.P. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23476-23484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Here we present evidence that the efficiency of the replication slippage of different polymerases is affected in a different way by the E. coli SSB. The protein inhibits slippage of pol I and T7 pol, does not affect that of pol II and T4 pol, and is able to stimulate that of pol III HE. We show in this work that SSB affects the capacity of different polymerases to slip by modulating their strand displacement activity rather than by a suppression of secondary structures in DNA. Pol II and pol II exo− were kind gifts of Dr. M. Goodman (University of Southern California, Los Angeles). Φ29 pol (wild type and exo−) were kind gifts of Dr. M. Salas and Dr. L. Blanco (Centro de Biologı́a Molecular, Madrid, Spain). Pol III was purified as described (14Canceill D. Ehrlich S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6647-6652Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Pol I, pol I KF, T4 pol, and gp32 were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. T7 pol was purchased from New England Biolabs. T7 pol exo− (SequenaseTM, version 2) was from U. S. Biochemical Corp., and sequencing on single- or double-stranded DNA templates was carried out according to the protocol of the Sequenase version 2 sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). E. coliSSB was purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Proteinase K was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. For all polymerases, we have used the units defined for pol I: one unit of enzyme catalyzes the incorporation of 10 nmol of total nucleotide into acid insoluble material in 30 min at 37 °C. [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol), [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol), and [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Unlabeled nucleotides were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Plasmids pHP727FXb and pHP727FXc (see Fig. 1), the preparation of the ssDNA templates, and the primer extension reaction have been described previously (14Canceill D. Ehrlich S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6647-6652Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, a primer designated 1233 (24-mer) was annealed 1235 bases from the palindrome. All primer extension reactions contained in 10 μl: 25–75 ng of primed ssDNA, 250 μmdNTP (each) if 32P-labeled primer was used, or 250 μm dGTP and dTTP (each) and 50 μm (2.5 μCi) [α-32P]dATP and [α-32P]dCTP. SSB and each DNA polymerase were added to the reaction mixture as indicated in the legends of the figures. Reactions were preincubated 5 min at 37 °C in the presence or in the absence of SSB, with all the other components, before DNA polymerase addition. The reaction buffers were those furnished by the suppliers and contained, in addition to 30 mm NaCl brought by the primed ssDNA, the following ingredients: (i) for pol I, pol I KF, and T7 pol: 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmDTT, 50 μg/ml BSA, 10% glycerol; (ii) for Sequenase: 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol; (iii) for pol II and pol II exo−: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 8 mmMgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 40 μg/ml BSA, 10% glycerol; (iv) for pol III HE: 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mmDTT, 2 mm ATP, 100 μg/ml BSA, 5–30 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol; (v) for T4 pol: 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 50 μg/ml BSA, 10% glycerol; and (vi) for Φ29 pol and Φ29 pol exo−: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml BSA, 10% glycerol. After 15 min at 37 °C, the synthesis was arrested by the addition of 25 mm EDTA and 500 μg/ml proteinase K, and the mixture was further incubated for 15 min at 55 °C. When the reaction products were cleaved with restriction enzymes, proteinase K was inactivated by addition of 2 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (ICN Biomedicals) and incubation for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction mixture was then dialyzed on micromembrane (Millipore VS, 0.025 μm for 20 min) before cleavage. Reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis through 0.8% agarose gels (Seakem GTG or Ultrapure Life Technologies, Inc.) under native conditions, run in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) at 2 V/cm for 16 h or through 6% acrylamide-urea sequencing gels (National Diagnostics) run in TBE buffer (90 mmTris borate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) at 60 watts/65 mA for 2–3 h. DNA was visualized by direct exposure of the dried gels either to x-ray films or to Storage Phosphor Screens and analyzed on a PhosphorImager or a STORM (Molecular Dynamics). M13mp18 ssDNA and primer 1212 were from New England Biolabs. Primer 37 (5′-CTA ATC AGG AGA ATT CGT AAT CAT GGT CAT-3′) was synthesized by Genosis. Primer 1212 was labeled and annealed using a 2-fold molar excess at positions 6326–6310 of M13mp18. Primer 37 was annealed using a 2-fold molar excess at positions 6235–6216 (only 20 bases from the 3′ end are complementary to the template, whereas 10 bases form a 5′ tail). Primer extension reactions were performed as described above, except that they contained 125 ng of doubly primed single-stranded M13mp18 in 50 μl. Aliquots of 5 μl were withdrawn at the times indicated and processed as described above before loading on a 6% acrylamide-urea sequencing gel, run at 60 watts for 90 min. To test the ability of different polymerases to undergo slippage, we carried out primer extension reactions with radiolabeled nucleotides on a single-stranded circular plasmid DNA. This template carries two 27-bp direct repeats that flank a pair of 300-bp inverted repeats (Fig.1 A, left). E. coli pol III HE mainly generates one intermediate and two final products on this template (14Canceill D. Ehrlich S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6647-6652Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The intermediate, a partially replicated template, is due to the arrest of the polymerase at the hairpin formed by annealing of the two inverted repeats (Fig.1 A, center, S). One final product is a fully double-stranded molecule, termed parental (Fig. 1 A,right, P), which results from synthesis through the hairpin and therefore involves separation of duplex DNA strands. The other is a heteroduplex molecule (Fig. 1 A,right, H), composed of one recombinant and one parental DNA strand, resulting from a polymerase slippage. The recombinant strand lacks the segment flanked by the direct repeats (2 kilobases) and one of the direct repeats. The ability of the polymerase to carry out either reaction can be estimated from the proportion of these products. Two templates used in this work, pHP727FXb and pHP727FXc, differ slightly by the sequence at the base of the palindrome (Fig. 1 B, FXb and FXc, respectively). Essentially identical results were obtained with both, and for simplicity, only those obtained with the second are shown throughout the manuscript. The differences observed with pol II and T4 pol are presented in the last section under “Results.” To determine the slippage efficiency the reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis on agarose gel and revealed by autoradiography. An example of such analysis, carried out with pol III HE, is shown on Fig. 2 (lanes 9–12). The two products, parental (P) and heteroduplex (H) display slow and intermediate migration on agarose gels, whereas the incompletely replicated molecules (S) migrate fast. Detailed characterization of the molecules obtained with pol III HE by digestion with restriction enzymes, followed by electrophoresis on sequencing gel, autoradiography, and determination of the size of specific restriction fragments were reported previously (14Canceill D. Ehrlich S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6647-6652Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It was carried out for the polymerases studied here in many experiments but is not presented for simplicity. Slippage ability of two E. coli DNA polymerases, pol I and pol II, was compared with that of the previously studied pol III HE. Pol I generated both parental and heteroduplex molecules (Fig. 2, lanes 1–4). We deduce that this polymerase can slip under the conditions used. The proportion of the heteroduplex varied inversely with pol I concentration. A similar phenomenon was previously observed with pol III HE (14Canceill D. Ehrlich S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6647-6652Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and was confirmed here (Fig. 2, lanes 9–12). Somewhat unexpectedly, pol I generated three heteroduplex products (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4), formed by slippage at different short repeats, present either at the bottom of the hairpin (Fig. 1 B) or within it, as deduced from the restriction analysis and electrophoresis on sequencing gels (not shown). Pol I KF was also tested and found to be indistinguishable from pol I (not shown). Pol II slipped more efficiently than the other two polymerases (Fig. 2, lanes 5–8), forming predominantly heteroduplex molecules under all tested conditions. We tested the slippage ability of three different phage DNA polymerases: T7 pol (which is phylogenetically related to pol I) and T4 pol and Φ29 pol (both related to pol II). T4 pol generated large amounts of heteroduplex molecules and no parental molecules, even at the highest concentrations (Fig. 2, lanes 13–16) and thus resembled pol II. T7 pol resembled pol I and pol III, forming a higher proportion of heteroduplex at low enzyme concentrations (Fig. 2, lanes 17–20). In contrast, Φ29 pol did not form heteroduplex molecules under any condition; instead, it synthesized mainly slowly migrating high molecular weight molecules (Fig. 2, lanes 21–23). These are presumably due to rolling circle replication, which implies that after completion of one round of replication, the newly synthesized strand is displaced and the synthesis continued. Φ29 pol is known to possess a very potent strand displacement activity (28Blanco L. Bernad A. Lazaro J.M. Martin G. Garmendia C. Salas M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8935-8940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The absence of recombinant heteroduplex was verified by analyzing the restricted DNA samples on a sequencing gel, a method of detection that is more sensitive than the agarose gel electrophoresis (not shown). We conclude from these results that all polymerases but one, endowed with an exceptionally high strand displacement activity, can slip. Synthesis of parental molecules requires opening of the duplex DNA formed by the annealing of the palindrome present on the single-stranded templates (Fig. 1). Such opening should be promoted by the strand displacement activity that a polymerase may have. As a consequence, high strand displacement activity should interfere with slippage, as observed for Φ29 pol, above. It is known that the strand displacement activity of certain exo− mutants DNA polymerases is modified, probably because the same structural domain of the polymerase is required for both activities. Such exo−mutants affected in strand displacement activity were described for T7 pol (32Engler M.J. Lechner R.L. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11165-11173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Lechner R.L. Engler M.J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol.

To test the putative negative correlation between strand displacement activity and slippage efficiency, we used two such mutants: (i) T7 pol exo−(SequenaseTM, version 2, a genetically engineered protein which misses 28 amino acids; Ref. 37Tabor S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6447-6458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that has lost the proofreading activity and has acquired a strand displacement activity, (ii) Φ29 pol exo− (carrying a point mutation) that has lost proofreading activity and has a reduced strand displacement activity (∼10% of the wild type enzyme; Refs. 34Soengas M.S.

In addition, we tested two exo− mutants for which no data concerning their strand displacement activity were previously reported: (i) pol I KF exo− that has lost both the 5′ → 3′ (nick translation) and the 3′ → 5′ (proofreading) exonuclease activities (38Derbyshire V. Freemont P.S. Sanderson M.R. Beese L. Friedman J.M. Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Science. 1988; 240: 199-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) and (ii) pol II exo− that has lost the proofreading activity (39Cai H., Yu, H. McEntee K. Kunkel T.A. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15327-15335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The acquisition of a strand displacement activity by T7 pol exo− rendered the polymerase unable to slip (Fig.3 A, lanes 4–6). This supports the hypothesis that the opening of the duplex interferes with slippage. In contrast, partial loss of the strand displacement activity of Φ29 pol exo− did not promote slippage (Fig.3 B, lanes 4–6). This activity is clearly lower in the mutant than in the wild type Φ29 pol, because it mainly produced parental molecules rather than high molecular weight material (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1–3). However, it appears strong enough to efficiently open the duplex formed by the palindrome. It was reported that the strand displacement activity can be reduced further by decreasing the reaction temperature (to 10 °C) or by increasing the salt concentration (40Soengas M.S. Gutierrez C. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, even under such conditions no slippage was detected (not shown). The pol I KF exo− mutant enzyme was essentially indistinguishable from pol I and pol I KF under all conditions tested (not shown). In contrast, pol II exo− has become able to synthesize parental molecules to the detriment of the recombinant heteroduplex (Fig. 3 C, compare lanes 1 and2 to lanes 5 and 6). It is possible that the mutation in pol I does not affect the strand displacement activity, whereas the mutation in pol II endows the enzyme with some strand displacement activity and thus enables it to open the duplex portion of the template. Study of pol III HE revealed that E. coli SSB could stimulate replication slippage (14Canceill D. Ehrlich S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6647-6652Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the effect of SSB on slippage of other DNA polymerases. The amounts of SSB ranged from one-tenth to 10 times that required to cover all the single-stranded DNA present in the assay. Two effects of E. coli SSB were observed, one on slippage and another on overall DNA synthesis. The slippage of pol I was inhibited by SSB, because almost no heteroduplex molecules were detected at high SSB concentrations (Fig.4). In parallel, the amount of parental size molecules decreased, and the molecules migrating more slowly appeared, suggesting that the strand displacement activity of pol I was stimulated by SSB. The overall synthesis was not affected greatly, irrespective of the pol I concentration. Analogous results were obtained with pol I KF (not shown). A similar inhibitory effect of SSB on slippage of T7 pol was observed (Fig.5, lanes 1–4, 7, and 8). In contrast to pol I, SSB stimulated overall synthesis by T7 pol, particularly at low polymerase concentrations (Fig. 5, lanes 5–8 and 9–12).Figure 5Effect of E. coli SSB on synthesis and slippage promoted by T7 pol. The primer extension reactions were carried out as described in the legend to Fig. 2 on 25 ng of FXc template but with three different amounts of T7 pol, as indicated above the lanes and increasing amounts of SSB ranging from 0, 0.1, 1, to 10 times the saturating amount. Lanes 1, 5, and 9, no SSB. Lanes 2,6, and 10, 7.5 ng of SSB. Lanes 3,7, and 11, 75 ng of SSB. Lanes 4,8, and 12, 750 ng of SSB.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Results with pol II were markedly different. The slippage was affected little by SSB, because the heteroduplex molecules were the major product whenever the synthesis was efficient enough (bands migrating faster than the heteroduplex, detected when the synthesis was inefficient, are presumably due to polymerase pausing before completion of replication; Fig. 6, lanes 6, 11, and 12).

It is the most potent natural chemokine inhibitor of M-tropic HIV-1 infection (9Cocchi F. deVico A.L. Garzino-Demo A. Ayra S.K. Gallo R.C. Lusso P. Science. 1995; 270: 1811-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (2644) Google Scholar), but at high concentration can also act as a stimulator, enhancing viral infection (10Gordon C.J.

Numerous elements of the RANTES signaling cascade have been characterized, but the whole process remains poorly understood (12Ward S.G. Bacon K.B. Westwick J. Immunity. 1998; 9: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). RANTES has been shown to act via two different signal transduction pathways in T cells (13Bacon K.B. Premack B.A. Gardner P. Schall T.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1727-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The high affinity Gi-type G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathway acts at relatively low concentrations of RANTES (≤50 nm) and mediates chemotaxis, transient calcium mobilization, and suppression of HIV infection, although the last may require only receptor binding and not signaling. The low affinity signaling pathway acts via protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and is observed only at higher concentrations of RANTES (≥1 μm). RANTES-induced stimulation of the low affinity PTK pathway leads to T cell activation, including proliferation of T cells, induction of interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression, homotypic aggregation and increases in expression of cell surface molecules such as the IL-2 receptor (CD25), CD49, CD28, CD11b, and CD11c (13Bacon K.B. Premack B.A. Gardner P. Schall T.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1727-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 14Bacon K.B. Szabo M.C. Yssel H. Bolen J.B. Schall T.J. J. Exp.

Immunol. 1997; 27: 1061-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Both the Gi-type GPCR- and PTK-mediated responses to RANTES stimulation can be studied independently by assessing calcium mobilization in THP-1 cells, which respond only via the Gi-type GPCR signaling pathway, or in CD3+ Jurkat cells, which respond only via the PTK pathway (16Dairaghi D.J. Soo K.S. Oldham E.R. Premack B.A. Kitamura T. Bacon K.B. Schall T.J. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 426-433PubMed Google Scholar). These studies lead us to conclude that at high concentration, RANTES is a potent immune modulator, distinct from antigen, which activates T cells, and may be an important factor in immune pathologies lacking obvious antigenic stimulation. There is interest in potential clinical uses for chemokines, but the proinflammatory nature of RANTES may inhibit its clinical evaluation. A single intradermal injection of RANTES into dog skin resulted in a dose-dependent, eosinophil- and macrophage-rich inflammatory lesion within 4 h, leading to full dermal thickening after 24 h, indicative of significant proinflammatory activity (3Meurer R. Van Riper G. Feeney W. Cunningham P. Hora Jr., D. Springer M.S. MacIntyre D.E. Rosen H. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1913-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In a clinical setting, such inflammatory responses could amount to serious undesirable side effects. There is a need, therefore, for noninflammatory RANTES analogues, and particularly those that retain the native agonist properties, to enable preclinical evaluation. MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and RANTES are chemokines that share the unusual tendency to self-associate, forming high molecular weight aggregates in a concentration-dependent manner. It is our belief that their aggregation must be fully characterized and its in vivo relevance determined if the immunomodulatory properties of these chemokines are to be fully understood. Systematic mutagenesis has identified key residues in MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and RANTES that are critical for aggregation and has enabled the production of fully active disaggregated proteins (11Czaplewski L.G. McKeating J. Craven C.J. Higgins L.D. Appay V. Brown A. Dudgeon T. Howard L.A. Meyers T. Owen J. Palan S.R. Tan P. Wilson G. Woods N.R. Heyworth C.M. Lord B.I. Brotherton D. Christison R. Craig S.

All of the receptor binding, Gi-type GPCR-mediated signal transduction and chemotactic activities associated with the aggregating chemokines were maintained in the disaggregated mutants. However, a significant biological difference between aggregating and nonaggregating forms of RANTES was identified. High concentrations of aggregating RANTES could stimulatein vitro HIV-1 infection, but disaggregated RANTES variants were always HIV-1 suppressive (11Czaplewski L.G. McKeating J. Craven C.J. Higgins L.D. Appay V. Brown A. Dudgeon T. Howard L.A. Meyers T. Owen J. Palan S.R. Tan P. Wilson G. Woods N.R. Heyworth C.M. Lord B.I. Brotherton D. Christison R. Craig S. Cribbes S. Edwards R.M.

This observation led us to investigate whether there were other activities associated with RANTES aggregation. The RANTES concentration dependence of T cell activation (13Bacon K.B.

Here we show that RANTES aggregation is indeed responsible for its T cell proinflammatory properties and extend this observation to human monocytes and neutrophils. Furthermore, we also show that erythrocytes inhibit cellular activation by RANTES, and we have identified MIP-1α and MIP-1β and disaggregated RANTES as potent antagonists of RANTES-induced cellular activation. Synthetic chemokine gene construction, generation of mutants, yeast expression of chemokine protein, and its purification have been described (11Czaplewski L.G. McKeating J. Craven C.J. Higgins L.D.

Briefly, they were expressed inSaccharomyces cerevisiae and were purified after secretion from the culture supernatant. Ion-exchange and reverse-phase HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) produced proteins >95% purity with correct molecular mass by mass spectrometry. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interleukin (IL)-8, and stromal-derived factor-1 were purchased from R&D Systems (Abingdon, United Kingdom). The human monocytic THP-1 and T cell-like CD3+ Jurkat cell-lines were obtained from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures. They were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium, 2 mm glutamine, 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum at 37 °C in 95%/5% air/CO2. Blood was obtained from healthy volunteers by venepuncture. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were purified from heparin-anticoagulated blood by Ficoll-Hypaque (Sigma) separation. Primary human T cells were expanded from human PBMCs (106/ml) in RPMI 1640 medium, 2 mm glutamine, 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum by phytohemagglutinin (PHA) (Sigma; 5 μg/ml) and lymphocult-T-HP (1% (v/v), Biotest) stimulation. After 2 days, the cells were washed, resuspended at 105/ml in the same medium without PHA, and kept in culture for a few weeks. Human neutrophils were isolated from EDTA-anticoagulated blood by dextran (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) sedimentation, Ficoll-Hypaque separation, and hypotonic lysis of erythrocytes. Flow cytometry was used to assess purity and activation status of the cells prior to use. Neutrophils were >96% and cultured human T cells were >90% CD3+ (50% CD4+, 50% CD8+) pure cell populations. Erythrocytes were purified by dextran sedimentation and Ficoll-Hypaque separation. After extensive washing in PBS, the erythrocytes were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium at 109 cells/ml. This assay was performed as described in Czaplewski et al. (11Czaplewski L.G. McKeating J. Craven C.J. Higgins L.D. Appay V. Brown A. Dudgeon T. Howard L.A. Meyers T. Owen J. Palan S.R. Tan P.

Briefly, cells (2 × 106/ml) in growth medium were incubated with Fura-2/AM (1 μm) for 45 min and washed and resuspended in Tyrodes buffer at 2 × 106 cells/ml. A Perkin-Elmer LS-50B fluorometer was used to measure Fura-2 fluorescence emission intensity. Fura-2-loaded cells (2 ml, 2 × 106 cells/ml) were transferred to a 4.5-ml UV grade cuvette (Fisons); CaCl2was added to 1 mm final concentration and left to equilibrate for 2 min. The samples were excited at 340 nm with a 10-nm bandwidth, and the emission was continuously recorded at 500 nm with a 5-nm bandwidth. Chemokines were added (20 μl, 100× final concentration), and the increase in intracellular calcium were noted. To achieve the very high chemokine concentrations used in some experiments, 1 ml of chemokine (final concentration, 2× in Tyrodes buffer) was added to 1 ml of cells at 4 × 106/ml. The effect of pertussis toxin (Calbiochem) was assessed by preincubation (1 μg/ml) for 30 min prior to assay. Cell migration was evaluated according to Czaplewski et al. (11Czaplewski L.G. McKeating J. Craven C.J. Higgins L.D. Appay V. Brown A. Dudgeon T. Howard L.A. Meyers T. Owen J. Palan S.R. Tan P. Wilson G. Woods N.R. Heyworth C.M. Lord B.I. Brotherton D. Christison R. Craig S.

Counts from two high powered fields (× 400 magnification) per assay point in each experiment were averaged. Jurkat cells in fetal calf serum-free RPMI 1640 were mixed with chemokines or PHA in 96-well round bottomed plates (100 μl, 2.5 × 104 cells/well). They were incubated for 40 h at 37 °C. The cells were then radiolabeled with [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/well, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 4 h. Cells were harvested and counted. The results are expressed as the mean cpm ± S.E. Cells (0.5 ml 106/ml) in fetal calf serum-free RPMI 1640 medium were incubated with chemokines, PHA (Sigma), or IL-8 or left untreated (addition of PBS as a control) and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. The cells were harvested, washed in PBS, and incubated with appropriate monoclonal antibodies for 20 min at room temperature. Monoclonal antibodies used in this study were anti-human CD3 (PerCP), CD4 (FITC), CD8 (PE), CD69 (FITC or PE), CD11b (Mac-1-PE), CD11c (gp-150, 95-PE), and CD14 (PE) from Becton Dickinson. Cells were washed and analyzed by flow cytometry on a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur. When whole blood was used, it was diluted with an equal volume of RPMI 1640 medium and used as above. Erythrocytes were lysed using a Coulter Q-prep (EPICS, Immunology). The effect of erythrocyte addition was assessed by mixing purified erythrocytes (109/ml) with purified neutrophils (106/ml) or Jurkat cells (106/ml) to approximate blood cell concentration. After incubation with chemokines, the cell mixtures were harvested, and the cells were stained with antibodies as described above. Erythrocytes were lysed as above prior to fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. The concentration-dependent self-association of RANTES, RANTES E26A, RANTES E66S, and RANTES E26A/E66S was analyzed by sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation at 0.1 and 0.5 mg/ml (TableI). Substitution of acidic residues at position 26 or 66 disaggregated RANTES resulting in the generation of protein solutions with weight average molecular weights consistent with tetramers and dimers respectively. Substitutions at both of these positions did not further disaggregate the variants. The self-association of the variants was insensitive to protein concentration over the range of concentrations suitable for analytical ultracentrifugation analysis. Use of RANTES, RANTES E26S, and RANTES E66S in experiments allows the biology of aggregating RANTES, “tetrameric” RANTES, and “dimeric” RANTES to be compared. It must be appreciated that at higher protein concentrations (up to 4 mg/ml), even the disaggregated variants will self-associate, although their tendency to do so is greatly reduced. We have focused on the comparison of RANTES and RANTES E66S.Table IEffects of amino acid substitution on RANTES aggregationChemokineAUCaAUC, analytical ultracentrifugation.

We have confirmed the Gi-type GPCR potency of RANTES E66S using THP-1 cells that naturally express RANTES receptors (Fig.1 A).

The results obtained with the supraoptimal 1 μm dose of chemokine are presented to enable direct comparison at that dose with the results obtained using Jurkat cells (Fig. 2 A). To ensure that RANTES E66S retained potency through the Gi-type GPCR-mediated signal transduction pathway, the chemoattractant activities of RANTES and RANTES E66S for mononuclear cells were evaluated and were comparable (Fig. 1 B).Figure 2Activities of RANTES and disaggregated RANTES variants through the PTK pathway.

Soo K.S. Oldham E.R. Premack B.A. Kitamura T. Bacon K.B. Schall T.J. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 426-433PubMed Google Scholar). Low concentrations of RANTES (<100 nm) failed to induce a response. High concentrations of RANTES (1 μm) were required to induce the prolonged calcium mobilization response typical of PTK signaling Fig.2 A). This response was comparable to that obtained by treatment with the T cell mitogen PHA (data not shown). Surprisingly, the disaggregated RANTES variant E66S (1 μm) was inactive in this assay (Fig. 2 A). The longevity of calcium mobilization induced by RANTES (1 μm) in Jurkat cells is clearly different from that obtained in THP-1 cells (Fig.1 A). The inability of disaggregated RANTES to activate the PTK pathway was confirmed on primary human T cells, which possess both the Gi-type GPCR and PTK signal transduction pathways (13Bacon K.B. Premack B.A. Gardner P. Schall T.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1727-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B). RANTES (1 μm) caused a large prolonged pertussis toxin (PTX)-insensitive calcium mobilization in T cells typical of the PTK response. The delayed calcium mobilization observed after PTX treatment may reflect inhibition of the Gi-type GPCR-mediated response (13Bacon K.B. Premack B.A. Gardner P. Schall T.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1727-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Disaggregated RANTES E66S (1 μm) did not stimulate the PTK pathway, but a smaller, pertussis toxin-sensitive, transient calcium mobilization, typical of the Gi-type GPCR response, was observed. As pertussis toxin is a specific inhibitor of the Gi-type GPCR pathway, we conclude that disaggregated RANTES E66S signals only, or predominantly, via this pathway, whereas wild-type aggregated RANTES signals via both the PTK and Gi-type GPCR pathways. A substantial delay between chemokine addition and the stimulation of calcium mobilization via the Gi-type GPCR pathway in T cells compared with THP-1 cells was noted. It is possible that an element of the signal transduction pathway in T cells was impaired during T cell purification. We then explored the RANTES concentration and aggregation dependence of PTK activation, using Jurkat cells (Fig.2 C). Clearly, 1 μm RANTES is at the threshold of PTK activation. A 10-fold increase in RANTES concentration (to 10 μm) caused a 45-fold increase in calcium mobilization. RANTES E26A, which is tetrameric, was less potent than wild-type RANTES in this assay, and the fully disaggregated dimeric RANTES variants E66S and E26A/E66S were essentially inactive even at 10 μm. Neither MIP-1α nor MIP-1β (10 μm) induced calcium mobilization responses (data not shown). The correlation between self-association and activity in this assay implies that RANTES aggregation is directly responsible for activation of the PTKs. At a very high concentration (500 μm), RANTES E66S induced a calcium flux, reaching the same level, although delayed, as RANTES (2.5 μm)-induced flux (Fig. 2 D). We conclude that RANTES E66S does aggregate at very high concentration and that it is approximately 200-fold less potent an activator of the protein tyrosine kinase pathway than RANTES. A consequence of RANTES-induced activation of the tyrosine kinase pathway in Jurkat cells, in the absence of fetal calf serum, was a reduction in cellular proliferation, which followed a similar dose-response to calcium mobilization (Fig. 2 E). RANTES treatment elevated expression of cell surface annexin V, indicating that the cells were apoptotic (data not shown), undergoing an activation-induced cell death due to the lack of growth costimulatory signal normally present in the serum. PHA-induced activation also inhibited proliferation by a similar mechanism. Jurkat cells treated with RANTES E66S continued to proliferate, confirming the striking difference between aggregating and disaggregated RANTES. T cell activation induced by RANTES or disaggregated RANTES was assessed using the early activation marker CD69. We also looked at the expression of the adhesion molecules CD11b and CD11c, members of the integrin family. Unlike wild-type RANTES, RANTES E66S was unable to induce any marker up-regulation on cultured human (50% CD4+/50% CD8+) T cells (Fig. 3) and therefore did not activate the T cells. The effect of RANTES was concentration-dependent, and it was necessary to use a higher concentration of RANTES (5 μm) to reproducibly observe activation in the cultured human T cells. RANTES-mediated stimulation of CD69, CD11b, and CD11c expression was insensitive to pertussis toxin (data not shown). Similar results were obtained using Jurkat cells and T cells fluorescence-activated cell sorter-gated from freshly purified PBMCs (data not shown). RANTES-induced homotypic adhesion of human T cells described by Bacon et al. (14Bacon K.B. Szabo M.C. Yssel H. Bolen J.B. Schall T.J. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 873-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) was not observed in the presence of RANTES E66S (not shown). The integrin CD11b can be used as a cell surface marker of neutrophil activation. Although RANTES effects on neutrophils have seldom been described in literature, Conklynet al. (17Conklyn M.J. Neote K. Showell H.J. Cytokine. 1996; 8: 762-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) showed that RANTES could act on neutrophils in EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood, elevating CD11b expression in a concentration-dependent manner. We reproduced these results and showed that neutrophils in whole blood responded to both RANTES and RANTES E66S with relatively modest increases in CD11b expression compared with that obtained by treatment with IL-8 (Fig.4 A). However, on purified neutrophils, the response was quite different with substantial elevation of CD11b at 5 μm RANTES and no stimulation by 5 μm RANTES E66S (Fig. 4 B). This increase in CD11b expression on purified neutrophils was not inhibited by pertussis toxin, but the effects of IL-8 (which acts through the Gi-type GPCR pathway) were pertussis toxin-sensitive (data not shown). These data led to the conclusion that two signaling pathways were involved in the response. As in T cells, RANTES appears to act on neutrophils via two independent mechanisms: an aggregation-independent mechanism (Gi-type GPCR-mediated because RANTES E66S is active) that acts at a relatively low concentration to modestly elevate CD11b expression, and an aggregation-dependent mechanism (non-Gi-type GPCR or non-GPCR-linked) that is observed only on purified neutrophils. We assume that a RANTES-induced GPCR response was not observed in purified neutrophils and that the IL-8-induced response decreased compared with whole blood assay, because this pathway may have been affected by cell purification. We have also demonstrated the presence of the aggregation-dependent RANTES signaling pathway in monocytes using cell surface expression of CD69 to estimate cellular activation by RANTES (5 μm) and RANTES E66S (5 μm) (Fig. 4 C). Lower concentrations of chemokine did not induce significant up-regulation of CD69 on monocytes (not shown). Because the RANTES Gi-type GPCR signaling pathway has already been described in monocytes (1Schall T.J. Cytokine. 1991; 3: 165-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar), this observation implies that dual signaling pathways induced by RANTES exists in these cells as well as in T cells and neutrophils. The aggregation-dependent RANTES signaling pathway was observed in purified neutrophils but not neutrophils in whole blood (Fig. 4,A and B). Here, we show that purified T cells respond to aggregated RANTES (Fig. 3), but we have been unable to demons"

The most direct effect of adhesion is on morphogenesis, i.e. the assembly of the individual cells into highly ordered tissues and organs through cell-cell junctions (1Takeichi M. Curr. Opin.

There are two types of cell-cell junctions: desmosomes and adherens junctions (4Takeichi M. Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2974) Google Scholar, 5Cowin P. Burke B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Desmosomes have two transmembrane components, desmoglein and desmocollin, which are members of the cadherin family (6Buxton R.S.

The cytoplasmic region of cadherin forms a complex with three proteins, α-, β-, and γ-catenins (4Takeichi M. Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2974) Google Scholar,12Kemler R. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 317-321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar); γ-catenin is identical to plakoglobin (13Peifer M. McCrea P.D. Green K.J. Wieschaus E. Gumbiner B.M. J.

The cytoplasmic components of adherens junctions and desmosomes are necessary for linking to actin filaments and intermediate filaments, respectively (4Takeichi M.

Turck C.W. Gumbiner B. Science. 1991; 254: 1359-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). It has been shown that β-catenin and plakoglobin bind directly to cadherin and α-catenin (16Aberle H. Butz S. Stappert J. Weissig H. Kemler R. Hoschuetzky H. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3655-3663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Hülsken J. Birchmeier W. Behrens J. J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 629-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The N-terminal regions of β-catenin and plakoglobin contain their α-catenin-binding sites. The central region, which has multiple copies of the armadillo motif, is involved in the association with cadherin, and in the case of plakoglobin, with desmoglein and desmocollin. Thus, plakoglobin is a common plaque component of both types of cell-cell junctions and is essential for sorting out of desmosomes and adherens junctions. Disruption of plakoglobin in mice causes embryonic death at embryonic days 12–16 because of severe defects in heart structure, resulting in ventricle burst and blood flooding the pericardium (20Bierkamp C. McLaughlin K.J. Schwarz H. Huber O. Kemler R. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 780-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 21Ruiz P. Brinkmann V. Ledermann B. Behrend M. Grund C. Thalhammer C. Vogel F.

Larue L. Ohsugi M. Fedorov L. Herrenknecht K. Kemler R. Development. 1995; 121: 3529-3537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, β-catenin and plakoglobin do not appear to compensate for each other in embryos.In addition to their roles in cell-cell adhesion, β-catenin and plakoglobin are components in the Wnt signaling pathway (19Ben-Ze'ev A. Geiger B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 629-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 23Miller J.R. Moon R.T.

Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In the fly, the Wnt-1 homolog, wingless, is required for the patterning of each segment, and for pattern formation and cell proliferation in imaginal discs (27Peifer M. Rauskolb C. Williams M. Riggleman B. Wieschaus E. Development. 1991; 111: 1029-1043PubMed Google Scholar). Multiple components of the wingless signaling pathway have been identified and characterized genetically (23Miller J.R. Moon R.T.

Vertebrate homologs of these genes have also been identified (23Miller J.R. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 24Nusse R.

Armadillo is homologous to both β-catenin and plakoglobin. Wingless expression inDrosophila embryos promotes the posttranslational accumulation of armadillo (28Peifer M. Pai L.M. Casey M. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 543-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Rapid accumulation and stabilization of armadillo have also been demonstrated in cultured Drosophilacells incubated with soluble wingless (29van Leeuwen F. Samos C.H. Nusse R. Nature. 1994; 368: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Similarly, in mammalian cells, Wnt-1 expression leads to increasing steady state level of β-catenin and plakoglobin (30Bradley R.S. Cowin P. Brown A.M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1857-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 31Hinck L. Nelson W.J. Papkoff J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 32Papkoff J.

In Xenopus laevis, overexpression of β-catenin or plakoglobin leads to ectopic axis formation, and this effect is also obtained with overexpression ofXenopus Wnt (33Sokol S. Christian J.L. Moon R.T. Melton D.A. Cell. 1991; 67: 741-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 34Funayama N. Fagotto F. McCrea P. Gumbiner B.M. J.

These results suggest that β-catenin and plakoglobin may have similar functions in the Wnt signaling pathway.Recent biochemical studies in mammals have revealed the molecular mechanism by which Wnt regulates the stabilization of β-catenin (23Miller J.R. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 24Nusse R. Cell. 1997; 89: 321-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 25Dale T.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). In the absence of Wnt, GSK-3β,1 a shaggy homolog, phosphorylates β-catenin, and the phosphorylated β-catenin is ubiquitinated, resulting in the degradation of β-catenin by proteasomes (36Munemitsu S. Albert I. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4088-4094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Yost C. Torres M. Miller J.R. Huang E. Kimelman D. Moon R.T.

Wnt binds to its receptor Frizzled, a Dfrizzled2 homolog, and inactivates GSK-3β, probably through Dvl, a dishevelled homolog, although the mechanism is not clear (39Cook D. Fry M.J. Hughes K. Sumathipala R. Woodgett J.R. Dale T.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4526-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). This leads to the stabilization of β-catenin, and accumulated β-catenin translocates into the nucleus where it binds to and activates the transcriptional factor Tcf/Lef, a pangolin homolog (40Behrens J. von Kries J.P.

Thus, Axin functions as a scaffold protein and regulates the stability of β-catenin.Although it has been shown that the expression of Wnt-1 also stabilizes plakoglobin in several cell lines (30Bradley R.S.

These results prompted us to examine whether Axin is involved in the regulation of the stability of plakoglobin. Here we demonstrate that Axin directly binds to plakoglobin and enhances GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation of plakoglobin. Further, we show that Axin degrades plakoglobin. These results suggest that Axin regulates the stability of plakoglobin via a mechanism like that by which Wnt regulates β-catenin.DISCUSSIONRegulation of the expression of β-catenin and plakoglobin is important in morphogenetic events during embryonic development (34Funayama N.

Although the molecular mechanism by which the stability of β-catenin is regulated has become clear, that for regulation of plakoglobin is not fully understood. In this study, we have addressed the regulation of the cellular plakoglobin level. We have demonstrated for the first time that Axin directly binds to plakoglobin, that it enhances GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation of plakoglobin, and that it down-regulates plakoglobin. Taken together with the observations that Axin enhances GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation of β-catenin, resulting in the degradation of β-catenin (45Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar, 49Hart M.J. de los Santos R. Albert I.N. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Curr.

Chem. 1998; 273: 10823-10826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), these findings suggest that Axin regulates the stability of both β-catenin and plakoglobin.The phosphorylation of serine/threonine residues 29–45 of β-catenin is necessary for its degradation, and deletion of this region results in the stabilization of β-catenin (23Miller J.R. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 36Munemitsu S. Albert I. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Mol. Cell.

In Xenopusembryos, plakoglobin behaves like β-catenin in that deletion of the 17 amino acids including the possible phosphorylation site for GSK-3β from the N terminus of plakoglobin leads to an increase in the stability of the protein (59Rubenstein A. Merriam J. Klymkowsky M.W. Dev. Genet. 1997; 20: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). GSK-3β and β-catenin directly bind to separate, adjacent sites on Axin. Because β-catenin inhibits the binding of plakoglobin to Axin, β-catenin and plakoglobin may share the same binding site on Axin. Therefore, it is possible that Axin enhances GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation of plakoglobin by simultaneously binding to GSK-3β and plakoglobin. It has been shown that the phosphorylation of β-catenin by GSK-3β in the presence of Axin is required for the complex formation with βTrCP/FWD, resulting in β-catenin being ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome pathway (50Kitagawa M. Hatakeyama S. Shirane M. Matsumoto M. Ishida N. Hattori K. Nakamichi I. Kikuchi A. Nakayama K.-I. Nakayama K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2401-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination of plakoglobin is also observed in A431 cells treated with a proteasome inhibitor (38Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2135) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results imply that the phosphorylation of plakoglobin by GSK-3β in the Axin complex could result in its degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.We have found that the armadillo repeats 2–7 of plakoglobin bind to Axin. This region of plakoglobin is also necessary to interact with the cytoplasmic tails of desmocollin, desmoglein, and cadherin (11Wahl J.K. Sacco P.A. McGranahan-Sadler T.M. Sauppé L.M. Wheelock M.J.

Expression of either desmoglein or desmocollin in mouse L cells decreases the rate of plakoglobin degradation (7Kowalczyk A.P. Palka H.L. Luu H.H. Nilles L.A. Anderson J.E. Wheelock M.J. Green K.J.

J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1697-1704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the binding region of β-catenin to Axin overlaps with that to E-cadherin (17Hülsken J. Birchmeier W. Behrens J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 2061-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 45Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the bindings of plakoglobin and β-catenin to desmoglein and desmocollin, and E-cadherin, respectively, rescue plakoglobin and β-catenin from the degradation pathway. It has been shown that plakoglobin interacts with desmoglein in the insoluble fraction of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and that plakoglobin is more heavily phosphorylated in the soluble fraction than in the insoluble fraction (66Pasdar M. Li Z. Chlumecky V. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 32: 258-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Therefore, plakoglobin complexed with desmoglein does not bind to Axin and may not be efficiently phosphorylated by GSK-3β and thereby be stabilized.Although plakoglobin and β-catenin are structurally homologous, whether their functions are similar is not clear. Plakoglobin, like β-catenin, directly binds to cadherin (18Sacco P.A. McGranahan T.M. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20201-20206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), α-catenin (16Aberle H. Butz S. Stappert J. Weissig H. Kemler R. Hoschuetzky H. J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1433-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Expression of Lef-1 in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells induces nuclear translocation of β-catenin but not of plakoglobin, suggesting that these proteins may differ in their specificities for transcriptional factors (68Simcha I. Shtutman M. Salomon D. Zhurinsky J. Sadot E. Geiger B. Ben-Ze'ev A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1433-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The ability of plakoglobin to activate Lef-1 is much lower than that of β-catenin (68Simcha I. Shtutman M. Salomon D. Zhurinsky J. Sadot E. Geiger B. Ben-Ze'ev A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1433-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In the Drosophila female germ line, mammalian β-catenin and plakoglobin can complement an armadillo mutation (58White P. Aberle H. Vincent J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, in embryonic signaling assays, plakoglobin has no detectable activity, whereas β-catenin has weak activity (58White P. Aberle H. Vincent J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Therefore, to definitively determine whether plakoglobin can induce transactivation, it is necessary to use β-catenin-null cells. Expression of plakoglobin in Xenopus embryos induces axis duplication (35Karnovsky A. Klymkowsky M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4522-4526Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) that was similar to that observed with β-catenin expression (34Funayama N. Fagotto F. McCrea P. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 959-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). These results suggest that plakoglobin and β-catenin have similar activities in at least axis formation in Xenopus embryos. However, it has been demonstrated that plakoglobin induces Wnt signaling in Xenopus embryos, even when it is tethered to the plasma membranes (60Merriam J.M. Rubenstein A.B. Klymkowsky M.W. Dev. Biol. 1997; 185: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), suggesting that plakoglobin could stimulate the Wnt signaling by relieving the negative action on transcriptional activation of Wnt-responsive genes or by competition and displacement of endogenous β-catenin from its association with the degradation system, followed by stabilization and nuclear translocation of β-catenin. Our present results suggest that Axin degrades both β-catenin and plakoglobin in similar manners but that plakoglobin is less sensitive to this proteolysis. Overexpression of plakoglobin may lead to the accumulation of β-catenin by blocking the proteasome degradation system.Because mutations in the phosphorylation site of β-catenin for GSK-3β have been discovered in several human tumors, including colorectal cancers and melanoma (62Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2911) Google Scholar, 63Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V.

Science. 1997; 275: 1790-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar), it is thought that β-catenin acts as an oncogene. However, plakoglobin suppresses the tumorigenesis of cells, and its expression level is often lost in tumor cells (19Ben-Ze'ev A. Geiger B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 629-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 61Simcha I. Geiger B. Yehuda-Levenberg S. Salomon D. Ben-Ze'ev A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Although the exact roles of plakoglobin in tumorigenesis are not known, possible mechanisms whereby plakoglobin affects the functions of β-catenin have been suggested. For example, the plakoglobin/Tcf activates genes that are tumor suppressive or the plakoglobin/Tcf forms an inactive complex and thus inhibits transactivation by β-catenin. In addition to these possibilities, one more possibility is conceivable based on our results. Plakoglobin competes with β-catenin for the binding to cadherin and α-catenin. β-Catenin released from the adherens complex may bind to Axin, leading to β-catenin degradation. Indeed, it has been shown that overexpression of plakoglobin results in a decrease in the level of β-catenin (69Salomon D. Sacco P.A. Roy S.G. Simcha I. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. Ben-Ze'ev A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1325-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Further studies are necessary to understand the cellular functions regulated by β-catenin and plakoglobin, of which the stability is controlled by Axin.

To delineate the mechanism(s) utilized by RB to exert its anti-proliferative activity, constitutively active RB proteins (which cannot be inactivated by phosphorylation) or p16ink4a (which prevents RB inactivation) were utilized. Both proteins inhibited the G1-S transition, whereas wild-type RB did not. We show that active RB acts to attenuate cyclin A promoter activity, and that overexpression of cyclin E reverses RB-mediated repression of the cyclin A promoter. Although cyclin A is an E2F-regulated gene, and it has been long hypothesized that RB mediates cell cycle advancement through binding to E2F and attenuating its transactivation potential, cyclin E does not reverse dominant negative E2F-mediated repression of the cyclin A promoter. Although active RB repressed both cyclin A and two other paradigm E2F-regulated promoters, only cyclin A transcription was restored upon co-expression of cyclin E. Additionally, we show that RB but not dominant negative E2F regulates the cyclin A promoter through the CCRE element. These data identify cyclin A as a downstream target of RB-mediated arrest. Consistent with this idea, ectopic expression of cyclin A reversed RB-mediated G1 arrest. The findings presented suggest a pathway wherein cyclin A is a downstream target of RB, and cyclin E functions to antagonize this aspect of RB-mediated G1-S inhibition.

The role of RB as a tumor suppressor has been well established, and it is known that RB can inhibit cellular proliferation by halting cell cycle progression (4Weinberg R.A.

At least four distinct protein-binding domains of RB have been identified and extensively characterized, including: the A/B pocket, the large A/B pocket, the C-pocket, and the N-terminal domain (5Wang J.Y. Knudsen E.S. Welch P.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1994; 64: 25-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Sidle A. Palaty C. Dirks P. Wiggan O. Kiess M. Gill R.M. Wong A.K. Hamel P.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

The large A/B pocket is the minimal growth suppressing region of RB and is required to bind the E2F family of transcription factors (10Qin X.Q. Chittenden T. Livingston D.M. Kaelin Jr., W.G.

The full-length RB protein contains 16 consensus Cdk-phosphorylation sites, and phosphorylation at specific sites inhibits the binding of RB to cellular proteins, thereby disrupting the anti-proliferative activity of RB (13Knudsen E.S.

Not surprisingly, therefore, overexpression of proteins which cause excessive or deregulated phosphorylation of RB is a common event in human tumors (2Bartek J. Bartkova J. Lukas J. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 237: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar,3Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4945) Google Scholar, 20Sherr C.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 187-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). For example, amplification of Cdk4 and/or its regulatory partner, cyclin D1, are frequently observed in human tumors. In either case, excessive Cdk4/cyclin D kinase activity results in deregulated phosphorylation and inactivation of RB. Similarly, loss of the tumor suppressor p16ink4a, which acts to attenuate Cdk4/cyclin D activity, is a common event in human tumors (2Bartek J. Bartkova J. Lukas J. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 237: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 3Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4945) Google Scholar, 20Sherr C.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 187-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Loss of p16ink4a also results in excessive phosphorylation and inactivation of RB. In normal cells, Cdk4-cyclin D complexes promote early G1 cell cycle progression upon growth factor stimulation, and it has been shown that the principle cell cycle role for Cdk4-cyclin D complexes is to phosphorylate RB (21Lukas J. Bartkova J. Rohde M. Strauss M. Bartek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2600-2611Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 22Lukas J. Parry D. Aagaard L. Mann D.J. Bartkova J. Strauss M. Peters G.

For example, Cdk4/cyclin D is dispensable for cell cycle progression in RB-deficient cells (21Lukas J. Bartkova J. Rohde M. Strauss M. Bartek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2600-2611Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In mid to late G1, Cdk2-cyclin E and Cdk2-cyclin A complexes are sequentially activated, and also phosphorylate RB (3Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4945) Google Scholar, 25Sherr C.J. Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1995; 107: 181-186PubMed Google Scholar). Cdk2 complexes clearly have other roles in addition to phosphorylating RB, since Cdk2 activity is required irrespective of RB status. Activation of all three complexes, Cdk4/cyclin D, Cdk2/cyclin E, and Cdk2/cyclin A is required for entry into S-phase (26Pagano M. Pepperkok R. Verde F. Ansorge W. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 961-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar, 27Ohtsubo M. Theodoras A.M. Schumacher J. Roberts J.M. Pagano M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2612-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar).Although it is clear that Cdk·cyclin complexes act upstream to modulate the anti-proliferative activity of RB through phosphorylation (12Mittnacht S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), the downstream effectors of RB-mediated arrest have yet to be unequivocally identified. Studies aimed directly at identifying the downstream effectors of RB have been hindered by the fact that ectopically expressed RB is rapidly phosphorylated and inactivated by endogenous Cdk-cyclin kinase activity (14Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5771-5783Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 15Knudsen E.S. Buckmaster C. Chen T.T. Feramisco J.R. Wang J.Y.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1479-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). As a result, RB acts as a poor growth inhibitor in most cell types. Most studies aimed at understanding the role of RB in growth inhibition have been carried out in the osteosarcoma cell line SAOS-2; wild-type RB is not phosphorylated in this cell line and therefore these cells are growth arrested by introduction of RB (10Qin X.Q.

A. 1991; 88: 3033-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). To circumvent the problem of RB phosphorylation and extend RB studies to non-tumorigenic cell lines, we previously designed phosphorylation site-mutated RB proteins, or PSM-RB (13Knudsen E.S.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2278-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). One such protein, PSM.7LP, acts as a constitutively active RB protein, and binds cognate cellular proteins such as E2F regardless of phosphorylation status. As such, this protein mimics unphosphorylated RB. We have previously shown that this protein acts as a potent growth inhibitor in a large number of tumorigenic (29Knudsen K.E. Weber E., Arden K.C. Cavenee W.K. Feramisco J.R. Knudsen E.S. Oncogene. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) and non-tumorigenic cell lines, and can be used as a powerful tool to study RB function and identify the downstream effectors of RB (14Knudsen E.S.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2278-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar).It has been previously hypothesized that RB inhibits cell cycle progression by binding the E2F family of transcription factors (4Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4295) Google Scholar, 30Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar). E2F is known to activate transcription of a number of genes required for S-phase, including cyclin A, cyclin E, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and thymidylate synthase (6Nevins J.R. Leone G. DeGregori J. Jakoi L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 173: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 30Dyson N.

A. 1997; 94: 7245-7250Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). RB represses E2F transcriptional activity by directly binding to E2F and recruiting histone deacetylases to E2F-specific promoters (8DePinho R.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 32Brehm A. Miska E.A. McCance D.J. Reid J.L. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1998; 391: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). The importance of this interaction was demonstrated by Sellers et al. (33Sellers W.R. Rodgers J.W. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11544-11548Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), who created a chimeric protein wherein the transrepression function of RB was provided in cis to the DNA-binding and dimerization domains of E2F. Introduction of such chimeric molecules into cells caused cell cycle arrest (33Sellers W.R. Rodgers J.W. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11544-11548Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Due to the import of the RB/E2F interaction, a model for how RB inhibits cell cycle progression has been proposed. It has been postulated that prior to Cdk/cyclin activation, RB inhibits the expression of cyclin E through the E2F-binding site in the cyclin E promoter (34Geng Y. Eaton E.N. Picaon M. Roberts J.M. Lundberg A.S. Gifford A. Sardet C. Weinberg R.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1173-1180PubMed Google Scholar, 35Ohtani K. DeGregori J. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12146-12150Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The role of RB as a regulator of cyclin E is well established, in that in Rb −/− murine embryo fibroblasts, cyclin E expression is deregulated (expressed in quiescence) (36Herrera R.E. Sah V.P. Williams B.O. Meakelea T.P. Weinberg R.A. Jacks T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2402-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 37Hurford Jr., R.K. Cobrinik D. Lee M.H. Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1447-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that ectopic expression of cyclin E overrides the G1 arrest induced by unphosphorylated RB (15Knudsen E.S. Buckmaster C. Chen T.T. Feramisco J.R. Wang J.Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2278-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 16Lukas J. Herzinger T. Hansen K. Moroni M.C. Resnitzky D. Helin K. Reed S.I. Bartek J.

These findings suggested that cyclin E is a downstream effector of RB activity.However, recent studies suggest that E2F binding is dispensable for RB-mediated growth inhibition. For example, mutants RB proteins incapable of binding to E2F still inhibit cell cycle progression in SAOS-2 cells (39Sellers W.R. Novitch B.G. Miyake S. Heith A. Otterson G.A. Kaye F.J. Lassar A.B. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 40Whitaker L.L. Su H. Baskaran R. Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4032-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that in cells arrested in G1 by unphosphorylated RB (through introduction of PSM.7LP or p16ink4a), the expression and activity of cyclin E is not down-regulated (15Knudsen E.S. Buckmaster C. Chen T.T. Feramisco J.R. Wang J.Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2278-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 19Lundberg A.S. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, 38Alevizopoulos K. Vlach J. Hennecke S. Amati B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5322-5333Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that cyclin E acts to antagonize RB function, and that downstream effectors other than cyclin E must implement the RB-mediated G1 arrest. However, these downstream effectors have yet to be identified.In this report, we sought to delineate the mechanisms through which RB inhibits cell cycle progression and determine how this function is antagonized by cyclin E. We identify cyclin A as a downstream target of RB function, as active RB inhibited cyclin A promoter activity and resulted in reduced cyclin A protein levels. As would be expected for a functional target of RB, ectopic expression of cyclin E lifted RB-mediated cyclin A promoter repression, concomitant with a restoration of cell cycle progression. This action of cyclin E occurred without RB phosphorylation. Although the cyclin A promoter is regulated by E2F, RB and dominant negative E2F repressed cyclin A promoter activity through distinct motifs, and cyclin E did not lift dominant negative E2F-mediated repression of cyclin A. Importantly, the expression of cyclin A was sufficient to overcome RB-mediated arrest. These data suggest a model wherein RB exerts its anti-proliferative activity by repressing cyclin A expression, and cyclin E acts to antagonize this function of RB.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we investigated the mechanism through which RB inhibits the G1/S transition and how this function is antagonized by cyclin E (Fig. 1). We show that introduction of constitutively active RB or p16ink4a into a non-tumorigenic cell line resulted in repression of the cyclin A promoter (Fig. 2). As would be expected for a functional target of RB, ectopic expression of cyclin E alleviated RB-mediated repression of the cyclin A promoter (Fig. 2). Although cyclin A is known to be an E2F-regulated gene, we show that RB-mediated inhibition of two other E2F-dependent promoters cannot be alleviated by cyclin E (Fig. 3), consistent with previous reports (15Knudsen E.S. Buckmaster C. Chen T.T. Feramisco J.R. Wang J.Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2278-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 16Lukas J. Herzinger T. Hansen K. Moroni M.C. Resnitzky D. Helin K. Reed S.I. Bartek J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1479-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 38Alevizopoulos K. Vlach J. Hennecke S. Amati B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5322-5333Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that RB-mediated repression of cyclin A may occur through an E2F-independent manner. To test this hypothesis, a chimeric E2F molecule was utilized wherein the transcriptional repression function of RB was provided in cis to E2F, E2F-A/B. Although E2F-A/B did inhibit cyclin A promoter activity, transcriptional repression could not be lifted by co-expression of cyclin E (Fig. 4). In addition, we demonstrated that RB-mediated repression of the cyclin A promoter requires the CCRE element, whereas dominant negative E2F-mediated repression of this promoter acts independently of the CCRE (Fig. 5). Consistent with the idea that cyclin A is a critical target of RB growth inhibitory activity, we show that active RB causes a dramatic reduction in cyclin A but not cyclin E protein levels (Fig. 6). The functional significance of cyclin A as an effector of RB-mediated cell cycle arrest was demonstrated by the fact that ectopic expression of cyclin A enabled entry into S-phase (Fig. 6). These data identify cyclin A as a downstream target of RB action, and provide a rationale for how cyclin E reverses RB-mediated cell cycle arrest.Cyclin E is known to antagonize the function of RB as a cell cycle inhibitor (15Knudsen E.S. Buckmaster C. Chen T.T. Feramisco J.R. Wang J.Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2278-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 16Lukas J. Herzinger T. Hansen K. Moroni M.C. Resnitzky D. Helin K.

Biol. 1997; 7: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Initially, it was shown by Hindset al. (48Hinds P.W. Mittnacht S. Dulic V. Arnold A. Reed S.I. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 993-1006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar) that cyclin E promotes the phosphorylation of RB in SAOS-2 cells, leading to the reversal of RB-mediated cell cycle arrest. This finding is consistent with the observation that cyclin E forms active kinase complexes with Cdk2 and phosphorylates/inactivates RB. Based on the data presented here and the work of others, cyclin E must also antagonize RB function independently of its ability to phosphorylate and inactivate RB. First, the constitutively active form of RB utilized in our and other studies cannot be inactivated by phosphorylation (14Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5771-5783Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 49Leng X. Connell-Crowley L. Goodrich D. Harper J.W. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Second, in p16ink4a-arrested cells RB is not phosphorylated, even in the presence of ectopically expressed cyclin E (19Lundberg A.S. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, 38Alevizopoulos K. Vlach J. Hennecke S. Amati B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5322-5333Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Third, if cyclin E were antagonizing RB function by phosphorylation, then cyclin E would have also disrupted E2F binding/repression, as has been previously observed for wild-type RB (14Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5771-5783Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 50Connell-Crowley L. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 65-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). As such, cyclin E must employ a mechanism besides RB phosphorylation to disrupt RB function.Although RB is known to arrest cell cycle progression and this arrest is alleviated by cyclin E, the functional targets of RB have not been defined. We and others have observed that cyclin E expression and associated kinase activity is not attenuated in RB-arrested cells (15Knudsen E.S. Buckmaster C. Chen T.T. Feramisco J.R. Wang J.Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2278-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar,16Lukas J. Herzinger T. Hansen K. Moroni M.C. Resnitzky D. Helin K. Reed S.I. Bartek J.

By contrast, reduced cyclin A expression correlates with RB-mediated cell cycle arrest (15Knudsen E.S. Buckmaster C. Chen T.T. Feramisco J.R. Wang J.Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2278-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 38Alevizopoulos K. Vlach J. Hennecke S. Amati B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5322-5333Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 42Philips A. Huet X. Plet A. Le Cam L. Viae A. Blanchard J.M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1373-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In this report we identify cyclin A as a functionally significant target in RB-mediated arrest. This conclusion is based on several critical observations. First, RB inhibits cyclin A promoter activity, leading to a down-regulation of cyclin A protein. Although it could be suggested that the reduction of cyclin A expression is not causative but is a consequence of RB-mediated arrest, this supposition is unlikely based on the additional observations that: (i) cyclin E reverses RB-mediated growth arrest and specifically restores cyclin A promoter activity without influencing other E2F-dependent promoters; and (ii) ectopic expression of cyclin A alleviates RB-mediated G1/S inhibition. Together, these data demonstrate that cyclin A is a functionally significant target of RB. These data also agree well with the known biological role of cyclin A. For example, it has been well documented that cyclin A and cyclin A-associated kinase activity is required for entry into S-phase, and the observations presented herein explain why RB-arrested cells cannot traverse the G1-S transition (26Pagano M. Pepperkok R. Verde F. Ansorge W. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 961-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar, 51Zindy F. Lamas E. Chenivesse X. Sobczak J. Wang J. Fesquet D. Henglein B. Braechot C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 1144-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Moreover, cyclin A is known to be deregulated in Rb(−/−) MEFs (36Herrera R.E. Sah V.P. Williams B.O. Meakelea T.P. Weinberg R.A. Jacks T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2402-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 37Hurford Jr., R.K. Cobrinik D. Lee M.H. Dyson N.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1373-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Since cyclin A is proposed to be an E2F-regulated gene, it has been hypothesized that deregulation of cyclin A in Rb(−/−) MEFs is a result of E2F disregulation (36Herrera R.E. Sah V.P. Williams B.O. Meakelea T.P. Weinberg R.A. Jacks T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2402-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 37Hurford Jr., R.K. Cobrinik D. Lee M.H. Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1447-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). We show that RB-mediated but not E2F-A/B-mediated inhibition of the cyclin A promoter requires an intact CCRE element. The CCRE does resemble a variant E2F site, but whether E2F actually binds this site is controversial (42Philips A. Huet X. Plet A. Le Cam L. Viae A. Blanchard J.M.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4514-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In fact, recombinant E2F capable of binding in vitro to a genuine E2F probe was shown to be incapable of binding the cyclin A CCRE under identical conditions (52Huet X. Rech J. Plet A. Viae A. Blanchard J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3789-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Instead, it has been proposed that non-E2F transcription factors which have yet to be defined bind this site and regulate the expression of cyclin A (53Liu N. Lucibello F.C. Keorner K. Wolfraim L.A. Zwicker J. Meuller R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4915-4920Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 55Zwicker J. Lucibello F.C. Jerome V. Brusselbach S. Muller R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4926-4932Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). While it has been shown that a RB family member, p107, can repress cyclin A transcription (56Zerfass K. Spitkovsky D. Schulze A. Joswig S. Henglein B. Jansen-Durr P. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2637-2642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), no evidence of direct RB binding to the cyclin A promoter has been reported. As such, whether RB acts directly or indirectly to inhibit cyclin A promoter activity has yet to be established; however, this function of RB has a significant impact on cell cycle progression. Several scenarios can be envisioned to explain how cyclin E can restore cyclin A expression. For example, it has been shown that cyclin E can directly bind the cyclin A promoter and activate transcription (57Zerfass-Thome K. Schulze A. Zwerschke W. Vogt B. Helin K. Bartek J. Henglein B.

The eukaryotic counterpart of the prokaryotic L8 is the “P complex” consisting of homodimers of P1 and P2 and monomeric P0 (15Rich B.E. Steitz J.A. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1990; 265: 89-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An essential role of protein P0 for assembly of the complex into yeast ribosomes and for cell viability has also been shown in vivo(19Santos C. Ballesta J.P. J. Biol.

Rat P complex reconstituted from isolated P1, P2, and P0 specifically binds to the GTPase-associated domain of 28 S rRNA, probably through P0 protein (21Uchiumi T. Kominami R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19179-19185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Uchiumi T. Kominami R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3302-3308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This binding site is nearly equivalent to that for the Escherichia coli L8 complex in 23 S rRNA, as determined by footprinting (23Egebjerg J. Douthwaite S. Liljas A. Garrett R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 275-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 24Rosendahl G. Douthwaite S. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 1013-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In contrast with this similar RNA recognition feature of the stalk protein complexes, amino acid sequence homology of each protein constituent is very low between prokaryotic and eukaryotic counterparts (25Shimmin L.C. Ramirez C. Matheson A.T. Dennis P.P. J. Mol. Evol. 1989; 29: 448-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 26Wool I.G. Chan Y.-L. Gluck A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 933-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). It is therefore presumed that the evolutionary divergence between prokaryotic L8 complex and eukaryotic P complex may parallel the luck of sequence similarity at the regions of EF-G and EF-2 interacting with their respective pentameric complexes. We here attempt to replace L8 complex in E. coli ribosomes with the rat counterpart. The L8 complex is specifically detached from the GTPase-associated RNA domain within the ribosome in ethanol/NH4Cl (12Pettersson I. Hardy S.J.S. Liljas A. FEBS Lett. 1976; 64: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 27Hamel E. Koka M. Nakamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 805-814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and subsequently the rat P complex is incorporated into the core ribosome. This replacement of the stalk protein complex changes the specificity of translocase interaction from prokaryotic EF-G to eukaryotic EF-2. The results demonstrate the functional significance of the ribosomal stalk protein complex and its binding to the GTPase-associated RNA domain for the ribosome-translocase interaction. The results also provide information about conserved features of rRNA involved in the translocase binding. E. coli Q13 cells (10 g) were ground with 20 g of alumina, and ribosomes were extracted with 20 ml of buffer A containing 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NH4Cl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The lysate was centrifuged twice for 30 min at 20,000 ×g. The supernatant was layered on 1.2 m sucrose cushion in Buffer A and ultracentrifuged for 14 h at 45,000 rpm (160,000 × g) in a Hitachi P50A2 rotor at 4 °C. The ribosome pellet was suspended in 20 ml of Buffer B containing 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 m NH4Cl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Ribosomes were pelleted by ultracentrifugation for 3 h at 45,000 rpm with the same rotor. The salt wash was repeated two more times, and the ribosome pellet was resuspended in buffer A and stored at −80 °C. The L8 complex in E. coli 70 S ribosomes was removed according to Hamel et al. (27Hamel E. Koka M. Nakamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 805-814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications, as follows. The salt-washed 70 S ribosomes (200A 260 units) in 2 ml of the extraction buffer consisting of 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mNH4Cl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, were preincubated at 30 °C for 5 min. The solution was mixed with 1 ml of ethanol (prewarmed at 30 °C) with stirring at 30 °C. After 10 min, another 1 ml of ethanol was added, and stirring was continued for 5 min at 30 °C. The solution was centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 10 min, and the ribosomal pellet was dissolved in 2 ml of the extraction buffer. The same extraction was repeated once. Isolation of the resulting core ribosomes and split proteins was as described (27Hamel E. Koka M. Nakamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 805-814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By this treatment, proteins L7/L12 and L10 constituting L8 complex were predominantly released from the ribosomes, as observed by 16.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1) and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (29Wada A. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1986; 100: 1583-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Besides major proteins L7/L12 and L10, trace amounts of L1, L11, and S2 were also released from 70 S ribosomes by the extraction. The mammalian ribosomal P complex was reconstituted in vitro by mixing proteins P0, P1, and P2 isolated from rat liver ribosomes, as described previously (21Uchiumi T. Kominami R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19179-19185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Formation of the complex was confirmed by 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions (22Uchiumi T. Kominami R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3302-3308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The DNA fragment comprising residues 1029–1127 (GTPase-associated domain) of 23 S rRNA was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (30Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Sharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13494) Google Scholar) and inserted into HindIII and XbaI sites of an expression vector, pSPT18 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The RNA fragment was synthesized with SP-6 RNA polymerase and isolated, as described previously (31Uchiumi T. Sato N. Wada A. Hachimori A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 681-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The [32P]RNA fragment (5 pmol) was renatured by incubation at 40 °C for 20 min in 5 μl of solution containing 20 mm MgCl2, 300 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. After addition of protein samples, the mixture was incubated further at 30 °C for 10 min. RNA-protein binding was examined by electrophoresis in 6% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio of 40:1) at 6.5 V/cm, with a buffer system consisting of 5 mmMgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 4 °C (22Uchiumi T. Kominami R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3302-3308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The E. coli core 70 S ribosomes (130 pmol) were incubated with 16 μg of the P complex in 1 ml of 15 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NH4Cl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at 37 °C for 5 min. The sample solution was layered on 34 ml of 10–28% linear sucrose gradient in 15 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NH4Cl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The gradient was centrifuged for 7 h at 23,000 rpm (68,000 × g in the middle of the gradient tube) and 4 °C in a Hitachi P28S swing rotor, and 1.2-ml fractions were collected from the bottom of the gradient. The ribosomes were located by absorbance at 260 nm. A portion of each fraction was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis, followed by immunoblotting using anti-P monoclonal antibody which reacts with all P0, P1, and P2 (18Uchiumi T. Traut R.R. Kominami R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 89-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TheE. coli core ribosomes (2.5 pmol) were incubated with or without the rat P complex, as indicated in the figure legends, in 10 μl of a buffer containing 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NH4Cl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at 37 °C for 5 min. The eukaryotic EF-2-dependent GTPase hydrolysis was started by mixing another 10 μl of the same buffer containing 0.5 μg of EF-2, and 3 nmol [γ-32P]GTP (60–100 cpm/pmol). In the case of the prokaryotic EF-G-dependent GTP hydrolysis, the reaction was started by mixing the same buffer solution containing 0.5 μg of EF-G, and 30 nmol of [γ-32P]GTP (6–10 cpm/pmol). To expand lower activities dependent on EF-2, we used 3 nmol of [γ-32P]GTP with higher specific radioactivity instead of 30 nmol used for the prokaryotic EF-G-dependent activities. No marked difference of EF-2-dependent activity of rat 80 S ribosomes or hybrid ribosomes was observed between the two concentrations of GTP used (not shown). The reaction proceeded for 10 min at 37 °C and was stopped by adding 0.1 ml of solution consisting of 0.02 N silicotungstic acid and 0.02 N H2SO4. The solution was mixed with 0.1 ml of 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 5% ammonium molybdate in 4 N H2SO4. The inorganic phosphate liberated was then extracted with 0.4 ml of isobutyl alcohol-benzene (1:1) (32Kaziro Y. Inoue-Yokosawa N. Kawakita M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1972; 72: 853-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and counted in an Aloka liquid scintillation counter, LSC-1000. The data represented in Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7 are means of 2–4 assays. The mammalian translocase EF-2 was purified from pig liver, as descried previously (33Iwasaki K. Kaziro Y. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 60: 657-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). E. coli EF-G was purified as described by Kaziro et al.(32Kaziro Y. Inoue-Yokosawa N. Kawakita M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1972; 72: 853-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Puromycin- and high KCl-treated 80 S ribosomes were prepared from rat liver, as described previously (34Uchiumi T. Kikuchi M. Terao K. Iwasaki K. Ogata K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 156: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The eukaryotic ribosomal P complex is believed to be the counterpart of prokaryotic L8 complex that constitutes the ribosomal stalk. We have reconstituted the P complex from isolated rat proteins P0, P1, and P2 and shown its binding site in 28 S rRNA to be nearly equivalent to that for E. coli L8 complex in 23 S rRNA (22Uchiumi T. Kominami R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3302-3308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We tested cross-binding of the rat P complex to the E. coliGTPase-associated domain by gel retardation using an RNA fragment comprising residues 1029–1127 (Fig.2 A). The P complex strongly bound to the E. coli RNA domain (Fig.2 B, lane 3). Interestingly, the stability of this RNA-protein complex was higher than that with the cognate protein L8 (lane 2). This binding ability of the P complex for E. coli RNA was comparable with that for rat RNA (see Ref. 22Uchiumi T. Kominami R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3302-3308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To test whether the rat P complex binds to E. coli core ribosomes lacking the L8 complex (Fig. 1), the core ribosomes were incubated with the P complex and then analyzed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and immunoblotting with anti-P monoclonal antibody reactive with P0, P1, and P2. The P complex bound to 70 S ribosomes and 50 S subunits, but not to 30 S subunits (Fig. 3 A). These bindings were prevented by adding an excess amount of the RNA fragment encompassing the GTPase-associated domain (Fig. 3 B). The results suggest that the rat P complex was incorporated into the E. coliribosome through its binding to the GTPase-associated domain. We termed the resultant particles “E. coli-rat hybrid ribosomes.” In this experiment, a significant portion of the core 70 S ribosomes was dissociated into 50 and 30 S subunits by ultracentrifugation in 15 mm MgCl2 (upper panels), a condition that normally gives only 70 S couples. This dissociation occurred, irrespective of binding of P complex (see upper panels of Fig. 3, A and B), suggesting that removal of L8 complex from the 50 S subunits lowers their affinity for 30 S subunits. The hybrid ribosomes as well as E. coli 70 S and rat 80 S ribosomes were tested for interaction with the translocase proteins by measuring their GTPase activity dependent on prokaryotic EF-G (Fig. 4 A) and eukaryotic EF-2 (Fig. 4 B). Intact E. coli (70S) and rat ribosomes (80S) had activities specific to prokaryotic EF-G and eukaryotic EF-2, respectively. The activity of the former was about 10-fold higher than the latter. The hybrid ribosomes (70S-P) showed eukaryotic EF-2-dependent activity (Fig. 4 B) but not prokaryotic EF-G-dependent activity (Fig. 4 A). The level of EF-2-dependent activity of the hybrid ribosome was comparable with that of rat 80 S ribosomes (Fig. 4 B) but lower than that of intact E. coli ribosomes dependent on EF-G (Fig. 4 A). The induction of EF-2-dependent activity of E. coli core ribosomes was apparently because of addition of the P complex. The P complex alone, however, was inactive (Fig. 5).Figure 5Induction of EF-2-dependent GTPase activity by mixing rat P complex and E. colicore ribosomes. Increasing amounts of rat P complex were preincubated with 2.5 pmol of E. coli core ribosomes (●) and without the core ribosome (■) and their GTPase activity dependent on eukaryotic EF-2 was tested.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Induction of EF-2-dependent activity by mixing the E. coli core ribosomes and rat P complex was prevented by adding the RNA fragment encompassing the GTPase-associated domain, a competitor for the binding site of P complex (Fig.6). This result is consistent with a failure of the hybrid formation by adding the RNA competitor (Fig. 3 B) and suggests that binding of the P complex to the GTPase-associated domain is crucial for EF-2-dependent GTPase activity. The antibiotic thiostrepton binds to the GTPase-associated domain ofE. coli ribosomes and inhibits GTPase activity dependent on prokaryotic EF-G (35Cundliffe E. Hill W.E. Dahlberg A. Garrett R.A. Moore P.B. Schlessinger D. Warner J.R. The Ribosome: Structure, Function, & Evolution. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1990: 479-490Google Scholar). This drug was used to test whether the RNA domain of E. coli ribosomes participates in EF-2-dependent GTPase activity in the hybrid ribosome. As shown in Fig. 7, the EF-2-dependent activity of the hybrid ribosome, unlike that of the rat 80 S ribosome, was inhibited by thiostrepton, although its inhibition efficiency was not as high as for the intact E. coli ribosome. This result suggests that the same RNA domain ofE. coli 23 S rRNA is involved in the eukaryotic EF-2-dependent GTPase activity of the hybrid ribosome as well as in the prokaryotic EF-G dependent activity of the native 70 S ribosome. It is generally recognized that the eukaryotic translocase EF-2 does not function with the prokaryotic 70 S ribosome, and the prokaryotic factor EF-G is not accessible to the eukaryotic 80 S ribosome (36Taira H. Ejiri S. Shimura K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1972; 72: 1527-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 37Grasmuk H. Nolan R.D. Drews J. FEBS Lett. 1977; 82: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates that replacement of the stalk protein complex L10-L7/L12 (L8 complex) in E. coliribosome with rat counterpart P0-P1-P2 (P complex) changes the factor binding specificity from EF-G (homologous) to EF-2 (heterologous). This hybrid system provides clear evidence that the stalk protein complex is the major ribosomal component responsible for kingdom-dependent specificity of the ribosome-translocase interaction. We have also attempted the replacement of protein L7/L12 component of E. coli ribosomes with the rat counterpart P1/P2 by removing specifically L7/L12 from the ribosomes (27Hamel E. Koka M. Nakamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 805-814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and mixing the core with the rat proteins, but we failed to detect neither activity dependent on prokaryotic EF-G nor eukaryotic EF-2 (data not shown). Our results imply that whole bodies of the stalk protein complexes, L10-L7/L12 in prokaryotes and P0-P1-P2 in eukaryotes are the functional units which can be replaced by each other. This may be confirmed by replacement of P complex in the eukaryotic ribosomes with prokaryotic L8 complex, although it is technically difficult up to now. Rat P complex apparently binds to the E. coli core ribosome by its direct interaction with the GTPase-associated RNA domain of 23 S rRNA, presumably through P0 moiety. This is supported by evidence that the P complex strongly cross-binds to the RNA fragment coveringE. coli GTPase-associated domain (Fig. 2) and that binding of the P complex to the core ribosome is prevented by addition of the RNA fragment as a binding competitor (Fig. 3). This binding causes induction of eukaryotic EF-2-dependent GTPase activity of the ribosome (Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6). These data show the functional significance of the RNA-protein interaction. Moreover, it is notable that the induced EF-2-dependent GTPase activity is inhibited by the antibiotic thiostrepton which specifically binds to the prokaryotic GTPase domain and inhibits the prokaryotic EF-G-dependent GTPase activity (Fig. 7). This implies that the E. coli GTPase RNA domain has an ability to participate in the eukaryotic EF-2-dependent GTPase activity in the presence of the P complex. It is noteworthy that the hybrid ribosome shows some resistance to inhibition by thiostrepton compared with the intact E. coliribosome (Fig. 7). A simple explanation of this result is that L11, the protein responsible for efficient thiostrepton binding (35Cundliffe E. Hill W.E. Dahlberg A. Garrett R.A. Moore P.B. Schlessinger D. Warner J.R. The Ribosome: Structure, Function, & Evolution. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1990: 479-490Google Scholar, 38Xing Y. Draper Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1581-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), is absent from a part of ribosome population. However, this is unlikely, because addition of excess L11 at the time of the hybrid formation gave no marked effect on the thiostrepton resistance (data not shown). It is more likely that the binding of the heterologous P complex affects the RNA conformation of the thiostrepton/L11 binding site. If this is the case, the slight conformational change of the RNA domain may take part in the conversion of the translocase accessibility from prokaryotic EF-G to eukaryotic EF-2. We infer that the stalk protein complex may play a role not only in interacting directly with the translocase, but also in modulating the functional conformation of rRNA. Studies by three dimensional cryo-electron microscopy (39Agrawal R.K. Penczek P. Grassucci R.A. Frank J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6134-6138Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) and directed hydroxyl radical probing (40Wilson K. Noller H. Cell. 1998; 92: 131-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) suggest that EF-G interacts with several sites of the ribosome including the region at the base of the stalk. It is implied that major structural features of the translocase binding site are conserved between eukaryotic and prokaryotic ribosomes except for the stalk protein complex. In fact, two highly conserved regions, the GTPase-associated domain and the sarcin/ricin loop of E. coli 23 S rRNA have been identified as the EF-G binding sites by chemical footprinting analysis (4Moazed D. Robertson J. Noller M., H.F. Nature. 1988; 334: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The equivalent GTPase-associated domain (7Uchiumi T. Kominami R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3389-3394Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and the sarcin/ricin loop 2T. Uchiumi, unpublished results. of rat 28 S rRNA are also protected by binding of eukaryotic EF-2. A portion of the GTPase domain including residues 1056–1103 of E. coli 23 S rRNA can be replaced with the homologous sequence of yeast 26 S rRNA without significant loss of the EF-G-dependent GTPase activity of the E. coli ribosome (41Thompson J. Musters W. Cundliffe E. Dahlberg A.E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1499-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Directed hydroxyl radical probing analysis by Wilson and Noller has clarified proximity relationships between EF-G and several other rRNA elements whose secondary structures are conserved between prokaryotes and eukaryotes (40Wilson K. Noller H. Cell. 1998; 92: 131-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Therefore, we infer that the stalk protein complex and several conserved rRNA regions are the main determinants of the translocase-dependent function in the ribosome. The x-ray crystallographic studies have defined five domains of EF-G (42Czworkowski J. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Moore P.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3661-3668Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 43Ævarsson A. Brazhnikov E. Garber M. Zheltonosova J. Chirgadze Y. Al-Karadaghi S. Svensson L.A. Liljas A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3669-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Domains I and II are homologous to those of EF-Tu, and domains III, IV, and V mimic the size and shape of the tRNA portion of the EF-Tu-aminoacyl-tRNA-GTP ternary complex (44Nissen P. Kjeldgaard M. Thirup S. Polekhina G. Reshetnikova L. Clark B.F. Nyborg J. Science. 1995; 270: 1464-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). The cryo-electron microscopic study on the ribosome-EF-G complex has shown that domains I and V are located at the base of the stalk and also that there is an “arc-like” connection between the stalk and the G′ subdomain within domain I of EF-G (39Agrawal R.K. Penczek P. Grassucci R.A. Frank J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6134-6138Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). It seems to be likely that the kingdom-dependent specificity of factor-ribosome interaction rests on the appropriate matching of the stalk protein complex with the G′ domain of translocase.

DNA damage induces specific phosphorylations on N-terminal serine residues of p53 in vivo, possibly catalyzed by various stress kinases, thereby preventing Mdm2 binding, which in turn alleviates transcriptional inhibition and stabilizes p53 by inhibiting its degradation (3Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar, 4Siliciano J.D. Canman C.E. Taya Y. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3471-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). As a consequence, p53 half-life prolongs from minutes to hours (5Maltzman W. Czyzyk L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1689-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). Conversely, tight regulation of p53 is critical for normal growth of unstressed cells, in which p53 is a short lived protein (half-life, 20–30 min) that is maintained at low, often undetectable levels through continuous degradation mainly directed by Mdm2. Hence, Mdm2 is largely responsible for the high p53 turnover in undamaged cells (6Böttger A. Böttger V. Sparks A. Liu W.L. Howard S.F. Lane D.P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 860-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Mdm2-mediated p53 degradation occurs through a ubiquitin-dependent pathway on cytoplasmic 26S proteasomes (7Maki C.G. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2649-2654PubMed Google Scholar, 8Freedman D.A. Epstein C.B. Roth J.C. Levine A.J. Mol. Med. 1997; 3: 248-259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mdm2 functions as a p53-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase in vitro (9Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar) and this ubiquitination probably takes place in the nucleus on the large p300/CBP protein, serving as a scaffolding (10Grossman S.R. Perez M. Kung A.L. Joseph M. Mansur C. Xiao Z.X. Kumar S. Howley P.M. Livingston D.M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 405-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Recent studies of p53 turnover using overexpression assays with p53 and Mdm2 mutants elucidated some structural requirements for Mdm2-dependent destruction of p53. Together, these studies reveal the importance of several regions on both proteins, particularly on the N and C termini, the precise contributions of which, however, are not all understood. A basic but insufficient requirement is a direct interaction between the two proteins through their N termini. An Mdm2-binding site mutant of p53 (conserved box I) is resistant to degradation by Mdm2 (1Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3750) Google Scholar, 2Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2860) Google Scholar). Crystallographic analysis of the interacting domains has shown a tight key-lock configuration (11Kussie P.H. Gorina S. Marechal V. Elenbaas B. Moreau J. Levine A.J. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 948-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1812) Google Scholar), with p53 domain amino acids 17–27 fitting deeply into a hydrophobic cleft of Mdm2. Also, Mdm2 shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, and Mdm2-directed degradation of p53 depends on a functional nuclear export signal of Mdm2 (12Roth J. Dobbelstein M. Freedman D.A. Shenk T. Levine A.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 554-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 13Freedman D.A. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7288-7293Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 14Tao W. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3077-3080Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Lastly, the C-terminal RING finger domain of Mdm2 is somehow required, because deletion or mutations in this region act as dominant negative mutants and protect p53 from degradation by endogenous Mdm2 (15Kubbutat M.H. Ludwig R.L. Levine A.J. Vousden K.H. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 87-92PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the p14ARF protein, which binds to the C-terminal region of Mdm2, can inhibit Mdm2-mediated p53 degradation without disrupting the p53-Mdm2 complex (16Kamijo T. Weber J.D. Zambetti G.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5001-5014Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar), possibly due to inhibiting the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of Mdm2 (19Honda R. Yasuda H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). To date, known requirements on p53 include p53 tetramerization, which, although not absolutely required, enhances degradability, possibly via improved Mdm2 binding. A monomeric p53 mutant lost sensitivity to degradation by Mdm2 (20Kubbutat M.H. Ludwig R.L. Ashcroft M. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5690-5698Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Also, the extreme C terminus of p53 (amino acids 363–393) is required, because p53 mutants with deletions of this region show constitutive Mdm2 resistance in unstressed cells due to an unknown mechanism (20Kubbutat M.H. Ludwig R.L. Ashcroft M. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5690-5698Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Certain human tumors, including neuroblastoma (21Moll U.M. LaQuaglia M.

Wahl G.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), constitutively accumulate high levels of wild type p53 protein in their cytoplasm in the absence of stress. This is due to a dramatic increase in p53 half-life (>8 h in unstressed neuroblastoma cells) (30Davidoff A.M. Pence J.C. Shorter N.A. Iglehart J.D. Marks J.R. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 127-133PubMed Google Scholar), thereby stabilizing the protein. Thus, this phenotype is due to inefficient degradation of p53 rather than to increased synthesis. The cytoplasmic p53 accumulation is also the hallmark of a concomitant defect in p53 function in response to genotoxic stress (31Moll U.M. Ostermeyer A.G. Haladay R. Winkfield B. Frazier M. Zambetti G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1126-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 32Isaacs J.S. Hardman R. Carman T.A. Barrett J.C. Weissman B.E.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4407-4411Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 22Moll U.M. Riou G. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7262-7266Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). We recently showed that this seemingly static sequestration of p53 is in fact not due to a blocked nuclear entry but due to a dynamic imbalance characterized by hyperactive p53 export from the nucleus (33Stommel J.M. Marchenko N.D. Jimenez G.S. Moll U.M. Hope T.J. Wahl G.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1660-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Functional inactivation of p53 in response to stress is therefore to a large degree due to an inefficiency in nuclear retention of p53 (31Moll U.M. Ostermeyer A.G. Haladay R. Winkfield B. Frazier M. Zambetti G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1126-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 32Isaacs J.S. Hardman R. Carman T.A. Barrett J.C. Weissman B.E.

Biol. 1998; 8: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Using human neuroblastoma cell lines, we show here that the aberrant constitutive p53 accumulation in these cells is due to resistance to Mdm2-mediated degradation. This resistance is observed despite normal levels of Mdm2 protein, p53-Mdm2 complexes, and p53 ubiquitination. Instead, stabilization correlates with covalent modification of p53, characterized by an acidic shift in the charge isoform profile of p53 and masking of its modification-sensitive 421 epitope. This system provides evidence for a novel level of in vivo regulation of p53 destruction by Mdm2 linked to posttranslational p53 modification. The following cell lines were of human origin: the neuroblastoma lines LAN-5, SK-N-SH, IMR 32, CHP 134, and SK-N-AS exhibit constitutive cytoplasmic accumulation of wild type p53 protein. The osteosarcoma line SaOs-2 is homozygously deleted for p53; the neuroepithelioma line CHP 100 is deficient for p53 expression due to aberrant mRNA; the chronic myelogenous leukemia line ML-1, the fibrosarcoma line HT 1080, and the diploid immortal fibroblast line IMR 90 all contain low levels of functional wild type p53; and the colon carcinoma line RKO contains mildly elevated levels of functional wild type p53. The breast cancer lines MDA 231 and MDA 468 harbor a R280K and R273K mutation, respectively. Mouse DM cells harbor an amplification of the Mdm2 gene (34Fakharzadeh S.S. Trusko S.P. George D.L. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1565-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). All cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% fetal calf serum. For p53 ubiquitination, proteasome inhibitor MG101 (50 mm) (Sigma) was added to the culture medium for 5 h before lysates were prepared. Baculoviral human wild type p53 protein was purified on a MonoQ column and appeared as a single band on silver gels. Various normal human tissues were collected at University Hospital Stony Brook during surgical resections and immediately snap frozen after harvesting. Undifferentiated neuroblastoma tumors were previously described and collected in the same way (21Moll U.M. LaQuaglia M. Benard J. Riou G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4407-4411Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Human Mdm2 expression plasmids, all pCMV BamNeo-based (35Baker S.J. Markowitz S. Fearon E.R. Willson J.K.V. Vogelstein B.V. Science. 1990; 249: 912-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar), were kindly provided by Arnold J. Levine. HDM2 encodes wild type Mdm2 (36Oliner J.D. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Gyuris J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1993; 362: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar), G58A encodes a contact mutant of Mdm2 that abolishes its interaction with p53 (8Freedman D.A. Epstein C.B. Roth J.C. Levine A.J. Mol. Med. 1997; 3: 248-259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and mutant nuclear export signal encodes an export mutant of Mdm2, leading to its nuclear retention due to the change of two critical hydrophobic residues within the nuclear export signal (L205A and I208A) (12Roth J. Dobbelstein M. Freedman D.A. Shenk T. Levine A.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 554-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). N-terminally FLAG-tagged human wild type p53 (Fwtp53) was generated by polymerase chain reaction using pC53-SN3 (35Baker S.J. Markowitz S. Fearon E.R. Willson J.K.V. Vogelstein B.V. Science. 1990; 249: 912-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar) as template. The sense primer contained a BamHI site upstream of the sequence encoding the FLAG octapeptide (5′-AG CAG TTG GGA TCC ATG GAC TAC AAG GAC GAC GAT GAC AAG ATG GAG GAG CCG CAG TCA GAT CCT AGC G-3′), and the antisense primer also contained a BamHI site (5′-TTA TTC GGA TCC AGA ATG TCA GTC TGA GTC AGG CCC-3′). The polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into pCMV BamNeo. The pFwtp53 plasmid was also used to construct the p53 C-terminal plasmids F305–360 and F320–360 by polymerase chain reaction overlap extension technique as described (33Stommel J.M. Marchenko N.D. Jimenez G.S. Moll U.M. Hope T.J. Wahl G.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1660-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). The plasmid pcDNA3-Myc-ARF expressing human wild type p14ARF fused to a Myc tag was described previously (37Zhang Y. Xiong Y. Yarbrough W.G. Cell. 1998; 92: 725-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1411) Google Scholar). Green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression plasmid (CLONTECH) was co-transfected in transient transfections to normalize relative transfection efficiency. Cells were plated in 60-mm dishes and grown overnight to 80% confluence. Two mg of Mdm2 wild type or mutant-encoding plasmid was co-transfected with 0.4 mg of GFP-encoding plasmid and 0.6 mg of wild type p53-encoding plasmid or CMV BamNeo empty vector using the LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) as recommended by the manufacturer. For transient transfections, cells were collected after 24 h, whereas stable transformants were selected by growth for 21 days in medium containing 0.5 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.), ring cloned, and expanded into single cell clones. For Myc-p14ARF expression, 2 mg of plasmid was used. Cell lysates from unstressed cells were prepared as described (31Moll U.M. Ostermeyer A.G. Haladay R. Winkfield B. Frazier M. Zambetti G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1126-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), subjected to 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nylon membranes. Immunoblots were visualized by ECL (Pierce). Cell lysates (1 mg of total protein) were immunoprecipitated with 1.5 μg of the indicated antibody, incubated with 30 μl of protein G-agarose beads (Life Technologies, Inc.), washed five times in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, 0.15m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, pH 7.4) and visualized as described (31Moll U.M. Ostermeyer A.G. Haladay R. Winkfield B. Frazier M. Zambetti G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1126-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Antibodies to p53 were monoclonals PAb 421, 1801, and DO-1 (Oncogene Science), which recognize epitopes amino acids 372–382 (421), 46–55 (1801), and 20–25 (DO1). CM-1 is a polyclonal rabbit antibody raised against bacterial recombinant human wild type p53 (Vector). FLAG-tagged p53 constructs were detected with M2 (Eastman Kodak Co.). Mdm2 was detected with monoclonal IF2 (Oncogene Science). Other antibodies used were specific for vimentin (BioGenex), GFP (CLONTECH), Myc (NeoMarker), IkBa (Santa Cruz), actin (Sigma), mouse IgG (Sigma), and Lamin A (Chemicon). Crude cell lysates (2–20 mg), prepared by sonication without ionic detergents and low salt (37Zhang Y. Xiong Y. Yarbrough W.G. Cell. 1998; 92: 725-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1411) Google Scholar), were mixed with equal volume of 2× sample buffer (4.8 g urea, 120 ml each of ampholytes pH 4–6 and 5–7 (Bio-Lyte, Bio-Rad), 1 ml of 20% Triton X-100, 100 ml of 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mg of bromphenol blue in 10 ml of H2O) 5 min before loading. Loaded lysates and pH markers (Bio-Rad) were overlaid with 1% mixed ampholytes and 5% sucrose to protect proteins from the harsh pH conditions of the upper chamber. Proteins were resolved along a gradient of pH 7–4 on one-dimensional slab mini gels using polyacrylamide containing 8 m urea and 120 ml each of ampholyte pH 4–6 and pH 5–7 as described (38Copeland R.A. Methods for Protein Analysis. A Practical Guide to Laboratory Protocols. Chapman & Hall, New York1994Google Scholar). The upper chamber buffer (500 ml of catholyte, 20 mm sodium hydroxide) and lower chamber buffer (500 ml of anolyte, 10 mm phosphoric acid) were prepared fresh and degassed, and gels were run at 150 V for 30 min followed by 200 V for 3 h. Gels were transferred to nylon membranes and p53 was detected by immunoblotting with DO-1. In parallel, equal aliquots were run on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels followed by DO-1 immunoblotting to verify p53 loading. Subconfluent cells in P100 dishes were refed 4 h prior to calcium phosphate-mediated transfection with 20 mg each of p53 C-terminal peptide or empty vector DNA constructs. After overnight incubation, cells were aliquoted into polylysine-coated chamber culture slides (Becton Dickinson) and grown for an additional 24 h. Cells were immunostained as described (33Stommel J.M. Marchenko N.D. Jimenez G.S. Moll U.M. Hope T.J. Wahl G.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1660-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar) and examined with a Nikon scanning laser microscope. Expression of constructs was verified by FLAG antibodies and was reproducible with transfection efficiency over 50% (data not shown). To exclude the possibility that the constitutively high levels of wild type p53 protein in neuroblastoma (NB) cells are due to a lack of expression of its destabilizer Mdm2, we compared a panel of NB cells (SK-N-SH, LAN-5, IMR 32, CHP 134 and SK-N-AS) with a broad range of other human cell lines (Fig.1 A and data not shown). These made up four different types of p53 steady state levels, including p53-deficient cells (SaOs-2 and CHP 100), low levels of functional p53 (HT 1080, IMR 90, and ML-1), mildly elevated levels of functional p53 (RKO), and markedly increased levels of mutant p53 due to a failure to induce Mdm2 (MDA 231 and 468). Fig. 1 A shows that steady state levels of Mdm2 protein in NB cells are comparable to Mdm2 levels in all other cell lines analyzed, with some variations in expression in both categories. The only exception was an undetectably low Mdm2 level in ML-1 cells (not shown) for reasons that are not clear. A second possibility that could explain the abnormal stability of p53 would be a lack of interaction between p53 and Mdm2. To test this, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays from LAN-5 cells with an Mdm2-specific antibody. Fig. 1 B shows the presence of p53-Mdm2 complexes indicating their interaction in vivo (lanes SaOs-2 and RKO). Moreover, the amount of complexed p53 in LAN-5 cells is similar to the amount in IMR 90 control cells (compare lanes RKO and HT1080). IMR 90 fibroblasts contain low levels of functional p53, indicating sensitivity to Mdm2-directed degradation. These data demonstrate that the abnormal p53 stability in NB cells is not due to a lack of p53-Mdm2 interaction. To further demonstrate that Mdm2 function is normal in NB cells, we tested its ability to enter the physiologically important interaction with p14ARF. Fig. 1 C shows readily demonstrablein vivo complexes between Mdm2 and p14ARF, co-immunoprecipitated from a stably expressing Mdm2 NB cell line (clone HDM2–2 of Fig. 2 D) and transiently transfected with Myc-tagged p14ARF. Next we examined whether p53 ubiquitination in NB cells is deficient, because poor ubiquitination of p53 could lead to its stabilization. Also, Mdm2 is a p53-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase in vitro. LAN-5 cells and ML-1 control cells, which contain low levels of p53 indicating Mdm2 sensitivity, were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG101 for 5 h. p53 stabilized in both cases to a similar degree (Fig. 1 C, top panel, lowest band). More importantly, the ladder of polyubiquitinated p53 species were similar in LAN-5 and ML-1 cells (Fig. 1 D). This indicates that the in vivoubiquitination of p53, whether catalyzed by Mdm2 or some other E3 ligase, is functional in NB cells. Furthermore, these data also show that NB cells do not have a global functional defect of their proteasomes in processing ubiquitin-tagged proteins, because if this were the case, ubiquitinated p53 should have been easily detected even in untreated cells. To further confirm this point, we asked whether the processing of other proteasome-degraded proteins is normal in NB cells. IkBa, the cytoplasmic inhibitor of NFkB, is a prototype protein undergoing ubiquitin-mediated proteasome degradation (39Laney J.D. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1999; 97: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Fig.1 E shows that IkBa levels in NB cells are completely within the range of non-NB cells, indicating normal ubiquitin/proteasome processing in NB cells. Likewise, the same reasoning holds for Mdm2, the levels of which in NB cells are within normal range, as shown above (Fig. 1 A), because Mdm2 itself is degraded via the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (40Chang Y.C. Lee Y.S. Tejima T. Tanaka K. Omura S. Heintz N.H. Mitsui Y. Magae J. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 79-84PubMed Google Scholar). Although endogenous Mdm2 in NB cells is sufficiently expressed and enters into complexes with p53, it still left the possibility that Mdm2 had a specific defect in directing p53 destruction. We therefore asked whether the abnormal p53 stability could be overcome by overexpression of functional ectopic Mdm2 protein. SaOs-2 control cells (p53 null), transiently transfected with human wild type p53 (Fig. 2 A, lane 2), showed a dramatic decrease in the endogenous p53 protein level when co-transfected with wild type Mdm2 (lane 3) but not with a p53-contact mutant of Mdm2 (G58A) (lane 4) as described previously (1Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3750) Google Scholar, 2Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2860) Google Scholar, 12Roth J. Dobbelstein M. Freedman D.A. Shenk T. Levine A.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 554-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). In contrast, endogenous p53 protein from LAN-5 (Fig. 2 B) and SK-N-SH (Fig. 2 C) was completely resistant to degradation by forced expression of wild type Mdm2 (Fig. 2, B and C, compare lanes 1and 2 with lane 3), as well as to a nuclear export mutant of Mdm2 (Fig. 2, B and C, lane 4) and to a contact mutant of Mdm2 (Fig. 2, B and C, lane 5). To confirm this result, we generated a series of stable LAN-5 subclones that overexpress either vector alone, wild type Mdm2, or contact mutant Mdm2. Of six wild type Mdm2 clones, all showed marked resistance of p53 protein toward degradation (Fig. 2 D,compare lanes 2–5 with lanes 1, 6, and7). Taken together, the data demonstrate that the abnormal stability of p53 in NB cells is due to a profound resistance of the p53 protein to Mdm2-directed degradation and strongly suggest that the principal defect lies in p53 and not in Mdm2. To further support this conclusion, we asked whether exogenous human wild type p53, when transfected into NB cells, was also resistant to overexpressed Mdm2. Fig. 3 shows that this is indeed the case. FLAG-tagged p53 (Fwtp53), when transiently transfected into SK-N-SH and LAN-5 cells, is markedly resistant to co-transfected wild type Mdm2, as it is resistant to contact mutant Mdm2 (Fig. 3, compare lane 2 with lane 3 and4). Together, these data show that the cellular environment of NB cells causes the loss of sensitivity of the p53 protein toward Mdm2-regulated turnover. Because the above results imply the p53 protein itself in mediating its degradation defect, we investigated whether wild type p53 protein from NB cells is constitutively subject to altered posttranslational modification. Immune-isoelectric focusing is a commonly used technique to characterize charge isoform profiles of proteins. The high urea content used in the polyacrylamide gels (8m) ensures the elimination of protein-protein interactions as another potential source of charge alterations. Cell lysates from SK-N-SH and LAN-5 reveal an identical and specific shift in their p53 charge isoform profiles when compared with control p53 proteins derived from cellular (MDA 231) or baculoviral sources (Fig.4 A, left panel). Both NB lines show a shift in profile toward four prominent hyperacidic isoforms with isoelectric points (pI) ranging from about 4.6 to 5.3 (20 μg SH and 15 μg LAN-5). In contrast, both control p53 proteins exhibit inverted profiles (in relative proportions of the individual species) that are dominated by more basic isoforms (2 μg MDA 231 and 60 ng bac p53). Purified baculoviral human wild type p53 (60 ng bac p53) has been shown to exhibit identical posttranslational modifications to normal cellular p53 (41Patterson R.M. He C. Selkirk J.K. Merrick B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330s: 71-79Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Mutant p53 from MDA 231 cells (2 μg MDA 231) harbors a charge-neutral R280K exchange with loss of transactivating function. MDA 231-derived p53 was chosen to show that p53 modification is not a consequence of abnormal stability (which in this case is caused by the inability of mutant p53 to induce Mdm2). Both profiles consist of several tightly packed coalescing isoforms with pIs ranging from 6 to 6.5, whereas the hyperacidic species so characteristic for NB cells make up only a minor fraction. Conversely, the presence of the basic species in NB cells was not consistent and, even when present, presented only minor fractions. Supporting these data, on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels, neuroblastoma tumors and NB cell lines exhibit two p53 bands after immunoprecipitation, which are best seen with the polyclonal CM-1 antibody. Of these, the dominant p53 species runs slower than the faster migrating single p53 species present in normal human tissues and ML-1 cells (Fig. 4"

Amino acid substitution at only three residues, including Asp-76 (Kim, B., Hathaway, T. R., and Loeb, L. A. (1996)Biochemistry 37, 5831–5839), is known to increase fidelity. We report here that substitution at Arg-78 can also increase accuracy. Mutant R78A RT showed reduced primer extension in misincorporation assays lacking a complementary dNTP and exhibited a 9-fold decrease in mutation frequency in the M13mp2 lacZforward mutation assay. Previous structural studies indicate that Arg-78 and Asp-76 lie in a region that interacts with template nucleotides. Interestingly, R78A RT exhibited 6- to 8-fold decreases in binding affinity (K d) for RNA and DNA templates relative to wild type RT. In contrast, D76V RT, which also increases fidelity (Kim et al., 1996), showed a 6- to 7-fold increased affinity. The processivity of R78A RT on both RNA and DNA templates was substantially reduced relative to wild type RT, whereas the processivity of D76V RT was increased.

Hypervariation of HIV-1 genomes can be achieved by at least three unique viral replication processes. First, mutations can be synthesized by the virally encoded DNA polymerase, HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) (1Coffin J.M. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Chanock R.M. Howley P.M. Melnick J.L. Monath T.P. Roizman B. Straus S.E. Retroviridae and Their Replication in Virology. Raven Press Ltd., New York1990: 1437-1500Google Scholar, 2Coffin J.M. Science. 1995; 267: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1691) Google Scholar). HIV-1 RT is the most error prone of all known DNA polymerases (3Roberts J.D. Preston B.D. Johnston L.A. Soni A. Loeb L.A. Kunkel T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 4Williams K.J. Loeb L.A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 176: 165-180PubMed Google Scholar, 5Bebenek K.

Second, mutations produced by HIV-1 RT can be amplified by recombination, which has been observed in virions containing heterogeneous diploid genomes (8Coffin J.M. Kurstak E. Marusyk F.A. Murphy M.H.V. Van Regenmortel M. Applied Virology Research, Virus Variation and Epidemiology. Plenum Press, New York1990: 11-33Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the occurrence of homologous recombination during viral replication is related to the processivity and strand transfer activity of HIV-1 RT (9Palaniappan C. Wisniewski M. Wu W. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22331-22338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 10Wu W. Blumberg B.M. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 325-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Finally, constant, massive replication amplifies the complexity of the viral population (11Perelson A.S. Neumann A.U. Markowitz M. Leonard J.M. Ho D.D. Science. 1996; 271: 1582-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (2826) Google Scholar). The structural basis of HIV-1 RT infidelity remains to be fully elucidated. Lack of a 3′-5′ proofreading exonuclease activity is a presumptive factor (4Williams K.J. Loeb L.A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 176: 165-180PubMed Google Scholar), but it cannot be the only determinant, because other retroviral RTs that lack a proofreading exonuclease, such as murine leukemia virus RT and AMV RT, have 10- to 18-fold higher fidelity (3Roberts J.D. Preston B.D. Johnston L.A. Soni A. Loeb L.A. Kunkel T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Our knowledge of the structure-function relationships governing the accuracy of other DNA polymerases rests heavily on the analysis of mutants (12Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 13Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6321-6329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); the classic mutants ofEscherichia coli DNA polymerase I are important examples (14Minnick D.T. Bebenek K. Osheroff W.P. Turner Jr., R.M. Astatke M. Liu L. Kunkel T.A. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 274: 3067-3075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Currently available mutants of HIV-1 RT are mostly drug-resistant variants isolated from patients and cell culture systems. Interestingly, it has been reported that drug resistance mutations at Met-184 (M184V, M184I) and Glu-89 (E89G) confer increased fidelity (15Wainberg M.A. Drosopoulos W.C. Salomon H. Hsu M. Borkow G. Parniak M. Gu Z. Song Q. Manne J. Islam S. Castriota G. Prasad V.R. Science. 1996; 271: 1282-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 16Pandey V.N. Kaushik N. Rege N. Sarafianos S.G. Yadav P.N. Modak M.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2168-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 17Oude Essink B.B. Back N.K. Berkhout B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3212-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 18Drosopoulos W.C. Prasad V.R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4834-4838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical studies suggest that these mutations affect accuracy by altering interactions with either the incoming dNTP (M184V and M184I) or with the penultimate nucleotide of the double-stranded template (E89G). Notably, these drug-resistant mutations permit continued viral evolution and escape from selective pressure, suggesting that the changes in fidelity may be rather moderate. Other interactions of HIV-1 RT with its substrates also affect accuracy. Thus, mutations (e.g. G262A and W266A) in the thumb subdomain that interact with the primer have been shown to affect the frequency of frameshift mutations, presumably because of template-primer slippage; these mutations also alter processivity (19Jonckheere H. Witvrouw M. De Clercq E. Anne J. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1998; 14: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar,20Bebenek K. Beard W.A. Casas-Finet J.R. Kim H.R. Darden T.A. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19516-19523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To better understand the structural and mechanistic basis of HIV-1 RT infidelity, we have undertaken a systematic approach to the study of mutants. To obtain novel fidelity mutations, we employ both genetic and biochemical methods (21Beard W.A. Minnick D.T. Wade C.L. Prasad R. Won R.L. Kumar A. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12213-12220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We initially select for catalytically active mutants among a large, randomly mutated RT population by using a genetic complementation system (22Kim B. Hathaway T.R. Loeb L.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5831-5839Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23Kim B. Hathaway T.R. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4872-4878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Mutants with altered accuracy are then identified by screening in a primer extension assay. In this way, we obtain numerous catalytically robust fidelity mutants for detailed biochemical, kinetic, and structural analysis. Other amino acid substitutions of interest, suggested by these genetically selected variants, can then be synthesized by site-directed mutagenesis. Substitutions that confer increased accuracy are of particular relevance because they identify amino acid side chains that are responsible for mutation synthesis by the wild type enzyme. Among genetically selected variants with increased DNA synthetic accuracy (we call them “hi-fi” mutants), we have previously described D76V, which exhibited a 9-fold increase in fidelity in a lacZforward mutation assay, and up to 14-fold increases in the accuracy of nucleotide insertion. Structural studies indicate that Asp-76 interacts with the template nucleotide that base pairs with the incoming dNTP (21Beard W.A. Minnick D.T. Wade C.L. Prasad R. Won R.L. Kumar A. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12213-12220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 24Kim B. Methods ( Orlando ). 1997; 12: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Presumably, in wild type RT, interaction of Asp-76 with the template may promote mispairing with the incoming nucleotide, whereas other residues, such as valine, reduce or abolish this mutagenic interaction. This presumption is consonant with the findings for Glu-89, which also interacts with the template. Glu-89 contacts the template nucleotide that pairs with the penultimate primer nucleotide (18Drosopoulos W.C. Prasad V.R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4834-4838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and mutation, at this site too, can increase fidelity. The mutant E89G exhibits enhanced fidelity (18Drosopoulos W.C. Prasad V.R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4834-4838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), higher processivity, and a decreased dissociation constant from a RT·template·primer complex (25Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations are consistent with our premise, based on the D76V mutation, that amino acid residues involved in interactions with the template can play an important role in HIV-1 RT infidelity (21Beard W.A. Minnick D.T. Wade C.L. Prasad R. Won R.L. Kumar A. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12213-12220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Our previous structural modeling (21Beard W.A. Minnick D.T. Wade C.L. Prasad R. Won R.L. Kumar A. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12213-12220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), undertaken in connection with the D76V mutant, suggested that Arg-78 interacts with the template nucleotide that base pairs with the nucleotide at the 3′ primer terminus. In view of this putative interaction of Arg-78 with the template and the possible effect on fidelity, we decided to generate and examine the accuracy of mutants with amino substitutions at this position. Recently, Huang et al. (25Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar) reported the structure of a catalytic complex of HIV RT with a DNA template-primer and a dNTP. Although generally similar to our model, the x-ray structure shows that Arg-78 interacts directly with Asp-76 and indirectly with the template nucleotide base paired to the incoming dNTP. This template nucleotide lies between the nucleotide that interacts with both Asp-76 and base pairs with the incoming dNTP and the nucleotide that interacts with both Glu-89 and base pairs to the penultimate primer nucleotide. We report here new HIV-1 RT variants with mutations at Arg-78 that exhibit increased fidelity and altered interactions with DNA and RNA templates. We interpret available evidence to indicate that interactions of Arg-78 with both Asp-76 and the template nucleotide base pairing with the incoming dNTP play important roles in HIV-1 RT infidelity. We suggest that interactions of these two residues with the template nucleotide may promote the formation of a mutagenic DNA polymerization active site, thereby contributing to a high rate of mutation during viral replication. E. coli NM522 (Stratagene) was used for construction of plasmids, and BL21 (Novagen) was used for over-expression of HIV-1 RT. pBK33 is pHis/NdeI (from Dr. A. Hizi) encoding full-length wild type p66 HIV-1 RT fused at the N terminus to six histidine residues (22Kim B. Hathaway T.R. Loeb L.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5831-5839Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). pBK44 is a pET28a (Novagen) derivative expressing wild type p51 HIV-1–1 RT fused at the N terminus to six histidine residues. pBK77 and pBK78 are pHis/NdeI constructs for expression of His-tagged p66 of wild type SIV RT that was derived from pSIVMNE170 (from Dr. J. T. Kimata, Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research, TX) and the R78A SIV RT mutant, respectively. Amino acid substitutions at Arg-78 of HIV-1 RT were generated by using PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis with Arg-78 primers (5′-CTTATTGAGCTCTCTGAANNNTACTAATTTTCTCCATTTAG-3′) that contained 100% random nucleotides (designated “N”) at the positions encoding residue 78. The products of PCR amplification with Arg-78 primer and SD-RT primer (5′-GAAGATCTAAGCTTAGGAGGTTGTCCCATATGCCCATTAGTCC-3′), which hybridizes to the N-terminal sequence of HIV-1 RT and theNdeI site, were inserted into pBK33 for p66 RT after digestion with BsrGI and SacI. A 126-base pair region between BsrGI and SacI of the plasmids expressing Asp-76 mutants was sequenced to confirm mutations at position 78. After sequencing the 126-base pair fragment inserts to verify the mutations at position 78 of RT, the 126-base pair fragments prepared from pBK33 of individual mutation constructs were cloned to pBK44 for p51 RT mutant proteins. The plasmids expressing His-tagged Arg-78 SIV RT mutants were constructed by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using two pieces of PCR products. One is the PCR product encoding the N-T part of SIV RT and an Arg-78 mutation that was amplified with SD-SIV RT (5′-TTTTTTAAGCTTGAAGGAGATATACATATGCCCATAGCTAAGGTAGAGCC-3′) and an Arg-78 reverse primer (5′-TTT TTTGAGCTCNNNAAAATCTATCAGTATTCTCC-3′) containing 100% randomized sequences at position Arg-78 (designated N) and a SacI site near position 79 of SIV RT. The other is the PCR product encoding the C-T part of the SIV RT that was amplified with a SIV-SacI forward primer (5′-TTTTTTGAGCTCAATAAGGTCACTCAG GAC-3′) containing a SacI site at position 79 and a SIV C-T primer (5′-TTTTTTGGATCCGTCGACTTAAACTTGTCTAATCCCTTG-3′). After digestion of N-T PCR by NdeI/SacI and C-T PCR bySacI/BamHI, these two digested DNAs were ligated to pHis/NdeI-digested NdeI and BamHI. For the expression plasmid for wild type SIV RT, the wild type SIV RT gene amplified from pSIVMNE170 by using SD SIV RT and SIV C-T primers (see the SIV C-T primer sequence above) was cloned to the pHis/NdeI plasmid after digestion with NdeI andBamHI. All SIV RT genes in these constructed expression plasmids were sequenced by ABI system. Procedures for purification of the hexahistidine-tagged p66 and p51 monomers of HIV-1 RT by Ni2+ chelation chromatography have been described; equi-molar amounts of separately purified p66 and p51 of HIV-1 RT were mixed prior to dialysis to form p66/p51 heterodimers (22Kim B. Hathaway T.R. Loeb L.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5831-5839Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23Kim B. Hathaway T.R. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4872-4878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Reconstructed p66/p51 heterodimers of wild type and Asp-76 mutant proteins were used for the fidelity assays described below. Amounts of purified monomers were estimated in the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) with a bovine serum albumin standard; all preparations were of >95% purity, estimated by visual inspection of Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. DNA- and RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities were determined as described (22Kim B. Hathaway T.R. Loeb L.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5831-5839Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar); the assays employed a gapped salmon sperm DNA template-primer, poly(rA)/oligo(dT) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), or an RNA template encoding the HIV-1 RT gene. Preparation of the RNA template is described below (see primer extension assay). We previously found that a 6 His tag of purified HIV-1 RT proteins does not affect DNA polymerase activity and sensitivity to a nucleotide analog (22Kim B. Hathaway T.R. Loeb L.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5831-5839Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We also found both p66/p51 heterodimers and p66/p66 homodimers of wild type and mutant HIV-1 RT proteins showed the same level of misinsertion in four different types of the primer extension reactions described below. The SIV RT p66 fragment was purified by following the purification protocol established for HIV-1 RT. With this protocol, we were able to purify 2 mg of SIV RT proteins with greater than 95% purity from a 1-liter culture. Procedures (22Kim B. Hathaway T.R. Loeb L.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5831-5839Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) were modified from those of Preston et al. (7Preston B.D. Poiesz B.J. Loeb L.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1168-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). The deoxyoligonucleotide template-primer was prepared by annealing a 63-mer (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGAAGCTTGGCTGCAGAATATTGCTAGCGGGAATTCGGCGCG-3′) to a 17-mer (5′-CGCGCCGAATTCCCGCT-3′)32P-labeled at the 5′-end with T4 polynucleotide kinase (template:primer, 2.5:1). Assay mixtures (20 μl) contained 10 nm template-primer, 5–50 nm HIV-1 RT or SIV RT as specified in figure legends, 3 or 4 dNTPs (250 μmeach), 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min and terminated by the addition of 5 μl of 40 mmEDTA, 99% formamide. Reaction products were immediately denatured by incubating at 95 °C for 3 min and analyzed by electrophoresis in 14% urea-polyacrylamide gels. The 1.6-kilonucleotide RNA template used in this assay contains the coding sequence of the HIV-1 RT gene and was synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase-catalyzed transcription of pBK8 (22Kim B. Hathaway T.R. Loeb L.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5831-5839Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), which encodes the HIV-1 RT gene between the HindIII andEcoRI sites of pBluescript (Stratagene). The transcribed RNA was purified by ethanol precipitation and annealed to a32P-labeled 21-mer (3305 RT primer (22Kim B. Hathaway T.R. Loeb L.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5831-5839Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)) complementary to nucleotides encoding amino acids 239–246 of HIV-1 RT. Reaction conditions were otherwise the same as described above. Extension products were resolved in 10% denaturing gels. The mutation frequencies for wild type and mutant HIV-1 RT were measured essentially as described previously (27Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). M13mp2 DNA containing a 361-nucleotide single-stranded gap was prepared as specified (27Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Gapped DNA (1 μg) was incubated with RT (200 nm) at 37 °C for 10 min under the conditions described below for the misinsertion assays. The extended gapped DNAs by RT proteins were analyzed by 0.7% agarose for checking the production of double strand M13 DNA with filled gaps (27Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The extended gapped DNAs were transformed to MC1016 cells, and the transformed cells were plated to M9 plates containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside with CSH50 lawn cells. The mutation frequency was determined as the ratio of mutant (pale blue and white) plaques to mutant plus wild type (dark blue) plaques as described (27Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The lacZa genes encoded in the M13 phage DNA prepared from mutant plaques were sequenced as described (27Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Binding constants (K d) of HIV-1 RT proteins to the 63-mer DNA template annealed to the 17-mer primer, and HIV-1 RNA template encoding the 1.7 kilonucleotide RT gene annealed to the 3305 template were measured as described (28Carroll S.S. Cowart M. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 804-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 29Patel P.H. Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Tantillo C. Clark Jr., A.D. Raag R. Nanni R.G. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5351-5363Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). HIV-1 RT proteins (20 nm) were preincubated with various concentrations of the template·primer complexes (T·P) used in the misinsertion assay (1, 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 60, 80, and 100 nm) for 3 min at 37 °C. Each of these T·P concentrations contains 1 nm32P-labeled template-primer. The extension reactions (total 20 μl) were initiated by adding a mixture of 0.5 mm dNTPs with 5 mm MgCl2 (final concentration) and a poly(rA)/oligo(dT) trap (4 μg/20μl), and after a 3-min incubation at 37 °C, the reactions were terminated by adding 4 μl of stop solution (90% formamide, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue). The terminated reactions were immediately incubated at 95 °C for 5 min. Under this reaction condition, RT extended the primers only once during the incubation. To confirm this single round of extension, two control reactions for each T·P concentration were performed. First, RT proteins were added to the mixture of the T·P of each concentration, poly(rA)/oligo(dT) trap and dNTPs, and the reactions continued for 3 min at 37 °C. In this condition the primer was not able to be extended because all RT molecules were successfully trapped by excess molar concentrations (4 μg/20 μl) of a poly(rA)/oligo(dT) trap. Second, the reactions without the trap showed the larger amount of the primer extended because of multiple rounds of replication. These two control experiments guaranteed the single round of extension reaction under our reaction condition. The extension reactions at different T·P concentrations were analyzed by 14 and 10% urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for DNA and RNA templates, respectively. The amounts of the extended and unextended primers at each T·P concentration were determined by phosphoimager analysis of the gel. The data were fitted to the equation described previously (28, 29; see Eq. 1 below), and theK d values for wild type, R78A, and D76V RT proteins were determined. E−T·P=0.5(Kd+Et+T·P)−0.5(Kd+Et+T·P)2−4EtT·PEquation 1 In Equation 1, E − T·P,K d, Et, and T·P indicate productive RT-template concentration, equilibrium dissociation constant for RT-template binding, total enzyme concentration, and total template·primer concentration, respectively. Reaction condition for measuring processivity also requires a single round of primer extension. The reaction condition for processivity assay was modified from the one used for K d measurement described above. Two concentrations of three RT proteins, wild type (10 and 20 nm), D76V (2.5 and 5 nm), and R78A (40 and 80 nm) HIV-1 RT proteins were used for RNA and DNA templates. RT proteins were preincubated with either 10 nm poly(rA) (average size, 260 nt, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) annealed to the32P-labeled 20-mer oligo(dT) or the M13mp18 single strand DNA (+) annealed to the 32P-labeled 24-mer forward primer (Stratagene) for 3 min at 37 °C. The extension reactions were initiated by adding the trap mixture containing dNTPs (0.5 mm with final concentration 5 mmMgCl2), poly(rA)/oligo(dT) (4 μg/20 μl), and heparin (10 μg/20 μl). The extension reactions were terminated by 2 μl of stop solution after a 3-min incubation at 37 °C. Under this condition, the primer was extended only once during the incubation as confirmed by the same two control reactions with or without the trap (see Fig. 4). The terminated processivity reaction and control reactions were analyzed by 10% urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after a 3-min heat inactivation. Eleven different amino acid substitutions at Arg-78 of HIV-1 RT were generated in both the p66 and p51 subunits by using PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. The hexahistidine-tagged, wild type and mutant monomers were overexpressed in E. coli and purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography. Heterodimers, formed by dialyzing equimolar quantities of separately purified p66 and p51 monomers, were used for the work described below. Specific activities of 8 of the 11 Arg-78 mutants (R78A, R78S, R78L, R78I, R78T, R78V, R78C, and R78G), measured on activated calf thymus DNA, ranged from 25 to 35% of the wild type. The remaining three mutants (R78Y, R78E, and R78P) exhibited much lower specific activities ranging from 5 to 10% of the wild type. In accord, specific activities of the Arg-78 mutants measured by using poly(rA) template annealed to oligo(dT) ranged at similar levels of the DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities. We first employed misinsertion assays to compare the misincorporation capability of wild type and R78A mutant HIV-1 RTs. This assay is a primer extension assay that monitors misinsertion by utilizing a synthetic DNA or RNA template-primer and biased dNTP pools containing only three kinds of dNTPs. A gel-displaying extension of the 17-mer primer annealed to a 63-mer DNA template by two quantities (4× and 1×) of wild type, and R78A HIV-1 heterodimer RT is shown in Fig.1 A. In this assay, the higher efficiency of primer extension will reflect the lower fidelity of the HIV-1 RT protein assayed. The specific activity of the purified R78A mutant, as determined with heterogeneous DNA and RNA templates, was approximately 30% of that of wild type RT. As shown in Fig.1 A, loaded with reactions containing all four dNTPs, the wild type and R78A mutant heterodimers catalyzed approximately the same amount of synthesis leading to fully extended primers. When incubated with mixtures of only 3 dNTPs (Fig. 1, B, −dTTP;C, −dCTP; D, −dGTP; E, −dATP), wild type HIV-1 RT catalyzed substantial extension past nucleotides for which a complementary dNTP was deleted (see the sites with anasterisk in Fig. 1) indicating utilization of incorrect nucleotides. On the other hand, the R78A mutant catalyzed less synthesis and shorter extension than the wild type enzyme in reactions with three dNTPs, indicative of higher replicational fidelity (Fig. 1,B–E). Interestingly, the R78A RT showed a larger reduction of the primer extension in the reactions with −TTP (B) and −dCTP (C) than in the reactions with −dGTP (D) and −dATP (E). Next, we performed the misinsertion assay with an RNA template encoding the positive strand of the HIV-1 RT gene sequence. In this reaction, like the first round of replication of HIV-1, RT proteins produce a negative strand of viral DNA encoding the RT regions where most of the RT drug-resistant mutations have been identified. We also employed AMV RT as a high fidelity control RT. In the presence of all dNTPs, wild type HIV-1 RT, R78A HIV-1 RT, and AMV RT proteins extended the primer up to 250 nt. Two equal quantities of RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity of three RT proteins showing the extension of the same 10 and 20% of total primer were determined by the reactions with all dNTPs (Fig. 2 A). As shown in Fig. 2, B −TTP; C, −dGTP; D,−dCTP; and E, −dATP, AMV RT showed less extended primer than wild type HIV-1 RT in the presence of only three dNTPs, confirming that AMV RT has a higher replicational accuracy than wild type HIV-1 RT (3Roberts J.D. Preston B.D. Johnston L.A. Soni A. Loeb L.A. Kunkel T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). AMV RT showed a larger reduction of the primer extension in the reactions with −TTP (B) and −dATP (E) than the reactions with −dGTP (C) and −dCTP (D). As seen in Fig. 2, B–E, the R78A mutant HIV-1 RT showed an even lower level of extended primer than AMV RT in the presence of three dNTPs. This result indicates that R78A HIV-1 RT could have enhanced fidelity. Interestingly, unlike AMV RT, R78A showed a larger reduction of the primer extension in the reactions with −dGTP (C) as well as the reactions with −TTP (B) and −dATP (E). Lik"

We show that deletion of the kinase subunitCTK1 results in an increase in phosphorylation of serine in position 5 (Ser5) of the CTD repeat (Tyr1-Ser2-Pro3-Thr4-Ser5-Pro6-Ser7) during logarithmic growth. This result indicates that CTDK-I negatively regulates CTD Ser5 phosphorylation. We also show thatCTK1 deletion (ctk1Δ) eliminates the transient increase in CTD serine 2 (Ser2) phosphorylation observed during the diauxic shift. This result suggests that CTDK-I may play a direct role in phosphorylating CTD Ser2 in response to nutrient depletion. Northern blot analysis was used to show that genes normally induced during the diauxic shift are not properly induced in a ctk1Δ strain. Glycogen synthase (GSY2) and cytosolic catalase (CTT1) mRNA levels increase about 10-fold in wild-type cells, but this increase is not observed in ctk1Δ cells suggesting that increased message levels may require Ser2 phosphorylation. Heat shock also induces Ser2 phosphorylation, but we show here that this change in CTD modification and an accompanying induction of heat shock gene expression is independent of CTDK-I. The observation that SSA3/SSA4 expression is increased in ctk1Δ cells grown at normal temperature suggests a possible role for CTDK-I in transcription repression. We discuss several possible positive and negative roles for CTDK-I in regulating CTD phosphorylation and gene expression.

Chem. 1999; 274: 7399-7404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Yeast CTDK-I is a Cdk-cyclin kinase that is closely related to P-TEFb, although whether these kinases perform the same function in vivo has not been determined. CTDK-I was isolated as a complex that specifically phosphorylates the CTD in vitro (34Lee J.M. Greenleaf A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3624-3628Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). CTDK-I is comprised of three subunits encoded by CTK1,CTK2, and CTK3 (35Sterner D.E. Lee J.M. Hardin S.E. Greenleaf A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5716-5724Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). CTK1 encodes a kinase catalytic subunit closely related to the P-TEFb Cdk9 subunit (29Zhu Y. Pe'ery T. Peng J. Ramanathan Y. Marshall N. Marshall T. Amendt B. Mathews M.B. Price D.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2622-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). The Ctk2 protein resembles cyclin T, whereas Ctk3 shows no homology to known proteins (35Sterner D.E. Lee J.M. Hardin S.E. Greenleaf A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5716-5724Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Like P-TEFb, CTDK-I has been shown to stimulate pol II elongation in vitro (36Lee J.M. Greenleaf A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10990-10993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This function is not essential, however, as deletion of any single or all of the genes encoding CTDK-I is not lethal in yeast (35Sterner D.E. Lee J.M. Hardin S.E. Greenleaf A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5716-5724Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 37Lee J.M. Greenleaf A.L. Gene Expr. 1991; 1: 149-167PubMed Google Scholar). CTDK-I-deficient strains grow more slowly than wild type at normal temperatures and are unable to grow at low temperature (35Sterner D.E. Lee J.M. Hardin S.E. Greenleaf A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5716-5724Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 37Lee J.M. Greenleaf A.L. Gene Expr. 1991; 1: 149-167PubMed Google Scholar) indicating that some cellular processes are impaired. Examining the phosphorylation state of the CTD in CTK1- deleted (ctk1Δ) cells initially indicated that the CTD was not phosphorylated in the normal fashion (37Lee J.M. Greenleaf A.L. Gene Expr. 1991; 1: 149-167PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, the abundance of a slower mobility form of the largest subunit (Rpb1p) was reduced suggesting that the CTD was under-phosphorylated. Reactivity with anti-phospho-CTD antiserum remained, however, suggesting the existence of multiple CTD kinasesin vivo. These studies did not address the identity of the sites phosphorylated by CTDK-I nor the sites that remain phosphorylated in its absence. Standard approaches to mapping in vivo CTD phosphorylation sites are impractical due to the repetitive nature of the amino acid sequence. Less direct in vitro approaches have yielded important information about potential phosphorylation sites. For example, we showed that both serine 2 (Ser2) and serine 5 (Ser5) of the consensus heptapeptide can be phosphorylatedin vitro by Cdc2 kinase (38Zhang J. Corden J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2290-2296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and mutation of these sites to alanine in the yeast CTD is lethal (12West M.L. Corden J.L. Genetics. 1995; 140: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together these results suggest that these serine residues act as phosphoacceptors for one or more CTD kinases in vivo. More recently, we mapped critical elements of the CTD phosphoepitopes recognized by a set of monoclonal antibodies (39Patturajan M. Schulte R.J. Sefton B.M. Berezney R. Vincent M. Bensaude O. Warren S.L. Corden J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4689-4694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). By using in vitro phosphorylated CTD fusion proteins, we showed that mAb H14 specifically binds CTDs phosphorylated at Ser5, whereas mAb H5 specifically binds CTD fusion proteins phosphorylated at Ser2. These antibodies bind in vivo phosphorylated CTD indicating that both Ser2 and Ser5 are phosphorylated in vivo. We further showed that Ser2 and Ser5 phosphorylation is independently regulated during yeast growth (39Patturajan M. Schulte R.J. Sefton B.M. Berezney R. Vincent M. Bensaude O. Warren S.L. Corden J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4689-4694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). We now extend the characterization of CTD phosphorylation by showing that deletion of CTK1 results in a profound increase in phosphorylation of Ser5. In addition, the increase in Ser2 phosphorylation previously observed during the diauxic shift is not observed in ctk1Δ cells. Taken together, these results suggest that CTDK-I participates in both positive and negative regulation of CTD phosphorylation. The strains used in this study are as follows: ADH6-1a (MAT a ctk1ΔE::HIS3 ura3-52 lys2-801 ade2-101 trp1-Δ1 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1); ADH6–1b (MATaCTK1 ura3-52 lys2-801 ade2-101 trp1-Δ1 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1); MCY3664 (MATα ctk1ΔE::ura3 ura3-52 trp1-Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1); MCY3661 (MATα CTK1 ura3-52 trp1-Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1) (35Sterner D.E.

Control cells were maintained at 30 °C for the same time. The heat shock was terminated by diluting the culture with ice-cold water, and cells were harvested by centrifugation and extracts prepared as described earlier (39Patturajan M. Schulte R.J.

Anti-JC20 antibodies were raised in rabbit against a nine amino acid peptide (MVGQQYSSA) corresponding to the amino terminus of the largest subunit (Rpb1p) of yeast pol II. These antibodies were subsequently affinity purified on a peptide column (Affi-Gel, Bio-Rad) and were used at a dilution of 1:200 for Western blot analysis. Anti-Ssa1p (42Bush G.L. Meyer D.I. J.

These antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:5000. Anti-Ssa3p,4p detects both Ssa3p and Ssa4p, and anti-Ssa1p recognizes all four Ssa proteins (42Bush G.L. Meyer D.I. J.

The wild-type CTK1 gene was amplified by PCR from a wild-type yeast genomic DNA template using primers starting 400 base pairs 5′ and 250 bases 3′ of the coding sequence. Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) was used in the amplification to minimize errors. The amplified gene was cloned into pRS415 (45Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to produce pRSCTK1. This plasmid was transformed (46Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1769) Google Scholar) into ctk1Δ yeast (ADH6-1a) and selected for growth on plates lacking leucine. The resulting transformants did not display the slow growth and cold-sensitive phenotypes of ctk1Δ cells indicating that a functional copy of CTK1 was cloned. Yeast extracts (50–100 μg of total protein) were prepared by grinding with glass beads as described previously (39Patturajan M. Schulte R.J. Sefton B.M. Berezney R. Vincent M. Bensaude O. Warren S.L.

Blots were probed with various antibodies, and the immunoreactive proteins were detected using either anti-mouse Ig (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or anti-mouse IgM (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) at a dilution of 1:3000. The reactive bands were illuminated using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total RNA from yeast cells were prepared by the standard acid phenol method (47Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E.

RNA (20 μg) was separated on formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred to nylon membrane (N+ Hybond paper, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots were hybridized with32P-RNA probes transcribed using T7 polymerase, and radioactive bands were detected using a PhosphorImager. The template DNA used in transcription reaction for making RNA probe was synthesized by PCR using yeast genomic DNA as template. Each downstream primer contains a T7 promoter sequence such that the PCR reaction can be used as template to synthesize the antisense probe. The primers used for the PCR are as follows: SSA4, 5′ GAATCAGCTA GAATCGTACG CG 3′ and 5′ TAATACGACT CACTATAGGG CCTCTTCAAC CGTTGGGCCG 3′; ENO1, 5′ GCTAGATCCG TCTACGACTC 3′ and 5′ TAATACGACT CACTATAGGG GTCACCGTGG TGGAAGTTTT′; GSY2, 5′ TCCCGTGACC TACAAAACCA 3′ and 5′ TAATACGACT CACTATAGGG TATTGGGGGT AACTGTCCCT 3′; CTT1, 5′ CCAATAAGAT CAATCAGCTC 3′ and 5′ TAATACGACT CACTATAGGG GGAGTATGGA CATCCCAAGT 3′; ACT1, 5′ GTAAAGCCGG TTTTGCCGGT 3′ and 5′ TAATACGACT CACTATAGGG GAAGCCAAGA TAGAACCACC 3′. The SSA4 probe also recognizes SSA3, and as the sizes of these two RNA are the same, we are unable to distinguish the two RNA in the Northern blot. Earlier studies showed that deletion of CTK1 results in an apparent decrease in CTD phosphorylation as determined by an increase in electrophoretic mobility of the largest subunit and a decreased reactivity with polyclonal antibodies raised against in vitro phosphorylated CTD (37Lee J.M. Greenleaf A.L. Gene Expr. 1991; 1: 149-167PubMed Google Scholar). However, this study did not address which of the known phosphoepitopes were affected. We have used a set of monoclonal antibodies that recognize different CTD phosphoepitopes to characterize the CTD phosphorylation patterns in ctk1Δ cells relative to wild-type cells. The antibodies employed include the following: mAb 8WG16 which recognizes unphosphorylated Ser2; mAb H5 which recognizes phosphorylated Ser2; and mAb H14 which recognizes phosphorylated Ser5 (39Patturajan M. Schulte R.J. Sefton B.M. Berezney R. Vincent M. Bensaude O. Warren S.L. Corden J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4689-4694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). These antibodies were used to examine the phosphorylation state of the CTD in total cell extracts prepared from growing yeast cells. The results presented in Fig.1 A clearly indicate an increase in the mAb H14-reactive epitope in the ctk1Δ strain suggesting an increase in Ser5 phosphorylation. In multiple experiments we have consistently observed a 3–5-fold increase in H14 reactivity when equal amount of protein is loaded. This increase in H14 reactivity is not due to an increase in the amount of pol II as determined from the reactivity of other pol II-specific antibodies. We also see a similar increase in mAb H14 reactivity in two other independently derived ctk1Δ strains MCY3664 (40Kuchin S. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1163-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and YJC1169 2M. Patturajan and J. L. Corden, unpublished data. indicating that the increase in H14 reactivity is not specific to the ADH6 background (35Sterner D.E. Lee J.M. Hardin S.E. Greenleaf A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5716-5724Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Consistent with an increase in CTD phosphorylation, we see a decrease in the mobility of Rpb1p detected with mAb 8WG16. This antibody recognizes the Ser2 site in unphosphorylated repeats. It thus reacts both with the hypo-phosphorylated IIa species of Rpb1p and with Rpb1p that is phosphorylated on some, but not all, repeats. The decrease in mobility of the 8WG16-reactive species observed in Fig.1 A is indicative of an increase in overall phosphorylation of the CTD. Taken together, the results presented in Fig. 1 A indicate that deletion of the CTK1 gene leads to an increase in serine 5 phosphorylation. Fig. 1 A also indicates a decrease in the mAb H5-reactive epitope in the ctk1Δ strain. In this figure we observe an approximately 2-fold reduction, but the magnitude of the decrease is dependent on growth state (see below). This result suggests that CTDK-I may be involved in phosphorylation of Ser2. To determine whether all of the RNA polymerase II is released from the cells during grinding with glass beads, we compared the protein in the cell extracts with protein remaining in the pellet containing cell debris. Fig. 1 B shows that the H14- and H5-reactive forms of pol II are completely extracted while some of the heat shock protein Ssa1p remains in the pellet. To control for the possibility that changes in CTD phosphorylation were due to secondary genetic changes in the ctk1Δ cells, we re-transformed these cells with a plasmid expressing wild-typeCTK1. In Fig. 1 C we see that this plasmid restores wild-type levels of reactivity with both mAb H14 and H5. Thus, the effects seen are specific to CTK1. We also observe a marked decrease in H5 reactivity in ctk1Δ cells in this experiment compared with the experiment shown in Fig. 1 A. In Fig.1 C the cells were grown in minimal media lacking leucine to select for the CTK1-containing plasmid. Growth in minimal media enhances the effect of ctk1Δ on the H5-reactive epitope. In our previous studies we showed that phosphorylation of different CTD phosphoacceptor sites is independently regulated. Both nutritional limitation and heat shock result in higher levels of Ser2 phosphorylation with little change in Ser5phosphorylation (39Patturajan M. Schulte R.J. Sefton B.M. Berezney R. Vincent M. Bensaude O. Warren S.L. Corden J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4689-4694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). To examine growth-related changes inctk1Δ cells, we made protein extracts from CTK1(ADH6–1a) and ctk1Δ (ADH6–1b) cells at different stages of growth. A typical growth curve was obtained from cells grown in rich media (Fig. 2 A). As described earlier (37Lee J.M. Greenleaf A.L. Gene Expr. 1991; 1: 149-167PubMed Google Scholar) ctk1Δ cultures display slow growth but eventually reach stationary phase. Fig. 2 B shows Western blots of protein extracts derived from the cultures described in Fig. 2 A. As we described earlier, there is a marked increase in reactivity with mAb H5 as cells approach stationary phase (39Patturajan M. Schulte R.J. Sefton B.M. Berezney R. Vincent M. Bensaude O. Warren S.L. Corden J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4689-4694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The timing of this increase coincides with the beginning of the “diauxic shift” that occurs upon depletion of glucose and involves major reprogramming of the pattern of gene expression (48DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3690) Google Scholar). This transient increase in mAb H5 reactivity is not seen in ctk1Δ cells when they reach the same point in the growth curve (Fig. 2 B). However, CTK1 deletion does not entirely eliminate Ser2 phosphorylation; some reactivity with mAb H5 remains, and this reactivity declines in a similar fashion as both wild-type and mutant cells enter stationary phase. As shown earlier in Fig. 1, there is a severalfold increase in reactivity with mAb H14 at time points prior to the beginning of stationary phase. This increase is not due to changes in the concentration of Rpb1p as can be seen from immunoreactivity with antibody raised against a peptide corresponding to the amino-terminal nine amino acids of Rpb1p (Anti-JC20). This antibody detects approximately the same amount of Rpb1p in CTK1 andctk1Δ cells at similar points in the growth curve. In both strains the total amount of pol II subunit declines as cells reach stationary phase, an observation consistent with the known reduction in overall transcription as cells approach stationary phase (49Werner-Washburne M. Braun E. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 383-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With both anti-JC20 and 8WG16 we observe an increase in the slower mobility form of Rpb1p in ctk1Δ cells. This is most obvious for 8WG16 where the reactive band in ctk1Δ cells is well above the 200-kDa marker, whereas that in the CTK1 cells is even with the marker. Antibody against heat shock protein Ssa1p was used to show that equal amounts of protein were extracted from cells at various points in the growth curve. The absence of inducible H5-reactive CTD epitope during diauxic shift in ctk1Δ cells suggests that this form of pol II may be involved in regulating genes that are induced in this phase of the growth cycle. We have examined expression of glycogen synthase encoded by the GSY2 gene (50Farkas I. Hardy T.A. Goebl M.G. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15602-15607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cytosolic catalase encoded by the CTT1 gene (51Bissinger P.H. Wieser R. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1309-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Both of these genes have been shown to be induced during the diauxic shift (48DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3690) Google Scholar). In Fig.3 we show that in wild-type cells, expression of GSY2 and CTT1 is induced early in the diauxic shift, decreases, and then gradually increases as cells reach stationary phase. In contrast, in ctk1Δ cells expression of neither GSY2 nor CTT1 is induced but rather gradually increases during growth with maximum expression reached after the diauxic shift. This maximum level is markedly lower than that seen in CTK1 cells during the diauxic shift. As we have previously shown, heat shock leads to an increase in the mAb H5-reactive CTD epitope (39Patturajan M. Schulte R.J. Sefton B.M. Berezney R. Vincent M. Bensaude O. Warren S.L. Corden J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4689-4694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In Fig.4 A we show that this same increase in mAb H5 reactivity is maintained in the ctk1Δ background. We also observe that induction of heat shock proteins Ssa3p and Ssa4p occurs in both the mutant and wild-type backgrounds. Together, these results indicate that CTDK-I is not required for the heat shock response. Interestingly, some expression of Ssa3p/Ssa4p is observed even in the absence of heat shock (Fig. 4 A), and Northern blot analysis (Fig. 4 B) confirms that SSA3/SSA4 transcripts are observed during growth at 30 °C only in thectk1Δ background. Thus, CTDK-I would appear to be involved in repression of heat shock gene expression under normal growth conditions. The effect of ctk1Δ on SSA4 expression is specific; ACT1 expression is unchanged in thectk1Δ background, whereas expression of ENO1, which has previously been shown to be sensitive to CTD truncation (52Meisels E. Gileadi O. Corden J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31255-31261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), is reduced. The pattern of CTD phosphorylation is a product of combined action of both CTD kinases and CTD phosphatases. Deleting a CTD kinase gene would be expected to upset the dynamic balance between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation and lead to changes in the CTD phosphorylation pattern. In the present study we have used anti-phospho-CTD monoclonal antibodies to show that deletion of CTK1 changes the pattern but does not eliminate phosphorylation of the yeast pol II CTD. This result is consistent with the existence of multiple CTD kinases. The changes we observe in the ctk1Δ background are in part dependent on growth state and suggest diverse roles for CTDK-I in regulation of CTD phosphorylation. The most unexpected result presented here is that the phosphorylation state of the CTD in logarithmically growing cells is increased in thectk1Δ background. This result suggests that CTDK-I plays a role in negatively regulating CTD phosphorylation during log phase growth. The log phase increase in CTD phosphorylation is specific for Ser5 with little change observed in Ser2phosphorylation. Both Cdk7 (Kin28) and Cdk8 (Srb 10) kinases have been shown to preferentially phosphorylate Ser5 (20Roy R. Adamczewski J.P. Seroz T. Vermeulen W. Tassan J.P. Schaeffer L. Nigg E.A. Hoeijmakers J.H.J.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). One possibility is that CTDK-I may negatively regulate one or both of these kinases, perhaps through phosphorylation. An alternative explanation for the increase in Ser5 phosphorylation inctk1Δ cells is that CTDK-I may positively regulate a CTD phosphatase. Fcp1 is the only known CTD phosphatase (58Archambault J. Chambers R.S. Kobor M.S. Ho Y. Cartier M. Bolotin D. Andrews B. Kane C.M. Greenblatt J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14300-14305Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 59Archambault J. Pan G. Dahmus G.K. Cartier M. Marshall N. Zhang S. Dahmus M.E. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27593-27601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), but it is not known if its activity is controlled by phosphorylation. In addition, we do not know whether Fcp1 phosphatase is selective for either phosphorylated Ser2, Ser5, or both. CTK1 deletion could also lead to an increase in Ser5 phosphorylation by a mechanism involving CTD phosphorylation. For example, if CTDK-I were to phosphorylate the CTD in such a fashion that the phosphoacceptors for other CTD kinases were blocked, then we would observe an increase in CTD phosphorylation uponCTK1 deletion. In this scenario CTDK-I would have to phosphorylate the CTD to low density, whereas CTD kinases that function in the absence of CTDK-I would need to phosphorylate the CTD to high density. We have previously shown that phosphorylation of Ser2 transiently increases late in logarithmic growth (39Patturajan M. Schulte R.J. Sefton B.M. Berezney R. Vincent M. Bensaude O. Warren S.L. Corden J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4689-4694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The timing of this change in CTD phosphorylation corresponds to the beginning of the diauxic shift that occurs when cells growing in glucose-based medium deplete the glucose and shift from fermentation to respiratory metabolism (60Werner-Washburne M. Braun E.L. Crawford M.E. Peck V.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In the present study we show that this increase in Ser2phosphorylation does not occur in ctk1Δ cells. The most straightforward explanation is that CTDK-I is responsible for phosphorylating Ser2 during the diauxic shift. We cannot, however, rule out less direct mechanisms in which CTDK-I may positively regulate an Ser2-specific kinase or negatively regulate an Ser2-specific phosphatase. Clearly, CTDK-I is not the only kinase capable of phosphorylating Ser2 as some reactivity with mAb H5 remains in the ctk1Δ strain, and this reactivity increases during heat shock. The diauxic shift is accompanied by widespread change in expression of genes involved in carbon metabolism, protein synthesis, and carbohydrate storage (48DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3690) Google Scholar, 60Werner-Washburne M. Braun E.L. Crawford M.E. Peck V.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Several classes of genes co-regulated during the diauxic shift were identified in a DNA microarray survey (48DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3690) Google Scholar). One particularly interesting group displays an average 10-fold increase in message levels during early diauxic shift. This class includes the predominantly expressed glycogen synthase geneGSY2 (50Farkas I. Hardy T.A. Goebl M.G. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15602-15607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the cytosolic catalase gene CTT1(51Bissinger P.H. Wieser R. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1309-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In this paper we show that the expression pattern forGSY2 and CTT1 in wild-type cells correlates with the expression of H5-reactive epitope. Maximum expression is observed during early diauxic shift, and steady-state levels of RNA decline as cells approach stationary phase. In contrast, in ctk1Δ cells GSY2 and CTT1 expression is not induced, and only modest increases are observed well after the diauxic shift. This is the first example of a gene that is dependent on CTDK-I for correct regulation. The similar timing of appearance of the H5-reactive epitope and the induction of GSY2 and CTT1 mRNA accumulation further suggests a possible role for Ser2 phosphorylation in the increase in steady-state mRNA levels observed during the diauxic shift. The results presented here suggest that CTDK-I is not a general elongation factor but rather functions in a gene-specific fashion. We have identified a class of yeast genes expressed in late log phase as potential targets of regulation. The absence of diauxic phase Ser2phosphorylation and the coincident failure to increase expression ofGSY2 and CTT1 suggest that expression of these genes is controlled through specific changes in phosphorylation of the CTD by CTDK-I. This is an apparently specific function of CTDK-I as heat shock-induced expression, which is also accompanied by an increase in Ser2 phosphorylation, is not affected by CTK1 deletion (Fig. 4). Our observations together with published observations about the role of CTDK-I in elongation favor a model in which Ser2phosphorylation regulates transcription elongation on specific genes. In this model CTDK-I is attracted to specific transcription complexes in response to regulatory signals. Phosphorylation of the CTD at Ser2 by CTDK-I either at the time of promoter clearance or later in elongation establishes an efficient transcription elongation complex leading to accumulation of mRNA. Involvement of CTDK-I could be triggered by factors bound at the promoter or by cis elements present in the transcribed regions of responsive genes. The promoters of GSY2 and CTT1 share several cis-acting promoter elements including the stress response element (61Ruis H. Schuller C. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 959-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). If factors that bind to the promoter in response to impending glucose depletion can attract CTDK-I, the ensuing CTD phosphorylation could allow for more efficient clearance from the promoter. This may involve breaking contacts between the CTD and components of the preinitiation complex or could be due to the establishment of contacts between the newly phosphorylated CTD and components of the elongation complex. Alternatively, genes regulated by CTDK-I at the diauxic shift may share common cis-acting RNA elements similar to the human immunodeficiency virus transactivation-responsive region RNA (TAR) site. TAR binds the activator Tat which in turn recruits P-TEFb which is thought to phosphorylate the CTD leading to productive elongation (30Mancebo H.S.Y. Lee G. Flygare J. Tomassini J. Luu P. Zhu Y.

Whether such cis-acting elements are present in yeast diauxic-specific genes is not known. The results presented here show that CTDK-I plays both positive and negative roles in CTD phosphorylation. In the absence of CTDK-I activity the phosphorylation of Ser5 during logarithmic growth increases, but the diauxic phase mAb H5-reactive species is reduced. The coincident lack of accumulation of GSY2 and CTT1 mRNAs at the diauxic shift suggests that these genes are regulated by the H5-reactive form of pol II.

A large body of evidence for many G protein-coupled receptors supports the contention that phosphorylated receptors are translocated into the cytosol through binding of arrestin to the phosphorylated receptor.

Freedman N.J. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23735-23738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Moro O. Shockley M.S. Lameh J. Sadee W. J. Bio.

However, few studies have directly addressed the involvement of receptor phosphorylation in the down-regulation of opioid receptors. In the case of the δ opioid receptor, deletion of the carboxyl tail of receptor expressed in CHO cells completely abolished receptor down-regulation, suggesting that the carboxyl tail is the necessary structural determinant for δ opioid receptor down-regulation (15Trapaidze N.

In contrast to this study, the same δ opioid receptor deletion mutant expressed in HEK 293 cells showed the identical degree of receptor internalization compared with the wild type δ opioid receptor in the absence of any detectable phosphorylation, suggesting that phosphorylation of G protein-coupled receptors may not be an absolute requirement for receptor internalization (17Murray S.R. Evans C.J. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24987-24991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In the case of the μ opioid receptor (MOR), the reduction of total membrane receptors appears to be the major mechanism for functional desensitization of the MOR (7Pak Y. Kouvelas A. Scheideler M.A. Rasmussen J. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1214-1222PubMed Google Scholar, 9Pak Y. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24961-24965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we and others have reported that the structural determinants necessary for agonist-induced MOR desensitization are Thr394 and its preceding acidic amino acid stretch (6Koch T. Schulz S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 24961-24965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Thus, in present study, we examined the further functional roles of these amino acid residues in the carboxyl tail to establish the structural determinants mediating MOR down-regulation. The full-length cDNA for the rat MOR was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pRC/CMV (InVitrogen, San Diego, CA). This construct was used as a template for mutagenesis and for subsequent stable transfection of the wild type and mutant receptor cDNAs into CHO cell lines. Mutant MORs such as T394A, T/S363–383A (AT), T/S363–379AT (ATT) (see Fig. 1), and 4YF (Y87F, Y92F, Y165F, and Y336F) (see Fig. 5 B) were constructed by substituting single or multiple amino acid residues. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a polymerase chain reaction-based technique as described (18Liggett S.B. Ostrowski J. Chesnut L.C. Kurose H. Raymond J.R. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4740-4746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, oligonucleotide primers corresponding to unique Eco47III/ApaI restriction sites (located at amino acids 304–305 and at 3′-region of vector, respectively) orNotI (located at the 5′-region of vector)/Eco47III were utilized in combination with two mutagenic primers. Polymerase chain reaction fragments were digested with unique restriction enzymes and subcloned into the corresponding restriction sites of the pRC/CMV encoding a MOR construct. All mutations were verified by dideoxy sequencing. For stable expression, the cell line CHO K-1 (number CCL61; American Type Culture Collection) was grown to 60% confluency in a 100-mm dish and subsequently transfected with wild type or mutant constructs in pRC/CMV vector using a calcium phosphate transfection kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Stable transfectants were selected in 1 mg/ml geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and clones with the appropriate expression level were screened by radioligand binding assay. 30–90 clones expressing varying numbers of receptors were screened to select those with comparable expression levels.Figure 5Detection of MOR tyrosine phosphorylation upon receptor activation and direct involvement of tyrosine residues on receptor down-regulation. A, untransfected CHO cells and CHO cells stably expressing MOR were incubated in the absence and presence of 1 μm DAMGO for 1 h and subsequently lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-MOR antibody. The immunopurified proteins were separated by 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and tyrosine-phosphorylated protein was detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The upper panel and lower panel (immunoprecipitated (i.p.) and immunoblotted (i.b.)) show untranfected (UT) CHO (lanes 1 and 4), MOR transfected untreated with DAMGO (lanes 2 and5), and MOR transfected, DAMGO-treated (lanes 3and 6) membranes.

The numbers above denote the tyrosine position in the receptor protein, and the intracellular loops and carboxyl tail are indicated as IC and CT, respectively. C, agonist-induced down-regulation of tyrosine substituted mutant receptor (4YF). CHO cells expressing the 4YF mutant receptor were incubated in the absence and presence of 1 μm DAMGO for 1 h, and subsequently saturation binding was done using [3H]naloxone. CHO cells expressing the 4YF were also incubated with 1 μg/ml pertussis toxin for 24 h and further incubated for 1 h in the absence and presence of 1 μm DAMGO, and membranes were assayed for saturation binding. The percentages of DAMGO-induced receptor down-regulation are presented as the means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. Significant difference from wild type is denoted by anasterisk (p < 0.05), and the double asterisks indicate significant difference from 4YF (p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) CHO cells expressing wild type or mutant MORs at confluent monolayer were treated with either medium alone or 1 μm DAMGO (final concentration) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Incubation was terminated by washing plates three times with 12 ml of ice-cold PBS. Membranes were prepared as described above. Adenylyl cyclase assays were conducted essentially as described previously (9Pak Y. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24961-24965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The assay mix contained 20 μl of membrane suspension (15–20 μg of protein), 12 μm ATP, 0.1 mmcAMP, 53 μm GTP, 2.7 mm phosphoenopyruvate, 0.2 unit of pyruvate kinase, 1 unit of myokinase, and 0.13 μCi of [32P]ATP in a final volume of 50 μl. Enzyme activities were determined in triplicate assay tubes containing increasing concentrations (10−11–10−3m) of DAMGO with 10 μm forskolin. Adenylyl cyclase activity was also measured in the presence of buffer alone (basal) or forskolin alone and incubated at 27 °C for 20 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 1 ml of an ice-cold solution containing 0.4 mm ATP, 0.3 mm cAMP, and [3H]cAMP (25,000 cpm). [32P]cAMP and [3H]cAMP were isolated by sequential column chromatography using Dowex cation exchange and aluminum oxide columns. The amount of [3H]cAMP was used to quantify individual column recovery. Data were analyzed by nonlinear least squares regression. Cells were grown until apparent confluence and then washed twice with 12 ml of ice-cold PBS, harvested, and centrifuged at 100 × gfor 10 min. Cells were then lysed in hypotonic buffer (5 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 2 mm EDTA, containing a protease inhibitor mixture of 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 5 mg/ml benzamidine) with a polytron homogenizer (Brinkman Instruments, Westbury, NY) for two 30-s bursts at the 5.5 setting. The lysate was then centrifuged at 100 × gfor 10 min to pellet unbroken cells and nuclei. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA with the protease inhibitor mixture and used immediately for radioligand binding studies. Protein content was determined according to the method of Bradford (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). For saturation experiments, cell membranes (20–30 μg of protein/tube) were incubated with increasing concentrations of [3H]naloxone (specific activity, 58.5 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) in a total volume of 1 ml. Specific binding was determined by calculating the difference in binding of the radiolabeled ligand in the absence and presence of the μ-selective antagonist naltrexone (10 μm). Competition experiments were performed using [3H]naloxone at approximately its K dvalue and competing cold drug, DAMGO, at concentrations ranging from 10−11 to 10−4m. After 2 h of incubation at room temperature, bound ligand was isolated by rapid filtration through a 48-well cell harvester (Brandel, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) onto GF/C Whatman filters. Filters were washed with 10 ml of ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and placed in glass vials with 5 ml of scintillation fluid (Cytoscint; ICN, Costa, Mesa, CA) and counted for tritium. All experiments were performed in duplicate, and each experiment was repeated at least three times. To cause the down-regulation of receptors, CHO cells expressing wild type or mutant MOR at confluent monolayer were treated with either medium alone or 1 μm DAMGO (final concentration) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. To study the down-regulation of receptors, cells were pretreated with different kinase inhibitors for 15 min before adding 1 μm DAMGO, and treatment was continued through the incubation with DAMGO. Pertussis toxin (1 μg/ml) was incubated for 24 h before treating with 1 μm DAMGO. Incubation was terminated by washing plates three times with 12 ml of ice-cold PBS. Membranes were prepared as described above and subjected to the binding assays. Three 100-mm dishes of CHO cells were used for each of three groups: untransfected CHO, untreated MOR, and MOR treated with 1 μm DAMGO for 1 h. After treatment, each group of cells was washed three times with ice-cold PBS and lysed with Nonidet P-40 buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium pervanadate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mg/ml leupeptin, 10 mg/ml soybean trypsin, and 10 mg/ml benzamide in PBS buffer) for 20 min. Supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 150,000 ×g for 15 min, assayed for protein concentration by the Bradford method (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), and precleared by 100 μl of presoaked protein A-agarose beads (Upstate Biotech, Lake Placid, NY). For immunoprecipitation, 1 ml of the precleared supernatant was incubated for 2 h with an antiserum (1:500) directed against 18 amino acids of the proximal carboxyl tail of MOR, and further incubated with 60 μl of the bead slurry for 2 h. Beads were washed five times by resuspension with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 buffer followed by microcentrifugation, and immunoprecipitated proteins were dissociated from beads by extraction with 60 μl of SDS-polyacrylamide gel loading buffer (4% SDS, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% glycerol, 0.5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.005% bromphenol blue). 150 μl of the immunoprecipitated protein were separated on 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gels with prestained protein marker (Helixx Technologies, San Diego, CA). The proteins on the gel were subsequently electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). After blocking with 10% milk, proteins were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine (Upstate Biotech) according to the manufacturer's recommendation or detected with MOR antibody (1:5000) by immunoprecipitation. Tyrosine phosphorylated proteins were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and precipitated MORs were also visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody detection (1:3000). The binding data from saturation and competition experiments were fit by nonlinear least squares regression using the data analysis program LIGAND (20Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar). Data from multiple experiments were averaged and expressed as the means ± S.E. The results were considered significantly different when the probability of randomly obtaining a mean difference was <0.05 using the paired Student's t test. We have previously reported that the MOR is desensitized after 1 h of treatment with an agonist, 1 μm DAMGO (7Pak Y. Kouvelas A. Scheideler M.A. Rasmussen J. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1214-1222PubMed Google Scholar). The underlying mechanism of this agonist-induced form of desensitization is likely phosphorylation of MOR, because mutation of a potential GRK phosphorylation site, Thr394 in the carboxyl tail of MOR, completely abolished agonist-induced desensitization (9Pak Y. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24961-24965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). During 1 h of DAMGO exposure, the absolute number of MOR in the high affinity state was reduced, resulting from a reduction in total membrane receptors, and this seemed to be the major mechanism causing functional desensitizaton (7Pak Y. Kouvelas A. Scheideler M.A. Rasmussen J. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1214-1222PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we have investigated the possible role of specific carboxyl tail residues including GRK-dependent phosphorylation sites in MOR down-regulation (Fig. 1). With wild type MOR, [3H]naloxone competition by DAMGO following exposure to agonist for 1 h showed that the total number of receptors was decreased by 34 ± 1.6% (n = 6) compared with that of untreated membranes (Fig.2 A). The proportion of receptors in the agonist-detected high affinity state and in low affinity state (Table I) remained unchanged following treatment with DAMGO, suggesting that prolonged exposure of agonist did not affect the coupling of wild type MOR to G protein (Fig. 2 B). We tested the involvement of Thr394 and the proximal 7 serine/threonine amino acid residues in agonist-induced MOR down-regulation. Interestingly, none of these mutations resulted in complete abolishment of receptor down-regulation, even though only the T394A mutant receptor showed complete inhibition of DAMGO-induced desensitization. However, compared with wild type receptor, T394A mutant receptors were down-regulated to a lesser extent following agonist exposure; 34 ± 1.6% (n = 6) for wild type, 14.8 ± 3.19% (n = 8) for the T394A receptor (Fig. 2 A). The AT mutant receptor (Fig. 1) showed desensitization of DAMGO inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation after 1 h of agonist treatment, with maximal inhibition that was only 70% of that observed with wild type receptor (9Pak Y. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24961-24965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This mutant receptor also showed down-regulation of receptor by 21.7 ± 1.95% (n = 4), which was 64% of wild type MOR down-regulation (p< 0.05) (Fig. 2 A). The ATT mutant (Fig. 1) showed an identical degree of desensitization compared with wild type receptor (9Pak Y. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24961-24965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This mutant receptor also showed an identical degree of receptor down-regulation (29.9 ± 0.2%, n = 3,p > 0.05) compared with the wild type receptor (Fig.2 A). Down-regulation of the AT and ATT mutant receptors were significantly different from each other (p < 0.05), suggesting that these receptors differing by a single amino acid demonstrated differential capabilities of agonist-induced down-regulation. However, these mutations did not affect agonist affinity or proportion of receptors in the high affinity and the low affinity states (Table I) compared with wild type receptor, just as shown for the T394A mutant (Fig. 2 C), indicating that the properties of G protein coupling were identical to that of wild type MOR. These data imply that the mutated residues in the carboxyl tail of MOR are not involved in G protein coupling but may serve as site(s) regulating down-regulation and desensitization. Furthermore, all mutant receptors displayed the identical degree of agonist-mediated maximal inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity and also similar IC50 values (Table II), indicating that the mutant receptors retained the ability to stimulate the adenylyl cyclase effector system through normal G protein activation, even though they differed with respect to receptor down-regulation (Fig. 2 A). This strongly suggests that MOR down-regulation is independent of G protein activation.Table IBinding parameters for the stably transfected wild type or mutant μ opioid receptors[3H]Naloxone[3H]Naloxone/DAMGOKHKLRHRLnmnm%%Wild typeB max2.9 ± 0.5 pmol/mg3.9 ± 0.7305 ± 4768 ± 232 ± 2K d1.1 ± 0.1 nmT394AB max1.5 ± 0.1 pmol/mg3.2 ± 0.5326 ± 8376 ± 124 ± 1K d1.0 ± 0.3 nmATB max4.3 ± 0.3 pmol/mg4.9 ± 1.3379 ± 10267 ± 133 ± 1K d1.0 ± 0.1 nmATTB max4.0 ± 0.1 pmol/mg4.9 ± 1.2354 ± 3270 ± 130 ± 1K d1.0 ± 0.1 nm4YFB max0.17 ± 0.02 pmol/mg6.0 ± 5.7100 ± 6836 ± 463 ± 4K d1.9 ± 0.2 nmK H, and K L, K ivalues of the high (H) and low (L) affinity states;R H and R L, proportions of receptor in high (H) and low (L) affinity states.

To determine the involvement of G protein activation in MOR down-regulation, CHO cells expressing wild type MOR were treated with 1 μg/ml of pertussis toxin for 24 h to uncouple the receptor from G proteins. Membranes treated with pertussis toxin were then exposed to DAMGO for 1 h. Pertussis toxin treatment resulted in a complete loss of the agonist detected high affinity state, with receptor existing in a single low affinity, indicating complete uncoupling from G protein (Fig. 3 A). However, DAMGO-induced down-regulation of MOR still occurred after pertussis toxin treatment. The down-regulation of MOR by agonist following pertussis toxin treatment was confirmed by Scatchard analysis of [3H]naloxone saturation isotherms (Fig. 3 A,inset). The reduction of cell surface receptors by DAMGO in pertussis toxin treated membranes was 21.65 ± 3.75% (n = 3) of that observed with pertussis toxin treatment alone (Fig. 3 B). This degree of down-regulation was significantly different from wild type MOR (34 ± 1.6%n = 6) but not different from the T394A mutant receptor down-regulation (14.8 ± 3.2, n = 8) (Fig.3 B). Therefore, agonist-induced MOR down-regulation was reduced by 40% with pertussis toxin treatment, indicating partial dependence on G protein activation. However, the residual MOR down-regulation unaffected by pertussis toxin treatment was therefore clearly independent of G protein activation. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that MOR down-regulation, which is partially blocked by the T394A mutation, may be dependent on G protein activation and GRK-dependent phosphorylation, whereas the residual down-regulation seen in the T394A mutant or after pertussis toxin treatment may be independent from G protein activation and, further, independent from GRK-dependent phosphorylation. This led us to test the possibility that the agonist may induce MOR down-regulation through activation of protein kinases other than GRKs. To determine the identity of the kinases involved in G protein-independent receptor down-regulation, we used a panel of kinase activators and inhibitors. Because there are several reports of the possible role of PKA or PKC on receptor phosphorylation (4Chen Y. Yu L. J. Bio.

The overall structure of the complex is similar to that reported in a previous article dealing with the Fab fragment-HEL complex (PDB ID code, 3HFM). However, the areas of Fv covered by HEL upon complex formation increased by about 100 Å2 in comparison with the Fab-HEL complex, and two local structural differences were observed in the heavy chain of the variable region (VH). In addition, small but significant local structural changes were observed in the antigen, HEL. The x-ray data permitted the identification of two water molecules between the VH and HEL and six water molecules retained in the interface between the antigen and the light chain complementarity determining regions (CDRs) 2 and 3 (CDR-L2 and CDR-L3). These water molecules bridge the antigen-antibody interface through hydrogen bond formation in the VL-HEL interface. Eleven water molecules were found to complete the imperfect VH-VL interface, suggesting that solvent molecules mediate the stabilization of interaction between variable regions. These results suggest that the unfavorable effect of deletion of constant regions on the antigen-antibody interaction is compensated by an increase in favorable interactions, including structural changes in the antigen-antibody interface and solvent-mediated hydrogen bond formation upon complex formation, which may lead to a minimum decreased affinity of the antibody Fv fragment toward its antigen.

Recent advances in genetic engineering have made it possible to prepare antibody fragments (Fab and Fv)1 using a bacterial expression system (3Skerra A. Curr. Opin.

It is known that antibodies recognize their target antigens with their variable domains, and fragments of variable regions can also bind to their targets specifically. However, antibodies have constant domains both in heavy and light chains. Fab molecules, which are the fragments of antibody molecules, are composed of two polypeptide chains (light and heavy), each of which folds into two domains (variable and constant). Fv molecules, which are heterodimers consisting of light and heavy chain variable domains (VL and VH) of antibodies, can exhibit antigen binding specificity and affinity similar to that of Fab fragments (3Skerra A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1993; 5: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 4Huston J.S. Margolies M.N. Haber E. Adv.

It is believed that the binding properties of Fv and Fab are identical to those of IgG.

Gene. 1993; 129: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and the interaction between the antigen and Fv has been investigated intensively using titration calorimetry in combination with site-directed mutagenesis (13Tsumoto K.

We have also reported that the association between VH and VL of the Fv is significantly stabilized in the presence of antigen HEL, and these structural characteristics can be applied to the novel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method for detection of the antigen (16Ueda H.

We also applied these characteristics to the selection method for a mutant Fv with a desired property from the library of mutant Fvs (17Tsumoto K. Nishimiya Y. Kasai N. Ueda H. Nagamune T.

The accurate structural information of a bacterially expressed Fv fragment of HyHEL-10 complexed with hen egg white lysozyme is crucial for a more precise discussion of molecular-recognition mechanisms and structural features of the Fv. Here we report the x-ray crystal structure of the antibody Fv fragment of HyHEL-10, complexed with its antigen HEL, with a resolution of 2.3 Å. The high resolution of the structure permits a detailed description of antibody-combining sites, including water molecules retained in the interface. On the basis of the crystal structure of the HyHEL-10 Fv-HEL complex reported here, the antigen-recognition mechanism of the Fv fragment will be discussed. Preparation of the Fv fragment of anti hen egg white lysozyme was carried out according to the published method (12Ueda Y. Tsumoto K. Watanabe K. Kumagai I. Gene. 1993; 129: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The purified Fv fragment was concentrated to 0.45 mm using an ultrafiltration membrane Centriprep-10 (Amicon, Tokyo, Japan) performed at 3000 × g. The antigen HEL, which was purchased from Seikagaku-kogyo Inc. (Tokyo, Japan), was dissolved in water at a concentration of 0.54 mm (1.2 times the molarity of the Fv solution). The HyHEL-10 Fv fragment-HEL complex to be crystallized was obtained by mixing an equal volume of the solution of the Fv fragment with the HEL solution. A hanging drop vapor diffusion method (18McPherson A Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 189: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) was applied for the crystallization procedure at 20 °C. The droplet size was 10 μl, comprising the same volume of the complex and reservoir solution, which was 0.7 ml. The first screening of the crystallization conditions was attempted according to the sparse matrix sampling method (19Jancarik J. Kim S.H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 26: 795-800Google Scholar). The crystals appeared under several conditions and were refined by varying the pH of the buffers and the concentration of the precipitants. The best crystals of the Fv-HEL complex were grown from 100 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.6–7.8), 9–11% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000, and 7–9% (w/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. They were elongated, bipyramidal crystals, 0.5 × 0.5 × 1.5 mm in size. The radiation was focused on a detector by the use of a two-bended-mirror system. All crystallographic data were collected on a diffractometer DIP-2000 (MAC Science, Yokohama, Japan) with the imaging plate of 200 mm φ as a detector using CuKα radiation generated at 50 kV and 90 mA, and processed with the HKL programs DENZO (20Otwinowski Z Proc. CCP4 Study Weekend. 1991; : 80-86Google Scholar), SCALA (21Evans P.R. Proc. CCP4 Study Weekend. 1993; : 114-122Google Scholar), and AGROVATA (22Acta Crystallogr. 1994; D 50 (Collaborative Computational Project, No. 4): 760-763Google Scholar) in the CCP4 suite (23Fox G.C. Holmes K.C. Acta Crystallogr. 1966; A 20: 886-891Crossref Google Scholar). The crystal belongs to the tetragonal space group P41212 or P43212 with unit-cell dimensions ofa = b = 57.2 Å and c = 237.0 Å. Because the crystal is estimated to contain one complex per asymmetric unit, the values for the V m (24Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7894) Google Scholar) and the solvent content were calculated to be 2.4 Å3·Da−1 and 49%, respectively. Although this crystal diffracted x-rays up to a 1.7-Å resolution limit, all diffraction data within 2.3 Å were collected with a crystal imaging plate distance of 120 mm to obtain separated spots, because of the large cell constant for the c axis. The intensity data consisted of 18,301 independent reflections from a total of 146,870 measurements (redundancy factor, 8.0). The crystallographic data and the statistics of the data collection are summarized in TableI.Table ICrystallographic dataSpace groupP41212Unit cell dimensionsa = b = 57.0 Å, c = 236.1 Åα = β = γ = 90°V M(Z)2.4 (Z = 8)Wave length1.5418 ÅResolution2.3 ÅR mergeaR merge = ∑hkl‖I − 〈I〉‖/∑hkl〈I〉.0.076 (0.265)Completeness (%)98.5 (97.6)Multiplicity8.08Resolution range8 − 2.3 ÅR-factor1-bR-factor = ∑∥Fobs‖−‖Fcalc∥/∑‖Fobs‖.0.175FreeR-factor0.235r.m.s. deviation bond length (Å)0.02r.m.s. deviation bonds angle (°)2.5Water molecules125a R merge = ∑hkl‖I − 〈I〉‖/∑hkl〈I〉.b R-factor = ∑∥Fobs‖−‖Fcalc∥/∑‖Fobs‖. Open table in a new tab The structure of HEL-Fv was determined by a molecular replacement method with the program AMoRe (25Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Ser. D. 1994; 50: 805-812Crossref Google Scholar) in the CCP4 package. The model coordinates that correspond to the HEL and Fv fragment were derived from the complex structure of HEL and the Fab fragment of HyHEL-10 (11Padlan E.A. Silverton E.W. Sheriff S. Cohen G.H. Smith-Gill S.J. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5938-5942Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) (PDB ID code, 3HFM). A rotation search using reflections having a resolution between 8.0 and 4.0 Å showed two major solutions, and both of them had the same scores of 7.3ς. These two solutions were subjected to a translation search, and one of the solutions showed a lower R-factor (0.375) than the other (0.394); the former solution was used for further refinement. The choice of the ambiguous space group was confirmed to be P41212 by comparison with the result of the translation search at the enantiomorph space group P43212, which indicated a higher R-factor (0.485). Refinements of the structure of the HEL-Fv complex were carried out with the programs XPLOR (26Brünger A.T. Kuriyan J. Karplus M. Science. 1987; 235: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (2125) Google Scholar) and REFMAC (27Murshudov G.N. Dodson E.J. Vagin A.A. Proc. CCP4 Study Weekend. 1996; : 93-104Google Scholar). Reflection data chosen randomly from 5.0% of the observed data were used for the calculation of the free R-factor (28Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Manual. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar), although they were not used for the refinement calculations. TheR- and free R-factors were monitored as the indexes of the accuracy of the model. The structure of the solution by the molecular-replacement method was refined as a rigid body using the reflections having a resolution between 8.0 and 3.0 Å, showing anR-factor of 0.380 with a free R-factor of 0.398. This model was then refined with XPLOR by a simulated annealing method with an initial temperature of 3000 K. The intensity data were expanded stepwise from a resolution limit of 3.0–2.3 Å in the refinements. After several cycles of refinement, the R-factor was reduced to 0.244 with a free R-factor of 0.313. At this stage, the model was corrected manually by inspection of ςA weighted 2 m‖Fobs‖-D‖Fcalc‖ and m‖Fobs‖-D‖Fcalc‖ D maps (29Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Ser. A. 1986; 46: 900-912Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The graphic program O (30Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Ser. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar) was used for the adjustment of the molecular model. After several iterations of positional refinements with REFMAC and correction by hand, water molecules were introduced gradually. The final model has 2861 nonhydrogen atoms, corresponding to 114 residues from Asp-1 to Ala-114 of the VH chain, 107 residues from Asp-1 to Lys-107 of the VL chain, 129 residues from Lys-1 to Leu-129 of HEL, and 125 water molecules. The final R- and freeR-factors were 0.175 and 0.235, respectively. The atomic parameters of the HEL-Fv complex were deposited in the PDB (ID code1c08). Fig. 1shows a ςA weighted 2 m‖Fobs‖-D‖Fcalc‖ electron density map of a part of the CDR, imposed on the refined model. A water molecule (W1) forms hydrogen bonds with the side chain of both the VL chain and HEL. In this region, the water molecule hydrates to -OHs of Tyr-96 and Ser-91 of VL (numbering of Kabat et al. (31Kabat E.A. Wu T.T. Perry H.M. Gottesman K.S. Foeller C. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest. Ed. 5. United States Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, NIH Publication No. 91-3242, 1991Google Scholar)), and -OH of Tyr-20, -NH1 of Arg-21, and -OH of Ser-100 of HEL. The torsion angles of the main chain atoms were analyzed in a Ramachandran plot (32Ramachandran G.N. Sasisekharan V. Adv. Protein Chem. 1968; 23: 283-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar) produced by the program PROCHECK (33Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) (data not shown). Most residues fell into the most-favored and the additional allowed regions. One residue fell in the disallowed region: Ala-51 in VL (designated LAla-51). This was well placed in density with a clear choice for its side chain and the preceding and following carbonyl O atoms. As a consequence of the ϕ and ψ angles at LAla-51, the conformation of CDR-L2 is a class 3 γ-turn (34Milner-White E.J. Ross B.M. Ismail R. Belhadj-Mostefa K. Poet R. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 777-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This conformation is also found in CDR-L2 of the D44.1-lysozyme complex (35Braden B.C. Souchon H. Eisele J.-L. Bentley G.A. Bhat T.N. Navaza J. Poljak R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 767-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), the NC10-neuraminidase complex (36Tulip W.R. Varghese J.N. Laver W.G. Webster R.G. Colman P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 122-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), and the NC41-neuraminidase complex (37Malby R.L. Tulip W.R. Harley V.R. McKimm-Breschkin J.L. Laver W.G. Webster R.G. Colman P.M. Structure. 1994; 2: 733-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The standard deviation of the coordinates is estimated to be 0.25 Å by a Luzzati Plot (38Luzzati A. Acta Crystallogr. 1952; 5: 802-810Crossref Google Scholar) (result not shown). The average value of the B-factor is 28.3 Å2 for the protein atoms, 36.6 Å2 for the oxygen atoms of the water molecules, and 28.2 Å2 for all atoms in the complex, which is comparable with that of the intensity data derived from the Wilson plot (39Wilson A.J.C. Acta Crystallogr. 1950; 3: 397-398Crossref Google Scholar). The packing of the Fv-HEL complex in the crystal lattice was found to be one complex in an asymmetric unit. Some residues exist that have intermolecular contact within 4.0 Å of the adjacent molecules. These interactions involve neither of the residues located in the CDRs of the Fv fragment, nor any of the epitope residues in HEL. Fig. 2 shows a schematic model of the HyHEL-10 Fv-HEL complex. An assignment of the secondary structure was made with the program PROCHECK (33Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) using the criteria of Kabsch (40Kabasch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1988; 21: 916-924Crossref Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). Both the VH chain and the VL chain making up the Fv fragment are superimposed on the Fv portion of the Fab fragment, which was determined in the HyHEL-10 Fab-HEL complex (11Padlan E.A. Silverton E.W. Sheriff S. Cohen G.H. Smith-Gill S.J. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5938-5942Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The VL chain can be related to the VH chain by a rotation angle of 170.8° around the pseudodyad axis between these two chains, which is almost the same as the Fab-fragment angle (170.7°). The location of the 125 water molecules that were identified in the complex is shown in Fig. 3. These molecules are located not only on the surface of the complex but also in the interface between the subunits making up the complex; six water molecules occupy the area where the VL chain interacts with HEL, whereas two are identified in the region between VH and HEL. Six water molecules participating in the interactions between HyHEL-10-VL and HEL were found in the interface of the complex, and some of them formed hydrogen bond networks (Fig.4). Almost all of the contacts of CDR-L2 and L3 with HEL are water-mediated interactions, suggesting that the imperfect complementarity between VL and HEL is improved by these solvent molecules. Only a few water molecules, or in some cases none, are found in the VH-VL interface of Fab-antigen complexes (9Braden B.C. Poljak R.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, 11 water molecules were also observed in the VH-VL interface, indicating that solvent molecules mediate the stabilization of variable domains. TableII shows the list of noncovalent interactions that occur between VH and HEL and between VL and HEL, taking into account the water-mediated hydrogen bonds among them. The list is based on the maximum number of van der Waals contacts and on the hydrogen bond distances for the atoms involved in the contacts as used by Sheriff et al. (41Sheriff S. Hendrickson W.A. Smith J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 197: 273-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). These include interactions between not only the main chain and side chain atoms, but also the main chain and main chain atoms.Table IINoncovalent interacting atoms between hen lysozyme and HyHEL-10 FvL-chainHELH-chainHELH-chainHELLAsn-31CγHis-15 CHThr-30OArg-73 CδHTyr-53Cε1Asp-101 CγCγHis-15 OHSer-31CαLeu-75 Cδ2Cε1Asp-101 Oδ1CγGly-16 CαCLeu-75 Cδ2CζTrp-63 Cζ2CγLys-96 NζOLeu-75 Cδ2HSer-54NAsp-101 Oδ1Oδ1Gly-16 CαHAsp-32NLeu-75 Cδ2CβAsp-101 CγOδ1Lys-96 NζCαLeu-75 Cδ2CβAsp-101 Oδ1Oδ1His-15 CCγLys-97 NζCβAsp-103 Nδ2Nδ2His-15 COδ1Lys-97 CεOγAsp-101 CγNδ2His-15 OOδ1Lys-97 NζOγAsp-101 Oδ1LAsn-32CγTyr-20 Oδ1HTyr-33CγLys-97 CεHSer-56CβGly-102 CαCγTyr-20 Cε1Cδ1Lys-97 CεOγGly-102 NCγLys-96 NζCε2Lys-97 OOγGly-102 CαOδ1Tyr-20 Cδ1Cε2Lys-97 CγHTyr-58Cδ1Arg-21 Nη2Oδ1Tyr-20 Cε1CζLys-97 OCε1Arg-21 Nη2Oδ1Lys-96 CεCζLys-97 CγCε2Ser-100 OOδ1Lys-96 CδOηTrp-63 Cγ3CζArg-21 Nη2Oδ1Lys-96 NζOηTrp-63 Cη2OηGly-102 CαNδ2Gly-16 OOηLys-97 CHTrp-95Cε3Lys-97 CδNδ2Tyr-20 Cδ1OηLys-97 OCε3Lys-97 CεLTyr-50Cδ1Lys-96 NζOηAsp-101 CβCζ2Ser-100 CβCδ2Asn-93 Oδ1HTyr-50Cε2Ser-100 OCζ2Ser-100 OγCε1Lys-96 CδCζSer-100 OCζ3Lys-97 CαCε1Lys-96 NζOηArg-21 CζCζ3Lys-97 CγCδ2Asn-93 CγOηArg-21 Nη1Cζ3Lys-97 CβCδ2Asn-93 Oδ1OηArg-21 Nη2Cζ3Lys-97 CδCζLys-96 CδOηSer-100 OCη2Lys-97 CαOηLys-96 CδOηSer-100 CβCη2Lys-97 CβLGin-53CδThr-89 Cγ2OηSer-100 CHAsp-96CγLys-97 NζCδAsn-93 Nδ2HSer-52CβAsp-101 CαOδ2Lys-97 CεOε2Asn-93 CγCβAsp-101 Oδ1Oδ2Lys-97 NζOε2Asn-93 Nδ2OγAsp-101 CαNε2Thr-89 Cγ2OγAsp-101 CβLSer-91OTyr-20 Cε1OγAsp-101 CγLAsn-92CArg-21 OδOγAsp-101 Oδ1OArg-21 NHTyr-53CβLeu-75 Cδ1OArg-21 CαCγLeu-75 Cδ1OArg-21 CδCδ1Trp-63 Cη2OArg-21 CγCδ1Asp-101 CβNδ2Asn-19 OCδ1Asp-101 CγLSer-93CαArg-21 CδCδ1Asp-101 Oδ1LTrp-94CβArg-21 CζCδ2Leu-75 Cδ1CβArg-21 NεCε1Trp-63 Cζ2LTyr-96Cε1Arg-21 Nη1Cε1Trp-63 Cη2CζArg-21 Nη1Cε1Asp-101 CβOηArg-21 Nη1Cε1Asp-101 Oδ2Hydrogen bond pairs and salt bridges are in boldface type.

Direct contacts with the antigen are made by the VH residues of Thr-30, Ser-31, Asp-32, Tyr-33, Tyr-50, Ser-52, Tyr-53, Ser-54, Ser-56, Tyr-58, Trp-95, and Asp-96 and by the VL residues of Asn-31, Asn-32, Tyr-50, Gln-53, Ser-91, Asn-92, Ser-93, Trp-94, and Tyr-96. Some of these (Tyr-50, Gln-53, Ser-91, Asn-92, Ser-93, and Tyr-96 in VL and Tyr-53 and Tyr-58 in VH) contact the antigen residues also through water molecules. In addition, the residues in CDR-H3 (Asp-101) make contact with the antigen only through water molecules retained in the interface. A total of 16 residues of HEL (His-15, Gly-16, Asn-19, Tyr-20, Arg-21, Trp-63, Arg-73, Leu-75, Thr-89, Asn-93, Lys-96, Lys-97, Ser-100, Asp-101, Gly-102, and Asn-103) make direct contact with the combining sites of the HyHEL10, and 11 residues (His-15, Asp-18, Asn-19, Tyr-20, Arg-21, Gly-22, Asn-77, Thr-89, Asn-93, Val-99, and Asp-101) make contact via water molecules retained in the interface. The antigenic regions covered by HyHEL-10 Fv upon complex formation are almost identical to the regions in Fab (11Padlan E.A. Silverton E.W. Sheriff S. Cohen G.H. Smith-Gill S.J. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5938-5942Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) (Table II). Both VH and VL of the Fv fragment were superimposed onto one of the Fab fragments by a least squares method, and the root mean square (r.m.s.) differences between the Cα atoms of the Fv structures and those of the Fab were calculated. The VH and VL chains of the Fv fragment gave an r.m.s. difference of 0.55 and 0.48 against the Fab fragment, respectively. These results indicate that the overall structure of the HyHEL-10 Fv-HEL complex is similar to that of the HyHEL-10 Fab-HEL complex (3HFM(11Padlan E.A. Silverton E.W. Sheriff S. Cohen G.H. Smith-Gill S.J. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5938-5942Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar)) (Table III). However, superimposition of the Cα coordinates of Fv HyHEL-10 VH onto those of Fab HyHEL-10 VH yielded an r.m.s. difference of 0.55 for VH, and aligning the Cα coordinates of the VL in Fv with those of the VL in Fab yielded an r.m.s. difference of 1.03 for VH. This r.m.s. difference may originate from the flexibility of the two domains in Fv due to a lack of constant domains (Table III).Table IIIr.m.s. difference in Cα atom of each chainVL or VHAllÅÅVL0.48 (0.83)0.62VH0.55 (1.03)0.63HEL0.47The r.m.s. differences in the middle column were given by superposing the Cα coordinates of the Fv VL chain with those of Fab VL chain (in parentheses for the Cα of VH), or by superposing the Cα coordinates of the Fv VH chain with Fab VH chain (in parentheses for the Cα of VL). In the right column, the Cα coordinates of all chains in Fv-HEL complex were used for superposing with those in Fab-HEL. Open table in a new tab The r.m.s. differences in the middle column were given by superposing the Cα coordinates of the Fv VL chain with those of Fab VL chain (in parentheses for the Cα of VH), or by superposing the Cα coordinates of the Fv VH chain with Fab VH chain (in parentheses for the Cα of VL). In the right column, the Cα coordinates of all chains in Fv-HEL complex were used for superposing with those in Fab-HEL. The interfacial area of the HyHEL-10 Fv-HEL complex was calculated to be 1800 Å2, which is larger than that of the HyHEL-10 Fab-HEL complex by about 200 Å2. The interfacial area differences between Fab and Fv are summarized in Fig.5. Almost all changes in the buried areas are within 11 Å2 in the VL chain. On the other hand, the buried areas of some residues increased (Ser-31, Tyr-53, Ser-54, and Trp-95 in the VH chain) or decreased (Asp-32 in the VH chain) by more than 10 Å2. Correspondingly, the increase in the buried areas of some residues in HEL (Asp-18, Arg-73, Asn-77, Gln-93, and Lys-97) is greater than 10 Å2, and the number of residues with a decreased buried area is only two (Tyr-20 and Asp-101). These results clearly indicate that the side chains of the Fv residues (VH chain, for the most part) make more contact with the antigen in comparison with the Fab residues. Although no large difference occurred in VL, two major conformational differences in the main chains in VH were observed. These residues are positioned at 31 and 99, both of which are located in the CDR (Fig.5). One conformational difference in the main chain in VH is located in CDR-H1, from Asp-27 to Ser-31 (Fig.6 A). In the case of Fab-HEL, Thr-30 and Ser-31 form hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions with Arg-73 of HEL. However, only the hydroxyl group of Ser-31 forms a weak hydrogen bond with a main chain atom of Arg-73 in the Fv-HEL complex (Table II). The average B factor of Arg-73 in the Fv-HEL complex suggests that the conformation of Arg-73 fluctuates in the complex. Asp-32 of VH forms a salt bridge with Lys-97 of HEL in both the Fab-HEL complex and the Fv-HEL complex despite relatively weak interactions due to solvent exposure. The distance between Oδ1 of Asp-32 and Nζ of Lys-97 in the Fv-HEL complex (2.6 Å) is closer than the distance in the Fab-HEL complex (3.6 Å), suggesting that a stronger salt bridge formed in the Fv-HEL complex than in the Fab-HEL complex. Another structural difference in the main chain is located in CDR-H3 from Asp-96 to Asp-101 (numbering of Kabat et al. (31Kabat E.A. Wu T.T. Perry H.M. Gottesman K.S. Foeller C. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest. Ed. 5. United States Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, NIH Publication No. 91-3242, 1991Google Scholar)) (Fig. 6 B). In the Fab-HEL complex, Asp-96 interacts by means of the van der Waals force with the residues of VL, which seem to contribute to the VH:VL contact. However, in the Fv-HEL complex, Asp-96 forms a salt bridge with Lys-97 of HEL (2.4 Å). The Cα atom of Asp-96 moves by about 2 Å toward the HEL, perhaps due to the salt bridge formation. In the Fab-HEL complex, one water molecule appears at the position at which the side chain of Asp-96 is located in the Fv-HEL complex (11Padlan E.A. S"
https://openalex.org/W2098584421,"ARF-like proteins (ARLs) comprise a functionally distinct group of incompletely characterized members in the ARF family of RAS-related GTPases. We took advantage of the GTP binding characteristics of human ARL2 to develop a specific, high affinity binding assay that allowed the purification of a novel ARL2-binding protein. A 19-kDa protein (BART, Binder of ArlTwo) was identified and purified from bovine brain homogenate. BART binding is specific to ARL2·GTP with high affinity but does not interact with ARL2·GDP or activated ARF or RHO proteins. Based on peptide sequences of purified bovine BART, the human cDNA sequence was determined. The 489-base pair BART open reading frame encodes a novel 163-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 18,822 Da. Recombinant BART was found to bind ARL2·GTP in a manner indistinguishable from native BART. Northern and Western analyses indicated BART is expressed in all tissues sampled. The lack of detectable membrane association of ARL2 or BART upon activation of ARL2 is suggestive of actions quite distinct from those of the ARFs. The lack of ARL2 GTPase-activating protein activity in BART led us to conclude that the specific interaction with ARL2·GTP is most consistent with BART being the first identified ARL2-specific effector.

The ARF proteins, numbering at least six distinct genes/proteins in mammals, are at least 60% identical at the amino acid level, and all share certain activities, specifically complementation of the lethal yeastarf1 − /arf2 −knockout mutant strain, co-factor activity in the bacterial toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gs, and activation of phospholipase D (15Brown H.A.

The ARF family also includes a group of more structurally divergent ARF-like proteins (ARLs) with 40–60% sequence identity to any ARF or to each other. The ARLs lack each of these ARF activities, although reports of relatively low activity have emerged for human ARL1 (18Hong J.X. Lee F.J. Patton W.A. Lin C.Y. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15872-15876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Only one ARL, so far, has been shown to be essential; deletion of ARF-like 1 in Drosophila melanogasteris lethal at an early embryonic stage (19Tamkun J.W. Kahn R.A. Kissinger M. Brizuela B.J.

There is a possibility that human ARL2 and ARL3 are not acylated, as they each fail to incorporate radiolabeled myristate when co-expressed with theN-myristoyltransferase (21Randazzo P.A. Weiss O. Kahn R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A lack of acylation would likely indicate a difference in cellular mechanisms asN-myristoylation of ARFs is essential in yeast and critical to a number of biochemical activities found for ARF proteins. ARFs offer a good example of diversity in GTPase signaling, as ARF proteins can regulate mitotic growth (5Zhang C. Cavenagh M.M. Kahn R.A. J. Biol.

Boman, J. Kuai, X. Zhu, J. Chen, R. Kuriyama, and R. A. Kahn, submitted for publication. Although there exists at least a partial understanding of a cellular role for ARF proteins, little is known about the function of any of the ARL proteins. To begin to define one or more signaling pathways for ARL proteins in mammals, we attempted to identify and characterize specific ARL-binding proteins. The ability of ARL2 to bind activating guanine nucleotide triphosphates to high stoichiometry, in the absence of detergents or lipids (22Clark J. Moore L. Krasinskas A. Way J. Battey J. Tamkun J. Kahn R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8952-8956Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), allowed the use of techniques not possible with ARF proteins. One such approach is the GTPase overlay, used successfully in previous studies to identify factors that interact with other small GTPases, such as RAC or CDC42 (23Manser E. Leung T. Monfries C. Teo M. Hall C. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16025-16028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar) and Ran (25Lounsbury K.M. Beddow A.L. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11285-11290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report we describe the identification, purification, and initial characterization of a novel 19-kDa bovine brain protein, BART, which specifically interacts with ARL2·GTP. This is the first protein shown to interact with an ARL protein. Based on the specificity and affinity of BART binding of ARL2·GTP, we conclude that BART is an effector for ARL2. Protein samples were prepared in Laemmli's sample buffer (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and boiled for 5 min before loading onto 12.5 or 15% polyacrylamide gels. Resolved proteins were either stained with colloidal brilliant blue (Sigma) or transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose filters (Bio-Rad), for 2 h at 60 V in Towbin's buffer (50 mm Tris base, 0.38m glycine, 0.1% SDS, 20% methanol (27Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar)). Immunoblots were performed as described previously (28Zhang C.J. Rosenwald A.G. Willingham M.C. Skuntz S. Clark J. Kahn R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Filters were developed for enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, ECL) to visualize reactive proteins. The GTPase overlay assay was developed by modifying the procedure of Lounsbury et al. (25Lounsbury K.M. Beddow A.L. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11285-11290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Up to 25 μg of protein was loaded per lane and resolved and transferred to nitrocellulose filters, as described above for immunoblots. Filters were then incubated for at least 1 h at 4 °C in renaturation buffer (10 mm MOPS, pH 7.1, 100 mm potassium acetate (KOAc), 5 mm magnesium acetate (MgOAc), 0.25% Tween 20, 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA)). The filter was then equilibrated by shaking in 15-ml binding buffer (20 mm MOPS pH 7.1, 100 mm KOAc, 5 mm MgOAc, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5% BSA, 5 mmDTT, 50 μm GTP, and 50 μm GDP) for at least 30 min at room temperature (RT). Radioactive ARL2·GTP was produced by incubating 2 μg of purified recombinant ARL2 with 20 μCi of [α-32P]GTP (3,000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) for 15 min at 30 °C in 15 μl of loading buffer, consisting of 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.1, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05 mmMgOAc, 1 mg/ml BSA, and 1 mm DTT. Approximately 70% of the radionucleotide is bound to protein at the end of this loading reaction. The filter was then incubated with the ARL2·[α-32P]GTP mixture in 15 ml of binding buffer for 15 min at RT with gentle shaking. Note that the binding buffer (also used for washes) contains 50 μm GTP and GDP to lower the specific activity of free nucleotides to such a point that binding of radionucleotides by filter-bound nucleotide-binding proteins is insignificant. The filter was then washed 3 times with binding buffer and then exposed to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co., XAR) or phosphorscreens (Molecular Dynamics Storm PhosphorImager) for analysis. All resins were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, except for Ultrogel AcA54 (Bio Sepra). All purification procedures were carried out at 4 °C unless otherwise indicated. Frozen bovine brains (≈300 g; Pel-Freez) were homogenized with a Polytron in 300 ml of ice-cold buffer, consisting of 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT (TNMD), and protease inhibitors (40 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin). The resulting homogenate was filtered through cheesecloth and spun at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (S100) was then applied to a 1 liter (bed volume) DEAE-Sephacel column (50 mm × 60 cm) and developed with a 0.1–1.0 m linear NaCl gradient in TNMD buffer at 240 ml/h. Fractions (15 ml) were assayed by gel overlay analysis, and fractions within the half-maximal activity range were pooled. ARL2·GTP binding activity eluted as a single peak, at a position corresponding to approximately 420 mm NaCl. The DEAE pool was slowly brought to 2 m ammonium sulfate at 4 °C with stirring for 30 min and then clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in a minimal volume of TNMD and applied to an AcA54 column (1-liter bed volume; 50 mm × 60 cm) at a flow rate of 60 ml/h. Fractions of 8 ml were collected and assayed for binding activity. The activity migrated as a single peak on both Aca54 and Superdex 75 gel filtration media. By using the latter matrix, the activity migrated with an apparent molecular mass of ≈25 kDa, by comparison to molecular weight standards. The pooled peak of activity was applied directly onto to a Source Q column (15-ml bed volume; 16 mm × 12 cm) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Proteins adsorbed to the column were eluted with a nonlinear 0.15–0.5m NaCl gradient, including a linear portion from 260 to 430 mm NaCl. Binding activity, eluting around 330 mm NaCl, was pooled and applied directly onto a Pro-RPC C1/C8 reversed phase column (2 ml; 5 mm × 10 cm) at a flow rate of 18 ml/h in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and developed in a gradient of 30–80% acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. This preparation was performed several times, with an estimated 4000-fold increase in specific activity and ∼3–4% total recovery of activity (see TableI).Table IRepresentative purification of BART from bovine brain extractsChromatographic stepBovine BART purificationPooled proteinPurificationRecovery-fold%S1006 g1 ×100DEAE-Sephacel1.6 g4 ×75Ultrogel AcA54337 mg50 ×30Source Q970 μg350 ×10Pro-RPC15 μg4000 ×4(∼6 μg BART)Each step in the chromatographic purification of BART is indicated, with total protein in the initial S100 material and in subsequent pooled peaks indicated.

The open reading frame of BART was amplified in a PCR reaction using synthetic oligonucleotides that incorporate unique restriction sites at each end to facilitate subcloning. Both native and hexa-histidine (6His)-tagged open reading frames were amplified, the latter achieved by additional sequence added to the 3′-oligonucleotide. The Taq polymerase was used, and the template was purified mini-prep DNA from EST 505092/z147e07.s1. Products from the PCR reaction were subcloned into the bacterial expression vector, pET3C (29Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar), and sequenced entirely to ensure against PCR-introduced mutations. BL21 cells (Invitrogen), containing recombinant plasmids, were grown to mid-log phase and induced for 1–3 h with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG). Cells were lysed using a French press and 6His-tagged BART was purified on a 1- or 5-ml HiTrap Chelating column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), according to manufacturer's instructions. Eluted BART-6His was further purified, and excess metal ions were removed by chromatography on a Superdex 75 gel filtration column (24 ml; 10 mm x 30 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Recombinant human ARL2 was expressed in BL21 cells and purified as described (14Clark J. Moore L. Krasinskas A. Way J. Battey J. Tamkun J. Kahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8952-8956Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). All protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). To assay binding between BART and activated ARL2 in solution, changes in the fluorescence of ARL2-bound N-methylanthraniloyl (Mant)-Gpp(NH)p were monitored. Recombinant ARL2 (0.15 μm) was loaded with 0.6 μm Mant-Gpp(NH)p in 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml BSA (HENDM) at RT, until fluorescence reached equilibrium (typically 5–10 min). Fluorescence was determined using a Perkin-Elmer LS-5B luminescence spectrometer using an excitation wavelength of 355 nm and measuring emission at 440 nm, as described previously (31Nisimoto Y. Freeman J.L.R. Motalebi S.A. Hirshberg M. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18834-18841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Changes in fluorescence, as a function of BART addition, were then determined. The theoretical best fit line described for the ΔF versus [BART] was obtained using a Michaelis-Menten, non-linear least squares fit of the data, as described in Nishimotoet al. (31Nisimoto Y.

The K D for a single binding site was determined using the following Equation 1, from Nomanbhoy and Cerione (32Nomanbhoy T.K. Cerione R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10004-10009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). ΔF=ΔFmax((KD+LT+RT)−((KD+LT+RT)2−4LT·RT)2/2RT)Equation 1 where ΔF is the fluorescence change after each addition of BART; ΔF max is the maximal change in fluorescence at an extrapolated, infinite [BART];K D is the dissociation constant;L T is the [BART], and R T is the total concentration of ARL2·Mant-Gpp(NH)p. Recombinant proteins or controls were incubated in single detergent buffer (SDB, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) with appropriate nucleotides for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) beads (10 μl) were then added and incubated an additional 1 h. Beads were then washed 3 times with SDB. Specifically bound proteins were eluted by boiling beads in Laemmli's sample buffer for 5 min. Samples were analyzed by immunoblotting, as described above, using rabbit polyclonal anti-BART (R46712-1) or mouse monoclonal anti-MYC epitope (33Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar) as primary antibodies. Polyclonal rabbit antisera were raised against purified, recombinant BART (with the carboxyl-terminal 6His tag; R46712-1) or human ARL2 (R86336-1). Subcutaneous inoculations were performed initially in complete Freund's adjuvant, followed by three boosts in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Preliminary characterization of the two antibody preparations has been primarily through immunoblotting. Less than 1 ng of purified BART-C′His and approximately 5 ng of ARL2 were detectable on immunoblots by the anti-BART and anti-ARL2 sera, respectively. The ARL2 antisera did not cross-react with other members of the ARF/ARL family. We tested 50 ng each of human ARF1, ARF4, ARF6, ARL1, and ARL3. Immunoreactivity could be effectively and specifically competed by preincubation with recombinant antigen (commonly 15 μg of recombinant protein with 4 μl of serum). GTP hydrolysis of ARL2, in the presence and absence of BART, was analyzed as described previously (34Randazzo P.A. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10758-10763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, ARL2 (2 μm final concentration) was loaded with [α-32P]GTP and then incubated in separate reactions +/− BART at 30 °C. Loading buffer consisted of 25 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 30 μCi of [α-32P]GTP, and 1 mm ATP. The GAP assay buffer included 1 mm GTP to lower the specific activity of free nucleotide and help prevent background levels to be raised by the presence of nucleotidases or other enzymes capable of hydrolyzing GTP in an ARL2-independent fashion. Reactions were stopped by dilution into ice-cold TNMD at various times and rapidly filtered on nitrocellulose filters (25 mm BA85, Schleicher & Schuell) to trap protein-bound nucleotides. Free nucleotides were then extracted from the filters by soaking in 1 m formic acid and resolved by chromatography on polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer plates developed in 1:1 (v/v) 1 m lithium chloride and 1m formate. Controls were included to ensure that only relevant GTP hydrolysis, catalyzed by ARL2, was included. Visualization and quantification of separated nucleotides was performed using a Molecular Dynamics Storm phosphorimaging system. Translocation of proteins from cytosolic to membrane associated forms was monitored by a modification of the method of Donaldson et al. (35Donaldson J.G. Cassel D. Kahn R.A. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6408-6412Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The source of cytosol was the mouse BC3H1 smooth muscle-like brain tumor-derived cell line, obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD). The source of membranes was Chinese hamster ovary cells, prepared as described previously (36Balch W.E. Dunphy W.G. Braell W.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 405-416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Membranes and cytosol were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min in the presence of either 25 μm GDP or GTPγS before membranes were collected by centrifugation. Pelleted material was then subjected to immunoblot analyses using the following primary antibodies: ARF (1D9; 40), ARL2 (R86336-1), or BART (R46712-1). Nylon filters containing poly(A)-enriched (2 μg/lane) RNA, isolated from assorted human tissues, were purchased from CLONTECH. The BART open reading frame was used as the probe and was labeled using random hexamer primers (Life Technologies, Inc.) and [α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products). Hybridization of probe to immobilized RNAs was performed at 68 °C in Express Hyb (CLONTECH) and washing increased to a final stringency of 0.1× SSC at 50 °C. Hybridizing bands were detected by exposure to film or phosphorscreens. The GTPase overlay assay was used to identify specific binding partners for activated ARL proteins. As described under “Materials and Methods,” this technique involves the electrophoretic separation of protein mixtures in SDS-polyacrylamide gels, followed by their transfer to nitrocellulose sheets where they are allowed to re-fold in a renaturation buffer and probed with a radioactively labeled ligand. This method depends upon the ability of the binding protein to (a) bind to the nitrocellulose, (b) be capable of re-folding properly following denaturing electrophoresis and transfer, (c) have a relatively high affinity for the ligand, and (d) be present in sufficient quantity to allow detection by the labeled ligand. Note that the ligand in this case is a protein, made radioactive by pre-loading with radionucleotides. Each of the human ARFs (ARF1–6) and two human ARLs (ARL2 and -3) were initially tested in the gel overlay assay, using bovine brain extract (an abundant source of ARF proteins) as tissue source for potential binding partners. By using the gel overlay protocol, we detected specific association between ARL2·GTP and a protein from bovine brain that migrated on SDS gels with a predicted molecular mass of about 19 kDa (Fig.1, lane 1). This binding activity was present in the soluble fraction (S100) but was absent from the pellet (P100; data not shown). Binding activity was increased approximately 20-fold or more by the inclusion of mixed micelles of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine and cholic acid (D/C, Fig. 1,lane 2) in the binding buffer of the gel overlay assay. Triton X-100 (0.1%) could be used in place of D/C to similar effect (data not shown). The presence of D/C in the assay increased either the re-folding of the binding protein or the interaction with ARL2 as it had only minimal effects on the binding of GTP to ARL2. We believe the former explanation is more likely true as Triton X-100 is not required in the solution binding assay (see below), but we have not explored this issue further. Interaction between the binding protein and ARL2 was dependent on GTP being bound to ARL2, as no signal was observed when equal specific activity [α-32P]GDP replaced the [α-32P]GTP in the loading reaction (Fig. 1, lane 5). An important control is shown in Fig. 1, lanes 3and 4. No binding activity was seen when the same amount of [α-32P]GTP, in the absence of ARL2, was used as the ligand in the overlay assay. This lack of binding activity was not changed by the addition of D/C (Fig. 1, lane 4). No GTP-binding proteins on the filter bound the labeled nucleotides in the overlay assay, due to the presence of high concentrations of unlabeled GDP and GTP in the binding buffer. The specific activity of the GTP in the ARL2-binding site is much higher than that of the nucleotide free in solution. Therefore, the GTPase overlay assay allowed the detection of a single protein species of approximately 19 kDa that bound ARL2 in a GTP-dependent fashion. The specificity of the binding protein for different GTPases was determined by replacement of ARL2 with other ARFs (human ARF1, 3–6), ARL3, or the small GTPase RhoA. Each of these proteins was loaded with [α-32P]GTP, but none gave a signal in the overlay assay (data not shown) when fractions containing the ARL2 binding activity were tested. An estimate of the affinity between ARL2 and the binding protein was obtained from competition experiments (see Fig.2). The specifically bound radioactivity in the gel overlay assay was effectively competed by the addition of increasing amounts of ARL2, loaded with unlabeled GTP. Half-maximal binding was observed with the addition of only 20 nmARL2·GTP. Whereas the binding activity was capable of re-folding after being boiled in Laemmli's sample buffer, electrophoresis through polyacrylamide and out of the gel onto nitrocellulose, incubation of the nitrocellulose filter with trypsin (0.25 mg/ml for 2 h at RT) totally abolished the binding signal (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that the S100 fraction from bovine brain contains a protein that binds ARL2 in a GTP-dependent fashion and with high specificity, with an apparentK D in the low nanomolar range. This protein was named BART, for binder of Arl2. Mouse tissues were used to check for the presence and relative abundance of BART activity in different organs. Tissues were harvested from a freshly sacrificed animal and homogenized in buffer, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Equal amounts of total tissue proteins (25 μg/lane) were loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels and assayed with the GTPase overlay assay. The activity was most abundant in brain, with a lesser amount apparent in muscle tissue (data not shown). Thus, our earlier choice of bovine brain as source of the binding protein proved to be fortuitous. However, even in brain, BART appeared to be present in only lo"

Insulin treatment stimulated glycogen synthase activity 4–5-fold in these cells. Cytosolic glycogen synthase levels decreased by 75% in response to insulin, whereas, conversely, the glycogenolytic agent isoproterenol increased cytosolic enzyme levels by 200%. Removal of extracellular glucose reduced glycogen synthase activation by 40% and completely blocked enzymatic translocation. Addition of 5 mm 2-deoxyglucose did not restore glycogen synthase translocation but did augment dephosphorylation of the protein by insulin.

Amylase pretreatment of the extracts suppressed glycogen synthase translocation, indicating that the enzyme was binding to glycogen. Incubation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with 10 mmglucosamine induced a state of insulin resistance, blocked the translocation of glycogen synthase, and inhibited insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis by 50%.

Under hyperglycemic conditions, insulin increases glucose uptake and stimulates the rate-limiting enzymes that regulate glucose oxidation and storage. In healthy subjects, 80–90% of glucose disposal occurs in skeletal muscle, where it is primarily stored as glycogen. Insulin acutely stimulates glycogen synthesis through activation of glycogen synthase (GS)1 and inactivation of glycogen phosphorylase. The coordinate increase in glucose uptake and regulation of glycogen metabolizing enzymes accounts for the marked stimulation of glycogen synthesis by insulin. GS, the rate-limiting enzyme in glycogen synthesis, is regulated allosterically and by covalent modification (1Lawrence Jr., J.C. Roach P.J. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 541-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Shulman R.G. Rothman D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7491-7495Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The protein is phosphorylated on six residues by a variety of kinases, which cumulatively inhibit its activity. Insulin-stimulated activation of glycogen targeted protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) results in the dephosphorylation of GS (3Saltiel A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: E375-E385PubMed Google Scholar). The hormone can also produce the inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), resulting in the disinhibition of GS by preventing its phosphorylation (4Cross D.A.E. Watt P.W.

Additionally, binding of glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) allosterically activates the enzyme and increases its susceptibility to dephosphorylation (7Kato K. Bishop J.S. J. Biol.

The increase in glucose transport and phosphorylation caused by insulin results in elevated levels of intracellular G6P, producing further activation of GS. Although the signaling pathways involved the metabolic actions of insulin are unclear, recent work has implicated an important role for phosphatidylinositol-3′ kinase (PI3′-K). Stimulation of PI3′-K by insulin results in the sequential activation of phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase and Akt kinase (reviewed in Ref. 10Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Cross D.A.E.

Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4397) Google Scholar), which may increase the amount of dephosphorylated, active GS in the cell (4Cross D.A.E. Watt P.W.

Furthermore, the importance of GSK-3 inactivation in regulating GS activity has not been conclusively demonstrated, and does not appear to contribute to the robust stimulation of GS by insulin in the 3T3-L1 adipocytes (5Ueki K.

Previous work has demonstrated that glucose metabolism plays an important role in the activation of GS by insulin. In primary adipocytes, insulin or elevated glucose alone had little effect on GS activity, but together, they produced a synergistic dephosphorylation and activation of the enzyme (8Lawrence Jr., J.C. James C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7975-7982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Lawrence Jr., J.C. Larner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2104-2113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Exposure of hepatocytes to glucose resulted in a dose-dependent increase in GS activity, consistent with changes in intracellular G6P levels (27Fernández-Novell J.M. Ariño J. Vilaró S. Bellido D. Guinovart J.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 28Villar-Palasi C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1244: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Additionally, hyperglycemia also resulted in the translocation of hepatic GS from the cytosol to a particulate fraction in normal and diabetic rats (29Fernández-Novell J.M. Ariño J. Vilaró S. Guinovart J.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 30Fernández-Novell J.M. Ariño J. Guinovart J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 665-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These results suggest that glucose uptake and metabolism correlate well with the activation of GS in the liver (reviewed in Ref. 31Villar-Palasi C. Guinovart J.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 544-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The specific activation of discrete pools of intracellular enzymes underlies the unique metabolic effects of insulin (32Mastick C.C. Brady M.J. Printen J.A. Ribon V. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 182: 65-71Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Signaling enzymes, such as PP1 and PI3′-K, are differentially activated by insulin as compared with other growth factors (24Brady M.J. Bourbonais F.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14063-14066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 33Navé B.T. Haigh R.J. Hayward A.C. Siddle K. Shepherd P.R.

Biochem. 1996; 239: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated changes in GS activation and localization in response to insulin in 3T3-L1 cells. We demonstrate here that increased glucose uptake and metabolism play an important role in the intracellular localization of GS and contributes to the regulation of the enzyme by insulin. Cell culture reagents were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc, with the exception of sera, which were supplied by Summit Biotechnology (Ft. Collins, CO). Insulin, glucose metabolites, and differentiation agents were from Sigma. UDP-[U-14C]glucose (286 mCi/mmol) was from ICN, and [U-14C]glucose (251 mCi/mmol) was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. ECL reagent was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, whereas GF/A filters were supplied by Whatman. Affinity purified chicken anti-PP1α, anti-pan-PP1, and anti-glycogen synthase antibodies were the generous gift of Dr. J. Lawrence (University of Virginia). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-chicken IgG was from Accurate Chemical Corp. (Westbury, NY). 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (high glucose) plus 10% calf serum. Following 2 days at confluence, differentiation was initiated by the addition of DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 167 nm insulin, 0.25 μmol/liter dexamethasone, and 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine. Three days later, the medium was replaced with DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum and 167 nm insulin. After 2 more days, the medium was switched to DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum. Adipocytes were used 5–14 days after completion of the differentiation protocol, when >95% of the cells expressed the adipocyte phenotype. Prior to experiments, cells were rinsed two times with low serum medium (DMEM containing 5 mm glucose, 0.5% fetal bovine serum, 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 0.29 mg/ml glutamine), and then incubated in the same medium for 2.5–3 h. When external glucose conditions were varied, cells were rinsed twice with low serum medium without glucose and once with low serum medium containing the indicated addition and then were preincubated in the same medium. Following treatment, cells were rapidly washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and were harvested in glycogen synthase buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.8), 100 mm NaF, 10 mm EDTA, 2 mg/ml glycogen, with 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl flouride, 1 mmbenzamidine. and 10 mg/liter aprotinen added just before use). 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate was also added when tyrosine phosphorylation was measured. Adipocytes were lysed by sonication (10 s, 20% output), and centrifuged at 2500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to pellet nuclei. The resulting postnuclear supernatant (PNS) fractions were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min to pellet plasma membranes and then at 100,000 × gfor 30–60 min to separate the cytosolic fraction from the glycogen-enriched pellet. Particulate fractions were resuspended in fresh glycogen synthase buffer using a 23-gauge needle. Glycogen synthase activity in the various cellular fractions was measured as described previously (35Lazar D.F. Wiese R.J. Brady M.J. Mastick C.C. Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Cuatrecasas P. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20801-20807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Briefly, 25–50 μl of lysate was assayed in a final volume of 100 μl of glycogen synthase buffer containing 5 mmUDP-glucose and 1 μCi/ml [U-14C]UDP-glucose, in the absence and presence of 10 mm G6P. Samples were incubated at 37 °C and then placed on ice for 15 min. 90 μl of the reaction was spotted on GF/A filters, dried for 3 s, and then placed in 70% ethanol on ice. Filters were washed for 20 min at 4 °C and then washed two more times in 70% ethanol at room temperature. Filters were air dried, and [U-14C]UDP-glucose incorporation into glycogen was measured by liquid scintillation counting. 3T3-L1 adipocytes grown in six-well dishes were serum-starved for 3 h in the presence of either 10 mm glucose or 10 mm glucosamine (pH 7.4). The cells were then switched to low serum medium containing either 10 mm glucose or 5 mm glucose and glucosamine. Following a 15-min stimulation with 100 nminsulin, 1 or 2 μCi of [14C]glucose was added to each well; a final specific activity of approximately 230 cpm/nmol glucose was attained for both conditions. After a 45-min incubation at 37 °C, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. [14C]Glucose incorporation into glycogen was then determined as described previously (35Lazar D.F. Wiese R.J. Brady M.J. Mastick C.C. Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Cuatrecasas P. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20801-20807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). 3T3-L1 adipocytes were serum-starved, harvested, and lysed by sonication. Nuclei and plasma membranes were pelleted by centrifugation, and the resulting supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes. Stocks of glucose metabolites were freshly prepared and diluted into the samples, which were nutated at 4 °C for 15 min, and then subjected to ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g for 30–60 min). The resulting cytosolic fractions were assayed for glycogen synthase activity; the identical samples were also analyzed by anti-glycogen synthase/anti-PP1α immunoblotting. For experiments involving UDP-glucose addition, the final UDP-glucose concentration in the assay was accounted for in the specific activity determination. In experiments involving amylase, extracts were preincubated for 15 min at 30 °C in the absence and presence of 40 μg/ml of amylase. Samples were then chilled on ice and processed as indicated above. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (35Lazar D.F. Wiese R.J. Brady M.J. Mastick C.C. Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Cuatrecasas P. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20801-20807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Protein determination was by the Bradford method. The effects of insulin and isoproterenol on GS activity in different intracellular fractions were measured. Cells were serum-starved for 3 h, followed by treatment with 100 nm insulin for 15 min. Adipocytes were lysed by sonication, and a PNS fraction was prepared by centrifugation at 2000 × g. The PNS lysate was further fractionated by differential centrifugation, to prepare the plasma membrane, cytosolic, and glycogen-enriched fractions. Samples were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-GS and anti-PP1 antibodies. Neither treatment had any effect on the total amount of GS or PP1 within the cell (Fig. 1, lanes 1–3). However, insulin treatment caused a 75% reduction in cytosolic GS levels (lanes 4 and 5), and a reciprocal increase in the amount of GS found in the plasma membrane fraction (lanes 7 and 8). Conversely, the glycogenolytic agent isoproterenol doubled the amount of cytosolic GS and reduced plasma membrane enzymatic levels (Fig. 1, lanes 4 and 6 and lanes 7 and 9). Identical results were obtained in GS activity assays (data not shown). Neither agent had any effect on the localization of PP1 (Fig.1 A), GSK-3β, and the catalytic subunit of phosphorylase kinase (data not shown). However, the hormone-induced changes in cytosolic GS were greater than the corresponding shifts in plasma membrane levels, indicating that another cellular compartment was involved. Subsequent data indicated that GS also translocated to the glycogen-enriched fraction in response to insulin. These results suggest that the intracellular localization of GS is subject to reciprocal regulation by opposing hormonal agents that control glycogen metabolism. The time course of the effect of insulin on cytosolic GS was measured. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated for various times with 100 nm insulin, cytosolic fractions were prepared and GS levels were measured by activity assay and immunoblotting. Insulin induced a rapid decrease in cytosolic GS activity, which was maximal by 15–30 min (Fig. 2 A). Anti-GS immunoblots revealed corresponding changes in GS protein levels, whereas cytosolic PP1 levels were unchanged by insulin (Fig.2 B). The time course of GS activation by insulin in the glycogen fraction slightly preceded the ability of insulin to reduce cytosolic GS levels (Fig. 2 C). The translocation of GS by insulin described in Fig. 2 A was stable. Following a 15 min stimulation with insulin, cells were extensively washed and then placed in medium to recover. Under these conditions, the tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate-1 returned to the basal state within 1.5 h (data not shown). However, cytosolic GS levels did not recover until 6–24 h later (Fig. 2 D). Interestingly, isoproterenol increased cytosolic GS levels in cells that had been pretreated with insulin for 30 min, indicating that GS localization was responsive to sequential, opposing stimuli (data not shown). Fernández-Novell et al. (27Fernández-Novell J.M. Ariño J. Vilaró S. Bellido D. Guinovart J.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 29Fernández-Novell J.M. Ariño J. Vilaró S. Guinovart J.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) have previously implicated a role for glucose uptake and phosphorylation in the regulation of hepatic GS localization. To determine whether the effects of insulin described above could be attributed to increased glucose metabolism, the effects of extracellular glucose on the insulin-stimulated activation and translocation of GS in 3T3-L1 adipocytes were investigated. Following serum starvation, cells were stimulated with 100 nm insulin for 15 min, and GS activity and localization were examined. In the presence of 5 mmextracellular glucose, insulin caused a 4-fold increase in the G6P-independent GS activity in the PNS fraction (Fig.3 A). Removal of extracellular glucose caused a 40% reduction in GS activation by insulin. Inclusion of 5 mm 2-deoxyglucose in the media led to a dramatic increase in both basal and insulin-stimulated GS activity, probably due to the intracellular accumulation of 2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate (26Lawrence Jr., J.C. Larner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2104-2113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In parallel, cells were further fractionated, and cytosolic GS levels were measured. In the presence of 5 mm extracellular glucose, insulin caused a 75% reduction in cytosolic GS total activity (Fig. 3 B), with a commensurate change in GS protein levels (Fig. 3 B, inset). In the absence of glucose, the translocation of GS was completely blocked (Fig. 3 B). In the presence of 5 mm 2-deoxyglucose, insulin produced a dramatic increase in the gel mobility of GS (Fig. 3 B, inset), indicative of a decrease in the net phosphorylation state of the enzyme (8Lawrence Jr., J.C. James C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7975-7982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, under these conditions, the translocation of cytosolic GS induced by insulin was not restored (Fig.3 B). These results are in contrast to previous work in hepatocytes, in which insulin reportedly caused a similar translocation of GS in the presence of either glucose or 2-deoxyglucose (27Fernández-Novell J.M. Ariño J. Vilaró S. Bellido D. Guinovart J.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 29Fernández-Novell J.M. Ariño J. Vilaró S. Guinovart J.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Variations in endogenous glucose production or different GS isoforms in the two cell types may explain this discrepancy. These data indicate that the insulin-stimulated translocation of cytosolic GS requires increased glucose uptake and further metabolism after phosphorylation by hexokinase. To identify the glucose metabolite responsible for this activity, an in vitro assay for the translocation of GS was developed. Lysates were prepared from basal 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and a combined cytosolic/glycogen fraction was prepared. 5 mm G6P, G1P, or UDP-glucose was added, mixed at 4 °C for 15 min, and then subjected to ultracentrifugation to pellet the glycogen particles. GS was assayed in the resulting cytosolic supernatant. Addition of both G6P and G1P had no effect on GS total activity (Fig. 4 A) or protein levels (Fig. 4 B), further confirming that G6P does not mediate the effect of insulin on GS localization in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. However, addition of UDP-glucose reduced cytosolic GS total activity by over 50% (Fig. 4 A). Anti-GS immunoblots revealed a similar decrease in GS levels (Fig. 4 B). Pretreatment of the lysate with amylase prior to UDP-glucose addition completely blocked the loss of cytosolic GS (Fig. 4 B, lanes 5 and 6), indicating that the enzyme was translocating directly to glycogen. The effect was specific for UDP-glucose, as the addition of UDP-galactose and UDP-mannose had no effect (Fig. 4 C). UDP-glucose induced the translocation of cytosolic GS from basal extracts with an EC50 of approximately 0.7 mm (Fig.5). Pretreatment of the cells with insulin and 5 mm 2-deoxyglucose, to maximize GS dephosphorylation, resulted in a 5-fold leftward shift of the UDP-glucose concentration curve (Fig. 5), indicating that activated GS may be more sensitive to changes in intracellular UDP-glucose levels.Figure 5UDP-glucose concentration curve.Replicate plates of 3T3-L1 adipocytes were serum-starved and treated in the absence and presence of 100 nm insulin and 5 mm 2-DG for 15 min. Samples were processed as in Fig. 4, and the indicated amounts of UDP-glucose were added. Following preparation of cytosolic fractions, total GS activity was measured. The varying final concentrations of UDP-glucose in the GS assay were accounted for in the specific activity determination. Results are representative of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Glucosamine has been proposed to mediate insulin resistance resulting from chronic hyperglycemia (36Marshall S.

Diabetes. 1995; 44: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Because this sugar may undergo a metabolic fate similar to glucose, its effects on GS activation by insulin were examined. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were serum-starved for 3 h in the presence of either 10 mm glucose or glucosamine prior to insulin stimulation. Under this protocol, insulin signaling was reduced by approximately 50% as measured by either the tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor or insulin receptor substrate-1 (Fig.6 A), or the phosphorylation of Akt or mitogen-activated protein kinase (Fig. 6 B andC). These results are consistent with another report in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (39Hresko R.C. Heimberg H. Chi M.M.-Y. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20658-20668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), despite differences in the glucosamine preincubation protocols. Substitution of glucose with glucosamine in the medium completely blocked the insulin-stimulated translocation of GS from the cytosolic fraction, similar to incubation of the cells in the absence of glucose (Fig. 7 A). However, the dephosphorylation of GS by insulin was still readily apparent in the presence of glucosamine as determined by gel mobility shift (Fig.7 A). Surprisingly, glucosamine preincubation resulted in an apparent 4-fold increase in insulin-stimulated GS activity in the PNS fraction (Fig. 7 B). However, when glycogen-enriched pellets from the same lysates were prepared by ultracentrifugation and resuspended in fresh buffer prior to assay, the effect of glucosamine on insulin stimulated-GS activity was markedly reduced (Fig.7 B). These data suggested that glucosamine treatment resulted in the intracellular accumulation of an allosteric activator of GS, which was carried over into the in vitro GS assays. Because glucosamine is structurally related to 2-deoxyglucose, the accumulation of glucosamine 6-phosphate following insulin treatment may result in direct activation of GS. Therefore, the effects of glucosamine 6-phosphate on GS activity were compared with those of G6P. PNS fractions were prepared from basal 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and GS activity was measured in vitro in the presence of the increasing concentrations of either G6P or glucosamine 6-phosphate. The two metabolites activated GS with identical concentration curves, although absolute GS activity was about 20% lower at all glucosamine 6-phosphate concentrations (Fig. 7 C). Addition of either 10 mm glucose 1-phosphate or 10 mm glucosamine 1-phosphate to the assay had no effect on GS activity (data not shown). The effects of glucosamine on insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes were next examined. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were serum-starved for 3 h in the presence of either 10 mmglucose or glucosamine. Immediately prior to insulin stimulation, the medium was switched to one containing either 10 mm glucose or 5 mm glucose plus 5 mm glucosamine. [14C]Glucose incorporation into glycogen was then measured. Insulin caused a 100-fold stimulation of glycogen synthesis in the cells pretreated with glucose (Fig. 7 D). However, despite the dramatic enhancement of insulin-stimulated GS activity in the presence of glucosamine, glycogen synthesis was reduced by 60% in the glucosamine-pretreated cells (Fig. 7 D). This deficit most likely results from diminished insulin receptor signaling and ATP levels (Fig. 6 A) (37Robinson K.A. Sens D.A. Buse M.G. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 1333-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), as well as direct inhibition of glucose uptake and phosphorylation by glucosamine. The reported reduction in UDP-glucose levels during glucosamine treatment (40Hawkins M. Angelov I. Liu R. Barzali N. Rossetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4889-4895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 41Yki-Järvinen H. Virkamäki A. Daniels M.C. McClain D. Gottschalk W.K. Metabolism. 1998; 47: 449-455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) may arise from inhibition of glucose uptake coupled with the allosteric activation of GS by glucosamine 6-phosphate. The molecular basis for the specificity in signal transduction for insulin remains uncertain. One factor that is likely to play an important role is spatial compartmentalization. Indeed, the specific activation of discrete pools of proteins may explain the unique spectrum of effects of insulin. Moreover, many of the cellular actions of insulin result from changes in cellular localization of signaling molecules. We report here that the activation of GS by insulin involves changes in its cellular compartmentalization, in addition to previously described covalent modifications. Insulin primarily stimulated GS dephosphorylation in the glycogen-containing fraction. Additionally, the hormone caused the dramatic reduction in the cytosolic levels of GS protein, as measured both by enzyme activity and immunoblotting. Agents that promoted glycogen breakdown, such as isoproterenol (Fig. 1) and norepinephrine (data not shown), result in a 2–3-fold increase in cytosolic GS levels. The effects of insulin and isoproterenol on cytosolic GS were mirrored by reciprocal changes in the crude plasma membrane fraction, which also contains glycogen. However, the amount of cytosolic GS translocating in response to hormonal treatment was greater than the corresponding change in plasma membrane enzyme levels, indicating that another cellular compartment was also involved.In vitro experiments (Fig. 4 B) suggest that GS translocates to glycogen in response to insulin, secondary to an elevation in intracellular UDP-glucose levels. The high basal enzyme levels most likely masked any changes in GS in the glycogen-enriched pellet. In contrast, there was no detectable change in the localization of other enzymes that regulate glycogen metabolism, namely PP1, GSK-3β, and the catalytic subunit of phosphorylase kinase. Together, these data suggest a specific, reversible translocation of GS between the cytosolic and glycogen-containing fractions, paralleling changes in glycogen accumulation and breakdown. Previous work in skeletal muscle had suggested that changes in the cellular localization of PP1 (42Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 43Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 172-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar) are primarily responsible for the regulation of glycogen synthesis. Differential phosphorylation of the PP1 glycogen targeting subunit, GM, by insulin and agents that elevated intracellular levels of cAMP was reported to underlie the regulation of phosphatase activity present at the glycogen particle (44Dent P. Lavoinne A. Nakielny S Caudwell F.B. Watt P. Cohen P. Nature. 1990; 348: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Thus, during conditions of increased glycogen synthesis, more PP1 activity was stimulated, whereas under glycogenolytic conditions, PP1 translocated away from glycogen into the cytosol. However, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we were unable to detect any translocation of PP1 following stimulation with either insulin or adenylate cyclase activators (Fig.1), in agreement with previous results from primary adipocytes (45Brady M.J. Printen J.A. Mastick C.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20198-20204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The principal PP1 glycogen targeting subunit in adipocytes, PTG, does not contain the two putative regulatory phosphorylation sites found in GM (46Printen J.A. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1475-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), nor is PTG phosphorylated in response to insulin or forskolin (45Brady M.J. Printen J.A. Mastick C.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20198-20204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, translocation of PP1 does not appear to be required for the hormonal regulation of GS activity in adipocytes. Hepatic GS has been reported to translocate from the cytosol to a particulate fraction in response to elevations of extracellular glucose (27Fernández-Novell J.M. Ariño J. Vilaró S. Bellido D. Guinovart J.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 29Fernández-Novell J.M. Ariño J. Vilaró S. Guinovart J.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, the translocation pattern was unaffected by amylase treatment of the lysates (29Fernández-Novell J.M. Ariño J. Vilaró S. Guinovart J.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), indicating that hepatic GS was bound to a site other than glycogen. Interestingly, GS translocated to an actin-rich area near the plasma membrane, where most of the de novo glycogen synthesis occurred (47Fernández-Novell J.M. Bellido D. Vilaró S. Guinovart J.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The degree of GS translocation in hepatocytes correlated tightly with changes in intracellular G6P levels (27Fernández-Novell J.M. Ariño J. Vilaró S. Bellido D. Guinovart J.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 29Fernández-Novell J.M. Ariño J. Vilaró S. Guinovart J.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), but presumably, UDP-glucose levels also increased in parallel. However, GS translocation was unaffected by substitution of extracellular glucose with 2-deoxyglucose, indicating that UDP-glucose does not mediate hepatic GS translocation (27Fernández-Novell J.M. Ariño J. Vilaró S. Bellido D. Guinovart J.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 29Fernández-Novell J.M. Ariño J. Vilaró S. Guinovart J.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These data suggested that G6P regulates GS activity by several mechanisms: inducing translocation of the enzyme, enhancing its dephosphorylation by PP1, and allosterically activating the enzyme. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, it appears that GS translocation is regulated in a different fashion. Removal of extracellular glucose completely blocked the translocation of cytosolic GS (Fig. 3 A) and diminished the insulin-stimulated enzymatic activation, although not to the extent observed in primary adipocytes (8Lawrence Jr., J.C. James C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7975-7982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Substitution of extracellular glucose with 2-deoxyglucose dramatically enhanced the insulin-induced dephosphorylation of GS (Fig. 3 B). However, the translocation of cytosolic GS in response to insulin was completely blocked by 2-deoxyglucose (Fig. 3 B) and 3-O-methyl glucose (data not shown), indicating that a glucose metabolite formed downstream of G6P was involved. Cytosolic GS translocation was specifically replicated in vitro by the addition of UDP-glucose to basal 3T3-L1 adipocyte lysates, whereas G6P and several other sugar metabolites were without effect. In contrast to results in hepatocytes (29Fernández-Novell J.M. Ariño J. Vilaró S. Guinovart J.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), pretreatment of the lysates with amylase completely blocked the effect of UDP-glucose on cytosolic GS levels, indicating that GS translocated directly to glycogen. Thus, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, elevation of UDP-glucose increases the affinity of GS for its other substrate, glycogen. The reason for the discrepancy between the results in hepatocytes and 3T3-L1 adipocytes is unclear, but it may represent tissue-specific differences in the regulation of GS. In the absence of extracellular glucose, insulin stimulation of GS activity was diminished, but it occurred without any change in cytosolic GS levels. This result suggests that enzymatic activation and translocation are unrelated. However, the regulation of GS localization on the glycogen particle has not been extensively examined. Presumably, to mediate glycogen synthesis, GS must be both activated and bound to a portion of the glycogen polymer that can be elongated. It is tempting to speculate that UDP-glucose may specifically induce GS to bind to the ends of the glycogen chains, where the enzyme could efficiently catalyze the incorporation of UDP-glucose into glycogen. If so, GS translocation may represent a disproportionate component of enzyme mediating the stimulation of glycogen synthesis by insulin. Conversely, the removal of activated GS from glycogen to the cytosol by isoproterenol is an additional mechanism for the enhancement of glycogenolysis. The stimulation of glucose transport and metabolism by insulin thus appears to regulate GS activity by a several mechanisms. Increased intracellular levels of G6P can allosterically activate GS, as well as enhance the dephosphorylation and activation of GS by PP1. Furthermore, elevation of UDP-glucose levels appears to induce the translocation of GS to glycogen, where it is in proximity to both its substrate, glycogen, and its insulin-responsive activator, glycogen-targeted PP1. Thus, a system for the coordinate translocation of glucose transporter and GS may potentiate the insulin-meditated increase in glycogen storage. In contrast, insulin and isoproterenol had no effect on the subcellular distribution of PP1. Therefore, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, the translocation of GS, rather than PP1, appears to partially underlie the hormonal regulation of glycogen metabolism. Experiments are currently under way to assess the relative importance of subcellular localization of these two enzymes in skeletal muscle, in response to hormonal stimulation and exercise. The allosteric activation of GS by glucosamine 6-phosphate has recently been reported (48Virkamäki A. Yki-Järvinen H. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1101-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar)."

One antioxidant enzyme Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase 1 (Sod1p) plays an important role in detoxifying superoxide radicals (O⨪2). Superoxide radicals can oxidize iron-sulfur cluster proteins liberating iron (1Flint D.H. Tuminello J.F. Emptage M.H. J. Biol.

To further our understanding of oxidative damage to the cell, we examined the effects of superoxide dismutase deficiency on overall cell structure and organelle morphology and asked whether any such abnormalities may be tied into iron-mediated toxicity. We report here that oxidative stress to sod1Δ yeast results in fragmentation of the vacuole, an organelle analogous to the lysosome and thought to play a role in iron homeostasis (Refs. 18Raguzzi F. Lesuisse E. Crichton R.R. FEBS Lett. 1988; 231: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar and 19Bode H.P. Dumschat M. Garotti S. Fuhrmann G.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we find lowering iron availability significantly reduces damage to the vacuole, consistent with disruption of iron handling as part of the pathway through which Sod1p deficiency causes vacuole fragmentation.DISCUSSIONBecause mitochondria are the primary intracellular sources of superoxide radicals, we anticipated mitochondrial damage insod1Δ yeast. However, the most obvious sod1Δdefects were not in the mitochondria, but rather in the vacuole. Oxidative stress to Sod1p-deficient yeast leads to vacuolar fragmentation through an iron-dependent process. Evidence that the vacuole fragmentation is oxygen (presumably superoxide radical) mediated includes the findings that only aerobically grownsod1Δ yeast exhibit aberrant vacuoles and genetic supressors (such as pmr1Δ) capable of rescuing all other known aerobic sod1Δ deficits can also rescue this fragmentation phenotype. Iron deprivation (as in fet3Δ sod1Δ strains) also alleviates the fragmentation without providing resistance to O⨪2 generating reagents or ameliorating other oxygen-dependent phenotypes of sod1Δyeast. Thus, reactive oxygen species arising in the absence of Sod1p, in combination with iron, provoke damage to vacuoles.The notion of iron exacerbating damage under conditions of oxidative stress has been raised previously in other contexts. Fe2+can react with physiological levels of H2O2(and possibly other reactive oxygen species) to produce toxic hydroxyl radicals (reviewed in Ref. 48Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (4414) Google Scholar). In vivo, iron is not found typically in a free state but is sequestered as iron complexes or is bound protectively to enzymes, proteins, or iron carriers (for review, see Refs. 48Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (4414) Google Scholar and 52Kaplan J. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1996; 271: 1510-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, superoxide can alter this cellular iron homeostasis. Several groups have found in vivo evidence that superoxide radicals oxidize labile iron-sulfur clusters to liberate iron (1Flint D.H. Tuminello J.F. Emptage M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22369-22376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Flint D. Smyk-Randall E. Tuminello J.F. Draczynska-Lusiak B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 1478-1483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) although the fate and redox state of the “liberated” iron is not known. Additionally, genetic screens have found that mutations in iron-sulfur cluster assembly proteins lessen oxidative damage in sod1Δ yeast, suggesting that reducing the number of iron-sulfur targets for oxygen radical damage lessens damage in these oxidatively stressed cells (53Strain J. Lorenz C.R. Bode J. Garland S. Smolen G.A. Ta D.T. Vickery L.E. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31138-31144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Similarly, superoxide radicals have been shown to oxidize iron storage components to liberate iron which is released in a form capable of catalyzing hydroxyl radical production (54Biemond P. Eijk H.G.v. Swaak A.J. Koster J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 73: 1576-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). More generally, Wisnicka et al. (40Wisnicka R. Krzepilko A. Wawryn J. Krawiec Z. Bilinski T. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1998; 44: 635-641PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested that superoxide radicals (in sod1Δ yeast) may influence the redox status of cellular iron pools by reducing Fe3+ to the more reactive Fe2+ state. Although total iron is not elevated in sod1Δyeast, 2V. C. Culotta, unpublished results. the cellular distribution of iron, the ratio of ferrous to ferric iron, and the level of free iron may be altered. In any case, much evidence does suggest that oxygen radicals liberate iron which in turn may exacerbate oxidative damage.In yeast, the vacuole plays a role in iron homeostasis. Subcellular fractionation of iron-loaded cells suggests that the vacuole is the major site of iron sequestration (18Raguzzi F. Lesuisse E. Crichton R.R. FEBS Lett. 1988; 231: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and yeast lacking a recognizable vacuole structure are unable to accumulate high levels of iron (19Bode H.P. Dumschat M. Garotti S. Fuhrmann G.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, an iron-enriched yeast vacuole may be particularly susceptible to iron-mediated damage in superoxide-rich sod1Δ yeast. One possibility is that the vacuole damage may result from a disruption of the iron storage state in the vacuole. Under the influence of increased superoxide levels (which perhaps may be found throughout the Sod1p-deficient cell), vacuolar iron pools may be converted to a more accessible and active Fe2+ state that can catalyze hydroxyl radical production and damage macromolecules in the immediate vicinity of the vacuole. A second, not mutually exclusive, possibility is that alterations in iron handling and homeostasis within the cell may result in an increased trafficking of free iron to the vacuole. Increased vacuolar iron may result in increased iron-mediated oxidative reactions within the vacuole or alternatively, the increased iron may simply bind nonproductively to various sites in the vacuole (i.e.sulfur, nitrogen, or oxygen containing ligands). We cannot rule out the possibility that the primary damage actually occurs to cytosolic components that then secondarily afflict vacuolar structure and function. Indeed, we should stress, however, that there is not a global defect in trafficking to the vacuole or vacuole assembly as judged by normal carboxypeptidase Y trafficking results. In any case, both reactive oxygen species and iron contribute to vacuole changes.Iron-mediated damage occurs not just in the yeast vacuole but also in the mammalian analogue, the lysosome. Similar to the yeast vacuole, the lysosome plays a role in intracellular iron storage, homeostasis, and detoxification (55Radisky D.C. Kaplan J. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 56LeSage G.D. Kost L.J. Barham S.S. LaRusso N.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 90-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Iron overload in the rat liver has been shown to increase lysosomal fragility (56LeSage G.D. Kost L.J. Barham S.S. LaRusso N.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 90-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Although lysosomal fragility has been partially attributed to lipid peroxidation, we should stress that similar lipid membrane damage is not the cause of sod1Δvacuole abnormalities because S. cerevisiae do not synthesize the polyunsaturated fatty acids that are susceptible to lipid peroxidation (57Bilinski T. Litwinska J. Blaszczynski M. Bajus A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1001: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Damage to vacuolar membrane proteins (as well as lysosomal membrane proteins) is a more likely possibility.By examining structural changes in cellular architecture caused by Sod1p deficiency, we have uncovered a plausible explanation for various puzzling defects in the sod1Δ yeast: some of the pleiotropic sod1Δ phenotypes may arise as secondary consequences of a compromised vacuole. For example, sod1Δyeast have a sporulation defect (16Liu X.F. Elashvili I. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Lapinskas P. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18298-18302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and an increased death rate upon entering stationary phase (17Longo V.D. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12275-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Previously, this sensitivity to adverse conditions was attributed to mitochondrial insufficiency (16Liu X.F. Elashvili I. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Lapinskas P. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18298-18302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Longo V.D. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12275-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). However, although sod1Δ yeast do not grow as robustly on non-fermentable carbon sources as wild-type yeast, they nevertheless are respiration proficient (e.g. Ref. 15Gralla E.B. Kosman D.J. Adv. Genet. 1992; 30: 251-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Instead, we suggest these sod1Δ abnormalities may be, in part, vacuole related. When yeast are exposed to such adverse conditions, they normally up-regulate vacuolar hydrolases to turnover intravacuolar reserves and cytosolic macromolecules in order to recycle necessary nutrients (36Achstetter T. Wolf D.H. Yeast. 1985; 1: 139-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 37Jones E.W. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1984; 18: 233-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 38Teichert U. Mechler B. Muller H. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16037-16045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that the sod1Δ yeast cannot survive through such starvation conditions may be an indication that either vacuolar nutrient storage or the vacuolar-dependent macromolecular turnover processes are compromised. Indeed, many known vacuolar mutants also cannot survive adverse conditions (39Preston R.A. Manolson M.F. Becherer K. Weidenhammer E. Kirkpatrick D. Wright R. Jones E.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5801-5812Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we demonstrate that sod1Δ yeast have a sensitivity to pH which cannot easily be explained without invoking the role of the vacuole in pH homeostasis. Likewise, an increased sensitivity to transition metals may be directly or indirectly related to vacuole abnormalities. Thus, some of the curious metabolic and biochemical abnormalities in sod1Δ yeast may in fact be attributable to vacuolar aberrations.In summary, we demonstrate that oxidative stress to sod1Δyeast results in vacuolar fragmentation and either removal of oxygen or iron can ameliorate the damage. This may have medical relevance in that oxidative damage and alterations in iron homeostasis have been implicated in a number of disease states including atherosclerosis, neurodegeneration, arthritis, and aging (for review, see Ref. 48Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (4414) Google Scholar). In some cases oxidative insult is thought to be the primary cause of damage. For example, brain and spinal cord deterioration after ischemic or traumatic injury often appears excessive for the level of trauma (58Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Trends Neurosci. 1985; 8: 22Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (787) Google Scholar). One explanation put forth is that iron-binding capacity in the central nervous system and in the cerebral spinal fluid bathing the central nervous system is particularly low. Thus, release of iron by oxidatively or mechanically damaged cells, organelles, and proteins may catalyze toxic oxidative side reactions causing further cell injury. Consistent with this concept, preliminary trials of treatment with iron-chelating agents have had success in diminishing post-traumatic degeneration of brain and spinal cord (59Hall E.D. J. Neurosurg. 1988; 68: 462-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 60Hall E.D. Yonkers P.A. McCall J.M. Braughler J.M. J. Neurosurg. 1988; 68: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Thus, iron-mediated oxidative damage is likely a common event in aerobic organisms, and dissection and understanding of the process (and ways of prevention) in yeast may give insight into human disease. Aerobic organisms are chronically exposed to potentially harmful reactive oxygen species generated as by-products of cellular metabolism. One antioxidant enzyme Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase 1 (Sod1p) plays an important role in detoxifying superoxide radicals (O⨪2). Superoxide radicals can oxidize iron-sulfur cluster proteins liberating iron (1Flint D.H. Tuminello J.F. Emptage M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22369-22376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Flint D. Smyk-Randall E. Tuminello J.F. Draczynska-Lusiak B. J. Biol.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13635-13640Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Thus, Sod1p-deficient yeast (sod1Δ yeast) may have increased pools of reactive iron (5Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 1994; 16: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) as has been shown for SOD1-deficientEscherichia coli (4Keyer K. Imlay J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13635-13640Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). “Free” iron can react with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and possibly other reactive oxygen species, to generate toxic hydroxyl radicals (OH−) by Fenton chemistry (6Fenton H.J.H. J. Chem. Soc. 1894; 65: 899-903Crossref Google Scholar, 7Haber F. Weiss J. Proc. R. Soc. London. 1934; 147: 332-351Crossref Google Scholar). Hydroxyl radicals have the potential to damage proteins, nucleic acids, and membranes (4Keyer K. Imlay J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13635-13640Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 8Bostek C. J. Am. Assoc. Nur. Anes. 1989; 57: 231-237Google Scholar, 9Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C.

In recent years, insight into oxidative defense, and SOD1 in particular, has come from studies using the unicellular eukaryote,Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Yeast lacking Sod1p grow slowly in air (13Bilinski T. Krawiec Z. Liczmanski L. Litwinska J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), are sensitive to superoxide generating agents (e.g. paraquat) (13Bilinski T. Krawiec Z. Liczmanski L. Litwinska J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 14Gralla E. Valentine J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5918-5920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and exhibit as yet poorly understood metabolic and biosynthetic defects (13Bilinski T. Krawiec Z. Liczmanski L. Litwinska J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 14Gralla E. Valentine J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5918-5920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Gralla E.B.

Chem. 1996; 271: 12275-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). To further our understanding of oxidative damage to the cell, we examined the effects of superoxide dismutase deficiency on overall cell structure and organelle morphology and asked whether any such abnormalities may be tied into iron-mediated toxicity. We report here that oxidative stress to sod1Δ yeast results in fragmentation of the vacuole, an organelle analogous to the lysosome and thought to play a role in iron homeostasis (Refs. 18Raguzzi F. Lesuisse E. Crichton R.R. FEBS Lett. 1988; 231: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar and 19Bode H.P. Dumschat M. Garotti S. Fuhrmann G.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we find lowering iron availability significantly reduces damage to the vacuole, consistent with disruption of iron handling as part of the pathway through which Sod1p deficiency causes vacuole fragmentation. DISCUSSIONBecause mitochondria are the primary intracellular sources of superoxide radicals, we anticipated mitochondrial damage insod1Δ yeast. However, the most obvious sod1Δdefects were not in the mitochondria, but rather in the vacuole. Oxidative stress to Sod1p-deficient yeast leads to vacuolar fragmentation through an iron-dependent process. Evidence that the vacuole fragmentation is oxygen (presumably superoxide radical) mediated includes the findings that only aerobically grownsod1Δ yeast exhibit aberrant vacuoles and genetic supressors (such as pmr1Δ) capable of rescuing all other known aerobic sod1Δ deficits can also rescue this fragmentation phenotype. Iron deprivation (as in fet3Δ sod1Δ strains) also alleviates the fragmentation without providing resistance to O⨪2 generating reagents or ameliorating other oxygen-dependent phenotypes of sod1Δyeast. Thus, reactive oxygen species arising in the absence of Sod1p, in combination with iron, provoke damage to vacuoles.The notion of iron exacerbating damage under conditions of oxidative stress has been raised previously in other contexts. Fe2+can react with physiological levels of H2O2(and possibly other reactive oxygen species) to produce toxic hydroxyl radicals (reviewed in Ref. 48Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (4414) Google Scholar). In vivo, iron is not found typically in a free state but is sequestered as iron complexes or is bound protectively to enzymes, proteins, or iron carriers (for review, see Refs. 48Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (4414) Google Scholar and 52Kaplan J. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1996; 271: 1510-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, superoxide can alter this cellular iron homeostasis. Several groups have found in vivo evidence that superoxide radicals oxidize labile iron-sulfur clusters to liberate iron (1Flint D.H. Tuminello J.F. Emptage M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22369-22376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Flint D. Smyk-Randall E. Tuminello J.F. Draczynska-Lusiak B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 1478-1483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) although the fate and redox state of the “liberated” iron is not known. Additionally, genetic screens have found that mutations in iron-sulfur cluster assembly proteins lessen oxidative damage in sod1Δ yeast, suggesting that reducing the number of iron-sulfur targets for oxygen radical damage lessens damage in these oxidatively stressed cells (53Strain J. Lorenz C.R. Bode J. Garland S. Smolen G.A. Ta D.T. Vickery L.E. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31138-31144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Similarly, superoxide radicals have been shown to oxidize iron storage components to liberate iron which is released in a form capable of catalyzing hydroxyl radical production (54Biemond P. Eijk H.G.v. Swaak A.J. Koster J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 73: 1576-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). More generally, Wisnicka et al. (40Wisnicka R. Krzepilko A. Wawryn J. Krawiec Z. Bilinski T. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1998; 44: 635-641PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested that superoxide radicals (in sod1Δ yeast) may influence the redox status of cellular iron pools by reducing Fe3+ to the more reactive Fe2+ state. Although total iron is not elevated in sod1Δyeast, 2V. C. Culotta, unpublished results. the cellular distribution of iron, the ratio of ferrous to ferric iron, and the level of free iron may be altered. In any case, much evidence does suggest that oxygen radicals liberate iron which in turn may exacerbate oxidative damage.In yeast, the vacuole plays a role in iron homeostasis. Subcellular fractionation of iron-loaded cells suggests that the vacuole is the major site of iron sequestration (18Raguzzi F. Lesuisse E. Crichton R.R. FEBS Lett. 1988; 231: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and yeast lacking a recognizable vacuole structure are unable to accumulate high levels of iron (19Bode H.P. Dumschat M. Garotti S. Fuhrmann G.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, an iron-enriched yeast vacuole may be particularly susceptible to iron-mediated damage in superoxide-rich sod1Δ yeast. One possibility is that the vacuole damage may result from a disruption of the iron storage state in the vacuole. Under the influence of increased superoxide levels (which perhaps may be found throughout the Sod1p-deficient cell), vacuolar iron pools may be converted to a more accessible and active Fe2+ state that can catalyze hydroxyl radical production and damage macromolecules in the immediate vicinity of the vacuole. A second, not mutually exclusive, possibility is that alterations in iron handling and homeostasis within the cell may result in an increased trafficking of free iron to the vacuole. Increased vacuolar iron may result in increased iron-mediated oxidative reactions within the vacuole or alternatively, the increased iron may simply bind nonproductively to various sites in the vacuole (i.e.sulfur, nitrogen, or oxygen containing ligands). We cannot rule out the possibility that the primary damage actually occurs to cytosolic components that then secondarily afflict vacuolar structure and function. Indeed, we should stress, however, that there is not a global defect in trafficking to the vacuole or vacuole assembly as judged by normal carboxypeptidase Y trafficking results. In any case, both reactive oxygen species and iron contribute to vacuole changes.Iron-mediated damage occurs not just in the yeast vacuole but also in the mammalian analogue, the lysosome. Similar to the yeast vacuole, the lysosome plays a role in intracellular iron storage, homeostasis, and detoxification (55Radisky D.C. Kaplan J. Biochem.

Iron overload in the rat liver has been shown to increase lysosomal fragility (56LeSage G.D. Kost L.J. Barham S.S. LaRusso N.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 90-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Although lysosomal fragility has been partially attributed to lipid peroxidation, we should stress that similar lipid membrane damage is not the cause of sod1Δvacuole abnormalities because S. cerevisiae do not synthesize the polyunsaturated fatty acids that are susceptible to lipid peroxidation (57Bilinski T. Litwinska J. Blaszczynski M. Bajus A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1001: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Damage to vacuolar membrane proteins (as well as lysosomal membrane proteins) is a more likely possibility.By examining structural changes in cellular architecture caused by Sod1p deficiency, we have uncovered a plausible explanation for various puzzling defects in the sod1Δ yeast: some of the pleiotropic sod1Δ phenotypes may arise as secondary consequences of a compromised vacuole. For example, sod1Δyeast have a sporulation defect (16Liu X.F. Elashvili I. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Lapinskas P. Culotta V.C. J. Biol.

Previously, this sensitivity to adverse conditions was attributed to mitochondrial insufficiency (16Liu X.F. Elashvili I. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Lapinskas P. Culotta V.C. J. Biol.

However, although sod1Δ yeast do not grow as robustly on non-fermentable carbon sources as wild-type yeast, they nevertheless are respiration proficient (e.g. Ref. 15Gralla E.B. Kosman D.J. Adv.

When yeast are exposed to such adverse conditions, they normally up-regulate vacuolar hydrolases to turnover intravacuolar reserves and cytosolic macromolecules in order to recycle necessary nutrients (36Achstetter T. Wolf D.H. Yeast. 1985; 1: 139-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 37Jones E.W. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1984; 18: 233-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 38Teichert U. Mechler B. Muller H. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16037-16045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that the sod1Δ yeast cannot survive through such starvation conditions may be an indication that either vacuolar nutrient storage or the vacuolar-dependent macromolecular turnover processes are compromised. Indeed, many known vacuolar mutants also cannot survive adverse conditions (39Preston R.A. Manolson M.F. Becherer K. Weidenhammer E. Kirkpatrick D. Wright R. Jones E.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5801-5812Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we demonstrate that sod1Δ yeast have a sensitivity to pH which cannot easily be explained without invoking the role of the vacuole in pH homeostasis. Likewise, an increased sensitivity to transition metals may be directly or indirectly related to vacuole abnormalities. Thus, some of the curious metabolic and biochemical abnormalities in sod1Δ yeast may in fact be attributable to vacuolar aberrations.In summary, we demonstrate that oxidative stress to sod1Δyeast results in vacuolar fragmentation and either removal of oxygen or iron can ameliorate the damage. This may have medical relevance in that oxidative damage and alterations in iron homeostasis have been implicated in a number of disease states including atherosclerosis, neurodegeneration, arthritis, and aging (for review, see Ref. 48Halliwell B.

For example, brain and spinal cord deterioration after ischemic or traumatic injury often appears excessive for the level of trauma (58Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C.

Eijk H.G.v. Swaak A.J. Koster J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 73: 1576-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). More generally, Wisnicka et al. (40Wisnicka R. Krzepilko A. Wawryn J. Krawiec Z. Bilinski T. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1998; 44: 635-641PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested that superoxide radicals (in sod1Δ yeast) may influence the redox status of cellular iron pools by reducing Fe3+ to the more reactive Fe2+ state. Although total iron is not elevated in sod1Δyeast, 2V. C. Culotta, unpublished results. the cellular distribution of iron, the ratio of ferrous to ferric iron, and the level of free iron may be altered. In any case, much evidence does suggest that oxygen radicals liberate iron which in turn may exacerbate oxidative damage. In yeast, the vacuole plays a role in iron homeostasis. Subcellular fractionation of iron-loaded cells suggests that the vacuole is the major site of iron sequestration (18Raguzzi F. Lesuisse E. Crichton R.R. FEBS Lett. 1988; 231: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and yeast lacking a recognizable vacuole structure are unable to accumulate high levels of iron (19Bode H.P. Dumschat M. Garotti S. Fuhrmann G.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, an iron-enriched yeast vacuole may be particularly susceptible to iron-mediated damage in superoxide-rich sod1Δ yeast. One possibility is that the vacuole damage may result from a disruption of the iron storage state in the vacuole. Under the influence of increased superoxide levels (which perhaps may be found throughout the Sod1p-deficient cell), vacuolar iron pools may be converted to a more accessible and active Fe2+ state that can catalyze hydroxyl radical production and damage macromolecules in the immediate vicinity of the vacuole. A second, not mutually exclusive, possibility is that alterations in iron handling and homeostasis within the cell may result in an increased trafficking of free iron to the vacuole. Increased vacuolar iron may result in increased iron-mediated oxidative reactions within the vacuole or alternatively, the increased iron may simply bind nonproductively to various sites in the vacuole (i.e.sulfur, nitrogen, or oxygen containing ligands). We cannot rule out the possibility that the primary damage actually occurs to cytosolic components that then secondarily afflict vacuolar structure and function. Indeed, we should stress, however, that there is not a global defect in trafficking to the vacuole or vacuole assembly as judged by normal carboxypeptidase Y trafficking results. In any case, both reactive oxygen species and iron contribute to vacuole changes. Iron-mediated damage occurs not just in the yeast vacuole but also in the mammalian analogue, the lysosome. Similar to the yeast vacuole, the lysosome plays a role in intracellular iron storage, homeostasis, and detoxification (55Radisky D.C. Kaplan J. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 56LeSage G.D. Kost L.J. Barham S.S. LaRusso N.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 90-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Iron overload in the rat liver has been shown to increase lysosomal fragility (56LeSage G.D. Kost L.J. Barham S.S. LaRusso N.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 90-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Although lysosomal fragility has been partially attributed to lipid peroxidation, we should stress that similar lipid membrane damage is not the cause of sod1Δvacuole abnormalities because S. cerevisiae do not synthesize the polyunsaturated fatty acids that are susceptible to lipid peroxidation (57Bilinski T. Litwinska J. Blaszczynski M. Bajus A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1001: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Damage to vacuolar membrane proteins (as well as lysosomal membrane proteins) is a more likely possibility. By examining structural changes in cellular architecture caused by Sod1p deficiency, we have uncovered a plausible explanation for various puzzling defects in the sod1Δ yeast: some of the pleiotropic sod1Δ phenotypes may arise as secondary consequences of a compromised vacuole. For example, sod1Δyeast have a sporulation defect (16Liu X.F. Elashvili I. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Lapinskas P. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18298-18302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and an increased death rate upon entering stationary phase (17Longo V.D. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12275-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Previously, this sensitivity to adverse conditions was attributed to mitochondrial insufficiency (16Liu X.F. Elashvili I. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Lapinskas P. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18298-18302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Longo V.D. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12275-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). However, although sod1Δ yeast do not grow as robustly on non-fermentable carbon sources as wild-type yeast, they nevertheless are respiration proficient (e.g. Ref. 15Gralla E.B. Kosman D.J. Adv. Genet. 1992; 30: 251-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Instead, we suggest these sod1Δ abnormalities may be, in part, vacuole related. When yeast are exposed to such adverse conditions, they normally up-regulate vacuolar hydrolases to turnover intravacuolar reserves and cytosolic macromolecules in order to recycle necessary nutrients (36Achstetter T. Wolf D.H. Yeast. 1985; 1: 139-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 37Jones E.W. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1984; 18: 233-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 38Teichert U. Mechler B. Muller H. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16037-16045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that the sod1Δ yeast cannot survive through such starvation conditions may be an indication that either vacuolar nutrient storage or the vacuolar-dependent macromolecular turnover processes are compromised. Indeed, many known vacuolar mutants also cannot survive adverse conditions (39Preston R.A. Manolson M.F. Becherer K. Weidenhammer E. Kirkpatrick D. Wright R. Jones E.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5801-5812Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we demonstrate that sod1Δ yeast have a sensitivity to pH which cannot easily be explained without invoking the role of the vacuole in pH homeostasis. Likewise, an increased sensitivity to transition metals may be directly or indirectly related to vacuole abnormalities. Thus, some of the curious metabolic and biochemical abnormalities in sod1Δ yeast may in fact be attributable to vacuolar aberrations. In summary, we demonstrate that oxidative stress to sod1Δyeast results in vacuolar fragmentation and either removal of oxygen or iron can ameliorate the damage. This may have medical relevance in that oxidative damage and alterations in iron homeostasis have been implicated in a number of disease states including atherosclerosis, neurodegeneration, arthritis, and aging (for review, see Ref. 48Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (4414) Google Scholar). In some cases oxidative insult is thought to be the primary cause of damage. For example, brain and spinal cord deterioration after ischemic or traumatic injury often appears excessive for the level of trauma (58Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Trends Neurosci. 1985; 8: 22Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (787) Google Scholar). One explanation put forth is that iron-binding capacity in the central nervous system and in the cerebral spinal fluid bathing the central nervous system is particularly low. Thus, release of iron by oxidatively or mechanically damaged cells, organelles, and proteins may catalyze toxic oxidative side reactions causing further cell injury. Consistent with this concept, preliminary trials of treatment with iron-chelating agents have had success in diminishing post-traumatic degeneration of brain and spinal cord (59Hall E.D. J. Neurosurg. 1988; 68: 462-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 60Hall E.D. Yonkers P.A. McCall J.M. Braughler J.M. J. Neurosurg. 1988; 68: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Thus, iron-mediated oxidative damage is likely a common event in aerobic organisms, and dissection and understanding of the process (and ways of prevention) in yeast may give insight into human disease.

Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein glutathioneS-transferase lysophosphatidic acid mitogen-activated protein MAP kinase kinase platelet-derived growth factor baby hamster kidney hemagglutinin Madin-Darby canine kidney Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP)1 has been identified as the gene product whose mutation causes a human hereditary disease, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (1Derry J.M. Ochs H.D. Francke U. Cell. 1994; 78: 635-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression studies revealed that WASP induces the formation of clusters of actin filaments in a manner dependent on Cdc42, a Rho family small GTPase (2Symons M. Derry J.M. Karlak B. Jiang S. Lemahieu V. McCormick F. Francke U. Abo A. Cell. 1996; 84: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Soon after the discovery of WASP, we identified a WASP-related molecule in a search of Grb2/Ash-binding proteins (3Miki H. Miura K. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5326-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). This novel protein, named neural WASP (N-WASP), has been shown to function downstream of Cdc42 to induce the formation of actin microspikes (filopodia) (4Miki H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Takenawa T. Nature. 1998; 391: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). At the carboxyl-terminal regions of both WASP and N-WASP, there exist verprolin homology domains that are homologous to one part of verprolin, a yeast protein that regulates the actin cytoskeleton (5Donnelly S.F. Pocklington M.J. Pallotta D. Orr E. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 585-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar,6Vaduva G. Martin N.C. Hopper A.K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1821-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that the verprolin homology domain in N-WASP directly binds to actin (7Miki H. Takenawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).To identify a novel WASP-related molecule, we performed a data base search using the verprolin homology domain amino acid sequence and identified WAVE (WASP-family verprolin homologous protein), which was originally isolated in a random cDNA sequencing project as KIAA0269 (8Nagase T. Seki N. Ishikawa K. Ohira M. Kawarabayasi Y. Ohara O. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Miyajima N. Nomura N. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 9Miki H. Suetsugu S. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6932-6941Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal half of WAVE was structurally similar to both WASP and N-WASP, in that WAVE also possesses the verprolin homology domain and a proline-rich region. Thus, WAVE was thought to be a new member of the WASP family of proteins.We then demonstrated that WAVE regulates the actin reorganization that is essential for the formation of membrane ruffles induced by Rac, another Rho family member (9Miki H. Suetsugu S. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6932-6941Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Recently, Machesky and Insall (10Machesky L.M. Insall R.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1347-1356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar) reported that the carboxyl-terminal fragment of WAVE (they call the same protein Hs-Scar1) binds to Arp2/3 protein complex and that the ectopic expression of the fragment suppresses the PDGF-induced formation of membrane ruffles. Because PDGF-induced membrane-ruffling formation occurs in a Rac-dependent manner (11Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3050) Google Scholar), this result also supports the possibility that WAVE functions downstream of Rac.Thus, all WASP family proteins have been shown to regulate the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton downstream of Cdc42 or Rac, and Cdc42 has been shown to bind directly to WASP and N-WASP (2Symons M.

Biol. 1996; 6: 70-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). In contrast, we could not detect any direct interaction between WAVE and Rac by conventional far Western blot assay, and the regulation mechanism of WAVE remains unclear.To understand its regulation mechanism, we have examined here whether WAVE is modified in response to external stimuli that cause membrane ruffling. As a result, we found that WAVE is hyperphosphorylated by various signals that activate a MAP kinase signaling cascade.DISCUSSIONMAP kinase is a protein kinase that is activated by various external stimuli and regulates many fundamental processes such as cell growth and differentiation. The best known function of MAP kinase is to receive signals from Ras and transmit the signal to the nucleus, regulating transcription of specific genes that affect the fate of cells. However, there has been accumulating evidence that MAP kinase not only transmits the signal to the nucleus but also regulates cytoplasmic events such as cell motility (25Klemke R.L. Cai S. Giannini A.L. Gallagher P.J. de Lanerolle P. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar).We found in this study that suppression of MAP kinase activation resulted in significant, though not perfect, reduction of membrane ruffling. WAVE is a strong candidate for a downstream target of MAP kinase for proper formation of membrane ruffles, because WAVE is hyperphosphorylated downstream of MAP kinase signaling and has been shown to be a critical regulator of membrane ruffling downstream of Rac (9Miki H. Suetsugu S. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6932-6941Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). The WAVE hyperphosphorylation seems to inhibit specifically the association with Grb2/Ash, although we do not know yet the physiological relevance of this inhibition. It is quite probable that Grb2/Ash recruits WAVE to the activated PDGF receptor through the association between the SH3 domains and the proline-rich region as in the case of Sos (26Rozakis-Adcock M. Fernley R. Wade J. Pawson T. Bowtell D. Nature. 1993; 363: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 27Li N. Batzer A. Daly R. Yajnik V. Skolnik E. Chardin P. Bar-Sagi D. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1993; 363: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar), a well known Ras activator. The hyperphosphorylation that follows by MAP kinase pathway may free WAVE from Grb2/Ash, and then WAVE may become fully active in inducing the membrane-ruffling formation.However, it should be noted that the hyperphosphorylation of WAVE is not required for membrane-ruffling formation. As described above, PD98059 treatment could only partially suppress the membrane-ruffling formation. Furthermore, the WAVE hyperphosphorylation is not sufficient for membrane ruffling. Indeed, stimulation of cells with LPA or serum, both of which induce significant WAVE hyperphosphorylation, does not induce membrane ruffling. More directly, we confirmed that expression of active MEK alone did not induce membrane ruffling (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that the Rac pathway is the main route to induction of the membrane-ruffling formation and that the MAP kinase pathway modulates the signaling cascade at some points including WAVE. Now we do not know how WAVE is regulated by Rac. Because WAVE and Rac can form protein complexes when co-expressed in COS 7 cells (9Miki H. Suetsugu S. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6932-6941Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar), some adaptor molecule may link between Rac and WAVE. We have performed two-hybrid screening using various parts of WAVE as bait and identified several WAVE-specific binding proteins including known and unknown ones (data not shown), among which we hope the “linking protein” exists.The important question is what kinase “directly” hyperphosphorylates WAVE. We performed an in vitro kinase assay using activated MAP kinase purified from Xenopusoocyte extracts and found that it indeed phosphorylates the carboxyl-terminal GST fusion fragment of WAVE (data not shown). However, the phosphorylation efficiency was very weak (< 150the phosphorylation efficiency of myelin basic protein). More importantly, the full-length WAVE protein immunoprecipitated from Swiss 3T3 cells not treated with PDGF was not phosphorylated at all (data not shown). Thus, it is questionable that MAP kinase itself directly hyperphosphorylates WAVE. Several kinases have been found to be activated downstream of MAP kinases (28Stokoe D. Campbell D.G. Nakielny S. Hidaka H. Leevers S.J. Marshall C. Cohen P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3985-3994Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), and we think that such a kinase(s) phosphorylates WAVE.WAVE mobility shift occurs not only in cells stimulated with growth factors but also in oncogenically transformed cells. It has been shown that a MAP kinase cascade is essential for oncogenic transformation by various oncogenes (29Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1845) Google Scholar). In addition, LA-SDSE mutant MEK, which is constitutively active and can remain in the nucleus, can transform NIH3T3 fibroblasts by itself (19Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1942-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Rac has also been demonstrated to be involved in transformation. For example, expression of the dominant negative form of Rac can suppress transformation by oncogenic Ras (30Qiu R.G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons M. Nature. 1995; 374: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). Rac also participates in invasion of carcinoma cells into normal tissues (31Shaw L.M. Rabinovitz I. Wang H.H. Toker A. Mercurio A.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 949-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Thus, taken together, this information suggests that both MAP kinase and Rac produce critical signals inducing oncogenic transformation. Considering this, we conclude that WAVE might be a critical regulator of tumorigenesis by integrating two important signals for transformation, MAP kinase and Rac. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP)1 has been identified as the gene product whose mutation causes a human hereditary disease, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (1Derry J.M. Ochs H.D. Francke U.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6932-6941Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar), some adaptor molecule may link between Rac and WAVE. We have performed two-hybrid screening using various parts of WAVE as bait and identified several WAVE-specific binding proteins including known and unknown ones (data not shown), among which we hope the “linking protein” exists.The important question is what kinase “directly” hyperphosphorylates WAVE. We performed an in vitro kinase assay using activated MAP kinase purified from Xenopusoocyte extracts and found that it indeed phosphorylates the carboxyl-terminal GST fusion fragment of WAVE (data not shown). However, the phosphorylation efficiency was very weak (< 150the phosphorylation efficiency of myelin basic protein). More importantly, the full-length WAVE protein immunoprecipitated from Swiss 3T3 cells not treated with PDGF was not phosphorylated at all (data not shown). Thus, it is questionable that MAP kinase itself directly hyperphosphorylates WAVE. Several kinases have been found to be activated downstream of MAP kinases (28Stokoe D. Campbell D.G. Nakielny S. Hidaka H. Leevers S.J. Marshall C. Cohen P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3985-3994Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), and we think that such a kinase(s) phosphorylates WAVE.WAVE mobility shift occurs not only in cells stimulated with growth factors but also in oncogenically transformed cells. It has been shown that a MAP kinase cascade is essential for oncogenic transformation by various oncogenes (29Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1845) Google Scholar). In addition, LA-SDSE mutant MEK, which is constitutively active and can remain in the nucleus, can transform NIH3T3 fibroblasts by itself (19Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1942-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Rac has also been demonstrated to be involved in transformation. For example, expression of the dominant negative form of Rac can suppress transformation by oncogenic Ras (30Qiu R.G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons M. Nature. 1995; 374: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). Rac also participates in invasion of carcinoma cells into normal tissues (31Shaw L.M. Rabinovitz I. Wang H.H. Toker A. Mercurio A.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 949-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Thus, taken together, this information suggests that both MAP kinase and Rac produce critical signals inducing oncogenic transformation. Considering this, we conclude that WAVE might be a critical regulator of tumorigenesis by integrating two important signals for transformation, MAP kinase and Rac. MAP kinase is a protein kinase that is activated by various external stimuli and regulates many fundamental processes such as cell growth and differentiation. The best known function of MAP kinase is to receive signals from Ras and transmit the signal to the nucleus, regulating transcription of specific genes that affect the fate of cells. However, there has been accumulating evidence that MAP kinase not only transmits the signal to the nucleus but also regulates cytoplasmic events such as cell motility (25Klemke R.L. Cai S. Giannini A.L. Gallagher P.J. de Lanerolle P. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). We found in this study that suppression of MAP kinase activation resulted in significant, though not perfect, reduction of membrane ruffling. WAVE is a strong candidate for a downstream target of MAP kinase for proper formation of membrane ruffles, because WAVE is hyperphosphorylated downstream of MAP kinase signaling and has been shown to be a critical regulator of membrane ruffling downstream of Rac (9Miki H. Suetsugu S. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6932-6941Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). The WAVE hyperphosphorylation seems to inhibit specifically the association with Grb2/Ash, although we do not know yet the physiological relevance of this inhibition. It is quite probable that Grb2/Ash recruits WAVE to the activated PDGF receptor through the association between the SH3 domains and the proline-rich region as in the case of Sos (26Rozakis-Adcock M. Fernley R. Wade J. Pawson T. Bowtell D. Nature. 1993; 363: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 27Li N. Batzer A. Daly R. Yajnik V. Skolnik E. Chardin P. Bar-Sagi D. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1993; 363: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar), a well known Ras activator. The hyperphosphorylation that follows by MAP kinase pathway may free WAVE from Grb2/Ash, and then WAVE may become fully active in inducing the membrane-ruffling formation. However, it should be noted that the hyperphosphorylation of WAVE is not required for membrane-ruffling formation. As described above, PD98059 treatment could only partially suppress the membrane-ruffling formation. Furthermore, the WAVE hyperphosphorylation is not sufficient for membrane ruffling. Indeed, stimulation of cells with LPA or serum, both of which induce significant WAVE hyperphosphorylation, does not induce membrane ruffling. More directly, we confirmed that expression of active MEK alone did not induce membrane ruffling (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that the Rac pathway is the main route to induction of the membrane-ruffling formation and that the MAP kinase pathway modulates the signaling cascade at some points including WAVE. Now we do not know how WAVE is regulated by Rac. Because WAVE and Rac can form protein complexes when co-expressed in COS 7 cells (9Miki H. Suetsugu S. Takenawa T.

Bioessays. 1995; 17: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). However, there is still uncertainty concerning the mechanisms by which the one second messenger Ca2+ can exert specific effects on discrete intracellular signal pathways that have to be decoded by downstream effectors. Recently, some evidence has emerged that the amplitude and duration of [Ca2+]isignals mediates the differential activation of different transcription factors, indicating that Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and subsequent Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane activate distinct transcriptional pathways (2Dolmetsch R.E. Lewis R.E. Goodnow C.C. Healy J.I. Nature. 1997; 386: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar).

The action of ROS in signaling pathways involves [Ca2+]i fluctuations in a variety of preparations (15Volk T. Hensel M. Kox W.J. Mol.

Interferon Cytokine Res. 1996; 16: 77-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), indicating a fine-tuned interplay between ROS and Ca2+ that may result in a distinct pattern of either gene activation or down-regulation of transcriptional activity. We have recently shown that 100 nmH2O2 caused release of [Ca2+]i from intracellular thapsigargin-sensitive stores of Du-145 prostate cancer cells grown to the three-dimensional tissue of multicellular tumor spheroids (19Sauer H. Diedershagen H. Hescheler J. Wartenberg M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Following H2O2 treatment, a transient up-regulation of c-Fos and a faster kinetics of tumor growth was observed. In the present study treatment of multicellular spheroids with 200 μm H2O2 resulted in tumor growth depression and up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27kip1. p27kip1 acts as a negative regulator of G1 progression (20Kwon T.K. Buchholz M.A. Chrest F.J. Nordin A.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1305-1313PubMed Google Scholar) and has been suggested to be associated with intrinsic multidrug resistance in three-dimensional tumor tissues (21St. Croix B. Fl℘renes V.A. Rak J.W. Flanagan M. Bhattacharya N. Slingerland J.M. Kerbel R.S. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1204-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Under these experimental conditions Ca2+ release from intracellular stores was followed by a prolonged period of Ca2+ influx. Since our previous studies demonstrated that the effect of H2O2 on the growth stimulation of tumor spheroids was Ca2+-dependent we tested whether cell cycle activation by 100 nm to 1 μmH2O2 versus cell cycle arrest and induction of cell quiescence by 200 μmH2O2 was owing to the nature of the H2O2-induced Ca2+ response. Our data indicate that the [Ca2+]i release phase of the [Ca2+]i response initiates cell cycle activity. On the other hand prolonged Ca2+ influx is mediating cell cycle arrest, which consequently results in the depression of tumor growth. The human prostate cancer cell line DU-145 was kindly provided by Dr. J. Carlsson, Uppsala, Sweden. The cell line was grown routinely in 5% CO2, humidified air at 37 °C with Ham's F-10 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 2 mm glutamine, 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm minimal essential medium, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (ICN Flow, Meckenheim, Germany). Spheroids were grown from single cells. Cell monolayers were enzymatically dissociated with 0.2% trypsin, 0.05% EDTA (ICN Flow) and seeded in siliconated 250-ml spinner flasks (Integra Biosciences, Fernwald, Germany) with 250 ml of complete medium and agitated at 20 rpm using a Cell-spin stirrer system (Integra Biosciences, Fernwald). Cell culture medium was partially (100 ml) changed every day. Small multicellular spheroids (diameter 60 ± 20 μm) were washed in F-10 cell culture medium. They were placed in 8.5-cm diameter plastic nonadhesive culture dishes (Greiner, Solingen, Germany) and incubated for 1 h in E1 medium containing 135 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4 at 37 °C) and supplemented with different concentrations of H2O2 (Sigma) as indicated. In experiments with nominally Ca2+-free solution, CaCl2 was omitted from the incubation medium. The protein kinase C inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide I (1 μm) and H-7 (10 μm) (both from Calbiochem-Novabiochem) were added to the spheroids 1 h before the addition of H2O2. Spheroids were subsequently washed three times in F-10 medium and cultivated in liquid overlay culture. Incubation with ATP (Sigma) was performed in F-10 cell culture medium. ATP was present during an incubation period of 24 h. Spheroid diameters in control and treated samples were monitored every 24 h. Spheroid volumes were calculated according to V = 4/3·π·r 3. H2O2 did not per se influence the volumes of tumor spheroids. The lifetime of H2O2 in E1 buffer was determined by a luminol-dependent chemiluminescence assay (22Wymann M.P. von Tscharner V. Deranleau D.A. Baggiolini M. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 165: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In E1 buffer, no H2O2 degradation within 1 h of incubation was observed (data not shown). [Ca2+]i was monitored using the fluorescent dye fluo-3, AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Multicellular spheroids were mounted to poly-l-lysine (Sigma)-coated coverslips and were subsequently loaded for 60 min in F-10 cell culture medium with 10 μm fluo-3, AM, dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (final concentration 0.1%) and pluronicTM F-127, which facilitates the solubilization of fluo-3, AM (final concentration <0.025%). After loading, the spheroids were rinsed three times in E1 buffer. Superfusion was performed by gravity at a rate of 10 ml/min. A 90% volume exchange was achieved within 10 s. The experiments were performed at 37 °C. Fluorescence data were recorded using an inverted confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM 410; Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with a 25× objective, numerical aperture 0.80 (Plan-Neofluar, Zeiss). Fluorescence was excited by the 488-nm line of an argon-ion laser. Emission was recorded using a LP 515-nm filter set. Processing of images (512 × 512 pixels, 8 bit) was carried out by the Time-software facilities of the confocal setup. Full-frame images were acquired and stored automatically at 4-s intervals to a 16-megabyte video memory of the confocal setup. The minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation, and integrated sum of the pixel values in a region of interest (selected using an overlay mask) were written to a data file and routinely exported for further analysis to the commercially available Sigma Plot (Jandel Scientific, Erkrath, Germany) graphic software. Because fluo-3 does not permit the use of ratio measurements, data are presented in arbitrary units as the percentage of fluorescence variation (F/F 0) with respect to the resting level F 0, which was set to 100%. The c-Fos (AB-2) polyclonal antibody (5 μg/ml) was obtained from Calbiochem). The monoclonal antibody anti-p27kip1 was obtained from Pharmingen (Hamburg, Germany) and used in a concentration of 2.5 μg/ml. The anti-active MAPK polyclonal antibody directed against ERK1, -2 (dilution 1:20), and the anti-active JNK (dilution 1:20) polyclonal antibody were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). The polyclonal anti-active p38 MAPK (dilution 1:20) and MEK1, -2 (dilution 1:20) antibodies were obtained from Calbiochem. Antibody staining was performed on whole-mount multicellular spheroids. As secondary antibodies, a Cy3TM-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA), concentration 1.2 μg/ml, and a Cy5TM-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragment goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), concentration 3.25 μg/ml, were used. Excitation was performed using a 543-nm and a 633-nm helium-neon laser of the confocal setup. Emission was recorded using LP570 and LP655 nm filter sets, respectively. For quantitative immunohistochemistry, confocal images of whole mount multicellular spheroids stained with only secondary antibodies (background fluorescence image) and spheroids stained with primary and secondary antibodies were recorded. The pinhole settings of the confocal setup were adjusted to yield optical slices of 20-μm thickness. After subtraction of background fluorescence, the fluorescence signal (counts) was evaluated in 500-μm2areas of interest by the image analysis software of the confocal setup and was routinely exported for further analysis to the Sigma Plot graphic software. Multicellular spheroids treated with H2O2 and untreated controls were lysed in 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerine, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% bromphenol blue. Equal amounts of proteins (15 μg/lane) were electrophoresed on 10 or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Immunoblots of c-Fos and p27kip1 were prepared by electrophoretic transfer of proteins from SDS-polyacrylamide gels to nitrocellulose by semi-dry Western blotting. The nitrocellulose transfers were incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer (5% lowfat milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20) and then probed for 1 h with 1:300 dilution of polyclonal rabbit anti-c-Fos in blocking buffer or 1:200 dilution of monoclonal anti-p27kip1 in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20. As secondary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit (dilution 1:2 × 104) or mouse (dilution 1:1 × 104) antibodies were used. Data are given as mean values ± S.D., with n denoting the number of experiments that were performed with at least three independent tumor spheroid cultures. Student's t test for unpaired data was applied as appropriate. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. The initial phases (day 1 to day 6) of tumor growth follow an exponential growth kinetics with volume-doubling times of approximately 24 h (19Sauer H. Diedershagen H. Hescheler J. Wartenberg M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). With the development of quiescent cell areas, which has been previously shown to occur at spheroid diameters of approximately 180 μm (23Sauer H. Ritgen J. Hescheler J. Wartenberg M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 175: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), growth retardation occurs, and the volume-doubling times increased to 96 ± 30 h (n = 3) (Fig.1 A). By quantitative immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting, a correlation between the growth kinetics of multicellular tumor spheroids and the expression of p27kip1 became obvious (Fig. 1, B and C). Our data indicate that p27kip1 protein levels continuously increased during the first 6 days of spheroids culture. From day 7 on, i.e the time where growth retardation of multicellular tumor spheroids occurred, the increases of p27kip1 protein levels were apparently more pronounced, indicating that with a critical diameter of approximately 180 μm, quiescent cells develop in the tumor tissue of multicellular spheroids. We have recently reported that nanomolar concentrations of H2O2 induced an enhancement of the growth kinetics of multicellular tumor spheroids (19Sauer H. Diedershagen H. Hescheler J. Wartenberg M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To evaluate the differential activation of cell proliferationversus cell quiescence by H2O2, multicellular tumor spheroids with a mean size of 60 ± 20 μm were incubated for 1 h with varying doses of H2O2 ranging from 10 nm to 200 μm, and spheroid size was recorded 24 h thereafter. Fig. 2 A shows that 100 nm to 1 μm H2O2significantly stimulated tumor growth, whereas H2O2 concentrations exceeding 100 μm led to significant growth depression as compared with the control in the absence of H2O2(n = at least 7 for each experimental condition). Growth stimulation by H2O2 was apparently mediated via activation of protein kinase C, since preincubation with 1 μm bisindolylmaleimide I (n = 3) (Fig.2 B) and 10 μm H7 (not shown) inhibited the observed effects. Furthermore, activation of JNK, MEK1,2, ERK1, -2, but not p38 MAPK (not shown) was observed (Fig. 2 C). MEK1, -2 and ERK1, -2 activation occurred after incubation with 1 μm and 200 μm H2O2and was at its maximum 10 and 30 min, respectively, after the addition of H2O2 to the incubation medium. Activation of the ERK pathway was more pronounced with 200 μm as compared with 1 μm H2O2. JNK activation was observed 10 min after the addition of 1 μmH2O2 to the incubation medium, whereas 200 μm H2O2 did not exert significant effects (n = 3). To determine possible toxic effects of H2O2, lethal cell stainings were performed with the lethal cell stain ethidium homodimer-1 after 4 days of spheroid culture. No cell lethality was observed with H2O2 concentrations below 0.5 mm. Incubation for 1 h with 0.5 mm and 1 mm H2O2resulted in a cell lethality of 8 ± 5% and 43 ± 20%, respectively (n = 3) (data not shown). To exclude that 200 μm H2O2 induced apoptosis rather than cell dormancy, spheroids were screened for apoptosis 24 h after H2O2 exposure using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-X nick end-labeling (TUNEL). Under the applied experimental conditions, no apoptosis occurred (data not shown). Cell cycle progression has been shown to be dependent on changes in [Ca2+]i (24Husain M. Bein K. Alper S.L. Simons M. Rosenberg R.D. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 617-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 25Swanson C.A. Arkin A.P. Ross J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To evaluate the involvement of [Ca2+]i signals in the induction of either cell proliferation or cell quiescence by H2O2, single cell [Ca2+]ichanges were recorded in tumor spheroids incubated with different concentrations of H2O2 ranging from 100 nm to 500 μm. Nonlethal concentrations of H2O2 elicited a transient rise of [Ca2+]i (Fig. 3,A–C). The duration of the [Ca2+]iresponse increased with the concentration of H2O2 added to the incubation medium and amounted to 60 ± 16 s, 85 ± 26 s, 246 ± 57 s, 370 ± 70 s, and 590 ± 150 s for 100 nm, 1 μm, 10 μm, 100 μm, and 200 μmH2O2, respectively (Fig.4 A) (n = 4). Incubation of tumor spheroids with 500 μmH2O2, which exerted cytotoxic effects in part of the cells, resulted in a sustained rise of [Ca2+]i (not shown). The amplitude of the [Ca2+]i response was 37 ± 15%, 38 ± 20%, 45 ± 15%, 107 ± 28%, and 139 ± 34% that of the resting [Ca2+]i for 100 nm, 1 μm, 10 μm, 100 μm, and 200 μm H2O2, respectively (Fig.4 B) (n = 4).Figure 4Duration (A) and amplitude (B) of the single cell [Ca2+]iresponses elicited with different concentrations of H2O2 in multicellular tumor spheroids.Note that both the duration and the amplitude are enlarged with increasing concentrations of H2O2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The data of the present study show that the [Ca2+]i signals elicited by H2O2 are prolonged with rising concentrations of H2O2. To evaluate whether the prolonged [Ca2+]i responses were owing to the activation of Ca2+ influx, spheroids were treated with 200 μm H2O2 under Ca2+-free conditions and in the presence of either Ni2+ (1 mm) and La3+ (50 μm), which have been previously shown to inhibit Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane (28Shibuya I. Douglas W.W. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 1936-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), or SKF-96365 (10 μm), which is an inhibitor of nonselective Ca2+ entry (29Cabello O.A. Schilling W.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These conditions led to a significant shortening of the [Ca2+]i response, whereas its amplitude remained unchanged (Fig.5 A and B). The mean duration of the [Ca2+]i response under Ca2+-free conditions and in the presence of Ni2+, La3+, and SKF-96365 was 195 ± 65 s, 190 ± 30 s, 173 ± 35 s, and 194 ± 40 s, respectively (n = 4). A total inhibition of the [Ca2+]i response was obtained by preincubation with 2 μm carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone, which impairs the respiratory chain and depletes mitochondrial Ca2+ stores (data not shown). Hence, the [Ca2+]i signal elicited with 200 μm H2O2 is owing to mitochondrial Ca2+ release followed by prolonged Ca2+influx. The working hypothesis of the present study was the assumption that the switch between growth stimulation and induction of cell quiescence by H2O2 is encoded predominantly by the influx component of the [Ca2+]i response, which is, according to the model of capacitative Ca2+ entry proposed by Putney (30Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar), composed of Ca2+ release from intracellular stores followed by Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane. To validate this assumption, spheroids with a mean diameter of 60 ± 20 μm were treated with 200 μmH2O2 under conditions where Ca2+influx was inhibited, i.e. under Ca2+-free conditions, in the presence of Mn2+ (50 μm), La3+ (50 μm), and SKF-96365 (10 μm). Spheroid growth was evaluated after 24 h. Our data demonstrate that these conditions led to a significant enhancement of tumor growth as compared with both the untreated control and tumor spheroids treated with 200 μmH2O2 in the presence of 1.8 mmextracellular Ca2+ (n = 4) (Fig.6). The spheroid volumes amounted to 5.17 × 105 ± 1.9 × 105μm3, 5.75 × 105 ± 1.75 × 105 μm3, 6.46 × 105 ± 2.24 × 105 μm3, and 6.2 × 105± 2.16 × 105 μm3 for Ca2+-free conditions, La3+, Mn2+, and SKF-96365, respectively. This was in the same order of magnitude as achieved after incubation with 1 μmH2O2 (5.56 × 105 ± 2.02 × 105 μm3). The volumes of untreated control spheroids and spheroids treated with 200 μmH2O2 were significantly smaller and amounted to 2.57 × 105 ± 0.85 × 105μm3 and 1.24 × 105 ± 0.87 × 105 μm3, respectively. Taken together, our data suggest that under conditions where Ca2+ influx was inhibited, 200 μm H2O2 stimulated tumor growth to an extent not significantly different from spheroids treated with growth-stimulating concentrations (100 nm to 1 μm) of H2O2, which indicates that Ca2+ from intracellular stores resulted in cell cycle activation, whereas prolonged Ca2+ influx induced cell quiescence. The data of the present study demonstrate that treatment of multicellular tumor spheroids with 100 nm to 1 μm H2O2resulted in cell cycle activation and enhanced tumor growth. Induction of cell quiescence and growth retardation of tumor spheroids was achieved after incubation with 200 μmH2O2. Growth stimulation of multicellular tumor spheroids should therefore be accompanied by a down-regulation of the cyclin kinase inhibitor p27kip1 and up-regulation of the transcription factor c-Fos, which has been demonstrated to be involved in the induction of cell proliferation in multicellular Du-145 prostate tumor spheroids (31Sauer H. Hescheler J. Reis D. Diedershagen H. Niedermeier W. Wartenberg M. Br. J. Cancer. 1997; 75: 1481-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). On the other hand, induction of cell quiescence by 200 μm H2O2 should be mediated by p27kip1 up-regulation and down-regulation of Fos protein. Since inhibition of Ca2+ influx, which resulted in an abridgement of the Ca2+ response elicited by 200 μm H2O2, was followed by an enhancement of tumor growth, we expected an up-regulation of Fos protein levels and down-regulation of p27kip1 under these experimental conditions. To evaluate these issues, spheroids with a diameter of 60 ± 20 μm, which express moderate levels of p27kip1 (see Fig. 1), were incubated with either 100 nm or 200 μm H2O2 or 200 μm H2O2 in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Fos protein levels were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting 1 h after incubation with H2O2, and p27kip1 protein levels were evaluated 24 h thereafter. Fig. 7,A and B, demonstrates by quantitative immunohistochemistry that p27kip1 protein levels were down-regulated and Fos protein levels were up-regulated when spheroids were treated with cell proliferation-inducing nanomolar concentrations (100 nm) of H2O2 (n= 3). However, p27kip1 was up-regulated with tumor growth-depressing micromolar concentrations (200 μm) of H2O2, which consequently down-regulated Fos protein. Under Ca2+-free conditions, i.e. under conditions where Ca2+ influx was abolished, 200 μm H2O2 significantly down-regulated p27kip1 protein levels as compared with the untreated control sample and the sample treated with 200 μm H2O2 in the presence of 1.8 mm extracellular Ca2+. Under these conditions p27kip1 expression was not significantly different from the values achieved after stimulation of cell proliferation with 100 nm H2O2. Consequently, a significant up-regulation of Fos was observed, which is indicative for the induction of cell proliferation and tumor growth. The data obtained with quantitative immunohistochemistry and confocal laser-scanning microscopy could be confirmed by immunoblotting experiments (Fig.8, A and B) (n = 3). These findings clearly show that [Ca2+]i release from intracellular stores by H2O2 is encoding the induction of cell proliferation, whereas prolonged Ca2+ influx is involved in cell cycle arrest and the induction of cell quiescence.Figure 8c-Fos (A) and p27kip1 (B) immunoblots after treatment of multicellular tumor spheroids with different concentrations of H2O2. Blots were obtained from tumor spheroids treated with 100 nm and 200 μmH2O2. The incubations with 200 μmH2O2 were performed either in the absence or presence of extracellular Ca2+ to evaluate the effect of inhibition of Ca2+ influx pathways on the induction of cell proliferation. Note that incubation with proliferation-stimulating concentrations (100 nm) of H2O2resulted in up-regulation of c-Fos, whereas incubation with quiescence-inducing concentrations of H2O2 (200 μm) resulted in up-regulation of p27kip1 and down-regulation of c-Fos. Under Ca2+-free conditions, 200 μm H2O down-regulated p27kip1, whereas c-Fos was increased. *p < 0.05, significantly different from control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is possible that H2O2 recruits signals in addition to the characteristic [Ca2+]i patterns here described, which may be responsible for the observed effects on proliferation. To investigate this issue, tumor spheroids were incubated with ATP in concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 100 μm. It has been previously shown that in Du-145 prostate cancer cells P2u purinergic receptors are present, which upon activation lead to Ca2+ release from intracellular stores by an inositol trisphosphate-mediated mechanism (32Wasilenko W.J. Cooper J. Palad A.J. Somers K.D. Blackmore P.F. Rhim J.S. Whright Jr., G.L. Schellhammer P.F. Prostate. 1997; 30: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that incubation of tumor spheroids with 0.1 and 1 μm ATP significantly stimulated tumor growth, whereas a concentration of 100 μm ATP resulted in growth depression (n = 3) (Fig.9 A). As described previously (32Wasilenko W.J. Cooper J. Palad A.J. Somers K.D. Blackmore P.F. Rhim J.S. Whright Jr., G.L. Schellhammer P.F. Prostate. 1997; 30: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) ATP induced transient [Ca2+]i responses, which partially exerted oscillatory behavior. The duration of the [Ca2+]i responses increased with rising concentrations of ATP added to the incubation medium and amounted to 36 ± 11 s, 90 ± 80 s, 270 ± 112 s, and 645 ± 260 s for 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 μm ATP, respectively (n = 3) (Fig. 9 B). The duration of the [Ca2+]i responses elicited by 1 μm ATP, which exerted the most pronounced stimulatory effect on tumor growth, was not significantly different from the duration of the [Ca2+]i responses achieved with growth-stimulating concentrations of H2O2"

Measurements on MnSOD fromThermus thermophilus showed similar results (3Bull C. Niederhoffer E.C. Yoshida T. Fee J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4069-4076Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The maximal velocity of catalysis has rate-contributing proton transfer steps as determined by the solvent hydrogen isotope effect of 2.1 for the turnover number k cat for catalysis byT. thermophilus MnSOD (3Bull C. Niederhoffer E.C. Yoshida T. Fee J.A. J. Am. Chem.

Fee J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 3295-3304Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This protonation promotes the dissociation of product from the enzyme and perhaps decreases the extent of product inhibition. Recent studies using site-specific mutagenesis have clarified the role of Tyr34 in the active site of MnSOD showing that replacement of this residue with Phe leaves a mutant with considerable catalytic activity (5Hunter T. Ikebukuro K. Bannister W.H. Bannister J.V. Hunter G.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4925-4933Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 6Whittaker M.M. Whittaker J.W.

Tyr34 in human MnSOD has properties consistent with its participation in the proton transfer events reported by k cat; the replacement of Tyr34 with Phe in human MnSOD resulted in the decrease ink cat by an order of magnitude with no change ink cat/K m (8Guan Y. Hickey M.J. Borgstahl G.E.O. Hallewell R.A. Lepock J.R. O'Connor D. Hsieh Y. Nick H.S. Silverman D.N. Tainer J.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4722-4730Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Moreover, the side chain of Tyr34 forms a hydrogen bond with metal-bound azide, a substrate analog, in MnSOD from T. thermophilus(9Lah M.S. Dixon M.M. Pattridge K.A. Stallings W.C. Fee J.A. Ludwig M.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1646-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). There is an extensive hydrogen-bonded network in MnSOD that extends throughout the active-site cavity involving side-chain residues, the aqueous ligand of manganese, and other water molecules, part of which is shown in Fig. 1. This network has been identified by crystallography (8Guan Y. Hickey M.J. Borgstahl G.E.O. Hallewell R.A. Lepock J.R. O'Connor D. Hsieh Y. Nick H.S. Silverman D.N. Tainer J.A.

Duong D.K. Miller A.-F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8202-8208Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this network the solvent ligand of manganese is hydrogen-bonded to the side chain of Gln143, which in turn forms a hydrogen bond with the phenolic hydroxyl of Tyr34. The side-chain imidazole of His30 forms two hydrogen bonds in human MnSOD, one with the side-chain hydroxyl of Tyr34 through an intervening water molecule and a second with the side-chain hydroxyl of Tyr166 from the adjacent subunit in the dimer. This rather extensive hydrogen-bonded array could be involved in the proton transfer necessary to form product hydrogen peroxide by supporting a proton relay, or possibly some of these residues may be a source of the proton itself. Of course, the ultimate source of proton donation to product is from solution, and His30 and Tyr34in human MnSOD are partially exposed to solvent. Tyr166 is buried (data of Borgstahl et al. (10Borgstahl G.E.O. Parge H.E. Hickey M.J. Beyer W.F. Hallewell R.A. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 107-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar)). His30, Tyr34, and Tyr166 are conserved in all forms of MnSOD sequenced to date (11Jackson S.M.J. Cooper J.B. Biometals. 1998; 11: 159-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Initial studies of MnSOD from Bacillus stearothermophilusdetermined that its catalysis is complicated by the presence of an inactive form of the enzyme that can interconvert to an active form (12McAdam M.E. Fox R.A. Lavelle F. Fielden E.M. Biochem. J. 1977; 165: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Bull et al. (3Bull C. Niederhoffer E.C. Yoshida T. Fee J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4069-4076Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar) observed the inactive form spectrophotometrically in catalysis by T. thermophilus and suggested that it results from product inhibition, perhaps as an oxidative addition of O⨪2 to the Mn(II) form of the enzyme resulting in a side-on peroxo complex of Mn(III). Such an inhibited phase was also observed for human MnSOD (2Hsu J.-L. Hsieh Y. Tu C.K. O'Connor D. Nick H.S. Silverman D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17687-17691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The mutant of human MnSOD containing the replacement Tyr34 → Phe showed enhanced inhibition (8Guan Y. Hickey M.J. Borgstahl G.E.O. Hallewell R.A. Lepock J.R. O'Connor D. Hsieh Y. Nick H.S. Silverman D.N. Tainer J.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4722-4730Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To investigate further the structural and functional role of this hydrogen-bonded network in the active-site cavity of human MnSOD, we have prepared and measured catalysis by mutants at two additional sites in this network, His30 and Tyr166. The crystal structure for the mutant containing the replacement His30→ Asn showed that the hydrogen-bonded network was interrupted, and calorimetry showed that the main unfolding transition was decreased by 12 °C. The catalytic activities of these mutants showed that neither His30 nor Tyr166 is essential for the catalysis, but their replacement each caused substantial decreases in both k cat/K m andk cat, generally at least 10-fold. Sincek cat appears to have rate-contributing proton transfer steps, the decrease in k cat caused by the replacements suggests decreased proton transfer in the maximum velocity of catalysis. The replacements at positions 30 and 166 also caused a significant decrease in the extent of product inhibition compared with wild-type MnSOD. The oligonucleotides GCATATGAAGCACAGCCTCC and GGAGATCTCAGCATAACGATC were used as primers for PCR to amplify the human MnSOD cDNA (cDNA sequence reported by Beck et al. (13Beck Y. Oren R. Amit B. Levanon A. Gorecki M. Hartman A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 9076Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar)). The plasmid pHMNSOD4 (ATCC no. 59947), which contains human MnSOD, was subcloned into the TA cloning vector, pCRII (Invitrogen Corp.). A series of primers were designed to create the mutants H30X in human MnSOD (X = A, E, K, N, Q, or S). First, we designed a pair of oligonucleotides, primer 1 (5′-CGCTAGTAATCATTTCATGAAGCACAGCCTCCCCG-3′) and 2 (5′-CTGCAGAATACAGTAAGCTGC-3′), which, through PCR, would recreate the entire MnSOD coding region. Second, we prepared two oligonucleotides for each mutant to be made, designated as primer 3 (5′-CAGCTGCACCATTCGAAGCACCACGCGGCCTA-3′) and 4 (5′-TAGGCCGCGTGGTGCTTCGAATGGTGCAGCTG-3′), whose sequences are complementary to each other and contain the mutation of interest at position 30 (underlined) and a silent mutation to create a unique restriction site. Two separate PCR reactions were used to amplify the 5′ half (primers 1 and 4) and 3′ half (primers 3 and 2) of the MnSOD cDNA coding sequence. The PCR products from these two reactions were purified using electroelution and used as template DNA for the second round of PCR using primers 1 and 2. The H30X human MnSOD PCR products were cloned into the expression vector pTrc 99A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cloning was accomplished by using the restriction sites BspHI and PstI incorporated into primers 1 and 2, respectively. The BspHI site, which corresponds to the N-terminal portion of the protein, was annealed to the compatible cohesive ends of the NcoI site in pTrc 99A, recreating an ATG codon. The C-terminal end of the cDNA was cleaved and reannealed to pTrc 99A using PstI. The procedure for preparing Y166F human MnSOD was similar. Primers 3(5′-GGGAGCACGCGTACTTCCTTCAGTAT-3′) and 4(5′-ATAGTGAAGGAAGTACGCGTGCTCCC-3′) were synthesized; these sequences are complementary to each other and code for Phe at position 166 (underlined). These mutations were verified by DNA sequencing, along with the remainder of the coding sequence (both top and bottom strand). These constructs expressed human MnSOD as a mature protein in the mutantSodA−/SodB− E. coli (strain QC 774), and tagged with an extra methionine at the amino terminus. Culture conditions included 100 μm MnCl2. Yields of human MnSOD mutant protein were on average 70 mg of protein/50 g of bacterial pellet. Mutants of human MnSOD were purified fromE. coli using a combination of heat treatment (60 °C), dialysis, and ion exchange chromatography (DE52 and CM52) according to the procedures of Beck et al. (14Beck B.A. Bartfield D. Yavin Z. Levanon A. Gorecki M. Hartman J.R. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 930-935Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The purity of the resulting samples was determined on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, which showed a unique intense band. Each mutant was dialyzed thoroughly against EDTA and then analyzed for manganese content by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. These measurements were used to determine the concentration of active enzyme on a monomeric basis. In all of our calculations of purified enzyme, the concentration of enzyme is taken as the manganese concentration determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The fraction of active-sites occupied by manganese was determined to vary from 0.68 for H30N MnSOD to 0.79 for H30A. Protein concentrations were determined by the Lowry method. The mutant H30N crystallized from solutions consisting of 19.3 mg/ml protein buffered in 25 mmpotassium phosphate at pH 7.8 and 20% polyethylene glycol 2000 monomethyl ether. Rod-shaped crystals grown after 2 days belong to orthorhombic crystal form with unit cell dimensions ofa = 73.7 Å, b = 77.57 Å , andc = 135.46 Å. One flash-cooled H30N crystal was mounted under the liquid N2 stream and data collected at the Beamline 9-1 of the Stanford Synchrotron Research Laboratory using MAR345 area detector. The data were processed using DENZO (15Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar), and there were totally 35,154 unique reflections (99.9% complete) with aR sym of 6.4% to 2.3 Å resolution (36.4% for the last bin). The structure of H30N mutant was solved with AMoRe (16Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5029) Google Scholar) using one dimer of human MnSOD as a search probe. His30 in the native MnSOD structure was replaced with Asn using XFIT (17McRee D.E. J. Mol. Graph. 1992; 10: 44-47Crossref Google Scholar), and a tetrameric H30N mutant assembly was located in the asymmetric unit after rotation and translation search. A tetrameric H30N model in the asymmetric unit was then rigid body refined followed by geometry restrained positional and temperature factor refinement in XPLOR (18Brünger A.T. Kuriyan J. Karplus M. Science. 1987; 235: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar). The model was refit to ςA weighted 2Fo − Fc andFo − Fc maps using XFIT. The refinement was completed using bulk solvent correction in XPLOR with the manganese ion completely unrestrained during the final round of refinement to remove any force field bias. The final model consisting of four H30N subunits and 730 solvent molecules was refined to an R factor of 19.9% (R free 30%) from all data to 2.3 Å resolution. The average B factor for the whole protein (including water molecules) was 26 Å2. A Microcal-2 and a CSC Nano high sensitivity differential scanning calorimeter were used to obtain all denaturation profiles. Similar profiles were obtained from both calorimeters. Human MnSOD and mutant at 1.0 mg/ml in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) were deaerated under mild vacuum for 5 min and immediately scanned at a rate of temperature increase of 1 °C/min. The base line and change in specific heat (ΔCp) upon denaturation were corrected as described previously (19Borgstahl G.E.O. Parge H.E. Hickey M.J. Johnson M.J. Boissinot M. Hallewell R.A.

The peaks of the differential scanning calorimetry profile were deconvoluted assuming a reversible, non-two-state model (20Sturtevant J.M. Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 1987; 38: 463-488Crossref Google Scholar) using the software package ORIGIN (Microcal, Inc.). ΔH, ΔS, and Tm, defined as the temperature of half-completion, for each transition were obtained from the best fits. ΔΔG was calculated from these thermodynamic parameters setting ΔCp = 0 since the value of ΔCp for MnSOD is unknown. Assuming ΔCp = 0.12 cal/g/K gives ΔΔGvalues 10–40% lower (8Guan Y. Hickey M.J.

Experiments are based on the stabilization of KO2 in aprotic solvent and the subsequent large dilution of this solution by an aqueous solution of enzyme in a stopped-flow apparatus, as described by McClune and Fee (22McClune G.J. Fee J.A Biophys. J. 1978; 24: 65-69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). KO2 was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide with solubility of KO2 enhanced with 18-crown-6 ether (23Valentine J.S. Curtis A.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1975; 97: 224-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Kinetic Instruments, Ann Arbor, MI) was capable of efficient mixing of this solution with an aqueous solution of enzyme in buffer with a dead time between 1.5 and 2.0 ms. One drive syringe (capacity 50 μl) contained the aprotic solution of O⨪2; this was diluted 50-fold by the contents of a second syringe (capacity 2.5 ml), which contained enzyme, EDTA, and buffer. The decay of superoxide in initial velocity experiments and progress curves was monitored by its absorption at 250 nm (ε = 2000 m−1cm−1; Ref. 24Rabani J. Nielson S.O. J. Phys. Chem. 1969; 73: 3736-3744Crossref Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Stopped-flow experiments reported here were carried out at 20 °C. Four or more kinetic traces were averaged to reduce noise. Steady-state parameters were obtained by both least-squares analysis of such data (Enzfitter; Ref. 25Leatherbarrow R.J. Enzfitter. Elsevier BIOSOFT, Cambridge, United Kingdom1987Google Scholar) and analysis of progress curves (3Bull C. Niederhoffer E.C. Yoshida T. Fee J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4069-4076Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Unlike the native and other functional mutant structures of MnSOD, which crystallize in space group P21212 and have two MnSOD subunits in the asymmetric unit, H30N crystallized in space group P212121 and had four MnSOD subunits in the asymmetric unit. Like the wild-type human MnSOD which is tetrameric (2Hsu J.-L. Hsieh Y. Tu C.K. O'Connor D. Nick H.S. Silverman D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17687-17691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), the crystal structure of H30N is also tetrameric. The subunit fold and tetrameric assembly of the H30N mutant are very similar to the wild type with a root-mean-square deviation for Cα values of 0.56 Å. The superposition of the H30N tetramer and native tetramer shows a slight compression from the dimer interface region, and H30N has more compact tetrameric association than that in the wild type. The crystal structure of the mutant H30N MnSOD showed minimal changes in the orientation of residues in the active-site cavity, with Asn30 having the same dihedral angle about the Cα-Cβ bond as His30 in the wild-type enzyme (Fig.1). The primary structural changes in the H30N mutant involve altered local hydrogen bonds to solvent and side chains. In wild-type MnSOD, there is a water molecule that acts as a hydrogen-bonded bridge between the side chains of His30 and Tyr34 (Fig. 1). Such a water molecule between Tyr34 and Asn30 also exists in the H30N mutant; however, it has lost its hydrogen bonding to the side chain at residue 30. Therefore, the Mn-solvent-Gln143-Tyr34-H2O-His30-Tyr166hydrogen-bonded relay, which is present in the wild-type enzyme, is broken in the H30N mutant (Fig. 1). In addition, Tyr166from the adjacent subunit of the dimer, which in the wild type is hydrogen-bonded to the side chain of His30, is no longer hydrogen-bonded to Asn30 in the mutant due to the shorter length and orientation of the side chain of Asn30. In the wild type, the phenolic OH of Tyr166 forms a hydrogen bond to Nε2 of His30 with the Tyr OH-to-His Nε2 distance of 2.8 Å; in the H30N mutant, the distance is 3.8 Å between the phenolic OH of Tyr166 and the Oδ1 or Nδ2 of Asn30. There is also an extensive hydrogen bond relay through water molecules in the dimer interface that connects Gln143 of subunit A to Val160 of subunit B. The mutants H30N and H30Q, like the wild-type human MnSOD, absorb maximally near 480 nm. The extinction coefficient at 480 nm of wild-type human MnSOD in the pH range of 7.5 to 11.5 can be fit to a single ionization of pK a 9.4 with a maximum near 610m−1 cm−1 at low pH 2The extinction coefficient at 480 nm near 525 m−1 cm−1 reported by Hsuet al. (2Hsu J.-L. Hsieh Y. Tu C.K. O'Connor D. Nick H.S. Silverman D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17687-17691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) is not representative of the extinction coefficient of Mn(III)SOD. It represents a sample of mixed oxidation states Mn(III)SOD and Mn(II)SOD, the latter of which has a very weak absorption at 480 nm. The value of ε480 near 610 m−1cm−1 was determined for MnSOD in which the metal was fully oxidized (V. Leveque and C. K. Vance, unpublished results). ; this is similar to the value of pK a 9.3 obtained for the MnSOD fromE. coli (26Vance C.K. The Metal Ion Specificity of the Iron and Manganese Superoxide Dismutases Is Explained by Differences in the Redox Potentials and Proton Affinities between the Native and Metal Ion Substituted Enzymes from Escherichia coli. Ph.D dissertation. Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD1999Google Scholar). The maximal values of the extinction coefficients at 480 nm for H30N and H30Q in the same pH range are 610 and 630 m−1 cm−1. The variation with pH of the extinction coefficients for H30N and H30Q are also fit to an ionization with values 9.3 ± 0.1 and above 10.5, respectively, with maxima at low pH (Fig.2). These extinction coefficients have been calculated for complete occupancy of active-sites with manganese. Human Mn(II)SOD has a very small extinction coefficient at 480 nm (∼25 m−1 cm−1) compared with Mn(III)SOD. Wild-type human MnSOD is purified predominantly in the oxidized state, and these extinction coefficients suggest that the mutants H30N and H30Q are isolated also with manganese predominantly in the oxidized state. In support of this observation, we found that H30N and H30Q MnSOD did not have an EPR spectrum in the region containing the characteristic resonances of Mn(II)SOD; Mn(III)SOD is EPR-silent (27Fee J.A. Shapiro E.R. Moss T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6157-6159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Initial velocities of the decay of superoxide catalyzed by H30N MnSOD and measured by stopped-flow spectrophotometry could be fit to Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Typical rate data for H30N MnSOD are shown in Fig.3 in which the initial velocities of catalysis from the first 10% to 15% of the catalyzed decay of superoxide are plotted; the uncatalyzed dismutation rates have been subtracted. The maximal value ofk cat/K m for H30N MnSOD (pH 8 - 9) was near 2 × 108m−1s−1, about 5-fold less than that for the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 4). The pH dependence ofk cat/K m for superoxide decay catalyzed by H30N MnSOD can be roughly fit to a single ionization with an apparent pK a of 9.6 ± 0.1 (Fig. 4). This pK a value is nearly the same as that for wild-type MnSOD. The values of k cat/K mfor the replacements His30 → Ala, Ser, and Gln had no apparent pH dependence in the range of pH 8 to 10.5;k cat/K m for Tyr166 → Phe had no pH dependence from pH 8.0 to 9.6 and showed about a 50% decrease at pH 10.0. Values ofk cat/K m are given in TableI. For the replacements His30→ Glu and Lys, there was only very small catalytic activity (TableI).Figure 4The logarithm ofk cat/K m( m −1 s−1) for the catalyzed decay of superoxide catalyzed by wild-type human MnSOD (▪) and H30N MnSOD (●) measured by stopped-flow at 20 °C.

The values of k cat determined for the mutants H30N, H30Q, H30S, H30A, and Y166F were all independent of pH in the range of pH 8.0 to 10.5; their values are given in Table I. The values measured for k cat were decreased by approximately 10–40-fold compared with the value given in Table I ofk cat at 4 × 104s−1 for wild-type enzyme, a value that was obtained by a computer fit to pulse radiolysis data of a model for catalysis (2Hsu J.-L.

However, the maximal value of the superoxide concentration obtained in the pulse radiolysis studies was too low, 30 μm, to approach saturation, and the large extent of product inhibition precluded the use of stopped-flow techniques at larger substrate concentrations. We were able to establish firmly that at this concentration of superoxide (30 μm),k cat > 1 × 104s−1 for wild-type MnSOD. The replacement His30→ Glu had a value of k cat very small compared with wild type (Table I). However, the replacement His30→ Lys resulted in a value of k cat comparable to the most active of the mutants at position 30 (Table I). The solvent hydrogen isotope effects on the steady-state constants were determined for catalysis by H30N MnSOD in solutions containing 10 mm glycine buffer at pH 9.4 (uncorrected pH meter reading) and 20 °C. The ratio of k cat measured in H2O with that in D2O (0.98 atom fraction D) wasD k cat = 2.1 ± 0.1. The corresponding solvent hydrogen isotope effect onk cat/K m wasD k cat/K m = 1.2 ± 0.4. For Y166F MnSOD under these conditionsD k cat = 2.3 ± 0.1 andD k cat/K m = 1.6 ± 0.4. Another change caused by the replacement of His30 by Ala, Asn, and Gln and of Tyr166 by Phe is that the resulting mutants show less product inhibition in their catalysis of superoxide dismutation than does wild type. Product inhibition in MnSOD is characterized by a region of zero-order decay of superoxide (3Bull C. Niederhoffer E.C. Yoshida T. Fee J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4069-4076Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). For H30N the extent of product inhibition was about 4-fold less than with wild type. Product inhibition is prominent in both wild-type (2Hsu J.-L. Hsieh Y. Tu C.K. O'Connor D. Nick H.S. Silverman D.N. J. Biol.

On the basis of nitrate affinity and expression conditions, transporters have been classified into constitutive or inducible high affinity transporters (CHANT, IHANT), and constitutive or inducible low affinity nitrate transporters (CLANT, ILANT). Molecular cloning of nitrate transporters from fungi, algae, and plants allows to classify them into two families (NRT1 and NRT2), according to sequence similarities (1Crawford N.M. Glass A.D.M. Trends Plant Sci. 1998; 3: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (718) Google Scholar). NRT1 belongs to the peptide transporter superfamily, and members of this family transport either nitrate or histidine with comparable efficiency (8Zhou J.J. Teodoulou F.L. Muldin I. Ingemarsson B.

Nitrate assimilation is a highly regulated pathway in which nutritional and environmental conditions are determinant for metabolic adaptation. In this context, transporters should play an important role in regulating the amount of nitrate going into the cell according to its capability to assimilate or accumulate it. To know in a single organism each of the transporters, its specificity, and its regulation is a challenge to understand the nitrate assimilation pathway. In C. reinhardtii, two HANT have been identified. The bispecific HANT/HANiT, named system I and encoded by Nrt2;1and Nar2, and the specific HANT system II, encoded byNrt2;2 and Nar2. Both are two-component systems which require for functionality a NAR2 protein (19Galván A. Quesada A. Fernández E. J. Biol.

Since deletion mutants lacking system I and II are able to assimilate efficiently nitrite, it has been proposed thatNrt2;3 could be responsible for nitrite transport (15Quesada A. Hidalgo J. Fernández E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).

Cells were routinely grown at 25 °C under continuous light and 5% CO2-enriched (v/v) air in minimal HS medium containing 7.5 mm ammonium chloride (22Harris E. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook. Academic Press, New York1989Google Scholar). Cells were collected at mid-exponential phase of growth by centrifugation (4000 ×g, 5 min), washed twice with 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and then transferred to the indicated induction medium. Cultures were bubbled either with 5% CO2-enriched (v/v) air or with air washed through a saturated KOH solution. After the indicated times, cells were collected by centrifugation and processed immediately for enzyme assays, RNA extraction, or analytical determinations. Genetic crosses were carried out by the random spore plating method (23VanWinkle-Swift K.P. J. Phycol. 1977; 13: 225-231Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Segregants analyzed for their ability to grow on media containing ammonium, nitrate, or nitrite. For in vivo complementation analysis, the mating mixture of gametes was plated in selective media containing 4 mm nitrate (24Ebersold W.T. Science. 1967; 157: 447-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar,25Fernández E. Matagne R.F. Curr. Genet. 1986; 10: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Ammonium-grown cells or cells induced in different media were transferred to media containing 100 μm nitrite, at a cell concentration of 10–30 μg Chl/ml. Samples were taken at different times, and nitrite concentration in the media was measured. NiR activity was assayed as previously reported (26Galván A. Córdoba F. Cárdenas J. Fernández E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1074: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The assay mixture contained 300 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.4 mmKNO2, 0.8 mm methyl viologen, 16 mmdithionite, and toluene-permeabilized cells. Nitrite was determined according to Snell and Snell (27Snell F.D. Snell C.T. Colorimetric Methods of Analysis. 2. Van Nostrand, New York1949: 802-807Google Scholar), and chlorophyll as detailed by Arnon (28Arnon D.I. Plant Physiol. 1949; 24: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Isolation of genomic DNA and Southern transfer were performed as previously reported (29Ranum L.P.W. Thompson M.D. Schloss J.A. Lefebvre P.A. Silflow C.D. Genetics. 1988; 120: 109-122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Conditions for hybridization were carried out according to Schloss et al. (31Schloss J.A. Silflow C.D. Rosembaum J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 424-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and washes were performed at 65 °C, with 0.2× SSC and 0.2% SDS solution. Isolation of total RNA was carried out according to previously reported methods (31Schloss J.A. Silflow C.D. Rosembaum J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 424-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). RNA (20 μg) was fractionated on 1.6% agarose gels containing 17.5% formaldehyde (31Schloss J.A. Silflow C.D. Rosembaum J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 424-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and then transferred onto nylon membranes (Nytran-N2, Schleicher & Schuell) using 10× SSC buffer. Conditions for hybridization were previously reported (31Schloss J.A. Silflow C.D. Rosembaum J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 424-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and washing was performed at 65 °C, with 0.2× SSC and 0.2% SDS solution. Radioactive probes were labeled by the random primer method (32Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 266-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (5190) Google Scholar). Probes used were: probe 1, a 1.1-kb KpnI-SacI fragment corresponding to the 5′ region of the Nrt2;3 gene; probe 2, a XbaI-BamHI fragment corresponding to the 3′ region of the Nrt2;3 gene; and probe 3, aKpnI-EcoRI fragment that contains the 5′ region of Nrt2;3 gene in addition to the Nar5 gene (Ref.15Quesada A. Hidalgo J. Fernández E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar and Fig. 3 A). The C. reinhardtii strain D2 has a deletion at the Nia1 genome region includingNrt2;2, Nrt2;1, Nar2, Nia1, and Nar1 genes. This strain is not deficient at the NiR locus and assimilates nitrite efficiently (14Quesada A. Galván A. Schnell R. Lefevre P.A. Fernández E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 240: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Thus, this strain is useful for the study of potential nitrite transporters without the background of system I (Nrt2;1, Nar2) and system II (Nrt2;2, Nar2), previously identified (14Quesada A. Galván A. Schnell R. Lefevre P.A. Fernández E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 240: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar,19Galván A. Quesada A. Fernández E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2088-2092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the strain D2 grown in ammonium and transferred to nitrite medium was not able to take up nitrite under a 5% (v/v) CO2 atmosphere, unless nitrate as a signal was present in the medium (Fig. 1 A). The nitrate signal was sensed above 10 μm, so that at 50 μm nitrate induction of the nitrite transport activity was optimal. Since strain D2 cannot reduce nitrate to nitrite nor transport it efficiently under these conditions (14Quesada A. Galván A. Schnell R. Lefevre P.A. Fernández E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 240: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the observed effect was considered as a nitrate signaling of nitrite transport activity induction. As shown in Fig. 1 B, in the absence of CO2, strain D2 induced a nitrite transport activity without the requirement of nitrate signaling. These results seem to suggest, among other hypotheses, that there exist two different nitrite transporters, which are expressed differentially depending on the nitrate and carbon conditions. In order to verify this hypothesis, a further characterization was performed. These transport activities will be referred hereafter as system III, for the nitrate-signaled activity under high CO2, and system IV, for the nitrate-independent activity induced under CO2 deficiency. The system III operated preferentially at pH 6 versus pH 8; meanwhile, system IV worked slightly better at pH 8 versuspH 6 under CO2 deficiency (data not shown). These transport activities were not the result of nitrite diffusion coupled to a sink effect of the NiR enzyme. First, the nitrate signal was always needed for optimal expression of system III, even at pH 6 (data not shown). Second, NiR activity determined in cells induced under different nitrogen and carbon conditions was not the counterpart of the corresponding nitrite transport activity (Fig.2). For example, in a medium containing 0.1 mm nitrite and bubbled with CO2, NiR activity was almost twice the activity observed without CO2, although nitrite was not consumed in the former condition. The differential characteristics for these nitrite transport activities are summarized in Table I. System III transport activity was blocked by 1 mm ammonium, added as a sulfate or chloride form. This regulation by ammonium is a general characteristic of the nitrate/nitrite transporters identified until now in C. reinhardtii. So, when cells are consuming either nitrate or nitrite, addition of ammonium immediately blocks their transport activities (19Galván A. Quesada A. Fernández E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2088-2092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 26Galván A. Córdoba F. Cárdenas J. Fernández E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1074: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 34Florencio F.J. Vega J.M. Planta. 1983; 158: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, 1 mm ammonium did not affect the system IV activity when added as sulfate and had a slight inhibitory effect when added as chloride. This inhibition was due to chloride, since at 10 mm amounts of either NaCl or KCl, inhibition of system IV activity was much stronger. In addition, the chloride channel inhibitor 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid (NPPB) (35Cho M.H. Spalding E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8134-8138Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) inhibited system IV transport activity. In contrast, system III was slightly affected by chloride or NPPB. Systems III and IV were also regulated by CO2 in a different way. System III transport activity was partially inhibited when CO2 was removed from the medium. In contrast, system IV transport activity was blocked when cells were bubbled with 5% CO2.Table IEffect of CO2, ammonium, chloride, and the chloride channel inhibitor NPPB on the nitrite transport activity by systems III and IVSystem IIISystem IVConditionNiT activityConditionNiT activity%%+ CO2100 ± 20− CO2100 ± 21+ CO2 + 1 mm NH4Cl3.0 ± 1.1− CO2 + 1 mmNH4Cl73.0 ± 2.8+ CO2+ 0.5 mm (NH4)2SO41.6 ± 1.6− CO2 + 0.5 mm(NH4)2SO493.0 ± 5.4+ CO2 + 10 mm NaCl85.0 ± 0.2− CO2 + 10 mm NaCl29.3 ± 1.5+ CO2 + 10 mm KCl89.1 ± 1.0− CO2 + 10 mm KCl27.5 ± 2.6+ CO2 + 100 μm NPPB88.4 ± 1.3− CO2 + 100 μm NPPB52.8 ± 4.1− CO249.0 ± 4.6+ CO20The nitrite transport activity of systems III and IV were induced for 3 h in nitrate media and high CO2 and in nitrite media without CO2, respectively.

Open table in a new tab The nitrite transport activity of systems III and IV were induced for 3 h in nitrate media and high CO2 and in nitrite media without CO2, respectively. Then, the nitrite transport activity was determined as indicated under “Experimental Procedures” by transfer of cells to fresh media containing 100 μmNaNO2 and the indicated compounds in the presence (+) or absence (−) of CO2. 100% activity corresponded to 16.6 ± 3.3 and 5.2 ± 1.1 μmol NO2−/h mg Chl for systems III and IV, respectively. Kinetic parameters were determined for both systems from the progress curves as previously reported (19Galván A. Quesada A. Fernández E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2088-2092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 33Córdoba F. Cárdenas J. Fernández E. Plant Physiol. 1986; 82: 904-908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). System III had aK s for nitrite of 5 ± 2 μmand a V max of 19 ± 4 μmol nitrite/h mg Chl. System IV had a K s for nitrite of 33 ± 6 μm and V max of 10 ± 3 μmol nitrite/h mg Chl. The K s for system III fits with that previously reported in C. reinhardtii(19Galván A. Quesada A. Fernández E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2088-2092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was performed to study expression of theNrt2;3 gene in strain D2. Total RNA was isolated from cells subject to different nitrogen and CO2 conditions. AKpnI-SacI 1-kb fragment corresponding to the 5′region of Nrt2;3 gene was used as a probe (probe 1, Fig.3 A). Interestingly, this probe recognized two transcripts of 2.8 and 2.4 kb, respectively, which were differentially expressed in strain D2 (Fig. 3 B). This result suggests that in addition to the Nrt2;3 transcripts (15Quesada A. Hidalgo J. Fernández E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), another gene sharing significant homology with the used probe was detected. The expression pattern of both transcripts was different. At high CO2 both transcripts were repressed in ammonium and optimally expressed when 100 μm nitrate was present in the medium. However, when CO2 was limiting the transcript of 2.8 kb was expressed under either nitrogen source, i.e.ammonium, nitrate, nitrite, or without nitrogen, although optimally in nitrite (Fig. 3 B). When a XbaI-BamHI 4-kb fragment corresponding to the 3′ region of Nrt2;3 gene was used as a probe (probe 2, Fig.3 C), the 2.4-kb transcript was mostly observed and their expression pattern fits with that obtained with the probe 1. That the 2.4-kb transcript was optimally expressed at high CO2, required a nitrate signal, and was almost absent in nitrite medium without CO2 suggests a relationship between this transcript and system III transport activity. That the 2.8-kb transcript (namedNrt2;4) was optimally expressed under limiting CO2 in a nitrate signaling-independent manner suggests that it could correspond to that of system IV. Southern blot analyses were performed. DNA from strain D2 was digested with SacI, SmaI, and BamHI, and probed with the 5′ region of Nrt2;3 KpnI-SacI fragment (Fig. 4). The most intense bands corresponded to the expected sizes for the Nrt2;3 gene region (15Quesada A. Hidalgo J. Fernández E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Additional faint bands were found in digestions with the enzymes used, under high stringency conditions. The existence of these additional hybridization bands is in agreement with the presence of an Nrt2;3 analogue gene in strain D2. Under high CO2 and 0.1 mm nitrite, both transcripts were expressed (Fig. 3 B, lane 4), NiR activity was high (Fig. 2), but no nitrite transport activity was detected (Fig. 1 A). This seems to indicate that nitrate and/or CO2 also have a regulatory role on the transporters at the post-transcriptional level. To gain more information, cells induced in the above medium during 5 h were processed in two ways. (a) Cells were kept with high CO2, and 0.1 mm nitrate, or nitrate plus cycloheximide were added to the medium (Fig.5 A). Then, nitrite transport activity was observed only when cycloheximide was not present, and with a kinetics much faster than in an induction from ammonium-grown cells. (b) Cells were bubbled with air lacking CO2 in the presence or absence of cycloheximide, without nitrate signaling (Fig. 5 B). Then, after CO2 removal, only cells without cycloheximide showed nitrite transport activity. Again, this transport activity was significantly faster than in an induction from ammonium-grown cells. These results indicate that protein synthesis is required for expression of system III and IV transport activity in response to signaling by nitrate and absence of CO2, respectively. InC. reinhardtii, nitrate/nitrite transporters have been shown to be responsible for chlorate toxicity. Although NR has a role in mediating chlorate toxicity, the absence/presence of NR activity is not critical for chlorate resistance/toxicity (2Fernández E. Galván A. Quesada A. Rochaix J.D. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Merchant S. Molecular Biology of Chlamydomonas: Chloroplast and Mitochondria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, The Netherlands1998: 637-659Google Scholar, 36Prieto R. Fernández E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 237: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Strain D2 is a chlorate-resistant mutant that lacks both HANT systems (I and II) and NR (14Quesada A. Galván A. Schnell R. Lefevre P.A. Fernández E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 240: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). When a functional NR is present in a D2 background, the resulting strain is also chlorate resistant (data not shown). Since strain D2 contains other nitrite transporters, i.e.systems III and IV shown above, it could be possible to isolate nitrite transport mutants from this strain by selecting for chlorate-resistant colonies. However, strain D2 was resistant to 2 mm chlorate in medium containing a neutral nitrogen source such as urea. Notwithstanding, when 1 mm nitrate was present in the medium, strain D2 became sensitive to chlorate and spontaneous resistant colonies appeared in this medium at a ratio of about 1 × 10−6. Twenty-two chlorate-resistant mutants were analyzed, and all were defective in activities and/or kinetic parameters of nitrite transport. Only one was stable, and its phenotype was consistent with that of a nitrite transport mutant. This strain named DC2-III had the following characteristics. (i) It did not grow in nitrite medium despite having NiR activity (data not shown). (ii) It lacked nitrite transport activity at high CO2 (system III) (Fig. 6 A). (iii) Under limiting CO2 conditions, DC2-III strain induced a nitrite transport activity (Fig. 6 B) that was presumably due to system IV, since it was inhibited by chloride, strongly by CO2, but not significantly by ammonium (Fig.6 C). Mutant DC2-III seems to be affected in a gene(s) involved in expression of nitrite transport system III. Nit2from C. reinhardtii is the only positive regulatory gene identified in photosynthetic eukaryotes (25Fernández E. Matagne R.F. Curr. Genet. 1986; 10: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 37Schnell R.A. Lefebvre P.A. Genetics. 1993; 134: 737-747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nit2mutants have a Nit− phenotype and do not express NR or NiR (37Schnell R.A. Lefebvre P.A. Genetics. 1993; 134: 737-747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Fernández E. Schnell R. Ranum L.P.W.

Plant Physiol. 1992; 98: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The Nrt2;3 gene is clustered with another nitrate regulated gene Nar5 whose function and relationship with nitrate assimilation are to be solved out. Nar5 expression does not seem to be under the control of Nit2 (15Quesada A. Hidalgo J. Fernández E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Nar5 and Nrt2;3-related genes were analyzed for expression in the strain DC2-III. Total RNA was isolated from ammonium-grown or nitrate-induced cells for 3 h, under high CO2 conditions. A KpnI-EcoRI fragment, which contains fragments of Nrt2;3 andNar5 genes (Fig. 3 A; Ref. 15Quesada A. Hidalgo J. Fernández E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), was used as a probe. Results shown in Fig. 7 indicate that: (i) in contrast to the parental strain D2, both the 2.8-kb and 2.4-kb transcripts were almost undetectable in the strain DC2-III; and (ii) Nar5 expression was significantly decreased in DC2-III strain, when compared with that in the parental strain D2. Since phenotype of mutant DC2-III was similar to that ofNit2 mutants, genetic analysis by in vivocomplementation and genetic crosses was performed between these two strains. Diploid strains 203 (Nit2−) X DC2-III were able to grow in nitrate- or nitrite-containing media. In addition, the genetic cross between strain 203 (Nit2 −) and mutant DC2-III was analyzed from the growth of segregants in ammonium, and nitrate- or nitrite-containing media. The frequency of Nit+/Nit− and Niit+/Niit− segregants was 1:100, and 4:100, respectively. These results indicate that DC2-III was not defective at the Nit2 gene but in a locus that is closely linked toNit2. In this work, the existence of two HANiT systems (III and IV), in addition to the previously reported bispecific HANT/HANiT system I and specific HANT system II (19Galván A. Quesada A. Fernández E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2088-2092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), is demonstrated in C. reinhardtii. Physiological and molecular characterization of strain D2, which is deleted in the Nrt2;1 andNrt2;2 genes encoding transport systems I and II (14Quesada A. Galván A. Schnell R. Lefevre P.A. Fernández E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 240: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), together with the isolation and characterization of the nitrite transport mutant DC2-III, allow us to assign particular characteristics to the two nitrite transport systems. Systems III and IV were regulated differentially by nitrogen and carbon signaling. Expression of system III transport activity depends on a nitrate signal. This transporter operates at high CO2, and its activity is blocked by ammonium. In contrast, expression of system IV transport activity occurs at limiting CO2 independently of signaling by nitrate. System IV activity is not inhibited by ammonium, but it is blocked by CO2, and strongly inhibited by chloride, or the chloride channel inhibitor NPPB. Two transcripts of 2.4 and 2.8 kb were detected from strain D2 in Northern blots at high stringency, and by using Nrt2;3 probes. The 2.4-kb transcript corresponded to the Nrt2;3 gene, whose previously reported transcript size (15Quesada A. Hidalgo J. Fernández E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) has been reevaluated with probes corresponding to either 5′ or 3′ regions of the gene. The 2.8-kb transcript was mostly detected with a probe from the 5′ region ofNrt2;3. Sequence analysis of 5′ region shows thatNrt2;3 is a member of the Nrt2 gene family (15Quesada A. Hidalgo J. Fernández E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), so the 2.8-kb transcript could correspond to a fourth gene of this family in C. reinhardtii, named Nrt2;4. The existence of a Nrt2;4 gene was also supported by the Southern blot data. Systems III and IV could be related with Nrt2;3 andNrt2;4 genes, respectively, since their corresponding transport activities show a similar expression pattern to each of these transcripts. The expression of the 2.4-kb/Nrt2;3 transcript was clearly dependent on the micromolar nitrate signal, meanwhile the expression of the 2.8-kb/Nrt2;4 transcript occurs when CO2 was limiting, even in the presence of ammonium. In addition, in nitrite-containing medium at limiting CO2, where system IV activity is operative, the only transcript hybridizing to the Nrt2;3 probe was Nrt2;4. The C. reinhardtii systems III and IV are HANiT withK s in the micromolar range. The characterization of C. reinhardtii NiR mutants has shown that there exist a LANT activity with a K s for nitrate in the millimolar range which appears to correspond to system III. 2M. T. Navarro, E. Guerra, E. Fernández, and A. Galván, manuscript in preparation. In addition, system IV in these NiR mutants shows a HANT activity with aK s for nitrate in the micromolar range.2 No HANiT has been reported in higher plants until now. However, in C. reinhardtii, it can be summarized that the nitrate and nitrite transport systems correspond to the bispecific HANT/HANiT systems I and IV; and the specific HANT system II, and HANiT system III (Ref. 19Galván A. Quesada A. Fernández E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2088-2092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar and this work). Systems I and II are essential inC. reinhardtii to support cell growth in nitrate-containing media (19Galván A. Quesada A. Fernández E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2088-2092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 21Quesada A. Galván A. Fernández E. Plant J. 1994; 5: 407-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). C. reinhardtii strains lacking systems I and II but having system III and IV are unable to grow in nitrate media, even though nitrate at low concentrations could be transported by system IV or at higher concentrations by system III (Refs. 14Quesada A. Galván A. Schnell R. Lefevre P.A. Fernández E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 240: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar and 19Galván A. Quesada A. Fernández E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2088-2092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholarand this work). Thus, the precise function of these systems III and IV in nitrate assimilation, other than transporting nitrite, remains to be solved. However, a regulatory role in controlling intracellular nitrate concentrations, according to nutritional and environmental conditions, could be suggested. The nitrite transporter mutant DC2-III seems to be deficient in a locus, closely linked to Nit2, and involved in the nitrate signaling required for expression of system III/Nrt2;3. The selection strategy used to obtain this type of mutant is in agreement with this assumption. Parental strain D2 is chlorate-resistant in a neutral medium such as urea, since systems I and II are lacking (14Quesada A. Galván A. Schnell R. Lefevre P.A. Fernández E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 240: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and systems III and IV are not operative under the high CO2conditions used for cell growth and selection. System IV is blocked by CO2, and system III requires a nitrate signal for optimal expression. Thus, by providing a nitrate signal, the NR-deficient D2 strain became sensitive to chlorate, which indicates that chlorate entry by system III was responsible for cell toxicity. The phenotype of mutant strain DC2-III, i.e. the absence of system III transport activity, the undetectable Nrt2;3 gene expression, and the significant decrease in the nitrate-dependentNar5 gene expression, suggests that this strain is defective in nitrate signaling. Several hypotheses could explain these results. Mutant DC2-III could be defective in a regulatory gene mediating nitrate signaling by two different routes: one dependent onNit2, which would switch on expression of nitrate assimilation genes (2Fernández E. Galván A. Quesada A. Rochaix J.D. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Merchant S. Molecular Biology of Chlamydomonas: Chloroplast and Mitochondria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, The Netherlands1998: 637-659Google Scholar, 37Schnell R.A. Lefebvre P.A. Genetics. 1993; 134: 737-747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and another independent of Nit2, which would switch on Nar5 gene expression (15Quesada A. Hidalgo J. Fernández E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the mutation could have affected the Nrt2;3gene itself and thus the activity of system III, which would be responsible for nitrate signaling. In this context, it has been observed that the presence or absence of specific transporters inC. reinhardtii give different nitrate/nitrite signaling effects. 3J. Rexach, B. Montero, E. Fernández, and A. Galván, unpublished observation. Interestingly, genetic data showed that mutant DC2-III is defective in a locus closely linked to Nit2. Clustering of nitrate assimilation genes is appearing as a common feature in C. reinhardtii and might represent a strategy for efficiency in regulatory common mechanisms under very changeable environmental conditions.

This E2F site becomes strongly occupied 18 h after serum stimulation, implying that an E2F activator complex plays a role in activation of the <i>PCNA</i> gene at the onset of S phase. We detected a 500–600-base pair-long antisense transcript by Northern blot analysis. This RNA has no apparent coding capacity and is constitutively transcribed from a promoter located within the first intron. We suggest that silencing of the <i>PCNA</i> gene is accomplished through base pairing between sense pre-mRNA and antisense RNA. The binding of S phase-specific E2F complexes at the +583 element may help to overcome the negative effect of the antisense transcript, which results in up-regulation of <i>PCNA</i> expression in proliferating cells."
https://openalex.org/W2090443934,"Calcium stone crystal attachment to the urinary epithelium plays an essential role in the development of kidney stones by allowing small crystals to be retained in the kidney until they become macroscopic. We among others have described attachment of stone crystals to cultured renal epithelia (Wiessner, J. H., Kleinman, J. G., Blumenthal, S. S., Garancis, J. C., and Mandel, G. S. (1987) J. Urol. 138, 640–643). To isolate protein(s) that may participate in crystal attachment, apical membranes of cultured renal inner medullary collecting duct were biotinylated, the cells were lysed with detergent, the lysate was subjected to hydroxyapatite chromatography, and fractions were incubated with calcium oxalate monohydrate. Electrophoresis of material solubilized from the crystals showed several selectively adsorbed protein bands. A 110-kDa band stained positively for biotin and for glycosides and bound45Ca. The amino acid sequence of this band was determined to be that of a protein closely related to rat nucleolin (nucleolin-related protein; NRP). NRP was cloned and sequenced and was 83% homologous with the previously sequenced nucleolar protein nucleolin. Using temperature-induced phase partitioning with Triton X-114, NRP was associated with both the insoluble membrane skeleton pellet and the soluble aqueous phase but not the soluble detergent phase. This association with the membrane skeleton was increased in the presence of calcium. Thus, NRP is associated with the apical membranes of cultured renal tubular cells and is bound to membrane skeletal elements in a calcium-dependent fashion. The physiological role of NRP remains to be determined; however, a pathophysiological role may be that of mediating the attachment to the renal tubular epithelium of calcium stone crystals. Calcium stone crystal attachment to the urinary epithelium plays an essential role in the development of kidney stones by allowing small crystals to be retained in the kidney until they become macroscopic.

It is unlikely that single crystals could grow fast enough or produce large enough aggregates as they traverse the nephron to become lodged in the terminal collecting ducts on the basis of size alone (2Finlayson B. Reid F. Invest. Urol. 1978; 15: 442-448PubMed Google Scholar, 3Sohnel O. Grases F. Garcia-Ferragut L. Scanning Microsc. 1994; 8: 513-522PubMed Google Scholar). We have demonstrated attachment of stone crystals to renal epithelia in vitro, including COM,1 the most common stone constituent, as well as calcium oxalate dihydrate and hydroxyapatite (HA) (1Wiessner J.H. Kleinman J.G. Blumenthal S.S. Garancis J.C. Mandel G.S. J. Urol. 1987; 138: 640-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We have proposed that apical membrane glycoproteins in renal tubules may play a role in attachment of calcium oxalate and calcium phosphates to the epithelium, thereby providing a mechanism for retention. In the present study, we analyzed surface proteins from rat inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) cells for their ability to bind ionic calcium, calcium oxalate crystals, and HA with high affinity. We describe a novel cell surface glycoprotein, NRP, closely related to nucleolin and propose that this protein plays an important role in crystal attachment in kidney stone disease. Nucleolin, the major nucleolar phosphoprotein, has a molecular mass of about 110 kDa and is considered to be a transcriptional factor for preribosomal RNA synthesis. Initially, it was localized to a dense region of the nucleolus, but later it was also found in cytoplasm. Nucleolin or a protein closely related to it has been demonstrated in association with the plasma membranes of some cells, where it functions as a receptor for lipoproteins, viruses, extracellular matrix, growth factors, and other molecules (4Semenkovich C.F.

In the present study, we examine the influence of calcium on the distribution of NRP. IMCD cell cultures originally obtained from Dr. John Schwartz (Boston University Medical School) were cultured as described previously (10Selvaggio A.M. Schwartz J.H. Bengele H.H. Gordon F.D. Alexander E.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: F391-F400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These are continuously passaged cells from enzymatically disaggregated papillas of Harlan Sprague Dawley rats. Cultures from up to the 12th passage were used in the present work. Cells were cultured in serum-free Ham's F-12 and Delbecco's medium with 1% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5 μg/ml transferrin, 5 μg/ml insulin, 0.018 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 0.0017 μg/ml selenium, 30 μg/ml penicillin G, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. NRP was detected by Western blot analysis using a polyclonal anti-nucleolin antiserum produced against purified nucleolin extracted from 3T3-F442A cells and kindly supplied by Dr. Raymond Petryshyn (Children's Medical Center, Washington, D. C.) (11Warrener P. Petryshyn R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 716-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Antibody against Grb2 was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Nitrocellulose membranes to which proteins to be tested for calcium binding properties were transferred were soaked for 1 h in a solution containing 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm imidazole-HCl at pH 6.8, with several changes of solution. This was followed by a 10-min incubation in the same solution containing 1 mCi/liter 45Ca. After incubation, membranes were washed with H2O to remove excess 45Ca. Protein bands that bound 45Ca were detected by autoradiography. IMCD cells growing on 100-mm diameter plastic plates were rinsed in PBS with 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2and were cooled for 10 min in a refrigerator. Then they were incubated with 0.5 mg/ml NHS-SS-biotin or sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce), 3 ml/plate, for 1 h at 4 °C with constant agitation. To remove unreacted biotin, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1m glycine. Cells were then lysed in a 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, buffer containing 150 mm NaCl; 1.5 mm MgCl2; 1 mm EGTA; 10% glycerol; 1% Triton X-100; the protease inhibitors leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin (all at 10 μg/ml); and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 μg/ml). This mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 15 min and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was collected and further purified as indicated below. Cultured IMCD cells were scraped from plates, pelleted by centrifugation, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then resuspended in 50 mmHEPES buffer at pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EGTA, 9 g/liter sucrose, and the above mentioned protease inhibitors. Homogenization was done using a Dounce tissue grinder so as to preserve intact nuclei. The suspension was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected and then subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min in a 50.2Ti rotor (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA). The resulting pellet was solubilized in SDS-sample buffer or washed with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitors. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer, as described above. The lysate was centrifuged at 1000 ×g for 5 min, the supernatant discarded, and the pellet was washed several times with same buffer. The washed pellet was suspended in a nucleolar extraction buffer using 10–15 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. The buffer contained protease inhibitors as described previously, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm NaN3, and 10 mm HEPES at pH 7.4 (as described in Ref. 13Dignam J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 194-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar with modifications). Then particulate material was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE. Washed membranes were resuspended and incubated on ice for 5 min in 0.15 m NaCl containing 1% Triton X-114 and 10 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.4. The solubilized membranes were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min and centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 3 min. The detergent phase was extracted three additional times with 10 volumes of the same buffer, containing 0.06% Triton X-114 and precipitated with 20 volumes of acetone at −20 °C. The aqueous phase was extracted three more times with Triton X-114 to a concentration of 2%. The insoluble pellet, representing the membrane skeleton fraction, was boiled with sample buffer, containing β-mercaptoethanol. Total carbohydrate labeling was done using a commercial protocol for nitrocellulose membrane labeling (ECL glycoprotein detection system; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Biotin and anti-nucleolin antibodies were also detected with enhanced chemiluminescence using streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase and secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies, respectively. Solutions of 10 mm CaCl2 and 10 mmNa2C2O4 were mixed together at a rate of approximately 1 ml/min with constant stirring. The calcium oxalate crystals that precipitated were washed several times with H2O followed by methanol and dried at 95 °C for 1 h in an oven. Cells were lysed as described under “Surface Biotinylation of Membrane Proteins,” and the buffer was exchanged for PB at pH 7.2 using a PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The proteins were separated by liquid chromatography using a Bio-Scale CHT-I HA column (Bio-Rad). The column was loaded with the clarified lysate and then washed with PB, pH 6.8, until base-line OD was reached. The bound proteins were eluted with 5 column volumes of PB at pH 6.8, using a linear gradient from 10 to 500 mm. The eluate was collected in 0.5-ml fractions; fractions 26–30 were pooled, exchanged into an AU (15Burns J.R. Finlayson B. Invest. Urol. 1980; 18: 167-169PubMed Google Scholar) and incubated overnight with 10 mg of COM crystals in presence of protease inhibitors. The crystals with the adsorbed proteins were washed five times with AU buffer and solubilized in 0.5 m EDTA. This solution was extensively dialyzed against water and lyophilized. The resulting proteins were electrophoresed on 5–15% gradient polyacrylamide gel, electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and stained with Amido Black staining solution (Sigma). Peptide purification for microsequencing was done according to a published protocol (16LeGendre N. Mansfield M. Weiss A. Matsudaira P. Matsudaira P.T. A Practical Guide to Protein and Peptide Purification for Microsequencing. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1993: 71-101Crossref Google Scholar). Amino terminus microsequencing was performed at the Medical College of Wisconsin Protein/Nucleic Acid Shared Facility using a Beckman proton sequencer, model LF 3000. Total RNA was prepared from IMCD cells or Harlan Sprague Dawley rat renal papillas using TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies), and mRNA was further purified with the Poly(A)Tract mRNA Isolation System (Promega, Madison, WI). The First-strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to generate cDNA for amplification by polymerase chain reaction. cDNA was made using a universal hexameric primer or with the T18 primer supplied with the kit. Polymerase chain reaction was carried out using Advantage polymerase (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and the oligonucleotide primers NH2-(5′-ATGGTGAARCTCGCAAAGGCHG), based on the amino acid sequence of the isolated NRP and NH2-(5′-CAAAACCCACGGAGAGTC), based on the published sequence for rat nucleolin. The downstream primer for both amplifications was COOH-(5′-TTATTCAAACTTCGTCTTCT), derived from the amino acid sequence for nucleolin. Following amplifications, the 2.1-kilobase pair DNA fragments were purified on glass beads by Sephaglas BandPrep kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and ligated into pCR 2.1 vector (Invitrogene, Carlsbad, CA). Three clones, obtained from independent cDNA-synthesis reactions using each pair of primers were sequenced (Retrogene, San Diego, CA), and consensus sequences were derived using the Wisconsin Package Version 9.1 software (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). To verify the presence of an NRP transcript in rat papilla, cDNA from this tissue was amplified using the primers NH2-(5′-ACCTGGCAAGAAGGGAACCA) and COOH-(5′-CAGGAGCAGATTTGCTGAAG), and a product was cloned into pCR 2.1 vector and then sequenced. To screen for possible attachment factors for COM crystals on the surface of collecting duct epithelium, a method based on selective precipitation of these proteins with crystals was developed. The scheme is based on the assumption that candidate proteins would carry a net negative charge and most likely would bind ionic Ca. Calcium overlay assay of proteins from 100,000 × g pellet fraction of cultured renal IMCD cells, a fraction consisting of plasma membrane as well as intracellular membranes (17Thomas T.C. McNamee M.G. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 499-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), revealed a prominent protein of about 110 kDa and several other bands that bound calcium more weakly. The proteins on the surface of IMCD cells were biotinylated with water-soluble NHS-SS-biotin, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and blotted to membranes. The blots were probed for biotin with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase and for calcium binding with45Ca. A band at approximately 110 kDa was both biotinylated and bound calcium (Fig. 1). The cultured cells were also subjected to mild lysis with 1% Triton X-100, followed by buffer exchange into PB and liquid chromatography using a HA column. Proteins were eluted with a 10–500 mmPB gradient. A 110-kDa protein with strong ability to bind calcium was found in several fractions with high affinity to HA (Fig.2). Fractions containing 110 kDa were pooled together and incubated with COM crystals in an AU previously used to study crystal attachment to intact cells (15Burns J.R. Finlayson B. Invest. Urol. 1980; 18: 167-169PubMed Google Scholar, 18Riese R.J. Riese J.W. Kleinman J.G. Wiessner J.H. Mandel G.S. Mandel N.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: F1025-F1032PubMed Google Scholar). After centrifugation, crystals were extensively washed with the AU and dissolved in 0.5 m EDTA together with the proteins that were adsorbed to them. The absorbed proteins were resolved using 5–15% SDS-PAGE and stained with Amido Black stain (Fig. 3). The two bands of 110 and 26 kDa were microsequenced. The 110-kDa protein showed considerable homology to published sequences for nucleolin and will be referred to hereafter as NRP (Fig. 4). The 26-kDa band appears to be identical to amphoterin. Further characterization of the amphoterin isolated in this manner was not performed. Glycoprotein detection system reveals the presence of carbohydrate on NRP (Fig. 2). We examined whether NRP would also react with anti-nucleolin polyclonal antibody produced against purified nucleolin. These antibodies yielded an excellent signal with NRP (Fig. 2).Figure 4N-terminal sequence of the 110-kDa band.Proteins adsorbed to COM were separated using SDS-PAGE, electroblotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and microsequenced. The N-terminal sequence of the first 20 amino acids is shown together with published sequences for nucleolin isolated from rat and other species.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To verify the surface localization of NRP, surface proteins of cultured IMCD were labeled with sulfo-NHS-biotin and precipitated from column fractions with COM crystals as described above. Western blotting shows that NRP has been completely precipitated as well as the corresponding biotinylated band (Fig. 5 A). The specificity of surface biotinylation using this protocol is demonstrated by the failure to biotinylate Grb2, a cytosolic protein that associates with growth factor-related tyrosine kinase receptors (Fig. 5 B), and is supported by data reported by others (19Altin J.G. Pagler E.B. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To determine whether surface-associated NRP is the same or different from the nucleolar shuttle protein of these cells, low speed Triton X-100-insoluble pellet consisting predominantly of whole nuclei was washed several times, extracted, and precipitated with COM crystals. The crystal-associated proteins were solubilized and subjected to PAGE, and a 110-kDa band was sequenced. The first 20 amino acids were identical to these founded in surface-associated NRP. mRNA was prepared from IMCD cells and used as a template for first strand cDNA synthesis. The integrity of the mRNA was checked by Northern hybridization using a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe. cDNA was reverse transcribed from this mRNA using either universal hexameric primer or with T18 primer supplied with the kit. The NRP cDNA was amplified with an N-terminal oligonucleotide primer derived from amino acid sequence of the isolated NRP with the addition of an initial methionine and the C-terminal primer 5′-TTATTCAAACTTCGTCTTCT. This latter, antisense primer was constructed based on the observation that all known nucleolins from different species have identical sequences at their 3′-end. Following amplification, the 2.1-kilobase pair DNA fragment was purified and cloned into pCR 2.1 cloning vector (Invitrogene). Three clones obtained from independent cDNA-synthesis reactions were sequenced, and the consensus sequence is presented here (Fig. 6). An identical product was amplified and cloned from RNA extracted from papillas of Harlan Sprague Dawley rats (from which the IMCD cells were derived) using NRP-specific primers. To investigate further the nature of association of NRP with plasma membrane, we performed experiments with Triton X-114 temperature-induced phase partitioning. This technique can be applied for separation of integral and peripheral membrane proteins (14Brusca J.S. Radolf J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 228: 182-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Because of the calcium-binding property of NRP, the effect of calcium on NRP membrane attachment was investigated. A microsome pellet was prepared as described earlier, resuspended in TBS with 0 or 5 mm CaCl2, and subjected to fractionation with Triton X-114. Three fractions were obtained: a Triton X-114-insoluble pellet, comprising membrane skeletal elements, a detergent fraction containing solubilized integral membrane proteins, and an aqueous phase with peripheral membrane (also referred to as membrane-associated) proteins partitioned therein. No NRP was detected in the detergent phase; most was found in the aqueous phase, with a significant portion also associated with the membrane skeleton. The amount of insoluble pellet-bound NRP was several times higher in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2 (Fig.7). A similar observation was made with membrane extraction experiments; 100,000 × g microsome pellet, containing elements of the membrane skeleton together with integral and peripheral membrane proteins, was incubated with TBS buffer alone or in TBS containing 5 mm CaCl2 or 50 mm EDTA. In the presence of CaCl2, all NRP was found to be associated with membranes; without calcium, most of the NRP was washed out with TBS (Fig.8).Figure 8Effect of calcium concentration on membrane retention of NRP . A microsome preparation was incubated in TBS with (+) or without (−) 5 mm Ca2+, with (+) or without (−) 50 mm EDTA, or neither. After high speed centrifugation, the supernatant (S) and membrane pellet (P) was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose, and Western analysis was performed with a polyclonal anti-nucleolin antiserum.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Crystal attachment to renal tubule cells is thought to be a critical step in kidney stone formation, but the molecules mediating this interaction have not been previously defined. In their observations in BSC-1 cells, Lieske and Toback (20Lieske J.C. Toback F.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: F800-F807PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested that the attachment site for crystals endocytosed by these cells contains an RGD recognition site and are, thus, integrins or similar molecules. This same group has reported a decline of 80% in crystal adhesion to BSC-1 cells after neuraminidase treatment and a concentration-dependent inhibition of crystal attachment by sialic acid-binding lectin from T. vulgaris (21Lieske J.C. Leonard R. Toback F.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F604-F612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data are consistent with their additional observations that coating COM crystals with polyanions or coating of the cells with polycations inhibited crystal attachment to the BSC-1 cells (21Lieske J.C. Leonard R. Toback F.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F604-F612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Lieske J.C. Leonard R. Swift H. Toback F.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270 (abstr.): F192-F199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that much if not all of the attachment of COM to these cells may be mediated by negative surface charges on apical cell membranes. Several molecules with anionic components are present on the tubule cell membrane surface. Experiments have been performed to examine lipid perturbations of the apical membranes of cultured IMCD cells in an attempt to determine whether these components of the membrane are responsible for crystal adherence (23Bigelow M.W. Wiessner J.H. Kleinman J.G. Mandel N.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F55-F62PubMed Google Scholar). The results suggest that phosphatidylserine can mediate COM attachment. Membrane glycoproteins also contribute a large number of anionic sites, including backbone sites of sulfation, phosphorylation, or acidic residues, as well as glycosidic side chain sialic acids. In this study, an avid, relatively specific interaction of membrane glycoproteins and calcium-containing crystals was utilized to select for molecules that may be involved in renal retention of the crystals that comprise kidney stones. Using this strategy, we isolated and identified a glycoprotein related to nucleolin, which we have designated NRP, some of whose properties we have examined. The amino acid sequences of NRP and rat nucleolin previously cloned (GenBankTM accession numbers M55015, M55017, M55020, andM55022) exhibit 83% homology (24Bourbon H.M. Amalric F. Gene ( Amst. ). 1990; 88: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This comparison is shown in Fig. 6. Computer analysis of the derived amino acid sequence for NRP shows that it retains three putative RNA-binding regions of rat nucleolin, but potential glycosylation sites are different; NRP has an extra glycosylation site at position 10 and lacks one at position 404. The relative positions of three other proposed glycosylation sites were not changed (320, 483, and 497 for NRP and 321, 481, and 495 for nucleolin). Since we could sequence the first 20 amino acids of NRP without being blocked, it is unlikely that protein is glycosylated at the N terminus. The nuclear localization signal shows differences in two amino acid residues, both occurring at positions that can tolerate point mutations, and some insertions (25Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar). Nucleolin is multiply phosphorylated and has been shown to be a substrate for casein kinase II (26Caizergues-Ferrer M. Belenguer P. Lapeyre B. Amalric F. Wallace M.O. Olson M.O. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7876-7883Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). NRP has 25 potential casein kinase II phosphorylation sites, and rat nucleolin has 22. The extra phosphorylation sites of NRP occur in positions 235, 391, 450, and 457, and one in position 10 is missing. Primer specific only for previously cloned rat nucleolin amplified a product identical to nucleolin from RNA extracted from Harlan Sprague Dawley rat papillas, while the primers specific for NRP also yielded NRP fragments from this source. This suggests that NRP is a new member of the nucleolin family of proteins. There is some evidence for the existence of different nucleolin-related proteins. A membrane-associated form of human nucleolin can be distinguished from the nuclear form by immunoprecipitation with chicken nucleolin-specific antiserum (7de Verdugo U.R. Selinka H.C. Huber M. Kramer B. Kellermann J.H. Kandolf R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6751-6757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but these authors did not find any difference in amino acid sequences of tryptic peptides derived from the purified 100-kDa protein. Amino acid sequencing of a fructosyllysine-specific binding protein from monocyte cell membranes showed the absence of an initial methionine in comparison with the nucleolin sequence (6Krantz S. Salazar R. Brandt R. Kellermann J. Lottspeich F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1266: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The most striking feature of NRP isolated in the current study is long stretches of aspartic and glutamic acid residues, which form two major negatively charged regions of the protein. The calcium-binding properties of NRP can probably be explained by electrostatic interaction of negatively charged surfaces formed by clusters of acidic amino acids and calcium ions that provide areas of partial positive surface charge on the {101̄} face of CaOx crystals (27Habeger C.F. Linhart R.V. Adair J.H. Adair J.H. Science, Technology, and Application of Colloidal Suspensions. American Ceramic Society, Westerville, OH1995: 111-120Google Scholar). There are other examples of calcium-binding proteins in eukaryotes that contain acidic amino acid domains (28Scott B.T. Simmerman H.K. Collins J.H. Nadal-Ginard B. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8958-8964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Nishimune Y. Celio M.R. Pauls T.L. Schwaller B. Guidebook to the Calcium-binding Proteins.

Oxford University Press, London1996: 216-220Google Scholar). These are generally thought to be involved in calcium storage. Acidic clusters could account for the high capacity and low affinity calcium binding, a common characteristic of all these proteins. Neither NRP nor the proteins mentioned above contain an EF-hand calcium-binding motif. Nucleolin also has a conserved domain structure and contains large acidic clusters toward its N terminus. NRP interacts in a calcium-dependent manner with components of the membrane skeleton, which may facilitate a calcium-dependent recruitment of NRP to the cell surface. Stabilization of membrane skeleton can be affected by changes of intracellular ion concentration and by removal of the extracellular Ca2+. There are several other examples of calcium-dependent protein-membrane interactions among calcium-binding proteins. Annexin II has an ability to interact in a calcium-dependent fashion with plasma membranes and/or cytoskeletal elements (31Gerke V. Weber K. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with the calcium ionophore A23187 has been reported to result in relocation of cytosolic pools of annexins IV and V to the plasma membrane (32Barwise J.L. Walker J.H. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 247-255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A rise in the level of intracellular Ca2+ leads to the translocation of MRP8 and MRP14, belonging to the S100 protein family, to the plasma membrane and intermediate filaments (33Roth J. Burwinkel F. van den Bos C. Goebeler M. Vollmer E. Sorg C. Blood. 1993; 82: 1875-1883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction of neuronal calcium-binding protein VILIP 1 with the cytoskeleton through actin may cause calcium-dependent recruitment of this protein to the cell membrane (34Lenz S.E. Braunewell K.H. Weise C. Nedlina-Chittka A. Gundelfinger E.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 1078-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Finally, sorcin also has been shown to undergo a calcium-dependent translocation process from the cytosol to cellular membranes (35Meyers M.B. Zamparelli C. Verzili D. Dicker A.P. Blanck Chiancone T.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The physiologic function of NRP on the cellular membrane remains unclear. Nucleolin itself has been shown to be a nuclear-cytoplasm shuttle protein, probably involved in the transport of ribosomal RNA (36Borer R.A. Lehner C.F. Eppenberger H.M. Nigg E.A.

However, nucleolin or a protein closely related to it has also been demonstrated in association with the plasma membrane, where it subserves various receptor-like functions (4Semenkovich C.F.

Based on intensity of NRP band in calcium overlay assay in cell lysates and the extremely high percentage of glutamic and aspartic acid residues, we can suggest that NRP has high capacity for calcium and, by analogy with calsequestrin and calreticulin, low affinity for this ion. These features may enable NRP to function as calcium storage protein in endoplasmic reticulum of IMCD cells. Such function would correspond to its abundance in the microsomal cell fraction. The calcium-dependent membrane translocation of NRP would bring it into proximity to EF-hand proteins and annexins, which can act as calcium sensors, transducing the information into changes in specific cellular processes (38Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Heldin D.-H. Purton M. Signal Transduction. Chapman & Hall, London1998: 205-222Google Scholar). NRP is selectively adsorbed to HA and COM crystals. Both of these substances are major constituents of human kidney stones, found in 29 and 52% of stones, respectively (39Mandel N.S. Mandel G.S. J. Urol. 1989; 142: 1516-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The affinity of NRP for HA and COM crystals suggests a role for this membrane-associated protein in the pathophysiology of the most common forms of kidney stone disease through facilitating the attachment of individual crystals or small aggregates of crystals to the apical membrane of the IMCD. This attachment would allow for the retention of crystalline material that would not otherwise be large enough to be retained in the kidney, allowing such material to serve as a nidus for the development of clinical stones. In summary, the electrophoretic position of a major band after surface biotinylation of IMCD cells corresponds to the position of NRP. We were also able to selectively precipitate this major biotinylated band with COM crystals. Taken together, these observations lead to conclusion that significant amount of NRP can be found on surface of IMCD cells. The role of NRP on the membrane remains to be determined, but we propose that NRP may mediate attachment of calcium-containing stone crystals to the apical membrane of IMCD cells."

However, the cellular site of action has not been clearly defined as it has long been recognized that group IIA PLA2 is both a secretory and mitochondrial protein. The purpose of this study was to determine the subcellular target of the group IIA PLA2 and its role in apoptosis stimulated by growth factor withdrawal. Cloning of the rat liver group IIA PLA2 demonstrated a typical secretory signal and no alternative splicing of the primary transcript. When a sequence including the signal peptide and first 8 residues in the mature enzyme or the entire PLA2 (including the signal peptide) was fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein, the fusion protein was directed to the secretory pathway rather than mitochondria in baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells. To examine the role of group IIA PLA2 in cell injury, wild type (wt) rat group IIA PLA2 and a mutant group IIA PLA2 containing a His-47 → Gln mutation (at the catalytic center) were transfected into BHK cells and cells stably expressing these constructs were isolated. After deprivation of growth factors, both normal BHK cells and BHK cells expressing mutant PLA2 underwent massive apoptosis, while BHK cells expressing wt PLA2 showed considerable resistance to growth factor withdrawal-induced apoptosis. The secretory PLA2 inhibitors 12-epi-scalaradial and aristolochic acid abrogated resistance to apoptosis in the wt PLA2 expressing cells. These two inhibitors did not induce cell death in the presence of fetal bovine serum, suggesting that they induce cell death by blocking PLA2 generated survival signals. This study demonstrates that group IIA PLA2generates anti-apoptotic survival signals in BHK cells targeting the secretory pathway, and suggests that high levels of group IIA PLA2 accumulated at inflammatory sites may not only regulate inflammation, but also may protect cells from unnecessary death induced by pro-inflammatory agents.

Commun. 1992; 183: 719-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of this mitochondrial group IIA PLA2 reveals the protein to be nearly identical to the mature secretory enzyme (15Van Schaik R.H.H. Verhoeven N.M. Neijs F.W. Aarsman A.J. van den Bosch H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1169: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), indicating that the pre-protein of mitochondrial group IIA PLA2 is likely processed at the exactly the same site as the secretory group IIA PLA2. As discussed in a recent review, mitochondria are thought to be a target of group IIA PLA2 (2Tischield J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17247-17250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Using PLA2 inhibitors and antisense oligonucleotides specific for group IIA PLA2, we found that group IIA PLA2 contributed to cell injury during chemical hypoxia in isolated rat hepatocytes (16Harrison D.C. Lemasters J.J. Herman B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 17Wang H. Harrison-Shostak D.C. Lemasters J.J. Herman B. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1318-1325Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial injury is a critical step in cell death during chemical hypoxia (18Pastorino J.G. Snyder J.W. Serroni A. Hoek J.B. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13791-13798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Data from our laboratory as well as others have demonstrated that products of PLA2 catalyzed reactions can induce the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), and reagents known to inhibit PLA2 activity can block induction of the MPT in isolated mitochondria (19Broekemeier K.M. Pfeiffer D.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16440-16449Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 20Nieminen A.-L. Saylor A.K. Tesfai S.A. Herman B. Lemasters J.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Thus, the mitochondria appear to be a logical target of group IIA PLA2 where it could induce the MPT and onset of cell death. The recent discovery of other low molecular PLA2s (i.e. group V PLA2) has drawn into question some of the functions previously attributed to group IIA PLA2(2Tischield J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17247-17250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). For example, late phase release of AA during mast cell activation was believed to be mediated by group IIA PLA2, but has recently been found to be normal in a cell line lacking demonstrable group IIA PLA2 activity (21Reddy S.T. Winstead M.V. Tischield J.A. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13591-13596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Certain reagents used to modulate group IIA PLA2 activity such as inhibitors, antisense oligonucleotides, and antibodies thought to be specific to group IIA PLA2, have now been shown to act nonspecifically via group V PLA2. Given these concerns, the most direct way of elucidating group IIA PLA2 function is to study cellular phenotype changes after expression of group IIA PLA2 and its mutants. In this study, we generated cells stably expressing rat group IIA PLA2 and its His-47 (a residue essential for its catalytic activity) to Gln mutant (22Yu L. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9325-9329Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We found that the group IIA PLA2 generated anti-apoptotic survival signals in BHK cells. This finding sheds new light on the understanding of the function of group IIA PLA2 in inflammation and other pathological processes. Enhanced GFP (EGFP) fusion vector pEGFP-N1, expression vector pIRES1neo, Quick Clone rat liver cDNA, and ApoAlert DNA Fragmentation Assay Kit were purchased fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolab (Beverly, MA). T4 DNA ligase and CELLTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay were from Promega (Madison, WI). The Expand High Fidelity PCR System and Apoptotic DNA Ladder Kit were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN). QIAprep Miniprep, QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit, and SuperFect Transfection Reagent were purchased from QIAGEN (Santa Clarita, CA). BODIPY TR ceramide and MitoTracker Red CM-H2Xros were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). 12-epi-Scaradial, aristolochic acid, and lysophosphatidic acid were purchased from BIOMOL (Plymouth Meeting, PA). The PCR amplification program used was as follows: 94 °C 5 min, 50 °C 2 min, 72 °C, 3 min (first cycle); 94 °C 1 min, 50 °C 2 min, 72 °C, 3 min (30 cycles), 94 °C 1 min, 50 °C, 2 min, 72 °C 10 min (last cycle). To clone the sequence encoding the mature rat liver group IIA PLA2protein, PCR reaction was performed using upstream primer F3B, 5′-AATTCAGCTCGAGATGAGCCTTCTGGAGTTTGGGCAAATG-3′ and downstream primer R1B, 5′-CGAAGATGCTGCAGTAAGCAACTGGGCGTCTTCCCTTTGCAAAACTTGTTGGGGTAGAAC-3′ and rat liver cDNA as template. The fragment was cut withXhoI/PstI and inserted into pEGFP-N1. The resulting plasmid was named pF3B. To clone the complete cDNA sequence of the rat group IIA PLA2, PCR reaction was performed using upstream primer F5, 5′-GAGAGCGGCCGCATGAAGGTCCTCCTGTTGCTAGCAGT-3′ and downstream primer R1D, 5′-GATGTCGAATTCAGCAACTGGGCGTCTTCCCTTTGC-3′ and rat liver cDNA as template. The PCR fragment was digested withNotI/EcoRI and inserted into pIRES1neo, resulting in pPLA2. To create an in-frame fusion between the full-length PLA2 and EGFP, PCR reaction was performed using upstream primer F4B 5′-AATTCAGCTCGAGATGAGCCTTCTGGAGTTTGGGCAAATG-3′ and downstream primer R1B and rat liver cDNA as template. The PCR fragment was digested with PstI/XhoI, then cloned intoPstI/XhoI sites upstream of the N terminus of EGFP in pEGFP-N1. The resulting plasmid was named pF4B. The PLA2-EGFP coding region was removed by digestion withNdeI (a site in the CMV promoter upstream of the PLA2-EGFP region) and NotI, and was cloned into pIRES1neo, resulting in pFPG. To construct MHIS that carries a His-47 → Gln mutation in PLA2 (22Yu L. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9325-9329Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we used the upstream primer MHISF 5′-CAGAGGATCCCCCAAGGATGCCACAGATTGGTGCTGTGTGACTCAAGACTGTTGTTAC-3′, which overlaps the single BamHI site in the PLA2 and carried a CAT (His) to CAA (Gln), and the downstream primer MHISR 5′-ATGGTGGCGACCGGTGGATCCCGGGCCCGC-3′ and pF4B as template in the PCR reaction. The fragment carrying the Gln mutation was digested with BamHI and recovered from agarose gel. The His-47 in pF4B was then replaced with Gln using the following procedure: pF4B was digested with BamHI to remove the fragment carrying His-47. The remaining vector sequence (including part of the PLA2 sequence) was then ligated to the fragment carrying the mutation at 16 °C for 1 h. PCR was then performed using F4B and R1B as primers with the ligation reaction as template. The fragment corresponding to the correct size was recovered from the agarose gel, digested with XhoI/PstI, and cloned into pEGFP-N1. The resulting plasmid was named pMHIS. To clone the signal peptide sequence, PCR was performed using primer SIGF 5′-GTGTATCATATGCCAAGTACG-3′ and primer SIGR 5′-CAGAATCTGCAGCCCAAACTCCAGAAGGCTCCCCTGGACCTGAATTGAG-3′ and pFPG as template. The fragment was recovered and digested withNdeI/PstI, then cloned into the corresponding sites in pF4B, resulting in in-frame fusion with EGFP coding region. The resulting plasmid was named pSIG/G. To generate the group IIA PLA2 mutants carrying a His-47 → Gln mutation, PCR was performed using F5 and R1D primers and pMIHS template. The fragment was cloned as described for pPLA2. In all the fusion proteins, the stop codon of PLA2 (TGA) was changed to TTA which encodes a Leu residue. The sequences of all PCR-derived constructs were confirmed. Baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaitherburg, MD) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma). In some experiments, DMEM/F-12 (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used. For transient expression, cells were grown on coverslips in a 35-mm culture dish to about 50% confluence. In a typical transfection experiment, 2 μg of DNA was mixed with 100 μl of medium (FBS- and antibiotic-free) and 25 μl of SuperFect Transfection Reagent (QIAGEN) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. 1 ml of medium containing 10% FBS was added and the mixture immediately added to the cells. Following incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, then cultured in fresh medium. EGFP fluorescence usually could be observed after overnight incubation. To obtain stable clones, Geneticin (500 μg/ml, Life Technologies, Inc.) was added to medium 2–3 days post-transfection. The cells were selected for 2 weeks. RNA was isolated from cells using High Pure RNA Isolation Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's manual. RT-PCR was performed using Access RT-PCR System (Promega). A 50-μl reaction contained 25 μl of nuclease-free water, 10 μl of avian myeloblastosis virus/Tf1 5 × buffer, 1 μl of 10 mmdNTP mixture, 5 μl of F5 primer (4 μm), 5 μl of R1D primer (4 μm), 2 μl of 25 mmMgSO4, 1 μl of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (5 units/μl), 1 μl of Tf1 DNA polymerase (5 units/μl), and 2 μl of RNA. Reverse transcription was carried out at 48 °C for 1 h. After incubation at 95 °C for 4 min to inactivate reverse transcriptase, PCR amplification was performed using 95 °C 1 min, 60 °C 1 min, 70 °C 1 min for 30 cycles. The DNA was separated on 1% agarose gel. Final concentrations of the probes were 10 nm for MitoTracker and 15 μm for BODIPY TR ceramide. To stain organelles, cells were cultured in medium containing the appropriate probes for 10–30 min, then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. The coverslips were then mounted on slides and sealed with rubber cement. Fluorescence was examined with Olympus IX-70 microscope and recorded with an ORCA100 CCD camera (Hamamatsu). The filter settings for EGFP fluorescence were a 488/20 nm excitation band-pass filter, a 495-nm dichroic mirror, and a 513/30 nm emission filter. The filter settings for red fluorescence (MitoTracker, BODIPY TR ceramide) were a 530–550 nm excitation band-pass filter, a 570-nm dichroic mirror, and a 590-nm (long pass) emission filter. Cell viability was determined with CELLTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega) according the manufacture's instruction. DNA ladders were detected either with Apoptotic DNA Ladder kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or with partial lysis of plasma membrane with 0.5% Triton X-100 with some modification (23Fimia G.M. Gottifredi V. Passananti C. Maione R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15575-15579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and preparing low molecular DNA. TUNEL assay was performed using ApoAlert DNA fragmentation Assay Kit (CLONTECH). The full-length sequence (including signal peptide) of secretory group IIA PLA2 from rat platelets (secretory/membrane-associated) is available in GenBank (accession number D00523). Rat liver group IIA PLA2 has been reported to be localized in mitochondria (12Aarsman A.J. de Jong J.G. Arnoldussen E. Neys F.W. van Wassenaar P.D. van den Bosch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10008-10014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the sequence of the mature liver/mitochondrial group IIA PLA2 is also available in GenBank (accession number X74364). The sequence of these two proteins (rat platelet secretory group IIA PLA2 versusrat liver group IIA PLA2) differs by only 1 amino acid residue, i.e. Arg-94 in the liver/mitochondrial group IIA PLA2 versus Ala-94 in the secretory group IIA PLA2 (15Van Schaik R.H.H. Verhoeven N.M. Neijs F.W. Aarsman A.J. van den Bosch H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1169: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 24Ishizaki J. Ohara O. Nakamura E. Tamaki M. Ono T.

Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1087: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Because the presequence of the mitochondrial group IIA PLA2has not been identified, it is unclear whether these two proteins contain the same signal peptide, and whether group IIA PLA2can localize to both mitochondria and secretory pathways. Based on the N- and C-terminal sequence of the liver/mitochondrial group IIA PLA2, we cloned the cDNA sequence encoding mature PLA2 from rat liver by PCR amplification. The sequence we cloned was identical to that of the secretory group IIA PLA2 including an Ala at position 94. It is likely that the inaccuracy of earlier versions of Taq polymerase caused the previously reported difference in the sequence of mitochindrialversus secretory PLA2. Using primers corresponding to the signal peptide sequence of the secretory PLA2 and the COOH terminus of mitochondrial/secretory group IIA PLA2, we amplified the full-length cDNA sequence of the group IIA PLA2 from rat liver. The sequence, including signal peptide, was again identical to that of the rat secretory group IIA PLA2. We then examined whether there were any alternatively spliced forms of group IIA PLA2 that may bear different presequence/or signal peptide. Using primers corresponding to the 5′ terminus of the primary transcript (PSTART in Fig.1 A) (26Ohara O. Ishizaki J. Nakano T. Arita H. Teraoka H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6697-7002Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and to the C terminus of mitochondrial/secretory group IIA PLA2 (R1B) to amplify any possible alternatively spliced mRNAs, only one band was detected in the reaction product (Fig. 1 B). To examine whether this band contained more than one DNA fragment, the band was recovered and subjected to direct sequencing using PSTART and R1B as primers. No heterogeneity was found (Fig. 1 C). Therefore, we conclude that there is only one group IIA PLA2 molecule in rat liver. The data also indicate that before post-translational processing, mitochondrial group IIA PLA2 bears the same signal peptide as the secretory group IIA PLA2 does. To examine whether rat liver group IIA PLA2 targets to mitochondria, we fused the N-terminal 29 residues (including the 21-residue signal peptide and 8 residues of the mature enzyme) to the N terminus of EGFP (SIG/G in Fig. 2). When expressed in BHK cells, the SIG/G fusion protein localized mainly at one pole of the nucleus (Fig.3 B), which is characteristic for the Golgi body. In contrast, when expressed alone EGFP was evenly distributed in the cytosol (Fig. 3 A). In some cells, fusion proteins were also found in typical secretory organelles, including Golgi stacks (Fig. 3 C), vesicles detaching from Golgi body (Fig. 3 D), endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 3 E), and vesicles (Fig. 3 F). This reflects the different stages of secretory protein undergoing the maturation-secretion process.Figure 3SIG/G fluorescence. A, cells transfected with pEGFP-N1 (control). B-F, cells transfected with pSIG/G. A was taken with × 10 objective lens;B with × 20; C-F with × 100.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also generated fusion proteins composed of the full-length rat group IIA PLA2 (including signal peptide) and EGFP (FPG or MHIS in Fig. 2). MHIS is identical to FPG except it contains a His-47 → Gln mutation. When expressed in BHK cells, these fusion proteins also displayed a distribution pattern typical for a secretory protein. Fig.4, A and B (FPG) and C (MHIS), show the fusion protein localized mainly in vesicles. Fig. 4, D-F (FPG), show the localization of FPG fusion protein in the Golgi body. Fig. 4, G-I (FPG), demonstrate that the fusion protein does not localize in mitochondria. From these results, it is concluded that the rat liver group IIA PLA2 is a secretory protein. Therefore, during cell injury, group IIA PLA2 cannot directly regulate mitochondrial function and induce the MPT. Thus, all of the physiological effects elicited by rat liver group IIA PLA2 should be considered as the result of its interaction on the membranes of the secretory pathways, and in particular, the plasma membrane. To study the biological function of the secretory group IIA PLA2, we generated cells stably expressing this gene. For this purpose, we used a bicistronic expression system (pIRES1neo, CLONTECH). In this system, a single cytomegalovirus promoter directs the transcription of mRNA consisting of both the group IIA PLA2 and the selection marker neor. The group IIA PLA2 is located upstream of neor in the bicistronic transcript. Because the two genes are simultaneously expressed, after transfection and selection nearly all the G418-resistant cells express the group IIA PLA2. This allowed us to rapidly obtain a pool of PLA2 expressing cells without cloning. A total of 35 G418-resistant clones were obtained. After harvesting and pooling of these cells (NP), the expression of rat group IIA PLA2 was confirmed (Fig. 5 A). To our surprise, stable expression of group IIA PLA2 was not associated with cytotoxicity. In fact, when cultured in serum-free medium, normal BHK cells underwent massive apoptosis, while apoptosis in the NP cells was significantly lower (Fig. 5 B). To examine whether resistance to apoptosis of the NP cells was due to expression of the rat group IIA PLA2, we generated a mutant PLA2, in which His-47, the residue essential for the hydrolytic activity (by binding of an H2O molecule to the catalytic center) of PLA2, was mutated to Gln (Fig. 2) (22Yu L. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9325-9329Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A pool of cells (HQ) expressing the His-47 mutant was obtained using the same method as described for the NP cells, and the expression of the mutant PLA2 was confirmed (Fig. 5 A). As shown in Fig. 5, C and D, the HQ cells underwent massive apoptosis after withdrawal of FBS. We then compared the viability of BHK, HQ, and NP cells in medium lacking growth factors. Fig. 6,A-C, show NP cells survived better than BHK and HQ cells in serum-free medium. Morphological changes observed in serum-free medium is also more substantial for normal BHK and HQ cells compared with NP cells (Fig. 6 D). If resistance to apoptosis of NP cells is caused by rat group IIA PLA2 expression, then secretory PLA2 inhibitors should be able to abrogate this effect. 12-epi-Scalaradial (SCA) is a specific inhibitor for secretory PLA2 (27Thommesen L. Sjursen W. Gasvik K. Hanssen W. Brekke O.L. Skattebol L. Holmeide A.K. Espevik T. Johansen B. Laegreid A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3421-3430PubMed Google Scholar, 28Paya M. Terencio M.C. Ferrandiz M.L.

Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 1661-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A dose-dependent inhibition of cell survival in serum-free medium was found in NP cells in the presence of SCA (Fig.7 A). SCA also inhibited the survival of BHK and HQ cells. A possible explanation is that it might abrogate the endogenous sPLA2 function. Another widely used PLA2 inhibitor, aristolochic acid (ArA) (30Martinez-Salgado C. Rodriguez-Barbero A. Rodriguez-Puyol D. Perez de Lema G. Lopez-Novoa J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F60-F66PubMed Google Scholar, 31Glaser K.B. Sung M.L. Hartman D.A. Lock Y.W. Bauer J. Walter T. Carlson R.P.

Pharmacol. 1994; 251: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), also abrogated the survival effect in NP cells (Fig. 7 B). In the presence of FBS, these inhibitors did not have significant effects on cell survival (Fig. 7, C and D). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that expression of rat group IIA PLA2 produces survival signals in this model system. Group IIA PLA2 is also known to generate lipid mediators including AA and LPA (5Fourcade O. Simon M.F. Viode C. Rugani N. Leballe F. Ragab A. Fournie B. Sarda L. Chap H. Cell. 1995; 80: 919-927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). To study whether they might mediate group IIA PLA2 survival activity in the NP cells, we treated the NP cells with LPA and AA. At high concentration (30 μm), AA itself induced cell death. At lower concentration, AA did not have apparent protective effects (data not shown). Similarly, LPA did not have any protective effect in either BHK or HQ cells, but it did increase cell survival of NP cells (Fig. 7 E). Therefore, neither AA nor LPA can replace the signals elicited by rat group IIA PLA2. The major goal of our study was to elucidate the role of rat liver group IIA PLA2 in apoptosis induced by serum starvation. It is known that increased group IIA PLA2 expression is associated with hypoxia/reperfusion injury in rat hepatocytes (16Harrison D.C. Lemasters J.J. Herman B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 17Wang H. Harrison-Shostak D.C. Lemasters J.J. Herman B. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1318-1325Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and that the products of PLA2-catalyzed reactions can induce the MPT in isolated mitochondria. In addition, a number of papers have proposed that mitochondrial PLA2 might induce the MPT following a variety of insults (33Broekemeier K.M. Pfeiffer D.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 34Broekemeier K.M. Schmid P.C. Schmid H.H. Pfeiffer D.R . J. Biol.

Chem. 1979; 254: 11485-11494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data, in conjunction with the report detailing the biochemical purification of mitochondrial localized group IIA PLA2 from rat liver 10 years ago (12Aarsman A.J. de Jong J.G. Arnoldussen E. Neys F.W. van Wassenaar P.D. van den Bosch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10008-10014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), support the hypothesis that group IIA PLA2is part of the injury pathway in cells and exerts this injury promoting activity by targeting the mitochondria. However, it has generally been accepted that mammalian group IIA PLA2 can be both a secretory and mitochondrial protein (2Tischield J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17247-17250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 3Van den Bosch H. Aarsman A.J. van Schaik R.H. Schalkwijk C.G. Neijs F.W. Sturk A. Biochem. Soc.

Louisot P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 719-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and to date, most work aimed at elucidating the activity of group IIA PLA2have focussed on secretory group IIA PLA2. Because of this, we decided to visualize the location of this PLA2 in normal and stressed cells using an EGFP-PLA2 fusion protein to determine whether mitochondria are a target of group IIA PLA2. We cloned group IIA PLA2 from rat liver (reportedly localized in mitochondria (12Aarsman A.J. de Jong J.G. Arnoldussen E. Neys F.W. van Wassenaar P.D. van den Bosch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10008-10014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), and the sequence we cloned was identical to secretory group IIA PLA2. Furthermore, we did not find any alternatively spliced variants of the primary transcript of group IIA PLA2 that might generate a different signal peptide. These results indicate that there is only one type of group IIA PLA2 molecule in rat liver. We then studied the subcellular localization of the rat group IIA PLA2. To accomplish this, we used EGFP as a tag to follow the maturation and intracellular location of the fusion protein in living cells. This method has been demonstrated to work for both secretory and mitochondrial proteins (36Kaether C. Gerdes H.H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 37Kaether C. Glombik S.T. Almers W. Gerdes H.H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 74: 133-142PubMed Google Scholar, 38Yano M.

To our surprise, EGFP fusion protein consisting of either the signal peptide or full-length sequence of group IIA PLA2 was found exclusively localized to the secretory pathways, but never in mitochondria. This distribution pattern is not cell-type (BHK) specific, as similar results were obtained in the mouse hepatocyte cell line AML12 (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that group IIA PLA2 is not a mitochondrially localized protein. It is therefore unlikely that group IIA PLA2 has any direct role in regulating mitochondrial function and onset of the MPT. Secretory group IIA PLA2 is believed to regulate a number of physiological as well as pathological processes by generating AA and other lipid mediators. High levels of group IIA PLA2 have been found at inflammatory sites and increased serum group IIA PLA2 levels are thought to be related to the severity of sepsis (39Tong L.J. Dong L.W. Hsu H.K. Liu M.S. J. Surg. Res. 1998; 75: 165-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 40Nyman K.M. Uhl W. Forsstrom J. Buchler M. Beger H.G. Nevalainen T.J. J. Surg. Res. 1996; 60: 7-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 41Guidet B. Piot O. Masliah J. Barakett V. Maury E. Bereziat G. Offenstadt G. Infection. 1996; 24: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In isolated hepatocytes, expression of group IIA PLA2 was up-regulated during chemical hypoxia and its contribution to hypoxic injury has been demonstrated (17Wang H. Harrison-Shostak D.C. Lemasters J.J. Herman B. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1318-1325Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Despite numerous in vitro data that suggest the important role of the group IIA PLA2 in inflammation and cell injury, it should be noted that in vivo models of injury have not always supported such a destructive role for group IIA PLA2. For example, transgenic mice expressing high levels of group IIA PLA2 do not develop any overt inflammatory conditions. No abnormalities were found in any tissue other than skin, where alopecia, epidermal hyperplasia, adnexal hyerplasia, and hyperkeratosis were observed (42Grass D.S. Felkner R.H. Chiang M.Y. Wallace R.E. Nevalainen T.J. Bennett C.F. Swanson M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2233-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Several mouse strains have been found to contain a frameshift mutation in group IIA PLA2, resulting in loss of the enzyme activity. Infection of group IIA PLA2 (−/−) mice (C57BL/6) with Helicobacter felis, a gastroduodenal pathogen, lead to increased apoptosis and proliferation compared with group IIA PLA2 (+/+) BALB/c and C3H/HeJ mouse (43Wang T.C. Goldenring J.R. Dangler C. Ito S. Mueller A. Jeon W.K. Fox J.G. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 675-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Much more marked inflammatory and proliferative response to H. felis was also observed in another group IIA PLA2 (−/−) mouse SV129 than in PLA2 (+/+) mice (43Wang T.C. Goldenring J.R. Dangler C. Ito S. Mueller A. Jeon W.K. Fox J.G. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 675-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). No satisfactory explanation has been proposed for this contradiction. One possible reason is that sPLA2contributes to some extent in the destruction of pathogen in PLA2 (+/+) mice. During the course of these studies, we noted that cells stably expressing group IIA PLA2 were more resistant to apoptosis induced by serum starvation. This protective role of group IIA PLA2 in serum withdrawal-induced apoptosis was further confirmed using a number of other approaches including PLA2inhibitors and site-directed mutagenesis of group IIA PLA2His-47. Because the lipid mediators AA and LPA could not mimic the effects of group IIA PLA2, it appears that other mechanisms are responsible for the protective physiological function of group IIA PLA2. Interestingly, although LPA had no effect in BHK and HQ cells, it did promote survival in NP cells. As LPA can transduce survival signals via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (43Wang T.C. Goldenring J.R. Dangler C. Ito S. Mueller A. Jeon W.K. Fox J.G. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 675-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 44Koh J.S. Lieberthal W. Heydrick S. Levine J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 716-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), it is possible that the group IIA PLA2 and LPA might synergistically transduce survival signals in fibroblasts. How group IIA PLA2 generates survival signals remains to be elucidated. Group I PLA2 can stimulate cell proliferation by binding to a receptors (45Levine J.S. Koh J.S. Triaca V. Lieberthal W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F575-F585PubMed Google Scholar). Whether group IIA PLA2 has its own receptors or can bind to group I PLA2 receptors of BHK cells is unknown. Given the similarity between group I and IIA PLA2, it is possible that group IIA PLA2 may activate a survival pathway by a similar mechanism. If so, this might also explain why PLA2 possesses some functions independent of its hydrolytic activity. Secretory PLA2 has been identified as enhancing factor that enhances the binding of epidermal growth factor to cells (47Mulherkar R. Rao A.S. Wagle A.S. Patki V. Deo M.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 1254-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It is possible that rat group IIA PLA2 may trigger anti-apoptotic signaling via epidermal growth factor. Alternatively, group IIA PLA2 may affect the receptor signaling via modifying membrane topology. The anti-apoptotic activity of group IIA PLA2 also may explain the pathogenesis of certain clinical diseases. It has been reported that the use of certain Chinese herbs containing aristolochic acid for weight loss may cause severe renal failure (48Violon C. J. Pharm. Belg. 1997; 52: 7-27PubMed Google Scholar). As aristolochic acid inhibits group IIA PLA2 activity, it seems likely that aristolochic acid inhibition of PLA2-mediated signaling may contribute to the renal injury seen in these patients. The immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A has the well known side effect of nephrotoxicity (49Healy E. Dempsy M. Lally C. Ryan M.P. Kidney Int. 1998; 54: 1955-1966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Cyclosporin A has been shown to down-regulate mRNA level of group IIA PLA2 in mesangial cells (50Walker G. Kunz D. Pignat W. van den Bosch H. Pfeilschifter J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). If group IIA PLA2generates anti-apoptotic signals in kidney, long-term use of cyclosporin A may impair group IIA PLA2-medited survival signal transduction. Group IIA PLA2 is transcriptionally up-regulated by inflammatory cytokines, partially via NFκB (50Walker G. Kunz D. Pignat W. van den Bosch H. Pfeilschifter J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). NFκB is believed to protect against tumor necrosis factor-induced cell death by inducing the expression of anti-apoptotic genes (51Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar). High levels of group IIA PLA2 is present at inflammatory sites, and the physiological role of the protein in inflammation remains largely unknown. Our results suggest the possibility that group IIA PLA2 might counteract the effects caused by some pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor that promotes cell death.

Most of these processes are aided by eIF3, the most complex of all the initiation factors described so far (reviewed in Ref. 1Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N.

A similar model has recently also been postulated for mammals (21Bandyopadhyay A. Maitra U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1331-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Genetic approaches in yeast resulted in cloning of several genes coding for translation initiation factors or their subunits (eIF4B, eIF2, eIF2B, and eIF3) (for reviews, see Refs. 1Merrick W.C.

Involvement of Rpg1p in the process of translation initiation was clearly demonstrated in a cell-free system dependent on exogenous eIF3 (25Altmann M. Trachsel H. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1997; 11: 343-352Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar): we showed that the sucrose gradient fraction containing Rpg1p possesses the biochemical activity ascribed to eIF3, e.g. the restoration of translation in an extract in which an endogenous eIF3 subunit had been inactivated.

In addition, it has been also proposed to bind eIF4B (7Methot N. Song M.S. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5328-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and to be necessary for binding and stabilization of the ternary complex (27Gupta N.K. Roy A.L. Nag M.K. Kinzy T.G. MacMillan S.

We have demonstrated that this protein is not able to replace yeast Rpg1p in the functional rescue experiment. Up to now, none of the mammalian eIF3 subunits has worked in a similar type of experiment (26Methot N. Rom E. Olsen H. Sonenberg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1110-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 28Naranda T. Kainuma M. MacMillan S. Hershey J.W.B. Mol. Cell.

Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32286-32292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to Prt1p, yeast Rpg1p has recently been shown to interact with Nip1p (9Asano K. Phan L. Anderson J. Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18573-18585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Nip1p also interacts with Sui1p and eIF5 (19Phan L. Zhang X. Asano K. Anderson J. Vornlocher H.-P. Greenberg J.R. Quin J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4935-4946Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), both of which are involved in the start codon recognition process previously not considered to be influenced by eIF3. It is clear that further experiments are needed to define the complex spectrum of eIF3 functions. Thus, biochemical strategies and genetic studies carried out with the eIF3 core complex subunits can help to reveal important interactions between either eIF3 subunits themselves and/or with other components of the translational apparatus and subsequently to better understand the function of eIF3 in translation initiation.To learn more about the large subunit of yeast eIF3 and its physiological interactions, a multicopy suppressor study was carried out to identify proteins that can functionally complement the temperature-sensitive phenotype of the rpg1-1 ts allele. Here, we present biochemical and genetic data demonstrating that the nonessential S. cerevisiae HCR1 gene (high copy suppressor ofR PG 1) codes for a protein that appears to be the yeast homologue of the p35 subunit of mammalian eIF3 and that, in high dosage, partially suppresses the growth defect of the rpg1-1 ts mutant caused by incubation at the restrictive temperature. Moreover, both Hcr1 and Rpg1 proteins were shown to interact with each other, which in light of the previously described interaction between their mammalian homologues, eIF3-p35 and eIF3-p170 (29Block K.L. Vornlocher H.-P. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31901-31908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), suggests a possible involvement of Hcr1p in translation initiation.DISCUSSIONIn a high dosage suppressor screen of therpg1-1 ts mutation, a novel nonessential S. cerevisiae gene named HCR1 was isolated. The screen appeared to be saturated and highly specific as illustrated by the fact that, besides the RPG1 gene (19 clones), 15 additional clones were isolated, all of which contained the HCR1 gene. In high dosage, the Hcr1 protein suppresses therpg1-1 ts mutant, but does not rescue therpg1 null mutant (a Rpg1p-depleted strain); hence, it does not bypass the requirement of Rpg1p for growth. The deletion of theHCR1 gene resulted in a slight reduction of the growth rate and a significant reduction of the mating ability of the corresponding strain. In an immunoprecipitation experiment, Hcr1p was shown to associate with Rpg1p. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the deletion ofHCR1 in combination with the rpg1-1 ts mutation leads to a synthetic enhancement of the slow growth phenotype of the rpg1-1 ts mutant at the semipermissive temperature. These data indicate that the two proteins interact both physically and genetically. Taken together with the facts that Hcr1p shares ∼27% identity and 42% similarity with the p35 subunit of human eIF3 and that the latter protein was shown to associate with eIF3-p170 (29Block K.L. Vornlocher H.-P. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31901-31908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), i.e. the mammalian homologue of yeast Rpg1p (5Johnston K.J. Merrick W.C. Zoll W.L. Zhu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7106-7113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we suggest that Hcr1p represents the yeast homologue of eIF3-p35.At present, we can only speculate about the mechanism by which Hcr1p suppresses the rpg1-1 ts mutation. Enhanced levels of the Hcr1 protein may stabilize just Rpg1p or the entire multisubunit eIF3 complex at the restrictive temperature by specific protein-protein interaction or may stimulate one or several of the eIF3 activities in the cell, i.e. binding of the ternary complex Met-tRNAi·eIF2·GTP or mRNA to the 40 S ribosome. This would be somewhat reminiscent of Tif35p, another subunit of yeast eIF3. This protein was identified as a multicopy suppressor of atif34 ts mutation and shown to directly interact with Tif34p (13Verlhac M.-H. Chen R.-H. Hanachi P. Hershey J.W.B. Derynck R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6812-6822Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Tif34p plays a central role in the assembly of the subunits of eIF3 into the multiprotein complex (28Naranda T. Kainuma M. MacMillan S. Hershey J.W.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To address, at least partly, the question of whether Hcr1p works as a factor involved in assembly and/or maintenance of eIF3, we also tested whether it acts as a multicopy suppressor of the prt1-1 ts mutation. This is not the case. This might mean that the suppressor effect is Rpg1p-specific, i.e. suppression occurs at the level of the translation initiation block, if applicable, caused by therpg1-1 ts mutation.An alternative possibility is that a high dosage of Hcr1p stabilizesRPG1 mRNA. In this case, the elevated level of the rpg1-1 ts protein would result in sufficient Rpg1p activity to allow slow growth of cells. However, Northern blot analysis and the fact that overexpression of the rpg1-1 ts protein in therpg1-1 ts mutant does not rescue growth clearly contradict this possibility.When we analyzed the suppression of the rpg1-1 ts mutation by overexpression of Hcr1p by measuring the growth rates of the corresponding strains, we noticed that it is rather weak (Fig. 3). We do not know yet the precise function of Rpg1p and hence the biochemical defect conferred by the rpg1-1 ts mutation. However, since Rpg1p is involved in translation initiation, we assume that Hcr1p overexpression partially corrects the translation initiation defect. Rpg1p, the largest subunit of the eIF3 core complex, may have several functions, and the rpg1-1 ts mutation may impair more than one of them. The weak suppression ofrpg1-1 by HCR1 might then be explained by suppression of only some of the affected functions of the rpg1-1 protein by Hcr1p. This would be sufficient to overcome the G1 arrest and to reinitiate budding (likely by enhancing the rate of the otherwise severely reduced protein synthesis).If Hcr1p is involved in translation initiation as suggested by the suppression of the ts mutation in the RPG1(TIF32) gene and from its homology to the human eIF3-p35 subunit, one might have expected that the deletion of theHCR1 gene would be lethal. However, this is not the case. Other nonessential genes encoding translation initiation factors areSTM1, encoding the yeast homologue of mammalian eIF4B, which was identified as a multicopy suppressor of the eIF4A ts mutation (24Coppolecchia R. Buser P. Stotz A. Linder P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4005-4011Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar); and GCN3, encoding a subunit of the nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B (43Hanning E.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4808-4820Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Gcn3p is a regulatory subunit of eIF2B and plays an important role in up-regulation of translation of GCN4mRNA under conditions of amino acid starvation (44Pawitt G.D. Ramaiah K.V.A. Kimball S.R. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 514-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In analogy to Gcn3p, it is tempting to speculate that Hcr1p might be a regulator of eIF3 activity, acting by binding to Rpg1p under special physiological conditions, but being dispensable for eIF3 activities under normal growth conditions. In accordance with this possibility, Hcr1p was found not to belong to the firmly associated eIF3 complex referred to as the eIF3 core complex (8Danaie P. Wittmer B. Altmann M. Trachsel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4288-4292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 9Asano K. Phan L. Anderson J. Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18573-18585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Together with other proteins, among them Sui1p and maybe Gcd10p, Hcr1p may belong to a group of eIF3-associated proteins whose functions await elucidation. Moreover, when Hershey and co-workers (29Block K.L. Vornlocher H.-P. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31901-31908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) analyzed human eIF3-p35, they found it to be a very “sticky” protein, interacting with nearly all subunits of human eIF3, especially with p66 and the p170 homologue of yeast Rpg1p. Further experiments are necessary to find the function for Hcr1p in the translation initiation machinery and to explain the functional connection with Rpg1p (Tif32p). This may lead to a better understanding of the function of the p35 subunit of the human eIF3 complex. Eukaryotes initiate protein synthesis by dissociation of an 80 S ribosome into 40 S and 60 S subunits, formation of the Met-tRNAi·eIF21·GTP ternary complex and binding of this complex to the 40 S subunit, joining the resulting 43 S preinitiation complex with mRNA, and finally, formation of the 48 S initiation complex at the initiation codon, followed by addition of the 60 S ribosomal subunit. Most of these processes are aided by eIF3, the most complex of all the initiation factors described so far (reviewed in Ref. 1Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 31-69Google Scholar). This factor is believed to prevent premature association of 40 S and 60 S ribosomal subunits, to stabilize the ternary complex bound to the 40 S ribosomal subunit, and to promote the binding of the 43 S preinitiation complex to mRNA (2Benne R.

This core complex was found to be associated with additional proteins, among them Sui1p and Gcd10p (16Naranda T. MacMillan S.E. Donahue F. Hershey J.W.B. Mol. Cell.

However, the latter was shown to be involved in specific initiator methionyl-tRNA modification during its maturation, and its role as an eIF3-associated protein (if any) is unclear (18Anderson J.

A similar model has recently also been postulated for mammals (21Bandyopadhyay A. Maitra U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1331-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Genetic approaches in yeast resulted in cloning of several genes coding for translation initiation factors or their subunits (eIF4B, eIF2, eIF2B, and eIF3) (for reviews, see Refs. 1Merrick W.C.

For instance, a multicopy suppressor screen done with a temperature-sensitive allele of the known eIF3 subunit Tif34p resulted in identification of another eIF3 subunit, eIF3-p33 (Tif35p) (13Verlhac M.-H.

Another example is theSTM1/TIF3 gene, the protein product of which was identified as a multicopy suppressor of a temperature-sensitive mutation in eIF4A and shown to represent the yeast homologue of mammalian eIF4B (24Coppolecchia R. Buser P. Stotz A. Linder P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4005-4011Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).

To address, at least partly, the question of whether Hcr1p works as a factor involved in assembly and/or maintenance of eIF3, we also tested whether it acts as a multicopy suppressor of the prt1-1 ts mutation. This is not the case. This might mean that the suppressor effect is Rpg1p-specific, i.e. suppression occurs at the level of the translation initiation block, if applicable, caused by therpg1-1 ts mutation.An alternative possibility is that a high dosage of Hcr1p stabilizesRPG1 mRNA. In this case, the elevated level of the rpg1-1 ts protein would result in sufficient Rpg1p activity to allow slow growth of cells. However, Northern blot analysis and the fact that overexpression of the rpg1-1 ts protein in therpg1-1 ts mutant does not rescue growth clearly contradict this possibility.When we analyzed the suppression of the rpg1-1 ts mutation by overexpression of Hcr1p by measuring the growth rates of the corresponding strains, we noticed that it is rather weak (Fig. 3). We do not know yet the precise function of Rpg1p and hence the biochemical defect conferred by the rpg1-1 ts mutation. However, since Rpg1p is involved in translation initiation, we assume that Hcr1p overexpression partially corrects the translation initiation defect. Rpg1p, the largest subunit of the eIF3 core complex, may have several functions, and the rpg1-1 ts mutation may impair more than one of them. The weak suppression ofrpg1-1 by HCR1 might then be explained by suppression of only some of the affected functions of the rpg1-1 protein by Hcr1p. This would be sufficient to overcome the G1 arrest and to reinitiate budding (likely by enhancing the rate of the otherwise severely reduced protein synthesis).If Hcr1p is involved in translation initiation as suggested by the suppression of the ts mutation in the RPG1(TIF32) gene and from its homology to the human eIF3-p35 subunit, one might have expected that the deletion of theHCR1 gene would be lethal. However, this is not the case. Other nonessential genes encoding translation initiation factors areSTM1, encoding the yeast homologue of mammalian eIF4B, which was identified as a multicopy suppressor of the eIF4A ts mutation (24Coppolecchia R. Buser P. Stotz A. Linder P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4005-4011Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar); and GCN3, encoding a subunit of the nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B (43Hanning E.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4808-4820Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Gcn3p is a regulatory subunit of eIF2B and plays an important role in up-regulation of translation of GCN4mRNA under conditions of amino acid starvation (44Pawitt G.D. Ramaiah K.V.A. Kimball S.R. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 514-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In analogy to Gcn3p, it is tempting to speculate that Hcr1p might be a regulator of eIF3 activity, acting by binding to Rpg1p under special physiological conditions, but being dispensable for eIF3 activities under normal growth conditions. In accordance with this possibility, Hcr1p was found not to belong to the firmly associated eIF3 complex referred to as the eIF3 core complex (8Danaie P. Wittmer B. Altmann M. Trachsel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4288-4292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 9Asano K. Phan L. Anderson J. Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18573-18585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Together with other proteins, among them Sui1p and maybe Gcd10p, Hcr1p may belong to a group of eIF3-associated proteins whose functions await elucidation. Moreover, when Hershey and co-workers (29Block K.L. Vornlocher H.-P. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31901-31908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) analyzed human eIF3-p35, they found it to be a very “sticky” protein, interacting with nearly all subunits of human eIF3, especially with p66 and the p170 homologue of yeast Rpg1p. Further experiments are necessary to find the function for Hcr1p in the translation initiation machinery and to explain the functional connection with Rpg1p (Tif32p). This may lead to a better understanding of the function of the p35 subunit of the human eIF3 complex. In a high dosage suppressor screen of therpg1-1 ts mutation, a novel nonessential S. cerevisiae gene named HCR1 was isolated. The screen appeared to be saturated and highly specific as illustrated by the fact that, besides the RPG1 gene (19 clones), 15 additional clones were isolated, all of which contained the HCR1 gene. In high dosage, the Hcr1 protein suppresses therpg1-1 ts mutant, but does not rescue therpg1 null mutant (a Rpg1p-depleted strain); hence, it does not bypass the requirement of Rpg1p for growth. The deletion of theHCR1 gene resulted in a slight reduction of the growth rate and a significant reduction of the mating ability of the corresponding strain. In an immunoprecipitation experiment, Hcr1p was shown to associate with Rpg1p. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the deletion ofHCR1 in combination with the rpg1-1 ts mutation leads to a synthetic enhancement of the slow growth phenotype of the rpg1-1 ts mutant at the semipermissive temperature. These data indicate that the two proteins interact both physically and genetically. Taken together with the facts that Hcr1p shares ∼27% identity and 42% similarity with the p35 subunit of human eIF3 and that the latter protein was shown to associate with eIF3-p170 (29Block K.L. Vornlocher H.-P. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31901-31908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), i.e. the mammalian homologue of yeast Rpg1p (5Johnston K.J. Merrick W.C. Zoll W.L. Zhu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7106-7113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we suggest that Hcr1p represents the yeast homologue of eIF3-p35. At present, we can only speculate about the mechanism by which Hcr1p suppresses the rpg1-1 ts mutation. Enhanced levels of the Hcr1 protein may stabilize just Rpg1p or the entire multisubunit eIF3 complex at the restrictive temperature by specific protein-protein interaction or may stimulate one or several of the eIF3 activities in the cell, i.e. binding of the ternary complex Met-tRNAi·eIF2·GTP or mRNA to the 40 S ribosome. This would be somewhat reminiscent of Tif35p, another subunit of yeast eIF3. This protein was identified as a multicopy suppressor of atif34 ts mutation and shown to directly interact with Tif34p (13Verlhac M.-H. Chen R.-H. Hanachi P. Hershey J.W.B. Derynck R.

Here, we examine the regulation of COX-2 promoter activity by α subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins in NIH 3T3 cells. Using a transient transfection assay with a reporter vector in which the murine COX-2 promoter drives the production of luciferase and expression vectors encoding for α subunits of G-proteins, we show that overexpression of wild type and constitutively active Gα13 and Gαqinduced transcription from the COX-2 promoter. The highest level of induced luciferase activity (5.8-fold) occurred in cells expressing the constitutively active Gα13(Q226L). We also show that expression of a constitutively active mutant of Rho (RhoQ63L) also induced transcription from the COX-2 promoter. Co-expression ofClostridium botulinum C3 toxin specifically blocked induction of the COX-2 promoter by either Gα13Q226L or RhoQ63L but did not prevent the activation of this promoter by Ras, Rac, v-src, or forskolin. We conclude that Gα13 signals through a Rho-dependent pathway leading to activation of the COX-2 promoter. This pathway is not inhibited by either cytochalasin D, which disrupts actin filament organization, or genistein, a broad spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitor, indicating a bifurcation of the signaling pathway used by Gα13/Rho to induce COX-2 expression from that used to induce stress fiber formation and tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins.

These pathways converge onto a common regulatory region, the ATF/cAMP response element located between −56 and −48 of the murine COX-2 promoter (22Xie W. Fletcher B.S. Andersen R.D. Herschman H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6531-6539Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that COX-2 expression also is induced by activation of the seven transmembrane domain receptor for bombesin (26Hecht J.R. Duque J. Reddy S.T. Herschman H.R. Walsh J.H. Slice L.W. Prostaglandins. 1997; 54: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), which interacts with both of the Gq and G12 families of heterotrimeric G-proteins (27Rozengurt E. J. Cell.

The small G-protein Rho plays a critical role in many biological responses induced by Gα12/13 (37Fromm C. Coso O.A. Montaner S. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Here, we examined whether the Gα13/Rho pathway leads to transcriptional activation of COX-2. Our results show that mutationally activated or aluminum fluoride-stimulated Gα13 induces activation of the COX-2 promoter through a Rho-dependent pathway. COX-2 expression by Gα13/Rho can be dissociated from stress fiber formation, focal adhesion assembly, and tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins, indicating a bifurcation of the signaling pathway used by Gα13/Rho to induce COX-2 expression from that used to induce actin cytoskeleton reorganization.

The cells were plated onto 60-mm dishes (Nunc, Napierville, IL) at a density of 105/plate. The next day, a transfection mixture was prepared by adding 1.5 μg of the reporter plasmid into 150 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with a combination of pcDNA-3 and the appropriate expression vector (totaling 1.0 μg). After a 20-min incubation after the addition of SuperFect (5 μl, Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA), the transfection mixture was combined with 1.0 ml of fresh medium and placed onto the cells in 60-mm plates. The cells were incubated for 2 days, and then the media was replaced with low serum media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.1% calf serum and 0.1% bovine serum albumin). The next day, the cells were harvested with or without treatment with inhibitor (5 h), which in preliminary experiments was determined to be the optimal time for detection of changes in luciferase expression. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed with luciferase assay buffer (400 μl, Promega, Madison, WI). The cell particulate was removed by brief centrifugation, and the protein concentration was measured using a protein assay Kit (Bio-Rad). Luciferase assays were performed using a Turner TD20/20 luminometer, with 90 μl of luciferase reaction mix (Promega, Madison, WI) mixed with 20 μl of protein extract. The relative light units (RLU) were normalized for the amount of protein in each extract, and the results were reported as relative changes in luciferase activity with a relative fold increase of 1.0, signifying no change. The data was reported as the mean value ± S.E. from two or more sets of transfections that were done in triplicate. Cytochalasin D, forskolin, and genistein were purchased from Calbiochem. AlCl3 and NaF were purchased from Sigma. Gastrin-releasing peptide was purchased from Bachem (Torrance, CA), and epidermal growth factor was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. NIH 3T3 cells were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips. The cells were incubated with and without cytochalasin D (2 μm, 30 min) before exposure to media containing 20% calf serum. After 10 min, the cells were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature for 10 min. The cells were treated with rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) according to manufacturer's protocol. The fluorescent image was acquired by a Spot-2 CCD camera attached to a Zeiss Axioskop microscope using a rhodamine filter set (Chroma #41002c). NIH cells were serum-starved overnight before a 1-h incubation with or without genistein (50 μm). The cells were harvested 10 min after exposure to epidermal growth factor (50 ng/ml). Proteins were separated by size using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose. The immobilized proteins were screened using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (4G10, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) and ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To determine whether Gα13 can regulate COX-2 expression, NIH 3T3 cells were co-transfected with a reporter plasmid in which the production of luciferase is driven by the COX-2 promoter (−371 to +70) and expression vectors encoding wild type Gα13 or constitutively activated Gα13(Gα13Q226L). As shown in Fig. 1 A, expression of Gα13Q226L induced a marked concentration-dependent increase in COX-2 promoter activity. The maximal increase in relative luciferase activity was 5.8-fold in cells transfected with 0.25 μg of plasmid compared with control cells transfected with pcDNA-3. Expression of wild type Gα13 also induced higher levels of luciferase activity with a maximal relative increase of 2.9-fold that was achieved in cells transfected with 0.25 μg of plasmid. The relative high activity of the wild type Gα13 could be due to the low level of GTPase activity of this Gα subunit (42Singer W.D. Miller R.T. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19796-19802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Macrez-Lepretre N. Kalkbrenner F. Morel J.L. Schultz G. Mironneau J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10095-10102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The results presented in Fig. 1 A show for the first time that Gα13signaling leads to activation of the COX-2 promoter. Signaling by Gαq activates protein kinase C via phospholipase Cβ, and it is known that direct protein kinase C stimulation by phorbol esters induces COX-2 expression in NIH 3T3 cells (26Hecht J.R. Duque J. Reddy S.T. Herschman H.R. Walsh J.H. Slice L.W. Prostaglandins. 1997; 54: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 28Herschman H.R. Kujubu D.A. Fletcher B.S. Ma Q. Varnum B.C. Gilbert R.S. Reddy S.T. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 47: 113-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Consequently, we tested the effects of wild type and constitutively activated Gαq on COX-2 promoter-mediated gene transcription. Using the same conditions (0.25 μg of expression vector) that were employed for maximal Gα13-induced transcriptional activation of COX-2, expression of GαqQ209L resulted in a 3.2-fold relative increase in luciferase activity (Fig. 1 B). To determine whether the effects of Gα13Q226L arose from long term activation of signaling pathways leading to secretion of autocrine factors or altered expression of Gα13regulators, we examined Gα13 signaling in an acutely regulated system. Aluminum fluoride activates heterotrimeric G-proteins by its ability to mimic the γ-phosphoryl group of GTP when associated with GDP-bound α-subunits (44Wu D.Q. Lee C.H. Rhee S.G. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1811-1817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Plonk S.G. Park S.-K. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4823-4826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We co-transfected NIH cells with wild type Gα13 and with the reporter plasmid, and after 72 h, the cells were exposed to 2.5 μm aluminum fluoride for 5 h (Fig.2 A). Treatment with aluminum fluoride significantly increased luciferase activity in cells overexpressing wild type Gα13. In contrast, aluminum fluoride induced luciferase activity only slightly in cells transfected with the COX-2 promoter reporter vector and a control vector (i.e. in the absence of Gα13 overexpression). Furthermore, conditioned media collected from cells overexpressing either Gα13 (wild type or QL mutant) or Gαq(wild type or QL mutant) did not induce any significant increase in luciferase activity (Fig. 2 B) when added to cells transfected with the COX-2 promoter reporter vector. The results shown in Fig. 2 indicate that the activation of the COX-2 promoter by the α subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins is not caused by the release of autocrine factors during the course of the experiments. Recent evidence has shown that the small G-protein Rho mediates some of the biological effects induced by Gα13 (37Fromm C. Coso O.A. Montaner S. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10098-100103Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 38Collins L.R. Minden A. Karin M. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17349-17353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To test whether activation of the COX-2 promoter involves a Rho-signaling pathway, cells were co-transfected with the COX-2 promoter and either pcDNA-3 (control) or expression vectors encoding wild type or constitutively active Rho (RhoQ63L). The results presented in Fig.3 A show for the first time that cells overexpressing RhoQ63L exhibit a 3-fold relative increase in luciferase activity compared with either control cells or cells overexpressing wild type Rho. The results indicate that Rho activation is a potential pathway leading to COX-2 transcriptional activation. The Clostridium botulinum C3 toxin, which specifically ADP-ribosylates Rho at residue 41 and impairs its function (46Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar), was used to test whether activation of the COX-2 promoter by Gα13 proceeds through a Rho-dependent pathway. Expression of C3 toxin blocked the increase in the level of luciferase activity produced in cells expressing either the RhoQ63L or Gα13Q226L (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, C3 toxin did not prevent the increase in luciferase activity induced by treatment with forskolin, which stimulates COX-2 promoter activity via cAMP. These results indicate that Rho mediates COX-2 promoter activation by Gα13. Previous studies have shown that the COX-2 promoter is induced by constitutively active Ras and Rac (22Xie W. Fletcher B.S. Andersen R.D. Herschman H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6531-6539Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 23Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 31742-31748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that Gα13Q226L requires functional Rac to stimulate Na+/H+ antiport activity (47Wadsworth S.J. Gebauer G. van Rossum G.D. Dhanasekaran N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28829-28832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether Ras or Rac are required for COX-2 promoter activation by Gα13 or Rho. Expression of Ras and Rac or dominant negative forms of Ras, RasDN, and Rac, RacDN did not affect the level of activation of the COX-2 promoter by Gα13Q226L (Fig.4 A). As a positive control, we confirmed that expression of RasDN and RacDN significantly reduced v-src-dependent activation of the COX-2 promoter (Fig.4 B). These results indicate that induction of the COX-2 promoter by Gα13Q226L is not dependent on Ras or Rac signaling pathways. We next wanted to determine the specificity of C3 toxin effects on small GTPase-dependent activation of the COX-2 promoter. We confirmed that in our experimental system, the constitutive active V12 forms of both Ras and Rac induced the COX-2 promoter (Fig.4 C). In contrast to RhoQ63L, expression of C3 toxin did not inhibit the relative luciferase induction by RasV12, RacV12, or v-src. This demonstrates selective inhibition of Rho by C3 toxin. There was a slight increase in the relative luciferase induction by RasV12, RacV12, v-src, and forskolin in cells expressing C3 toxin. This could be attributed to a lower basal level of luciferase activity in cells expressing C3 toxin. This supports an earlier proposal that NIH 3T3 cells have an elevated basal level of Rho activity (48Hotchin N.A. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1857-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Next, we determined whether agonist binding to the GRP receptor, which induces COX-2 mRNA and COX-2 (26Hecht J.R. Duque J. Reddy S.T. Herschman H.R. Walsh J.H. Slice L.W. Prostaglandins. 1997; 54: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), leads to activation of the COX-2 promoter via the Gα13/Rho pathway. NIH 3T3 cells were co-transfected with the reporter plasmid and an expression vector containing the GRP receptor cDNA. The cells were challenged with GRP for 5 h and then assayed for luciferase activity. GRP induced luciferase activity over 4-fold compared with unchallenged cells (Fig.4 D). Cells not transfected with the GRP receptor expression vector did not respond to GRP (data not shown). Expression of C3 toxin strikingly inhibited GRP-dependent induction of luciferase activity. These results indicate that GRP, through the GRP receptor, induces COX-2 promoter activity primarily through a Gα13/Rho-dependent pathway. Rho mediates multiple signaling pathways including gene expression, tyrosine phosphorylation, and stress fiber formation (49Seasholtz T.M. Majumdar M. Brown J.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 949-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Expression of either Gα13Q226L or RhoQ63L stimulates the formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesion contacts leading to the tyrosine phosphorylation of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase p125FAK and of the adapter proteins paxillin and p130CAS (35Needham L.K.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We examined if activation of the COX-2 promoter by Gα13 or Rho is dependent on actin cytoskeleton remodeling and/or tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins. Treatment of NIH 3T3 cells with cytochalasin D under conditions that disrupted actin stress fibers, as shown by phalloidin staining (Fig.5 C), did not prevent the activation of the COX-2 promoter by Gα13Q226L (Fig.5 A). To determine whether activation of the COX-2 promoter by Gα13 was through a tyrosine kinase-dependent pathway, cells were treated with increasing concentrations of the broad-spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein. Inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity did not prevent activation of the COX-2 promoter by Gα13Q226L (Fig. 5 B). In fact, the relative luciferase activity levels increased in the cultures exposed to higher doses of genistein (50 μm). This high dose of genistein inhibited epidermal growth factor-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 5 D). The results obtained with both genistein and cytochalasin D suggest that activation of the COX-2 promoter by Gα13 is not dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins. COX-2 is a prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase that is dramatically induced by multiple extracellular stimuli and oncogene products (7DeWitt D.L. Kraemer S.A. Meade E.A. Adv. Prostaglandin Thromboxane Leukotriene Res. 1991; 21: 65-68Google Scholar, 8DuBois R.N. Tsujii M. Bishop P. Awad J.A. Makita K. Lanahan A. Am. J.

Chem. 1991; 266: 14511-14518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given the pivotal role of inducible prostaglandin production in many normal and abnormal processes, the transcriptional regulation of COX-2 expression is the subject of intense interest. Our results demonstrate for the first time that mutationally activated or aluminum fluoride-stimulated Gα13 induces the activation of the COX-2 promoter. These findings identify a novel regulatory mechanism leading to COX-2 promoter activation and raise the possibility that COX-2 induction is a downstream event in Gα13 signaling. Activated Gα13 induces a variety of biological responses including stimulation of Na+/H+ antiport activity, stress fiber and focal adhesion formation, and tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins through Rho (35Needham L.K. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14626-14632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 47Wadsworth S.J. Gebauer G. van Rossum G.D. Dhanasekaran N. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the recent observation that expression of constitutively active Gα13 increases the level of active Rho (Rho-GTP) (54Gohla A. Harhammer R. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4653-4659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Here, we report for the first time that expression of constitutively activated Rho induces activation of the COX-2 promoter. Furthermore, our results also show that inactivation of Rho by C. botulinum C3 toxin selectively blocks induction of COX-2 promoter activity by Gα13, Rho, and by the GRP receptor. Neither Ras or Rac is downstream of Gα13 nor is Rho downstream of Ras or Rac in the pathway(s) leading to COX-2 promoter activation. In addition, signaling to the COX-2 promoter by Gα13/Rho can be dissociated from both cytoskeletal reorganization and tyrosine phosphorylation pathways. Taken together, the findings presented here indicate that the Gα13-Rho pathway provides a novel mechanism leading to COX-2 promoter activation. Increasing evidence indicates that overexpression of COX-2 contributes to the development of a variety of human cancers (1DuBois R.N. Abramson S.B. Crofford L. Gupta R.A. Simon L.S. Van De Putte L.B. Lipsky P.E. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1063-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2231) Google Scholar). It is also known that constitutively activated Gα13 can act as a potent oncogene (31Xu N. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T. Gutkind J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 32Xu N. Bradley L. Ambdukar I. Gutkind J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Kurzawa H. Lebowitz P.F. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2289-2296PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, constitutive or autocrine stimulation of heptahelical receptors that couple to Gα13 and Rho are also implicated in tumorogenesis (56Rozengurt E. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1999; 11: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 57Ferris H.A. Carroll R.E. Rasenick M.M. Benya R.V. J. Clin.

Our results identifying a novel link between Gα13, Rho, and COX-2 suggest that this pathway may contribute to tumor development in at least some cell types, a proposition that warrants further experimental work.

In the present work we show that the kinetics of channel gating and presumably the rate of ATP hydrolysis depends on the species of divalent cation present and the oxidation state of the protein. With Ca2+ as the dominant divalent cation instead of Mg2+, the open burst duration of the channel is increased approximately 20-fold, and this change is reversible upon washout of Ca2+. In contrast, “soft” divalent cations such as Cd2+ interact covalently with cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). These metals decrease both opening and closing rates of the channel, and the effects are not reversed by washout. Oxidation of CFTR channels with a variety of oxidants resulted in a similar slowing of channel gating. In contrast, reducing agents had the opposite effect, increasing both opening and closing rates of the channel. In cell-attached patches, CFTR channels exhibit both oxidized and reduced types of gating, raising the possibility that regulation of the redox state of the channel may be a physiological mode of control of CFTR channel activity.

Direct measurement of ATPase activity in purified reconstituted CFTR has confirmed that it functions as an ATPase, and the measured turnover rate of the phosphorylated form (0.5–1 s−1) is consistent with a model in which opening and closing of the CFTR channel gate is coupled directly to ATP hydrolysis (13Li C.

These papers presented models in which two ATP hydrolytic events, one occurring at NBF1 and one at NBF2, are involved first in opening and then closing the CFTR channel. In one model a single cycle of ATP hydrolysis occurs at NBF1 to directly open the channel (8Gadsby D.C. Nairn A.C. Trends Biochem.

Alternatively, a second model proposes that ATP hydrolysis at NBF1 converts the channel into a gatable state from which nucleotide binding at NBF2 can then open the channel (15Gunderson K.L.

In both models, once the channel is open, the duration of the open burst is regulated by the hydrolysis rate of ATP at NBF2, with hydrolysis at NBF2 terminating the burst. Channel closure may occur either directly through the release of hydrolysis end products (ADP and inorganic phosphate) from NBF2 or indirectly by altering the hydrolysis rate or product off-rate at NBF1.In addition to the nucleotide-dependent gating of CFTR, phosphorylation of the R domain plays an essential role in regulating channel gating. In its highly phosphorylated state, CFTR channels display a robust activation by ATP, whereas no channel gating occurs in an unphosphorylated state even in the presence of large concentrations of ATP (9Anderson M.P.

Although phosphorylation is critical for channel gating, the mechanism by which the phosphorylated R domain interacts with ATP hydrolysis by the NBFs to control channel gating is poorly understood. In addition, it has been observed in patch clamp experiments that CFTR channel openings have a heterogeneity that is not completely explained by ATP concentrations or phosphorylation state (18Haws C. Finkbeiner W.E. Widdicombe J.H. Wine J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: L502-L512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Schultz B.D. Bridges R.J. Frizzell R.A. J. Membr.

Chem. 1997; 272: 4978-4984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), so that there are probably other factors that regulate CFTR channel activity. One relatively unexplored source of control over CFTR channel gating is the redox potential within the cell. Perfusion of CFTR expressing cells with oxidized or reduced forms of pyridine nucleotides has been shown to modulate both basal and forskolin-stimulated Cl− conductance (21Stutts M.J. Gabriel S.E. Price E.M. Sarkadi B. Olsen J.C. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8667-8674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Perfusion of oxidized purines through the patch pipette increased forskolin-stimulated whole cell Cl− current, whereas reduced purines inhibited the current. Moreover, cell-permeant oxidizing agents elevated the open probability (Po) of CFTR channels in cell-attached patches (21Stutts M.J. Gabriel S.E. Price E.M. Sarkadi B. Olsen J.C. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8667-8674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in an apparent contrast, Koettgenet al. (22Koettgen M. Busch A.E. Gregor M.J. Kunzelmann K. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 431: 548-555Google Scholar) have reported that derivatives of cysteine with anti-oxidant properties increase the Cl− conductance of airway epithelial cells.Although agents that alter the redox environment of the cell seem to affect CFTR channel activity, exactly what causes that effect remains unclear. The obvious targets for redox modulation with the potential to alter channel activity are cysteine residues in the channel protein. The CFTR sequence contains 18 cysteines, 14 of which are predicted to be intracellular. A role for cysteine residues in modulating CFTR channel activity has been demonstrated by Cotten and Welsh (23Cotten J.F. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25617-25622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) who reported that the cysteine-modifying reagentN-ethylmaleimide (NEM) activates CFTR channels in excised patches, an effect that was eliminated by mutation of one cysteine, Cys832 in the R domain.In the present paper we show that the kinetics of channel gating depend on the species of divalent cation present and the oxidation state of the protein. When Mg2+ is replaced by Ca2+ or in the presence of sulfhydryl-reactive cations or oxidizing agents, the channel opens less frequently and closes more slowly, whereas reducing agents increase both the opening and closing rates of CFTR Cl− channels.DISCUSSIONIn this paper we investigated the effects of divalent cations and sulfhydryl modifying reagents on the gating of CFTR channels. The principal findings of this study are that CFTR channel gating kinetics can be influenced by covalent modification of sulfhydryl residues and that channel activity in vivo is subject to modulation by intracellular redox status. Our data also show that Ca2+ions when substituted for Mg2+ dramatically alter CFTR gating via a noncovalent interaction with the protein.Divalent cations serve as useful probes for investigating the role of ATP hydrolysis in gating the CFTR channel because of their requirement in ATP hydrolysis reactions. Many well studied ATPases including P-type ATPases (30Supply P. Wach A. Thines-Sempoux D. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19744-19752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), V-type ATPases (31Arai K. Shimaya A. Hiratani N. Ohkuma S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5649-5660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and ATP-binding cassette transporters such as P-glycoprotein (32Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 18617-18621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) exhibit similar rates of hydrolysis with Mg2+, Mn2+, and Co2+ but are orders of magnitude slower at hydrolyzing Ca2+ ATP. Our finding that replacement of Mg2+ with Ca2+ leads to a large (∼20-fold) increase in the open burst duration of CFTR channels most likely reflects the dramatically slower rate of hydrolysis of Ca2+ ATP compared with Mg2+ ATP and supports previously proposed models of CFTR gating in which an open burst may be terminated by hydrolysis of ATP at NBF2 (14Carson M.R. Travis S.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1711-1717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 15Gunderson K.L. Kopito R.R.

Hwang T.-C. Nairn A.C. Gadsby D.C. Neuron. 1994; 12: 473-482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 11Hwang T.-C. Nagel G. Nairn A.C. Gadsby D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 19349-19353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the stoichiometry of the coupling of ATP hydrolysis to channel opening is controversial. According to one model (8Gadsby D.C. Nairn A.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 513-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 14Carson M.R. Travis S.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1997; 273: C1278-C1289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), initiation of each open burst is directly coupled to hydrolysis of ATP by NBF1. The longer closed times observed in CFTR channels mutated at the invariant lysine (Lys464) in the NBF1 Walker motif are consistent with a role for ATP hydrolysis at NBF1 in the initiation of an open burst. However, the effect of these Lys464 mutations on opening rate is relatively small (2–4-fold), compared with the large (1–2 orders of magnitude) effect of the analogous mutation in NBF2 (Lys1250) on open burst duration. Furthermore, the large effect of mutations in the corresponding invariant “P-loop” lysines on the hydrolysis rate of other GTPases and ATPases (35Sung P. Higgins D. Prakesh L. Prakesh S. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3263-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 36Hsieh S. Julin D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5647-5653Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 37Schneider E. Wilken S. Schmid R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20456-20461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicates that the hydrolysis rate of Lys464 mutants is likely to be very low. This discrepancy between the predicted hydrolysis rate and the effect on channel gating led us to propose that ATP hydrolysis at NBF1, while essential for CFTR activity, is not directly coupled to the initiation of each open burst (15Gunderson K.L. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 231-239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). This model is strengthened by the observation in this paper that the kinetics of channel opening are unaffected by replacement of Mg2+ ATP with Ca2+ATP, even while the closing rate is greatly reduced.Our data also suggest that CFTR gating can be modulated by changes in the oxidation state of sulfhydryl residues. Reducing conditions accelerate both the opening rate of the channel (causing more frequent openings) and the closing rate of the channel (resulting in very short openings), whereas oxidizing conditions or treatment with “soft” divalent cations reverses these effects. The more frequent channel opening events in reducing conditions increased average channel Po in both cell-attached and excised patches despite the shorter length of the openings. In contrast, in oxidizing conditions, channels open into bursts that can last for minutes at a time, indicating that the closing rate of CFTR channels is significantly slower than in reduced conditions. In addition, oxidized channels also have a slower opening rate compared with reduced conditions, so that the closed times are dramatically lengthened. The fact that in freshly excised patches, channel gating behavior falls largely in the middle of the oxidized and reduced modes of gating probably reflects the heterogeneity of the channel in patches when the redox state is not controlled.It is possible that the treatment with sulfhydryl-specific drugs alters CFTR gating not through a direct effect on the channel but through the action of some other modulating protein such as a kinase or phosphatase. However, the activating effects of reducing agents are probably not due to increased phosphorylation because they occurred even in the absence of added kinase and in the presence of the PKA inhibitory peptide PKI. Although it is conceivable that an endogenous kinase other than PKA may be involved, increased phosphorylation as would be expected under reducing conditions has been shown to lengthen the duration of channel openings rather than shortening them (20Jia Y. Mathews C.J. Hanrahan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4978-4984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 38Fischer H. Machen T.E. J. Gen Phys. 1994; 104: 541-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Similarly, if oxidizing conditions simply reduced the level of phosphorylation of channels, then one would expect to see only a reduction in channel opening events not the changes in burst kinetics that we observed. Moreover, CFTR channels fused into lipid bilayers showed the same alterations in gating kinetics in the presence of oxidizing and reducing agents as channels in inside-out patches, indicating that the effects of redox are not dependent on the particular proteins present in excised patches.Our data support a model in which modification of sulfhydryl residues alters the hydrolysis rate of ATP at one or both NBFs with reducing conditions favoring faster hydrolysis and oxidizing agents decreasing the rate of ATP hydrolysis. This hypothesis is supported by our finding that reducing agents are unable to shorten the long open bursts caused by nonhydrolyzable analogs. Apparently, when the ATP hydrolysis rate is “locked” at a low rate, reducing agents are unable to alter channel gating.Could changes in open burst duration through regulation of the redox state of the channel be a way for cells to control the open probability of CFTR? In cell-attached patches we observe the same range of long and short burst durations as in excised patches, and others have observed similarly long open bursts in cell-attached patches (18Haws C. Finkbeiner W.E. Widdicombe J.H. Wine J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: L502-L512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Hwang T.-C. Wang F. Yang I.C.-H. Reenstra W.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C988-C998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, we observed a decrease in long open bursts in cell-attached patches when cells were treated with β-ME, raising the possibility that channels in the plasma membrane may not be in a uniformly reduced state. There have been reports of other membrane proteins in which intracellular cysteines appear to be oxidized at the plasma membrane. Formation and breakage of an intracellular disulfide bond has been proposed as a mechanism for regulation of the coated vesicle vacuolar H+-ATPase as it cycles from the plasma membrane to clathrin-coated vesicles and back to the plasma membrane (40Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13224-13230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the typically reducing environment of the cell, it is possible for intracellular cysteines to be oxidized, either through the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond or formation of a mixed disulfide with a redox-buffering peptide such as glutathione. Redox potential in cells is maintained largely by glutathione, which exists in the cytoplasm in both oxidized and reduced forms. Although the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione in the cytoplasm is on the order of 20:1 (28Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar), conditions at the plasma membrane may be significantly more oxidizing than the bulk cytoplasm (41Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 203-216PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the ability of a pair of cysteine residues to form a disulfide bond is determined by their oxidation potential, so that residues with a high oxidation potential can form disulfide bonds even in a reducing environment (40Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13224-13230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that large concentrations of reducing agents are required to affect CFTR channel gating indicates that the sulfhydryls being reduced have a very high redox potential and could potentially be oxidized at physiological concentrations of reduced glutathione. In addition, the ratio of oxidized to reduced forms of biological thiols is very sensitive to intracellular redox potential, and small changes can lead to significant alterations in the ratio of oxidized to reduced forms (42Keire D.A. Strauss E. Guo W. Noszal B. Rabenstein D.L. J. Organic Chem. 1992; 57: 123-127Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar).Oxidizing pressure in the cell can come from oxygen free radicals (43Stadtman E.R. Oliver C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2005-2008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or NO+, a byproduct of intracellular nitric oxide production (29Stamler J.S. Cell. 1994; 78: 931-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar). NO+ can interact with thiol groups of cysteine residues to form S-nitrosothiols. These nitrosothiol groups can then be transferred between and among proteins or glutathione molecules tremendously extending the lifetime of NO-mediated effects on intracellular proteins (44Arnelle D.A. Stamler J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). NO+-mediated oxidation of sulfhydryl groups on intracellular cysteine residues has been implicated in the regulation of a number of proteins including olfactory cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (45Broillet M.-C. Firestein S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 377-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), l-type calcium channels (46Campbell D.L. Stamler J.S. Strauss H.C. J. Gen.

Epithelial cells of the type that express CFTR have the enzyme nitric oxide synthetase and can produce quantities of nitric oxide, particularly in the lung (50Rengasamy A. Xue C. Johns R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: L704-L711PubMed Google Scholar, 51Asano K. Chee C.B.E. Gaston B. Lilly C.M. Gerard C. Drazen J.M. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Therefore, it is possible that redox modulation through the production of intracellular nitric oxide may play a role in regulation of CFTRin vivo. Our experiments with the NO donor SNAP support this possibility by demonstrating that cysteine residues in CFTR can be oxidized by exposure to NO+ and nitrosothiols.The effects of redox state that we have described may shed some light on the variable behavior of CFTR channels in different laboratories and in different preparations. Redox potential is rarely controlled in patch clamp experiments, and so conditions are likely to be mostly oxidizing. In contrast, preparation of microsomes for fusion of channels into bilayers is frequently done under reducing conditions that would reverse any cellular oxidative changes and might result in a channel with quite different gating characteristics. As a further complication, protein kinase subunits added to increase channel activity are frequently kept in an active state by storage in as much as 50 mm of a reducing agent such as DTT, so that the addition of the kinase to patches or bilayers may affect more than the phosphorylation state of the channel. Taken together, our data demonstrate that changes in the oxidation state of CFTR affect both the opening and the closing rate of the channel and indicate that these changes may have some physiological relevance to the cellular regulation of channel activity. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)1 belongs to the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette transporters, members of which are characterized structurally by two ATP-binding motifs and functionally by their ability to couple ATP hydrolysis to transport of a substrate molecule across a membrane (1Ames G.F.-L.

In this study, we have examined the regulatory pathways for prostaglandin E2(PGE2) production during protein kinase C-dependent activation of human WISH cells. In these cells, PGE2 synthesis appears to be limited not by free arachidonic acid availability but by the expression levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Concomitant with the cells being able to synthesize and secrete PGE2, we detected significant elevations of both COX-2 protein and mRNA levels. Specific inhibition of COX-2 by NS-398 totally ablated PGE2synthesis. All of these responses were found to be strikingly dependent on an active phosphatidate phosphohydrolase 1 (PAP-1). Inhibition of PAP-1 activity by three different strategies (i.e. use of bromoenol lactone, propranolol, and ethanol) resulted in inhibition of COX-2 expression and hence of PGE2 production.

The prevention of premature birth is a goal not yet attained because of the lack of knowledge about basic mechanisms responsible for premature labor and delivery. Term and preterm labor are thought to share a common terminal pathway composed of uterine contractility, cervical dilation, and rupture of membranes. However the steps leading to these processes may be different. Whereas term labor results from physiological activation of the components of the common terminal pathway, preterm labor appears likely to be the result of a disease process that activates this common terminal pathway early (1Romero R.

Also, recent evidence using COX-2 knockout mice show that the products of the cyclooxygenase pathway are required for every step of early pregnancy, including ovulation, fertilization, implantation and decidualization (12Majerus P.W. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R87-R89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The detailed ways that they act remain to be determined. In this study, we have examined the expression and activity of the COX isoenzymes during activation of the human amnionic cell line WISH. Previously (13Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7684-7690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we identified a novel pathway for AA mobilization in human amnionic WISH cells involving the participation of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase 1 (PAP-1) as a key regulatory element. We now demonstrate that PAP-1 is also implicated in the signaling cascade leading to induction of COX-2 in activated WISH cells. Therefore PAP-1 emerges as a novel key regulatory component of the eicosanoid response of amnion cells. Human WISH cells (established amnion cell line) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (endotoxin <0.05 ng/ml) was from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD). Fetal bovine serum was from Hyclone Labs (Logan, UT). Trypsin/EDTA solution was purchased from Irvine Scientific (Santa Ana, CA). [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-3H]Arachidonic acid (specific activity 100 Ci/mmol) and [32P]CTP (specific activity 6,000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was from Calbiochem. Arachidonic acid was from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Bromoenol lactone (BEL) was from either Biomol or Calbiochem. The secretory PLA2 inhibitor LY311727 was kindly provided by Dr. Edward Mihelich (Lilly Research Laboratories). Methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate (MAFP), aspirin, NS-398, indomethacin, COX-1 polyclonal antiserum, and COX-2 polyclonal antibody were from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Casein solution (10×), streptavidin horseradish peroxidase, and biotinylated goat anti-rabbit F(ab′)2 fragments were from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Propranolol and thimerosal were from Sigma. ExpressHyb hybridization solution was from CLONTECH(Palo Alto, CA). The 1.8-kilobase pair cDNA fragment encoding human COX-2 was a gift kindly provided by Dr. Timothy Hla (Dept. of Physiology, University of Connecticut). The β-actin probe used as a control in the Northern analysis was from Ambion (Austin, TX). Human amnionic WISH cells (14Hayflick L. Exp. Cell Res. 1961; 23: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) were maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 90% air and 10% CO2. The cells were subcultured twice weekly by trypsinization and, when used for experiments, were seeded into 12-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well, Corning Inc.) or 6-well plates (3.7 × 105 cells/well, NUNC). After a 2-day growth, the cells, at 90% confluence, were rinsed with serum-free medium and incubated for 1 h before stimulation. Cells were radiolabeled with [3H]AA by including 0.5 μCi [3H]AA/106 cells in the culture medium 20 h before stimulation. Unincorporated [3H]AA was removed by washing the cells three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (fatty acid-free). Cells were stimulated with 25 ng/ml PMA for different time periods in the presence of 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The supernatants were removed and cleared of detached cells by centrifugation, and radioactivity was counted by liquid scintillation. When inhibitors were used, except for ethanol, they were added to the cells 20 min before PMA was added to the medium. When ethanol was used as an inhibitor it was added to the cells just before the addition of PMA. Cells were stimulated with 25 ng/ml PMA for different time periods in serum-free medium. The supernatants were removed and cleared of detached cells by centrifugation, and PGE2 was quantitated using a specific radioimmunoassay (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). When inhibitors were used, except for ethanol, they were added to the cells 20 min before PMA was added to the medium. When ethanol was used as an inhibitor it was added to the cells just before the addition of PMA. PAP activity in homogenates from WISH cells were assayed exactly as described previously (16Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31937-31941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The substrate [14C]glycerol-labeled PA was presented as mixed micelles with Triton X-100 at a detergent/phospholipid mole ratio of 10:1. Assays were conducted at 37 °C. The incubation mixture contained in a final volume of 0.1 ml: 100 μm [14C]PA substrate (0.025 μCi/assay), 1 mm Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.1), 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and the indicated amount of homogenate protein. After the indicated times the reaction was stopped and [14C]PA and [14C]diacylglycerol were separated by thin layer chromatography using the systemn-hexane/ethyl ether/acetic acid (70:30:1). Total PAP activity in the homogenates arises from two separate enzymes: PAP-1 and PAP-2. To establish the relative contribution of each of these isoenzyme to total WISH cell PAP activity, experiments were carried out in the presence of 8 mm N-ethylmaleimide, an agent that completely blocks PAP-1 activity but has no effect on PAP-2 (16Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31937-31941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). By this procedure we determined that PAP-1 accounts for ∼20% of total PAP activity in WISH cell homogenates. All assays were conducted under conditions of linearity with respect to time and protein concentration, and showed zero-order kinetics for the concentration of substrate used. The cells were lysed using phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. Samples (50 μg) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% acrylamide gel) and transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 2.5% casein in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 154 mm NaCl, and 0.2 mm thimerosal. The blocking solution was then removed, and the membranes were incubated with anti-COX antibody (1:1,000 dilution) in blot buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 1% casein, pH 7.5) overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were then washed in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 (50 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.05% Tween 20) three times for 5 min. The membranes were then incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit F(ab′)2fragments (1:2,000 dilution) in blot buffer for 30 min at room temperature and then washed (3 washes, 5 min each) in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20. The membranes were then incubated with streptavidin horseradish peroxidase (1:5,000 dilution) in blot buffer for 30 min at room temperature and washed (3 washes, 5 min each) in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20. The bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total cellular RNA was isolated from unstimulated or PMA-stimulated cells by the TRIZOL reagent method (Life Technologies, Inc.), exactly as indicated by the manufacturer. Fifteen μg of total RNA per lane was electrophoresed in a 1% formaldehyde/agarose gel and transferred to nylon-supported membranes (Hybond, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 10× SSC buffer. After UV cross-linking, the membranes were hybridized in ExpressHyb hybridization solution according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA probes were labeled using Ready-to-Go DNA labeling beads from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech according to the manufacturer's protocol.32P-labeled probes for COX-2 and β-actin were incubated with the filters for 1 h at 68 °C. When incubated with the COX-2 probe, the membranes were washed once for 30 min in 0.2× SSC containing 0.5% SDS at 68 °C, followed by two washes with 0.1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 68 °C. When incubated with the β-actin probe, the membranes were washed twice with 0.1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 68 °C. Bands were visualized by autoradiography. Assays were carried out in duplicate or triplicate. Each set of experiments was repeated at least three times with similar results. Unless otherwise indicated, the data presented are from representative experiments. Previous experiments in our laboratory established that PMA induces AA release in WISH cells in a time-dependent manner with the maximal response being reached almost 90 min after cell stimulation (13Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7684-7690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, PMA-stimulated WISH cells also produced measurable amounts of PGE2, albeit with a distinct time dependence. Stimulated PGE2 was barely detectable within the first 2 h of stimulation, increasing substantially afterward. The lack of a correlation between the time courses of AA release and PGE2production in PMA-stimulated WISH cells (e.g. Fig. 1 and Fig. 1A in Ref. 13Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7684-7690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) suggests that free AA availability is not rate-limiting for PGE2 biosynthesis in this cell line. The above notion directed us to the study of the expression and activity of the AA-metabolizing enzymes COX-1 and COX-2. Immunoblot analysis of the COX isoforms expressed by the WISH cells revealed that COX-2, but not COX-1, increased after PMA treatment in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (Fig.2). Maximal COX-2 expression was observed at 4–6 h, which corresponds well with the kinetics of PMA-induced PGE2 production shown above. The increases in COX-2 protein were confirmed by analyzing mRNA levels for both COX-1 and COX-2. As shown in Fig. 3, COX-2 mRNA levels substantially increased after PMA treatment; whereas, COX-1 mRNA levels did not change (data not shown). Fig.4 shows that the COX-2 specific inhibitor NS-398 abolished the production of PGE2 in response to PMA. Collectively these data suggest that the increased capacity of the WISH cells to produce PGE2 in response to PMA is due to the increased expression of COX-2 protein.Figure 3Time-course of COX-2 mRNA production in cells stimulated with 25 ng/ml PMA for the time indicated (h) as assessed by Northern blot.

PGE2 release was measured in unstimulated cells (Control) or cells stimulated with 25 ng/ml PMA, in the absence (open bars) or presence (closed bars) of NS-398 (5 μm). NS-398 was added 20 min before the addition of PMA. The cells were then incubated for 10 h. PGE2 in the supernatants was measured using a specific radioimmunoassay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The effect of BEL on PMA-induced COX-2 protein is shown in Fig.5 A. BEL is generally regarded as a Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2(iPLA2) inhibitor (15Hazen S.L. Zupan L.A. Weiss R.H. Getman D.P. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7227-7232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but recent studies have demonstrated that it affects another cellular phospholipase, namely PAP-1 (16Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31937-31941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). We show in Fig. 6 that BEL directly inhibits WISH cell PAP-1 activity. Importantly, the effects of BEL on COX-2 expression shown in Fig. 5 A are clearly not due to iPLA2 inhibition, because MAFP, a dual cytosolic PLA2/iPLA2 inhibitor (17Lio Y. Reynolds L.J. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) did not reproduce the effect. In agreement with the above data, BEL also inhibited the PMA-induced COX-2 mRNA levels (Fig. 5 B). In perfect agreement with the data of Fig. 5, BEL strongly inhibited the PMA-stimulated PGE2 production (Fig.7).Figure 6PAP activity in WISH cell homogenates.WISH cell homogenates were incubated with 25 μm BEL, 100 μm propranolol or neither (Ctrl) for 10 min before assaying PAP activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 7PGE2 release in the presence of PAP inhibitors. PGE2 release was measured in cells incubated in the absence (open bars) or presence (closed bars) of 25 ng/ml PMA, and, where indicated, in the presence of BEL (25 μm), ethanol (EtOH, 2%), propranolol (Propr, 100 μm). The cells were then incubated for 6 h. Afterward, PGE2 in the supernatants was determined with a specific radioimmunoassay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further establish that the effects of BEL on COX-2 expression and attendant PGE2 production are actually due to inhibition of PAP-1, we used two other independent strategies to achieve inhibition of the enzyme. In the first place we used propranolol, a well established PAP-1 inhibitor (18Suchard S.J. Nakamura T. Abe A. Shayman J.A. Boxer L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8063-8068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that is both structurally and mechanistically unrelated to BEL. Propranolol also completely inhibited WISH cell PAP-1 activity (Fig. 6), PGE2 production (Fig.7), and the induction of COX-2 protein (Fig.8 A) and mRNA (Fig.8 B). As a third approach, we used ethanol. By forming phosphatidylethanol instead of phosphatidic acid by phospholipase D, this alcohol depletes the substrate for PAP-1, therefore blunting the action of the enzyme. The overall effect is thus the same as if PAP-1 was being directly inhibited. Ethanol totally blocked PGE2 release (Fig. 7) and dramatically decreased the levels of both COX-2 protein (Fig.9 A) and mRNA (Fig.9 B). Collectively, these data do suggest the involvement of PAP-1 as an upstream component of the signaling cascade triggered by PMA that leads to enhanced COX-2 expression and attendant PGE2 release. Our previous studies with the human amnionic cell line WISH have demonstrated that acute stimulation of these cells with PMA leads to increased AA release in a short phase that plateaus at about 2 h. We have now extended these previous experiments to PGE2production. Unexpectedly, our results reveal that PGE2 is much more delayed in time. Appreciable PGE2 is observed only after 2 h of incubation with the phorbol ester and proceeds continuously for at least 10 h. Given that free AA is the precursor of prostaglandins, this discrepancy between the time courses of both AA and PGE2 generation suggests that the production of the latter is not limited by availability of the former. Thus, expression and activity of COX-2 protein would appear to be the most plausible candidate for limiting PGE2 biosynthesis in WISH cells once AA release is activated. In accord with this, PMA was found to induce a dose- and time-dependent increase in the expression of COX-2 mRNA and protein, which corresponds very well with the production of PGE2 by these cells. Moreover, PMA-stimulated PGE2 production by WISH cells is abolished by the specific COX-2 inhibitor NS-398. On the other hand, immunoblot analysis demonstrates that COX-1 is constitutively expressed and remains unchanged in WISH cells activated with PMA. Thus, this study supports a key role for COX-2 in PG biosynthesis during parturition, which is in accord with data by others in amnion cells under different experimental settings (4Lundgren D.W.

Kniss D.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 677-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, information is still scarce as to the signaling mechanisms involved in COX-2 protein up-regulation under stimulation conditions. Recently, we unveiled a novel signaling mechanism operating in activated WISH cells (13Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7684-7690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). According to this mechanism, acute protein kinase Cα activation results in the sequential activation of phospholipase D, phosphatidate phosphohydrolase, and finally cytosolic Group IV PLA2 (13Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7684-7690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The message delivered by this pathway is the early (2 h) mobilization of free AA. As indicated above, free AA is not immediately used for PG synthesis, which suggests the possibility that at short times it may serve a signaling role. Thus we initially considered the possibility of whether this early burst of free AA was somehow involved in the delayed up-regulation of COX-2. Several lines of evidence suggest however that this may not be the case. Treatment of the cells with MAFP, which inhibits the cytosolic PLA2 and hence AA mobilization (13Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7684-7690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), does not alter COX-2 message or protein levels. In addition, we have noted that incubating the cells with micromolar quantities of free AA does not increase COX-2 mRNA or protein levels (data not shown). Thus, if the early burst of free AA release produced in WISH cells actually serves a signaling role, it is unrelated to COX-2 up-regulation. In our AA release experiments, we use bovine serum albumin in the incubation medium to prevent cellular re-utilization of the fatty acid. Thus the bulk of the AA released accumulates in the extracellular medium (13Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7684-7690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, in the absence of albumin, conditions under which prostaglandin production is measured, most of the liberated fatty acid is re-acylated back into phospholipids, meaning that it would not be used for prostaglandin production. This suggests that delayed PG production is primarily determined by the expression levels of COX-2 and not by the increased availability of fatty acid precursor, which is the prevailing limiting step in the short term (minutes) PG production of most cell types (23Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Atsumi G. Inoue K. Kudo I. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 17: 225-283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the induction of both COX-2 protein and mRNA was strongly blunted by BEL. This compound has recently been shown to inhibit both the Group VI iPLA2 and Mg2+-dependent PAP-1 with similar potencies (16Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31937-31941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). MAFP, another compound that inhibits iPLA2 (17Lio Y. Reynolds L.J. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), did not have any effect on COX, thus suggesting that PAP-1 is the enzyme whose blockage leads to inhibition of COX-2 expression. In accordance with this view, inhibition of PAP-1 by two other unrelated strategies, namely direct inhibition of the enzyme by propranolol and PAP substrate depletion by ethanol, gave the same inhibitory effect on COX-2 expression. Collectively, these results strongly implicate PAP-1 as an upstream component of the PMA-triggered sequence of events that culminate in COX-2 protein expression and hence, increased PGE2 production. This is a very interesting concept because our previous studies (13Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7684-7690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) have unveiled the crucial role that PAP-1 plays in the short term PMA signaling that leads to cytosolic PLA2 activation and attendant AA release. Thus the results of our studies suggest that PAP-1 is a central enzyme in protein kinase C-dependent AA metabolism in amnionic cells by regulating the two major enzymes involved in the response. On one hand, PAP-1 channels the short term signals originating from protein kinase C stimulation to cytosolic PLA2 activation and AA mobilization (13Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7684-7690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). On the other hand, PAP-1 appears to be a key component of the sequence of mechanisms that trigger long term COX-2 induction and PGE2 production (this study). Unlike its Mg2+-independent counterpart, PAP-2, PAP-1 had traditionally been thought to be primarily involved in the regulation of glycerolipid synthesis (24Brindley D.N. Waggoner D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24281-24284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In addition to that role, this study adds to the increasingly attractive notion (25Jiang Y. Lu Z. Zang Q. Foster D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29529-29532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) that PAP-1 does indeed serve a signaling role in cells. Ongoing studies in our laboratory are attempting to elucidate other components of the PAP-1-regulated pathway leading to activation of the COX-2 gene.

The amino acid sequence of CLN2 gave a significant match with those of PCP and XCP. The transcript of CLN2 mRNA was widely distributed in human tissues. This paper was the first example showing indirectly that a pepstatin-insensitive carboxyl proteinase exists in mammal tissues. Of pepstatin-insensitive carboxyl proteinases, Pseudomonas sp. 101 carboxyl proteinase (PCP) 1The abbreviations used are:PCPPseudomonas sp. 101 carboxyl proteinaseXCPXanthomonas sp.

These enzymes were not inactivated by acetyl pepstatin, diazoacetyl-dl-norleucine methyl ester, and 1,2-epoxy-3-(p-nitrophenoxy)propane but were inhibited by tyrostatin (N-isovaleryl-tyrosyl-leusyl-tyrosinal) (29Oda K.

The zymogens were converted to mature enzymes through autoproteolytic activations under acidic pH conditions. The COOH-terminal pro-region of XCP (192 amino acid residues) was not essential for the forming of active mature XCP (31Oda K. Ito M. Uchida K. Shibano Y. Fukuhara K. Takahashi S. J. Biochem.

The primary structures of PCP and XCP showed no homology to pepstatin-sensitive carboxyl proteinases (aspartic proteinase) reported so far, whereas approximately 52% identity (65% similarity) existed between PCP and XCP (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the conserved catalytic residues (-Asp*-Thr-Gly-) for aspartic proteinases did not exist in both enzymes. Pseudomonas sp. 101 carboxyl proteinase Xanthomonas sp.

Recently, we have shown that Asp140 and Glu222 residues of PCP were involved in the catalytic function, probably as substrate binding sites by differential labeling using N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and tyrostatin (36Ito M. Narutaki S. Uchida K. Oda K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1999; 125: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Catalytic residues of PCP and XCP have not yet been identified. To identify the catalytic residues of PCP and XCP, we took a molecular biological approach based on their high sequence similarities. This paper describes the construction and expression of plasmids for mutant PCPs and XCPs and the identification of catalytic residues based on their autocatalytic maturations and enzyme activities.

For E217A, after treatment with ammonium sulfate, the enzyme solution was dialyzed against 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH6.5 (buffer C) overnight. The dialysate was loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column (1.5 × 15 cm) equilibrated with buffer C, and active fractions were eluted with a linear gradient of sodium chloride from 0 to 0.5 m. Expression in E. coli JM109 was carried out by the method described above except for the activation. After sonication, the supernatant was diluted 6-fold with 60 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.7, containing 12 mm CaCl2 and then incubated at 37 °C for 5 h. The enzyme solution was fractionated with ammonium sulfate at 80% saturation. After standing at 4 °C overnight, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation (20,000 × g, 20 min) and dialyzed against buffer B. The dialysate was loaded onto a column of DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B (1.5×15 cm) equilibrated previously with buffer B. Recombinant XCP was eluted with a linear gradient of sodium chloride from 0 to 1 m.

As part of an ongoing study of catalases, HPII mutant variants with changes in Val169, Asp197, His392, His395, Ser414, and Gln419 were produced. The HPII variant V169C, designed to investigate the effect of changes in the major channel leading to the active site, was found to contain an unusual covalent bond between the essential histidine (His128) and the substituted residue (Cys169). Variants in other positions were produced to study the mechanism of heme oxidation and Tyr-His bond formation in HPII. In particular, a variant of His392 was designed to change the residue to its Gln (14Kozlov E.A. Levitina T.L. Bobrovskaia M.T. Gudkova L.V. Latyshko N.V. Radomskii N.F. Bioorg.

Jensen P.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 139: 171-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) in a Gilson oxygraph equipped with a Clark electrode. One unit of catalase is defined as the amount that decomposes 1 μmol of H2O2 in 1 min in a 60 mmH2O2 solution at pH 7.0 at 37 °C. Protein was estimated according to the methods outlined by Layne (23Layne E. Methods Enzymol. 1957; 3: 447-454Crossref Scopus (2718) Google Scholar). 250 μg of protein was boiled for 3 min in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and mixed with 7 μg of trypsin at room temperature for 1 h. The solution was boiled a second time and treated with an additional 7 μg of trypsin for 1 h after which the solution was boiled and lyophilized. The dried sample was dissolved in 2 ml of saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (1:2 by volume). 1 μl was applied to the sample probe and air dried for MALDI-MS using the Manitoba reflecting time-of-flight mass spectrometer (24Ens W. Spicer V. Standing K.G. Zhou J. Org. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 28: 1430-1434Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The instrument was operated in positive-ion linear mode. Desorption/ionization was achieved by a pulsed ultraviolet laser beam (N2 laser, λ = 337 nm). The acceleration voltage was 20 kV and the laser power density was approximately 106W/cm2. The mass spectrum of each sample was the average of more than 100 shots. For mass calibration, bovine insulin (5733 Da) was used. Crystals of HPII variants V169C and H392Q were obtained in the vicinity of the conditions previously described for the wild type enzyme HPII (3Bravo J. Verdaguer N. Tormo J. Betzel C. Switala J. Loewen P.C. Fita I. Structure. 1995; 3: 491-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A diffraction data set for the V169C variant was collected at station X11 in DESY. The crystal was frozen in liquid nitrogen with 30% MPD added to the crystallization buffer. Diffraction data were processed with DENZO and scaled with SCALEPACK (25Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38252) Google Scholar) (TableII). For the H392Q variant, data were collected using a rotating anode x-ray source and graphite monochromator at 100 K in the same cryobuffer. Data were processed and scaled using MOSFLM (26Leslie A.G.W. Moras D. Podjanry A.D. Thierry J.C. Crystallographic Computing V. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1991: 27-38Google Scholar) and SCALA (27Evans P.R.

TheR free criteria was used during all the refinement but no reflections were omitted in the map Fourier synthesis calculations. A distance restraint and the removal of the non-bonded interactions between atoms participating in the new His-Cys bond were used during the final steps of the V169C refinement. Restraints due to the non-crystallographic symmetry were only taken into account in the initial steps of refinement to 2.5-Å resolution. Bulk solvent correction was included and the whole resolution was used in the refinement. The corresponding final crystallographic agreement factors,R and R free, together with other refinement parameters are summarized in Table II. Solvent accessibility and cavities were calculated with VOIDOO (32Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). For polar atoms the atomic radii used were smaller than the van der Waals value (33Williams M.A. Goodfellow J.M. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1224-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). This allows us to take into account the fact that when two atoms form a hydrogen bond, the observed interatomic distance is smaller than the sum of the atomic radii. Atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited with Protein Data Bank with entry codes 1qf7 and1cf9 for the H392Q and V169C variants of HPII, respectively.Table IIData collection and structural refinement statisticsV169CH392QA.

Open table in a new tab The side chain of Val169 is situated immediately above the essential residue His128 where the major access channel enters the distal heme pocket (Fig. 1 A). This valine is fully preserved among all known catalase sequences and it is placed in the narrowest and most hydrophobic section of the channel. Changing the equivalent residue in catalase A from S. cerevisiae to a smaller residue (V111A) resulted in an enzyme with reduced catalatic activity but enhanced peroxidatic activity for larger substrates (34Zamocky M. Herzog C. Nykyri L.M. Koller F. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This was attributed to a disruption in the flow of H2O2 in the enlarged channel and to easier access for the larger peroxidatic substrates. The rationale behind changing Val169 → Cys in HPII was that subsequent selective reaction of the sulfhydryl group might allow progressive blockage of the access channel. This objective was precluded by the finding that the purified V169C mutant had only about 0.1% of the native HPII activity, and contained heme b as determined by HPLC and spectral analyses (Table III). In order to define if these dramatic and unexpected changes were a result of steric factors or another property specific to the cysteine residue, the V169A and V169S mutant variants were constructed. These two variant enzymes contained heme d and exhibited about 25% of wild type activity, similar to the change in activities of the equivalent Val mutants in catalase A from S. cerevisiae and significantly higher than the activity of the V169C variant. Noo-dianisidine peroxidatic activity was detected. From this, it was concluded that the Cys residue was a determining factor in the reduced catalatic activity and in the lack of conversion of heme b to heme d. How a residue located outside the heme pocket could have such important catalytic effects remained puzzling and structure determination of the V169C variant was considered appropriate.Table IIICharacterization of the HPII mutant variantsMutationSpecific activityHemeaHeme composition was determined by spectral and HPLC analyses.

Open table in a new tab The three-dimensional structure of the V169C variant of HPII was determined and refined using synchrotron data at 1.8-Å resolution. The starting model was the structure of native HPII at 1.9-Å resolution (4Bravo J. Maté M.J. Schneider T. Switala J. Wilson K. Fita I. Loewen P.C. Proteins. 1999; 34: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), from which the substituted residue and neighboring solvent molecules were omitted. The final refined V169C structure, with crystallographic agreement factors of r = 18.1% andR free = 23.7%, provided a clean electron density map which showed a number of significant differences with respect to wild type HPII (Fig. 1, A and B). All of these differences were clustered in the vicinity of either the mutated residue or the heme group. The most striking feature evident in the final electron density maps of the V169C variant is the presence of a covalent bond between the sulfur atom of Cys169 and the imidazole ring of His128(Fig. 1 B and Fig. 2). The shape of the electron density and the refinement behavior strongly suggest that, within the limitations of the resolution available, the sulfur atom from Cys169 together with all the atoms from the imidazole ring of His128 are in a common plane. Perfect planarity implies that the atoms in the imidazole ring retain thesp 2 hybridization state which imposes strong constraints on the possible chemical mechanisms that can produce the covalent bond. The modified imidazole ring is rotated about 30o relative to its position in wild type HPII and its orientation can be unambiguously defined by the proximity of a water molecule within 3.1 Å of the imidazole Nε atom and by the bifurcated hydrogen bond formed by Nδ with both Oγ from Ser167 and main chain carbonyl oxygen from Thr168 (Fig. 2). This leaves the Cε of the imidazole ring situated just 1.84 Å from the cysteine sulfur atom, a distance consistent with a covalent bond. The rigidity introduced by the new Cys-His covalent bond that would likely raise the pK a of the imidazole ring together with the altered imidazole-heme stacking, should both contribute to the diminished catalytic activity of the V169C variant. The moderate increase in the heme channel volume that results from the Val to Cys replacement can only explain in part the presence of four extra solvent molecules in the variant enzyme (Figs. 1, Band D, and 2). These solvent molecules form a continuous hydrogen bonded chain that extends the full-length of the channel from the molecular surface to the distal pocket, ending with the water molecule above the heme iron. The presence of this continuous chain of solvent molecules reaching the active center proves that the low activity of this mutant is not a result of steric hindrance to substrate access. In native HPII, the solvent chain is interrupted in the vicinity of Val-169. The V169C variant crystal structure confirmed the presence of heme b, rather than heme d as had already been suggested by HPLC analysis, and also confirmed the mass spectroscopic analyses that showed the absence of the Tyr415-His392 covalent bond found in wild type HPII. The absence of the two covalent modifications in the V169C variant is similar to the situation found in the structure of the inactive or weakly active variants, H128A, H128N, and N201H (Fig.3) (12Bravo J. Fita I. Gouet P. Jouve H.M. Melik-Adamyan W. Murshudov G.N. Scandalios J.G. Oxidative Stress and the Molecular Biology of Antioxidant Defenses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 407-445Google Scholar). 2J. Bravo, J. Switala, P. C. Loewen, and I. Fita, unpublished results. In these structures, Gln419 is rotated forming a hydrogen bond with the heme propionate side chain and with a water molecule located near Thr416. Furthermore, the main chain from residues 414 to 417 is shifted with respect to the native model, and Ile126, on the heme distal side, exists in two conformations likely due to the restrictions imposed by its proximity to the propionate chain (Fig. 3). An independent confirmation of the presence of the His128-Cys169 covalent bond was provided by a mass analysis, using MALDI-MS, of trypsin digests of wild type HPII and of the V169C variant. Complete digestion of HPII by trypsin should generate a mixture of 75 peptide products, which will be further complicated, particularly below 3000 Da, by the presence of partial digest products. His128 and Val169 (or Cys169) are situated on separate tryptic peptides (Fig. 4 B). The His128-containing peptide extends from Ile126 to Arg130 and has a predicted mass of 596 Da. The Val169-containing peptide extends from Phe166 to Arg180, and replacement of Val with Cys would increase the predicted mass from 1453 to 1457 Da. Covalent linkage of the His128- and Cys169-containing peptides through the imidazole-sulfur bond would produce a 2051-Da peptide, assuming that 2 hydrogens were lost as part of the covalent bond formation. The mass spectrum of a tryptic digest of wild type HPII (Fig. 4 A) confirms the absence of significant peptide peaks in the 2000 to 2100 Da range. By comparison, the mass spectrum of a tryptic digest of the V169C variant (Fig. 4 B) shows a prominent peak in this range with a mass of 2051, consistent with the presence of the His128-Cys169 covalent linkage. The conversion of heme b to heme d and of the formation of the His392-Tyr415 covalent bond in HPII have been linked in a concerted mechanism that requires the formation of compound I. The proposed mechanism was supported by the observation that neither modification is found in the catalytically inactive variants of HPII, H128A, H128N, and N201H (13Bravo J. Fita I. Ferrer J.C. Ens W. Hillar A. Switala J. Loewen P.C. Protein Sci. 1996; 6: 1016-1023Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar).2 In PVC, the His-Tyr bond cannot be formed because the residue that would correspond to the histidine is a glutamine. However, PVC does form heme d proving that heme oxidation and His-Tyr bond formation can be unlinked and suggesting the possibility that the two reactions may occur separately in HPII. To test this possibility, the HPII mutant variant, H392Q, was constructed to make HPII reflect the structure of PVC, and the H392E, H392A, and H392D variants were constructed for comparison. All of these variants retained activity ranging from 20 to 75% of wild type activity (Table III). Spectroscopic and HPLC analysis revealed that three of the variants, including the Gln, Asp, and Ala replacements, contained only heme b consistent with a coupling of His-Tyr bond formation and heme modification. Despite the activity of the variants, the characteristic heme b spectra were indistinguishable from the spectra for the inactive mutants, H128A, H128N, and N201H previously reported (21Loewen P.C. Switala J. von Ossowski I. Hillar A. Christie A. Tattrie B. Nicholls P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10159-10164Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the H392E variant was found to have a mixture of heme b and heme d (Fig. 5) indicating that heme conversion could occur, albeit at a slower rate. However, the picture is complicated by the presence of large amounts of the trans isomer of the spirolactone in the H392E variant as compared with the predominantly cis isomer in PVC and HPII, and by the presence of an unidentified heme peak that eluted between the peaks of heme d and b. Determination of the crystal structure of the H392Q variant of HPII was undertaken because it differed significantly from wild type HPII in lacking both the His-Tyr bond and heme d despite retaining near wild type activity. The structure, determined and refined following a similar approach to the one described for the V169C variant, gave crystallographic agreement factors r = 14.4% and R free = 21.0% for data at 2.1-Å resolution collected with a conventional rotating anode x-ray source and a graphite monochromator. A number of structural changes with respect to native HPII, including a few rearrangements in the solvent structure and the presence of the heme b group were evident in the electron density (Fig. 1 C). Changes directly related to the presence of heme b, such as the double conformation of Ile126 on the heme distal side and the rotation of Gln419 on the heme proximal side, are consistent with changes already described for the V169C structure (Fig.3). Additional changes around the mutated residue, Gln392, included the hydrogen bonding of Gln419 with both the propionate side chain of the heme group and a molecule of water that is also hydrogen bonded with the amide nitrogen atom of Gln392(Fig. 3). This water, not present in the native HPII structure, is found in PVC and in the HPII variants, V169C and H392Q. Gln419 has the same disposition in the structures of all the HPII variants containing heme b regardless of whether residue 392 is Gln or His (Fig. 3). A water molecule in PVC and in the H392Q variant of HPII occupies the space that corresponds to the imidazole group in the native HPII structure. This water is in direct contact with the Cβatom of the essential tyrosine (Tyr350 in PVC and Tyr415 in HPII) suggesting a strong polarization of"

Li J. Wands J.R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7106-7112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although p120 interacts with this pre-S peptide, it also binds with high affinity to several cleaved pre-S polypeptides (92–161, 98–161, 1–102) (3Li J. Tong S. Wands J.R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6029-6035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); of these, 1–102 may be generated in vivo by cleavage of the large envelope protein present on virion particles by a dibasic endopeptidase. The sequence surrounding pre-S residue 102 (Arg-Glu-Ala-Phe-Arg-Arg-Tyr; residue 102 is underlined) fulfills the requirement for cleavage by furin, which processes many viral envelope protein precursors including human immunodeficiency virus (7Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Thus, depending on the subcellular compartment of endopeptidase cleavage, p120 may serve as a cell surface co-receptor or an intracellular binding partner facilitating the disassembly of viral particles.Further support of the involvement of p120 in the DHBV life cycle is proposed by 1) exclusive expression in the liver, kidney, and pancreas of known DHBV tissues susceptible to infection, contrasting sharply with widespread duck carboxypeptidase D tissue distribution (2Tong S.

Similarly, double-point mutations within the p120 binding site severely hampered viral infection in PDH (3Li J. Tong S. Wands J.R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6029-6035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present investigation, the cDNA of p120 was cloned, and the protein was expressed to characterize its binding properties to pre-S peptides. More important, available protein on the surface of transfected cells was detected.DISCUSSIONThe p120 pre-S-binding protein (2Tong S. Li J. Wands J.R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7106-7112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has now been established as the p protein of DGD following cDNA cloning. The partial amino acid sequences purified from p120 duck liver matched the translated cDNA sequences, and comparison from different species validated p120 as the p protein component of the glycine decarboxylase complex. The tissue distribution of DGD and, specifically, unique patterns of binding to truncated DHBV pre-S and mutants confirmed the identity of DGD as p120.Although the duck p protein is highly homologous to that of the corresponding chicken molecule, there is significant divergence in the N terminus encoding the putative mitochondrial-targeting domain. Interestingly, the DGD protein not only is distributed in the cytoplasm but is also available on the cell surface as described previously (3Li J. Tong S. Wands J.R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6029-6035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and confirmed in the present study (Fig. 7); these DGD findings differ from CGD described as solely a mitochondrial protein. Whether the divergent 5′ sequence is responsible for subcellular and cell surface localization warrants further study.The duck glycine decarboxylase p protein is translated from an AUU codon based on extensive cDNA mutational analysis followed by expression of the mutant constructs in a cell-free system. An in-frame nonsense mutation (Asn2) placed immediately downstream of AUU346 abolished 125-kDa protein production and was similar to a point mutation that converted AUU346 into an AGU codon (Fig. 4, B and C). Moreover, use of the non-AUG codon for initiation also occurred in transfected DGD27/2.3.1 construct in mammalian cells (Fig. 5), indicating that translation from cell lysates was not merely a result of relaxed specificity caused by high potassium concentration. Whether AUU codon selection (compared with other nearby AUG-like codons) requires structural motifsi.e. hairpin structure downstream to slacken the passage of scanning ribosomes, warrants further study.Initiation from an internal AUU codon of the DGD cDNA was apparently not optimal in either reticulocyte lysates or transfected mammalian cells, since conversion of the AUU into the AUG codon and deletion of the 5′-nontranslated region greatly enhanced protein yield. The low efficiency of protein expression is due, in part, to the presence of the nontranslated sequence at the 5′ end, since the DGD27/2.3.1 construct produced a higher yield of protein than DGD24a/2.3.1. Whether such an inhibitory effect is caused by the translation of the upstream small open reading frames or by the presence of a secondary structure impeding the entry of scanning ribosomes remains unknown.Victorin, the toxin produced by the fungus Cochliobolus victoriae, uses the p protein of the oat glycine decarboxylase as the binding protein (16Wolpert T.J. Navarre D.A. Moore D.L. Macko V. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1145-1155PubMed Google Scholar); inhibition of the enzymatic function by victorin is believed to account for the blight of oats (6Navarre D. Wolpert T.J. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 463-471PubMed Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2034101534,"Integrin α7-deficient mice develop a novel form of muscular dystrophy. Here we report that deficiency of α7 integrin causes an activation of the c-Raf-1/mitogen-activated protein (MAP) 2 kinase signal transduction pathway in muscle cells. The observed activation of c-Raf-1/MAP2 kinases is a specific effect, because the α7 integrin deficiency does not cause unspecific stress as determined by measurement of the Hsp72/73 level and activity of the JNK2 kinase. Because an increased level of activated FAK was found in muscle of α7 integrin-deficient mice, the activation of c-Raf-1 kinase is triggered most likely by an integrin-dependent pathway. In accordance with this, in the integrin α7-deficient mice, part of the integrin β1Dvariant in muscle is replaced by the β1A variant, which permits the FAK activation. A recent report describes that integrin activity can be down-modulated by the c-Raf-1/MAP2 kinase pathway. Specific activation of the c-Raf-1/MAP2 kinases by cell-permeable peptides in skeletal muscle of rabbits causes degeneration of muscle fibers. Therefore, we conclude that in α7integrin-deficient mice, the continuous activation of c-Raf-1 kinase causes a permanent reduction of integrin activity diminishing integrin-dependent cell-matrix interactions and thereby contributing to the development of the dystrophic phenotype. Integrin α7-deficient mice develop a novel form of muscular dystrophy. Here we report that deficiency of α7 integrin causes an activation of the c-Raf-1/mitogen-activated protein (MAP) 2 kinase signal transduction pathway in muscle cells. The observed activation of c-Raf-1/MAP2 kinases is a specific effect, because the α7 integrin deficiency does not cause unspecific stress as determined by measurement of the Hsp72/73 level and activity of the JNK2 kinase. Because an increased level of activated FAK was found in muscle of α7 integrin-deficient mice, the activation of c-Raf-1 kinase is triggered most likely by an integrin-dependent pathway. In accordance with this, in the integrin α7-deficient mice, part of the integrin β1Dvariant in muscle is replaced by the β1A variant, which permits the FAK activation. A recent report describes that integrin activity can be down-modulated by the c-Raf-1/MAP2 kinase pathway. Specific activation of the c-Raf-1/MAP2 kinases by cell-permeable peptides in skeletal muscle of rabbits causes degeneration of muscle fibers. Therefore, we conclude that in α7integrin-deficient mice, the continuous activation of c-Raf-1 kinase causes a permanent reduction of integrin activity diminishing integrin-dependent cell-matrix interactions and thereby contributing to the development of the dystrophic phenotype. focal adhesion kinase mitogen-activated protein phosphate-buffered saline Integrins are a family of heterodimeric transmembrane receptors consisting of an α- and a β-subunit (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8966) Google Scholar). Each subunit spans the plasmamembrane once, and in both cases the N termini are localized extracellularly binding the ligand, whereas the C termini face the cytoplasm. Integrins interact with proteins of focal adhesions that mediate the attachment of bundles of stress fibers (2Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Moreover, numerous proteins involved in signal transduction are concentrated in these regions. Therefore integrins do not merely mediate cell attachment to the extracellular matrix but can also promote physiological processes such as migration and cell invasion. On the molecular level, integrin activation can modulate specific gene expression, cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, or prevention of apoptosis. Integrins can be considered as classic receptors without catalytic activity triggering a variety of signal transduction pathways upon ligand binding. In a simplified model, ligand occupation of integrins leads to the activation of the nonreceptor tyrosine focal adhesion kinase (FAK)1 by its autophosphorylation at Tyr-397 (2Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 3Schläpfer D. Broome M. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1702-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). By this tyrosine phosphorylation a binding site (YpAEI motif) for the SH2 domain of protein-tyrosine kinases of the c-Src family is generated. The subsequent Src-dependent phosphorylation at Tyr-576 and Tyr-577 increases the catalytic activity of FAK (4Calalb M. Polte T. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Src-dependent phosphorylation at Tyr-925 (YpENV motif) generates a binding site for the SH2 domain of the adapter protein Grb2. The adapter protein Grb2 consists of a middle SH2 domain known to bind to phosphotyrosine residues and N- and C-terminal SH3 domains (5Lowenstein E.J. Daly R.J. Batzer A.G. Li W. Margolis B. Lammers R. Ullrich A. Skolnick E.Y. Bar-Sagi D. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1992; 70: 431-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar). The SH3 domains of Grb2 are known to interact with SOS proteins (PXXP motif; Ref. 6Yu H. Chen J.K. Feng S. Dalgarno D.C. Brauer A.W. Schreiber S. Cell. 1994; 76: 933-945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar), which modulate Ras activity, finally resulting in an activation of c-Raf-1 kinase.Integrins mediate signals both from the extracellular matrix to the cytoplasm (outside-in signaling) and from the cytoplasm to the outside (inside-out signaling) (for a recent review see Ref. 7Yamada K.M. Matrix Biol. 1997; 16: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Modulation of integrin activity is therefore of major biological significance for a variety of physiological processes like cell migration or differentiation. By the process of inside-out signaling, integrin affinity for its specific ligand is modulated in response to intracellular signals. In a recent report, the Ras/Raf-initiated MAP2 kinase signal transduction pathway was described as a novel transcription-independent modulator of integrin activity (8Hughes P. Renshaw M. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V. Schwartz M. Ginsberg M. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Activated MAP2 kinase down-regulates integrin activity without changing the phosphorylation state of the integrin β-subunit. Because ligand binding to certain integrins can result in a Ras/Raf-dependent activation of MAP2 kinase, this novel pathway most probably represents a negative feedback loop in integrin activity.The α7β1 integrin, a receptor for the basement membrane glycoprotein laminin, is predominantly expressed in muscle (9Song W.K. Wang W. Foster R.F. Bielser D.A. Kaufman S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 643-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 10Bao Z. Lakonishok M. Kaufman S.J. Horwitz A.F. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 579-590PubMed Google Scholar). Mice lacking the α7 integrin subunit develop a novel form of muscular dystrophy (11Mayer U. Saher G. Fässler R. Bornemann A. Echtermeyer F. van der Mark H. Miosge N. Pöschl E. van der Mark K. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 318-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar).Here we describe an activation of the c-Raf-1/MAP2 kinase signal transduction pathway in muscle tissue derived from α7integrin-deficient mice. Specific activation of this pathway in rabbit skeletal muscle is involved in degeneration of muscle fibers. Therefore, permanent activation of this signaling cascade might contribute to the manifestation of the dystrophic phenotype by down-modulation of integrin activity.DISCUSSIONIntegrin α7 deficiency was shown to cause a novel form of muscular dystrophy in mice (11Mayer U. Saher G. Fässler R. Bornemann A. Echtermeyer F. van der Mark H. Miosge N. Pöschl E. van der Mark K. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 318-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). In accordance, patients lacking the integrin α7 subunit develop a myopathy (18Hayashi Y.K. Chou F. Engvall E. Ogawa M. Matsuda C. Hirabayashi S. Yokochi K. Ziober B.L. Kramer R.H. Kaufman S.J. Ozawa E. Goto Y. Nonaka I. Tsukahara T. Wang J. Hoffman E.P. Arahata K. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Integrin α7-deficient mice are viable and fertile, indicating that myogenesis in principle is not affected by loss of α7 integrin. This gives rise to the question of which molecular trigger causes the destruction of the organized muscle architecture, resulting in the dystrophic phenotype.In a recent report it was described that activated Ras/c-Raf-1 pathway is able to down-modulate the activity of β1 or β3 integrins via MAP2 kinase in a transcription-independent manner (8Hughes P. Renshaw M. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V. Schwartz M. Ginsberg M. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Modulation of integrin activity is of major significance for a variety of biological processes as cell migration, which can be considered as an alternation between a high affinity (attachment) and low affinity (detachment) state. Because integrins are known to activate MAP2 kinase by the Ras/Raf mediated cascade, this pathway most probably represents a negative feedback loop controlling integrin activity.In this study we demonstrate that α7 integrin deficiency results in a permanent activation of the c-Raf-1/MAP2 kinase signal transduction pathway in muscle cells. In principle, the observed activation of this signaling cascade could be because of an unspecific secondary effect. However, arguing against an unspecific effect are two observations. First, an activation because of unspecific cellular stress was excluded because both tested markers indicating cellular stress, increased activity of JNK2 and increased amount of Hsp72/73, were not affected by α7 integrin deficiency. Second, the activation of c-Raf-1 and MAP2 kinases in α7integrin-deficient mice is not an age-dependent process, because it was observed at different age stages (between 30 days and 1.5 years; data not shown). The dystrophic phenotype becomes evident in the diaphragm at an age of 2 months (11Mayer U. Saher G. Fässler R. Bornemann A. Echtermeyer F. van der Mark H. Miosge N. Pöschl E. van der Mark K. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 318-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Therefore these data indicate that the activation of c-Raf-1/MAP2 kinase signal transduction pathway by the α7 integrin deficiency can be observed before the phenotype of muscular dystrophy becomes evident. Therefore, it can be excluded that the activation of this signaling cascade is a secondary effect caused by the degenerating/regenerating processes of the muscular dystrophy.In the integrin α7-deficient mice an increased phosphorylation of FAK can be observed, suggesting that the activation of β1 integrins is involved in the activation of c-Raf-1 kinase. In a recent report it was demonstrated that the integrin α7β1 negatively regulates the function of the integrin α5β1 (20Tomatis D. Echtermeyer F. Schober S. Balzac F. Retta S.F. Silengo L. Tarone G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 421-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Therefore, the lack of the α7 subunit could result in an activation of the integrin α5β1, resulting in an activation of FAK.Moreover in the integrin α7-deficient mice a significant change in the composition of the β1 integrin variants occurs. The integrin β1D variant is the only integrin β1 variant that is expressed in the sarcolemma of wild type muscle. In the integrin α7-deficient mice part of the integrin β1D variant is replaced by the integrin β1A variant, resulting in an unaltered amount of β1 integrins. These two variants only differ in their cytoplasmic domains, also affecting their function (21Baudoin C. Van der Flier A. Borradori L. Sonnenberg A. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1996; 4: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 22Belkin A.M. Retta S.F. Pletjushkina O.Y. Balzac F. Silengo L. Fässler R. Koteliansky V.E. Burridge K. Tarone G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1583-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 23Belkin A.M. Zhidkova N. Balzac F. Altruda F. Tomatis D. Maier A. Tarone G. Koteliansky V.E. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 211-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 24Baudoin C. Goumans M. Mummery C. Sonnenberg A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1202-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The integrin β1D variant mediates a tighter binding to the matrix, and its activity cannot be regulated (21Baudoin C. Van der Flier A. Borradori L. Sonnenberg A. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1996; 4: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 23Belkin A.M. Zhidkova N. Balzac F. Altruda F. Tomatis D. Maier A. Tarone G. Koteliansky V.E. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 211-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Therefore, the reduction of the β1D variant could contribute directly to a diminished tissue stability. In contrast, the integrin β1A variant is well known to be involved in dynamic functions, for example the activation of FAK (21Baudoin C. Van der Flier A. Borradori L. Sonnenberg A. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1996; 4: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). An interaction of integrin β1D and FAK has not been found in vivo. That might be due to the fact that the in vivobinding motif for FAK only exists in the integrin β1Avariant (15Dedhar S. Hannigan G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 657-669Crossref Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Under the conditions of a strong overproduction, however, a β1D-dependent activation of FAK in vitro was reported (23Belkin A.M. Zhidkova N. Balzac F. Altruda F. Tomatis D. Maier A. Tarone G. Koteliansky V.E. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 211-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Therefore, in the integrin α7-deficient mice the change in the integrin β1 variant composition in combination with the loss of the integrin α7 negative regulatory effect can be causative for the observed activation of FAK and subsequently of the c-Raf-1/MAP2 kinase signal transduction pathway.As introduced above, activated MAP2 kinase can down-modulate integrin activity (8Hughes P. Renshaw M. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V. Schwartz M. Ginsberg M. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). That can reduce cell-matrix interactions that are crucial for muscle integrity. To investigate whether activated MAP2 kinase can trigger the destruction of muscle architecture, we established a novel experimental approach: we activated the c-Raf-1/MAP2 kinase signal transduction pathway in muscle fibers by the means of an exogenous protein and investigated whether this activation causes degeneration of muscle tissue.For this purpose, we used the HBV-derived cell-permeable PreS1/PreS2 protein. The PreS2 domain triggers an activation of the c-Raf-1/MAP2-kinase signal transduction pathway. These experiments were controlled using a mutant (17Hildt E. Urban S. Hofschneider P.H. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2055-2066PubMed Google Scholar)2 that displays no activator function and lacks the cell permeability. The reactivity with the antisera used for the detection of these HBV-specific proteins is not affected by this mutation.In one set of experiments we determined the reliability of this novel experimental approach. Immunofluorescence microscopy analysis reveals that the PreS1/PreS2 protein indeed enters the muscle cells surrounding the injection channel, whereas the mutant was only found in the intercellular space.Western blot analysis using an activated MAP-specific antiserum confirmed that the internalized PreS1/PreS2 protein triggers the activation of MAP2 kinase in this experimental system, whereas in the case of the control injected animals no activation could be observed, underlining the specificity of this experimental system. This set of experiments demonstrates that the cell-permeable PreS1/PreS2 protein is suitable to trigger specifically an exogenous activation of the c-Raf-1/MAP2 signal transduction cascade.This novel experimental system provides several advantages. It combines an easy handling with short latency periods. The PreS2 domain triggers highly specifically the activation of the c-Raf-1/MAP2 kinase cascade which has been investigated in detail (16Hildt E. Hofschneider P.H. Recent Res. Cancer Res. 1998; 154: 315-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the existence of the mutant provides the proper control. Because of the spreading capacity of this cell-permeable protein, many cells distant from the injection channel are affected by internalization of the effector protein. This experimental approach provides a model to analyze the direct biological responses of an effector protein in the context of intact tissue.The physiological effects of the activation of the c-Raf-1/MAP2 signal transduction cascade on the architecture of the muscle tissue were investigated by histochemical analysis. Only in the case of the PreS1/PreS2 protein injection, severe changes of muscle tissue histology could be observed. Typical characteristics of muscle fiber degeneration like basophilic degenerated and necrotic fibers accompanied with infiltration of phagocyting cells could be observed. An increased variability of muscle fiber diameter and many fibers with centrally localized nuclei indicated that also muscle cell regeneration occurs. These data demonstrate that the activation of the c-Raf-1/MAP2 kinase signal transduction cascade per se is sufficient to induce muscle degeneration and regeneration resembling early stages of muscular dystrophies.In light of these data we conclude that integrin α7deficiency causes a permanent c-Raf-1/MAP2 kinase activation. The activation of MAP2 kinase triggers muscle cell degeneration and regeneration. Therefore, in the integrin α7-deficient mice the continuous activation of MAP2 kinase contributes to the development of the dystrophic phenotype.

Immunofluorescence microscopy analysis reveals that the PreS1/PreS2 protein indeed enters the muscle cells surrounding the injection channel, whereas the mutant was only found in the intercellular space.Western blot analysis using an activated MAP-specific antiserum confirmed that the internalized PreS1/PreS2 protein triggers the activation of MAP2 kinase in this experimental system, whereas in the case of the control injected animals no activation could be observed, underlining the specificity of this experimental system. This set of experiments demonstrates that the cell-permeable PreS1/PreS2 protein is suitable to trigger specifically an exogenous activation of the c-Raf-1/MAP2 signal transduction cascade.This novel experimental system provides several advantages. It combines an easy handling with short latency periods. The PreS2 domain triggers highly specifically the activation of the c-Raf-1/MAP2 kinase cascade which has been investigated in detail (16Hildt E. Hofschneider P.H. Recent Res. Cancer Res. 1998; 154: 315-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the existence of the mutant provides the proper control. Because of the spreading capacity of this cell-permeable protein, many cells distant from the injection channel are affected by internalization of the effector protein. This experimental approach provides a model to analyze the direct biological responses of an effector protein in the context of intact tissue.The physiological effects of the activation of the c-Raf-1/MAP2 signal transduction cascade on the architecture of the muscle tissue were investigated by histochemical analysis. Only in the case of the PreS1/PreS2 protein injection, severe changes of muscle tissue histology could be observed. Typical characteristics of muscle fiber degeneration like basophilic degenerated and necrotic fibers accompanied with infiltration of phagocyting cells could be observed. An increased variability of muscle fiber diameter and many fibers with centrally localized nuclei indicated that also muscle cell regeneration occurs. These data demonstrate that the activation of the c-Raf-1/MAP2 kinase signal transduction cascade per se is sufficient to induce muscle degeneration and regeneration resembling early stages of muscular dystrophies.In light of these data we conclude that integrin α7deficiency causes a permanent c-Raf-1/MAP2 kinase activation. The activation of MAP2 kinase triggers muscle cell degeneration and regeneration. Therefore, in the integrin α7-deficient mice the continuous activation of MAP2 kinase contributes to the development of the dystrophic phenotype. Integrin α7 deficiency was shown to cause a novel form of muscular dystrophy in mice (11Mayer U. Saher G. Fässler R. Bornemann A. Echtermeyer F. van der Mark H. Miosge N. Pöschl E. van der Mark K. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 318-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). In accordance, patients lacking the integrin α7 subunit develop a myopathy (18Hayashi Y.K. Chou F. Engvall E. Ogawa M. Matsuda C. Hirabayashi S. Yokochi K. Ziober B.L. Kramer R.H. Kaufman S.J. Ozawa E. Goto Y. Nonaka I. Tsukahara T. Wang J. Hoffman E.P. Arahata K. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Integrin α7-deficient mice are viable and fertile, indicating that myogenesis in principle is not affected by loss of α7 integrin. This gives rise to the question of which molecular trigger causes the destruction of the organized muscle architecture, resulting in the dystrophic phenotype. In a recent report it was described that activated Ras/c-Raf-1 pathway is able to down-modulate the activity of β1 or β3 integrins via MAP2 kinase in a transcription-independent manner (8Hughes P. Renshaw M. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V. Schwartz M. Ginsberg M. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Modulation of integrin activity is of major significance for a variety of biological processes as cell migration, which can be considered as an alternation between a high affinity (attachment) and low affinity (detachment) state. Because integrins are known to activate MAP2 kinase by the Ras/Raf mediated cascade, this pathway most probably represents a negative feedback loop controlling integrin activity. In this study we demonstrate that α7 integrin deficiency results in a permanent activation of the c-Raf-1/MAP2 kinase signal transduction pathway in muscle cells. In principle, the observed activation of this signaling cascade could be because of an unspecific secondary effect. However, arguing against an unspecific effect are two observations. First, an activation because of unspecific cellular stress was excluded because both tested markers indicating cellular stress, increased activity of JNK2 and increased amount of Hsp72/73, were not affected by α7 integrin deficiency. Second, the activation of c-Raf-1 and MAP2 kinases in α7integrin-deficient mice is not an age-dependent process, because it was observed at different age stages (between 30 days and 1.5 years; data not shown). The dystrophic phenotype becomes evident in the diaphragm at an age of 2 months (11Mayer U. Saher G. Fässler R. Bornemann A. Echtermeyer F. van der Mark H. Miosge N. Pöschl E. van der Mark K. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 318-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Therefore these data indicate that the activation of c-Raf-1/MAP2 kinase signal transduction pathway by the α7 integrin deficiency can be observed before the phenotype of muscular dystrophy becomes evident. Therefore, it can be excluded that the activation of this signaling cascade is a secondary effect caused by the degenerating/regenerating processes of the muscular dystrophy. In the integrin α7-deficient mice an increased phosphorylation of FAK can be observed, suggesting that the activation of β1 integrins is involved in the activation of c-Raf-1 kinase. In a recent report it was demonstrated that the integrin α7β1 negatively regulates the function of the integrin α5β1 (20Tomatis D. Echtermeyer F. Schober S. Balzac F. Retta S.F. Silengo L. Tarone G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 421-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Therefore, the lack of the α7 subunit could result in an activation of the integrin α5β1, resulting in an activation of FAK. Moreover in the integrin α7-deficient mice a significant change in the composition of the β1 integrin variants occurs. The integrin β1D variant is the only integrin β1 variant that is expressed in the sarcolemma of wild type muscle. In the integrin α7-deficient mice part of the integrin β1D variant is replaced by the integrin β1A variant, resulting in an unaltered amount of β1 integrins. These two variants only differ in their cytoplasmic domains, also affecting their function (21Baudoin C. Van der Flier A. Borradori L. Sonnenberg A. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1996; 4: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 22Belkin A.M. Retta S.F. Pletjushkina O.Y. Balzac F. Silengo L. Fässler R. Koteliansky V.E. Burridge K. Tarone G. J.

The integrin β1D variant mediates a tighter binding to the matrix, and its activity cannot be regulated (21Baudoin C. Van der Flier A. Borradori L. Sonnenberg A. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1996; 4: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 23Belkin A.M. Zhidkova N. Balzac F. Altruda F. Tomatis D. Maier A. Tarone G. Koteliansky V.E. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 211-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Therefore, the reduction of the β1D variant could contribute directly to a diminished tissue stability. In contrast, the integrin β1A variant is well known to be involved in dynamic functions, for example the activation of FAK (21Baudoin C. Van der Flier A. Borradori L. Sonnenberg A. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1996; 4: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). An interaction of integrin β1D and FAK has not been found in vivo. That might be due to the fact that the in vivobinding motif for FAK only exists in the integrin β1Avariant (15Dedhar S. Hannigan G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 657-669Crossref Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Under the conditions of a strong overproduction, however, a β1D-dependent activation of FAK in vitro was reported (23Belkin A.M. Zhidkova N. Balzac F. Altruda F. Tomatis D. Maier A. Tarone G. Koteliansky V.E. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 211-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Therefore, in the integrin α7-deficient mice the change in the integrin β1 variant composition in combination with the loss of the integrin α7 negative regulatory effect can be causative for the observed activation of FAK and subsequently of the c-Raf-1/MAP2 kinase signal transduction pathway. As introduced above, activated MAP2 kinase can down-modulate integrin activity (8Hughes P. Renshaw M. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V. Schwartz M. Ginsberg M. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). That can reduce cell-matrix interactions that are crucial for muscle integrity. To investigate whether activated MAP2 kinase can trigger the destruction of muscle architecture, we established a novel experimental approach: we activated the c-Raf-1/MAP2 kinase signal transduction pathway in muscle fibers by the means of an exogenous protein and investigated whether this activation causes degeneration of muscle tissue. For this purpose, we used the HBV-derived cell-permeable PreS1/PreS2 protein. The PreS2 domain triggers an activation of the c-Raf-1/MAP2-kinase signal transduction pathway. These experiments were controlled using a mutant (17Hildt E. Urban S. Hofschneider P.H. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2055-2066PubMed Google Scholar)2 that displays no activator function and lacks the cell permeability. The reactivity with the antisera used for the detection of these HBV-specific proteins is not affected by this mutation.

https://openalex.org/W1979854220,"We investigated the target sites of three inhibitory monoclonal antibodies on Electrophorusacetylcholinesterase (AChE). Previous studies showed that Elec-403 and Elec-410 are directed to overlapping but distinct epitopes in the peripheral site, at the entrance of the catalytic gorge, whereas Elec-408 binds to a different region. UsingElectrophorus/rat AChE chimeras, we identified surface residues that differed between sensitive and insensitive AChEs: the replacement of a single Electrophorus residue by its rat homolog was able to abolish binding and inhibition, for each antibody. Reciprocally, binding and inhibition by Elec-403 and by Elec-410 could be conferred to rat AChE by the reverse mutation. Elec-410 appears to bind to one side of the active gorge, whereas Elec-403 covers its opening, explaining why the AChE-Elec-410 complex reacts faster than the AChE-Elec-403 or AChE-fasciculin complexes with two active site inhibitors, m-(N,N,N-trimethyltammonio)trifluoro-acetophenone and echothiophate. Elec-408 binds to the region of the putative “back door,” distant from the peripheral site, and does not interfere with the access of inhibitors to the active site.

Anti-cholinesterase inhibitors are used as pesticides; as therapeutic agents in glaucoma, myasthenia gravis, and Alzheimer's disease; and, unfortunately, as nerve gases in chemical warfare. Apart from its vital role in cholinergic transmission, AChE offers a considerable challenge for the understanding of its catalytic efficiency. This enzyme hydrolyzes acetylcholine and similar esters at a very high rate, approaching the upper limit allowed by diffusion of the substrate (1Rosenberry T.L. Adv. Enzymol. 1975; 43: 103-218PubMed Google Scholar, 2Quinn D.M. Chem. Rev. 1987; 87: 955-979Crossref Scopus (953) Google Scholar). However, the three-dimensional structure of AChE, as determined by x-ray cristallography, revealed that its active site can apparently be reached only through a deep and narrow “catalytic gorge” (3Sussman J.L. Harel M. Frolow F. Oefner C. Goldman A. Toker L. Silman I. Science. 1991; 253: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (2438) Google Scholar). This organization would predict that the entrance of a substrate molecule into the active site and the exit of products might create a traffic limitation to the catalytic turnover rate. On the basis of molecular dynamics, it has therefore been proposed that products could leave the active site through a “back door,” transitorily opened by concerted movements within the protein (4Gilson M.K. Straatsma T.P. McCammon J.A. Ripoll D.R. Faerman C.H. Axelsen P.H. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Science. 1994; 263: 1276-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 5Kronman C. Ordentlich A. Barak D. Velan B. Shafferman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27819-27822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it has not yet been possible to directly demonstrate the reality of such movements (6Faerman C. Ripoll D. Bon S. Le Feuvre Y. Morel N. Massoulié J. Sussman J.L. Silman I. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Inhibitors of AChE act on two target sites on the enzyme, the active site and the peripheral site. Inhibitors directed to the active site prevent the binding of a substrate molecule, or its hydrolysis, either by occupying the site with a high affinity (edrophonium and tacrine) or by reacting irreversibly with the catalytic serine (organophosphates and carbamates). The peripheral site consists of a less well defined area, located at the entrance of the catalytic gorge. Inhibitors that bind to this site include small molecules, such as propidium, curare, gallamine, and peptide toxins from Mamba venoms, the fasciculins (7Karlsson E. Mbugua P.M. Rodriguez-Ithurralde D. J. Physiol. 1984; 79: 232-240Google Scholar, 8Marchot P. Khelif A. Ji Y.H. Mansuelle P. Bougis P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12458-12467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bis-quaternary inhibitors, e.g. decamethonium and BW284C51, simultaneously bind to the active and peripheral sites, thus occupying the entire catalytic gorge. The mechanism by which peripheral site inhibitors block the catalytic activity of AChE is currently the subject of a vivid debate. Inhibition can be explained either by steric blockade of the catalytic gorge entrance (9Szegletes T. Mallender W.D. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4206-4216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or by an allosteric mechanism (10Shafferman A. Velan B. Ordentlich A. Kronman C. Grosfeld H. Leitner M. Flashner Y. Cohen S. Barak D. Ariel N. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3561-3568Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structures of AChE-fasciculin complexes show that the entrance of the gorge is blocked by a loop of the toxin, but it is more difficult to imagine that small molecules act in this way (11Bourne Y. Taylor P. Marchot P. Cell. 1995; 83: 503-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 12Harel M. Kleywegt G.J. Ravelli R.B.G. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Structure. 1995; 3: 1355-1366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that occupancy of the peripheral site induces a movement of the Ω loop (67–95), allosterically modifying the orientation of a tryptophan residue, Trp-84, which serves as the choline binding site (13Barak D. Ordentlich A. Bromberg A. Kronman C. Marcus D. Lazar A. Ariel N. Velan B. Shafferman A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15444-15452Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar,14Ordentlich A. Barak D.

Sussman J.L. Doctor B.P. Soreq H. Velan B. Cygler M. Rotundo R.L. Shafferman A. Silman I. Taylor P. Shafferman A. Velan B. Multidisciplinary Approaches to Cholinesterase Functions. Plenum Press, New York1992: 285-288Crossref Google Scholar). According to this view, the binding of a substrate molecule at the peripheral site might explain excess substrate inhibition, a characteristic phenomenon of AChE kinetics (16Radic Z. Reiner E. Taylor P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 98-104PubMed Google Scholar, 17Reiner E. Aldridge N. Simeon V. Radic Z. Taylor P. Massoulié J. Bacou F. Barnard E.A. Chatonnet A. Doctor B.P. Quinn D.M.

New insights on these questions can be provided by analysis of AChE inhibition by antibodies. A number of inhibitory antibodies have been obtained against AChEs from rabbit, fetal bovine serum, and human. Some of these antibodies behave as competitive inhibitors and either prevent or slow down the reaction of the enzyme by organophosphate inhibitors (18Brimijoin S. Mintz K.P. Prendergast F.G. Mol. Pharmacology. 1985; 28: 539-545PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ashani Y. Gentry M.K. Doctor B.P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2456-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 20Gentry M.K. Moorad D.R. Hur R.S. Saxena A. Ashani Y. Doctor B.P. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 842-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Other antibodies act as noncompetitive inhibitors, presumably through an allosteric mechanism (21Saxena A. Hur R. Doctor B.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, the target sites of these antibodies on the enzyme have not been defined. We attempted to approach this question in the case of inhibitory monoclonal antibodies directed against Electrophorus AChE. Three distinct monoclonal antibodies, binding to distinct epitopes, have been analyzed for their specificity toward AChE of different species and for their interference with the binding of conventional inhibitors (22Rémy M.H. Frobert Y. Grassi J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Two inhibitory antibodies, Elec-403 and Elec-410, were mutually exclusive and competitive with peripheral site inhibitors, indicating that they bind near the entrance of the gorge. The third inhibitory antibody, Elec-408, showed no competition with peripheral site ligands or with the other two antibodies, and their effects were additive. Thus, Elec-403 and Elec-410 appear to bind to distinct but overlapping epitopes at the opening of the catalytic gorge, whereas Elec-408 may define a novel regulatory site on the enzyme. We recently cloned and expressed Electrophorus AChE, so that it became possible to explore the target sites of these antibodies by site-directed mutagenesis (23Simon S. Massoulié J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33045-33055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this work, we took advantage of the species specificity of these antibodies. As a first step, we created chimeras between Electrophorus AChE and rat AChE, which is not recognized by the antibodies. An analysis of their inhibition with the antibodies allowed us to define regions that are necessary for antibody binding. As a second step, we designed point mutations that abolished the inhibition of the Electrophorus enzyme by the three antibodies. We thus confirmed that Elec-403 and Elec-410 are targeted to overlapping but not identical parts of the peripheral site, and we showed that Elec-408 binds to a novel regulatory site of AChE, near the putative back door. Reagents for biochemistry were purchased from Prolabo (Paris, France) or from Sigma. Products, enzymes and kits for molecular biology were from Ambion, Biolabs, Invitrogen, Macherey-Nagel, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Promega, and United States Biochemical Corp. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Eurobio (Paris, France). Standard methods were used to construct the fusion proteins (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Biology: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to the method of Kunkel et al. (25Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar) in pCDNA3 (Invitrogen).

Thillet J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 181Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A stop codon was introduced immediately after the catalytic domain, replacing the first residue of the WAT domain (27Simon S. Krejci E. Massoulié J.

The restriction site XbaI (CCCGGG) was introduced in the cDNA encoding rat and ElectrophorusAChE at positions P165-G166 of the peptide sequence or at positions Pro-337–Gly-338. The restriction site AflII (CTTAAG) was introduced at positions Leu-266–Arg-267. Those sites do not modify the peptide sequence. The Electrophorus segments XbaI (site Pro-165–Gly-166)/XbaI (in the polylinker of pCDNA3), AflII (site Leu-266–Arg-267)/XbaI orXbaI (site Pro-337–Gly-338)/XbaI were replaced by the equivalent rat segments, thus creating chimeras El/165/Rt, El/266/Rt, and El/337/Rt (see Fig. 2). Three microchimeras were realized by site-directed mutagenesis, by replacing Electrophorus residues by rat amino acids: (20Gentry M.K. Moorad D.R. Hur R.S. Saxena A. Ashani Y. Doctor B.P. J.

Synthetic transcripts were prepared with the Ambion mMESSAGE mMACHINETM in vitro transcription kit. Xenopus oocytes were injected with samples of around 50 nl (approximately 50 ng of mRNA), and maintained at 19 °C in Barth medium (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 1 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 2.4 mmNaHCO3, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and gentamycin 0.1 g/liter). The secreted AChE fromXenopus oocytes was assayed by the colorimetric method of Ellman et al. (28Ellman G.L. Courtney K.D. Andres V. Featherstone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21715) Google Scholar), using acetylthiocholine as substrate. Enzyme samples were added to 0.2 ml of the assay medium, and the reaction was monitored at 414 nm at 20-s intervals, over a period of 3 min, using a Multiskan RC microplate reader (Labsystems). For the determination of kinetic parameters, nonpurified, secreted AChE was diluted to 0.5 Ellman units (EU)/ml in 1 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin. One EU corresponds to an increase in absorbance of 1 per min, with a path length of 1 cm. For the determination of the values ofK m and K ss, assays were performed at 25 °C in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid), 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and a concentration of acetylthiocholine iodide ranging from 0.05 to 60 mm (15 dilutions in duplicate).K m and Kss were defined by the Haldane equation, fitted with the Kaleidagraph software, as described previously (29Cousin X.

Catalytic turnover values (k cat) were determined by titrating the active sites of AChE with the irreversible inhibitor O-ethylS-(2-(diisopropylamino)-ethyl)methylphosphonothioate (30Vigny M. Bon S. Massoulié J. Leterrier F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 85: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μl of the enzymatic sample (containing 0.5 EU/ml) were incubated with 100 μl of the dilution of O-ethylS-(2-(diisopropylamino)-ethyl)methylphosphonothioate (11 dilutions in duplicate ranging from 0.05 to 0.5 nm) for 18 h at 4 °C. The residual activity was measured by adding 100 μl of 3-fold concentrated Ellman's reagent at 20-s intervals, over a period of 3 min. The values given in Table I correspond to the ratios of k cat for each enzyme to that ofElectrophorus AChE.Table ICatalytic parameters and inhibition of AChEs by chemical inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and fasciculinK mK ssRelativek catPropidiumEdrophoniumBW284C51Elec-403Elec-408Elec-410FasciculinμmmmElec.

A 90-μl aliquot of enzyme (0.2 EU/ml) were incubated with 90 μl of F(ab)′ solutions (11 dilutions, ranging from 2.10−13m to 0.2 mm) or with 90 μl of fasciculin-2 solutions (11 dilutions ranging from 10−14mto 10−7m), in duplicate, for 24 h at 4 °C to ensure equilibrium conditions. After equilibration to room temperature, the residual activity was measured with 20 μl of 10-fold concentrated Ellman's reagent. A 100-μl aliquot of enzyme (0.5 EU/ml) was incubated with 100 μl of inhibition solution (15 dilutions, ranging from 10−9 to 10−3m for propidium, from 3.10−10 to 10−3m for edrophonium, and from 3.10−12 to 10−5m for BW284C51) in duplicate for 2 h at 4 °C. The residual activity was measured with 100 μl of 3-fold concentrated Ellman's reagent by monitoring A 414 nm at 20-s intervals, over a period of 3 min. The purified tetrameric form ofElectrophorus AChE (obtained by treatment of asymmetric forms with trypsin, as described previously (31Grassi J. Frobert Y. Lamourette P. Lagoutte B. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 436-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar)) and its complexes obtained in the presence of an excess of each inhibitory monoclonal antibody or of fasciculin were diluted in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, to approximately the same level of activity (1–2 EU/ml). Aliquots (160 μl), in triplicate, were incubated with 20 μl of buffer or with 20 μl of TMTFA or echothiophate (final concentration, 10−8m) for various times (from 5 min to 1 h). We then added 20 μl of 10-fold concentrated Ellman's reagent, and monitored the remaining activity for 3 min. The plots represent the residual activity as a function of incubation time with the inhibitor and were fitted by a bi-exponential function, from which we obtained pseudo-first-order constants (k obs). The test was performed in microtiter plates (96-well breakapart Immunonunc plates) coated with anti-mouse IgG1 antibodies, as described previously (31Grassi J. Frobert Y. Lamourette P. Lagoutte B. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 436-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). 200 μl of the dilutions (11 dilutions in duplicate, ranging from 2.10−13mto 0.2 mm) of the monovalent fragments (F(ab)′) of the three monoclonal antibodies Elec-403, Elec-408, and Elec-410 were incubated for 3–4 h at room temperature. After extensive washing, 200 μl of AChE (0.1 EU/ml) were incubated overnight with immobilized F(ab)′ in each well at 4 °C. The plates were then washed, prior to addition of 200 μl of Ellman's reagent to each well. In the presence of an excess of inhibitory antibody,Electrophorus AChE still shows a residual activity: 1% with Elec-403, 7% with Elec-410, and 30% with Elec-408 (22Rémy M.H. Frobert Y. Grassi J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This reflects an intrinsic activity of the AChE-antibody complexes, as shown, for example, by the fact that it could be further reduced by addition of a second, compatible inhibitory antibody (22Rémy M.H. Frobert Y. Grassi J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The presence of a measurable residual activity indicates that the substrate, acetylthiocholine, is still able to reach the active site in the complex, but this access may be severely restricted. In order to obtain an indication about a possible blockade of entry into the active site by the monoclonal antibodies, we analyzed the effect of two active site inhibitors on the residual activity of AChE-antibody complexes. We used echothiophate, a positively charged organophosphate inhibitor containing a choline moiety, and TMTFA, an analog of the tetrahedral intermediate, possessing a very high affinity for the active site (32Nair H.K. Lee K. Quinn D.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 9939-9941Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar,33Nair H.K. Seravalli J. Arbuckle T. Quinn D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8566-8576Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the kinetics of AChE inhibition with echothiophate and TMTFA. We used comparable activities of AChE alone, and of its complexes with a noninhibitory antibody, Elec-106, with each of the three inhibitory antibodies and with fasciculin; in the case of inhibitory antibodies and fasciculin, the total concentrations of enzyme were increased, in order to obtain the same residual activity as with the noninhibited enzyme. The rate of inactivation appeared slightly accelerated in the case of Elec-106, showing that the formation of a multivalent complex did not reduce the accessibility of the active site. Elec-408 had no effect on the rate of inhibition by either echothiophate or TMTFA. Elec-410 did not significantly reduce the rate of reaction with echothiophate but decreased the rate of binding of TMTFA: the first order rate constant,k obs, was 0.1 min−1 for free AChE and 0.04 min−1 for the complex. The most striking effect, however, was observed with Elec-403, which reduced the rates of inhibition by both echothiophate and TMTFA. In this case, the curves could be fitted with two exponentials, one of which showed the same rate as the free enzyme: this probably corresponds to a small proportion of enzyme that was not bound by the antibody and represents a relatively high proportion of residual activity, because of the very low activity of the AChE-Elec-403 complex. The slowly reacting component, representing the AChE-Elec-403 complex, shows a rate of 0.0003 min−1 with TMTFA (0.02 min−1 for the free enzyme), and 0.001 min−1 with echothiophate (0.015 min−1 for the free enzyme). The differences observed between the Elec-403, Elec-408, and Elec-410 antibodies show that they do not interfere with AChE in the same way, in agreement with the fact that they bind to distinct epitopes. In order to obtain information about the target sites of the three inhibitory antibodies, we prepared Electrophorus/rat chimeric constructs, by introducing restriction sites in the coding sequences of the two enzymes, without modifying the encoded peptide sequences. Chimeras El/165/Rt, El/266/Rt and El/337/Rt contain increasingly longer N-terminal regions ofElectrophorus AChE, fused with the complementary rat peptide regions, beyond residues 165, 266, and337. We introduced a stop codon at the end of the catalytic domain so that these constructs produced soluble AChE monomers (34Duval N. Massoulié J. Bon S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 641-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar,35Morel N. Massoulié J. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The distribution of Electrophorus and rat regions on the surface of the catalytic subunit is schematically illustrated in Fig. 2. The three chimeras were active, and their catalytic parameters, as well as their sensitivity to classical inhibitors, show that they do not markedly differ from the parent natural AChEs (Table I). We analyzed the sensitivity of the Electrophorus, rat and chimeric enzymes to monovalent fragments F(ab)′ obtained from the three inhibitory monoclonal antibodies and to fasciculin (Fig.3). The chimeras were inhibited by fasciculin, in agreement with the fact that both parent enzymes are sensitive to this toxin (Fig. 3 A). However, it is surprising that the El/337/Rt chimera, which contains the largestElectrophorus peptide segment, is more sensitive to inhibition by fasciculin than the rat enzyme. Elec-410, which also binds to the peripheral site, was found to inhibit the three chimeras, El/165/Rt, El/266/Rt, and El/337/Rt (Fig. 3 B). This showed that the N-terminal fragment preceding position 165, which constitutes the only distinct Electrophorus contribution in chimera El/165/Rt, must contain residues that are sufficient for the binding of Elec-410. Elec-410 differs from Elec-403 because it inhibits Bungarus AChE, although less strongly thanElectrophorus AChE (22Rémy M.H. Frobert Y. Grassi J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It has no effect onTorpedo or mammalian AChEs. We thus looked for residues in the N-terminal segment that would be exposed, involved in the contact with fasciculin and common to Electrophorus andBungarus AChE sequences, but different from the other AChE sequences. These criteria identified Ser-74 (replaced by Leu in rat AChE) as a possible player in this interaction. In fact, mutation S74L abolished inhibition by both Elec-403 and Elec-410 (Table I). It increased 5-fold the affinity of the enzyme for fasciculin but did not affect inhibition by Elec-408. In the case of Elec-403, which is directed to the peripheral site, chimeras El/165/Rt and El/266/Rt showed no inhibition and did not bind the antibody (Fig. 3 C). Chimera El/337/Rt was inhibited by Elec-403 and in fact showed a 100-fold higher affinity than Electrophorus AChE. There was essentially no residual activity in the presence of an excess of antibody. The fact that chimera El/337/Rt is sensitive to Elec-403, whereas chimera El/266/Rt is not, suggests that the segment by which they differ, located between positions266 and 337, participates in the antibody target site (see Fig. 2). Within this segment, we searched for residues that might be responsible for the selectivity of Elec-403 towardElectrophorus AChE, in contrast with AChEs from rat, bovine, human, Bungarus or Torpedo, the sequences of which are also known. For this purpose we looked for residues that would differ between Electrophorus AChE and these various sequences and that would be exposed at the surface of the protein and involved in the contact with fasciculin (11Bourne Y. Taylor P. Marchot P. Cell. 1995; 83: 503-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 12Harel M. Kleywegt G.J. Ravelli R.B.G. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Structure. 1995; 3: 1355-1366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Residues Gln-277 and Leu-280 meet these requirements and are both replaced by His in rat AChE. Mutating each of these residues by their rat counterparts abolished inhibition by Elec-403. The L280H mutant was inhibited by Elec-410 and fasciculin, with a slightly reduced affinity than the wild type ElectrophorusAChE; its sensitivity to Elec-408 was not modified (Table I). Elec-408 proved unable to inhibit or bind the chimeras, except for a weak inhibition of chimera El/337/Rt, above 10−8m (Fig. 3 D). This showed that the C-terminal segment, beyond position 337, probably contains important residues for interaction with Elec-408. Because this region is much less conserved between AChEs than the N-terminal part of the protein, and because we had no clue about the target of Elec-408, it was not possible to directly identify residues that would be likely to participate in its binding. We therefore constructed microchimeras, in which a short peptide segment of Electrophorus AChE was replaced by its rat counterpart. The inhibitory effect of Elec-408 remained unchanged in the case of peptides 20–28 and507–514, it was only slightly reduced after replacement of peptide 484–491 (INVDGSIDSRR in Electrophorusreplaced by the shorter rat peptide DPRDSKSP), and was totally abolished after replacement of peptide 453–467(EKRLNYTLEEERLSR to DPSLNYTVEERIFAQ). We then showed that point mutations of a single residue within this peptide, L460V or E463R, also abolished inhibition by Elec-408. In contrast, inhibition by Elec-403, Elec-410, or fasciculin was not affected by these mutations. The distance of these residues from the peripheral site is too large to be covered by an antibody, in agreement with the previous conclusion that Elec-408 acts at a distinct site. Residues 460 and 463 are close to the putative back door, which was proposed to allow the exit of reaction products by the opening of a passage between residues Val-129, Gly-441, and Trp-84. It is therefore possible that Elec-408 acts by interfering with this back door mechanism. In order to examine whether the back door residues might be directly involved in its binding, we mutated valine Val-129 into a leucine, expecting that the presence of a larger side chain at this position might affect the binding of the antibody and/or the catalytic turnover rate of the enzyme. The kinetic constants of the mutant enzyme are given in Table I: its K m value was increased about 2-fold, and the IC50 for edrophonium was increased more than 4-fold, indicating a conformational perturbation in the active site. However, inhibition by Elec-403, Elec-408, or Elec-410 was not affected by this mutation. For all chimeras and point mutants, we analyzed the binding of the three inhibitory monoclonal antibodies by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (not shown) (31Grassi J. Frobert Y. Lamourette P. Lagoutte B. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 436-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In all cases, we found a complete correlation between binding and inhibition. The preceding results show that it is possible to suppress the binding of a monoclonal antibody by replacement of a single residue, explaining their species specificity. Conversely, we wondered whether it would be possible to create a binding site by mutagenesis of rat AChE. Antibody Elec-410 appeared to be a good candidate, because it reacts with Bungarus AChE, in addition to Electrophorus AChE, showing a broader specificity than Elec-403 and Elec-408. Mutation S74L abolished the interaction of Electrophorus AChE with Elec-410, and according to our three-dimensional model, the surface residues surrounding this position in the peripheral site are conserved between the two species. We therefore made the reverse mutation in rat AChE, L74S. The rat L74S mutant was clearly bound by Elec-410 in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (not shown) and was inhibited by this antibody above 10−7m(Fig. 3 C). Although it appeared more difficult, we also attempted to render the rat AChE sensitive to Elec-403, by replacing three residues by theirElectrophorus counterparts (L74S, H277Q, and H280L). The resulting enzyme was active and was inhibited by Elec-403. The degree of inhibition, as a function of antibody concentration, was identical to that ofElectrophorus AChE (Fig. 3 B). This investigation was initiated mainly as an attempt to define the target sites of the inhibitory antibodies Elec-403, Elec-408, and Elec-410. We studied chimeras between the sensitiveElectrophorus and the insensitive rat enzymes. Catalytically active chimeras showed only moderate differences with the parent enzymes in their K m,K ss, and k cat parameters and in their sensitivity to reversible inhibitors directed against the active site (edrophonium), the peripheral site (propidium), or both (BW284C51), as shown in Table I. The observed variations confirm that multiple regions of the enzyme contribute to its catalytic properties and to its interaction with inhibitors. An analysis of the sensitivity of the chimeras to the inhibitory antibodies confirmed unambiguously that Elec-403, Elec-408, and Elec-410 are directed to distinct sites. Assuming that the F(ab)′ antibodies interact only with exposed residues, in a contact zone that does not extend over more than 6 residues across, we could delineate their recognition sites. This analysis led us to consistent results, despite paradoxical effects: for example, chimera El/337/Rt showed a considerably higher affinity for Elec-403 than did Electrophorus AChE. In the case of Elec-403 and Elec-410, which were known to interact with the peripheral site (22Rémy M.H. Frobert Y. Grassi J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), a comparison between the sequences of the chimeras and those of sensitive and insensitive enzymes identified a few residues that might be specifically involved in the target sites. In the case of Elec-408, a series of microchimeras, involving peptide segments of about 15 residues, allowed us to identify the region of binding. These predictions were entirely borne out by site directed mutation of a few residues: in each case, the replacement of a singleElectrophorus residue by its rat counterpart was able to totally abolish the binding of the antibody and consequently its inhibitory effect. Thus, Ser-74 and Leu-280 ofElectrophorus AChE are in the contact zone of Elec-403, Ser-74 is also in the contact zone of Elec-410, and Glu-463 is in the contact zone of Elec-408. Such dramatic effects are not due to the fact that we usually replaced a small residue with a larger one, because the replacement by a smaller residue was equally effective in some cases (L460V abolished the binding of Elec-408). In the chimeras, as well as in the point mutants, we found that a loss of inhibition by the monoclonal antibodies was always paralleled by a loss of binding. Therefore, we never obtained mutants that would have become resistant by disruption of an allosteric mechanism. Because the replacement of a single residue could abolish the binding of an antibody to Electrophorus AChE, we investigated whether the reciprocal mutation might create a binding site on the rat AChE. The case of Elec-410 appeared favorable, and indeed, the L74S mutant did bind the antibody, although at relatively high concentrations (above 10−7m). We observed an inhibition, directly resulting from the binding of the antibody. In the case of Elec-403, the replacement of three residues in the rat AChE (L74S, H277Q, and H280L) was even more impressive, because the sensitivity of the mutated enzyme was equivalent to that of Electrophorus AChE. These experiments conclusively confirm the localization of the binding/inhibition sites. Figs. 4 and5 show that the target sites of Elec-403 and Elec-410 are distinct but overlap, because they both include Ser-74 and are located at the entrance of the gorge, in agreement with the fact that these antibodies can be displaced by peripheral site ligands. Elec-410 binds to one side of the opening of the catalytic gorge, whereas Elec-403 spanned this opening, in a manner similar to that of fasciculin (11Bourne Y. Taylor P. Marchot P. Cell. 1995; 83: 503-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 12Harel M. Kleywegt G.J. Ravelli R.B.G. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Structure. 1995; 3: 1355-1366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). This difference may explain the fact that the residual activity of the AChE-Elec-410 complex is about 7-fold higher than that of the AChE-Elec-403 complex, which represents only 1% of the activity of the free enzyme. We analyzed the effect of the antibodies on the access to the active site with the reversible inhibitor TMTFA and the organophosphate inhibitor echothiophate. The AChE-Elec-408 complex was inactivated as rapidly as the free enzyme by both inhibitors, in agreement with the fact that Elec-408 does not interfere with the entrance of the catalytic gorge. The Elec-410 complex showed the same rate of inactivation as the free enzyme with echothiophate but a reduced rate of binding of TMTFA. The Elec-403 complex, like the AChE-fasciculin complex, showed a very dramatically reduced rate of inactivation with both compounds. These inhibition rates showed that Elec-403 blocks the access to the active site as efficiently as fasciculin, and much more than Elec-410.Figure 5Localization of antibody binding sites and of residues that differ from rat AChE , on a three-dimensional model ofElectrophorus AChE .

This characteristic is shared by two inhibitory monoclonal antibodies that have been reported in the literature to act through an allosteric mechanism: 13D8 (21Saxena A. Hur R. Doctor B.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and C1B7 (36Olson C.E. Chhajlani V. August J.T. Schmell E.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 227: 361-367Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar), which have been produced against bovine and human AChE, respectively. The fact that Elec-408 binds near the back door suggests that it may interfere with its opening. This mechanism would explain why the AChE-Elec-408 complex retains a much higher residual activity (30%) than the complexes with peripheral site-directed antibodies, because there is another exit route from the active site. However, Elec-408 may also inhibit the enzyme by inducing a conformational change in the active site, which is very close to its binding site. Several groups are attempting to determine the three-dimensional structure of Electrophorus AChE by x-ray crystallography. This will bring more information on the structure of the target sites of our inhibitory antibodies and open the way for a crystallographic analysis of antibody-enzyme complexes, which might provide more definitive evidence on the back door hypothesis and also show whether the peripheral site-directed antibodies act by blocking the entrance of the gorge or through an allosteric mechanism.

They subsequently showed that residues 45 and 47 determine the binding affinities of TGF-β isoforms toward α2-macroglobulin (16Burmester J.K. Qian S.W. Roberts A.B. Huang A. Amatayakul-Chantler S.

Tsang M.L.-S. Weatherbee J.A. Hinck A.P. Ohlsen D.J. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30656-30662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar,18Burmester J.K.

Recently, we determined the TGF-β antagonist activities of synthetic pentacosapeptides with overlapping amino acid sequences covering most of the TGF-β1 molecule (19Huang S.S. Liu Q. Johnson F.E. Konish Y. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27155-27159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Of these seven pentacosapeptides, only the one containing residues 41–65 of TGF-β1 (termed β125-(41–65)) exhibited potent TGF-β antagonist activity (19Huang S.S. Liu Q. Johnson F.E. Konish Y. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27155-27159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The replacement of both residues Trp52 and Asp55 by alanine completely abrogated the TGF-β antagonist activity of this pentacosapeptide (19Huang S.S. Liu Q. Johnson F.E. Konish Y. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27155-27159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Multiple conjugation of β125-(41–65) to the carrier proteins bovine serum albumin and carbonic anhydrase conferred TGF-β agonist activity as measured by growth inhibition (19Huang S.S. Liu Q. Johnson F.E. Konish Y. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27155-27159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These results led us to identify structurally unrelated TGF-β partial agonists, which also possess two or more WXXD motifs per dimer or molecule (20Leal S.M. Liu Q. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20572-20576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 21Huang S.S. Cerullo M.A. Huang F.W. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26030-26041Google Scholar). Based on these studies, we hypothesized that the WSLD motif (52nd to 55th amino acid residues of TGF-β1) is an active site that interacts with TGF-β receptors; this interaction leads to growth inhibition. To test this hypothesis, we prepared an antibody that specifically reacts with β125-(41–65) and determined its effect on the biological activities of TGF-β1. In addition, we generated TGF-β1 mutant proteins in which residues Trp52 and/or Asp55 are replaced by alanine and compared the biological activity of wild type TGF-β1 with those of the mutants. In this communication, we show that this antibody blocks 125I-TGF-β binding to TGF-β receptors and abolishes TGF-β1-induced growth inhibition in mink lung epithelial cells (Mv1Lu cells). We also demonstrate that the TGF-β1 mutant in which both Trp52 and Asp55 are replaced with alanine residues has diminished growth inhibitory activity in Mv1Lu cells and has diminished ability to induce autocrine growth of transfected NIH 3T3 cells. Na125I (17 Ci/mg) and [methyl-3H]thymidine (67 Ci/mmol) were purchased from ICN Radiochemicals (Irvine, CA). High molecular mass protein standards (myosin, 205 kDa; β-galactosidase, 116 kDa; phosphorylase, 97 kDa; bovine serum albumin, 66 kDa) were purchased from Sigma. Disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) was obtained from Pierce. TGF-β1 was purchased from Austral Biologicals (San Ramon, CA). Pan-specific TGF-β neutralizing antibody and porcine TGF-β1 were purchased from R & D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). TGF-β1 immunoassay kit was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). The pentacosapeptide β125-(41–65), whose amino acid sequence corresponds to the 41st to 65th amino acid residues of TGF-β1, was prepared as described previously (19Huang S.S. Liu Q. Johnson F.E. Konish Y. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27155-27159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Porcine TGF-β1 cDNAs, pPTGFbeta1 and pSQneo-TGF-β1, were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and Drs. Su Wen Qian and Anita B. Roberts (NCI), respectively. Diff-Quik solutions were obtained from American Scientific Products (McGraw Park, IL). β125-(41–65) was conjugated to bovine thyroglobulin using glutaraldehyde according to the procedure described previously (22Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12608-12618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). β125-(41–65)-thyroglobulin conjugate was injected subcutaneously with adjuvants into rabbits for generation of antiserum (22Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12608-12618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The antibody (IgG) to β125-(41–65) was purified with protein A-Sepharose using standard procedures. Its specificity was verified by Western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 125I-TGF-β1 was prepared by iodination of TGF-β1 with Na125I and chloramine T as described previously (20Leal S.M.

Huang J.S. . 1997; 272: 18891-18895Google Scholar). The specific radioactivity of 125I-TGF-β1 was 1–3 × 105 cpm/ng. Mv1Lu cells grown on 24-well clustered dishes were incubated with 0.1 nm125I-TGF-β1 and various concentrations of antibody to β125-(41–65) both with and without 10 μm β125-(41–65), a specific TGF-β peptide antagonist, in binding buffer (20Leal S.M.

Huang J.S. . 1997; 272: 18891-18895Google Scholar).125I-TGF-β1 was preincubated with antibody to β125-(41–65) at room temperature for 1 h prior to incubation with cells. After 2.5 h at 0 °C, the cells were washed with binding buffer, and the cell-associated radioactivity was determined. The specific binding of125I-TGF-β1 to TGF-β receptors in Mv1Lu cells was estimated by subtracting nonspecific binding (obtained in the presence of 10 μmβ125-(41–65)) from total binding. All experiments were carried out in quadruplicate. Mv1Lu cells grown on 35-mm Petri dishes were incubated with 0.1 nm125I-TGF-β1 in the presence of various concentrations of control IgG or antibody to β125-(41–65) or 10 μmβ125-(41–65) (for measurement of nonspecific binding) in binding buffer (20Leal S.M.

Huang J.S. . 1997; 272: 18891-18895Google Scholar). After 2.5 h at 0 °C,125I-TGF-β1-affinity labeling was carried out in the presence of DSS (20Leal S.M. Liu Q. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol.

The125I-TGF-β1-affinity-labeled TGF-β receptors were analyzed by 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions and autoradiography. Various concentrations of TGF-β1 and 50 μg/ml antibody to β125-(41–65) or control IgG were preincubated for 1 h at room temperature and then added to Mv1Lu cells grown on 24-well clustered dishes with DMEM containing 0.1% fetal calf serum. After 16 h at 37 °C, the cells were pulsed with 1 μCi/ml [methyl-3H]thymidine for 4 h. The cells were then washed twice with 10% trichloroacetic acid and once with ethanol:ether (2:1, v/v). The [methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation into cellular DNA was then determined by liquid scintillation counting. A two-step PCR procedure was used to generate point mutations. Primers included: A, 5′ GAATTCAGATCTGAGATGGCGCCTTCGGGGCTGC (TGF-β1 906–918); B, 5′ GAATTCAGATCTTCAGCTGCACTTGCAGGAACGC (TGF-β12057–2078); C, 5′ CCCTACATCGCCAGCCTAGACACT; D, 5′ CTGAGTGTCTAGGCTGGCGATGTA; E, 5′ GGAGCCTAGCCACTCAGTACAGCAAGG; F, 5′ GCTGTACTGAGTGGCTAGGCTCCAGATG; G, 5′ CCCTACATCGCGAGCCTAGCCACTCAGTAC; H, 5′ GTACTGAGTGGCTAGGCTCGCGATGTAGGG; I, 5′ CCTACATCTGGGCGCTAGACACTCAG; J, 5′CTGAGTGTCTAGCGCCCAGATGTAGG. The underlined nucleotides indicate the mutations. To introduce the tryptophan 52 to alanine (W52A) mutation, porcine TGF-β1 cDNA (pPTGFbeta1 from American Type Culture Collection) and primers A/D and C/B were used in the first PCR reaction to generate ∼1-kb and 200-bp fragments, respectively. The reaction mixture was treated with 5 units of Klenou fragment and gel-purified. The ∼1-kb and 200-bp fragments were then used as templates in the second PCR reaction using Primers A and B to generate the full-length cDNA. The PCR product was cloned into the pT7 Blue T-Vector, and the plasmid was purified. The purified plasmid was cut with BsgI to produce a 340-base pair fragment containing the mutated sequence. This 340-base pair fragment was then ligated to pSV·SPORT 1-TGF-β1, which was digested with BsgI to delete the corresponding fragment. This ligated product was purified and identified. For D55A, S53A, and W52A/D55A mutants, the above procedure was repeated, but using A/F and E/B for D55A mutation, A/J and I/B for S53A mutation, and A/H and G/B for W52A/D55A mutation. The plasmids containing wild-type TGF-β1 and TGF-β1 mutant cDNAs in pSV·SPORT 1 were then cut with KpnI and XbaI. The ∼1.6-kb cDNA insert was then ligated to the expression vector pMSXND. NIH 3T3 and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were transfected with pMSXND vector only or pMSXND containing the insert of wild-type or mutant TGF-β1 cDNA using the calcium phosphate-transfection method. NIH 3T3 and CHO cells stably expressing vector only, wild-type TGF-β1 cDNA, or mutant TGF-β1 cDNAs were selected with 800 μg/ml G418. Four or more clones for the expression of each construct were isolated. The production of wild-type and mutant TGF-β1was carried out according to the procedure of Qian et al.(15Qian S.W.

After acid activation and lyophilization, the conditioned media were subjected to reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (C8 column) using a linear gradient of acetonitrile (0 to 70%) in 10% trifluoroacetic acid. Wild-type and mutant TGF-β1 were eluted at ∼30% acetonitrile. Wild-type and mutant TGF-β1 were quantitated by enzyme-linked immunoassay using the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Promega, Madison, WI). During the assay, an internal standard of porcine TGF-β1was included in the samples. The putative active-site motif (WSLD) is located in a loop (residues 46–56) of the TGF-β molecule, which is accessible to solvent (9Schlunegger M.P. Grütter M.G.

We predicted that antibody raised to β125-(41–65) containing this motif would block both TGF-β1 binding to TGF-β receptors and the biological activities of TGF-β1. To test this, we prepared rabbit antiserum to β125-(41–65) using the thyroglobulin conjugate of β125-(41–65) as antigen. The effect of antibody to β125-(41–65) on125I-TGF-β1 binding to TGF-β receptors in Mv1Lu cells was then determined. As shown in TableI, the antiserum to β125-(41–65) specifically immunoprecipitated125I-TGF-β1, while nonimmune serum did not significantly immunoprecipitate 125I-TGF-β1. The purified antibody to β125-(41–65) quantitatively inhibited 125I-TGF-β1 binding to Mv1Lu cells (Fig. 1 A). At ∼75 μg/ml, the antibody to β125-(41–65) completely abrogated the specific binding of 0.1 nm125I-TGF-β1 to TGF-β receptors in Mv1Lu cells. By contrast, control IgG did not show any effect on125I-TGF-β1 binding to cells at the same concentration. The 125I-TGF-β1-affinity labeling analysis revealed that, like β125-(41–65), a TGF-β antagonist, the antibody to β125-(41–65) effectively blocked125I-TGF-β1 binding to all TGF-β receptor types, including type I, II, III, and V TGF-β receptors (TβR-I, TβR-II, TβR-III, TβR-V) (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3and 4). To define the functional significance of the inhibition of TGF-β1 binding to TGF-β receptors, we determined the effect of antibody to β125-(41–65) on TGF-β1-induced growth inhibition of Mv1Lu cells, as measured by [methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation into cellular DNA. As shown in Fig. 1 C, the antibody blocked TGF-β1-induced inhibition of DNA synthesis in Mv1Lu cells. At 50 μg/ml, the antibody to β125-(41–65) completely blocked the inhibition of DNA synthesis induced by 0.25–8 pmTGF-β1 in these cells. The control IgG did not affect the TGF-β1-induced inhibition of DNA synthesis. These results are consistent with the reports that the loop (residues 46–56, which contain the WSLD motif) included in amino acid residues 41–65 is exposed (9Schlunegger M.P. Grütter M.G.

The results also suggest that this loop may be involved in the interaction of TGF-β1 with TGF-β receptors.Table IImmunoprecipitation of 125I-TGF-β1 by antiserum to β125-(41–65)125I-TGF-β1immunoprecipitatedcpmControl2,741 ± 101+Non-immune serum3,575 ± 821+Antiserum to β125-(41–65)13,092 ± 1,714125I-TGF-β1 (0.1 ng) was incubated with 5 μl of antiserum to β125-(41–65) or non-immune serum in 100 μl of 25 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, or 0.15 mNaCl containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin.

After 8 h at 4 °C, the immunocomplexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose (1.5 h, 4 °C), washed, and counted. The experiments were carried out in triplicate. To confirm that the WSLD motif (52nd to 55th residues) is important in the interaction of TGF-β1 with TGF-β receptors, we generated porcine wild-type TGF-β1 and TGF-β1 mutants in which Trp52, Ser53, and/or Asp55 were replaced by alanine residues by stably expressing their cDNA constructs in NIH 3T3 and CHO cells. The residue Leu54 was not replaced, since the corresponding residue is not conserved in TGF-β2, which has the motif WSSD. The growth inhibitory activities of wild-type and mutant TGF-β1 purified from the culture media of transfected NIH 3T3 and CHO cells were determined by measuring their inhibitory activity on DNA synthesis in Mv1Lu cells. As shown in Fig. 2, both wild-type TGF-β1 and TGF-β1 S53A mutant (in which the 53rd residue, serine, is replaced by alanine) inhibited [methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation into cellular DNA with identical IC50 of 0.3 ± 0.1 pm and 0.3 ± 0.2 pm (mean ± S.E.,n = 7 experiments), respectively. In contrast, the TGF-β1 mutants TGF-β1 W52A, TGF-β1 D55A, and TGF-β1 W52A/D55A had diminished activities in inhibition of DNA synthesis of Mv1Lu cells with IC50 of 0.6 ± 0.2, 1.3 ± 0.4, and 3.0 ± 0.8 pm (mean ± S.E., n = 7 experiments), respectively. The double mutant TGF-β1W52A/D55A appeared to possess only ∼10% of the activity of wild-type TGF-β1. These results suggest that theWSLD motif plays an important role in the activity of TGF-β1. TGF-β is a bifunctional growth regulator (1Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (3004) Google Scholar, 2Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Sporn M.B.

During culture of NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with wild-type TGF-β1 cDNA, we noticed that these transfected cells proliferated faster than NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected either with vector only or with TGF-β W52A/D55A cDNA. To see if the faster growth of the transfected cells is due to autocrine stimulation by the transfected wild-type TGF-β1, we determined the effect of neutralizing antibody to TGF-β1 on growth of NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with wild-type TGF-β1 cDNA. As shown in Fig.3, A, C, andE, NIH 3T3 cells expressing wild-type TGF-β1proliferated faster than cells expressing TGF-β1W52A/D55A and control cells (transfected with vector only) as determined by an autocrine growth assay in which autocrine-stimulated cells grow to form larger size colonies compared with cells without this stimulation. The order of the growth rates is: cells expressing wild-type TGF-β1 > cells expressing TGF-β1W52A/D55A > control cells (Fig. 3, A, C, and E). Both cells expressing wild-type TGF-β1and TGF-β1 W52A/D55A exhibited similar levels of wild-type and mutant TGF-β1 transcripts (data not shown). On the other hand, culture of NIH 3T3 cells expressing wild-type TGF-β1 and TGF-β1 W52A/D55A in the presence of a neutralizing antibody to TGF-β1 had diminished growth rates, which were comparable with that of NIH 3T3 cells transfected with vector only (Fig. 3, B, D, andF). These results indicate that the faster proliferation of NIH 3T3 cells expressing wild-type TGF-β1 is due to autocrine stimulation by expressed wild-type TGF-β1. These results also suggest that the TGF-β1 W52A/D55A mutant has significantly diminished ability to induce autocrine growth of transfected NIH 3T3 cells when compared with wild-type TGF-β1. We have shown that specific antibody to β125-(41–65) at ∼75 μg/ml completely blocks 125I-TGF-β1 binding to TGF-β receptors and also blocks TGF-β1-induced inhibition of DNA synthesis in Mv1Lu cells. The antibody reported here appears to be more potent than those reported by Flanders et al. (24Flanders K.C. Roberts A.B. Ling N. Fleurdelys B.E. Sporn M.B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Of their five antisera to TGF-β1 peptide fragments, those directed against residues 50–75 and 78–109 blocked only 40 and 80% of 125I-TGF-β1 binding to cells, respectively, at 450 μg/ml. So far, only antibodies raised to the intact TGF-β dimer have been shown to completely block TGF-β activities (24Flanders K.C. Roberts A.B. Ling N. Fleurdelys B.E. Sporn M.B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 25Wang J. Sun L. Myeroff L. Wang X. Gentry L.E. Yang J. Liang J. Zborowska E. Markowitz S. Wilson J.K.V. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22044-22049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The potent TGF-β antagonist activity of our antibody to β125-(41–65) strongly suggests that the region of the amino acid residues 41–65 of TGF-β1 is exposed and may be involved in receptor binding. The putative active site WSLD of TGF-β1, which is included in the amino acid sequence of β125-(41–65), was proposed based on the following observations. 1) Of seven synthetic pentacosapeptides with overlapping amino acid sequences covering most of the TGF-β1 molecule, only the peptide of residues 41–65 (β125-(41–65)) exhibits potent TGF-β antagonist activity (19Huang S.S. Liu Q. Johnson F.E. Konish Y. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27155-27159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). 2) The β125-(41–65) structural variant β125-(41–65) W52A/D55A, in which both Trp52 and Asp55 are replaced by alanine residues, does not show a significant TGF-β antagonist activity (19Huang S.S. Liu Q. Johnson F.E. Konish Y. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27155-27159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). 3) Multiple conjugation of β125-(41–65) to carrier proteins confers TGF-β agonist activity as measured by growth inhibition but not transcriptional activation (19Huang S.S. Liu Q. Johnson F.E. Konish Y. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27155-27159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Here we show that the double mutations of Trp52 and Asp55 and single mutation of either Trp52 or Asp55 of TGF-β1 diminish the growth inhibitory activity of TGF-β1 by 90 and 50–75%, respectively. Not only does the double mutant TGF-β1 W52A/D55A possess only 10% activity of wild-type TGF-β1, but it also appears to have significantly diminished ability to stimulate growth of transfected NIH 3T3 cells by an autocrine mechanism. These results support the hypothesis that the WSLD is an active site of TGF-β1(Fig. 4). However, the inability of the double mutations of Trp52 and Asp55 to completely abolish the TGF-β activities implies that there are other binding sites in addition to the WSLD site. One candidate appears to be the region of residues 91–96, since this region is important for TGF-β1 binding to TβR-II in solution and TGF-β receptors in cells (17Qian S.W. Burmester J.K. Tsang M.L.-S. Weatherbee J.A. Hinck A.P. Ohlsen D.J. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30656-30662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and since antibodies to residues 78–109 block TGF-β1 binding to TGF-β receptors in cells (23Liu Q. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. . 1997; 272: 18891-18895Google Scholar). The three-dimensional configuration of residues 91–96 seems to be required to constitute this binding site, because a synthetic pentacosapeptide β125-(81–105) with amino acid residues 81–105 of TGF-β1 does not show any TGF-β antagonist activity (18Burmester J.K. Qian S.W. Ohlsen D. Phan S. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Growth Factors. 1998; 15: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the proposed receptor binding sites (Fig. 4), which are contributed by the two monomers in TGF-β1, are similar to those of vascular endothelial cell growth factor; the vascular endothelial cell growth factor receptor is in contact with both subunits of the ligand, a disulfide-linked homodimer protein (26Wiesmann C. Fuh G. Christinger H.W. Eigenbrot C. Wells J.A. de Vos A.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 696-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The hypothesis of the two major binding sites (the WSLD motif and a C-terminal site, residues 91–96), which are contributed by the two TGF-β1 monomers, is supported by the following observations: 1) the formation of disulfide-linked dimers of TGF-β1 is important for its activities (27Amatayakul-Chantler S. Qian S.W. Gakenheimer K. Böttinger E.P. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27687-27691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); 2) antibodies to these two binding sites block TGF-β1binding to TGF-β receptors and TGF-β1-stimulated activities (Ref. 24Flanders K.C. Roberts A.B. Ling N. Fleurdelys B.E. Sporn M.B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar and this study); 3) like TGF-β2, TGF-β1/TGF-β2 (92–98) hybrids fail to bind to the soluble type II TGF-β receptor (18Burmester J.K. Qian S.W. Ohlsen D. Phan S. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Growth Factors. 1998; 15: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar); and 4) the TGF-β1 W52A/D55A mutant exhibits diminished growth regulatory activities as compared with those of wild type TGF-β1 (this study). The importance of theWLSD motif in mediating growth regulatory activity of TGF-β1 is also supported by the findings that several structurally unrelated proteins that contain two or moreW XX D motifs per dimer or molecule show TGF-β agonist activity in growth inhibition (20Leal S.M.

DHFR expression is regulated in the cell cycle at the level of transcription (1Santiago C. Collins M. Johnson L.F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1984; 118: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 2Farnham P.J. Schimke R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7675-7680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Farnham P.J. Schimke R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and there is evidence for post-transcriptional regulation during growth phase transitions (4Leys E.J. Kellems R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1981; 1: 961-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 5Kaufman R.J. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell.

It is clear that regulated variations in mRNA stability can produce dramatic changes in mRNA levels without modification in the rate of gene transcription. For DHFR mRNA, the observed increase indhfr transcription during the transition from Goto exponential growth is not sufficient to account for the increase of the mRNA levels under the same conditions (7Noé V. Chen C. Alemany C. Nicolás M. Caragol I. Chasin L.A. Ciudad C.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For this reason, we have examined the role of mRNA stability as a contributor to the relatively low levels of DHFR mRNA seen in resting cells. Toward this end, we have taken advantage of the tetracycline-responsive promoter developed by Gossen and Bujard (8Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar). The tetracycline-responsive system allows for selective inhibition of transcription of the gene under the control of the responsive promoter without affecting the transcription machinery of the cell. Given that the hamster dhfr gene contains multiple polyadenylation sites (9Carothers A.M. Urlaub G. Ellis N. Chasin L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1997-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and that differential polyadenylation (pA) can affect the cell growth regulation of DHFR mRNA (5Kaufman R.J. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 1598-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we have analyzed the role of polyadenylation site usage in the stability of the resultant mRNA molecules. Using tetracycline-responsive dhfrminigenes, we have determined that DHFR mRNA half-life is significantly shorter than previously reported, that DHFR mRNA stability varies according to polyadenylation site usage, and that this mRNA is less stable in serum-starved cells. Conditions for the monolayer culture of CHO cells have been previously described (10Urlaub G. Mitchell P.J. Kas E. Funanage V.L. Myoda T.T. Hamlin J.L. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1986; 12: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). CHO-K1, DG44 (10Urlaub G. Mitchell P.J. Kas E. Funanage V.L. Myoda T.T. Hamlin J.L. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1986; 12: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), and G7 cells (11Ciudad C.J. Urlaub G. Chasin L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16274-16282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in Ham's F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals) and were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2-containing atmosphere. For starvation experiments, 1000 cells were seeded in 35-mm diameter dishes in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 0.2% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubated for 7 days. The starting construct, plasmid pDCH1P11, was constructed by cloning theSmaI–HindIII fragment from hamster minigene pDCH2 (12Venolia L. Urlaub G. Chasin L.A. Somat. Cell Genet. 1987; 13: 491-504Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar), into the SmaI–HindIII sites of the cloning vector pSP72 (Promega). pDCH1P11 contains approximately 400 bp of the promoter region in the dhfr 5′-flank, the DHFR coding sequence including intron 1 as a sole intron, and the first polyadenylation site of the dhfr gene. To constructdhfr minigenes under the control of a modulatable promoter, we used the tetracycline-responsive system described by Gossen and Bujard (8Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar). In this system, a hybrid phage-VP16 transcriptional activator (the tetracycline-responsive transactivator (tTA)), encoded by pUHD15-1 activates transcription of the gene of interest under the control of a chimeric promoter (provided by the vector pUHD10-3), consisting of basal elements of the cytomegalovirus early promoter preceded by operator sequences of the tetracycline resistance gene. In the presence of tetracycline, tTA cannot bind DNA, and the transcription of the subcloned gene is turned off (tet-off). The following dhfr minigenes were constructed. (a) pUD1S contained a 1626-bpAvrII–HindIII fragment from pDCH1P11 cloned into the XbaI site of vector pUHD10-3. By cutting withAvrII, which falls in the 5′-UTR of dhfr, the major transcriptional start of the dhfr gene is excluded. (b) pUD1 lacked the SV40 late polyadenylation sequence contributed by pUHD10-3. pUD1 was constructed by digesting pUD1S withSphI and NarI to remove the region containing the SV40 polyadenylation sequence from the vector, and the protruding ends were blunted with T4 DNA polymerase prior to the ligation. The firstdhfr polyadenylation site (pA1) is retained in pUD1. (c) pUDD1, containing the major transcriptional start site from the hamster dhfr gene promoter. pUD1 was digested withEcoRI to remove a 447-bp fragment extending from theEcoRI site in the polycloning region of the vector to the beginning of dhfr exon 2. A 509-bp fragment fromdhfr minigene pDCH1P11 was PCR-amplified using a 5′ primer of a modified sequence to produce an EcoRI site just upstream of the major transcriptional start of dhfr (5′ DEcoRI, 5′-CGGGCGAATTCAATTTCGCG-3′) and a 3′ primer from a sequence in dhfr exon 2, located downstream of theEcoRI site (3′DEx2, 5′-CACCACCAGTAAGAAACCTTCATG-3′). After digestion of the PCR fragment with EcoRI, the 472-bp product was cloned between the EcoRI sites of pUD1. pUDD1 contains the dhfr promoter region/transcriptional start site and the first dhfr polyadenylation site (pA1). (d) pUDD123 contained all three hamster dhfr polyadenylation sites. pUDD1 was digested with BamHI and HindIII to remove the sequence containing the first polyadenylation site fromdhfr. A 1.4-kilobase pair fragment containing the three polyadenylation sites from dhfr was PCR-amplified from plasmid pMG2 as template (13Mitchell P.J. Carothers A.D. Han J.H. Harding J.D. Kas E. Venolia L. Chasin L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 425-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) using Pwo thermostable polymerase with proofreading activity. The 5′ primer was a sequence containing the BamHI site upstream of the first polyadenylation site (pA1) (5′-GAACCTGGGATCCTGTGCAT-3′), and the 3′ primer was a modified sequence containing a HindIII site downstream of the third dhfr polyadenylation site (pA3) (5′-GGCTCTAAGGGTAAGCTTACTACTGTTG-3′). After digestion of the PCR fragment with BamHI and HindIII, the digested sequence was cloned between the BamHI and HindIII sites of pUDD1. Two micrograms of the tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA) plasmid pUHD15-1 (8Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar) were cotransfected with 0.4 μg of plasmid BPVNeo (14Lusky M. Botchan M.R.

A. 1979; 76: 1373-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar) using calf thymus DNA (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as carrier. After 14 days of selection for G418 resistance (400 μg of the active compound per ml of medium; Life Technologies, Inc.), the surviving colonies were pooled and used as recipient cells (DG44-tTA) for transfection with the tetracycline-responsive dhfr minigenes. Permanent transfectants of dhfr minigenes were obtained by transfecting 0.3, 1, and 3 μg of each construct into DG44-tTA cells by the calcium phosphate method. DHFR selection was performed in Ham's F-12 medium without hypoxanthine supplemented with 7% dialyzed calf serum for 8 days. Several well isolated colonies were then picked using cloning rings. For each construct, nine individual clones (three for each amount of DNA used in the transfection) were analyzed by RT-PCR to determine DHFR mRNA levels in the absence of tetracycline or after 24 h of treatment with a 1 μg/ml concentration of the antibiotic. The transfectant clone of each construct that exhibited a substantial tetracycline response and a high level of DHFR mRNA expression was chosen for further studies. mRNA levels were determined by quantitative RT-PCR using total cell lysates as the starting material for the RT reaction. 5000 cells were plated in 35-mm diameter dishes in Ham's F-12 medium; 15 h later, the cells were treated with tetracycline (1 μg/ml) for different periods of time. After the treatments, the cells were harvested simultaneously by trypsinization, washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 11.25 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. The samples were heated at 80 °C for 5 min and chilled on ice, and the remaining components of the RT reaction were added. cDNA was synthesized in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 125 ng of random hexamers (Promega), 10 mm dithiothreitol, 20 units of RNasin (Promega), 0.5 mm dNTPs (Promega), 4 μl of 5× RT buffer, and 200 units of Superscript RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. Five μl of the cDNA mixture were used directly for PCR amplification. PCR was typically carried out as described (7Noé V. Chen C. Alemany C. Nicolás M. Caragol I. Chasin L.A. Ciudad C.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) using 2 units ofTaq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) for each reaction and [α-32P]dATP to label the PCR product. The primers used were as follows: 5′-AAGAACGGAGACCTTCCCT-3′ (5′DEx1) in exon 1 or 5′- CGCCAAACTTGGGGGAAGCA-3′ (Operon I) in the 5′-UTR in combination with 5′- AGTATCTGAAGTTTAAATAT-3′ (3′DEx6PA) in exon 6 for DHFR mRNA and 5′-GCATGGCGGCAAGATCGACT-3′ (A5′Ex2) in exon 2 and 5′- TCACACACTCCACCACCTCA-3′ (A3′Ex5A) in exon 5 for APRT mRNA, used as an internal control. PCR was performed for 22 cycles after 1-min denaturation at 94 °C; each cycle consisted of denaturation at 92 °C for 30 s, primer annealing at 59 °C for 75 s, and primer extension at 72 °C for 110 s. Five μl of each PCR sample were electrophoresed in a 5% polyacrylamide gel. The gels were dried, and the radioactive bands were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Total RNA was extracted from the different clones using the UltraspecTM RNA reagent (Biotecx) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty μg of total RNA were run in 0.8% formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred to a Zeta-Probe GT blotting membrane (Bio-Rad) using 50 mm NaOH as transfer solution. The blot was hybridized with a DNA probe spanning 859 bp from 199 bp upstream of the first polyadenylation site (pA1) to 162 bp downstream of the second polyadenylation site (pA2) of the hamster dhfr gene, generated by PCR. The PCR product was gel-purified, and 25 ng were32P-labeled using the Prime-a-Gene system (Promega). The hybridization was performed in a solution containing 5× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 5× Denhardt's reagent, 50% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5% dextran sulfate, 100 μg of sonicated herring sperm DNA/ml, and 2 × 106 cpm/ml probe at 42 °C overnight. The blots were washed once in 2× SSC plus 0.1% SDS and once in 1× SSC plus 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 30 min each and dried and exposed to x-ray film. Poly(A) length analysis of the different mRNA species was performed by RT-PCR following the method of Sallés and Strickland (16Sallés F.J. Strickland S. PCR Methods Appl. 1995; 4: 317-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) with modifications. Two μg of total RNA from each clone were used in the RT reaction with 1 μg of primer of an arbitrary sequence followed by oligo(dT)12. The RNA and the primer were heated at 80 °C for 5 min, cooled to room temperature (0.5 °C/min), and then placed at 4 °C. The remaining components of the RT reaction were then added, and cDNA was synthesized in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 10 mm dithiothreitol, 20 units of RNasin (Promega), 0.5 mm dNTPs (Promega), 4 μl of 5× RT buffer, and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The RT reaction was performed for 5 min at 4 °C, 5 min at room temperature, 5 min at 37 °C, and 45 min at 42 °C. Five μl of the RT reaction were then used in the PCR, which was performed with a 5′ primer upstream of either the pA1, pA2, or pA3 site of the dhfr gene and the arbitrary sequence of the RT primer as 3′ primer. PCR was carried out as described above for 30 cycles, and the PCR products were electrophoresed and visualized by autoradiography. The length of the poly(A) tails was determined from the length of the smear of the PCR products. The primer used in the RT reaction was 5′-GCGAGCTCCGCGGCCGCGT12-3′, and the different primers used in the PCR reaction were as follows: 5′-TAGAGAGGGATAGTTAGGAAGATG-3′ upstream of dhfr pA1; 5′-CTCCTTAGAGATGGGAGCAG-3′ upstream ofdhfr pA2 and SV40 pA; 5′-GCTGCTGTGAGCTTGGTGAGT-3′ upstream of dhfr pA3; and 5′-GCGAGCTCCGCGGCCGCG-3′ as the reverse primer. To study the stability of DHFR mRNA, we constructed several versions of dhfr minigenes under the control of a tetracycline-responsive promoter, which is a chimeric promoter consisting of several copies of tet operator sequences from Escherichia coli and the minimal immediate early promoter of human cytomegalovirus (8Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar). The initial step was to establish stable transfectants that produced the tTA in dhfr − CHO DG44 cells. After transfection of DG44 cells with plasmid pUHD15-1, encoding tTA, selection with G418 was applied, and the surviving colonies were pooled. This pool (DG44-tTA) was the recipient in transfections with tetracycline-modulatable dhfr minigenes. In the absence of tetracycline, the hybrid transactivator will specifically stimulate transcription of the promoters containingtet operator sequences. In the presence of the antibiotic, tTA will be unable to bind to the promoter sequences, disabling the transcription of the gene under the control of this promoter. Transfectants that received the tetracycline-responsive dhfrminigenes were selected for DHFR activity in medium lacking hypoxanthine as well as tetracycline and subsequently individual clones (usually nine) were culled. To test for responsiveness to tetracycline inhibition, DHFR mRNA levels in the individual clones were analyzed after growth in the absence or in the presence of 1 μg/ml tetracycline for 24 h. This analysis was performed by quantitative RT-PCR using cell lysates as the starting material. In all cases, the clone showing the highest effectiveness of tetracycline regulation ofdhfr gene expression was chosen for the determination of DHFR mRNA half-life in exponentially growing and serum-starved cells. All of thedhfr constructs contain the complete protein coding sequence for DHFR interrupted by the 300-nt dhfr intron 1 as the only intron; they differ at their 5′ and/or their 3′ ends. The first construct transfected in DG44-tTA cells was pUD1S, which contains the first of the three dhfr polyadenylation sites followed by an SV40 late polyadenylation site. After selection for DHFR activity in medium lacking hypoxanthine, eight individual clones were analyzed for their responsiveness to tetracycline inhibition. All of the clones analyzed were sensitive to tetracycline inhibition (Fig.1 A); clone A3-5 showed the greatest reduction (70-fold) in DHFR mRNA levels and was selected for further studies. The determination of mRNA levels was always performed by RT-PCR directly from cell lysates immediately after each treatment. That this determination is quantitative is shown in Fig.1 B. In this experiment, an increasing number of cells from clone A3-5 were subjected to RT-PCR, and the DHFR mRNA levels were determined by the ratio between the DHFR and APRT radioactive signals, the APRT mRNA being used as an internal endogenous gene control. The correlation coefficient between the number of cells plated and the level of DHFR mRNA detected was 0.98. We proceeded to determine the half-life of DHFR mRNA for clone A3-5 in exponentially growing cells. We performed time course experiments by determining the remaining DHFR mRNA levels in cells treated with 1 μg/ml of tetracycline for different periods of time. After the addition of tetracycline, DHFR mRNA decayed with exponential kinetics over the next 6 h with a half-life of 124 min (Fig.2). APRT mRNA levels, used as an internal control in the RT-PCR, were not affected by the tetracycline treatment. The half-life of DHFR mRNA from pUD1S was also estimated from the time required to achieve a new steady-state level after induction. The half-life of this process after a 2-h lag time was about 2 h in agreement with the decay rate following deinduction (data not shown). The DHFR mRNA half-life in clone A3-5 represented a decay rate about 4 times greater than that measured for the endogenous gene in CHO UA21 cells in the presence of actinomycin D (17Urlaub G. Mitchell P.J. Ciudad C.J. Chasin L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2868-2880Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). We repeated these measurements of the decay rate of endogenous DHFR mRNA in CHO cells in the presence of actinomycin D using our RT-PCR methodology. The DHFR mRNA half-life was 8.5 h (Fig.3) in agreement with the previous determination in CHO UA21 cells by Northern blot analysis. That difference between the tetracycline and the actinomycin D experiments could be due to the modifications in the 5′-UTR and 3′-UTR in the pUD1S minigene with respect to the endogenous gene or to the method used to inhibit transcription. Actinomycin D treatment has been reported to stabilize specific mRNAs against normal degradation (18Chen C-Y.A. Xu N. Shyu A-B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5777-5788Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 19Kessler O. Chasin L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4426-4435Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We therefore measured the decay rate of the DHFR mRNA encoded by the tetracycline-responsive minigene in the presence of actinomycin D. As shown in Fig. 3, actinomycin D stabilized DHFR mRNA in clone A3-5, yielding a half-life of over 11 h, a value 5-fold greater than the half-life determined using tetracycline. In the course of measuring mRNA decay rates in the presence of actinomycin D, we noted that DHFR mRNA produced by adhfr minigene was less stable than that produced by the endogenous gene (Fig. 3). G-7 cells are CHO transfectants carrying thedhfr minigene pDCH1P (11Ciudad C.J. Urlaub G. Chasin L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16274-16282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is driven by thedhfr promoter but contains only the first of the threedhfr polyadenylation sites (9Carothers A.M. Urlaub G. Ellis N. Chasin L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1997-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The half-life of DHFR mRNA in G-7 cells using actinomycin D was 2.6 h (Fig. 3)versus 8.5 for the endogenous gene in CHO cells. This result suggested that the different stability in actinomycin D of the endogenous DHFR mRNA and the mRNA in G-7 cells could reside in the different 3′ ends of the mRNA molecules. The greater DHFR mRNA half-life determined for clone A3-5 using actinomycin D could be due to the presence of the SV40 polyadenylation signal included as part of the original vector. To test the possibility that differences in polyadenylation site usage could be involved in DHFR mRNA stability, we eliminated the sequence that includes the SV40 polyadenylation site in pUD1S. We transfected this new construct, pUD1, that maintained only the first polyadenylation site from the dhfr gene, into the DG44-tTA pool. Following the same methodology as with clone A3-5, clone B1-4 was chosen, since it gave the highest response to tetracycline inhibition ofdhfr gene expression (100-fold). Time course experiments after the addition of tetracycline were performed to determine DHFR mRNA half-life in this clone. As shown in Fig.4, clone B1-4 exhibited a DHFR mRNA half-life of 50 min, compared with 124 min when the SV40 polyadenylation site was present. Thus, deletion of the SV40 polyadenylation site caused a decrease by half in stability of DHFR mRNA. The transcriptional start of the dhfr gene was absent in these tetracycline-responsive minigenes (clones A3-5 and B1-4). With the idea that sequences in the 5′-UTR could affect mRNA stability, we constructed a third minigene that contained the major transcriptional start from the hamster dhfr gene in addition to the first polyadenylation site. This minigene, pUDD1, was transfected into the DG44-tTA pool, and clone C3-1, with the highest response to tetracycline inhibition (54-fold), was chosen to determine DHFR mRNA stability. DHFR mRNA half-life was 39 min in clone C3-1, close to the value of 50 min produced by pUD1 in clone B1-4 (data not shown). Thus, DHFR mRNA was not stabilized by inclusion of 5′-UTR sequences. The endogenous CHO dhfr gene contains three polyadenylation sites (9Carothers A.M. Urlaub G. Ellis N. Chasin L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1997-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) that could be affecting the stability of the resulting mRNA molecules. For this reason, we constructed a fourth minigene, pUDD123, that contains the sequence corresponding to the three polyadenylation sites (pA1, pA2, and pA3) from the hamsterdhfr gene (as well as the dhfr 5′-UTR). This new construct was transfected into the DG44-tTA pool, and clone D3-3, with a 37-fold tetracycline deinduction, was chosen to determine DHFR mRNA stability. As shown in Fig. 5, the DHFR mRNA half-life for this clone was 94 min. The restoration of the three polyadenylation sites from the endogenous dhfrgene increased DHFR mRNA half-life 2-fold with respect to the transfectants containing only the first dhfr polyadenylation sites (39- and 50-min half-lives). To determine the different polyadenylated DHFR mRNAs species generated by each tetracycline-responsive construct, we performed Northern blot analysis of total RNA from the selected clones. As a size reference, we used total RNA from MK42, an amplified CHO cell line that carries multiple copies of the endogenous dhfr gene (20Noé V. Alemany C. Ciudad C.J. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 600-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and produces the three species of DHFR mRNA molecules corresponding to the three different polyadenylation sites present (9Carothers A.M. Urlaub G. Ellis N. Chasin L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1997-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 13Mitchell P.J. Carothers A.D. Han J.H. Harding J.D. Kas E. Venolia L. Chasin L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 425-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, DHFR mRNA molecules in clone A3-5 used the SV40 polyadenylation site provided by the vector. There was no evidence of the use of dhfr pA1, which lies upstream of the SV40 site in pUD1S (see diagramin Fig. 2). When the SV40 site was deleted, which is the case for clones B1-4 and C3-1, the DHFR mRNA produced corresponded to the use of pA1 from the dhfr gene still present in these constructs. In clone D3-3, which included all three dhfrpolyadenylation sites, the detected mRNA species corresponded to those present in MK42 cells. Thus, the mRNA molecules for each minigene corresponded to the sizes expected from the known polyadenylation sites present in the constructs. These results suggested that the observed differences in DHFR mRNA stability were probably due to the different polyadenylation sites used. To determine whether DHFR mRNA stability was affected by the cell growth phase, we analyzed DHFR mRNA half-life for the different constructs in serum-starved cells. Cells from the different clones were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 0.2% fetal calf serum for 7 days; resting cells produced in this way maintained their viability and resume growth synchronously upon serum addition (7Noé V. Chen C. Alemany C. Nicolás M. Caragol I. Chasin L.A. Ciudad C.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The resting cells were then treated with tetracycline for different periods of time to determine the mRNA half-life (Fig. 7). For clone A3-5 (pUD1S, containing pA1 and the SV40 site), the inhibition of DHFR transcription by tetracycline in starved cells was delayed for a period of 2 h (Fig. 7 A). DHFR mRNA half-life was determined in the region of the plot corresponding to the exponential decay, obtaining a value of 60 min. This represents a 2-fold reduction in DHFR mRNA half-life as compared with exponentially growing cells (124-min half-life). For clones B1-4 and C3-1 (containing pA1 only), the DHFR mRNA half-lives in starved cells were 50 min and 37 min, respectively (Fig.8, B and C), not different from the DHFR mRNA half-life in exponentially growing cells (half-lives of 50 min and 39 min, respectively). In starved cells of clone D3-3 (containing pA1, pA2, and pA3), the half-life was 65 min (Fig. 7 D) versus 94 min in exponentially growing cells. These results suggested that the presence of a strong polyadenylation site, such as the SV40 polyadenylation site or the second and/or third polyadenylation sites from the dhfr gene conferred cell growth regulation on DHFR mRNA.Figure 8Poly(A) length of DHFR mRNA in exponentially growing versus starved cells.

The mutant was produced by Ac transposon tagging, and a gene located in the insertion region of the transposon was isolated as well as the corresponding cDNA. The predicted protein contains twenty hydrophobic segments that can be grouped in five repeats formed by four segments that fulfill the criteria for membrane spanning domains, and for this reason the gene has been named TM20. The sequences of the domains in each position of each group can be aligned, indicating that TM20 is formed by a four-domain structure duplicated five times.

Sussex I.M. Patterns in Plant Development. 2nd Ed. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1989Crossref Google Scholar). The process of embryogenesis involves three main phases: pattern formation (early embryogenesis), embryo enlargement and storage product synthesis (mid embryogenesis), and desiccation, dormancy and preparation for germination (late embryogenesis). Whereas knowledge about the regulation of pattern formation and embryogenesis in animals has made rapid advances, the mechanisms that regulate these processes in plants are just beginning to be defined. The most extensive studies in this field have dealt withArabidopsis thaliana and maize, which are the best analyzed examples in the two major groups of flowering plants, monocots and dicots. The general strategy in genetic analysis is to use mutants as tools for the identification of essential genes. In Arabidopsis, many embryo mutants have been isolated and characterized. Recently, some mutations altering embryo development have been characterized at a molecular level (2Shevell D.E. Leu W.M. Gillmor C.S. Xia G. Feldmann K.A. Chua N.H. Cell. 1994; 77: 1051-1062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 3Castle L.A. Meinke D.W. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 25-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 4Lukowitz W.

Nature. 1996; 379: 66-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar), and in some cases the protein encoded by the gene is involved in the formation of the cell wall, an essential step in plant morphogenesis. Besides its worldwide economic importance, maize has several intrinsic advantages which facilitate the study of embryogenesis. The size of the embryo allows isolation from the endosperm at early stages of development. Moreover, the developmental stages of the maize embryo, from one-cell zygote to mature embryo, are well characterized at the morphological level (Refs. 6Randolph L.F. J. Agric. Res. 1936; 53: 881-916Google Scholar, 7Kieselbach T.A. Univ. Nebr. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1949; 161Google Scholar, 8Abbe E.C. Stein O.L. Am. J. Bot. 1954; 41: 285-293Crossref Google Scholar; see the schematic drawing in Fig. 3). The maize zygote divides asymmetrically to generate a small, lenticular terminal cell and a larger basal cell. This two-cell embryo undergoes irregular cell divisions, both in orientation and in sequence, so it is not possible to trace the future organs of the embryo as it has been done in some other plants. The result of these divisions is the formation of a club-shaped embryo (proembryo stage), consisting of two regions, a small celled embryo proper, which lies above a large celled suspensor. The first evidence of differentiation within the embryo proper occurs at the transition stage with the delimitation of the protoderm and the appearance of a wedge-shaped meristematic region within the embryo. At this point, the first evidences of bilateral symmetry appear. Embryo development can be blocked at this stage either by specific mutations (like the one analyzed here) or by placing the embryos in culture conditions that block polar transport of hormones (9Fischer C. Neuhaus G. Plant J. 1996; 9: 659-669Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Recently, new types of transmembrane proteins have been described in Arabidopsis identified from mutants blocking processes such as meristem development or gravitropism that appear to be involved in the hormone efflux processes (10Gälweiler L.

Plant Cell Physiol. 1998; 39: 1111-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Until now none of these genes has been related to embryogenesis. In maize, embryo and endosperm mutants have been identified and characterized (14Sheridan W.F. Neuffer M.G. J. Hered. 1982; 73: 318-329Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 15Sheridan W.F. Clark J.K.

Bios Scientific Publishers, Oxford, UK1996: 89-112Google Scholar). Two main types of embryo mutants are recognized in maize: the defective kernel (dek) mutants, in which both embryo and endosperm are defective, and the embryo-specific (emb) mutants, in which development of the embryo is profoundly altered without disrupting the morphogenesis of the endosperm. The availability of these mutants, together with the collections of maize transposon-tagged stocks, greatly facilitates the study of embryogenesis in maize. Here we describe the characterization of a gene linked to a dek mutation in maize and encoding a new class of transmembrane proteins. Mutant lines were produced by Dr. S. Dellaporta (Yale University) as previously described (20Dellaporta S.L. Moreno S.A. Freeling M. Walbot V. The Maize Handbook. Springer Verlag, New York1994: 219-233Crossref Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant plants were grown in the greenhouse of the Departamento de Genética Molecular (CID-CSIC, Barcelona). Tissue from different parts of wild-type (W64) and lachrima plants was harvested and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was isolated, denatured, and fractionated on a denaturing gel as described by Logemann et al. (21Logemann J. Schell J. Willmitzer L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 163: 16-20Google Scholar) and transferred to a nylon membrane (Nytran, Schleicher and Schuell) using 20× SSC as transfer buffer. Maize genomic DNA was isolated as described by Chen and Dellaporta (22Chen J. Dellaporta S. Freeling M. Walbot V. The Maize Handbook. Springer Verlag, New York1994: 526-527Crossref Google Scholar), and transferred under alkaline conditions onto Nytran (Schleicher and Schuell) following the protocol of the manufacturer. Northern and Southern blots were fixed, hybridized, and washed as described by Church and Gilbert (23Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7266) Google Scholar). Probes were labeled by the random priming method (Random Primed DNA Labeling Kit, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Germany), following the protocols of the manufacturer. General recombinant DNA techniques were performed as described by Sambrook et al.(24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). All the genomic and cDNA libraries were made according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The partial EcoRI genomic library of lachrima mutant DNA was made in λZapII vector and screened with the central 0.9-kb1 EcoRI/HindIII fragment of the Ac element. After partial Sau3A restriction of W64 genomic DNA, a genomic library was generated in λDASHII and screened with the DNA fragment flanking the Ac element. A cDNA library from 12 days after pollination (DAP) embryos was directionally constructed in the EcoRI 5′ toXhoI 3′ λZapII vector and screened with the coding region deduced from the genomic clone. The remaining sequence of the cDNA was obtained using the 5′-RACE technique (Life Technologies, Inc.). DNA sequencing was performed using automatic fluorescent sequencing (ALF, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Analysis of the predicted protein sequence of TM20 was carried out using the BLAST network server (25Altshul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71436) Google Scholar) and the GCG sequence analysis software package (Madison, Wisconsin). The hydropathy profile has been obtained using the DNAStar package (Lasergene Inc., Madison, WI) that follows the Kyte and Doolittle algorithm (29Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17287) Google Scholar). A 19-amino acid window was used for the analysis. Fixation of the embryos and kernels was done in ethanol:formaldehyde:acetic acid (80:3.5:5) for 1 h at room temperature. Once the fixative was removed, the samples could be stored in 70% ethanol at 4 °C indefinitely. Embedding, sectioning, and pretreatment of the tissues was performed as described by Langdale (26Langdale J.A. Freeling M. Walbot V. The Maize Handbook. Springer Verlag, New York1994: 165-180Crossref Google Scholar). Riboprobes, hybridization, washes, blocking, and antibody incubation and detection were done according to the instructions of the manufacturer (RNA Color Kit for nonradioactive in situhybridization, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Digoxigenin-labeled hybrids were viewed using bright field microscopy and photographed using Kodak Ektachrome 160 film. Maize embryos and kernels were prepared for scanning electron microscopy analysis following the procedure of Irish and Sussex (27Irish V.F. Sussex I.M. Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 741-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Fixation of the samples was performed as for in situhybridization. After the dehydration series, the 100% ethanol solution was removed and replaced by isoamyl acetate, 100% ethanol, 1:2 (10 min); isoamyl acetate, 100% ethanol, 1:1 (10 min); isoamyl acetate, 100% ethanol, 2:1; and isoamyl acetate (3 × 10 min). Dehydrated material was critical point dried in liquid CO2 and examined in a Hitachi S2300 scanning electron microscope from Serveis Cientı́fico-Tècnics (Universitat de Barcelona). Using the strategy of gene tagging by theActivator (Ac) transposon (20Dellaporta S.L. Moreno S.A. Freeling M. Walbot V. The Maize Handbook. Springer Verlag, New York1994: 219-233Crossref Google Scholar), a dek(defective kernel) mutation associated with an Ac transposition event was isolated. This dek mutation is a recessive embryo-lethal mutation. Segregation analysis of this mutant line shows a complete cosegregation between the mutant phenotype and a transposed Ac element as seen by Southern blot. Although several copies of sequences that hybridize to Ac probes are present in all maize lines, the dek phenotype segregates with a unique Ac element that is not present in the parental DNA line, appearing as a 3.2-kb EcoRI fragment in Southern blots (Fig.1 I, panel A). More than 100 plants were analyzed in this fashion, and Fig. 1 I,panel A, is an example of the Southern blot obtained. Thedek mutant kernels always possessed an Ac element in homozygosis, whereas heterozygote kernels had just one copy of this Ac element. The Ac was never found in homozygous wild-type sibling kernels (Fig. 1 I, panel B). These results indicate that the 3.2-kb EcoRI fragment is associated with an Ac element linked to this dek mutation. The dek mutant was named lachrima because of the tear-drop shape of the embryo at seed maturity (Fig. 1 II,panel C). Mutant kernels are first distinguishable because of their smaller size at about 10 DAP for our summer material and about 12 DAP for our winter greenhouse material (Fig. 1 II,panel A). They remain retarded in kernel growth and in both their embryo and endosperm development until kernel maturity, when compared with normal embryos from the same ear. The mutant embryos have a symmetrical appearance, indicating that they have been uniformly blocked at the mid-transition stage of embryogenesis. After reaching this stage, the mutant embryos undergo little morphological change, slightly increasing in size while maintaining a uniform and healthy appearance until late in kernel development (Fig. 1 II,panels B and C). No evidence of bilateral symmetry may be observed, but the basis of the embryo proper enlarges as well as the suspensor giving rise to the characteristic tear-drop phenotype. Full description of the developmental pattern of the mutation will be described elsewhere. A partial library was constructed from genomic DNA from a plant line heterozygous forlachrima. The library was screened using an Ac probe, and one clone was recovered that contained a single 3.2-kb EcoRI fragment which hybridized with the Ac probe and comigrated with theEcoRI fragment in lachrima genomic DNA (data not shown). The DNA sequence flanking the Ac insertion was sequenced and determined to be single copy by Southern blot. It was then used as a probe to screen for wild-type (W64A) genomic and cDNA clones. A phage containing the wild-type genomic DNA was isolated, and 10 kb of the insert were sequenced. Different fragments of the wild-type genomic clone were used as probes in RNA blots (not shown), and only a region adjacent to the transposon insertion site hybridized with embryo RNA. This region is the only one within the 10 kb sequenced having a long open-reading frame and with a GC content typical of maize coding regions. For the reasons described below, this gene was calledTM20. A cDNA library constructed from poly(A)+ RNA obtained from immature maize embryos 12 days after pollination was also screened. Several cDNA clones were detected, and the one carrying the longest insert (1.7 kb) was analyzed. Southern blot analysis at high stringency using this cDNA as a probe showed that there was a single copy of the TM20 sequence in the maize genome (Fig.2, panel C). RNA blot analysis with the same cDNA probe shows that the cDNA hybridizes to a 4.4-kb band, indicating that the cDNA isolated was not the complete transcript (Fig. 2, panel B). The analysis of hybridization of the genomic sequence with the cDNA indicates that a 5-kb genomic fragment contains the entire coding sequence of the TM20gene. The information from the genomic sequence was used to clone the rest of the TM20 cDNA. Two fragments that constituted the remainder of the TM20 cDNA were obtained by using RACE. The complete cDNA is 4461 nucleotides long (see Fig. 4). This size is consistent with RNA blot analysis that shows an mRNA band of 4.4 kb.Figure 4Sequence of the TM20 cDNA and predicted amino acid sequence.

RNA blots containing RNA from wild-type maize embryos, kernels, seedling tissues, and adult tissues were hybridized with a probe covering the TM20 coding sequence. On the blots, this probe detects a single band of about 4.4 kb. In the RNA blot presented in Fig. 2, panel A, TM20 mRNA is shown to be present in all the tissues examined but to vary greatly in abundance in the different tissues examined. TM20 mRNA is most abundant during early embryo development, whereas lower levels of mRNA accumulation are detectable in mid and late embryogenesis and in more adult tissues (Fig. 2, panel A). We also determined the expression of TM20 gene in mutant and heterozygotelachrima kernels. TM20 gene appears to be expressed at similar levels in both wild-type and heterozygotes, whereas no transcripts are detected in lachrima mutants (Fig. 2, panel B). To define precisely the spatial and temporal pattern of TM20gene expression during embryo development, we localized theTM20 mRNA by in situ hybridization to different embryo sections representing embryos from proembryo to stage 3 of development (Fig. 3 III,panels A–F). In Fig. 3 I, a schematic representation of the different stages and sections is shown.TM20 gene is expressed very early in kernel development. Approximately 40 h after pollination, the zygote undergoes its first division, while the endosperm has around 20 free nuclei. At this stage, TM20 transcripts are localized in the embryo cells, at the placental region of the kernel, and around the endosperm nuclei (Fig. 3 III, panel A). About 4 DAP, wall formation begins in the endosperm, and the proembryo commonly has about a dozen cells. Subsequently, the TM20 gene is still expressed in the placental region and in the embryo and peripheral endosperm cells (Fig.3 III, panels B and C). Later in embryo development, around 10 DAP, TM20 gene expression begins to be restricted to the embryo. From 12 to 20 DAP, TM20 RNA accumulation is detected in meristematic centers of the embryo (Fig.3 III, panels D and E). At the shoot region of the embryo axis, TM20 RNA is localized in the leaf primordia and around the provascular cells of the coleoptile procambium (Fig. 3 III, panel D). At the node region, TM20mRNA is also localized in the meristematic and provascular cells of the embryo axis. In the root primordia, TM20 gene expression is detected in actively proliferating cells, which occur in the pericycle and in the provascular elements of the primordial root (Fig.3 III, panel E). In the scutellum, TM20 RNA is detected in the provascular strands, and in the subepidermal layers, forming a short gradient toward the embryo axis. These results indicate that TM20 gene expression is associated with tissues undergoing proliferation. The complete genomic and cDNA clones were sequenced (GenBankTM/EBI accession number X97570, Fig.4). Full agreement was found between the two sequences, indicating that there are no introns in theTM20 sequence. The genomic sequence also matches the one obtained in the mutant strain which has the Ac transposon insertion 5′ to the starting point of the cDNA (see schematic drawing in Fig.5, panel A). The cDNA and the deduced protein sequence are shown on Fig. 4. In the 3′ untranslated sequence, several putative polyadenylation signals were found, as is normally the case in plant genes. The single open reading frame in the sequence has 1389 amino acids, encoding a putative 177-kDa protein. Neither the DNA nor the protein sequences showed any significant similarity to others found in the EBI or GenBankTM data bases. Analysis of the deduced protein sequence indicates that it contains a number of hydrophobic domains (indicated in Fig. 4), most of them exhibiting the properties expected for membrane spanning segments (28Klein P. Kanehisa M. DeLisi C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 815: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). These domains are better seen in a hydropathy plot of the sequence (29Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17287) Google Scholar) as shown in Fig. 5,panel B. The twenty hydrophobic domains in TM20 protein sequence can be grouped in five homologous classes of four domains, and therefore they are termed A1 to A4, B1 to B4, etc. This structure can be observed in the hydropathy plot, and it is confirmed from the similarity existing between the different domains. Indeed, the protein sequences of domains A1, B1, C1, D1, and E1 can be aligned, and the same is true for most of the other sequences in the respective positions (not shown). This result may allow proposing that the basic unit of the protein is a four-domain transmembrane element that is tandemly repeated five times. A hydrophobic domain is also present in the N terminus of the protein as well as in the middle of a hydrophilic domain present in the central part of the protein. Five regions containing consensus sequences for phosphorylation by protein kinase C are found after each one of the hydrophobic domains placed in third position (see Fig. 4), and twelve putative N-glycosylation sequences are also present, distributed throughout the sequence. A possible model for the structure of the protein is shown in Fig. 5, panel C, where the putative transmembrane and hydrophilic domains and the glycosylation sites are shown. Different mutations arresting embryo or kernel development at defined stages have been described (16Sheridan W.F. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 353-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 19Clark J.K. Wang T.L. Cuming A. Plant Embryogenesis. Bios Scientific Publishers, Oxford, UK1996: 89-112Google Scholar) in maize, but no molecular data are available about genes involved in these mutations. We report here the characterization of a gene coding for a new transmembrane protein, TM20, that is tightly linked to and its expression inhibited by a new defective kernel (lachrima) mutation that appears necessary for the passage through the transition stage of embryogenesis. The uniform blockage of the embryos at the proembryo/transition stage border of embryogenesis indicates that the function of the lachrima gene is required for processes leading to the acquisition of an asymmetric embryo and to the formation of the shoot apex and the coleoptilar primordium. The function oflachrima is also important in the formation of a normal endosperm because the mutation produces an altered phenotype in both embryo and endosperm development. The mutation here analyzed is produced by the insertion of an Ac transposon in the maize genome, and this fact has allowed us to clone a gene coding for a new type of transmembrane protein named TM20. Although maize is an excellent system for genetics studies, only a limited number of embryo mutations are available and less so alleles of a given mutation. This fact does not allow us to conclude beyond the complete genetic linkage between the lachrima andTM20, although the mutation inhibits the expression of theTM20 gene. This fact allows us in any case to conclude on the involvement of the TM20 protein in the developmental processes blocked by lachrima. Higher plants develop with little change in cell shape and without cell migration. Therefore, the precise molecular mechanisms responsible for plant cell differentiation have to be coordinated with a precisely controlled pattern of cell division and depend on cell-cell communication in a position-dependent manner (30Jürgens G. Cell. 1995; 81: 467-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The spatial and temporal pattern of TM20 gene expression during embryo development is restricted to a population of cells active in cell division in the meristematic regions. TM20 transcripts are detected from the very first cell divisions that occur in the endosperm and in the embryo. During the next embryo developmental stages, TM20 expression remains associated with the newly appearing embryo structures. Later in embryo development, during mid and late embryogenesis, the level of TM20 mRNA accumulation decreases considerably. Taken together, these results suggest that TM20 may be involved in the process of differentiation during early embryo development. Judging from the lack of similarity to known sequences, TM20 does not belong to any of the previously described classes of proteins. However, from the deduced protein sequence, 20 hydrophobic segments having the properties for transmembrane domains can be found, indicating that TM20 protein may be a complex transmembrane protein. Besides these 20 segments, a hydrophobic sequence is present at the N terminus and is a possible candidate for a targeting sequence or signal peptide. A central hydrophobic domain is also found within a 310-residues-long region, having in average a hydrophilic character, features that could allow the interaction of the protein with extracellular components. The other 20 hydrophobic domains can be grouped in five groups formed by four putative transmembrane elements. The segments in an equivalent position in every group can be aligned, indicating a similar function for the five repeated groups. At the end of the third element, a sequence having the consensus for a residue phosphorylated by protein kinase C is found. Multiple (12Müller A. Guan C. Gälweiler L. Tänzler P. Huijser P. Marchant A. Parry G. Bennett M. Wisman E. Palme K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6903-6911Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar) potential glycosylation sites are found along the sequence, indicating that the mature protein may be heavily modified. This type of protein may have relatively low sequence requirements with the exception of the central region. This fact may explain the lack of homologous sequences found using normal homology programs when searching through the data bases. A model of the TM20 protein may be proposed as shown in Fig. 5, panel C. Different proteins with multiple transmembrane domains have been described in different systems, and they frequently function as channels or transporters across the cell membrane (31Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cell. 1992; 69: 715-718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). A family of proteins having four transmembrane segments, the connexins, have been described, and they allow the formation of gap junctions in animal cells (32Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. Cell. 1996; 84: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1652) Google Scholar). A protein having similarity to animal connexins has been described in Arabidopsis (33Meiners S. Xu A. Schindler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4119-4122Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, TM20 lacks an important feature of these proteins: a number of cysteine residues important for the establishment of the junction from one cell to another. It has also been shown that when placing wheat immature embryos in culture in the presence of either an excess of auxin or auxin transport inhibitors, the embryo is blocked at the same stage of development as thelachrima mutation blocks embryogenesis (9Fischer C. Neuhaus G. Plant J. 1996; 9: 659-669Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These results indicate that an appropriate flux of hormones has to be established in the embryo to proceed from the transition stage and to allow the definition of bilateral symmetry. Recently, a number of new transmembrane proteins have been cloned and have been related to auxin transport. They are AGR, EIR1, and AtPIN2 from Arabidopsis, genes that are involved in gravitropism (11Luschnig C. Gaxiola R.A. Grisafi P. Fink G.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2175-2187Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 12Müller A. Guan C. Gälweiler L. Tänzler P. Huijser P. Marchant A. Parry G. Bennett M. Wisman E. Palme K.

Plant Cell Physiol. 1998; 39: 1111-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and AtPIN2, which has been proposed to be a component of the auxin efflux (10Gälweiler L. Guan C. Müller A. Wisman E. Mendgen K. Yephremov A. Palme K. Science. 1998; 282: 2226-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). TM20 shares with these proteins the presence of a central hydrophilic domain and a number (five in Arabidopsis) of transmembrane domains before and after it. No similarity of sequence can be found between these proteins and TM20 and between rice ESTs similar to the Arabidopsis proteins and TM20, but altogether they seem to form a new class of transmembrane proteins. Whether they all form a new large family of hormone transporters in plants is a question that the availability of theTM20 gene may allow to be addressed. We thank Dr. Stephen L. Dellaporta for providing the mutants seeds tagged with Ac, Dr. William F. Sheridan (University of North Dakota) for valuable suggestions, and Dr. Carol Rivin for a critical revision of the manuscript.

In order to further study the mechanism and regulation of expression of SP-A, transfection analysis of additional 5′-flanking regions of the mouse SP-A gene was undertaken. In the present study, a Myb-binding site (MBS) was identified at position −380 to −371 of the murine SP-A gene, mapping closely to four distinct TTF-1 binding sites at positions −159 to −120. Site specific mutation of the MBS, co-transfection analyses, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) demonstrated that B-Myb increased transcription of transfected murine SP-A gene constructs by binding to the MBS. Co-transfection of cyclin A and cdk-2 with B-myb, known to mediate phosphorylation of B-Myb, resulted in markedly enhanced SP-A transcription. The data support the hypothesis that B-Myb regulates transcription of the mouse SP-A gene. SP-A constructs used in this study are presented in Fig. 1. The murine SP-A gene promoter sequences −256 to +45 used to create pCPA0.3 and pCPA0.3T-1,3,4 were isolated and cloned as described previously (15Bruno M.D. Bohinski R.J. Huelsman K.M. Whitsett J.A.

Sequences from −520 were cloned by utilizing the BamHI site present at this position to generate pCPA0.6. To create pCPA0.45 and pCPA0.45M, a 22-base pair oligonucleotide was used to generate a PCR product extending from −399 to +45.

The Myb-binding site mutation was created (pCPA0.45M) by changing two nucleotides within the PCR oligonucleotide used to generate pCPA0.45 (Fig. 3). The mutants, pCPA0.6T-1,3,4, pCPA0.45T-1,3,4, and pCPA0.45MT, were generated by restriction enzyme digestion of a unique BstE11 site within pCPA0.3T-1,3,4.

For B-Myb trans-activation experiments in HeLa cells, each 10-cm dish was treated with a precipitate prepared by using 7.5 pmol of promoter-CAT fusion plasmid, 4 pmol of pCMV/β-gal, and 8 pmol of either the empty expression vector (pKC4) or an expression vector containing the entire B-myb open reading frame (pKC-B-myb, a gift from Dr. R. Watson, Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine, London, United Kingdom). Precipitates from trans-activation experiments including cyclin A (pCMV/cyclin A) and cdk-2 (pCMV/cdk-2) were prepared with 2 pmol of each expression plasmid in the presence or absence of pKC-B-myb. Cells were maintained at 37 °C for 48 h and the lysates were assayed for β-galactosidase and CAT activities as described previously (15Bruno M.D. Bohinski R.J. Huelsman K.M. Whitsett J.A. Korfhagen T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6531-6536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). MLE-15 and HeLa nuclear extracts were prepared using a modified mini-extract procedure. Nuclear extraction procedures were performed in the cold with ice-cold reagents. Confluent monolayers from six, 10-cm diameter dishes were washed twice with 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2), harvested by scraping into 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells pelleted in a chilled 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube at 3,000 rpm for 5 min. The pellet was washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and re-pelleted as described above. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 packed cell volume of fresh (lysis) buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl-fluoride), and the cells were lysed during a 5-min incubation with occasional vortexing. A nuclear pellet was obtained by microcentrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 5 min which was resuspended in 1 packed nuclear volume of fresh (extract) buffer B (20 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mmDTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Nuclear extracts used in Western blot analysis were incubated as above in the presence of 5 mm sodium fluoride and 0.4 mmNa3VO4 to inhibit phosphatases. Nuclei were extracted during a 10-min incubation with occasional gentle vortexing. Extracted nuclei were pelleted in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant recovered was saved as the extracted nuclear protein. These nuclear extracts were quick frozen and stored at −80 °C. Single-stranded oligonucleotides were annealed at 10 mm in 100 μl annealing buffer M (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl) in a 95 °C dry heat block and then slowly cooled to room temperature. The A 260 was determined and dilutions of this mixture were made in TE (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). These double-stranded oligomers were either used directly as cold competitors in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) or gel purified for labeling. For use as a probe in the EMSA, 20 μl of the annealed oligomer was gel purified using a 4% Bio-Gel and a MERmaid kit as specified by the manufacturer (BIO 101, Inc.). TheA 260 was determined and 1.5 pmol of annealed and gel-purified oligonucleotide was end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. End-labeled probe was purified from unincorporated nucleotide using a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Nick Column and recovered in 400 μl of TE. Nuclear extracts (5.0–10.0 μg of protein) and unlabeled oligonucleotide competitor DNA were preincubated in 12.5 μl of EMSA buffer C (12 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 4 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 75 ng/ml poly(dI-dC) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 0.2 mm fresh phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 10 min on ice. Oligonucleotide probe (100,000 dpm) was added to the mixture and incubated an additional 20 min on ice. To detect supershift of protein-DNA complex, B-myb polyclonal antibody was added and incubated an additional 15 min on ice. The protein-DNA complexes were resolved from free probe by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Five percent gels (29:1, acrylamide/bisacrylamide; 0.5 × TBE (44.5 mm Tris, 44.5 mm borate, 1 mmEDTA, pH 8.3); 2.5% (v/v) glycerol; 1.5 mm thick) were run in 0.5 × TBE running buffer at constant current (30 mA) for approximately 90 min. Gels were blotted to Whatman 3MM paper, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. RT-PCR reactions were performed according to the Perkin-Elmer XL RNA PCR Kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Total MLE-15 cell RNA at 0.5 μg/reaction was reverse transcribed at 65 °C for 1 h. Annealing temperature for all oligonucleotides used in the PCR reactions was 60 °C. Oligonucleotides used were as follows for murine B-myb, forward primer 1382–1403: AAGCGACAGAAGAAACGGCGTG, backward primer 2606–2583: ACAGTGTACCAACAGGAGACGAGG. Murine C-myb, forward primer 799–821: ATCTCCAGTCACGTTCCCTATCC, backward primer 2020–2000: CACGCTGAGGAGCCATGTGTC. Protein samples were subjected to Tris glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 10–20% gradient gels and transblotted to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad), then blocked with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 (TBE-T) containing 5% bovine serum albumin for 10 min at RT. B-Myb antibody (a gift from Dr. R. Lewis, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE) was diluted 1:5000 in TBE-T and incubated with blots at 4 °C overnight with constant agitation. Blots were washed three times for 10 min in TBE-T, then incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Calbiochem) at a dilution of 1:10,000 in TBE-T for 3 h at room temperature. After washing three times with TBE-T for 10 min, bound B-Myb antibody was detected by ECL chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham). Means, medians, and standard derivations were calculated from percent conversions of unacetylated to acetylated chloramphenicol from each CAT assay using Sigma Stat for Windows (Jandel Corp., San Rafael, CA). Because the mean and median values reflected non-Gaussian distribution, nonparametric statistical analysis of medians was performed using the Mann-Whitney test. Tissue sections used for in situ hybridization were prepared as described previously (22Zhou L. Dey C.R. Wert S.E. Whitsett J.A. Dev. Biol. 1996; 175: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). To detect B-myb, 30-base pair oligomers were prepared and labeled using the oligonucleotide 3′-end labeling system, NEP-100 (NEN Life Science Products Inc.) according to the manufacturer's methods. Sequence was sense TGTGAAGGAGGAGAGCAGCGAGGAGGAGAT, and antisense ATCTCCTCCTCGCTGCTCTCCTCCTTCACA, position 841–870 of the mouse B-myb cDNA (23Lam E.W.F. Robinson C. Watson R.J. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1885-1890PubMed Google Scholar). To detect SP-A, the cDNA probe and methods were used as described previously (24Korfhagen T.R. Bruno M.D. Glasser S.W. Ciraolo P.J. Whitsett J.A. Lattier D.L. Wikenheiser K.A. Clark J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: L546-L554PubMed Google Scholar). For detection of transcripts with the oligomer probes, following a 37 °C incubation in 2 × SSC, 1 mm DTT for 30 min, washes were at room temperature in 2 × SCC, 1 mm DTT, then 1 × SSC, 1 mm DTT, 2 times, then 0.5 × SSC, 1 mmDTT, 3 times. Type II cells were prepared from adult mouse lungs as described previously (25Corti M. Brody A.R. Harrison J.H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) and Northern blot analyses were performed as described previously (24Korfhagen T.R. Bruno M.D. Glasser S.W. Ciraolo P.J. Whitsett J.A. Lattier D.L. Wikenheiser K.A. Clark J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: L546-L554PubMed Google Scholar). A schematic presentation of elements in the 5′ region of the mouse SP-A gene is provided by Fig.1. Mutations in TTF-1-binding sites TBE-1,3,4, in a construct containing SP-A gene sequences from −256 to +45 markedly inhibited transcriptional activity after transfection in MLE-15 cells (Fig. 2 B; pCPA0.3T-1,3,4) consistent with previous findings (15Bruno M.D. Bohinski R.J. Huelsman K.M. Whitsett J.A. Korfhagen T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6531-6536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, when the same mutations were introduced into a SP-A construct containing additional 5′-flanking sequences of the SP-A gene (either −520 to +45 (pCPA0.6) or −399 to +45 (pCPA0.45)) a 3-fold enhancement of transcriptional activity was detected (Fig. 2 B,pCPA0.45T-1,3,4 and pCPA0.6T-1,3,4). The enhanced level of transcriptional activity caused by the TBE-1,3,4 mutations was similar in pCPA0.45T-1,3,4 or pCPA0.6T-1,3,4 (Fig. 2). Taken together, these findings suggested that a stimulatory cis-acting element was located within sequences from −399 to −256 whose activity was influenced by TTF-1 binding at the previously identified TTF-1-binding sites. To identify candidate cis-active sites influencing transcription of the SP-A gene within this region, we compared the nucleotide sequences from −399 to −256 of the mouse and rat SP-A gene (24Korfhagen T.R. Bruno M.D. Glasser S.W. Ciraolo P.J. Whitsett J.A. Lattier D.L. Wikenheiser K.A. Clark J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: L546-L554PubMed Google Scholar, 26Lacaze-Masmonteil T. Fraslon C. Bourbon J. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The region between −403 and −371 of the mouse gene was 90% homologous to the rat and contained a myb-binding site which binds the mybfamily of transcription factors (Fig. 3). To determine whether the MBS influenced SP-A gene transcription, MLE-15 cells were transfected with the SP-A-CAT constructs containing the MBS mutation depicted in Fig. 3. Mutation of the MBS in the context of the TBE-1,3,4 mutations inhibited but did not completely abolish transcriptional activity, reducing it to about the level of the wild type pCPA0.45 SP-A construct (Fig.4 A, compare pCPA0.45 and pCPA0.45MT) suggesting that the MBS acted as an enhancer and that other unidentified cis-active sites may also be present in the region −399 to −256. In the wild type SP-A promoter (with intact TTF-1-binding sites), mutation of the MBS reduced activity about 50% (Fig.4 A, compare pCPA0.45 with pCPA0.45M). In MLE-15 cells, SP-A activity in constructs with TTF-1 site mutations were 3-fold higher than the wild type construct (compare pCPA0.45T-1,3,4 and pCPA0.45) and mutation of the MBS markedly reduced activity of the pCPA0.45-T-1,3,4 construct (compare pCPA0.45-MT and pCPA0.45-T-1,3,4; Fig.4 A). Thus the MBS was most active in the context of the TBE-1,3,4 mutations and the MBS mutation reduced transcriptional activity of both the wild type and the SP-A promoter with TBE mutations. B-myb mRNA has been detected in the lung (27Tashiro N. Takemoto Y. Handa H. Ishii S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1699-1707PubMed Google Scholar) and in bronchiolar cells (28Lee H.-Y. Dohi D.F. Kim Y.-H. Walsh G.L. Consoli U. Andreeff M. Dawson M.I. Hong W.K. Kurie J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1012-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). C-myb mRNA was previously detected in respiratory epithelial cells (29Sitzmann J. Noben-Trauth K. Klempnauer K.H. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2273-2279PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether myb family members were expressed in cells expressing SP-A, RT-PCR was performed on total RNA prepared from MLE-15 cells. B-myb, but not C-myb mRNA, was readily detected in MLE-15 cells (Fig.5 A). Western blot analyses of MLE-15 nuclear proteins with an anti-B-Myb antibody (Fig.5 B) confirmed the presence of B-Myb. B-mybtranscripts were detected in bronchiolar cells that also contain SP-A transcripts (Fig. 6). B-mybtranscripts were also detected in isolated mouse Type II cells when they were placed in culture while cells were still expressing SP-A (data not shown).Figure 6B-myb transcripts in SP-A expressing cells. To detect cells expressing B-myb and SP-A, in situ hybridization was performed on serial sections of adult lungs. B-myb transcripts were detected in distal bronchiolar cells (Panel A) while SP-A transcripts were detected in distal bronchiolar cells and in alveolar cells in a distribution consistent with Type II cells (Panel B).Panel C is a sense control for B-myb, andPanel D is a corresponding brightfield photomicrograph. A bronchiole is marked with “B.” Arrows depict B-myb expressing cells and arrowheads depict SP-A expressing cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine if nuclear proteins from MLE-15 cells bound to the SP-A MBS, EMSA was performed with an oligonucleotide from positions −383 to −371 of the mouse SP-A gene. Nuclear extracts from MLE-15 cells formed a single, prominent band with the MBS as detected by EMSA. Binding to the element was inhibited by unlabeled self-oligonucleotides and by an MBS from the human adenosine deaminase gene (30Ess K.C. Whitaker T.L. Cost G.J. Witte D.P. Hutton J.J. Aronow B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5707-5715Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) (Fig.7 A). An oligonucleotide containing a mutation in the MBS of the SP-A gene competed poorly for nuclear protein binding to the wild type oligonucleotide (Fig.7 A). Antibody to B-Myb (BM-2) caused the appearance of a supershifted band in EMSA with MLE-15 nuclear extracts and the MBS from the SP-A gene sequences (Fig. 7 B). To determine whether B-Myb trans-activates SP-A sequences containing the MBS, the pCPA0.45 SP-A construct was co-transfected with a B-mybexpression plasmid in HeLa cells. Transcriptional activity of pCPA0.45 was relatively weak in HeLa cells, however, B-Myb increased activity approximately 3-fold (Fig. 8). B-Myb has been previously shown to be phosphorylated when co-transfected with cyclin A and cdk-2 (31Saville M.K. Watson R.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2679-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 32Robinson C. Light Y. Groves R. Mann D. Marais R. Watson R. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1855-1864PubMed Google Scholar, 33Ziebold U.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2445-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Co-transfection of the pCPA0.45-CAT construct with the B-myb expression plasmid and plasmids expressing cyclin A and cdk-2 markedly enhanced activity. While co-transfection of cyclin A and cdk-2 alone slightly enhanced activity of pCPA0.45, co-transfection of B-myb, cyclin A, and cdk-2 enhanced transcriptional activity of the SP-A construct more than 20-fold (Fig. 8) in HeLa cells. In MLE-15 cells, transcriptional enhancement with B-myb was approximately 2-fold, most likely due to the presence of excess B-Myb saturating available cis-active sites, preventing further enhancement (data not shown). TTF-1 binds to four distinct binding sites (TBE) located at positions −159 to −120 in the mouse SP-A gene. TBE-1,3,4 site-specific mutations in SP-A sequences from −256 to +45 markedly reduced transcriptional activity whereas the same mutations tested in a construct consisting of nucleotides −399 to +45, enhanced transcriptional activity, revealing a context specific inhibitory effect of the TTF-1-binding sites. The enhancement of transcription detected in the presence of the TBE mutations of the murine SP-A gene is dependent on protein-DNA interactions in sequences from −399 to −256, and at least a portion of the transcriptional activity related to this region is mediated by B-Myb binding to an MBS consensus element within this region. Activation of the SP-A promoter by B-Myb was markedly enhanced by co-transfection with cdk-2 and cyclin A kinase. Co-transfection of cdk-2 and cyclin A have been previously shown to phosphorylate B-Myb (31Saville M.K. Watson R.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2679-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 32Robinson C. Light Y. Groves R. Mann D. Marais R. Watson R. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1855-1864PubMed Google Scholar, 33Ziebold U.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2445-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), suggesting that phosphorylation of B-Myb enhanced its activity on the SP-A promoter. Activity of MBS was influenced by TTF-1-binding elements located 3′ to themyb-binding site within the 5′-flanking region of the mouse SP-A gene. The murine pulmonary adenocarcinoma cell line, MLE-15, used in this study expressed B-Myb protein and mRNA, consistent with a role for B-Myb in the regulation of SP-A gene expression. Nuclear proteins of MLE-15 cells bound to oligonucleotides containing the MBS and protein binding was competed with a known MBS from the adenosine deaminase gene. An antibody to B-Myb generated a supershifted band on EMSA with MLE-15 nuclear extracts. Mutation of the MBS decreased transcriptional activity of both the wild type (about 50%) and the SP-A constructs with TBE mutations (about 3-fold) in MLE-15 cells, demonstrating that MBS enhances activity of the SP-A promoter. Thus endogenous B-Myb binds to the SP-A MBS enhancing SP-A promoter activity in MLE-15 cells. B-Myb is expressed widely in vertebrate cells and its expression is closely linked to the cell cycle. B-Myb concentrations are increased in proliferating cells (23Lam E.W.F. Robinson C. Watson R.J. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1885-1890PubMed Google Scholar, 35Lam E.W.F. Watson R.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 36Sitzmann J. Noben-Trauth K. Klempnauer K.H. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1889-1894PubMed Google Scholar). Since A, B, and C mybfamily members have been identified in the lung, it is presently unclear which family members mediate SP-A expression in vivo. B-Myb has been identified in human bronchiolar cells (28Lee H.-Y. Dohi D.F. Kim Y.-H. Walsh G.L. Consoli U. Andreeff M. Dawson M.I. Hong W.K. Kurie J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1012-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and both B-Myb and C-Myb have been identified in other respiratory epithelial cells, while A-Myb has been detected in the basal layer of the olfactory epithelium (29Sitzmann J. Noben-Trauth K. Klempnauer K.H. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2273-2279PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, B-Myb was readily detected in MLE-15 cells, a model cell line of the distal respiratory epithelium. B-Myb enhances expression of target genes by interactions of its N-terminal domains with the MBS or other unidentified binding sites (for review, see Refs. 33Ziebold U. Bartsch O. Marais R. Ferrari S. Klempnauer K.H. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 253-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 34Lane S. Farlie P. Watson R. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2445-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, and 37Saville M.K. Watson R.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 72: 110-140Google Scholar). Recently, cdk-2 and cyclin A were shown to phosphorylate B-Myb during the S-phase of proliferating cells (31Saville M.K. Watson R.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2679-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 32Robinson C. Light Y. Groves R. Mann D. Marais R. Watson R. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1855-1864PubMed Google Scholar, 33Ziebold U.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2445-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated B-Myb was a potent trans-activator of the thymidine kinase promoter containing copies of the MBS from the chicken mim-1 promoter A site. Trans-activation of the TK promoter with MBS was cell specific, detected in U-2 OS and CV-1 cells but not Saos-2 osteosarcoma, or C33A cervical carcinoma cells (34Lane S. Farlie P. Watson R. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2445-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The present study supports the concept that cdk-2/cyclin A phosphorylated B-Myb is also a potent activator of SP-A reporter constructs in HeLa cells. The present study demonstrated that SP-A transcription was most strongly enhanced by myb in the context of alterations in the TTF-1-binding sites, suggesting that the TTF-1 binding to TBE elements influenced the binding and activity of Myb on the MBS. The TBE mutations may alter binding at the MBS through alterations in chromatin structure. Alternatively, the TBE mutations may make accessible binding sites for other nuclear proteins that, in turn, influence Myb binding. Mutation of the MBS and TBE-1,3,4 in combination did not completely abolish transcriptional activity of the pCPA0.45 SP-A construct suggesting that other trans-active proteins may influence SP-A gene transcription from cis-active sites within the SP-A gene sequences −399 to −256. Although mitotic rates of the bronchiolar Clara cells and alveolar Type II cells are low in a healthy adult lung, epithelial cell proliferation is high during fetal and early postnatal development, and increases during recovery from injury. Oxygen injury enhances both cell proliferation and SP-A expression in the lung. For example, SP-A mRNA was enhanced 5–6-fold after exposure of adult rats to 95% oxygen (38Nogee L.M. Wispe' J.R. Clark J.C. Weaver T.E. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1991; 4: 102-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Chronic oxygen exposure of human fetal lung explants caused an increase in SP-A mRNA that was mediated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms (39Acarregui M.J. Kumar A.R. Penisten S.T. Snyder J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L343-L350PubMed Google Scholar). Cyclin A was increased dramatically and cdk-2 modestly in rat alveolar epithelial cells isolated from rat lungs exposed to hyperoxia in vivoat the same time that proliferative activity was increasing in the alveolar epithelial cells (40Bui K.C. Buckley S. Wu F. Uhal B. Joshi I. Liu J. Hussain M. Makhoul I. Warburton D. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L625-L635PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, SP-A, cdk-2, and cyclin A mRNAs increase during hyperoxic injury to the lung, in association with increased mitotic activity involved in lung repair. Taken together, the previous and present studies suggest that phosphorylated B-Myb may play a role in SP-A gene regulation in proliferating epithelial cells following lung injury. In other species, in addition to the mouse, transcriptional activity of the SP-A gene has been reported to be strongly influenced by both TTF-1 and other transcription factors. TTF-1-binding sites were identified in SP-A genes from several species, although the number of TBE, precise spacing, and sequences vary (15Bruno M.D. Bohinski R.J. Huelsman K.M. Whitsett J.A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 4592-4600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). TTF-1 and other transcription factors including upstream factor-1, SP-1, and cAMP response element-binding protein/ATF family members act combinatorially with cAMP to enhance transcription of human, baboon, or rabbit SP-A genes (20Li J. Gao E. Mendelson C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4592-4600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 41Young P.P. Mendelson C.R. Mol.

Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 159-170PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, SP-A genes of the rat or mouse are not activated by cAMP. TTF-1 binding and/or transcriptional activity of TTF-1 is increased by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation mediated, at least in part, by PKA-dependent phosphorylation (19Yan C. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17327-17332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 20Li J. Gao E. Mendelson C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4592-4600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In the present study, cdk-2/cyclin A phosphorylation of B-Myb markedly enhanced its activation of the mouse SP-A gene promoter constructs. The present study demonstrates complex, combinatorial interactions of amyb-binding site with TTF-1-binding sites in the mouse SP-A gene. An MBS was identified in the SP-A gene and activity of the constructs was enhanced by B-Myb. Mutations of TTF-1-binding sites in the mouse gene either enhanced or reduced activity of the SP-A promoter depending on whether other cis-active binding sites, including the MBS, were present. Activation by B-Myb is observed in wild type and TBE mutant promoter constructs. The present study suggests a hypothetical model where phosphorylated B-Myb may bind to and regulate SP-A gene expression in proliferating respiratory epithelial cells following lung injury.
