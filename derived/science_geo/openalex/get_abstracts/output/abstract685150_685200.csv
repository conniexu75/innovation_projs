https://openalex.org/W3214753991,"An open-label, first-in-human phase 1/2 study is being conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pancreatic endoderm cells (PECs) implanted in non-immunoprotective macroencapsulation devices for the treatment of type 1 diabetes. We report an analysis on 1 year of data from the first cohort of 15 patients from a single trial site that received subcutaneous implantation of cell products combined with an immunosuppressive regimen. Implants were well tolerated with no teratoma formation or severe graft-related adverse events. After implantation, patients had increased fasting C-peptide levels and increased glucose-responsive C-peptide levels and developed mixed meal-stimulated C-peptide secretion. There were immunosuppression-related transient increases in circulating regulatory T cells, PD1high T cells, and IL17A+CD4+ T cells. Explanted grafts contained cells with a mature β cell phenotype that were immunoreactive for insulin, islet amyloid polypeptide, and MAFA. These data, and associated findings (Shapiro et al., 2021), are the first reported evidence of meal-regulated insulin secretion by differentiated stem cells in patients."
https://openalex.org/W3217544539,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has achieved remarkable success in hematological malignancies but remains ineffective in solid tumors, due in part to CAR T cell exhaustion in the solid tumor microenvironment. To study dysfunction of mesothelin-redirected CAR T cells in pancreatic cancer, we establish a robust model of continuous antigen exposure that recapitulates hallmark features of T cell exhaustion and discover, both in vitro and in CAR T cell patients, that CAR dysregulation is associated with a CD8+ T-to-NK-like T cell transition. Furthermore, we identify a gene signature defining CAR and TCR dysregulation and transcription factors, including SOX4 and ID3 as key regulators of CAR T cell exhaustion. Our findings shed light on the plasticity of human CAR T cells and demonstrate that genetic downmodulation of ID3 and SOX4 expression can improve the efficacy of CAR T cell therapy in solid tumors by preventing or delaying CAR T cell dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W3216744349,"The NACHT-, leucine-rich-repeat- (LRR), and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) is emerging to be a critical intracellular inflammasome sensor of membrane integrity and a highly important clinical target against chronic inflammation. Here, we report that an endogenous, stimulus-responsive form of full-length mouse NLRP3 is a 12- to 16-mer double-ring cage held together by LRR-LRR interactions with the pyrin domains shielded within the assembly to avoid premature activation. Surprisingly, this NLRP3 form is predominantly membrane localized, which is consistent with previously noted localization of NLRP3 at various membrane organelles. Structure-guided mutagenesis reveals that trans-Golgi network dispersion into vesicles, an early event observed for many NLRP3-activating stimuli, requires the double-ring cages of NLRP3. Double-ring-defective NLRP3 mutants abolish inflammasome punctum formation, caspase-1 processing, and cell death. Thus, our data uncover a physiological NLRP3 oligomer on the membrane that is poised to sense diverse signals to induce inflammasome activation."

https://openalex.org/W4200407033,"Advanced systemic mastocytosis (AdvSM) is a rare, KIT D816V-driven hematologic neoplasm characterized by mast cell infiltration and shortened survival. We report the results of a prespecified interim analysis of an ongoing pivotal single-arm phase 2 trial (no. NCT03580655 ) of avapritinib, a potent, selective KIT D816V inhibitor administered primarily at a once-daily starting dose of 200 mg in patients with AdvSM (n = 62). The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints included mean baseline change in AdvSM-Symptom Assessment Form Total Symptom Score and quality of life, time to response, duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, changes in measures of disease burden and safety. The primary endpoint was successfully met (P = 1.6 × 10-9), with an ORR of 75% (95% confidence interval 57-89) in 32 response-evaluable patients with AdvSM who had sufficient follow-up for response assessment, including 19% with complete remission with full or partial hematologic recovery. Reductions of ≥50% from baseline in serum tryptase (93%), bone marrow mast cells (88%) and KIT D816V variant allele fraction (60%) were observed. The most frequent grade ≥3 adverse events were neutropenia (24%), thrombocytopenia (16%) and anemia (16%). Avapritinib demonstrated a high rate of clinical, morphological and molecular responses and was generally well tolerated in patients with AdvSM."
https://openalex.org/W3214891507,"During embryogenesis, paracrine signaling between tissues in close proximity contributes to the determination of their respective cell fate(s) and development into functional organs. Organoids are in vitro models that mimic organ formation and cellular heterogeneity, but lack the paracrine input of surrounding tissues. Here, we describe a human multilineage iPSC-derived organoid that recapitulates cooperative cardiac and gut development and maturation, with extensive cellular and structural complexity in both tissues. We demonstrate that the presence of endoderm tissue (gut/intestine) in the organoids contributed to the development of cardiac tissue features characteristic of stages after heart tube formation, including cardiomyocyte expansion, compartmentalization, enrichment of atrial/nodal cells, myocardial compaction, and fetal-like functional maturation. Overall, this study demonstrates the ability to generate and mature cooperative tissues originating from different germ lineages within a single organoid model, an advance that will further the examination of multi-tissue interactions during development, physiological maturation, and disease."
https://openalex.org/W4200317891,"Advanced systemic mastocytosis (AdvSM) is a rare hematologic neoplasm driven by the KIT D816V mutation and associated with poor survival. This phase 1 study ( NCT02561988 ) evaluated avapritinib (BLU-285), a selective KIT D816V inhibitor, in patients with AdvSM. The primary endpoints were the maximum tolerated dose, recommended phase 2 dose and safety of avapritinib. Secondary endpoints included overall response rate and changes in measures of mast cell burden. Avapritinib was evaluated at doses of 30-400 mg once daily in 86 patients, 69 with centrally confirmed AdvSM. Maximum tolerated dose was not reached, and 200 mg and 300 mg daily were studied in dose-expansion cohorts. The most frequent adverse events observed were periorbital edema (69%), anemia (55%), diarrhea (45%), thrombocytopenia (44%) and nausea (44%). Intracranial bleeding occurred in 13% overall, but in only 1% of patients without severe thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 × 109/l). In 53 response-evaluable patients, the overall response rate was 75%. The complete remission rate was 36%. Avapritinib elicited ≥50% reductions in marrow mast cells and serum tryptase in 92% and 99% of patients, respectively. Avapritinib induced deep and durable responses, including molecular remission of KIT D816V in patients with AdvSM, and was well tolerated at the recommended phase 2 dose of 200 mg daily."
https://openalex.org/W3215888809,"In many types of cancer, tumor cells prefer to use glycolysis as a major energy acquisition method. Here, we found that the 18fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT)-based markers were positively associated with the expression of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), both of which indicate poor prognosis in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, the regulatory mechanism of PD-L1 remains elusive. In this study, we confirmed that transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1) secreted by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) was a key factor contributing to the expression of PD-L1 in PDAC cells by inducing the nuclear translocation of PKM2. Using co-immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we demonstrated that the interaction between PKM2 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) was enhanced by TGF-β1 stimulation, which facilitated the transactivation of PD-L1 by the binding of PKM2 and STAT1 to its promoter. In vivo, PKM2 knockdown decreased PD-L1 expression in PDAC cells and inhibited tumor growth partly by promoting natural killer cell activation and function, and the combination of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade with PKM2 knockdown limited tumor growth. In conclusion, PKM2 significantly contributes to TAM-induced PD-L1 overexpression and immunosuppression, providing a novel target for immunotherapies for PDAC."
https://openalex.org/W4200001584,"α-Synuclein (α-Syn) is the major protein component of Lewy bodies, a key pathological feature of Parkinson’s disease (PD). The manganese ion Mn2+ has been identified as an environmental risk factor of PD. However, it remains unclear how Mn2+ regulates α-Syn aggregation. Here, we discovered that Mn2+accelerates α-Syn amyloid aggregation through the regulation of protein phase separation. We found that Mn2+ not only promotes α-Syn liquid-to-solid phase transition but also directly induces soluble α-Syn monomers to form solid-like condensates. Interestingly, the lipid membrane is integrated into condensates during Mn2+-induced α-Syn phase transition; however, the preformed Mn2+/α-syn condensates can only recruit lipids to the surface of condensates. In addition, this phase transition can largely facilitate α-Syn amyloid aggregation. Although the Mn2+-induced condensates do not fuse, our results demonstrated that they could recruit soluble α-Syn monomers into the existing condensates. Furthermore, we observed that a manganese chelator reverses Mn2+-induced α-Syn aggregation during the phase transition stage. However, after maturation, α-Syn aggregation becomes irreversible. These findings demonstrate that Mn2+ facilitates α-Syn phase transition to accelerate the formation of α-Syn aggregates and provide new insights for targeting α-Syn phase separation in PD treatment. α-Synuclein (α-Syn) is the major protein component of Lewy bodies, a key pathological feature of Parkinson’s disease (PD).

However, most of these studies were based on cell culture, and their relevance to PD is unknown. Biochemical studies showed that manganese not only shortens the aggregation time of α-Syn but also promotes the formation of large fibrillar aggregates (53Han J.Y. Choi T.S. Kim H.I.

However, how manganese promotes α-Syn assembly in the early stage remains elusive. Many protein–protein or protein–RNA assemblies can form condensed liquid droplets through weak multivalent interactions, called liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS).

In this work, we examined whether Mn2+ regulates α-Syn through LLPS. We observed that α-Syn undergoes LLPS in vitro with the requirement of crowding agents. The addition of Mn2+ efficiently promotes α-Syn liquid-to-solid phase transition, facilitating its amyloid aggregation. Interestingly, Mn2+ could induce α-Syn monomers to form solid-like condensates directly in the absence of crowding agents, bypassing the step of LLPS. We found that Mn2+ could still induce α-Syn phase transition in the presence of lipid membrane. Lipids could be integrated during the formation of condensates but only be recruited to the surface of preformed Mn2+/α-syn condensates. Our studies also demonstrated that Mn2+-induced solid-like condensates proceed with aggregations through recruitment of soluble α-Syn monomers. While it is difficult to disassemble the mature α-Syn fibrillar aggregates, our studies showed that metal chelators could reverse Mn2+-induced aggregates during the phase transition stage. These findings provide a new dimension for understanding the pathogenesis of manganese-induced PD and suggest that LLPS could be a potential target for PD therapy. To study the regulatory effects of Mn2+ on the LLPS of α-Syn, we expressed the full-length human α-Syn (Fig. S1) and examined the conditions in which α-Syn drives LLPS in vitro. We first labeled α-Syn by preparing the EGFP-α-Syn fusion protein. The labeled α-Syn and unlabeled α-Syn were mixed at a molar ratio of 1:9 to form liquid droplets (62Ray S. Singh N. Kumar R. Patel K. Pandey S. Datta D. Mahato J. Panigrahi R. Navalkar A. Mehra S. Gadhe L. Chatterjee D. Sawner A.S. Maiti S. Bhatia S. et al.α-Synuclein aggregation nucleates through liquid-liquid phase separation.Nat. Chem. 2020; 12: 705-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Using fluorescence microscopy, we discovered that α-Syn underwent LLPS with the requirement of a relatively high protein concentration (Fig. S2) and in the presence of crowding agent PEG-10000 (Fig. S3). Ficoll 400, another macromolecular crowding agent, could also promote α-Syn LLPS, although the efficiency is lower (Fig. S4). By contrast, α-Syn failed to drive LLPS in the presence of small-molecule ethylene glycol, supporting that PEG-10000 acts as a crowding agent to drive α-syn LLPS (Fig. S5). Next, we tested whether Mn2+ plays a role in α-Syn LLPS. In the presence of PEG, a frequently used agent to mimic a crowded cellular environment, 200 μM α-Syn formed the typical smooth liquid droplets. When we included 2 mM Mn2+, the morphology of condensates turned irregular (Fig. 1A). The dose-dependence experiments showed that α-syn could form solid-like condensates when Mn2+ concentration was 400 μM or above (Fig. S6). Then we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments to further examine the phase of α-Syn condensates. In the absence of Mn2+, the fluorescence intensity of α-Syn condensates completely returned to their prebleaching state during the 120 s after laser bleaching, indicating the rapid fluidity of α-Syn inside the droplets (Fig. 1, B and C).

Sensory-evoked claustrum activity is thought to modulate the neocortex's context-dependent response to sensory input. Recording from claustrum neurons while mice performed a tactile-visual sensory-selection task, we found that neurons in the anterior claustrum, including putative optotagged claustrocortical neurons projecting to the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), were rarely modulated by sensory input. Rather, they exhibited different types of direction-tuned motor responses. Furthermore, we found that claustrum neurons encoded upcoming movement during intertrial intervals and that pairs of claustrum neurons exhibiting synchronous firing were enriched for pairs preferring contralateral lick directions, suggesting that the activity of specific ensembles of similarly tuned claustrum neurons may modulate cortical activity. Chemogenetic inhibition of claustrocortical neurons decreased lick responses to inappropriate sensory stimuli. Altogether, our data indicate that the claustrum is integrated into higher-order premotor circuits recently implicated in decision-making."

The mean ages in IOI and non-IOI groups were 79.4 ± 8.1 and 73.8 ± 8.9 years old, respectively, and the average age in the IOI group was significantly higher than that in the non-IOI group (P = 0.0425). In addition, the percentages of females in the IOI and non-IOI groups were 43% and 13%, respectively, and IOI occurred predominantly in females (odds ratio: 4.95, P = 0.0076). Moreover, the prevalence of diabetes in the IOI and non-IOI groups was 64% and 32%, respectively, with a significant difference (odds ratio: 3.90, P = 0.0196). In contrast, the prevalence of hypertension in the IOI and non-IOI groups was 36% and 57%, respectively, with no significant difference (P = 0.15).The comparison of clinical profiles of IOI or non-IOI cases in IVBr treatment for AMD suggests that the risk factors for IOI are old age, female sex, and history of diabetes; however, IOI with vasculitis or vascular occlusion in this cohort does not seem to cause severe visual impairment. Further studies are required to investigate potential risk factors for IOI."
https://openalex.org/W3216067949,"Well-orchestrated maternal-fetal cross talk occurs via secreted ligands, interacting receptors, and coupled intracellular pathways between the conceptus and endometrium and is essential for successful embryo implantation. However, previous studies mostly focus on either the conceptus or the endometrium in isolation. The lack of integrated analysis impedes our understanding of early maternal-fetal cross talk. Herein, focusing on ligand-receptor complexes and coupled pathways at the maternal-fetal interface in sheep, we provide the first comprehensive proteomic map of ligand-receptor pathway cascades essential for embryo implantation. We demonstrate that these cascades are associated with cell adhesion and invasion, redox homeostasis, and the immune response. Candidate interactions and their physiological roles were further validated by functional experiments. We reveal the physical interaction of albumin and claudin 4 and their roles in facilitating embryo attachment to endometrium. We also demonstrate a novel function of enhanced conceptus glycolysis in remodeling uterine receptivity by inducing endometrial histone lactylation, a newly identified histone modification. Results from in vitro and in vivo models supported the essential role of lactate in inducing endometrial H3K18 lactylation and in regulating redox homeostasis and apoptotic balance to ensure successful implantation. By reconstructing a map of potential ligand-receptor pathway cascades at the maternal-fetal interface, our study presents new concepts for understanding molecular and cellular mechanisms that fine-tune conceptus-endometrium cross talk during implantation. This provides more direct and accurate insights for developing potential clinical intervention strategies to improve pregnancy outcomes following both natural and assisted conception."

Extracted from this stream, memories must be efficiently encoded and stored in an addressable manner for retrieval. To explore potential mechanisms, we consider a familiarity detection task in which a subject reports whether an image has been previously encountered. We design a feedforward network endowed with synaptic plasticity and an addressing matrix, meta-learned to optimize familiarity detection over long intervals. We find that anti-Hebbian plasticity leads to better performance than Hebbian plasticity and replicates experimental results such as repetition suppression. A combinatorial addressing function emerges, selecting a unique neuron as an index into the synaptic memory matrix for storage or retrieval. Unlike previous models, this network operates continuously and generalizes to intervals it has not been trained on. Our work suggests a biologically plausible mechanism for continual learning and demonstrates an effective application of machine learning for neuroscience discovery."
https://openalex.org/W4225861620,"During periods of rest, hippocampal place cells feature bursts of activity called sharp-wave ripples (SWRs). Heuristic approaches have revealed that a small fraction of SWRs appear to ""simulate"" trajectories through the environment, called awake hippocampal replay. However, the functional role of a majority of these SWRs remains unclear. We find, using Bayesian model comparison of state-space models to characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics embedded in SWRs, that almost all SWRs of foraging rodents simulate such trajectories. Furthermore, these trajectories feature momentum, or inertia in their velocities, that mirrors the animals' natural movement, in contrast to replay events during sleep, which lack such momentum. Last, we show that past analyses of replayed trajectories for navigational planning were biased by the heuristic SWR sub-selection. Our findings thus identify the dominant function of awake SWRs as simulating trajectories with momentum and provide a principled foundation for future work on their computational function."

However, the complete understanding of their complex mechanism of action is still unreached. Here, we unraveled a novel mode of action of the LSD1 inhibitors MC2580 and DDP-38003, showing that they can induce differentiation of AML cells through the downregulation of the chromatin protein GSE1. Analysis of the phenotypic effects of GSE1 depletion in NB4 cells showed a strong decrease of cell viability in vitro and of tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, we found that a set of genes associated with immune response and cytokine-signaling pathways are upregulated by LSD1 inhibitors through GSE1-protein reduction and that LSD1 and GSE1 colocalize at promoters of a subset of these genes at the basal state, enforcing their transcriptional silencing. Moreover, we show that LSD1 inhibitors lead to the reduced binding of GSE1 to these promoters, activating transcriptional programs that trigger myeloid differentiation. Our study offers new insights into GSE1 as a novel therapeutic target for AML."

Rapid urbanization had profound effect on population health, however, little is known about the unmet need of family planning in settings where there was increased industrializations and internal migrations in Ethiopia. This study aims to determine the unmet need for family planning services among currently married women and identify factors associated with it in Bishoftu town, Eastern Ethiopia.Community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from 1st January to 28th February, 2021 among 847 randomly sampled currently married women of the reproductive age group. Data were collected using semi structured interviewer administered questionnaire. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with the outcome variable and a 95% confidence interval was used to declare the presence of statistical significance associations.Eight hundred twenty-eight women were participated in the study. The prevalence of unmet need for family planning among currently married women was 26% [95% CI: 23,29]. Maternal age [AOR, 3.00, 95% CI:1.51-5.95], educational status [AOR, 2.49, 95% CI:1.22-5.07], occupational status of self-employee [AOR, 1.98, 95% CI:1.15-3.39] and housewife [AOR, 1.78, 95% CI:1.02-3.12], being visited by health care provider in the last 12 months [AOR, 1.81, 95% CI: 1.26-2.60] and desired number of children less than two [AOR, 1.53, 95% CI:1.01-2.30] were significantly associated with unmet need for family planning.Unmet need for family planning was higher in the study area compared with the United Nations sphere standard of unmet need for family planning and the national average, and slightly lower than the regional average. Socio-demographic, economic, and health institution factors were determinants of the unmet need for family planning in the study area. Therefore, health education and behaviour change communication related to family planning services should be strengthened and access to family planning services should be improved."

We examined the role of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in corticosterone-mediated potentiation of alcohol-induced gut barrier dysfunction and systemic response. Hepatocyte-specific GR-deficient (GRΔHC ) and intestinal epithelial-specific GR-deficient (GRΔIEC ) mice were fed ethanol, combined with corticosterone treatment. Intestinal epithelial tight junction integrity, mucosal barrier function, microbiota dysbiosis, endotoxemia, systemic inflammation, liver damage, and neuroinflammation were assessed. Corticosterone potentiated ethanol-induced epithelial tight junction disruption, mucosal permeability, and inflammatory response in GRΔHC mouse colon; these effects of ethanol and corticosterone were absent in GRΔIEC mice. Gut microbiota compositions in ethanol-fed GRΔHC and GRΔIEC mice were similar to each other. However, corticosterone treatment in ethanol-fed mice shifted the microbiota composition to distinctly different directions in GRΔHC and GRΔIEC mice. Ethanol and corticosterone synergistically elevated the abundance of Enterobacteriaceae and Escherichia coli and reduced the abundance of Lactobacillus in GRΔHC mice but not in GRΔIEC mice. In GRΔHC mice, corticosterone potentiated ethanol-induced endotoxemia and systemic inflammation, but these effects were absent in GRΔIEC mice. Interestingly, ethanol-induced liver damage and its potentiation by corticosterone were observed in GRΔHC mice but not in GRΔIEC mice. GRΔIEC mice were also resistant to ethanol- and corticosterone-induced inflammatory response in the hypothalamus. These data indicate that the intestinal epithelial GR plays a central role in alcohol- and corticosterone-induced gut barrier dysfunction, microbiota dysbiosis, endotoxemia, systemic inflammation, liver damage, and neuroinflammation. This study identifies a novel target for potential therapeutic for alcohol-associated tissue injury."

We show, for the first time, that the chloride channel CLH-1 is needed in glia of C. elegans nose touch receptors for touch responses and for regulation of excitability. Using in vivo Ca2+ and Cl- imaging, behavioral assays, and combined genetic and pharmacological manipulations, we show that CLH-1 mediates Cl- flux needed for glial GABA inhibition of ASH sensory neuron function and for regulation of cyclic AMP levels in ASH neurons. Finally, we show that the rat ClC-2 channel rescues the clh-1 nose-touch-insensitive phenotype, underscoring conservation of function across species. Our work identifies a glial Cl- channel as a novel regulator of touch sensitivity. We propose that glial CLH-1 regulates the interplay between Ca2+ and cAMP signaling in ASH neurons to control the sensitivity of the worm's nose touch receptors."

Here we demonstrate that T cells expressing TCRs specific for peptides from the intracellular lymphoid-specific enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), presented in the context of HLA-A*02:01, specifically eliminate primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells of T- and B-cell origin in vitro and in three mouse models of disseminated B-ALL. By contrast, the treatment spares normal peripheral T- and B-cell repertoires and normal myeloid cells in vitro, and in vivo in humanized mice. TdT is an attractive cancer target as it is highly and homogeneously expressed in 80–94% of B- and T-ALLs, but only transiently expressed during normal lymphoid differentiation, limiting on-target toxicity of TdT-specific T cells. TCR-modified T cells targeting TdT may be a promising immunotherapy for B-ALL and T-ALL that preserves normal lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W4206137854,"The FtsLB complex is a key regulator of bacterial cell division, existing in either an off state or an on state, which supports the activation of septal peptidoglycan synthesis. In Escherichia coli, residues known to be critical for this activation are located in a region near the C-terminal end of the periplasmic coiled-coil domain of FtsLB, raising questions about the precise role of this conserved domain in the activation mechanism. Here, we investigate an unusual cluster of polar amino acids found within the core of the FtsLB coiled coil. We hypothesized that these amino acids likely reduce the structural stability of the domain and thus may be important for governing conformational changes. We found that mutating these positions to hydrophobic residues increased the thermal stability of FtsLB but caused cell division defects, suggesting that the coiled-coil domain is a ""detuned"" structural element. In addition, we identified suppressor mutations within the polar cluster, indicating that the precise identity of the polar amino acids is important for fine-tuning the structural balance between the off and on states. We propose a revised structural model of the tetrameric FtsLB (named the ""Y-model"") in which the periplasmic domain splits into a pair of coiled-coil branches. In this configuration, the hydrophilic terminal moieties of the polar amino acids remain more favorably exposed to water than in the original four-helix bundle model (""I-model""). We propose that a shift in this architecture, dependent on its marginal stability, is involved in activating the FtsLB complex and triggering septal cell wall reconstruction."
https://openalex.org/W3215027369,"Respiratory silicosis is a preventable occupational disease that develops secondary to the aspiration of crystalline silicon dioxide (silica) into the lungs, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, and IL-1β production. Cathepsin Z has been associated with the development of inflammation and IL-1β production; however, the mechanism of how cathepsin Z leads to IL-1β production is unknown. Here, the requirement for cathepsin Z in silicosis was determined using WT mice and mice deficient in cathepsin Z. The activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages was studied using WT and cathepsin Z-deficient bone marrow-derived murine dendritic cells and the human monocytic cell line THP-1. The cells were activated with silica, and IL-1β release was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or IL-1β bioassays. The relative contribution of the active domain or integrin-binding domain of cathepsin Z was studied using recombinant cathepsin Z constructs and the α5 integrin neutralizing antibody. We report that the lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin Z potentiates the development of inflammation associated with respiratory silicosis by augmenting NLRP3 inflammasome-derived IL-1β expression in response to silica. The secreted cathepsin Z functions nonproteolytically via the internal integrin-binding domain to impact caspase-1 activation and the production of active IL-1β through integrin α5 without affecting the transcription levels of NLRP3 inflammasome components. This work reveals a regulatory pathway for the NLRP3 inflammasome that occurs in an outside-in fashion and provides a link between extracellular cathepsin Z and inflammation. Furthermore, it reveals a level of NLRP3 inflammasome regulation that has previously only been found downstream of extracellular pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W3215741710,"Complex biological functions within organisms are frequently orchestrated by systemic communication between tissues. In the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans, the pharyngeal and body wall neuromuscular junctions are two discrete structures that control feeding and locomotion, respectively. Separate, the well-defined neuromuscular circuits control these distinct tissues. Nonetheless, the emergent behaviors, feeding and locomotion, are coordinated to guarantee the efficiency of food intake. Here, we show that pharmacological hyperactivation of cholinergic transmission at the body wall muscle reduces the rate of pumping behavior. This was evidenced by a systematic screening of the effect of the cholinesterase inhibitor aldicarb on the rate of pharyngeal pumping on food in mutant worms. The screening revealed that the key determinants of the inhibitory effect of aldicarb on pharyngeal pumping are located at the body wall neuromuscular junction. In fact, the selective stimulation of the body wall muscle receptors with the agonist levamisole inhibited pumping in a lev-1-dependent fashion. Interestingly, this response was independent of unc-38, an alpha subunit of the nicotinic receptor classically expressed with lev-1 at the body wall muscle. This implies an uncharacterized lev-1-containing receptor underpins this effect. Overall, our results reveal that body wall cholinergic transmission not only controls locomotion but simultaneously inhibits feeding behavior."

We aimed to characterize the sources of hospital distress and their relationship to anxiety. We conducted a cross-sectional study of inpatients (n = 271) throughout two Southeastern U.S. metropolitan hospitals. Participants completed a survey to identify which of 38 stressors they were experiencing. They also completed the State Trait Anxiety Inventory six-item scale. We evaluated the prevalence of stressors, their distribution, and crude association with anxiety. We then used multivariate logistic regression to estimate the association between stressors and clinically relevant anxiety, with and without adjusting for demographic variables. We used factor analysis to describe the interrelationships among stressors and to examine whether groups of stressors tend to be endorsed together. The following stressors were highly endorsed across all unit types: pain, being unable to sleep, feelings of frustration, being overwhelmed, and fear of the unknown. Stressors relating to isolation/meaninglessness and fear/frustration tend to be endorsed together. Stressors were more frequently endorsed by younger, female, and uninsured or Medicaid-insured patients and being female and uninsured was associated with anxiety in bivariate analysis. After controlling for the sources of distress in multivariate linear analysis, gender and insurance status no longer predicted anxiety. Feelings of isolation, lack of meaning, frustration, fear, or a loss of control were predictive. Study results suggest that multiple stressors are prevalent among hospital inpatients and relatively consistent across hospital unit and disease type. Interventions for anxiety or emotional/spiritual burden may be best targeted to stressors that are frequently endorsed or associated with anxiety, especially among young and female patients."
https://openalex.org/W4220993923,"Circadian misalignment-the misalignment between the central circadian ""clock"" and behavioral and environmental cycles (including sleep/wake, fasting/eating, dark/light)-results in adverse cardiovascular and metabolic effects. Potential underlying mechanisms for these adverse effects include alterations in the orogastrointestinal microbiota. However, it remains unknown whether human oral microbiota has endogenous circadian rhythms (i.e., independent of sleep/wake, fasting/eating, and dark/light cycles) and whether circadian misalignment influences oral microbiota community composition. Healthy young individuals [27.3 ± 2.3 years (18-35 years), 4 men and 2 women, body-mass index range: 18-28 kg/m2 ] were enrolled in a stringently controlled 14-day circadian laboratory protocol. This included a 32-h constant routine (CR) protocol (endogenous circadian baseline assessment), a forced desynchrony protocol with four 28-h ""days"" under ~3 lx to induce circadian misalignment, and a post-misalignment 40-h CR protocol. Microbiota assessments were performed on saliva samples collected every 4 h throughout both CR protocols. Total DNA was extracted and processed using high-throughput 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing. The relative abundance of specific oral microbiota populations, i.e., one of the five dominant phyla, and three of the fourteen dominant genera, exhibited significant endogenous circadian rhythms. Importantly, circadian misalignment dramatically altered the oral microbiota landscape, such that four of the five dominant phyla and eight of the fourteen dominant genera exhibited significant circadian misalignment effects. Moreover, circadian misalignment significantly affected the metagenome functional content of oral microbiota (inferred gene content analysis), as indicated by changes in specific functional pathways associated with metabolic control and immunity. Collectively, our proof-of-concept study provides evidence for endogenous circadian rhythms in human oral microbiota and show that even relatively short-term experimental circadian misalignment can dramatically affect microbiota community composition and functional pathways involved in metabolism and immune function. These proof-of-principle findings have translational relevance to individuals typically exposed to circadian misalignment, including night shift workers and frequent flyers."

Here we report that mice feed a high fat/high cholesterol diet (HFD) are protected from developing a pro-atherogenic lipid profile because their ability to dispose cholesterol through bile acids. This protective mechanism is mediated by suppression of FXR signaling in the liver by muricholic acids (MCAs) generated in mice from chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). In contrast to CDCA, MCAs are FXR antagonists and promote a CYP7A1-dependent increase of bile acids synthesis. In mice feed a HFD, the treatment with obeticholic acid, a clinical stage FXR agonist, failed to improve the liver histopathology while reduced Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1 genes expression and bile acids synthesis and excretion. In contrast, treating mice with atorvastatin mitigated liver and vascular injury caused by the HFD while increased the bile acids synthesis and excretion. Atorvastatin increased the percentage of 7α-dehydroxylase expressing bacteria in the intestine promoting the formation of deoxycholic acid and litocholic acid, two GPBAR1 agonists, along with the expression of GPBAR1-regulated genes in the white adipose tissue and colon. In conclusion, present results highlight the central role of bile acids in regulating lipid and cholesterol metabolism in response to atorvastatin and provide explanations for limited efficacy of FXR agonists in the treatment of NAFLD."
https://openalex.org/W4200113756,"Green development is an effective way to achieve economic growth and social development in a harmonious, sustainable, and efficient manner. Although the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) plays an important strategic role in China, our understanding of its spatiotemporal characteristics, as well as the multiple factors affecting its green development level (GDL), remains limited. This study used the entropy weight method (EWM) to analyze the temporal evolution and spatial differentiation characteristics of the GDL in the YREB from 2011 to 2019. Further, fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) was used to analyze the influence path of GDL. The results showed that the GDL of the YREB increased from 2015 to 2019, but the overall level was still not high, with high GDL mainly concentrated in the lower reaches. The GDL model changed from being environmentally driven and government supported in 2011 to being environmentally and economically driven since 2014. The core conditions for high GDL changed from economic development level (EDL) to scientific technological innovation level (STIL) and environmental regulation (ER). The path for improving GDL is as follows: In regions with high EDL, effective ER, moderate openness level (OL), and high STIL are the basis, supplemented by a reasonable urbanization scale (US). In areas with low EDL, reasonable industrial structure (IS) and STIL are the core conditions for development; further, EDL should be improved and effective ER and OL implemented. Alternatively, without considering changes to EDL, improvement can be achieved through reasonable OL and US or effective ER. This study provides a new method for exploring the path of GDL and a reference for governments to effectively adjust green development policies."
https://openalex.org/W4200348506,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic in March 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). As of May 25th, 2021 there were 2.059.941 SARS-COV2 genome sequences that have been submitted to the GISAID database, with numerous variations. Here, we aim to analyze the SARS-CoV-2 genome data submitted to the GISAID database from Turkey and to determine the variant and clade distributions by the end of May 2021, in accordance with their appearance timeline. We compared these findings to USA, Europe, and Asia data as well. We have also evaluated the effects of spike protein variations, detected in a group of genome sequences of 13 patients who applied to our clinic, by using 3D modeling algorithms. For this purpose, we analyzed 4607 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences submitted by different lab centers from Turkey to the GISAID database between March 2020 and May 2021. Described mutations were also introduced in silico to the spike protein structure to analyze their isolated impacts on the protein structure. The most abundant clade was GR followed by G, GH, and GRY and we did not detect any V clade. The most common variant was B.1, followed by B.1.1, and the UK variant, B.1.1.7. Our results clearly show a concordance between the variant distributions, the number of cases, and the timelines of different variant accumulations in Turkey. The 3D simulations indicate an increase in the surface hydrophilicity of the reference spike protein and the detected mutations. There was less surface hydrophilicity increase in the Asp614Gly mutation, which exhibits a more compact conformation around the ACE-2 receptor binding domain region, rendering the structure in a ""down"" conformation. Our genomic findings can help to model vaccination programs and protein modeling may lead to different approaches for COVID-19 treatment strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4200402349,"Interleukin (IL)-22 is a cytokine that plays a critical role in intestinal epithelial homeostasis. Its downstream functions are mediated through interaction with the heterodimeric IL-22 receptor and subsequent activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). IL-22 signaling can induce transcription of genes necessary for intestinal epithelial cell proliferation, tissue regeneration, tight junction fortification, and antimicrobial production. Recent studies have also implicated IL-22 signaling in the regulation of intestinal epithelial fucosylation in mice. However, whether IL-22 regulates intestinal fucosylation in human intestinal epithelial cells and the molecular mechanisms that govern this process are unknown. Here, in experiments performed in human cell lines and human-derived enteroids, we show that IL-22 signaling regulates expression of the B3GNT7 transcript, which encodes a β1-3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase that can participate in the synthesis of poly-N-acetyllactosamine (polyLacNAc) chains. Additionally, we find that IL-22 signaling regulates levels of the α1-3-fucosylated Lewis X (Lex) blood group antigen, and that this glycan epitope is primarily displayed on O-glycosylated intestinal epithelial glycoproteins. Moreover, we show that increased expression of B3GNT7 alone is sufficient to promote increased display of Lex-decorated carbohydrate glycan structures primarily on O-glycosylated intestinal epithelial glycoproteins. Together, these data identify B3GNT7 as an intermediary in IL-22-dependent induction of fucosylation of glycoproteins and uncover a novel role for B3GNT7 in intestinal glycosylation."
https://openalex.org/W4226126370,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent cardiac arrhythmia in humans. Genetic and genomic analyses have recently demonstrated that the homeobox transcription factor Pitx2 plays a fundamental role regulating expression of distinct growth factors, microRNAs and ion channels leading to morphological and molecular alterations that promote the onset of AF. Here we address the plausible contribution of long non-coding (lnc)RNAs within the Pitx2>Wnt>miRNA signaling pathway. In silico analyses of annotated lncRNAs in the vicinity of the Pitx2, Wnt8 and Wnt11 chromosomal loci identified five novel lncRNAs with differential expression during cardiac development. Importantly, three of them, Walaa, Walras, and Wallrd, are evolutionarily conserved in humans and displayed preferential atrial expression during embryogenesis. In addition, Walrad displayed moderate expression during embryogenesis but was more abundant in the right atrium. Walaa, Walras and Wallrd were distinctly regulated by Pitx2, Wnt8, and Wnt11, and Wallrd was severely elevated in conditional atrium-specific Pitx2-deficient mice. Furthermore, pro-arrhythmogenic and pro-hypertrophic substrate administration to primary cardiomyocyte cell cultures consistently modulate expression of these lncRNAs, supporting distinct modulatory roles of the AF cardiovascular risk factors in the regulation of these lncRNAs. Walras affinity pulldown assays revealed its association with distinct cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins previously involved in cardiac pathophysiology, while loss-of-function assays further support a pivotal role of this lncRNA in cytoskeletal organization. We propose that lncRNAs Walaa, Walras and Wallrd, distinctly regulated by Pitx2>Wnt>miRNA signaling and pro-arrhythmogenic and pro-hypertrophic factors, are implicated in atrial arrhythmogenesis, and Walras additionally in cardiomyocyte cytoarchitecture."

In this study, we used ACh, cytisine, and nicotine (which bind at both the α4:α4 and α4:β2 interfaces), TC-2559 (which binds at the α4:β2 but not at the α4:α4 interface), and 3-(2-chlorophenyl)-5-(5-methyl-1-(piperidin-4-yl)-1H-pyrrazol-4-yl)isoxazole (CMPI, which binds at the α4:α4 but not at the α4:β2 interface), to investigate the binding and gating properties of CMPI at the α4:α4 interface. We recorded whole-cell currents from Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing (α4)3(β2)2 nAChR in response to applications of these ligands, alone or in combination. The electrophysiological data were analyzed in the framework of a modified Monod-Wyman-Changeux allosteric activation model. We show that CMPI is a high-affinity, high-efficacy agonist at the α4:α4 binding site and that its weak direct activating effect is accounted for by its inability to productively interact with the α4:β2 sites. The data presented here enhance our understanding of the functional contributions of ligand binding at the α4:α4 subunit interface to (α4)3(β2)2 nAChR-channel gating. These findings support the potential use of α4:α4 specific ligands to increase the efficacy of the neurotransmitter ACh in conditions associated with decline in nAChRs activity in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W3216414180,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR), the most common complication of diabetes mellitus, is associated with oxidative stress, nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) activation, and excess production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Muller glial cells, spanning the entirety of the retina, are involved in DR inflammation. Mitigation of DR pathology currently occurs via invasive, frequently ineffective therapies which can cause adverse effects. The application of far-red to near-infrared (NIR) light (630-1000nm) reduces oxidative stress and inflammation in vitro and in vivo. Thus, we hypothesize that 670nm light treatment will diminish oxidative stress preventing downstream inflammatory mechanisms associated with DR initiated by Muller cells. In this study, we used an in vitro model system of rat Müller glial cells grown under normal (5 mM) or high (25 mM) glucose conditions and treated with a 670 nm light emitting diode array (LED) (4.5 J/cm2) or no light (sham) daily. We report that a single 670 nm light treatment diminished reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and preserved mitochondrial integrity in this in vitro model of early DR. Furthermore, treatment for 3 days in culture reduced NFκB activity to levels observed in normal glucose and prevented the subsequent increase in ICAM-1. The ability of 670nm light treatment to prevent early molecular changes in this in vitro high glucose model system suggests light treatment could mitigate early deleterious effects modulating inflammatory signaling and diminishing oxidative stress."

We demonstrate the suitability of the Limbic Chair in two VR scenarios: city navigation and flight simulation. We compare the Limbic Chair to a gamepad using performance measures (i.e., time and accuracy), head movements, body sway, and standard questionnaires for measuring presence, usability, workload, and simulator sickness. In the city navigation scenario, the gamepad was associated with better presence, usability, and workload scores. In the flight simulation scenario, the chair was associated with less body sway (i.e., less simulator sickness) and fewer head movements but also slower performance and higher workload. In all other comparisons, the Limbic Chair and gamepad were similar, showing the promise of the Chair for replacing some control functions traditionally executed using handheld devices."
https://openalex.org/W4200496908,"Bacillus anthracis lethal toxin and edema toxin are binary toxins that consist of a common cell-binding moiety, protective antigen (PA), and the enzymatic moieties, lethal factor (LF) and edema factor (EF). PA binds to either of two receptors, capillary morphogenesis protein-2 (CMG-2) or tumor endothelial marker-8 (TEM-8), which triggers the binding and cytoplasmic translocation of LF and EF. However, the distribution of functional TEM-8 and CMG-2 receptors during anthrax toxin intoxication in animals has not been fully elucidated. Herein, we describe an assay to image anthrax toxin intoxication in animals, and we use it to visualize TEM-8- and CMG-2-dependent intoxication in mice. Specifically, we generated a chimeric protein consisting of the N-terminal domain of LF fused to a nuclear localization signal-tagged Cre recombinase (LFn-NLS-Cre). When PA and LFn-NLS-Cre were coadministered to transgenic mice expressing a red fluorescent protein in the absence of Cre and a green fluorescent protein in the presence of Cre, intoxication could be visualized at single-cell resolution by confocal microscopy or flow cytometry. Using this assay, we found that: (a) CMG-2 is critical for intoxication in the liver and heart, (b) TEM-8 is required for intoxication in the kidney and spleen, (c) CMG-2 and TEM-8 are redundant for intoxication of some organs, (d) combined loss of CMG-2 and TEM-8 completely abolishes intoxication, and (e) CMG-2 is the dominant receptor on leukocytes. The novel assay will be useful for basic and clinical/translational studies of Bacillus anthracis infection and for clinical development of reengineered toxin variants for cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4226220483,"A growing body of literature suggests that higher engagement in a range of activities can be beneficial for cognitive health in old age. Such studies typically rely on self-report questionnaires to assess level of engagement. These questionnaires are highly heterogeneous across studies, limiting generalisability. In particular, the most appropriate domains of activity engagement remain unclear. The Victoria Longitudinal Study-Activity Lifestyle Questionnaire comprises one of the broadest and most diverse collections of activity items, but different studies report different domain structures. This study aimed to help establish a generalisable domain structure of the Victoria Longitudinal Study-Activity Lifestyle Questionnaire. The questionnaire was adapted for use in a sample of UK-based older adults (336 community-dwelling adults aged 65-92 with no diagnosed cognitive impairment). An exploratory factor analysis was conducted on 29 items. The final model retained 22 of these items in a six-factor structure. Activity domains were: Manual (e.g., household repairs), Intellectual (e.g., attending a public lecture), Games (e.g., card games), Religious (e.g., attending religious services), Exercise (e.g., aerobics) and Social (e.g., going out with friends). Given that beneficial activities have the potential to be adapted into interventions, it is essential that future studies consider the most appropriate measurement of activity engagement across domains. The factor structure reported here offers a parsimonious and potentially useful way for future studies to assess engagement in different kinds of activities."

Proteolytic enzymes of the trypsin family utilize the D102/H57/S195 (chymotrypsinogen numbering) triad for activity and participate in physiologically important functions such as digestion, blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, development, fertilization, apoptosis, and immunity (1Perona J.J.

In this mechanism, the zymogen is cut at the highly conserved residue R15 to generate a new N-terminus that H-bonds to D194 next to the catalytic S195. This prepares the enzyme for efficient substrate binding and catalysis by organizing the primary specificity pocket around D189, structuring the oxyanion hole defined by the backbone N atoms of G193 and S195, and establishing proper H-bonding interactions among residues of the catalytic triad (1Perona J.J.

In this context, it is important to clarify that the term “activation” refers to the enhancement of catalytic activity induced by M+ binding and is distinct from the zymogen to protease conversion of the Huber–Bode mechanism. Some M+-activated enzymes utilize the M+ as an integral component of the catalytic mechanism and make the M+ an absolute requirement for activity. Other enzymes use the M+ as an allosteric effector that binds away from the active site and increases activity to the level required by physiologic function. This is the case of the clotting protease thrombin (14Wells C.M. Di Cera E. Thrombin is a Na(+)-activated enzyme.Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11721-11730Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) for which Na+ is not absolutely required for catalysis, yet it is necessary for efficient procoagulant and signaling activities (15Di Cera E. Thrombin.Mol. Aspects Med. 2008; 29: 203-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Binding of Na+ to thrombin takes place within a buried site defined by the 180 and 220 loops and located >15 Å away from residues of the catalytic triad (Fig. 1) (16Di Cera E. Guinto E.R. Vindigni A.

These loops are organized upon zymogen activation through the Huber–Bode mechanism and not only provide the locale for Na+ binding and M+ specificity (18Prasad S. Wright K.J. Roy D.B. Bush L.A.

Hence, substrate and Na+ binding to thrombin are structurally and functionally linked, but the determinants of such linkage are not fully understood at the molecular level. The Na-binding affinity is in the mM range, strongly temperature-dependent, and insufficient to saturate the site under physiologic conditions where [Na+] = 140 mM (14Wells C.M. Di Cera E. Thrombin is a Na(+)-activated enzyme.Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11721-11730Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Because the [Na+] is tightly controlled in vivo, the role of Na+ is structural rather than regulatory. Residues influencing the energetics of Na+ binding at equilibrium have been identified by site-directed mutagenesis and are all located near the Na+-binding site, as expected (17Pineda A.O. Carrell C.J. Bush L.A. Prasad S. Caccia S. Chen Z.W. Mathews F.S. Di Cera E. Molecular dissection of Na+ binding to thrombin.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31842-31853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). On the other hand, residues responsible for the allosteric transduction of Na+ binding into enhanced catalytic activity have been more difficult to identify. Interestingly, the catalytic S195 itself has emerged as a potentially important player in the allosteric transduction (22Pelc L.A. Chen Z. Gohara D.W. Vogt A.D. Pozzi N. Di Cera E. Why Ser and not Thr brokers catalysis in the trypsin fold.Biochemistry. 2015; 54: 1457-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The S195T substitution compromises activity because of a potential clash of the bulkier side chain with the adjacent C42/C58 disulfide bond (Fig. 1), as first suggested for trypsin (23Baird Jr., T.T. Wright W.D. Craik C.S. Conversion of trypsin to a functional threonine protease.Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 1229-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), but it also abolishes the Na+-induced enhancement of catalytic activity without affecting Na+ binding at equilibrium. The same deleterious effect on Na+ activation is observed by replacing the active site Ser with Thr in the cognate proteases factor Xa and activated protein C (22Pelc L.A. Chen Z. Gohara D.W.

The perturbation also compromises the thrombomodulin-induced enhancement of protein C activation by thrombin and the cofactor Va-induced enhancement of prothrombin activation by factor Xa (22Pelc L.A.

In this study, we address the role of S195 and the active site region in Na+ activation of thrombin. We identify the likely point of entry of Na+ to its site buried within the 180 and 220 loops and show how the properties of residue 195 influence the kinetic mechanism of Na+ binding and the resulting allosteric enhancement of catalytic activity through long-range communication with the Na+ site. Rapid kinetics of Na+ binding to thrombin (24Bah A. Garvey L.C. Ge J. Di Cera E. Rapid kinetics of Na+ binding to thrombin.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 40049-40056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) feature a fast relaxation completed within the dead time (0.5 ms) of the stopped flow apparatus, followed by a slow relaxation consistent with a single exponential phase (Fig. 2A). The rate associated with the slow relaxation decreases hyperbolically with [Na+] (Fig. 2B), and the resulting profile is unequivocal proof of binding according to a mechanism of conformational selection (25Vogt A.D. Di Cera E. Conformational selection or induced fit? A critical appraisal of the kinetic mechanism.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 5894-5902Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 26Di Cera E. Mechanisms of ligand binding.Biophys. Rev. 2020; 1011303Crossref Google Scholar), i.e.,N∗k12⇄k21Nkonx⇄koffNX(1) Where x = [Na+]. The mechanism in Equation 1 implies that the Na+ site exists in equilibrium between closed, N∗, and open, N, conformations and that Na+ (X) interacts selectively with N through a second-order association rate constant kon and a first-order dissociation rate constant koff. The equilibrium dissociation constant for Na+ binding is defined as the ratio Kd=koff/kon. Two additional parameters in Equation 1, k12 and k21, define the first-order rate constants to open (N∗→N) and close (N∗←N) access to the Na+-binding site, respectively. The sum keq = k12 + k21 measures the rate at which the equilibrium N∗⇌N is established (26Di Cera E. Mechanisms of ligand binding.Biophys. Rev. 2020; 1011303Crossref Google Scholar, 27Fersht A.R. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. Freeman, New York, NY1999Google Scholar). The scheme in Equation 1 contains two independent relaxations, α1(x) and α2(x), reflecting the binding interaction N⇌NX and the conformational transition N∗⇌N, respectively. Resolution of the four independent rate constants in Equation 1 in the general case demands measurements of both relaxations and analysis through mathematical expressions discussed at length elsewhere (26Di Cera E. Mechanisms of ligand binding.Biophys. Rev. 2020; 1011303Crossref Google Scholar). In the case of Na+ binding to thrombin (Fig. 2A), the step N⇌NX reaches equilibrium more rapidly than the N∗⇌N step and the relevant expression for α2(x), which is the only relaxation measured experimentally, simplifies as (25Vogt A.D. Di Cera E. Conformational selection or induced fit? A critical appraisal of the kinetic mechanism.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 5894-5902Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 26Di Cera E. Mechanisms of ligand binding.Biophys. Rev. 2020; 1011303Crossref Google Scholar)α2(x)=k12+k21KdKd+x(2) The expression in Equation 2 contains three independent parameters that can be resolved as the limiting values α2(0) = k12 + k21, α2(∞) = k12 and the midpoint of the transition, Kd. The value of k12 =106 ± 9 s−1 (Fig. 2B) indicates that access to the Na+ site opens in <10 ms. The value k21 =150 ± 20 s−1 implies that keq = k12 + k21 = 260 ± 30 s−1 and that the N∗⇌N equilibrium is reached in <4 ms. Furthermore, the equilibrium is shifted slightly in favor of the N∗ conformation (k12 < k12), that is populated by 59% of the free molecules in solution. The mechanism of Na+ binding to thrombin in Equation 1 is reminiscent of the E∗⇌E equilibrium between closed (E∗) and open (E) conformations of the active site of trypsin proteases uncovered by structural biology (28Gohara D.W.

The E∗ form features a small shift of the 215 to 217 segment into the active site that is sufficient to preclude access of substrate to the primary specificity pocket. In general, the E∗ form predominates in the zymogen and is progressively shifted to the E form upon transition to the protease, enabling efficient binding and catalysis (32Chakraborty P.

Importantly, the E∗⇌E equilibrium is present in all proteases of the trypsin family, regardless of their ability to bind Na+ (28Gohara D.W. Di Cera E. Allostery in trypsin-like proteases suggests new therapeutic strategies.Trends Biotechnol. 2011; 29: 577-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 29Pozzi N. Vogt A.D. Gohara D.W. Di Cera E. Conformational selection in trypsin-like proteases.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2012; 22: 421-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and indeed Na+ binding can be suppressed in Na+-activated proteases with little or no effect on the E∗⇌E equilibrium (43Niu W. Chen Z. Gandhi P.S. Vogt A.D. Pozzi N. Pelc L.A. Zapata F.J. Di Cera E. Crystallographic and kinetic evidence of allostery in a trypsin-like protease.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 6301-6307Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the value of k12 =106 ± 9 s−1 measured for Na+ binding (Fig. 2B) is very similar to the value of k12 =56 ± 5 s−1 measured for binding of the irreversible inhibitor H-D-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2Cl (PPACK) to the active site, under the same experimental conditions (44Pelc L.A. Koester S.K. Chen Z. Gistover N.E. Di Cera E. Residues W215, E217 and E192 control the allosteric E∗-E equilibrium of thrombin.Sci. Rep. 2019; 9: 12304Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The similarity is observed over a broad temperature range (5–30 °C), with a strong correlation (r2 = 0.97) in the plot where the N∗→N transition opening the Na+ binding site (Fig. 3A and Table 1) is compared with the E∗→E transition opening the active site (Fig. 3B). Nearly identical activation energies (12 kcal/mol) also support a common rate-limiting step and molecular origin for the two processes. We conclude that the N∗⇌N equilibrium is a component of the E∗⇌E equilibrium and that the active site provides the point of entry for Na+ from the bulk solvent to its site buried within the 180 and 220 loops. This conclusion is relevant to all Na+-activated proteases in the blood coagulation and complement cascades that share the same locale for Na+ binding (3Page M.J. Di Cera E.

Experimental conditions: 20 mM Tris, 200 mM ChCl, 0.1% PEG8000, pH 8.0. Support to the foregoing conclusion about the role of the active site as the point of entry for Na+ binding comes from mutagenesis of the 180 and 220 loops. The crystal structure of thrombin in the E form (17Pineda A.O. Carrell C.J. Bush L.A. Prasad S. Caccia S. Chen Z.W. Mathews F.S. Di Cera E. Molecular dissection of Na+ binding to thrombin.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31842-31853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) reveals an intriguing pore defined by the adjacent 180 and 220 loops that could function as a gate to the Na+ site (Fig. 4, A and B). Interestingly, the pore closes in the E∗ form (Fig. 4C) when access of substrate to the primary specificity pocket is compromised by a shift of the 215 to 217 segment (46Pineda A.O. Chen Z.W. Bah A. Garvey L.C. Mathews F.S. Di Cera E. Crystal structure of thrombin in a self-inhibited conformation.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32922-32928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The linkage between opening and closing of the pore and the E∗⇌E equilibrium provides an alternative explanation for the correlation reported in Figure 3B. However, this point of entry to the Na+ site would make thrombin unique among all Na+-activated proteases of the trypsin family because none of them, including factor Xa and activated protein C (45Vogt A.D. Bah A. Di Cera E. Evidence of the E∗-E equilibrium from rapid kinetics of Na(+) binding to activated protein C and factor Xa.J. Phys. Chem.

Sodium ion in the APC crystal structure is coordinated to four carbonyl groups from two separate loops.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28987-28995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The role of the 180 and 220 loops in thrombin was studied previously with several replacements, insertions, and deletions and Na+ binding was found to be perturbed but not abrogated (18Prasad S. Wright K.J. Roy D.B. Bush L.A. Cantwell A.M. Di Cera E. Redesigning the monovalent cation specificity of an enzyme.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13785-13790Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Swapping the entire 184a to 188 and 221 to 224 sequences of the 180 and 220 loops between thrombin (184aYKPDEGKRG188 and 221DRDGK224) and activated protein C (184aILGDRQ188 and 221GLLHN224) produces a thrombin mutant, Thrombin180/220, that is expected to lack the pore (Fig. 4D). Indeed, the crystal structure of Thrombin180/220 solved at 2.1 Å resolution (Table 2) shows that the pore is occluded (Fig. 4E). The mutant features only a rapid jump in fluorescence when Na+ binding is studied by stopped flow (data not shown), without the second slow relaxation observed in the wild-type (Fig. 2). The rapid jump is not consistent with loss of Na+ binding. In fact, the mutant shows enhanced M+ activation and a shift of the M+ specificity from Na+ to K+ (Fig. 5B) (19Rana S. Pozzi N. Pelc L.A. Di Cera E. Redesigning allosteric activation in an enzyme.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2011; 108: 5221-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These structural and functional findings rule out the pore being a gate to the Na+ binding site. Further support to this conclusion comes from the reverse swap of the 180 and 220 loops between activated protein C and thrombin, APC180/220, that is expected to perturb Na+ binding by introducing the pore seen in thrombin (Fig. 4A). The APC180/220 mutant features a Na+-binding profile by rapid kinetics practically identical to that of wild-type activated protein C (Fig. 5A), with slightly reduced catalytic activity and M+ activation that singles out Na+ as an exclusive activator (Fig. 5B).Table 2Crystallographic data for Thrombin180/220PDB entry7SR9Buffer/salt0.1 M Tris, pH 8.5, 0.2 M Li2SO4PEG4000 (30%)Data collection: Wavelength (Å)1.54 Space groupC2 Unit cell dimensions (Å)a = 99, b = 78.5, c = 49.6, β = 103.2° Molecules/asymmetric unit1 Resolution range (Å)40–2.1 Observations63,767 Unique observations21,066 Completeness (%)96.9 (86.8) Rsym (%)6.7 (37.3) I/σ(I)14.2 (2.2)Refinement: Resolution (Å)40–2.1 Rcryst, Rfree0.18, 0.22 Reflections (working/test)19,962/1073 Protein atoms2336 Solvent molecules191 Rmsd bond lengthsaRoot-mean-squared deviation (Rmsd) from ideal bond lengths and angles and Rmsd in B-factors of bonded atoms.

Data were collected through an online survey from 1 st July to 30 th July 2020 during the first peak of COVID-19 in the study area by using the questionnaire. Authors based on the latest recommendations by the World Health Organization (WHO) developed the questionnaire and covered the KAP aspects under study. The questionnaire was administered through Google form link and the link was disseminated through social media such as Facebook and What’s App. The completed responses (n = 533) received from the eligible sample, excluding those outsides of the fisher community and duplicate entries were considered for analysis. Appropriate statistical tools were used to analyze the data. Among the respondents, 447 men (83.86%) and 86 women (16.14%), with a mean age of 45.4 years (M = 45.4, SD = 1.18). The results revealed that 70.92% of respondents perceived a low risk of infection because of COVID-19 with M = 1.77 and SD = 0.583, but authors found the perceived severity score high (M = 3.95, SD = 1.21) among the 60.97% of respondents. Around 95% of respondents were aware of the COVID-19, while almost all respondents knew the medium of infection and symptoms of COVID-19. The behavior of respondents towards COVID-19 infection was positive and was following sufficient precautionary measures suggested by WHO to protect themselves from COVID-19 infection. The results of multiple regression analysis revealed that the demographic features of respondents like age, education were significantly contributing to the KAP of the fisher community. The results confirmed the importance of KAP which is reflected in the behavioral responses of the fishers while tackling the COVID-19 pandemic situation. The results regarding the risk perception, severity, KAP about COVID-19 provide a collective understanding of the emerging infectious disease among the marine fishers of Maharashtra state of India."
https://openalex.org/W3217539860,"Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are ubiquitous regulatory modules for bacterial growth and cell survival following stress. YefM-YoeB, the most prevalent type II TA system, is present in a variety of bacterial species. In Staphylococcus aureus, the YefM-YoeB system exists as two independent paralogous copies. Our previous research resolved crystal structures of the two oligomeric states (heterotetramer and heterohexamer-DNA ternary complex) of the first paralog as well as the molecular mechanism of transcriptional autoregulation of this module. However, structural details reflecting molecular diversity in both paralogs have been relatively unexplored. To understand the molecular mechanism of how Sa2YoeB and Sa2YefM regulate their own transcription and how each paralog functions independently, we solved a series of crystal structures of the Sa2YoeB-Sa2YefM. Our structural and biochemical data demonstrated that both paralogous copies adopt similar mechanisms of transcriptional autoregulation. In addition, structural analysis suggested that molecular diversity between the two paralogs might be reflected in the interaction profile of YefM and YoeB and the recognition pattern of promoter DNA by YefM. Interaction analysis revealed unique conformational and activating force effected by the interface between Sa2YoeB and Sa2YefM. In addition, the recognition pattern analysis demonstrated that residues Thr7 and Tyr14 of Sa2YefM specifically recognizes the flanking sequences (G and C) of the promoter DNA. Together, these results provide the structural insights into the molecular diversity and independent function of the paralogous copies of the YoeB-YefM TA system."
https://openalex.org/W4200057822,"Airway epithelial barrier dysfunction is increasingly recognized as a key feature of asthma and other lung diseases. Respiratory viruses are responsible for a large fraction of asthma exacerbations, and are particularly potent at disrupting epithelial barrier function through pattern recognition receptor engagement leading to tight junction dysfunction. Although different mechanisms of barrier dysfunction have been described, relatively little is known about whether barrier integrity can be promoted to limit disease. Here, we tested three classes of drugs commonly prescribed to treat asthma for their ability to promote barrier function using a cell culture model of virus-induced airway epithelial barrier disruption. Specifically, we studied the corticosteroid budesonide, the long acting beta-agonist formoterol, and the leukotriene receptor antagonist montelukast for their ability to promote barrier integrity of a monolayer of human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE) before exposure to the viral mimetic double-stranded RNA. Of the three, only budesonide treatment limited transepithelial electrical resistance and small molecule permeability (4 kDa FITC-dextran flux). Next, we used a mouse model of acute dsRNA challenge that induces transient epithelial barrier disruption in vivo , and studied the effects budesonide when administered prophylactically or therapeutically. We found that budesonide similarly protected against dsRNA-induced airway barrier disruption in the lung, independently of its effects on airway inflammation. Taken together, these data suggest that an under-appreciated effect of inhaled budesonide is to maintain or promote airway epithelial barrier integrity during respiratory viral infections."
https://openalex.org/W4200106272,"In this study we examine the effects of experience and culture on choral teachers' description of choral tone across a range of genres. What does a ""good"" choral music performance sound like? Is there an objective standard of performance excellence, or is beauty in the eye of the beholder? In teacher preparation programs, choral directors in the United States have been taught to identify and teach particular, culturally-bounded standards of choral tone in their students. Choral directors evaluate their students' voices along two dimensions: health and appropriateness. They discern and describe whether the student's musical instrument-their voice-is producing sound in a healthy and non-damaging way. They also judge whether the style of their sound is appropriate for the music they are singing. However, teacher preparation programs do not provide common standards or lexicon for describing tone. This may increase implicit bias of individual directors, and inadvertently exacerbate ethnocentrism and harm students' self-perception. Using a computational text analysis approach, we evaluate the content of open-ended survey responses from teachers, finding that the language used to describe and rate choral performance varies by experience, and by the choral selection (e.g., whether it is a traditional Western or non-Western song). We suggest that regularizing the terminology and providing common training through professional organizations can minimize potential bias and generate more systematic, precise use of qualitative descriptors of health and appropriateness, which will benefit students and teachers."
https://openalex.org/W4200333655,"This research proposes a new multi-membrane search algorithm (MSA) based on cell biological behavior. Cell secretion protein behavior and cell division and fusion strategy are the main inspirations for the algorithm. In order to verify the performance of the algorithm, we used 19 benchmark functions to compare the MSA test results with MVO, GWO, MFO and ALO. The number of iterations of each algorithm on each benchmark function is 100, the population number is 10, and the running is repeated 50 times, and the average and standard deviation of the results are recorded. Tests show that the MSA is competitive in unimodal benchmark functions and multi-modal benchmark functions, and the results in composite benchmark functions are all superior to MVO, MFO, ALO, and GWO algorithms. This paper also uses MSA to solve two classic engineering problems: welded beam design and pressure vessel design. The result of welded beam design is 1.7252, and the result of pressure vessel design is 5887.7052, which is better than other comparison algorithms. Statistical experiments show that MSA is a high-performance algorithm that is competitive in unimodal and multimodal functions, and its performance in compound functions is significantly better than MVO, MFO, ALO, and GWO algorithms."
https://openalex.org/W3215044181,"Recently, studies on competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks have become prevalent, and circular RNAs (circRNAs) have crucial implications for the development and progression of carcinoma. However, studies relevant to metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa) are scant. This study aims to discover potential ceRNAs that may be related to the prognosis of mPCa. RNA-Seq data were obtained from the MiOncoCirc database and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Differential expression patterns of RNAs were examined using R packages. Circular RNA Interactome, miRTarBase, miRDB and TargetScan were applied to predict the corresponding relation between circRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs. The Gene Ontology (GO) annotations were performed to present related GO terms, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) tools were applied for pathway annotations. Moreover, survival analysis was conducted for the hub genes. We found 820 circRNAs, 81 miRNAs and 179 mRNAs that were distinguishingly expressed between primary prostate cancer (PCa) and mPCa samples. A ceRNA network including 45 circRNAs, 24 miRNAs and 56 mRNAs was constructed. In addition, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was built, and 10 hub genes were selected by using the CytoHubba application. Among the 10 hub genes, survival analysis showed that ITGA1, LMOD1, MYH11, MYLK, SORBS1 and TGFBR3 were significantly connected with disease-free survival (DFS). The circRNA-mediated ceRNA network provides potential prognostic biomarkers for metastatic prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3215381530,"The propensity to kill and consume conspecifics (cannibalism) varies greatly between and within species, but the underlying mechanisms behind this variation remain poorly understood. A rich literature has documented that consistent behavioural variation is ubiquitous across the animal kingdom. Such inter-individual behavioural differences, sometimes referred to as personality traits, may have far-reaching ecological consequences. However, the link between predator personality traits and the propensity to engage in cannibalistic interactions remains understudied. Here, we first quantified personality in Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis), measured as activity (time spent moving) and sociability (time spent near conspecifics). We then gave perch of contrasting behavioural types the option to consume either conspecific or heterospecific (roach, Rutilus rutilus) prey. Individual perch characterized by a social-active behavioural phenotype (n = 5) selected roach before being cannibalistic, while asocial-inactive perch (n = 17) consumed conspecific and heterospecific prey evenly. Thus, asocial-inactive perch expressed significantly higher rates of cannibalism as compared to social-active individuals. Individual variation in cannibalism, linked to behavioural type, adds important mechanistic understanding to complex population and community dynamics, and also provides insight into the diversity and maintenance of animal personality."
https://openalex.org/W3216773413,"Wall teichoic acid (WTA) polymers are covalently affixed to the Gram-positive bacterial cell wall and have important functions in cell elongation, cell morphology, biofilm formation, and β-lactam antibiotic resistance. The first committed step in WTA biosynthesis is catalyzed by the TagA glycosyltransferase (also called TarA), a peripheral membrane protein that produces the conserved linkage unit, which joins WTA to the cell wall peptidoglycan. TagA contains a conserved GT26 core domain followed by a C-terminal polypeptide tail that is important for catalysis and membrane binding. Here, we report the crystal structure of the Thermoanaerobacter italicus TagA enzyme bound to UDP-N-acetyl-d-mannosamine, revealing the molecular basis of substrate binding. Native MS experiments support the model that only monomeric TagA is enzymatically active and that it is stabilized by membrane binding. Molecular dynamics simulations and enzyme activity measurements indicate that the C-terminal polypeptide tail facilitates catalysis by encapsulating the UDP-N-acetyl-d-mannosamine substrate, presenting three highly conserved arginine residues to the active site that are important for catalysis (R214, R221, and R224). From these data, we present a mechanistic model of catalysis that ascribes functions for these residues. This work could facilitate the development of new antimicrobial compounds that disrupt WTA biosynthesis in pathogenic bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W4200088130,"While the eye is considered an immune privileged site, its privilege is abrogated when immune cells are recruited from the surrounding vasculature in response to trauma, infection, aging, and autoimmune diseases like uveitis. Here, we investigate whether in uveitis immune cells become associated with the lens capsule and compromise its privilege in studies of C57BL/6J mice with experimental autoimmune uveitis. These studies show that at D14, the peak of uveitis in these mice, T cells, macrophages, and Ly6G/Ly6C+ immune cells associate with the lens basement membrane capsule, burrow into the capsule matrix, and remain integrated with the capsule as immune resolution is occurring at D26. 3D surface rendering image analytics of confocal z-stacks and scanning electron microscopy imaging of the lens surface show the degradation of the lens capsule as these lens-associated immune cells integrate with and invade the lens capsule, with a subset infiltrating both epithelial and fiber cell regions of lens tissue, abrogating its immune privilege. Those immune cells that remain on the surface often become entwined with a fibrillar net-like structure. Immune cell invasion of the lens capsule in uveitis has not been described previously and may play a role in induction of lens and other eye pathologies associated with autoimmunity."
https://openalex.org/W4200089903,"Barth syndrome (BTHS) is an inherited mitochondrial disorder characterized by a decrease in total cardiolipin and the accumulation of its precursor monolysocardiolipin due to the loss of the transacylase enzyme tafazzin. However, the molecular basis of BTHS pathology is still not well understood. Here we characterize the double mutant pgc1Δtaz1Δ of Saccharomyces cerevisiae deficient in phosphatidylglycerol-specific phospholipase C and tafazzin as a new yeast model of BTHS. Unlike the taz1Δ mutant used to date, this model accumulates phosphatidylglycerol, thus better approximating the human BTHS cells. We demonstrate that increased phosphatidylglycerol in this strain leads to more pronounced mitochondrial respiratory defects and an increased incidence of aberrant mitochondria compared to the single taz1Δ mutant. We also show that the mitochondria of the pgc1Δtaz1Δ mutant exhibit a reduced rate of respiration due to decreased cytochrome c oxidase and ATP synthase activities. Finally, we determined that the mood-stabilizing anticonvulsant valproic acid has a positive effect on both lipid composition and mitochondrial function in these yeast BTHS models. Overall, our results show that the pgc1Δtaz1Δ mutant better mimics the cellular phenotype of BTHS patients than taz1Δ cells, both in terms of lipid composition and the degree of disruption of mitochondrial structure and function. This favors the new model for use in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W4200283602,"Glutamate decarboxylase (GAD; EC 4.1.1.15) catalyzes the irreversible decarboxylation of glutamate to produce γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA); a ubiquitous non-protein amino acid involved in the regulation of several aspects of plant metabolism and physiology. To study the function of GAD and GABA in maize, we have; 1) introduced native and deregulated forms of AtGAD1 into maize with the intent of increasing the synthesis of GABA and 2) introduced constructs into maize designed to suppress the activity of several GABA shunt, GABA transport and GABA pathway genes. Maize plants expressing the deregulated AtGAD1 exhibit a severe chlorosis and retarded growth phenotype and have high levels of GABA, and Ca++/CaM-independent GAD activity. Plants expressing the suppression constructs for GABA biosynthetic and transport pathway genes had no observable phenotype whereas a knockout of GABA catabolic pathway genes led to growth and developmental defects under standard growth conditions. The implications of this study to our understanding of the action and function of GABA and GAD in crops are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3148173996,"The occurrence of postoperative neurocognitive deficits(POND)after major cardiac surgery is associated with an increase in perioperative mortality and morbidity. Oxidative stress caused by oxygen can affect neuronal damage, which can lead to POND. Whether the intraoperative rSO2 value reflects oxidative stress and the associated incidence of POND is unknown.Among 3482 patients undergoing cardiac surgery, 976 patients were allocated for this retrospective study. Of these, 230 patients (32.5%) were observed to have postoperative neurologic symptoms. After propensity score 1:2 ratio matching, a total of 690 patients were included in the analysis. Recorded data on the occurrence of POND from the postoperative period to predischarge were collected from the electronic records.The mean baseline rSO2 value was higher in the POND (-) group than in the POND (+) group. The mean overall minimum rSO2 value was lower in the POND (+) group (52.2 ± 8.3 vs 48.3 ± 10.5, P < 0.001). The mean overall maximum rSO2 values were not significantly different between the two groups (72.7 ± 8.3 vs 73.2 ± 9.2, P = 0.526). However, there was a greater increase in the overall maximum rSO2 values as compared with baseline in the POND (+) group (10.9 ± 8.2 vs 17.9 ± 10.2, P < 0.001). The degree of increase in the maximum rSO2 value was a risk factor affecting the occurrence of POND (adjusted odds ratio, 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.11; P < 0.001). The areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve for delta values of minimal and maximal compared with baseline values were 0.60 and 0.71, respectively.Increased cerebral oximeter levels during cardiac surgery may also be a risk factor for POND. This is considered to reflect the possibility of oxidative neuronal damage, and further studies are needed in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3216350313,"Inflammasome signaling results in cell death and release of cytokines from the IL-1 family, which facilitates control over an infection. However, some pathogens such as Salmonella typhimurium (ST) activate various innate immune signaling pathways, including inflammasomes, yet evade these cell death mechanisms, resulting in a chronic infection. Here we investigated inflammasome signaling induced by acute and chronic isolates of ST obtained from different organs. We show that ST isolated from infected mice during the acute phase displays an increased potential to activate inflammasome signaling, which then undergoes a protracted decline during the chronic phase of infection. This decline in inflammasome signaling was associated with reduced expression of virulence factors, including flagella and the Salmonella pathogenicity island I genes. This reduction in cell death of macrophages induced by chronic isolates had the greatest impact on the NLRP3 inflammasome, which correlated with a reduction in caspase-1 activation. Furthermore, rapid cell death induced by Casp-1/11 by ST in macrophages limited the subsequent activation of cell death cascade proteins Casp-8, RipK1, RipK3, and MLKL to prevent the activation of alternative forms of cell death. We observed that the lack of the ability to induce cell death conferred a competitive fitness advantage to ST only during the acute phase of infection. Finally, we show that the chronic isolates displayed a significant attenuation in their ability to infect mice through the oral route. These results reveal that ST adapts during chronic infection by circumventing inflammasome recognition to promote the survival of both the host and the pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W4200339471,"This paper aims to identify the determinants of the length of stay (LoS) of international tourists in Norway. The paper reassesses the standard assumption related to tourists' LoS; it refers to the travel industry's current trends, and it postulates a more sustainable approach to analyzing tourists' LoS at the destination level. The paper concludes with a series of recommendations. The data for this study were collected during 153 data collection days and among 5,300 travelers in Norway. The determinants of LoS were analyzed by means of an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. The results indicate that tourists' LoS is positively related to their age, interests (nature-based tourists), origin (German, Dutch tourists) and mode of travel organization (package tourists). A negative and significant effect on tourists' LoS was found for tourists' interests (urban-based tourists), spending, and origin (home market, long-haul tourists). No significant results were revealed for two covariates, namely, gender and repeat visitation."
