https://openalex.org/W2049151491,Since 1968 a significant increase in total chlorophyll a in the water column during the summer in the central North Pacific Ocean has been observed. A concomitant increase in winter winds and a decrease in sea surface temperature suggest that long-period fluctuations in atmospheric characteristics have changed the carrying capacity of the central Pacific epipelagic ecosystem.
https://openalex.org/W2077967170,"Insectivorous bats have influenced the development of antipredator behavior in moths, green lacewings, crickets, and mantids; until recently, such adaptations were unknown in katydids. Foliage-gleaning bats in Panama can use the female-attracting, airborne calling songs of nocturnal katydids to locate prey. They also feed heavily on these insects. Katydid species sympatric with these bats exhibit markedly reduced calling song duty cycles. Males supplement shortened songs with complex, species-specific tremulations that generate vibrations that are inaudible to bats but reach conspecific females through a shared plant substrate. Female katydids do not call audibly but are also preyed on in large numbers, perhaps as a result of moving toward calling males."
https://openalex.org/W1965610512,"To identify the forces directing organismal evolution, a general analytical system is developed to synthesize structuralist and Darwinian traditions in an explicitly historical framework. Morphological features of lungless salamanders are examined to identify hierarchical systems of developmental and functional constraint on evolution and their interactions with processes at the genic and populational levels. Characteristic patterns of change occur repeatedly in the evolutionary history of this group."

The x-ray flare is large in extent, has fine strulctuire, and follows a neutral magnetic line. X-ray emitting coronal links interconnect active regions. The general coronal emission at the limb and several faint regions on the disc are observed."

The first scientific attempt at an explanation was by Helmholtz about one hundred years ago, and was based on the force most familiar to physicists at the time, gravitation. When a gram of matter falls to the sun's surface it gets a potential energy Epot = −GM/R = −1.91×1015 erg/gm (1) where M = 1.99×1033 gm is the sun's mass, R = 6.96×1010 cm its radius, and G = 6.67×10−8 the gravitational constant. A similar energy was set free when the sun was assembled from intersellar gas or dust in the dim past; actually somewhat more, because most of the sun's material is located closer to its center, and therefore has a numerically larger potential energy. One‐half of the energy set free is transformed into kinetic energy according to the well‐known virial theorem of mechanics. This will permit us later to estimate the temperature in the sun. The other half of the potential energy is radiated away. We know that at present the su..."

A 4-centimeter tungsten-carbon multilayer mirror was flown as part of an experimental solar rocket payload, and successful images were taken of the sun at normal incidence at a wavelength of 44 angstroms. Coronal Si-XII emission from an active region was recorded on film; as expected, the structure is very similar to that observed at O-VIII wavelengths by the Solar Maximum Mission flat crystal spectrometer at the same time. The small, simple optical system used in this experiment appears to have achieved a resolution of 5 to 10 arc seconds."
https://openalex.org/W2059890353,"Two experiments are described where an apparent decrease in frequency was detected when the optical path was in the vicinity of a mass. In the first experiment the 21-centimeter absorption line from Taurus A was observed near occultation by the sun. In the second experiment the frequency of a portable cesium clock was compared with the frequency of a similar clock which transmits its signals from Cape Fear, North Carolina. A decrease of frequency of the received signals as a function of the distance between the two clocks was apparent. Several relevant observations (the red shift of lines from the sun, the Mossbauer determination of the gravitational red shift, and the cosmological red shift, are discussed in view of the present results."
https://openalex.org/W1977481175,"The satellites of Jupiter eclipsed each other in 1985, and these events allowed an unusual measurement of the sodium in Io's extended atmosphere. Europa was used as a mirror to look back through the Io atmosphere at the sun. The measured column abundances suggest that the atmosphere is collisionally thin above 700 kilometers and may be collisionally thin to the surface. The sodium radial profile above 700 kilometers resembles a 1500 kelvin exosphere with a surface density near 2 × 104 sodium atoms per cubic centimeter, but a complete explanation of the dynamics requires a more complex nonthermal model: the calculated loss rates suggest that the atmosphere is being replaced on a time scale of hours."

In contrast, the short nonhelical sequences in the two proteins, although homologous, differ appreciably in structure. The requirements of the collagen helix and the numerous intermolecular interactions characteristic of collagen may restrict the number of functionally acceptable amino acid replacements occurring during evolution."

https://openalex.org/W2020629221,"Classical hydromagnetic theory predicts that the flow of dilute aqueous electrolyte in a slit can be stabilized by application of a strong, transverse magnetic field. However, recent experiments indicate that stabilization can be achieved with the use of a much weaker field in the presence of a small lateral current. A revised theory describes how the magnetic and electric fields interact to eliminate natural convection."

The cause of the spruce decline is not yet known, although air pollution is generally believed to have contributed."
