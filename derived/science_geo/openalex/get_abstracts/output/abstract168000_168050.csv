https://openalex.org/W2089632738,"The functional architecture of the object vision pathway in the human brain was investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure patterns of response in ventral temporal cortex while subjects viewed faces, cats, five categories of man-made objects, and nonsense pictures. A distinct pattern of response was found for each stimulus category. The distinctiveness of the response to a given category was not due simply to the regions that responded maximally to that category, because the category being viewed also could be identified on the basis of the pattern of response when those regions were excluded from the analysis. Patterns of response that discriminated among all categories were found even within cortical regions that responded maximally to only one category. These results indicate that the representations of faces and objects in ventral temporal cortex are widely distributed and overlapping."
https://openalex.org/W2052986837,"Despite extensive evidence for regions of human visual cortex that respond selectively to faces, few studies have considered the cortical representation of the appearance of the rest of the human body. We present a series of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies revealing substantial evidence for a distinct cortical region in humans that responds selectively to images of the human body, as compared with a wide range of control stimuli. This region was found in the lateral occipitotemporal cortex in all subjects tested and apparently reflects a specialized neural system for the visual perception of the human body."

Here, we demonstrate a role for blood vessels as a source of developmental signals during pancreatic organogenesis. In vitro experiments with embryonic mouse tissues demonstrate that blood vessel endothelium induces insulin expression in isolated endoderm. Removal of the dorsal aorta in Xenopus laevis embryos results in the failure of insulin expression in vivo. Furthermore, using transgenic mice, we show that ectopic vascularization in the posterior foregut leads to ectopic insulin expression and islet hyperplasia. These results indicate that vessels not only provide metabolic sustenance, but also provide inductive signals for organ development."
https://openalex.org/W1980247655,"The embryonic role of endothelial cells and nascent vessels in promoting organogenesis, prior to vascular function, is unclear. We find that early endothelial cells in mouse embryos surround newly specified hepatic endoderm and delimit the mesenchymal domain into which the liver bud grows. In flk-1 mutant embryos, which lack endothelial cells, hepatic specification occurs, but liver morphogenesis fails prior to mesenchyme invasion. We developed an embryo tissue explant system that permits liver bud vasculogenesis and show that in the absence of endothelial cells, or when the latter are inhibited, there is a selective defect in hepatic outgrowth. We conclude that vasculogenic endothelial cells and nascent vessels are critical for the earliest stages of organogenesis, prior to blood vessel function."
https://openalex.org/W2099040294,"The oxidation of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins and cell membrane lipids is believed to play an integral role in the development of fatty streak lesions, an initial step in atherogenesis. We have previously shown that two antioxidant-like enzymes, paraoxonase (PON)-1 and PON3, are high density lipoprotein-associated proteins capable of preventing the oxidative modification of low density lipoprotein (LDL) (Reddy, S. T., Wadleigh, D. J., Grijalva, V., Ng, C., Hama, S., Gangopadhyay, A., Shih, D. M., Lusis, A. J., Navab, M., and Fogelman, A. M. (2001)Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 21, 542–547). In the present study, we demonstrate that PON2 (i) is not associated with high density lipoprotein; (ii) has antioxidant properties; and (iii) prevents LDL lipid peroxidation, reverses the oxidation of mildly oxidized LDL (MM-LDL), and inhibits the ability of MM-LDL to induce monocyte chemotaxis. The PON2 protein was overexpressed in HeLa cells using the tetracycline-inducible (“Tet-On”) system, and its antioxidant capacity was measured in a fluorometric assay. Cells that overexpressed PON2 showed significantly less intracellular oxidative stress following treatment with hydrogen peroxide or oxidized phospholipid. Moreover, cells that overexpressed PON2 were also less effective in oxidizing and modifying LDL and, in fact, were able to reverse the effects of preformed MM-LDL. Our results suggest that PON2 possesses antioxidant properties similar to those of PON1 and PON3. However, in contrast to PON1 and PON3, PON2 may exert its antioxidant functions at the cellular level, joining the host of intracellular antioxidant enzymes that protect cells from oxidative stress.

The anti-atherogenic properties associated with HDL are due, at least in part, to the activity of HDL-associated enzymes, which interact with LDL and prevent and/or reverse its oxidation (6Navab M.

The calcium-dependent ester hydrolase paraoxonase (PON)-1 (EC 3.1.8.1) is one of several such enzymes and is found tightly associated with apoA-I in the HDL particle (7La Du B.N. Kulow W.

Epidemiological studies have shown that PON1 polymorphisms are correlated with variations in plasma lipoprotein levels (10Fanella S. Harris S.B. Young T.K. Hanley A.J. Zinman B. Connelly P.W.

Lancet. 1997; 349: 851-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) showed that alloenzymes of PON1 determine the effectiveness of HDL in the protection of LDL from lipid peroxidation. Two other members of the PON gene family, termed PON2 and PON3, have been identified (17Primo-Parmo S.L. Sorenson R.C. Teiber J. La Du B.N. Genomics. 1996; 33: 498-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). The three PON genes share ∼65% similarity at the amino acid level and are located adjacent to each other on chromosome 7 in humans and chromosome 6 in mice. Like PON1, PON3 is also found in HDL and not only prevents the formation of MM-LDL, but also inhibits MM-LDL-induced monocyte chemotactic activity (18Reddy S.T. Wadleigh D.J. Grijalva V. Ng C. Hama S. Gangopadhyay A. Shih D.M. Lusis A.J. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 19La Du B.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 467-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Although the expression of PON1 and PON3 is restricted primarily to the liver, PON2 is more widely expressed and is found in a number of tissues, including brain, liver, kidney, and testis (20Mochizuki H. Scherer S.W. Xi T. Nickle D.C. Majer M. Huizenga J.J. Tsui L.C. Prochazka M. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 213: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Furthermore, like PON1, PON2 polymorphisms are associated with numerous pathophysiological conditions, including variations in plasma lipoproteins (21Boright A.P. Connelly P.W. Brunt J.H.

Genet. 1998; 62: 36-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Although a genetic association between PON2 and these conditions has been shown, the exact function of PON2 in humans is not known. The high similarity observed in amino acid sequence between the PON proteins suggests that PON2 may possess a biochemical function similar to that of PON1 and PON3. In this study, we demonstrate that PON2, although being widely expressed in many different human tissues, is not detectable by Western analysis in either HDL or LDL. We found that PON2 is constitutively expressed in both primary and immortalized human endothelial cells and human aortic smooth muscle cells. Furthermore, we show that PON2 has antioxidant properties. PON2 overexpression lowers the intracellular oxidative state of cells that have been treated with either hydrogen peroxide or oxidizedl-α-1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (Ox-PAPC). Cells that overexpress PON2 also oxidatively modify LDL to a lesser extent than control cells, as measured by the accumulation of LDL lipid hydroperoxides and the ability of the LDL to induce monocyte chemotactic activity in human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC). Furthermore, cells that overexpress PON2 are able to reverse the oxidative modification of MM-LDL. MM-LDL that has been incubated with cells that overexpress PON2 shows lower levels of lipid hydroperoxides and is less able to induce monocyte chemotaxis than MM-LDL that has been incubated with control cells. Our data suggest that PON2 may play an anti-atherogenic role by reducing the oxidation of LDL and/or by reducing the production of intracellular hydroperoxides. Cell culture reagents and oligonucleotides were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Human tissue blot containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA in each lane was from Origene Technologies Inc. (Rockville, MD).l-α-1-Palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Ox-PAPC was prepared as described previously (26Watson A.D. Leitinger N. Navab M. Faull K.F. Horkko S. Witztum J.L. Palinski W. Schwenke D. Salomon R.G. Sha W. Subbanagounder G. Fogelman A.M. Berliner J.A. J. Biol.

LDL (d = 1.019–1.063 g/ml) and HDL (d = 1.063–1.21 g/ml) were isolated by ultracentrifugation (27Havel R.J. Elder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 43: 1345-1353Crossref Scopus (6498) Google Scholar) from the plasma of normal volunteers after obtaining informed consent according to the Human Research Subject Protection Committee of UCLA. LDL and HDL had endotoxin levels below 20 pg/ml. 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA) was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). HeLa “Tet-On” cells (CLONTECH) were grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% tetracycline-free fetal bovine serum. HAEC and human aortic smooth muscle cells were isolated and cultured as described previously (5Navab M. Imes S.S. Hama S.Y. Hough G.P. Ross L.A. Bork R.W. Valente A.J. Berliner J.A. Drinkwater D.C. Laks H. Fogelman A.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 2039-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar) and used at passage levels 4–6. Monocytes were isolated by a modification of the “Recalde” method as previously described (28Fogelman A.M. Sykes K. Van Lenten B.J. Territo M.C. Berliner J.A. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 1243-1247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from the blood of normal volunteers after obtaining written consent under a protocol approved by the Human Research Subject Protection Committee of UCLA. Human microcirculatory endothelial cells (HMEC) were grown in MCDB-131 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine, and endothelial cell growth supplement. Based on the available sequence information in the NCBI Databases, specific primers were designed to amplify the complete coding sequences of PON2. The PON2-specific primers along with HepG2 cell total RNA (1 μg) were subjected to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using the Access RT-PCR system kit from Promega (Madison, WI). The upper and lower primers for human PON2 were 5′-ATTAGTCGACGCGCATGGTGGCTGTGGGCTTG-3′ and 5′-ATAGTTTAGCGGCCGCTTAGAGTTCACAATACAAG-3′, respectively. In each set of primers, the upper primers contained a SalI restriction site on the 5′-end, and the lower primer had aNotI restriction site on the 3′-end. Following reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, the products were identified on agarose gel and cloned into the pCRII vector with a TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Multiple clones containing the PON2 cDNA were sequenced at Laragen (Los Angeles, CA). The sequences were aligned with the PON2 sequence available in the NCBI Databases using the MacVector and Assemblyalign programs. TheSalI/NotI fragment containing PON2 was excised from the TA vector and cloned into pGEX-6p2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Escherichia coli BL21 bacteria were transformed with the resulting GST plasmid, and GST fusion proteins were prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol. This GST-PON2 fusion protein was verified by size on polyacrylamide gel. Antibody generation for the PON1 and PON3 proteins was described previously (18Reddy S.T. Wadleigh D.J. Grijalva V. Ng C. Hama S. Gangopadhyay A. Shih D.M. Lusis A.J. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The anti-PON2 antibody was generated similarly. Briefly, the peptide CKEEKPRARELRISRGFDL for PON2 was synthesized at the UCLA Peptide Synthesis Core Facility. This peptide was chosen based on its hydrophilicity as well as its high level of specificity for PON2, but not PON1 or PON3. The cysteine residue in the N terminus of this peptide is not part of the original PON2 sequence, but was added to the PON2 peptide to facilitate conjugation to carrier protein. 2 mg of each peptide was conjugated to 2 mg of keyhole limpet hemocyanin using the Imject Maleimide-activated KLH kit (Pierce), and the keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptide was purified according to the manufacturer's protocol. A rabbit polyclonal antibody against the PON2-conjugated peptide was developed at Cocalico Biologicals (Reamstown, PA). The antibody was tested for specificity using recombinant human PON1, GST-PON1, GST-PON2, and GST-PON3 proteins (data not shown). A series of dilutions for primary antibodies were used. For testing the antibodies on GST-PON fusion proteins, antibody dilutions of 1:10,000 were used. Subsequently, a 1:1000 dilution was established for the anti-PON2 antibody for Western analysis of cell culture lysates. HeLa Tet-On cells were cotransfected with linearized pTRE-PON2 and pBabe-Puro (puromycin-resistant plasmid) using Superfect reagent (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA). The day after transfection, the cultures were given medium containing 0.1 μg/ml puromycin. After 14 days, puromycin-resistant clones were collected and combined to make a heterogeneous stable population, which was subsequently aliquoted and frozen for storage. To test for doxycycline inducibility, an aliquot of these cells was thawed, plated, and expanded in high glucose Dulbecco's modified essential medium containing 10% tetracycline-free fetal bovine serum in the presence of 200 μg/ml G418 and 0.1 μg/ml puromycin. Cells were then either left untreated or treated with 2 μg/ml doxycycline for 48 h (two treatments of 24 h each). Total RNA and cell lysates from these cells were harvested and analyzed for PON2 mRNA and protein expression, respectively, as detailed below. Total RNA from cell cultures was purified using the RNeasy kit (QIAGEN Inc.). 10 μg of total RNA (or 2.5 μg from HeLa-Tet-PON2 cells) was subjected to electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel, transferred to Hybond-N membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and hybridized with cDNA probes for human PON2 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Electrophoresis and hybridization protocols were described previously (29Reddy S.T. Winstead M. Tischfield J.A. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13591-13596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Protein samples were fractionated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a semidry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween, and 5% nonfat dried milk for 1 h; washed three times (5 min/wash) with Tris-buffered saline; and then incubated with rabbit anti-human PON2 polyclonal antibody diluted 1:1000 in Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween, and 1% bovine serum albumin for 2 h. Membranes were washed three times (10 min/wash) with Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween, and 1% nonfat dried milk and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 1:4000 dilution for 1 h. Membranes were again washed three times and then detected using an ECL Western blotting kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the manufacturer's suggested protocol. Equal amounts (1.4 μg of cholesterol) of ultracentrifugation-isolated HDL and LDL were loaded to determine the presence of PON2 in human lipoproteins. 50 μg of protein from cell extracts was used to determine the presence of PON2 in HMEC. 0.25 μg of purified human PON1 and GST-PON2 were tested as controls (data not shown). 25 μg of HeLa-Tet-PON2 cell extracts (untreated or treated for 48 h with doxycycline at 2 μg/ml) were used to determine whether doxycycline induction of these cells resulted in an increase in PON2 protein. To isolate the plasma membrane fraction, confluent plates of HeLa-Tet-PON2 cells were scraped in 1× phosphate-buffered saline and lysed using a Polytron homogenizer. Lysed cells were then spun at 5000 × g for 20 min to remove the nuclear pellet from the rest of the cell extract. This nucleus-free cell extract was subsequently spun at 20,000 × g for 30 min, and the resulting plasma membrane pellet was resuspended in Laemmli buffer. ∼13 μg (by protein) of this plasma membrane sample was loaded to detect PON2 in the plasma membrane fraction. Cell supernatants were concentrated ∼10-fold by filtering through anMr 10,000 cutoff filter (Centricon-10). 50 μg of protein was used to determine the presence of PON2 in cell supernatants. Intracellular oxidative stress was measured by the dichlorofluorescein assay as described by Wang and Joseph (30Wang H. Joseph J.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 612-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa-Tet-PON2 and HeLa Tet-On cells were plated onto 96-well plates and treated with or without doxycycline for 48 h. Cells were washed with Krebs-Ringer buffer and subsequently incubated in Dulbecco's modified essential medium containing 100 μm DCFH-DA and 1% tetracycline-free fetal bovine serum in 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. 1 h later, DCFH-DA was removed, and cells were washed with Krebs-Ringer buffer. 300 μm hydrogen peroxide in Krebs-Ringer buffer was added to the cells, and fluorescence was measured in a fluorescent plate reader (Spectra Max Gemini XS, Molecular Devices) with the temperature maintained at 37 °C. Softmax Pro881 (Molecular Devices) and Excel (Microsoft) software were used for data analysis. HeLa-Tet-PON2 and HeLa Tet-On cells were treated with or without doxycycline at 2 μg/ml for 48 h. Cells were incubated with human LDL (250 μg/ml protein) isolated by ultracentrifugation. 24 h later, this MM-LDL was re-isolated from the cell supernatants using an Mr 100,000 cutoff filter (Millipore Corp.) and reconstituted to the initial concentration (250 μg/ml) in M199 medium. MM-LDL was then added to a monolayer of confluent HAEC and incubated for 18 h. Supernatants were collected, diluted 1:20, and tested for monocyte chemotaxis as described previously (3Navab M. Hama S.Y. Cooke C.J. Anantharamaiah G.M. Chadda M. Jin L. Subbanagounder G. Faull K.F. Reddy S.T. Miller N.E. Fogelman A.M. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1481-1494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The number of migrated monocytes was determined microscopically and expressed as the means ± S.D. of 12 standardized high power fields counted in quadruplicate. For lipid hydroperoxide quantitation, the MM-LDL lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol, and hydroperoxides were quantified by the method described by Auerbach et al. (31Auerbach B.J. Kiely J.S. Cornicelli J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). PON2 mRNA was ubiquitously expressed in nearly every human tissue tested, with the highest expression seen in the liver, lung, placenta, testis, and heart (Fig.1). The high PON2 expression noted in the human heart and the genetic association seen between PON2 polymorphisms and coronary artery disease suggest that PON2 may be expressed in the cells of the aortic environment, where it could play a local anti-atherogenic role. To test this hypothesis, total RNA was harvested from HAEC, HMEC, and human aortic smooth muscle cells and subjected to Northern analysis using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction-amplified human PON2 cDNA as probe. We found that PON2 message was expressed in all of these cells associated with the artery wall (Fig. 2) and in primary macrophages as well (data not shown), whereas neither PON1 nor PON3 message was detectable in these cells (data not shown).Figure 2Expression of PON2 message in artery wall cells. Total RNA was harvested from cultured immortalized HMEC, primary HAEC, and primary human arterial smooth muscle cells (HASMC); and 10 μg of each RNA sample was loaded onto a 1.1% agarose gel and subjected to electrophoresis and to Northern analysis using a 32P-labeled PON2 cDNA. To control for RNA loading, this filter was stripped and reprobed with a32P-labeled glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) PON1 and PON3 proteins are found in HDL particles and may account for at least some of the antioxidant effects ascribed to HDL (18Reddy S.T. Wadleigh D.J. Grijalva V. Ng C. Hama S. Gangopadhyay A. Shih D.M. Lusis A.J. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Indeed, we were able to detect the PON1 protein in ultracentrifuge-isolated HDL (Fig. 3, left panel). To determine whether PON2 is associated with human plasma lipoprotein fractions, Western analysis of HDL and LDL fractions was performed using the anti-PON2 antibody. As a positive control for detection of the PON2 protein, we loaded whole cell extract isolated from HMEC. We detected an ∼44-kDa protein in HMEC extracts that was not detected using preimmune antiserum. The specificity of the anti-PON2 antibody was also confirmed by immunodepletion of anti-PON2 antiserum with a PON2-specific peptide (data not shown). No PON2-specific band was detectable by Western analysis in either HDL or LDL (Fig. 3,middle panel). To further facilitate study of the human PON2 enzyme, we constructed HeLa-Tet-PON2, an immortalized human cervical carcinoma cell line that overexpresses the tetracycline Tet-On transcriptional activator, into which a plasmid containing the human PON2 cDNA under control of the tetracycline response element was stably transfected. As would be expected given the ubiquitous expression of PON2, HeLa cells express endogenous PON2 constitutively at a moderate level. Upon treatment for 48 h with 2 μg/ml doxycycline (an analog for tetracycline), the HeLa-Tet-PON2 cells dramatically overexpressed PON2 message (Fig.4 A) and protein (Fig.4 B). To determine whether PON2 is secreted in detectable amounts into the cell culture medium or remains associated with specific cellular fractions, we performed Western analysis on concentrated tissue culture medium, total cellular extract, and a plasma membrane subfraction obtained from HeLa-Tet-PON2 cell cultures. We found that PON2 protein was not detectable in concentrated tissue culture medium, whereas it was detected in both the HeLa-Tet-PON2 total cellular extract and the plasma membrane subfraction (Fig.4 C). We have previously shown that both PON1 and PON3 have antioxidant properties and are capable of preventing the formation of MM-LDL and inactivating preformed MM-LDL (18Reddy S.T. Wadleigh D.J. Grijalva V. Ng C. Hama S. Gangopadhyay A. Shih D.M. Lusis A.J. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Given the high degree of sequence similarity seen between the three PON proteins, it is likely that PON2 possesses an enzymatic activity similar to that of PON1 and PON3. However, since PON2 is not detectable by Western analysis in HDL (unlike PON1 and PON3) and in cell culture supernatants, we hypothesized that PON2 may provide an innate cellular antioxidant activity. Wang and Joseph (30Wang H. Joseph J.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 612-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar) have reported the use of DCFH-DA to measure intracellular oxidative stress. This assay quantifies the fluorescence emitted when the non-fluorescent DCFH-DA is oxidized to the highly fluorescent dichlorofluorescein by intracellular reactive oxygen species. HeLa-Tet-PON2 cells that had been either left untreated or pretreated for 48 h with 2 μg/ml doxycycline were incubated with 100 μm DCFH-DA for 1 h and subsequently treated with hydrogen peroxide (300 μm) to generate reactive oxygen species. The fluorescence emitted following treatment with hydrogen peroxide was significantly lower in doxycycline-induced HeLa-Tet-PON2 cells overexpressing PON2 protein relative to control untreated HeLa-Tet-PON2 cells (Fig. 5,upper panel). The fluorescence emitted from cells treated with Ox-PAPC, which mimics the biological activity of MM-LDL (26Watson A.D. Leitinger N. Navab M. Faull K.F. Horkko S. Witztum J.L. Palinski W. Schwenke D.

Chem. 1997; 272: 13597-13607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar), followed a similar trend (Fig. 5, lower panel). No significant difference in emitted fluorescence was observed between doxycycline-treated and untreated HeLa Tet-On cells following hydrogen peroxide or Ox-PAPC incubation (data not shown), indicating that the change in fluorescence resulting from PON2 overexpression was not a result of a possible cell growth difference induced by the doxycycline treatment. These experiments show that PON2 overexpression has an antioxidant effect in cells treated with hydrogen peroxide or Ox-PAPC. We have previously shown that MM-LDL contains elevated levels of lipid hydroperoxides and is capable of inducing monocyte chemotactic activity in target cells (3Navab M. Hama S.Y. Cooke C.J. Anantharamaiah G.M. Chadda M. Jin L. Subbanagounder G. Faull K.F. Reddy S.T. Miller N.E. Fogelman A.M. J.

In addition, we have previously demonstrated that HDL, purified PON1, and supernatants from cells overexpressing PON1 or PON3 protein can inhibit the oxidative modification of LDL by HAEC (18Reddy S.T. Wadleigh D.J. Grijalva V. Ng C. Hama S. Gangopadhyay A. Shih D.M. Lusis A.J. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Since PON2 lowers the oxidative state of cells treated with hydrogen peroxide or Ox-PAPC, we wanted to determine whether cells that overexpress PON2 would oxidize LDL to a lower degree than control cells. We found that LDL that was incubated with doxycycline-induced HeLa-Tet-PON2 cells exhibited lower levels of lipid hydroperoxides (Fig. 6 A, left panel) relative to LDL that had been incubated with untreated HeLa-Tet-PON2 cells or control HeLa Tet-On cells. Furthermore, as would be expected, this LDL was less effective in inducing monocyte chemotactic activity (Fig. 6 A, right panel). PON2 not only repressed the formation of oxidative modifications on LDL, but was also able to reverse the oxidation of preformed MM-LDL. MM-LDL that had been incubated with doxycycline-induced HeLa-Tet-PON2 cells had a significantly lower level of lipid hydroperoxide modifications than MM-LDL that had been incubated with untreated HeLa-Tet-PON2 cells or control HeLa Tet-On cells (Fig. 6 B,left panel). As would be expected, the ability of this MM-LDL to induce monocyte chemotactic activity was also impaired (Fig.6 B, right panel). These results demonstrate that similar to PON1 and PON3, PON2 functions as an antioxidant enzyme. PON2 overexpression is capable of lowering the oxidative state of cells induced by hydrogen peroxide or Ox-PAPC treatment. Furthermore, PON2 overexpression prevents as well as reverses the cell-mediated oxidative modification of LDL and therefore blocks the ability of MM-LDL to induce monocyte chemotaxis. We recently demonstrated that PON3, like PON1, is associated with the HDL particle and plays an anti-atherogenic role (18Reddy S.T. Wadleigh D.J. Grijalva V. Ng C. Hama S. Gangopadhyay A. Shih D.M. Lusis A.J. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). We detected PON1 and PON3 proteins by Western analysis in HDL particles isolated by numerous methods (ultracentrifugation, fast protein liquid chromatography, “dextran-isolated”) and in human plasma. We were not able to detect PON2 protein by Western analysis in any of these samples. This could be a true reflection either that PON2 does not exist in the HDL particle or that PON2 may be present in HDL at such a low level that it is undetectable by this method. We are currently undertaking further approaches to definitely determine whether PON2 exists in HDL. Both PON1 and PON3 are highly expressed in the liver, where they may associate with apoA-I and hence would likely be inserted into the forming HDL or pre-HDL particle. PON2, on the other hand, appears to be ubiquitously expressed in most human tissues. The high degree of sequence similarity between the PON proteins suggests that they share a similar enzymatic activity. However, the ubiquitous expression of PON2 and our finding that PON2 is not detectable in HDL by Western analysis suggest that PON2 may play a distinct role in vivo, separate from that played by PON1 and PON3. Although PON2 (like PON1 and PON3) does possess a putative consensus “signal sequence” in its N-terminal region, we did not detect PON2 protein by Western analysis even in concentrated cell culture supernatants from HeLa-Tet-PON2 cells. The PON2 protein may be rapidly degraded following secretion, or it may be secreted only at a very low level. Indeed, the global expression pattern of PON2 and our finding that PON2 is found in the plasma membrane fraction suggest that PON2 may provide an innate antioxidant activity in most cells, independent of secretion. Although oxidized LDL can readily enter cells by cell-surface receptors, it is unclear if oxidized lipids such as Ox-PAPC are able to freely diffuse across the cell membrane or may be actively internalized by a receptor-mediated mechanism. It is clear, however, that these oxidized lipids and lipoproteins would at least interact with the plasma membrane, and the localization of PON2 to the plasma membrane would therefore provide an ideal venue for the inactivation/reduction of these oxidized molecules. Indeed, our finding that PON2 overexpression is able to lower the intracellular oxidative state of cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide (which should easily diffuse through the cell membrane) or Ox-PAPC (which should at least easily interact with the cell membrane) suggests that PON2 can play just such a role. The in vitro paraoxonase and arylesterase assays have been typically used to determine the PON activity in human and animal serum samples. We have not been able to detect significant paraoxonase activity in extracts overexpressing PON2. However, since the arylesterase and paraoxonase activities of PON1 appear to be distinct and separable from its ability to protect against LDL oxidation (32Aviram M. Billecke S. Sorenson R. Bisgaier C. Newton R. Rosenblat M. Erogul J. Hsu C. Dunlop C. La Du B.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1617-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), the lack of an apparent paraoxonase activity in PON2 does not preclude it from possessing the ability to protect LDL from lipid peroxidation. Recent studies attribute a new in vitro enzymatic activity to the PON1 and PON3 proteins. Kobayashi et al. (33Kobayashi M. Shinohara M. Sakoh C. Kataoka M. Shimizu S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12787-12792Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) have reported the cloning of a lactone hydrolase (lactonase) fromFusarium oxysporum AKU 3702 and identified sequence similarities between lactonase and PON1; and indeed, lactonase activity may be commonly shared among the three PON proteins (34Dragonov D.I. Stetson P.L. Watson C.E. Billecke S.S. La Du B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33435-33442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is unlikely that these in vitro enzymatic activities are representative of the true function of the PON proteins in vivo. Mounting evidence suggests that the PON proteins play an anti-atherogenic role through their ability to inhibit and/or reverse LDL oxidation, and the ability of PON1 to accomplish this is clearly distinct from its in vitro arylesterase and paraoxonase activities. It is possible that the antioxidant activity of PON2 is similarly distinct from any in vitro paraoxonase, arylesterase, or lactonase activities it may possess. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that PON2 is able to lower the intracellular oxidative stress of a cell and prevent the cell-mediated oxidation of LDL. Since PON2 is ubiquitously expressed not just in cells of the artery environment, but in tissues throughout the body, it is likely that PON2 plays a role in the reduction of intracellular or local oxidative stress. Given that oxidation of LDL is thought to be a major initiator of atherosclerotic lesion development, it is likely that PON2 expression in arterial cells, in concert with the PON1 and PON3 proteins that are found in HDL, plays a key role in the body's resistance to coronary artery disease."

Frequently, however, constitutive activation of certain STAT family members, particularly Stat3, has accompanied a wide variety of human malignancies. To identify small molecule inhibitors of Stat3, we investigated the ability of the Stat3 SH2 domain-binding peptide, PY*LKTK (where Y* represents phosphotyrosine), to disrupt Stat3 activity in vitro. The presence of PY*LKTK, but not PYLKTK or PFLKTK, in nuclear extracts results in significant reduction in the levels of DNA binding activities of Stat3, to a lesser extent of Stat1, and with no effect on that of Stat5. Analyses of alanine scanning mutagenesis and deletion derivatives of PY*LKTK reveal that the Leu residue at the Y+1 position and a substituent at the Y−1 position (but not necessarily Pro) are essential for the disruption of active Stat3, thereby mapping the minimum active sequence to the tripeptide, XY*L. Studies involving bead-coupled PY*LKTK peptide demonstrate that this phosphopeptide directly complexes with Stat3 monomers in vitro, suggesting that PY*LKTK disrupts Stat3:Stat3 dimers. As evidence for the functional importance of peptide-directed inhibition of Stat3, PY*LKTK-mts (mts,membrane translocating sequence) selectively inhibits constitutive and ligand-induced Stat3 activationin vivo. Furthermore, PY*LKTK-mts suppresses transformation by the Src oncoprotein, which has been shown previously to require constitutive Stat3 activation.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3388) Google Scholar). Following ligand binding and activation of cytokine or growth factor receptors, STATs are recruited to the cytoplasmic portion of receptors where they are tyrosine-phosphorylated. Tyrosine kinases that mediate STAT phosphorylation and activation include growth factor receptors and cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, particularly Janus kinase and Src kinase families. Once tyrosine-phosphorylated, two STAT monomers form dimers through reciprocal phosphotyrosine-SH2 interactions, translocate to the nucleus, and bind to STAT-specific DNA-response elements of target genes to induce gene expression. To date, there are seven STAT family members identified in mammals, designated Stat1, Stat2, Stat3, Stat4, Stat5a, Stat5b, and Stat6. STATs have diverse normal biological functions, which include roles in cell differentiation, proliferation, development, apoptosis, and inflammation (7–18). In addition to their roles in normal cellular processes, some STATs have been observed to participate in signaling events that lead to oncogenic transformation. Constitutively active Stat3 is observed in transformation by v-Src, v-Eyk, v-Ros, v-Fps, Etk/BMX, and Lck, is associated with transformation by tumor viruses, including human T-cell lymphotrophic virus, type I, Epstein-Barr virus, and herpesvirus saimiri that activate Janus kinases or Src family tyrosine kinases (for reviews see Refs. 19Bowman T.

In the context of human tumors, there is a high frequency of activation of Stat1, Stat3, and Stat5, with higher incidence of abnormal Stat3 activation in almost all the human tumors studied.

Importantly, using in vivo tumor models, murine B16 melanoma tumors regress on inhibition of constitutive Stat3 activity by gene therapy with a Stat3 dominant negative (37Niu G. Heller R. Catlett-Falcone R. Coppola D. Jaroszeski M. Dalton W. Jove R. Yu H. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5059-5063PubMed Google Scholar). The “cancer causing” propensity of constitutively activated Stat3 and the evidence of potential clinical benefits of blocking constitutive Stat3 signaling make strong arguments for target validity of Stat3 for drug intervention in cancer therapy, providing the rationale for developing inhibitors of STAT signaling (reviewed in Ref. 25Turkson J. Jove R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6613-6626Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Among others, inhibitors of tyrosine kinases that participate in STAT signaling, such as Janus kinases, Src, and epidermal growth factor receptor, have been developed, with some of these already at different stages in clinical trials (38Levitzki A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 39Ben-Bassat H. Klein B. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2000; 6: 933-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 40Fry D.W.

Others include use of small molecule mimics of ligands for receptors that couple to STAT signaling (42Tian S.S. Lamb P. King A.G. Miller S.G. Kessler L. Luengo J.I. Averill L. Johnson R.K. Gleason J.G. Pelus L.M. Dillon S.B. Rosen J. Science. 1998; 281: 257-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). These approaches target components that are upstream of STAT signaling and thus have the potential of disrupting other signaling pathways in addition to STATs. We focused on identifying small molecules to target directly Stat3 that would serve as molecular tools for proof-of-concept testing, as well as leads for design of inhibitors of Stat3. In this regard, the ability of the Stat3 SH2 domain-binding phosphopeptide, PY*LKTK (where Y* represents phosphotyrosine), to disrupt activated Stat3 was investigated. Previous studies (43Shuai K.

We show that the presence of PY*LKTK and its tripeptide derivative sequences, PY*L and AY*L, in nuclear extracts results in dose-dependent reduction in Stat3 DNA binding activity in vitro. Furthermore, in vitro protein binding studies suggest that PY*LKTK but not PYLKTK forms inactive Stat3·PY*LKTK complexes, thus reducing levels of active Stat3:Stat3 dimers available to bind DNA. Significantly, in vivo studies to determine the functional importance of peptide-directed inhibition of Stat3 signaling that utilize PY*LKTK-mts (mts indicates membrane translocating sequence, a set of hydrophobic amino acids for membrane permeability) show that this Stat3-derived phosphopeptide selectively and potently inhibits Stat3 activation and transcriptional activity in intact cells. Furthermore, PY*LKTK-mts peptide also suppresses Src transformation that depends on constitutive Stat3, with no effect on Stat3-independent Ras transformation. Altogether, we have identified a minimal peptide that effectively abrogates Stat3 activity in vitro and suppresses both Stat3 signaling in vivo and cell transformation. These studies provide the basis for use of the Stat3 SH2 domain-binding phosphopeptide as a lead for design of novel peptidomimetic drugs targeting Stat3. Src-transformed NIH 3T3/v-Src fibroblasts have been described previously (47Yu C.L. Meyer D.J. Campbell G.S. Larner A.C. Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. Jove R.

NIH 3T3/v-Src/pLucTKS3 and NIH 3T3/v-Src/pRLSRE are stable clones that were generated by transfecting NIH 3T3/v-Src fibroblasts with pLucTKS3 or pRLSRE, respectively, and selecting for G418-resistant clones (49Turkson J.

In the case of NIH 3T3/v-Src/pLucTKS3/pRLSRE, pRLSRE was transfected into NIH 3T3/v-Src/pLucTKS3 cells, and stable Zeocin-resistant clones were selected. Transfections were carried out with LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Stat1 and Stat3 recombinant baculoviruses and infection of Sf-9 insect cells have been described previously (52Zhang Y. Turkson J. Carter-Su C. Smithgall T. Levitzki A. Kraker A. Krolewski J.J.

For infection, Sf-9 cells were plated at 1 × 106 cells/35-mm dish (6-well plates) in 2 ml of SF-900II serum-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubated at 27 °C for 1 h. Once cells were attached, the medium was replaced with 500 μl of infection mixture, which is SF-900II medium containing appropriately diluted baculoviruses, and allowed to incubate at 27 °C for 1 h with slow rocking. Subsequently, infection medium was replaced with fresh SF-900II, and cells were further incubated for 48 h before harvesting. Cytosolic extract preparation from fibroblasts and luciferase assays were described previously (23Turkson J. Bowman T. Garcia R. Caldenhoven E. De Groot R.P. Jove R. Mol. Cell.

Briefly, after two washes with PBS and equilibration for 5 min with 0.5 ml of PBS, 0.5 mm EDTA, cells were scraped off the dishes, and the cell pellet was obtained by centrifugation (4,500 × g, 2 min, 4 °C). Cells were resuspended in 0.4 ml of low salt HEPES buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 15 min, lysed by the addition of 20 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40, and centrifuged (10,000 × g, 30 s, 4 °C) to obtain the cytosolic supernatant, which was used for luciferase assays (Promega) measured with a luminometer. Cytosolic lysates were prepared from baculovirus-infected Sf-9 cells for protein-binding assays as described previously (52Zhang Y. Turkson J. Carter-Su C. Smithgall T. Levitzki A. Kraker A.

Briefly, cultured dishes of Sf-9 cells were washed twice with ice-cold 1× PBS and then PBS containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Cells were then lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mmEDTA, 0.1 μm aprotinin, 1 μm leupeptin, and 1 μm antipain) on ice for 10 min and centrifuged (13,000 × g, 30 s, 4 °C) to obtain lysate. Nuclear extract preparations from normal NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (treated with or without IL-6 for 30 min) or from their Src-transformed counterparts and electrophoretic mobility shift assay were carried out as described previously (23Turkson J.

When peptide inhibitors were present, these were preincubated with the nuclear extract for 30 min at room temperature prior to incubation with radiolabeled probe. The Stat3-derived phosphopeptide, PY*LKTK, and non-phosphorylated PYLKTK were individually coupled to agarose beads at the C terminus to generate the bead-coupled peptides, PY*LKTK <> bead or PYLKTK <> bead. Prior to use, bead-coupled peptides were washed 5 times with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Following this, equivalent amounts of each of the bead-coupled peptides were incubated with recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf-9 cell lysates containing equal amounts of Stat1 or Stat3 protein at 4 °C for 30 min. Mixtures were then incubated with or without free peptide, PYLKTK or PY*LKTK, at room temperature for an additional 30 min. Mixtures were washed 5 times with 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer followed by centrifugation (13,000 ×g, 10 s, 4 °C) to remove unbound Stat1 or Stat3 protein and free peptide and obtain bead pellet. SDS sample buffer was then added to the pellet of peptide coupled to bead with bound STAT proteins, boiled, and then subjected to SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Electrophoresed proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Probing of nitrocellulose membranes with primary antibodies and detection of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were performed as described previously (47Yu C.L.

The antibodies used were mouse monoclonal against amino acid residues 613–739 of Stat1 and rabbit polyclonal against the C terminus of Stat3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Colony formation assays were carried out in 6-well dishes as described previously (49Turkson J. Bowman T. Adnane J. Zhang Y. Djeu J.Y. Sekharam M. Frank D.A. Holzman L.B. Wu J. Sebti S. Jove R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7519-7528Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In brief, each well contained 1.5 ml of 1% agarose in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as the bottom layer and 1.5 ml of 0.5% agarose in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4000 or 6000 NIH 3T3/v-Src or NIH 3T3/v-Ras fibroblasts, respectively, as the top layer. Treatment with peptides was initiated 1 day after seeding cells by adding 75–100 μl of medium with or without peptide, and repeated every 3 days, until large colonies were evident. Colonies were quantified by staining with 20 μl of 1 mg/ml iodonitrotetrazolium violet, incubating at 37 °C overnight, and counting the next day. The phosphopeptide, PY*LKTK (where Y* represents phospho-Tyr, Tyr(P)), is derived from the sequence of amino acids in the vicinity of Tyr(P) in the SH2-binding region of Stat3. The Tyr(P) contained in the PY*LKTK sequence of one STAT monomer interacts with the SH2 domain of another STAT monomer to form stable dimers that can bind DNA. The prediction is that PY*LKTK peptide will bind to Stat3 by way of the same Tyr(P)-SH2 interaction and disrupt dimerization and DNA binding activity, which can be measured by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). To test this prediction, nuclear extracts of equal total protein containing activated Stat3 were incubated with or without different concentrations of peptides, PY*LKTK, PYLKTK, or PFLKTK, prior to incubation with 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe, hSIE, for EMSA. The presence of PY*LKTK results in a dose-dependent decrease in the level of Stat3 binding to the hSIE probe (Fig. 1 A), with 50% reduction at peptide concentration of 235 μm. In contrast, preincubation with non-phosphorylated PYLKTK or PFLKTK has no effect on Stat3 DNA binding activity, up to concentrations of 1 mm (Fig. 1, A and B, and data not shown). Together, these results show that PY*LKTK phosphopeptide disrupts Stat3 activity in vitro. Furthermore, the results also demonstrate that the Tyr(P) residue of PY*LKTK is necessary for the observable reduction in Stat3 DNA binding activity. This finding is in agreement with previously reported data that the Tyr(P)-containing peptide of Stat1, GY*IKTE, disrupts Stat1 (44Shuai K. Horvath C.M. Huang L.H. Qureshi S.A. Cowburn D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 821-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2050681211,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT), a novel and promising cancer treatment that employs a combination of a photosensitizing chemical and visible light, induces apoptosis in human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells. However, the precise mechanism of PDT-induced apoptosis is not well characterized. To dissect the pathways of PDT-induced apoptosis, we investigated the involvement of mitochondrial damage by examining a second generation photosensitizer, the silicon phthalocyanine 4 (Pc 4). By using laser-scanning confocal microscopy, we found that Pc 4 localized to cytosolic membranes primarily, but not exclusively, in mitochondria. Formation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) was detected within minutes when cells were exposed to Pc 4 and 670–675 nm light. This was followed by mitochondrial inner membrane permeabilization, depolarization and swelling, cytochrome c release, and apoptotic death. Desferrioxamine prevented mitochondrial ROS production and the events thereafter. Cyclosporin A plus trifluoperazine, blockers of the mitochondrial permeability transition, inhibited mitochondrial inner membrane permeabilization and depolarization without affecting mitochondrial ROS generation. These data indicate that the mitochondrial ROS are critical in initiating mitochondrial inner membrane permeabilization, which leads to mitochondrial swelling, cytochrome c release to the cytosol, and apoptotic death during PDT with Pc 4."
https://openalex.org/W2062019088,"Late Pleistocene changes in oceanic primary productivity along the equator in the Indian and Pacific oceans are revealed by quantitative changes in nanoplankton communities preserved in nine deep-sea cores. We show that variations in equatorial productivity are primarily caused by glacial-interglacial variability and by precession-controlled changes in the east-west thermocline slope of the Indo-Pacific. The precession-controlled variations in productivity are linked to processes similar to the Southern Oscillation phenomenon, and they precede changes in the oxygen isotopic ratio, which indicates that they are not the result of ice sheet fluctuations. The 30,000-year spectral peak in the tropical Indo-Pacific Ocean productivity records is also present in the Antarctica atmospheric CO2 record, suggesting an important role for equatorial biological productivity in modifying atmospheric CO2."
https://openalex.org/W1972417329,"The transthyretin (TTR) amyloid diseases, representative of numerous misfolding disorders, are of considerable interest because there are mutations that cause or suppress disease. The Val30 --> Met30 (V30M) TTR mutation is the most prevalent cause of familial amyloid polyneuropathy in heterozygotes, whereas a Thr119 --> Met119 (T119M) mutation on the second TTR allele protects V30M carriers from disease. Here, we show that the incorporation of one or more T119M TTR subunits into a predominantly V30M tetramer strongly stabilized the mixed tetramer against dissociation. Dissociation is required for amyloid formation, so these findings provide a molecular explanation for intragenic trans-suppression of amyloidosis. The data also suggest a potential therapeutic strategy, provide insight into tissue-specific deposition and amyloid composition, and support the validity of the amyloid hypothesis in human disease."
https://openalex.org/W2170880977,"Telomeres are specialized nucleoprotein structures that stabilize the ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes. In mammalian cells, abrogation of telomeric repeat binding factor TRF2 or DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) activity causes end-to-end chromosomal fusion, thus establishing an essential role for these proteins in telomere function. Here we show that TRF2-mediated end-capping occurs after telomere replication. The postreplicative requirement for TRF2 and DNA-PKcs, the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK, is confined to only half of the telomeres, namely, those that were produced by leading-strand DNA synthesis. These results demonstrate a crucial difference in postreplicative processing of telomeres that is linked to their mode of replication."
https://openalex.org/W2058233545,"Although breeding success is known to increase with group size in several cooperative mammals, the mechanisms underlying these relationships are uncertain. We show that in wild groups of cooperative meerkats, Suricata suricatta, reductions in the ratio of helpers to pups depress the daily weight gain and growth of pups and the daily weight gain of helpers. Increases in the daily weight gain of pups are associated with heavier weights at independence and at 1 year of age, as well as with improved foraging success as juveniles and higher survival rates through the first year of life. These results suggest that the effects of helpers on the fitness of pups extend beyond weaning and that helpers may gain direct as well as indirect benefits by feeding pups."
https://openalex.org/W1971840849,"Synapses in the central nervous system are usually defined by presynaptic exocytotic release sites and postsynaptic differentiations. We report here a demonstration of dendrodendritic inhibition that does not engage a conventional synapse. Using amperometric and patch-clamp recordings in rat brain slices of the substantia nigra, we found that blockade of the dopamine transporter abolished the dendritic release of dopamine and the resulting self-inhibition. These findings demonstrate that dendrodendritic autoinhibition entails the carrier-mediated release of dopamine rather than conventional exocytosis. This suggests that some widely used antidepressants that inhibit the dopamine transporter may benefit patients in the early stages of Parkinson's disease."

The mediating steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) is synthesized as a 37-kDa (p37) precursor that is phosphorylated by protein kinase A and cleaved within the mitochondria to generate 30-kDa forms (p30, pp30). The effectiveness of modified recombinant StAR forms in COS-1 cells without mitochondrial import has led to a prevailing view that cholesterol transport is mediated by p37 StAR via activity on the outer mitochondrial membrane. The present study of the activation of cholesterol metabolism by bromo-cAMP in adrenal cells in relation to35S-StAR turnover indicates that targeting of pp30 to the inner membrane provides the dominant cholesterol transport mechanism. We show that 1) only newly synthesized StAR is functional, 2) phosphorylation and processing of p37 to pp30 occurs rapidly and stoichiometrically, 3) both steps are necessary for optimum transport, and 4) newly synthesized pp30 exhibits very high activity (400 molecules of cholesterol/StAR/min). Segregation of cAMP activation and synthesis of StAR from cholesterol metabolism showed that very low levels of newly synthesized StAR (1 fmol/min/106 cells) sustained activated cholesterol metabolism (0.4 pmol/min/106 cells,t 1/2 = 70 min) long after complete removal of p37 (t 1/2 = 5 min).

Parker K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11540-11545Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The effect of these deletions establishes that StAR is necessary for 80–90% of adrenal cholesterol metabolism. StAR is selectively expressed in all steroidogenic tissues, except the placenta (25Clark B.J. Soo S.C. Caron K.M. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Stocco D.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1346-1355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The latter may express another StAR family member, such as has been cloned from mammary cells (26Watari H. Arakane F. Moog-Lutz C.

A. 1997; 94: 8462-8467Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar).Before the cloning of StAR, co-translational phosphorylation of the precursor protein (p37), followed by rapid intramitochondrial turnover was suggested as a reason for the rapid effect of protein synthesis inhibitors (11Krueger R.J.

Chem. 1991; 266: 19739-19745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfer of the positively charged leader sequence through the import pore requires a mitochondrial membrane potential and is linked to a matrix proteolytic cleavage of the leader sequence (27Pfanner N.

This is consistent with the predominance of a p37 form of StAR (13Epstein L.F. Orme-Johnson N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19739-19745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or retention of intermediate forms, which occur when CCCP, a powerful respiratory uncoupler, prevents entry into the matrix (30Stocco D.M. Sodeman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19731-19738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of cholesterol metabolism by o-phenanthroline (o-phen), an inhibitor of mitochondrial proteolysis, and by CCCP (13Epstein L.F. Orme-Johnson N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19739-19745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Stocco D.M. Sodeman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19731-19738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that this cleavage of StAR is necessary for cholesterol transfer. In isolated mitochondria, cholesterol metabolism, mediated by recombinant StAR, is blocked by CCCP and by inhibition of ATP turnover, each consistent with a need for StAR processing (31King S.R. Liu Z. Soh J. Eimerl S. Orly J. Stocco D.M. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 69: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, the activity of StAR without the targeting sequence in COS-1 cells has led to a broad acceptance that StAR functions on the outer membrane and is than removed from the active site by intramitochondrial transfer (20Arakane F. Sugawara T. Nishino H. Liu Z. Holt J.A. Pain D. Stocco D.M. Miller W.L. Strauss Jr., J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13731-13736Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 30Stocco D.M. Sodeman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19731-19738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In a previous study (32Ariyoshi N. Kim Y-C. Artemenko I. Bhattacharyya K. Jefcoate C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7610-7619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), we showed that ACTH maximally stimulated steroid synthesis in rats in vivo within 10 min, without any measurable change in multiple forms of total StAR. In this paper, we address the question of whether mitochondrial processing is, indeed, essential for activated adrenal cholesterol metabolism, despite the evident possibility of extramitochondrial StAR activity. Here, we resolve why changes in cholesterol metabolism appear to occur without measurable changes in the multiple forms of immunodetectable StAR. We show that these paradoxes are explained by the dependence of activity exclusively on newly synthesized StAR and by the need for extraordinarily little intramitochondrial StAR for maximum activity. The basis for differences between these adrenal studies and experiments with recombinant StAR are discussed.DISCUSSIONRecent experiments using recombinant StAR have led to the concept that StAR acts primarily on the outer membrane of the adrenal mitochondria and that processing is merely involved in the clearance of StAR (20Arakane F. Sugawara T. Nishino H. Liu Z. Holt J.A. Pain D. Stocco D.M. Miller W.L. Strauss Jr., J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13731-13736Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The work presented here shows that, despite this extramitochondrial capability, hormonal stimulation of cholesterol metabolism in adrenal cells requires intramitochondrial processing of the 37-kDa StAR precursor and that targeting of the mature phosphorylated form, pp30, to the inner mitochondria provides a highly efficient cholesterol transfer mechanism. This mechanism allows activation of cholesterol transfer with remarkably little StAR (10 fmol/106 cells of new StAR after 10 min), which functions with high activity (over 400 molecules of cholesterol/StAR/min).We also show here, that newly synthesized and processed pp30 StAR is essential for this cholesterol transfer process, whereas even substantial amounts of mitochondrial StAR formed prior to stimulation are inactive. Full activation and inhibition of cholesterol metabolism in adrenal cells, both in vitro and in vivo, occurred without detectable changes in immunodetectable StAR forms, even when their levels were substantial (Ref. 32Ariyoshi N. Kim Y-C. Artemenko I. Bhattacharyya K. Jefcoate C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7610-7619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar; Figs. 1 and 2). By contrast, the time course for activation of the cholesterol metabolism and the effects of inhibitors of StAR synthesis each indicate a close correlation between the rate of cholesterol metabolism and the amount of newly synthesized pp30, as measured by 35S labeling of StAR immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3). Thus, the long established effectiveness of protein synthesis inhibitors in blocking cholesterol metabolism (as in Fig. 1) could be attributed to this requirement for new synthesis. Similarly, the parallel inhibitory effects ofo-phen and CCCP on pregnenolone synthesis and p30 formation indicate a requirement for processing of this newly synthesized StAR. Nevertheless, activation of cholesterol metabolism in Y-1 cells becomes independent of these processing inhibitors within 15 min (Fig.9 D) when sufficient pp30 has formed to sustain cholesterol transfer (Fig. 3). This eventual resistance too-phen and CCCP and the insensitivity of metabolism of 20α-hydroxycholesterol to these inhibitors (Fig. 5) each confirm that both the membrane disposition of cholesterol and direct turnover of P450scc are completely unaffected by these processing inhibitors.The major observable effect of Br-cAMP on StAR function within the activation period is on the extent of phosphorylation of StAR rather than subsequent steps. However, clearly other steps mediating mitochondrial cholesterol transfer may be affected. Br-cAMP activates phosphorylation of the majority of p30 StAR in adrenal cells (Fig. 2) but has little impact on the initial translation or processing rates during the 10–15 min needed for the attainment of maximum cholesterol metabolism (Fig. 3). The analysis of newly formed (35S-labeled) and preexisting immunodetectable p30 StAR forms indicates that similar phosphorylated forms exist in both pools (Figs. 1 and 2). There was no evidence for a rapidly generated labile p30 StAR form that might account for the rapid changes in cholesterol metabolism. Indeed, total StAR appears to decline somewhat during the initial 15 min after the addition of Br-cAMP. The StAR contribution to cholesterol transfer must, therefore, come from the very small amount of phosphorylated p30 (pp30) that is generated within this 5–10-min activation period that is insufficient to cause a measurable increase relative to the initial nonfunctional levels. Maximum rates of cholesterol metabolism are reached before any of the substantial rise in StAR mRNA and new protein synthesis. Other factors apparently prevent further increases in the rate of cholesterol metabolism during the subsequent 10-fold elevation of StAR expression (Fig. 4).The relative rates of formation and turnover of immunoprecipitated35S-StAR forms show that the rapid attainment of a steady state level of p37 (Fig. 3) is due to nearly quantitative conversion to p30 forms with a t 1/2 of about 5 min (Fig. 8). The time required to achieve a maximum rate of metabolism is close to the time necessary to achieve a steady state of newly synthesized p37 (5–10 min), which is mostly phosphorylated based on the predominance of the pp30 cleavage products (Fig. 2). During this early period of generation of pp30 from pp37, cholesterol metabolism is much more sensitive to o-phen and CCCP than CHX (Fig. 10). The insensitivity to these inhibitors 10 min after cAMP stimulation (Fig.9 D) indicates that even the very little pp30 formed at this time is sufficient to sustain cholesterol transfer. This steady state level for p37, therefore, corresponds to a maximum rate of formation of pp30. Surprisingly, there is relatively little accumulation of p37 StAR when processing is inhibited (Figs. 3, 8, and 9), although this represents by far the predominant turnover route. Possibly, this steady state level of p37 is close to the capacity of the uptake receptor and import channel (40Lithgow T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Any further accumulation would then lead to increased proteolysis of p37 by cytosolic proteases.The absence of changes in any of the multiple immunodetectable forms of p30 StAR during 20–30-min exposures to inhibitors of their formation (CHX and o-phen) (Figs. 1 and 2) indicates that these forms turn over relatively slowly both in vivo andin vitro (t 1/2 >1 h). Paradoxically, in Y-1 cells, Br-cAMP initially stimulates removal of some of the preexisting StAR even while increasing new synthesis (Fig. 4). These opposing processes may contribute to the difficulties in measuring early cAMP-induced increases in total StAR.We have used a novel two-step assay to show that in adrenal cells Br-cAMP stimulates the synthesis of protein mediators that then sustain near maximum levels of cholesterol metabolism without further synthesis (Fig. 6). The characteristics of this two-step mediation of cholesterol metabolism correspond to the formation of p37 StAR as a precursor that then generates pp30 as the active agent. Thus, Br-cAMP rapidly generates optimal amounts of this protein mediator within 5–10 min that then maintains cholesterol metabolism without further need for this stimulus, protein synthesis, or processing. Thus, phase 2 cholesterol metabolism becomes completely insensitive to CHX,o-phen, and CCCP. This is consistent with the involvement of highly active newly synthesized intramitochondrial pp30. In this way, we have separated formation of a measurable amount of new StAR (10 fmol/106 cells at the end of phase 1) from the capacity to move cholesterol to P450scc at an increased rate (0.4 pmol/min/106 cells in phase 2).Although processing inhibitors (o-phen or CCCP) inhibit activation of cholesterol metabolism, we demonstrate a restoration of a similarly sustainable cholesterol metabolism after the removal of these inhibitors by washing. This restoration of cholesterol metabolism increases to the extent that p37 and partially processed forms (p35 and p32) are subsequently converted to p30 and is fully inhibited by both processing inhibitors. CCCP is effective in blocking this restoration despite allowing conversion of p37 to p35 and p32 intermediate forms (Fig. 9). This effectiveness of CCCP establishes that p35 and p32, which are probably partially transferred into the intermembrane space, are also ineffective in mediating cholesterol transfer. StAR processing is equally important to cholesterol metabolism in testis MA-10 cells. Exactly the same sensitivity too-phen and CCCP is seen during 30 min of cAMP stimulation of MA-10 cells, and phase 2 activity is, again, sustained in the absence of continued stimulation. 2I. P. Artemenko, unpublished results.However, the inclusion of o-phen in phase 1 completely prevented phase 2 activity in MA-10 cells. This failure of the cAMP/o-phen combination to generate phase 2 activity in MA-10 cells paralleled a much lower accumulation of p37. This is consistent with a need for p37 to sustain phase 2 activity after the removal of o-phen. This difference is remarkable, considering that phase 2 activity after o-phen inhibition was invariably seen in Y-1 cells of widely differing activities and also in primary adrenal cells. Degradation of p37 appears to be a more effective reaction in MA-10 cells.Fig. 8 C illustrates the much slower decline in cholesterol metabolism in Y-1 cells after the removal of Br-cAMP (t 1/2 ∼7.5 min) compared with the rapid loss of p37 (t 1/2 ∼5 min). This is also consistent with pp30 rather than p37 as the direct mediator. However, pp30 is probably only active with respect to intermembrane transfer while inserted in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This newly formed pp30 should then become ineffective when translocated to the matrix vesicles, which provide the major location for StAR (42King S.R. Ronen-Furman T. Timberg R. Clark B., J. Orly J. Stocco D.M. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5165-5176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The much more rapid inactivation of cholesterol metabolism, in vivo (Fig.1) and in adrenal cell suspensions (9Garren L.D. Gill G.N. Masui H. Walton G.M. Rec. Prog. Horm. Res. 1971; 27: 433-478PubMed Google Scholar, 10Crivello J.F. Jefcoate C.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 542: 315-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), following inhibition of protein synthesis, may result from this matrix relocation. We suggest that a more rapid matrix translocation of pp30 is necessitated by the higher cholesterol flux in the more active normal adrenal cells. The matrix vesicles also contain much of the P450scc, thus raising the possibility that StAR may play an additional role in maintaining the accessibility of cholesterol for metabolism at this location.Fig. 11 summarizes the several steps involved in the processing of p37, including the sites of action of the processing inhibitors. This representation is fully consistent with the mechanism proposed by Orme-Johnson and co-workers (13Epstein L.F. Orme-Johnson N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19739-19745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Pon L.A. Epstein L.F. Orme-Johnson N.R. Endocr.

Biol. 1999; 69: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 54King S.R. Walsh L.P. Stocco D.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 166: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) has further defined this mechanism by showing that a mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP turnover are essential for StAR activity, whereas a proton gradient is not essential. This is, again, fully consistent with the generation of pp30 within the inner mitochondria as the requirement for activity.Factors other than StAR clearly play a major role in limiting these cellular steroidogenesis rates. Thus, the maximum rate of cholesterol metabolism is achieved in primary and Y-1 adrenal cells prior to a 10-fold rise in mRNA and protein translation. 3D. Zhao, unpublished observations. We have previously shown that rates of pregnenolone formation in stimulated bovine adrenal cells are determined by the rate of cholesterol movement to the mitochondria (36Jefcoate C.R. DiBartolomeis M. Williams C.A. McNamara B.C. J. Steroid Biochem. 1987; 27: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Differences in lipoprotein uptake, lysosomal processing, ester hydrolysis, and outer membrane uptake may limit transfer of cholesterol to the mitochondria (44Watari H. Blanchette-Mackie E.J.

Recently, in cytosol of stimulated adrenals, phosphoprotein p43 was identified to act as an intermediary in the stimulation of steroid synthesis through arachidonic acid release and has been found to be a member of the acyl-CoA thioesterase family (45Finkielstein C. Maloberti P. Mendez C.F. Paz C. Cornejo Maciel F. Cymeryng C. Neuman I. Dada I. Mele P.G. Solano A. Podesta E.J. Eur. J.

Res. 2000; 26: 653-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The function of StAR is also likely augmented by the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, which associates in the adrenal mitochondrial outer membrane with porins after ligand activation. This complex organizes a pool of cholesterol that may be essential for subsequent StAR-mediated transfer (47Papadopoulos V. Amri H. Li H. Boujrad N. Vidic B. Garnier M. J. Biol.

In this report, we provide evidence for DOX-induced increase in eNOS transcription and protein expression in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC).

Recently, DOX was shown to undergo reductive activation at the reductase domain of the enzyme, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) (9Vásquez-Vivar J. Martasek P. Hogg N. Masters B.S.S. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Kalyanaraman B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11293-11297Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Endothelial NOS catalyzed an NADPH-dependent superoxide formation from DOX even in its fully coupled state, i.e. in the presence of Ca2+/calmodulin, tetrahydrobiopterin, andl-arginine. DOX caused a dose-dependent inhibition of eNOS activity (9Vásquez-Vivar J. Martasek P. Hogg N. Masters B.S.S. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Kalyanaraman B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11293-11297Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The cardiovascular toxicity of DOX was attributed to a switch in the enzymatic activity of eNOS from a nitric oxide generation enzyme (i.e. eNOS activity) to a superoxide-generating enzyme (i.e. NADPH oxidase activity) (9Vásquez-Vivar J. Martasek P. Hogg N. Masters B.S.S. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Kalyanaraman B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11293-11297Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that myocardial impairment caused by DOX may involve myocyte apoptosis (i.e. programmed cell death) (10Sawyer D.B. Fukazawa R. Arstall M.A. Kelly R.A. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar,11Kotamraju S. Konorev E.A. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33585-33592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). DOX caused endothelial and myocyte apoptosis at submicromolar concentrations (10Sawyer D.B. Fukazawa R. Arstall M.A. Kelly R.A. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 11Kotamraju S. Konorev E.A. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33585-33592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). DOX-induced apoptosis was shown to be linked to intracellular hydrogen peroxide formation (11Kotamraju S. Konorev E.A. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33585-33592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Although inhibitors of eNOS (e.g. l-NAME andl-thiocitrulline) did not affect DOX-induced apoptosis (11Kotamraju S. Konorev E.A. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33585-33592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), the role of eNOS in DOX-mediated apoptosis remains unclear. A recent report indicates that exposure of endothelial cells to hydrogen peroxide promotes eNOS expression (12Drummond G.R. Cai H. Davis M.E. Ramasamy S. Harrison D.G. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Recent studies also suggest that stimulation of endothelial cells with calcium-mobilizing agents activates eNOS by dissociating the membrane-bound eNOS from caveolin (13Goetz R.M. Thatte H.S. Prabhakar P. Cho M.R. Michel T. Golan D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2788-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Because DOX-induced toxicity is mediated by intracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as well as the calcium influx, we surmised that eNOS may play a role in DOX-induced apoptosis. In this study, we report that DOX treatment causes an increase in eNOS transcription and protein activity in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) and that pretreatment with antisense eNOS mRNA causes a decrease in DOX-induced apoptosis. Results also indicate that DOX-induced Ca2+ release and H2O2generation are responsible for activation of apoptosis. Agents (PBN, ebselen, metalloporphyrins, and BAPTA-AM) (see Fig. 1 below) that inhibit mitochondrial H2O2 formation decreased DOX-induced apoptosis. We propose a novel mechanism (see Scheme FS1) for the involvement of the reductase domain of eNOS in stimulating DOX-mediated apoptosis.Figure FS1A schematic representation showing the role of eNOS in DOX-induced apoptosis. RED, OX, and Ca 2+ /CAM denote the reductase and oxygenase domains of endothelial NOS (eNOS) and the calcium/calmodulin complex, respectively. H2O2is shown to up-regulate the expression of eNOS, which drives the redox-cycling of DOX.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) α-Phenyl-tert-butyl nitrone (PBN), 2-phenyl-1,2-benzisoselenazol-3(2H)-one (ebselen), 3,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), Fura 2-AM, and free Fura 2 were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. PBN was also obtained from the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation Spin Trap Source as a gift from Dr. Ronald P. Mason (NIEHS, National Institutes of Health, Research Triangle Park, NC). 5-tert-Butoxycarbonyl-5-methyl-1-pyrrolineN-oxide (BMPO) was synthesized according to a published procedure (14Zhao H. Joseph J. Zhang H. Karoui H. Kalyanaraman B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). 1,2-Bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N“-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA-AM), dihydroethidium/hydroethidine, and 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCF-DA) were purchased from Molecular Probes Inc. and diethylenetriamine NONOate (DNN) and spermine NONOate were from Cayman Chemical Co. Fe(III)tetrakis(4-benzoic acid) porphyrin (FeTBAP) was synthesized according to a published method (15Day B.J. Shawen S. Liochev S.I. Crapo J.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 275: 1227-1232PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies were purchased from the following sources: eNOS antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), Bcl-2 and Hsp70 antibodies (PharMingen, San Diego, CA), cytochrome P450 reductase antibody (Stressgen), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Pierce), and HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The oligonucleotides were received from Operon Technologies Inc. Superoxide dismutase was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Putrescine-modified catalase was a gift from Dr. Joseph F. Poduslo, Mayo Clinic and Foundation, Rochester, MN. BAEC were obtained from the American Type Cell Collection. Cells were obtained at the third passage, transferred to 75-cm2 filter vent flasks (Costar, Cambridge, MA), and grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), insulin (10 μg/ml), transferrin (5 μg/ml), glutamine (4 mmol/l), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml), incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Cells were passaged as described by Balla et al. (16Balla G.H. Jacob H.S. Eaton J.W. Belcher J.D. Vercelotti G.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1991; 111: 1700-1711Crossref Scopus (387) Google Scholar) and used between 6 and 13 passages. Unless otherwise mentioned, 80–90% confluent BAEC were employed for all the experiments. Cells were preincubated separately for 1 h with 100 μm PBN, 50 μm ebselen, 10 μm FeTBAP, 5 μm BAPTA-AM, and later 0.5 μm DOX (final concentration) was added and incubated overnight. For calcium uptake experiments, cells were preincubated with 10 μm Fura 2-AM for 45 min before the addition of DOX. Total RNA from BAEC was extracted using TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc.). Four micrograms of RNA was reverse-transcribed using a first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) employing random hexamers. One-fourth of the cDNA obtained was used to amplify the 357-bp fragment of eNOS, 246-bp fragment of iNOS, and 112-bp fragment 18 S rRNA by polymerase chain reaction using PCR Supermix (Life Technologies). The primers used to amplify the eNOS and iNOS genes were designed according to the published protocol (17Shi Y. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Holman P. Rafiee P. Griffith O.W. Kalyanaraman B. Baker J.E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 695-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Primers for 18 S rRNA were designed employing the Genetics Computer Group, Inc. (GCG) software. The PCR products were resolved on 1% agarose gel, and the bands were quantified by densitometry. Following treatment of BAEC with DOX in the presence and absence of antioxidants, cells were gently scraped, washed in Dulbecco's PBS, and lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% deoxycholic acid, 1 mm Pefabloc, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin). The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and 20 μg from the supernatant was resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE. At the termination of electrophoresis, proteins were transferred overnight at 30 V onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad), and Western blotting was performed using either primary mouse monoclonal antibodies for eNOS (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) or primary rabbit polyclonal antibodies for cytochrome P450 reductase (Stressgen) or primary mouse monoclonal antibody for Hsp70 (Transduction Laboratories) or primary hamster monoclonal antibodies for Bcl-2 (Transduction Laboratories) and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Pierce/Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots were developed using ECL Plus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak) for 3–5 s except cytochrome P450 reductase, which was exposed for 45 s. The resulting bands were quantified by densitometry using an Alpha Innotech gel documentation system. Antisense oligonucleotides for eNOS mRNA were designed to bind the start codon and four subsequent codons to inhibit the translation. The sequence of the antisense and sense oligomers were 5′-CTTCAAGTTGCCCAT-3′ and 5′-ATGGGCAACTTGAAG-3′. Oligonucleotides were introduced into the cells using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 3 h, cells were treated overnight with a fresh medium containing DOX in the presence and absence of antioxidants and other agents to determine eNOS expression and caspase-3 activity. Caspase-3 activity was measured using an ApoAlert caspase-3 colorimetric assay kit (CLONTECH), and the values obtained were normalized to the protein concentration. Nitrite and nitrate, the metabolites of ⋅NO generated were measured by chemiluminescence using the Sievers apparatus following reduction with vanadium(III) chloride (18Pritchard Jr., K.A. Ackerman A.W. Gross E.R. Stepp D.W. Shi Y. Fontana J.T. Baker J.E. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17621-17624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Briefly, BAEC were treated with antiapoptotic antioxidants and DOX for 16 h, and cells were washed three times with DPBS after aspirating the medium. To this, 1 ml of Hanks' balanced salt mixture containing 25 μml-arginine was added and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The medium was collected and centrifuged for 5 min at 5000 rpm, and 50 μl of the clear supernatant was used for nitrate and nitrite analysis. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate. BAEC were pretreated for 1 h with 25, 50, and 100 μm concentration of DNN, incubated with DOX for 16 h. Caspase-3 activity was measured as described in an earlier publication (11Kotamraju S. Konorev E.A. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33585-33592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). BAEC were initially loaded with 10 μm Fura 2-AM for 45 min, and later cells were trypsinized and washed three times with DPBS. Cells were suspended in Hanks' buffer at 106 cells/ml and incubated at 37 °C with gentle stirring in thermostatted cell holder in a Shimadzu spectrofluorometer. DOX was added at a final concentration of 0.5 μm, and fluorescence changes were continuously monitored at 340/510 and 380/510 nm. The ratio of excitation at 340/380 nm with emission at 510 nm was considered as an index of specific calcium uptake (19Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Calcium uptake experiments were carried out using free Fura-2 (Sigma). Briefly, cells were pretreated for 1 h with antioxidants and nitrone spin traps and later incubated with 0.5 μm DOX for 3 h. At the termination of incubation, cells were washed four times with DPBS (without calcium) and lysed by five cycles of freeze thawing. Following centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, the fluorescence of clear supernatants was measured using 5 μm Fura-2. Values are represented as the ratio of excitation wavelengths at 340 and 380 nm with an emission wavelength of 510 nm. The determination of intracellular oxidant production was based on the oxidation of 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein (H2DCF) to a fluorescent 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) (20Konorev E.A. Kennedy M.C. Kalyanaraman B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 368: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 21Ubezio P. Civoli F. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1994; 4: 509-516Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Following treatment of BAEC with DOX and antiapoptotic antioxidants, the medium was aspirated and cells were washed twice with DPBS and incubated in 1 ml of medium without fetal bovine serum (FBS). H2DCF was added at a final concentration of 10 μm and incubated for 20 min. The cells were then washed once with DPBS and maintained in a 1-ml culture medium. The fluorescence was monitored after 30 min using a Nikon fluorescence microscope equipped with a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter. The average intensity values were calculated using the Metamorph software. The redox-sensitive fluorophore hydroethidine (dihydroethidium) has been used to monitor the intracellular oxidative stress (22Benov L. Sztejnberg L. Fridovich I. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 826-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Following pretreatment of BAEC with antiapoptotic antioxidants and then DOX, culture medium was aspirated, and cells were washed once with DPBS and incubated in fresh culture medium without FBS. Hydroethidine (10 μm) was added to the cells, and after a 30-min incubation period during which hydroethidine was oxidized to the fluorophore ethidium, fluorescence images were obtained using a Nikon fluorescence microscope equipped with a rhodamine filter. The fluorescence intensity values from three different fields of view were calculated using the Metamorph software, and the average values are represented. Cellular toxicity was measured by the addition of one-tenth volume of 0.5% MTT dye to cells after treatment with DOX in the presence and absence of antioxidants. MTT-treated cultures were then incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. MTT formazon crystals formed by the cells were solubilized by the addition of 200 μl of 0.1n HCl in isopropanol, and the absorbance was measured at 570 nm in a spectrophotometer, as described earlier (23Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46264) Google Scholar). The protein content was determined according to the method of Lowry et al. (24Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the bovine serum albumin as a standard. BAEC were incubated with DOX (2 μm) for 10–12 h, and, after terminating the experiment, BMPO (25 mm final concentration) was added to the cells and incubated for an additional 15 min. Cells were then gently scraped into 1 ml of the medium and aspirated directly into a Brucker Aquax liquid sample cell of the Brucker EMX EPR spectrometer operating at 9.8 GHz. Typical spectrometer parameters were: scan range, 100 G; field set, 3500 G; time constant, 5 ms; scan time, 5.14 s; modulation amplitude, 1.0 G; modulation frequency, 100 KHz, and microwave power, 10 milliwatts. DOX (0.5 μm) induced a 50–60% increase in eNOS mRNA levels in BAEC (Figs. 1and 2 A). After pretreatment of cells with a nitrone spin trap, PBN (100 μm) reduced DOX-induced eNOS mRNA message levels by 80%. Ebselen, a glutathione peroxidase mimetic, inhibited the message levels to a similar extent. The metalloporphyrin antioxidant mimic, FeTBAP (10 μm), also inhibited DOX-induced eNOS mRNA. No detectable alterations of inducible NOS mRNA levels in DOX-treated BAEC were observed (Fig. 2 A). Following treatment of BAEC with 0.5 μm DOX, a 2-fold increase in the expression of eNOS protein was detected by Western blotting analysis. Pretreatment of cells with PBN (100 μm), ebselen (50 μm), and FeTBAP (10 μm) for 1 h markedly inhibited DOX-induced eNOS protein expression. Under similar treatment conditions, DOX did not have any effect on the induction of P450 reductase protein either alone or in combination with antioxidants (Fig. 2 B). These results suggest a possible role for eNOS in DOX-mediated apoptosis. These results also indicate that intracellularly generated oxidants (e.g. H2O2) may be responsible for eNOS activation (Scheme FS1). The addition of superoxide dismutase (500 units/ml) did not have an appreciable effect on caspase-3 activation, suggesting that extracellular superoxide anion was not responsible for DOX-induced apoptosis. However, addition of cell-permeable putres-cine-modified catalase (500 units/ml) inhibited DOX-induced caspase-3 activity (data not shown). To investigate the specific role of eNOS in DOX-induced toxicity, we used the antisense mRNA designed for eNOS that will bind to the start codon and four subsequent codons of eNOS mRNA. Treatment of BAEC with 10 μm antisense mRNA greatly reduced (approximately 2-fold) eNOS protein levels following a 12-h treatment (Fig. 3 A). Furthermore, BAEC treated with a 10 μm antisense eNOS mRNA showed a 50% reduction in caspase-3 activity as compared with DOX-treated cells (Fig. 3 B). These findings suggest a causal association of eNOS in DOX-induced apoptosis. DOX-induced apoptosis was markedly decreased in thermally preconditioned cells, which was attributed to the induction of Hsp70 levels (25Ito H. Shimojo T. Fujisaki H. Tamamori M. Ishiyama S. Adachi S. Abe S. Marumo F. Hiroe M. Life Sci. 1999; 64: 755-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested whether Hsp70 plays a role in DOX-mediated apoptosis. DOX treatment did not appreciably affect the endogenous levels of Hsp70 (Fig. 3 C). However, pretreatment of cells with PBN (100 μm), ebselen (50 μm), and FeTBAP (10 μm) followed by DOX (0.5 μm) consistently resulted in a 2- to 3-fold induction of Hsp70 (Fig. 3 C). It appears that the induction of Hsp70 in BAEC may be responsible for mitigating DOX-mediated apoptosis. Recent evidence suggests that Hsp70 could inhibit apoptosis by complexing with apaf-1 and prevent the formation of apoptosome (26Beere H.M. Wolf B.B. Cain K. Mosser D.D. Mahboubi A. Kuwana T. Tailor P. Morimoto R.I. Cohen G.M. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 469-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar, 27Saleh A. Srinivasula S.M. Balkir L. Robbins P.D. Alnemri E.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Pretreatment with antioxidants (i.e. PBN, FeTBAP, or ebselen) restored the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 levels in cells (Fig. 3 D). Several lines of evidence suggest that calcium induces eNOS expression (28Lin S. Fagan K.A. Li K.X. Shaul P.W. Cooper D.M. Rodman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17979-17985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 29Xiao Z. Zhang Z. Ranjan V. Diamond S.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 171: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and previous reports indicate that DOX induces intracellular calcium levels in cells (30Kusuoka H. Futaki S. Koretsune Y. Kitabatake A. Suga H. Kamada T. Inoue M. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1991; 18: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 31Aoyama M. Grabowski D.R. Dubyak G.R. Constantinou A.I. Rybicki L.A. Bukowski R.M. Ganapathi M.K. Hickson I.D. Ganapathi R. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thus, we explored the relationship between calcium influx and eNOS expression in DOX-induced apoptosis. Fig. 4 shows that DOX induces a cellular influx of calcium as a function of time. The intracellular concentration was measured to be nearly 2-fold greater in BAEC exposed to 0.5 μm DOX (Fig. 4 A). The calcium levels remained elevated even up to 3 h after incubation with DOX. None of the antiapoptotic antioxidants (PBN, ebselen, and FeTBAP) antagonized DOX-induced calcium influx (Fig. 4 B), indicating that these antioxidants affect processes that are downstream of eNOS expression. Treatment with BAPTA-AM blocked the expression of eNOS (Fig. 2). These findings suggest that DOX-induced apoptosis is probably mediated via an influx of calcium and that this increase in intracellular calcium levels in turn causes enhanced transcription of eNOS. Pretreatment of BAEC with BAPTA-AM (5 μm) decreased DOX-induced apoptosis by 2- to 3-fold (Fig. 4 C). This protection was also observed in MTT cytotoxicity assay (not shown). Cells treated with 0.5 μm DOX induced a cell death of ∼40%; however, pretreatment with 5 μmBAPTA-AM completely abrogated DOX-mediated cell apoptosis. Τo investigate whether DOX induces oxidative stress in BAEC, we employed the dichlorofluorescein staining technique for monitoring the intracellular oxidant production. This assay is based on the oxidation of H2DCF by intracellular peroxide and other oxidants to a fluorescent compound, DCF. Results indicate that there is nearly a 2- to 3-fold increase in the intensity of DCF staining in BAEC treated with 0.5 μmDOX. However, pretreatment of the cells with antiapoptotic antioxidants and BAPTA-AM significantly decreased the fluorescence as compared with cells treated with DOX alone (Fig. 5). Because H2DCF could exacerbate the extent of oxidative stress through self-generated H2O2 (32Rota C. Chignell C.F. Mason R.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 873-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 33Rota C. Fann Y.C. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28161-28168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), we used another fluorescent probe, hydroethidium, that has been used to detect intracellular superoxide formation (22Benov L. Sztejnberg L. Fridovich I. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 826-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). We used this probe, because the hydroethidium-derived radical does not artifactually generate superoxide and hydrogen peroxide (22Benov L. Sztejnberg L. Fridovich I. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 826-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 shows the intracellular red fluorescence due to the intercalation of ethidium into DNA. As shown in Fig. 6, DOX-induced enhancement in ethidium fluorescence was inhibited by the antiapoptotic antioxidants, antisense eNOS, but not by sense eNOS. Comparison of the oxidative stress data (Figs. 5 and 6) with changes in eNOS mRNA shown in Fig. 2 indicates that DOX-induced transcription of eNOS closely parallels the endothelial oxidative stress induced by DOX.Figure 6The effect of antioxidants and antisense/sense eNOS on DOX-induced oxidative stress as measured by hydroethidium fluorescence. BAEC were treated with DOX, antioxidants, and antisense and sense eNOS as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Following an overnight incubation or after 8 h, the medium was aspirated, and cells were washed twice with DPBS and incubated with 20 μm hydroethidium for 15 min.

Similar to the ubiquitin conjugation system, SUMO/Smt3 is transferred to substrate lysine residues through the thioester cascade of E1 (activating enzyme) and E2 (conjugating enzyme). In our previous report (Takahashi, Y., Toh-e, A., and Kikuchi, Y. (2001) Gene 275, 223–231), we showed that Siz1/Ull1 (YDR409w) of budding yeast, a member of the human PIAS family containing a RING-like domain, is a strong candidate for SUMO1/Smt3 ligase because the SUMO1/Smt3 modification of septin components was abolished in the ull1 mutant and Ull1 associated with E2 (Ubc9) and the substrates (septin components) in immunoprecipitation experiments. Here we have developed an in vitro Smt3 conjugation system for a septin component (Cdc3) using purified recombinant proteins. In this system, Ull1 is additionally required as well as E1 (Sua1·Uba2 complex), E2 (Ubc9), and ATP. A cysteine residue of the RING-like domain was essential for the conjugation both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, a region containing the RING-like domain directly interacted with Ubc9 and Cdc3. Thus, this SUMO/Smt3 ligase functions as an adaptor between E2 and the target proteins.

(2001) Gene 275, 223–231), we showed that Siz1/Ull1 (YDR409w) of budding yeast, a member of the human PIAS family containing a RING-like domain, is a strong candidate for SUMO1/Smt3 ligase because the SUMO1/Smt3 modification of septin components was abolished in the ull1 mutant and Ull1 associated with E2 (Ubc9) and the substrates (septin components) in immunoprecipitation experiments. Here we have developed an in vitro Smt3 conjugation system for a septin component (Cdc3) using purified recombinant proteins. In this system, Ull1 is additionally required as well as E1 (Sua1·Uba2 complex), E2 (Ubc9), and ATP. A cysteine residue of the RING-like domain was essential for the conjugation both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, a region containing the RING-like domain directly interacted with Ubc9 and Cdc3. Thus, this SUMO/Smt3 ligase functions as an adaptor between E2 and the target proteins. small ubiquitin-like modifier dithiothreitol green fluorescent protein glutathione S-transferase hemagglutinin protein inhibitor of activated STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) suppressor ofmif2 ubiquitin-like protein ligase 1 activating enzyme conjugating enzyme protein ligase phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride Gal4 activation domain SUMO1(small ubiquitin-likemodifier)/Smt3 is a member of a growing family of ubiquitin-related proteins and is known to be conjugated to RanGAP1, PML (promyelocytic leukemia), IκBα, p53, septins, etc. (1Müller S.

In the ubiquitin pathway a third enzyme, ubiquitin ligase (E3), is often required for the final transfer of this modifier and plays a crucial role by recognizing target proteins and by promoting their conjugation (10Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6793) Google Scholar). It remains unknown, however, whether any SUMO1/Smt3 ligases (E3s) are involved in this conjugation pathway.In the ubiquitin pathway, some E3 components such as Apc11 of the anaphase-promoting complex and Rbx1 of the SCF (Skp1, cullin, F-box protein)·ubiquitin ligase complex contain a zinc-binding RING domain with an octet of ordered cysteine and histidine residues forming a cross-brace around two zinc atoms (11Saurin A.J.

This type of ubiquitin ligases (E3s) has to interact with E2 and the substrate at the same time because apparently they do not form the thioester bond with ubiquitin. In the case of c-Cbl proto-oncoprotein, its RING domain interacts with UbcH7 (E2), and the tyrosine kinase binding domain, a region close to the RING domain, recognizes its substrate. Thus, c-Cbl proto-oncoprotein functions as a bridging molecule between E2 and its substrate (13Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar).In budding yeast, Smt3 is the only member of the SUMO family, and the Smt3 conjugation system is essential for mitotic growth. The lethality of the smt3 deletion mutant can be suppressed by expressing human SUMO1, suggesting that SUMO1 is a functional homologue of yeast Smt3 (14Takahashi Y. Iwase M. Konishi M. Tanaka M. Toh-e A. Kikuchi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). As the substrate proteins in yeast, three components of septins (Cdc3, Cdc11, and Shs1) have been identified so far (14Takahashi Y. Iwase M. Konishi M. Tanaka M. Toh-e A. Kikuchi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 15Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Septins are a highly conserved group of GTP-binding proteins from yeast to human and are required for the completion of cytokinesis, polar growth, and morphogenesis checkpoint control (16Longtine M.S.

Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 387-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar).In our previous work, we showed that Siz1 (YDR409w), a member of a new family including human PIAS3 (18Chung C.D. Liao J. Liu B. Rao X. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K. Science. 1997; 278: 1803-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar), containing a RING-like domain, is required for the Smt3 conjugation to septins in vivo and associates with Ubc9 and septins as assayed by immunoprecipitation experiments (19Takahashi Y. Toh-e A. Kikuchi Y. Gene. 2001; 275: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thereby, Siz1 could be a novel Smt3/SUMO1 ligase. In this report, we have developed an in vitro Smt3 conjugation system and demonstrate that Siz1 is a bona fide SUMO1/Smt3 ligase. Thus we propose the gene name of YDR409w as ULL1(ubiquitin-like protein ligase). Furthermore, we show that a region containing the RING-like domain directly interacts with Ubc9 and Cdc3.DISCUSSIONIn our previous study, we showed that the SUMO1/Smt3 conjugation to Cdc3 depends on Ull1 in vivo and that Ull1 interacts with E2 and the substrates in immunoprecipitation analysis (19Takahashi Y. Toh-e A. Kikuchi Y. Gene. 2001; 275: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have developed an in vitro system where Ull1 is required for the Smt3 modification of Cdc3 in addition to E1 and E2 enzymes (Fig. 2). These results exclude a possibility that the absence of septin sumoylation in the ull1 mutant is due to a defect in expression of hypothetical factors in the Smt3 conjugation pathway in the mutant. Although it has been published that E3 is not required in the SUMO1/Smt3 conjugation pathway (24Okuma T. Honda R. Ichikawa G. Tsumagari N. Yasuda H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), we suspect that it may be an in vitro artifact because only E1 and E2 enzymes promoted the modification in our system when a large amount of E2 was added to the reaction. 2Y. Takahashi, T. Kahyo, A. Toh-e, H. Yasuda, and Y. Kikuchi, unpublished results. Human SUMO1 rescues the lethality of the yeastsmt3 deletion mutant (14Takahashi Y. Iwase M. Konishi M. Tanaka M. Toh-e A. Kikuchi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and both SUMO1 and mouse Ubc9 interacted with yeast Ull1 in the two-hybrid system (Fig.3A). Furthermore, human E1 and E2 enzymes successfully promoted the in vitro yeast Smt3 conjugation to the septin component (Fig. 2). These results indicate that enzymes in the SUMO1/Smt3 conjugation pathway are well conserved from yeast to human.Certain ubiquitin ligases are known to carry a zinc-binding RING-finger domain that often interacts with ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. In accordance with these facts, Ull1 as a SUMO1/Smt3 ligase contains a RING-like domain, and the conserved cysteine residues in the domain are important for the Smt3-protein conjugation in vivo (Ref. 19Takahashi Y. Toh-e A. Kikuchi Y. Gene. 2001; 275: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholarand Fig. 1) and in vitro (Fig. 2). It is not known, however, whether the structure of this RING-like domain is similar to the authentic RING-finger domain of a bracelet structure containing two zinc atoms. This issue remains to be elucidated.The region containing the RING-like domain (from amino acids 327 to 465) of Ull1 interacted with Ubc9 in the two-hybrid system (Fig.3B) and in vitro binding assay (Fig.3C). On the other hand, the Ull1C377S mutant protein did not interact with Ubc9 in the two-hybrid system (Fig.3B). Also, this domain directly interacted with Cdc3 (Fig.3C). Among ubiquitin ligases, only the HECT proteins are known to bind a ubiquitin molecule through thioester bond formation. The other ubiquitin ligases have to interact with E2 and the substrate at the same time because those ubiquitin ligases apparently do not form the thioester bond with ubiquitin and function as bridging molecules between E2 and the substrates. In the case of c-Cbl proto-oncoprotein, the RING domain interacts with UbcH7 (E2), and the region (tyrosine kinase binding domain) close to the RING domain is known to be a recognition site for its substrate (13Zheng N.

Just like this c-Cbl proto-oncoprotein, the region containing the RING-like domain of Ull1 binds to Ubc9 (E2) and Cdc3 (substrate) (Fig. 3). Taken together, Ull1 should be qualified as an E3 (SUMO1/Smt3 ligase) in the SUMO1/Smt3 conjugation pathway, and enzymes both in the SUMO1/Smt3 and ubiquitin conjugation pathways are conserved.

X-ray microanalysis of the electron-dense vacuoles or polyphosphate bodies of C. reinhardtii showed large amounts of phosphorus, magnesium, calcium, and zinc. Immunofluorescence microscopy, using antisera raised against a peptide sequence of the vacuolar type proton pyrophosphatase (H+-PPase) of Arabidopsis thaliana which is conserved in the C. reinhardtii enzyme, indicated localization in the plasma membrane, in intracellular vacuoles, and the contractile vacuole where it colocalized with the vacuolar proton ATPase (V-H+-ATPase). Purification of the electron-dense vacuoles using iodixanol density gradients indicated a preferential localization of the H+-PPase and the V-H+-ATPase activities in addition to high concentrations of PPi and short and long chain polyphosphate, but lack of markers for mitochondria and chloroplasts. In isolated electron-dense vacuoles, PPi-driven proton translocation was stimulated by potassium ions and inhibited by the PPi analog aminomethylenediphosphonate. Potassium fluoride, imidodiphosphate,N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, andN-ethylmaleimide also inhibited PPi hydrolysis in the isolated organelles in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that the electron-dense vacuoles of C. reinhardtii are very similar to acidocalcisomes with regard to their chemical composition and the presence of proton pumps.

In isolated electron-dense vacuoles, PPi-driven proton translocation was stimulated by potassium ions and inhibited by the PPi analog aminomethylenediphosphonate. Potassium fluoride, imidodiphosphate,N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, andN-ethylmaleimide also inhibited PPi hydrolysis in the isolated organelles in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that the electron-dense vacuoles of C. reinhardtii are very similar to acidocalcisomes with regard to their chemical composition and the presence of proton pumps. Polyphosphate was also localized to the contractile vacuole by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining, suggesting, with the immunochemical data, a link between these organelles and the acidocalcisomes. pyrophosphate proton pyrophosphatase vacuolar proton ATPase phosphate-buffered saline aminomethylenediphosphonate 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide Intracellular granules of microorganisms that stain with basic dyes have been referred to as volutin or metachromatic granules (1Meyer A. Bot. Zeit. 1904; 62: 113-152Google Scholar). It is generally agreed that volutin granules contain polyphosphate, a linear polymer of many tens or hundreds of orthophosphate (Pi) residues linked by high energy phosphoanhydride bonds (2Wiame J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1947; 1: 234-255Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 3Kornberg A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). This conclusion initially derived from the correlation of the polyphosphate content of yeast cells with the number and size of the volutin granules (2Wiame J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1947; 1: 234-255Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The presence of volutin granules or polyphosphate bodies has been described in bacteria, algae, yeast, and protozoa (3Kornberg A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). In algae, polyphosphate bodies are characterized by their high electron density when observed by electron microscopy (4Harold F.M. Bacteriol. Rev. 1966; 30: 772-794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent isolation of these electron-dense bodies from the cell wall-deficient biflagellate green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii allowed the demonstration of the presence of pyrophosphate (PPi)1 and polyphosphate, as measured by 31P NMR, and phosphorus, magnesium, and calcium, as detected by x-ray microanalysis (5Komine Y. Eggink L.L. Park H. Hoober J.K. Planta. 2000; 210: 897-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In recent years electron-dense vacuoles similar to the polyphosphate bodies and containing high concentrations of PPi, polyphosphate, calcium, magnesium, and other elements have been found in trypanosomatids and apicomplexan parasites and named acidocalcisomes (6Docampo R. Moreno S.N.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 33: 151-159Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In addition, these organelles were shown to contain proton and calcium pumps and several exchangers in their limiting membrane (6Docampo R. Moreno S.N.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 33: 151-159Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The presence of such transporters has not been investigated in the polyphosphate bodies of other microorganisms, and it is not known whether they represent the same organelle. One of the pumps present in acidocalcisomes is the vacuolar type H+-translocating pyrophosphatase (H+-PPase). H+-PPases have also been described in plants, algae, and bacteria (7Drozdowicz Y.M. Rea P.A. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 206-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 8Maeshima M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). A potassium-stimulated pyrophosphatase activity was detected by measurement of PPi hydrolysis in microsomal fractions of C. reinhardtii (9Robinson D.G. Hoppenrath M. Oberbeck K. Ratajczak R. Bot. Acta. 1998; 111: 108-122Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Because a protein of similar molecular weight to a plant H+-PPase was recognized by polyclonal antibodies raised against the enzyme from the tonoplast of mung bean hypocotyl, the presence of an H+-PPase was postulated (9Robinson D.G. Hoppenrath M. Oberbeck K. Ratajczak R. Bot. Acta. 1998; 111: 108-122Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This protein was localized in the plasma membrane, contractile vacuole, and unidentified “intermediate size vesicles” (9Robinson D.G. Hoppenrath M. Oberbeck K. Ratajczak R. Bot. Acta. 1998; 111: 108-122Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that acidocalcisomes and polyphosphate bodies are representatives of the same organelle we investigated whether the morphologically and chemically well characterized polyphosphate bodies of C. reinhardtii also possessed enzymatic activities in their limiting membranes. We report the isolation of these polyphosphate bodies, which were identified by their elemental and polyphosphate content. The organelles were shown to possess vacuolar proton ATPase (V-H+-ATPase) and H+-PPase activities. The H+-PPase was shown to possess similar characteristics to the plant, bacterial, and acidocalcisomal H+-PPase. An unexpected finding was the colocalization of these proton pumps, as well as polyphosphate, in the contractile vacuoles, suggesting a link between these two cellular organelles. Our results imply that the phylogenetic distribution of acidocalcisomes is much wider than proposed previously. C. reinhardtii cell wall(−) wild type strain, isolated after ARG7 insertional mutagenesis of the parental strain CC425 (10Niyogi K.K. Björkman O. Grossman A.R. Plant Cell. 1977; 4: 1369-1380Google Scholar), was provided by Dr. K. Niyogi (University of California, Berkeley). Cells were grown photoheterotrophically in Tris acetate phosphate (TAP) medium (11Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Source Book: A Comprehensive Guide to Biology and Laboratory Use. Academic Press, San Diego1988: 25-31Google Scholar) with agitation. The temperature was maintained at 25 °C, and the light intensity was 100 μmol of photons/m2 × s−1, provided by 40-W cool white fluorescent lamps. Cells were harvested at the late exponential growth phase. ATP, Dulbecco's PBS, digitonin, and reagents for marker enzyme assays were purchased from Sigma. Silicon carbide (400 mesh) was bought from Aldrich. Iodixanol (40% solution (OptiPrep, Nycomed)) was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Monoclonal antibody N-2 against the 110-kDa accessory protein of the Dictyostelium discoideum V-H+-ATPase (12Fok A.K. Clarke L.M. Allen R.D. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was purchased from the Monoclonal Antibody Center of the University of Hawaii. Polyclonal antibodies raised against a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated synthetic peptide corresponding to the hydrophilic loop XII (antibody PABHK or 326) of plant H+-PPase (13Zhen R.-G. Kim E.J. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22340-22348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and aminomethylenediphosphonate (AMDP) (14Zhen R.G. Baykov A.A. Bakuleva N.P. Rea P.A. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Prof. Philip Rea, University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia). Molecular weight markers and Coomassie Blue protein assay reagent were from Bio-Rad. The EnzChek phosphate assay kit was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR).Escherichia coli strain CA38 pTrcPPX1 was kindly provided by Prof. Arthur Kornberg, Stanford University School of Medicine (Stanford, CA). All other reagents were of analytical grade. 45Ca2+ release was measured as described previously (5Komine Y. Eggink L.L. Park H. Hoober J.K. Planta. 2000; 210: 897-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cells (1 × 107) were washed twice with Dulbecco's PBS and incubated in 1 ml of 1 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2,0.1 mm K2HPO4, 0.1 mmCaCl2, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2 (buffer C), with 0.1 mCi/ml of 45CaCl2 for 3 h. After washing the cells twice by centrifugation with PBS, they were suspended in 3 ml of buffer C plus 20 mm EGTA, and 20 μm digitonin was added. These permeabilized cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 5 μm nigericin or 20 mm NH4Cl at 37 °C for different periods of time. Aliquots were taken and filtered through Whatman GT glass microfiber filters and washed three times with 3 ml of ice-cold 1 mm EGTA in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, and the radioactivity of the filters was measured by scintillation counting. Cells were collected by centrifugation and washed twice in Dulbecco's PBS and once in lysis buffer (125 mm sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 20 mm K-Hepes, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm pepstatin, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino) butane, and 10 μmNα-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, pH 7.2). The cell pellet was mixed with 1.5 × wet weight silicon carbide and lysed by grinding with a pestle and mortar for at least 4 min. Lysis was monitored by optical microscopy. The lysate was clarified first by centrifugation at 144 × g for 5 min then at 325 × g for 10 min. The second pellet was washed under the same conditions, and the supernatant fractions were combined and centrifuged for 30 min at 10,500 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 4 ml of lysis buffer with the aid of a 22-gauge needle and applied to a discontinuous gradient of iodixanol, with 4-ml steps of 24, 28, 34, 37, and 40% iodixanol, diluted in lysis buffer (15Scott D.A. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24215-24221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The gradient was centrifuged at 50,000 ×g in a Beckman SW28 rotor for 60 min. The electron-dense vacuole fraction pelleted on the bottom of the tube and was resuspended in lysis buffer. Gradient fractions were assayed as described previously for cytochrome c oxidase (16Kreuzberg K. Köck G. Grobheiser D. Physiol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 26114-26121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The construction of normalized density distribution histograms was carried out as described before (22Leighton F. Poole B. Beaufay H. Baudhin P. Coffey J.W. Fowler S. De Duve C. J. Cell Biol. 1968; 37: 482-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Cells (1 × 107–1 × 108) were washed once with Dulbecco's PBS and treated to extract either long chain or short chain polyphosphate. Different samples were used in each case. Long chain polyphosphate extraction was performed as described by Ault-Riché et al. (21Ault-Riché D. Fraley C.D. Tzeng C.-M. Kornberg A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1841-1847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For PPi and short chain polyphosphate extraction, the cell pellet was resuspended in ice-cold 0.5 m HClO4(2 ml/g of wet weight of cells). After 30 min of incubation on ice, the extracts were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 s. The supernatants were neutralized by the addition of 0.72 mKOH and 0.6 m KHCO3. Precipitated KClO4 was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g for 30 s, and the extracted supernatant was used for polyphosphate and PPi determination. Polyphosphate levels were determined from the amount of Pi released upon treatment with an excess of purified recombinant exopolyphophatase fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae as described previously (20Ruiz F.A. Rodrigues C.O. Docampo R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26114-26121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). PPi levels were determined from the amount of Pi released upon treatment with inorganic pyrophosphatase (Sigma, final activity 10 units/ml) as described previously (20Ruiz F.A. Rodrigues C.O. Docampo R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26114-26121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Pyrophosphatase was assayed by measuring released phosphate using the EnzChek phosphate assay as described before (15Scott D.A. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24215-24221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar,23Scott D.A. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Zhong L. Lu H.-G. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. J. Biol.

Reaction mixtures contained 130 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 2 mm MgSO4, 50 μm EGTA, 0.1 mm2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleoside, 0.4 unit/ml purine nucleoside phosphorylase, 0.2–0.4 mg of electron-dense vacuole fraction, and PPi as indicated in a total volume of 0.1 ml. Activity was recorded at 360 nm and 30 °C in a PowerWave 340i plate reader (Bio-tek Instruments, Minnoski, VT). PPi-driven H+ uptake into electron-dense vacuoles was assayed using acridine orange as described before (23Scott D.A. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Zhong L. Lu H.-G. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22151-22158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), except that the standard buffer used was 120 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 50 mm K-Hepes, 50 μm EGTA, pH 7.2. 15-μl aliquots of theChlamydomonas subcellular fractions were mixed with 15 μl of electrophoresis buffer (125 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7, 10% (w/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 4% (w/v) bromphenol blue) and boiled for 5 min prior to application to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Electrophoresed proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose using a Bio-Rad transblot apparatus. Membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat dry milk in PBS and kept overnight at 4 °C. A 1:10,000 dilution of antiserum 326 against H+-PPase in blocking buffer was applied to blots at room temperature for 60 min. The nitrocellulose was washed three times for 20 min each with PBS (containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20), before the addition of a 1:20,000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG in blocking buffer for 30 min. Immunoblots were visualized on radiographic film (Kodak) using the ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining, cells (5 × 107) obtained as described above were washed twice with Dulbecco's PBS and fixed for 30 min with 2% glutaraldehyde in Dulbecco's PBS. The cells were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 1 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of Dulbecco's PBS. 45 μl of this suspension was incubated at room temperature with 10 μg of DAPI and 40 μm digitonin. After 10 min, the samples were mounted on a slide and observed with an Olympus laser scanning confocal microscope using optical sections of 0.1 μm and an argon laser for detection of polyphosphate (20Ruiz F.A. Rodrigues C.O. Docampo R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26114-26121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence experiments cells fixed with 4% formaldehyde (freshly prepared) were allowed to adhere to poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 and 3% albumin for 5 min, and prepared for immunofluorescence with a 1:100 dilution of antibody PABHK(326) or a 1:100 dilution of the monoclonal antibody N-2 and a rhodamine-coupled goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) or fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:150), respectively. Control preparations were incubated with preimmune serum or without the primary antibody. Immunofluorescence images were obtained with the laser scanning confocal microscope using krypton and argon lasers for detection of the fluorescent dyes. For imaging whole cells and electron-dense vacuole fractions the preparations were washed in 0.25 m sucrose, and a 5-μl sample was placed on a Formvar-coated 200-mesh copper grid, allowed to adhere for 10 min at room temperature, blotted dry, and observed directly with a Hitachi 600 transmission electron microscope operating at 100 kV (15Scott D.A. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24215-24221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 23Scott D.A. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Zhong L. Lu H.-G. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22151-22158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Energy-dispersive x-ray analysis was done at the Electron Microscopy Center, Southern Illinois University (Carbondale, IL). Specimen grids were examined in a Hitachi H-7100FA transmission electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 50 kV. Fine probe sizes were adjusted to cover the electron-dense vacuoles (or a similar area of the background), and x-rays were collected for 100 s by utilizing a thin window (Norvar) detector. Analysis was performed by using a Noran Voyager III analyzer with a standardless analysis identification program. The acidocalcisome has been defined as a calcium-containing acidic compartment (6Docampo R. Moreno S.N.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 33: 151-159Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Ca2+ was present in an acidic compartment of C. reinhardtii, we loaded the cells with 45Ca2+, permeabilized them with digitonin, and measured the release of Ca2+ in the presence or absence of agents known to alkalinize acidic compartments, such as the K+/H+ ionophore nigericin and the weak base NH4Cl (6Docampo R. Moreno S.N.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 33: 151-159Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Addition of these compounds resulted in release of more than 60% of the incorporated 45Ca over a period of 6 min (Fig. 1), whereas a slower45Ca release was observed in the absence of nigericin or NH4Cl. The results suggested the presence of a significant amount of Ca2+ incorporated into an acidic intracellular compartment of C. reinhardtii. Acidocalcisomes are recognized as vacuoles of high electron density when they are observed in transmission electron micrographs of intact cells (6Docampo R. Moreno S.N.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 33: 151-159Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Similar vacuoles of varying sizes and high electron density were seen when whole Chlamydomonascells were observed by transmission electron microscopy without fixation and staining (Fig.2 A). About 30–40 vacuoles were observed in each cell with an average diameter of about 200 nm. X-ray microanalysis was performed on these dense organelles to investigate their elemental composition (Fig. 2 B). The spectra generated showed that they contained phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium. Zinc was present in 3 of 10 spectra obtained. In the representative spectrum shown (Fig. 2 B), peaks for phosphorus were about 3-fold greater than peaks for calcium, which were about 2-fold greater than peaks for magnesium. Peaks for calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and zinc were not present in spectra taken from the background (Fig. 2 C). The copper peaks were generated from the copper grid and were not present when nickel grids were used (not shown). To purify the electron-dense vacuoles of C. reinhardtii and investigate whether they were similar to acidocalcisomes from trypanosomatid parasites we adapted the purification procedure used for the isolation of acidocalcisomes from Trypanosoma cruzi(15Scott D.A. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24215-24221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The utility of the method was assessed by assaying marker enzymes (Fig. 3). Pyrophosphatase, the most conspicuous marker of acidocalcisomes (15Scott D.A. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24215-24221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), was assessed as the PPi hydrolytic activity sensitive to the specific H+-PPase inhibitor AMDP (14Zhen R.G. Baykov A.A. Bakuleva N.P. Rea P.A. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Its yield in fractions 23–24 (the densest fractions, containing the electron-dense vacuoles, see below) was 17%, whereas the yield of protein was only 0.15%, a 113-fold purification. This may actually be a large underestimate of the degree of purification of the electron-dense vacuoles because an H+-PPase was also postulated to be located on the cell surface and contractile vacuole of Chlamydomonas (9Robinson D.G. Hoppenrath M. Oberbeck K. Ratajczak R. Bot. Acta. 1998; 111: 108-122Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Mitochondria (marked by cytochrome c oxidase; Ref. 16Kreuzberg K. Köck G. Grobheiser D. Physiol. Plant. 1987; 69: 481-488Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and chloroplasts (marked by glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; Ref.17Klein U. Chen C. Gibbs M. Platt-Aloia K.A. Plant Physiol. 1983; 72: 481-487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were not enriched in the electron-dense vacuole fractions. The electron-dense vacuole fractions (fractions 23 and 24) contained more than 35% of the total amounts of PPi, and short and long chain polyphosphate, and about 25% of the total bafilomycin A1-sensitive ATPase activity. Taking into account the low protein concentration of these fractions (0.15%) this also represents a more than 100-fold purification of these molecules or activities. The electron-dense vacuole fractions were therefore enriched at least 100-fold more than other cell compartments by this technique. Electron microscopy of fractions 23 and 24, by observation of air-dried samples (Fig. 4 A), had the same appearance as the acidocalcisomal fractions from T. cruzi(23Scott D.A. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Zhong L. Lu H.-G. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22151-22158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). As occurs with the T. cruzi organelles (24Lu H.-G. Zhong L. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2309-2323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), when they were submitted to the electron beam changes in their internal structure led to the appearance of a sponge-like structure (Fig. 4 A,inset). The results of x-ray microanalysis of the organelles (Fig. 4 B) were similar to those of whole cells except that more magnesium and potassium and less calcium and zinc were detected relative to the phosphorus peak, probably because of ionic changes occurring during the fractionation procedure.Figure 4Electron microscopy and x-ray microanalysis of the dense fraction containing PPase activity.

Once a steady state of acridine orange accumulation was reached, the addition of 0.1 mm PPi led to further dye uptake, indicating increasing vesicular acidity. Acridine orange accumulation was inhibited by AMDP (Fig. 5 B, compare trace b withtrace a). 10 μm AMDP released acridine orange when added after acidification had started (Fig. 5, A andB, trace a). The vesicle pH was neutralized, and acridine orange release also occurred after addition of 10 mm NH4Cl (Fig. 5 A). Pyrophosphatase was also assayed in electron-dense vacuole preparations by Pi detection (23Scott D.A. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Zhong L. Lu H.-G. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22151-22158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Control pyrophosphatase activity was 0.54 ± 0.025 μmol of PPi consumed/min/mg of protein (means ± S.E. of results from 12 separate experiments) and was inhibited by 30 μm AMDP by 80 ± 5.3% (average ± S.E. of 10 experiments). The effects of monovalent cations on AMDP-inhibitable PPi hydrolysis are shown in TableI. Replacing 130 mm KCl with 250 mm sucrose in the buffer resulted in lower pyrophosphatase activity that was reduced further by replacement of 130 mm KCl with 130 mm NaCl or 65 mmNaCl, 125 mm sucrose.

The present study was undertaken to investigate the myofibroblast phenotype that appears after activation of normal lung fibroblasts by thrombin. We demonstrate that thrombin induces smooth muscle-α actin expression and rapid collagen gel contraction by normal lung fibroblasts via the proteolytically activated receptor-1 and independent of transforming growth factor-β pathway. Using antisense oligonucleotides we demonstrate that a decreased level of PKCε abolishes SM-α actin expression and collagen gel contraction induced by thrombin in normal lung fibroblasts. Inhibition of PKCε translocation also abolishes thrombin-induced collagen gel contraction, SM-α actin increase, and its organization by normal lung fibroblasts, suggesting that activation of PKCε is required for these effects. In normal lung fibroblasts PKCε binds to SM-α actin after thrombin treatment, but in activated fibroblasts derived from scleroderma lung they associate even in untreated cells. This suggests that SM-α actin may serve as a substrate for PKCε in lung fibroblasts when activated by thrombin. We propose that thrombin differentiates normal lung fibroblasts to a myofibroblast phenotype via a PKC-dependent pathway. Thrombin-induced differentiation of normal lung fibroblasts to a myofibroblast phenotype resembles the phenotype observed in scleroderma lung fibroblasts. Therefore, we conclude that chronic exposure to thrombin after microvascular injury leads to activation of normal lung fibroblasts and to the appearance of a myofibroblast phenotype in vivo.

We have demonstrated that myofibroblasts are present in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of scleroderma (SSc) patients with active lung disease, and that SSc lung myofibroblasts express more collagen I, III, and fibronectin than normal lung fibroblasts (11Ludwicka A.

Recently, we have shown myofibroblasts to be present in the interstitium of lung tissue from scleroderma patients with active pulmonary fibrosis, where a large amount of extracellular matrix is deposited (13Byeon M.K. Harley R.A. Wessels A. Silver R.M. Ludwicka-Bradley A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11 (Abstr. 1723): 332aGoogle Scholar). The factors responsible for the differentiation of normal lung fibroblasts to a myofibroblast phenotype are not well known, although TGF-β has been postulated to participate in such transition (3Hewiston T.D.

Thrombin is well known for its role in hemostasis and thrombosis, and it also induces a wide range of cellular responses associated with both normal and disease processes. Evidence suggests that thrombin is an important mediator of the interstitial lung fibrosis accompanied by microvascular injury associated with SSc (17Ohba T. McDonald J.K. Silver R.M. Strange C.

Recently we have shown that PKCγ is involved in the increased expression of interleukin-8 by lung fibroblasts, while PKCε regulates thrombin-induced tenascin-C expression in lung fibroblasts (18Ludwicka-Bradley A. Tourkina E. Suzuki S. Tyson E. Bonner M. Fentin II, J.W. Hoffman S. Silver R.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 19Tourkina E. Hoffman S. Fenton II, J.W. Lipsitz S. Silver R.M. Ludwicka-Bradley A. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 1370-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that thrombin promotes PKCε expression in normal lung fibroblasts, yet inhibits PKCε expression in SSc cells. Subcellular localization of PKCε is also markedly different in both cell types (19Tourkina E. Hoffman S. Fenton II, J.W. Lipsitz S. Silver R.M. Ludwicka-Bradley A. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 1370-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Therefore, thrombin may trigger distinct PKC signaling in normal and SSc lung fibroblasts, and the differences in signaling may be responsible for some of the different behaviors of these cell types.The present study was undertaken to investigate the role of thrombin in lung fibroblast activation and the signaling pathway(s) by which thrombin affects lung fibroblast behaviors. Upon determining that thrombin induces smooth muscle-α actin and collagen gel contraction, two characteristics of myofibroblasts, we examined the cellular mechanisms mediating differentiation of normal lung fibroblasts to a myofibroblast phenotype. We demonstrate that PKCε regulates the transition of normal lung fibroblasts to myofibroblasts by binding to SM-α actin upon exposure to thrombin. Interestingly, in SSc lung fibroblasts PKCε and SM-α actin are associated even in the untreated state. We also show that another feature of myofibroblasts, their proliferative capacity, is mediated by classical PKC isoforms.DISCUSSIONThe present studies were carried out to characterize the myofibroblast phenotype that occurs after activation of normal lung fibroblasts by thrombin. Phenotypic modifications induced by thrombin such as SM-α actin expression and collagen gel contraction were observed. We demonstrate that PKCε regulates transition of normal lung fibroblasts to myofibroblasts by binding to SM-α actin. Interestingly, in SSc lung fibroblasts PKCε and SM-α actin are associated even in the untreated state. This suggests that SM-α actin may serve as a substrate or anchoring protein for PKCε in lung fibroblasts when activated by thrombin. Using antisense oligonucleotides we demonstrate that decreasing the level of PKCε in normal lung fibroblasts abolishes SM-α actin expression and collagen gel contraction induced by thrombin. We also observed that inhibition of PKCε translocation in normal lung fibroblasts abolishes thrombin-induced collagen gel contraction and SM-α actin induction, suggesting that activation of PKCε is required for both effects. We propose that thrombin differentiates normal lung fibroblasts to a myofibroblast phenotype via PKCε signaling. Moreover, thrombin-induced transition of normal lung fibroblasts to a myofibroblast phenotype resembles the phenotype of SSc lung fibroblasts.The myofibroblast phenotype is present in a variety of fibrotic diseases, including scleroderma. Scleroderma is an autoimmune connective tissue disease characterized by microvascular injury and fibrosis of skin and visceral organs, including the lung (38Steen V.D. Conte C. Owens G.R. Medsger Jr., T.A. Arthritis Rheum. 1994; 37: 1283-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 39Steen V.D. Medsger Jr., T.A. Arthritis. Rheum. 2000; 43: 2437-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Pulmonary fibrosis in scleroderma is a frequent complication and major cause of death; however, the pathogenesis is unclear and no effective therapy exists, The pathology of pulmonary fibrosis in SSc demonstrates features of dysregulated and abnormal repair, fibroproliferation and deposition of various extracellular matrix proteins (38Steen V.D. Conte C. Owens G.R. Medsger Jr., T.A. Arthritis Rheum. 1994; 37: 1283-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar).It is postulated that activated fibroblasts (myofibroblasts) are involved in the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis. Recently, we reported increased numbers of myofibroblasts in lung tissue from SSc in association with high extracellular matrix accumulation (13Byeon M.K. Harley R.A. Wessels A. Silver R.M. Ludwicka-Bradley A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11 (Abstr. 1723): 332aGoogle Scholar). Several studies have demonstrated a correlation between fibrosis and SM-α actin-expressing myofibroblasts (4Zhang K.

The isolated myofibroblasts from various fibrotic tissues, including lungs, are thought to be a primary source of collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins (10Zhang K. Rekhter M.D. Gordon D. Phan S.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 114-125PubMed Google Scholar,11Ludwicka A. Trojanowska M. Smith E.A. Baumann M. Strange C. Korn J. Smith T. LeRoy E.C. Silver R.M. J.

Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 1370-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Although myofibroblasts have been postulated to participate in the development of lung fibrosis, the mechanism of myofibroblast phenotype induction is not well understood.In the present study we investigated thrombin-induced differentiation of normal lung fibroblasts to a myofibroblast phenotype and the signaling pathway that modulates such transition. Previously, we reported a significant increase in thrombin activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from SSc patients (17Ohba T. McDonald J.K. Silver R.M. Strange C. LeRoy E.C. Ludwicka A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1994; 10: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). It has also been observed that procoagulant activity is increased in the lungs of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, especially patients with progressive disease (41Kotani I. Sato A. Hayakawa H. Urano T. Takada K. Takada U. Thromb. Res. 1995; 77: 493-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice (42Tani K.

Thrombin, besides its importance in thrombosis and hemostasis, also has several important functions at a cellular level in the stimulation of platelets, leukocytes, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and lung fibroblasts (15Godin O.

J. 1996; 313: 353-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The multiple effects of thrombin on cells include regulation of proliferation, stimulation and expression of various cytokines, and regulation of several extracellular matrix proteins (19Tourkina E.

Proliferation, contraction, and increased extracellular matrix protein production by myofibroblasts thereby generate forces within the parenchyma, which may be major contributors to the severely impaired lung function observed in SSc and other types of pulmonary fibrosis.We observed that SSc lung fibroblasts express significantly higher amounts of SM-α actin compared with normal lung fibroblasts. We found that thrombin induces SM-α actin in a dose- and time-dependent manner in normal lung fibroblasts, as well as in SSc lung fibroblasts, despite the already high levels of SM-α actin in SSc cells. Treatment of normal lung fibroblasts with thrombin induced SM-α actin to the levels observed in SSc lung fibroblasts. Because thrombin and SM-α actin co-exist in the inflammatory and early fibrotic stages in many pathologic situations, including pulmonary fibrosis (5Zhang H. Gharaee-Kermani M. Zhang K. Karmiol S. Phan S.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 527-537PubMed Google Scholar, 12Ludwicka A. Ohba T. Trojanowska M. Yamakage A. Strange C. Smith E.A. LeRoy E.C. Silver R.M. J.

Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2103) Google Scholar), and because thrombin induces SM-α actin in cultured lung fibroblasts, we sought to determine the mechanism which mediates this interaction(s).The factors regulating SM-α actin expression in fibroblasts in pathologic lungs are still not well known. Factors secreted by alveolar macrophages such as TGF-β1 have been postulated to play such a role (4Zhang K. Phan S.H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 21: 658-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 5Zhang H. Gharaee-Kermani M. Zhang K. Karmiol S. Phan S.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 527-537PubMed Google Scholar, 14Vaugham M.B. Howard E.W. Tomasek J.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 257: 180-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 45Low R.B. Curr. Top. Pathol. 1999; 93: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Since TGF-β1 is known to induce SM-α actin in lung fibroblasts (5Zhang H. Gharaee-Kermani M. Zhang K. Karmiol S. Phan S.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 527-537PubMed Google Scholar), and since thrombin increases TGF-β1 in mesenchymal cells (23Bachhuber B.G. Sarembock I.J. Gimple L.W. Owens G.K. J. Vasc. Res. 1997; 34: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we examined whether thrombin-induced SM-α actin is regulated by TGF-β1. We observed that TGF-β1 increases SM-α actin within 48–72 h, whereas thrombin induces SM-α actin within 12–24 h. Additionally, antibody against TGF-β1 does not inhibit thrombin-induced SM-α actin in lung fibroblasts, suggesting that thrombin acts via a TGF-β1-independent pathway.We observed that lung fibroblasts stimulated with thrombin have the ability to contract collagen gels. When cultured within collagen gel, fibroblasts are able to recognize collagen fibers and contract the gel. This is believed to reflect the in vivo phenomenon of wound contraction and extracellular remodeling in connective tissue. In lung fibrosis it might reflect the pathologic stiffness observed in SSc and other restrictive lung diseases. We demonstrate that thrombin is a potent inducer of rapid fibroblast-populated collagen gel contraction. Contraction is inhibited by two thrombin inhibitors, hirudin and PPACK, suggesting a specific effect of thrombin on collagen gel contraction. We also observed that normal lung fibroblasts when incubated in serum-free medium do not contract collagen gels even after 24 h, whereas SSc lung fibroblast-populated collagen gels contract within 8–24 h. The level of contraction among SSc cells is dependent on the level of SM-α-actin, with more SM-α actin being associated with a higher degree of collagen gel contraction.Proteolytically activated receptor-1, cell types including fibroblasts mediates many of the pathophysiological responses to thrombin (43Grand R.J.A.

Proteolytically activated receptor-1 can couple to the G12/12, Gq, and GI proteins. The α-subunit of G12 and G13 binds Rho guanidine-nucleotide exchange factors, which activate small G-protein RhoA and mediate cytoskeletal reorganization (46Mahajan V.B. Pai K.S. Lau A.

We show that proliferative capacity of SSc lung fibroblasts was increased more then two times when compared with DNA synthesis in normal lung fibroblasts. We also demonstrate that thrombin-induced DNA synthesis in lung fibroblasts is mediated by classical PKC isoforms (α or β). The mitogenic effect of thrombin was more profound in normal lung fibroblasts then in SSc cells, possibly due to desensitization of the thrombin receptor in SSc cells (50Lum M. Andersen T.T.

We have demonstrated that 1 nm ouabain induced transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), resulting in increased proliferation and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) uptake. Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting showed that the EGFR and Src were phosphorylated within 5 min of 10−9m ouabain stimulation. Both ouabain-induced DNA synthesis (BrdUrd uptake) and MAPK42/44 phosphorylation were inhibited by the Src inhibitor PP2, the EGFR kinase inhibitor AG1478, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein, and the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059. Ouabain concentrations higher than 1 nm had little or no stimulating effect on proliferation or BrdUrd uptake but did minimally activate ERK1/2. Thus, low concentrations of ouabain, which do not inhibit the sodium pump sufficiently to perturb the resting cellular ionic milieu, initiate a transactivational signaling cascade leading to vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation.

However, research in this area has recently shown that this protein complex has the potential to function in ways that apparently do not involve these well documented ionic shifts. For example, Peng et al. (1Peng M. Huang L. Xie Z. Huang W.H. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10372-10378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) reported that the sodium pump complex can function as a molecular signal transducer in rat cardiac myocytes. Kometiani et al. (2Kometiani P. Li J. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol.

Recently many growth factor signaling pathways have been shown to involve EGFR transactivation in VSMCs (3Haendeler J. Berk B.C. Regul.

Signals Recept. 1998; 7: 90-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) as was also shown earlier in cardiac myocytes (5Haas M. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27832-27837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In this paper we describe the ability of low concentrations of ouabain (0.1–1.0 nm) to induce proliferation of cultured canine vascular smooth muscle cells via a signaling cascade involving Src, EGFR, and MAPK42/44. The isolation of ouabain-like substances from the plasma and urine samples of both healthy and hypertensive individuals (6Hamlyn J.M. Lu Z.R. Manunta P. Ludens J.H. Kimura K. Shah J.R. Laredo J. Hamilton J.P. Hamilton M.J. Hamilton B.P. Clin. Exp. Hypertens. 1998; 20: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), as well as a variety of animal tissues, has suggested potentially important paradigms for these agents in the modulation of cell function through interaction with the sodium pump. All chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Ouabain (o-3125 and o-5754) from Sigma and ouabain (75640) from Fluka were used. All kinase inhibitors were from Calbiochem. Antibodies for Src, phosphotyrosine (4G10, monoclonal), and EGFR were from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Waltham, MA). The antibody for MAPK42/44 (E10, monoclonal) was from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA). Anti-active EGFR antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Vascular smooth muscle cells were isolated from the saphenous veins of mongrel dogs by a two-step enzymatic digestion procedure as described earlier (7Allen J.C. Navran S.S. Seidel C.L. Dennison D.K. Amann J.M. Jemelka S.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C786-C792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The collected cells were cultured in 10% serum DMEM containing 150 μg/ml penicillin, 150 μg/ml streptomycin, 300 μg/ml neomycin, 250 μg/ml gentamycin, and 0.1 mg/ml meropenem. Upon reaching confluence the cells were passaged twice. The second passage cells were used. All cells were synchronized in serum-free media for 48 h prior to experimentation. The bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) uptake kit from Calbiochem/Oncogene was used. This method uses spectrophotometric absorbance for the detection of BrdUrd incorporated into the DNA, visualized by using anti-BrdUrd antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. For this assay cells were cultured in 96-well plates at a concentration of 2000 cells/well. Cells were grown in serum for 48 h and synchronized for 48 h before the experiment. BrdUrd uptake during 24 h was measured. A mean of six wells was used to determine each data point. Cells were grown in 35-mm dishes in 10% serum DMEM for 1 day, counted, switched to 5% serum DMEM with or without ouabain, and counted after 5 days of culture using a Neubauer hemocytometer. The mean of counts from four plates was used for each data point. Canine VSMCs were grown in 10% serum DMEM in 100-mm dishes to 70% confluence, upon which they were switched to serum-free DMEM for 48 h for quiescence. For the experiments cells were stimulated with 10−9m ouabain in serum-free DMEM for the indicated times. After treatment with ouabain, cells were collected by a rubber scraper on ice by using sample buffer (100 μl/100-mm dish) (62.5 mm Tris, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm ortho-vanadate, pH, 6.8) and briefly (15 s) sonicated on ice. The samples were run on 7.5 or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels in Laemmli buffer, and protein bands were transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore, Bedford, MA) nylon membranes. The gels were transferred for 1 or 5 h for optimum transfer and quantitation of small or large size bands, respectively. Membranes were incubated with either phospho-MAPK antibody (E10, monoclonal), MAPK antibodies (New England Biolabs), phosphotyrosine (4G10) antibody, or EGFR antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) in blocking solution (5% nonfat dry milk in 1× TBST (0.1% Tween 20, 2.5% Tris base, 8% NaCl, pH 7.2)) overnight at 4 °C. The proteins were detected by using goat anti-mouse or goat-anti rabbit secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad) and the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blots probed with phospho antibodies were stripped and reprobed with a non-phospho antibody to assure equal loading. The density of resulting protein bands was analyzed by using Image Tool (University of Texas, San Antonio, TX) or Scion Image (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD) software. Cells were isolated as stated for Western blotting and lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate). 200 μg of protein were precipitated in immunoprecipitation buffer, in a total volume of 1 ml, by using the antibody (5 μg/sample) and protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 2 h to overnight at 4 °C on a rotating platform. The beads were collected by pulse spinning at 10,000 × g. Beads were washed one time in immunoprecipitation buffer and three times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 20 min each. The beads were boiled in 2% SDS sample buffer for 5 min and centrifuged for 1 min at 10,000 × g to collect the immunoprecipitated protein. At this point, the protein was subjected to Western blotting as described above. Uptake of 86Rb+ is used as an indicator of pump function. Cells were cultured to about 70% confluence and synchronized as described above. Before the experiments cells were washed twice with buffer consisting of 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 20 mm HEPES adjusted to pH 7.4. The cells were preincubated in the buffer for 20 min. Cells in treatment groups were incubated for 10 min in 1 nm or 0.1 mm ouabain; following this, rubidium uptake was initiated by addition of 2 μCi of86Rb with or without 1 nm or 0.1 mmouabain. After incubation in 86Rb+ for 10 min, the experiment was terminated by aspiration of the incubation fluid followed by four rapid washes in cold buffer. Cells were trypsinized, and a small aliquot was used to count cell numbers. Reduction in the total uptake was measured for each group and was normalized to the cell number. A duplicate set of samples was run simultaneously to determine ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake or that which is due to the Na+ pump. This is calculated by subtracting the uptake in the presence of ouabain (ouabain-insensitive uptake) from total uptake of 86Rb+. Intracellular Ca2+ was measured by fura-2/AM. Cells were grown in 10% serum DMEM on glass coverslips until they reached 50% confluence. At this point they were made quiescent by incubating in serum-free media. At the time of experiments, cells were washed with PBS twice and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the presence of 10 μm fura-2/AM. At the end of this period cells were washed twice with PBS to get rid of extracellular fura-2 and were further incubated in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. After this, cells were treated with 10−9 or 10−4mouabain or other agents (platelet-derived growth factor and ionomycin), and intracellular calcium was measured by using the InCyt MicroPhotometer Module from Intracellular Imaging Inc. (Cincinnati, OH). The measurements were made from individual cells, and a mean of 16 cells was used. We used one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's honestly significant difference test to analyze the differences within groups and Student's t test to test differences among groups. We investigated the effects of ouabain on VSMC proliferation. The control cells were treated with DMEM with or without 5% serum. Addition of 10−9mouabain increased BrdUrd uptake by 32% both in the presence and absence of serum compared with control over a 24-h period (*,p < 0.001) (Fig.1 a). The effect of 10−10m ouabain was similar but less robust than at the higher concentration. 10−8mouabain showed no proliferation. The cell counts during a 5-day interval showed that both 10−10 and 10−9m ouabain induced an increase in cell number compared with control in the presence of serum alone (*, p < 0.05) (Fig. 1 b). The higher ouabain concentration of 10−8mactually significantly decreased the proliferation rate when compared with the effects of the three lower ouabain concentrations, although there still was an increase in the number of cells when compared with day 1. In samples of VSMCs treated with 10−9m ouabain, tyrosine phosphorylation of many proteins of different sizes was observed by Western blot. The tyrosine phosphorylation was maximal at 5 min (Fig.2 a). In samples transferred for 1 h, the most prominent phosphorylated bands appeared at 130, 85, 70, and 44 kDa. The proteins larger than 140 kDa could be observed only after transferring for 5 h, which affected the visibility of the smaller bands negatively. Thus in these experiments a positive control of EGF-treated cells was used to test for the effect of EGF and show the EGFR phosphorylation in canine VSMCs. In the samples transferred for 5 h, the presence of a 180-kDa band that was also phosphorylated by EGF was observed (Fig. 2 b). These data together suggested that ouabain induced either tyrosine kinase activation or tyrosine phosphatase inhibition while activating the signaling cascade in canine VSMCs. The signaling involved phosphorylation of many proteins, one of which seems to be the EGF receptor. We first tested the possibility that the 44-kDa protein referred to above was MAPK42/44 since MAPK42/44 activation is often induced in proliferating VSMCs (8Takahashi E. Berk B.C. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1998; 164: 611-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Indeed we observed that 10−9m (1 nm) ouabain induces MAPK42/44 activation at both 5 and 15 min in the absence of serum (Fig.3 a) (*, p = 0.001). In addition, there was a small amount of activation observed with 10−8m ouabain as well, but as seen in Fig. 1 there was never any increased proliferation or BrdUrd uptake observed at this concentration of ouabain. This suggests that at higher concentrations other consequences of ouabain-pump interaction,i.e. sufficient pump inhibition to lead to cellular ionic perturbations, may be interfering with the proliferative signaling pathway. MEK inhibitor PD98059 (100 μm), tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (100 μm), the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 (500 nm), and the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 (500 nm) all inhibited both the MAPK42/44 activation (Fig.4 a) (+, p < 0.001) and DNA synthesis (Fig. 4 b) (+, p < 0.002) induced by 10−9m ouabain. DNA synthesis was not inhibited by the protein kinase C inhibitor calphostin (100 μm). We wanted to examine the possibility that sodium pump inhibition per se could be a signal inducer even at these low concentrations of ouabain (0.1–1.0 nm). We used the 86Rb uptake method to assess sodium pump activity during a 15-min 10−9m ouabain treatment. There was no detectable change in86Rb uptake between control and ouabain-treated cells. High concentrations of ouabain inhibited the sodium pump and decreased86Rb uptake as expected (Fig.5 a). We also tested our cells for the effect of a range of low K+ concentrations that would inhibit the sodium pump and thus increase intracellular sodium. Cells were grown in 96-well plates in 10% serum DMEM for 48 h and synchronized in serum-free DMEM for 48 h as usual. At this point the medium was switched to serum-free low K+ DMEM. Control cells were treated with regular serum-free DMEM, and ouabain was administered in regular DMEM as well. BrdUrd uptake of cells treated with 1–4.5 mmK+ (in 0.5 mm increments) did not increase during the 24-h stimulation compared with control. However, 10−9m ouabain induced a 30% increase (*,p < 0.001) (Fig. 5 b). These data imply that the observed signaling is not due to inhibition of sodium pump activity. The importance of calcium signaling for MAPK42/44 activation and proliferation is well documented for VSMCs (9Schmitz G. Hankowitz J. Kovacs E.M. Atherosclerosis. 1991; 88: 109-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 10Lompre A.M. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 1999; 26: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To determine whether this is a part of the ouabain signaling pathway, we measured intracellular calcium by fura-2 during ouabain treatment for 15 min in the absence of serum. 10−9m ouabain did not induce any changes in intracellular calcium levels (Fig.6), which suggested that at least the early steps of the signaling pathway do not involve calcium. In addition, a much higher ouabain concentration had no effect on cytoplasmic Ca2+ as well, consistent with the observation that the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger has only a minimal regulatory role in this cell type (canine VSMCs) (11Kahn A.M. Seidel C.L. Allen J.C. Shelat H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1992; 3: 522Google Scholar). For controls, calcium was increased by both 20 ng of platelet-derived growth factor (12Nakagawa Y. Rivera V. Larner A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8785-8791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 6) and ionomycin (data not shown). In our experiments 10−9m ouabain doubled the EGFR phosphorylation (shown by immunoprecipitations followed by blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies) at 5 min of stimulation (*,p < 0.001). The direct blots with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies also showed a phosphorylated band at ∼180 kDa (Fig.2 b). We verified the 180-kDa band to be EGFR by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting (Fig.7). Both EGF- and ouabain-induced EGFR phosphorylation were blocked by AG1478 tyrphostin treatment, which inhibits the EGFR kinase. The ouabain-induced activation of the EGFR was totally blocked by the Src inhibitor PP2, which suggests a role of Src kinase in ouabain-induced EGFR transactivation. On the other hand, EGF-induced activation of the EGFR was not affected by PP2 (Fig.8 a) (+, p < 0.001). We were also able to show an increase in Src phosphorylation by 5 min of 1 nm ouabain stimulation in canine VSMCs (*,p < 0.05) by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting (Fig. 8 b). These data suggest that Src activation appears to be involved in the EGFR activation in ouabain-induced signaling in VSMC proliferation.Figure 8a, inhibitors of EGFR phosphorylation. Synchronized cells were preincubated with inhibitor alone for 20 min before being stimulated with 1 nm ouabain or 10 ng of EGF in the presence of an inhibitor. Src inhibitor PP2 (500 nm) and EGFR inhibitor AG1478 (500 nm) were used. Experiments were carried out in the absence of serum. PP2 inhibited ouabain-induced EGFR phosphorylation but not EGF-induced activation of the receptor in these cells.

Chem. 2000; 275: 27838-27844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) have shown that 100 μm ouabain can activate hypertrophic pathways in rat cardiomyocytes. The present paper defines the proliferation pathways of canine VSMCs induced by low concentrations of ouabain. We observed at 10−10 and 10−9mthat ouabain induced MAPK42/44 activation, DNA synthesis, and proliferation in VSMCs. The increase in DNA synthesis and proliferation effects disappeared with increased ouabain concentrations, but a small increment in MAPK activation remained. Considering the limited number of pump sites and expression of only one isoform of the sodium pump in these cells (15Aydemir-Koksoy A. Allen J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H1869-H1874Google Scholar), this finding suggests that at higher concentrations the pump-inhibitory effect of ouabain might interfere with its proliferative effect. The concentrations at which we observed a significant increase in BrdUrd uptake, proliferation, and MAPK42/44 activation are ∼100 times lower than the K d for ouabain for these cells (K d = ∼10−7m; Ref. 7Allen J.C. Navran S.S. Seidel C.L. Dennison D.K. Amann J.M. Jemelka S.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C786-C792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus at these low ouabain levels, even if there was pump inhibition (∼1%), the resulting increase in cytoplasmic Na+ would be reduced by the turnover of the remaining functioning, i.e. noninhibited, pumps. Thus we are suggesting that in this tissue, ouabain activates a proliferative pathway in the absence of any cellular ionic perturbation but that this effect will be inhibited by the cytoplasmic ionic changes that occur in the face of increasing pump inhibition. This finding is somewhat different from that reported by a variety of other workers who used a concentration of 100 μm ouabain in rat cardiomyocytes, known for having a K d of 10−4–10−5m for ouabain (1Peng M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 27838-27844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Our data also demonstrated that MAPK42/44 activation is required for ouabain-induced DNA synthesis and proliferation and that this effect was inhibited by PD98059 (MEK inhibitor). The importance of MAPK42/44 activation for ouabain signaling is also supported by the fact that other inhibitors (PP2, AG1478 tyrphostin, and genistein) inhibit DNA synthesis in response to ouabain and also inhibit MAPK42/44 activation. 10−9m ouabain had no effect on86Rb+ uptake, an accepted index of Na+ pump activity. This suggested that even if there may be a small number of pumps inhibited at this low concentration of ouabain such inhibition does not significantly affect intracellular sodium homeostasis and suggests that the signaling is not due to increased intracellular Na+ itself. Certainly higher concentrations of ouabain can increase intracellular sodium and limit proliferation. We have also measured intracellular calcium to further assess the possible effect of 10−9m ouabain and observed no changes, although the cells did respond positively to platelet-derived growth factor (16Dilberto P.A. Gordon G. Herman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12612-12617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our study, the principal pathway that was activated by ouabain was the EGFR pathway. The fact that MAPK42/44 activation did not increase further from what is observed with EGF alone when 10 ng of EGF and 10−9m ouabain were administered together (data not shown) suggested that EGFR transactivation is a step in the molecular cascade induced by ouabain. There is increasing evidence from a number of recent studies suggesting that transactivation of the EGFR by growth factors that use receptor tyrosine kinases as well as G-protein-coupled receptors occurs readily in VSMCs (17Saito Y. Berk B.C. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2001; 33: 3-7Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 18Iwasaki H. Eguchi S. Marumo F. Hirata Y. J. Cardiovasc.

In our study both Src and EGFR were phosphorylated by 1 nmouabain. EGFR phosphorylation was blocked by Src inhibitors in cells stimulated by ouabain but not in those stimulated by EGF, which suggested a role for Src kinase in ouabain-induced EGFR transactivation. The role of EGFR transactivation has been shown for a number of other agents, such as insulin, insulin-like growth factor-I, α2-adrenergic receptor agonists, and angiotensin II (20Berk B.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10 Suppl. 11: S62-S68PubMed Google Scholar, 21Geschwind A. Zwick E. Prenzel N. Leserer M. Ullrich A.

Ball S.G. Balmforth A.J. Cell. Signal. 2000; 13: 269-277Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This is the first time that this pathway has been shown to be involved in ouabain-induced proliferation in VSMCs, although it has been shown to be involved in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (5Haas M. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27832-27837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The fact that low concentrations of K+ (1–4.5 mm), which are known to inhibit the pump at least partially, did not induce the signaling pathways induced by ouabain provides important evidence for a unique signaling mechanism that is not due to pump inhibition but rather receptor-ligand binding (pump-ouabain) in VSMCs. EGFR transactivation seen by ouabain treatment is intriguing because previously EGF has been shown to induce sodium pump expression and thus reduce lung edema in pulmonary epithelial cells (24Danto S.I. Borok Z. Zhang X.L. Lopez M.Z. Patel P. Crandall E.D. Lubman R.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C82-C92Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests a two-way interaction/activation between two signaling systems. The cytoskeletal proteins ankyrin and adducin (25Ferrandi M. Manunta P. Rivera R. Bianchi G. Ferrari P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H1338-H1349PubMed Google Scholar,26Tripodi G. Valtorta F. Torielli L. Chieregatti E. Salardi S. Trusolino L. Menegon A. Ferrari P. Marchisio P.C. Bianchi G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2815-2822Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) and cytoskeleton-related kinases such as focal adhesion kinase are good candidates for mediating the link between a conformational change in the sodium pump to its neighboring proteins in the membrane (27Velarde V. Ullian M.E. Morinelli T.A. Mayfield R.K. Jaffa A.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C253-C261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ouabain-induced signaling is intriguing considering that recently many researchers have isolated a variety of substances commonly termed endogenous digitalis-like factors from plasma or urine of healthy as well as hypertensive individuals (28Kramer, H. J., Meyer-Lehnert, H., Michel, H., and Predel, H. G. (1991) Am. J. Hypertens. 481–489Google Scholar, 29Takahashi H. Hypertens. Res. 2000; 23, Suppl. l: S1-S5Crossref Google Scholar, 30Goto A.

Yoshioka M. Sugimoto T. Pharmacol. Rev. 1992; 44: 377-399PubMed Google Scholar). Similar substances have also been isolated from extracts of heart, hypothalamus, or adrenals of animal subjects (32Laredo J. Hamilton B.P. Hamlyn J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Clearly these data say nothing regarding the possible relationship between these nonionic affects of the glycosides and these endogenous compounds, but it does raise the interesting possibilities that some relationship does exist. In summary the study presented here suggests a potential new role for the sodium pump in signaling, one that links it to growth in VSMCs. The pathways can be activated by low levels of ouabain, which do not impair cytoplasmic ionic homeostasis. When higher concentrations of the drug are used, proliferation is diminished, suggesting two functions of the drug, a proliferative effect occurring at lower concentrations and the better known pump-inhibiting effect that occurs at higher concentrations, which can interfere with the proliferative effect. The data emphasize the potential interaction between signaling pathways in complex systems as well as raise issues regarding the possible regulatory roles of endogenous digitalis-like factors.

Here we addressed its mode of regulation and identified a mechanism that restrains its apoptotic function in growing cells and enables its activation during cell death. It involves autophosphorylation of Ser308within the calmodulin (CaM)-regulatory domain, which occurs at basal state, in the absence of Ca2+/CaM, and is inversely correlated with substrate phosphorylation. This type of phosphorylation takes place in growing cells and is strongly reduced upon their exposure to the apoptotic stimulus of C6-ceramide. The substitution of Ser308 to alanine, which mimics the ceramide-induced dephosphorylation at this site, increases Ca2+/CaM-independent substrate phosphorylation as well as binding and overall sensitivity of the kinase to CaM. At the cellular level, it strongly enhances the death-promoting activity of the kinase. Conversely, mutation to aspartic acid reduces the binding of the protein to CaM and abrogates almost completely the death-promoting function of the protein. These results are consistent with a molecular model in which phosphorylation on Ser308 stabilizes a locked conformation of the CaM-regulatory domain within the catalytic cleft and simultaneously also interferes with CaM binding. We propose that this unique mechanism of auto-inhibition evolved to impose a locking device, which keeps death-associated protein kinase silent in healthy cells and ensures its activation only in response to apoptotic signals.

This microfilament-associated Ca2+/calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM)-dependent kinase has a unique multidomain structure that mediates protein-protein interactions such as ankyrin repeats and the death domain. The death-promoting effects of DAPK depend on its catalytic activity, the correct intracellular localization, and the presence of the death domain (2Cohen O. Feinstein E. Kimchi A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 998-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 3Cohen O. Inbal B. Kissil J.L. Raveh T. Berissi H. Spivak-Kroizaman T. Feinstein E. Kimchi A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the expression of DAPK is frequently lost in cancer cell lines (6Kissil J.L. Feinstein E. Cohen O. Jones P.A. Tsai Y.C. Knowles M.A. Eydmann M.E. Kimchi A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In some of these cell lines, aberrant DNA methylation was responsible for gene silencing. Analysis of the methylation status of DAPK 5′-untranslated region in DNA extracted from primary normal and tumor samples demonstrated frequent hypermethylation in B-cell malignancies (7Katzenellenbogen R.A. Baylin S.B. Herman J.G. Blood. 1999; 93: 4347-4353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), non-small cell lung carcinomas (8Esteller M. Sanchez-Cespedes M. Rosell R. Sidransky D. Baylin S.B. Herman J.G.

Invest. 2000; 80: 1651-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Furthermore, functional studies of experimental metastasis in syngeneic mice established a connection between loss of DAPK expression and formation of lung metastases (4Inbal B. Cohen O. Polak-Charcon S. Kopolovic J. Vadai E. Eisenbach L. Kimchi A. Nature. 1997; 390: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The structure/function dissection of the protein revealed two modules that inhibit the pro-apoptotic effect of DAPK. One comprises the CaM-regulatory segment, which possesses an auto-inhibitory effect on the catalytic activity, relieved by binding to Ca2+-activated CaM (2Cohen O. Feinstein E. Kimchi A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 998-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Consistently, the mere deletion of this segment from DAPK (ΔCaM mutant) generated a constitutively active kinase, which displayed CaM-independent substrate phosphorylation (using myosin light chain (MLC) as a substrate), and enhanced the apoptotic activity in vivo (2Cohen O. Feinstein E. Kimchi A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 998-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). A second auto-inhibitory domain that affects the pro-apoptotic function of DAPK resides in its C-terminal serine-rich tail (12Raveh T. Berissi H. Eisenstein M. Spivak T. Kimchi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1572-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism that may release the protein from auto-inhibition, leading to its activation has not yet been studied. In addition to the common theme of CaM-mediated relief from auto-inhibition that characterizes the various CaM-regulated kinases (13James P. Vorherr T. Carafoli E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 38-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 14Soderling T.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 232-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), these kinases frequently possess a second layer of regulation, which is modulated by phosphorylation at specific sites. Both autophosphorylations and transphosphorylations by other kinases have been identified, differing in their position in the protein as well as in their effects on the catalytic activity. In several well studied cases, phosphorylation positively affects the enzymatic activity. For example, the catalytic activity of CaM-regulated protein kinase I (CaMKI) and IV (CaMKIV), is stimulated by another kinase, CaMK kinase, which phosphorylates a threonine residue residing within the activation loop in their catalytic domains (14Soderling T.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 232-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 15Haribabu B. Hook S.S. Selbert M.A. Goldstein E.G. Tomhave E.D. Edelman A.M. Snyderman R.

Chem. 1995; 270: 17616-17621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In another example, autophosphorylation of CaMKII on Thr286, residing in the CaM-regulatory domain, activates substrate phosphorylation by relieving the inhibitory effects of this region (17Lou L.L. Schulman H. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 2020-2032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Schworer C.M. Colbran R.J. Keefer J.R. Soderling T.R. J. Biol.

This positive phosphorylation has previously been shown to be required for long term potentiation and learning capability in mice (20Giese K.P. Fedorov N.B. Filipkowski R.K. Silva A.J. Science. 1998; 279: 870-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Positive autophosphorylation within the CaM-regulatory domain has also been documented in smooth muscle MLCK at Thr803 (21Miller J.R. Silver P.J. Stull J.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1983; 24: 235-242PubMed Google Scholar, 22Tokui T. Ando S. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5173-5179Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 23Abe M. Hasegawa K. Hosoya H. Cell Struct. Funct. 1996; 21: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Thus, distinct Ser/Thr phosphorylations affect the kinase activity of these family members mostly by positive regulation. In contrast, here we found that DAPK is negatively regulated by autophosphorylation. We identified a major autophosphorylation site on Ser308 in the CaM-regulatory domain, which occurs at the basal state (absence of Ca2+/CaM) and is inversely correlated with substrate phosphorylation. This type of autophosphorylation takes place in vivo in growing cells and is strongly reduced by C6-ceramide treatment. Abrogation of phosphorylation by the substitution of Ser308 with alanine generated a “gain of function” mutant of DAPK, which exerted super-killing activity in vivo, whereas the reversed mutation to aspartic acid weakened almost completely the death-promoting effects. At the biochemical level, the conversion to alanine increased both the basal Ca2+/CaM-independent catalytic activity as well as the binding of the enzyme to its activator, CaM, whereas the mutation to aspartic acid reduced very strongly these two different catalytic features. We propose a novel autoregulatory mechanism for DAPK in which autophosphorylation of Ser308 serves as a locking device in the basal state. The autophosphorylation imposes charge-dependent interactions of the CaM-regulatory segment with the catalytic cleft and the ATP binding site, and lowers the susceptibility of the enzyme to activation by CaM by reducing the binding capacity of the enzyme to its activator, CaM. Dephosphorylation at this site relieves the protein from this mechanism of auto-inhibition and stimulates its pro-apoptotic functions. DAPK expression vectors were prepared in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). In all constructs, the DAPK sequence was tagged with the Flag epitope at the N terminus. The kinase domain (amino acids 1–319) was excised from full-length DAPK and was inserted into pcDNA3. Kinase domain mutants K42A(320)S308A(320), S313A(320), and S308/S313A(320) were generated by introducing point mutations to the wild-type kinase domain, using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The full-length DAPK mutants, S308A(f.l) and S308D(f.l), were prepared by replacing a section in the full-length wild-type sequence with a sequence spanning the indicated point mutations. 293 human embryonic kidney cells and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Biological Industries) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 4 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. Transient transfections of 293 cells were done using calcium phosphate method as described previously (2Cohen O. Feinstein E. Kimchi A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 998-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 3Cohen O. Inbal B. Kissil J.L. Raveh T. Berissi H. Spivak-Kroizaman T. Feinstein E. Kimchi A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). HeLa transfections were carried out with Superfect reagent (Qiagen). Extraction of the kinase domain was performed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, 1.5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml chymostatin, 0.1 mm NaVO3, 10 mmNaPPi, and 0.1 mm NaF). Extraction of the full-length enzyme was performed in cold phosphate lysis buffer as described previously (2Cohen O. Feinstein E. Kimchi A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 998-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 3Cohen O. Inbal B. Kissil J.L. Raveh T. Berissi H. Spivak-Kroizaman T. Feinstein E. Kimchi A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, the supernatants were incubated with anti-Flag monoclonal antibodies coupled to agarose beads (M2 affinity gel; IBI Kodak) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG monoclonal antibodies (IBI Kodak). Proteins were detected using the ECL detection reagent and autoradiography. DAPK constructs were immunoprecipitated from transfected 293 cells and washed twice with reaction buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 8 mmMgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2). Samples were incubated for 8 min at 30 °C in 30 μl reaction buffer containing 9 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (1.8 pmol), 50 μm ATP, and 2 μg of chicken gizzard MLC (Sigma) or, where indicated, rabbit MLC (kindly provided by M. Gautel, Max-Plane-Institut, Dortmund, Germany). In all experiments the molar ratio between the different kinase forms and the substrate, MLC, did not exceed the 1:4 ratio. When indicated, 1 μm bovine calmodulin (Sigma) and 0.5 mm CaCl2 or 3 mm EGTA was added. Proteins were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Kinase activity (autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of MLC) was visualized by autoradiography of the 32P-labeled proteins. To determine the levels of proteins in the samples, membranes were subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-Flag monoclonal antibodies. The band intensity was quantified by densitometric analysis. Equal amounts of immunoprecipitated Flag-tagged kinase domain mutants were preincubated for 8 min at 30 °C in kinase reaction buffer containing EGTA and ATP (but no MLC) for maximal autophosphorylation. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was preincubated for 1 h in CaM binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2) containing 10% nonfat dry milk powder. Following this blocking, recombinant 35S-labeled calmodulin at 17 nm final concentration (generously provided by H. Frum, Weizmann Institute, Rehovot, Israel) was added, and the membrane was shaken gently at room temperature for 16 h, washed three times (5 min each) in calmodulin binding buffer, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. Flag-DAPK was detected on Western blots using anti-Flag antibodies and ECL. Equal amounts of immunoprecipitated Flag-tagged full-length DAPK mutants were incubated for 1.5 h at 30 °C with 10, 100, and 1000 nmrecombinant 35S-labeled CaM in CaM binding buffer. The proteins were washed five times (15 min each) in calmodulin binding buffer, and 1 ml of scintillation fluid (Ultima Gold, Packard) was added to each point. The bound radioactivity was assessed by a standard β-counter (Packard). The ΔCaM mutant, which lacks the CaM-binding region, served to assess the nonspecific background in these binding assays. Background radioactivity still present in the ΔCaM DAPK mutant sample was subtracted from each tested sample. Transient transfections for apoptotic assays were done in six-well plates. For each well we used a mixture containing 1.7 μg of DAPK pcDNA and 0.5 μg of pEGFP plasmid (CLONTECH). Cells were counted 18 and 20 h after transfection. In each transfection, six fields, each consisting of 100 GFP-positive cells, were scored for apoptotic cell morphology. All the experiments were repeated at least three times. At the indicated time points, cell lysates were prepared from the transient transfections and the relative expression levels of each construct was determined by Western blotting. HFB cells (HeLa cells carrying Fas receptors) were transfected with Flag-tagged WT(320) or S308A(320) and extracted with the above mentioned lysis buffer, which in addition includes 200 nm okadaic acid. The lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphoserine antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) (1:100). An aliquot of the cell extracts was left for determination of the relative amount of the recombinant proteins. The proteins were fractionated on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and reacted with anti-Flag antibodies. To determine the effect of an apoptotic stimulus on Ser308 phosphorylation, HFB cells transfected with WT(320) and S308A(320) were treated for the last 60 min before their harvest with C6-ceramide (40 μm). The model structure of the kinase domain of DAPK was based on the x-ray structure of phosphorylase kinase in complex with a peptide substrate (Ref. 24Lowe E.D. Noble M.E. Skamnaki V.T. Oikonomakos N.G. Owen D.J. Johnson L.N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6646-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar; Protein Data Bank code2phk); hence, the kinase is in a closed conformation. The characteristically conserved residues in the kinase domain were easily identified and used to verify the Psi Blast alignment of DAPK and phosphorylase kinase (25Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar). Hence, despite the low sequence identity (36%), a reliable model could be built except for a short positive segment (residues 45–55), which maps to a short helix in 2phk, although its sequence does not comply with a helical secondary structure. The model was constructed using the Homology module of MSI (MSI Inc., San Diego, CA). It was verified by calculating the three-dimensional/one-dimensional self-compatibility score (26Luthy R. Bowie J.U. Eisenberg D. Nature. 1992; 356: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2616) Google Scholar), which was 103.1 (the expected score for a protein of this length is 118.6). The electrostatic potential of the kinase domain was calculated using the program Delphi (27Gilson M.K. Honig B. Proteins. 1988; 4: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar) with parameter for solvation energy charges and atomic radii (28Sitkoff D. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Biophys. Chem. 1994; 51: 397-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The binding of the peptide to the kinase domain of DAPK was modeled in analogy to the binding of the peptide substrate to phosphorylase kinase. To assess the effect of phosphorylation of Ser308 on the binding to CaM, we constructed a model structure of the CaM-binding segment with CaM. To this end, we aligned the CaM-binding segment of DAPK with the corresponding segment of MLCK, whose structure in complex with CaM has been determined experimentally (Ref. 29Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1992; 257: 1251-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar; Protein Data Bank code 1cdl), and built the structure of the complex assuming that the overall conformation of the peptide-bound CaM molecule is not affected. It has been shown previously that DAPK undergoes autophosphorylation (1Deiss L.P. Feinstein E. Berissi H. Cohen O. Kimchi A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), but the position of the phosphorylation sites and their possible functional relevance have not been addressed. Because the pro-apoptotic effect of DAPK depends on its catalytic activity, we asked whether any of these autophosphorylation sites may reside in the kinase domain and whether they provide an additional layer of regulation modulating the catalytic activity. To this end, a miniprotein spanning the catalytic and CaM-regulatory segments of DAPK was constructed (referred to as WT(320); see the scheme in Fig. 2). This protein was transiently expressed in 293 cells, immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibodies, and subjected to in vitro kinase assay performed either in the absence (EGTA) or presence of Ca2+/CaM. Both autophosphorylation and the phosphorylation of the external substrate MLC were assessed. For comparison, the full-length recombinant DAPK was subjected to a similarin vitro kinase assay. It was found that the kinase domain retained its ability to undergo autophosphorylation, thus confirming the presence of potential phosphorylation sites in this region. Surprisingly, however, and in contrast to the full-length protein, the kinase domain showed considerably lower levels of autophosphorylation in the presence of Ca2+/CaM than in its absence (Fig. 1, A and B). As for MLC phosphorylation by WT(320), it was minimal in EGTA and was further stimulated by Ca2+/CaM, similar to substrate phosphorylation by the full-length protein. Thus, an inverse relationship between the autophosphorylation of the kinase domain and the phosphorylation of an external substrate was clearly documented. The reduced autophosphorylation was not dependent on the presence of MLC (data not shown), thus excluding possible substrate competition. This inverse relationship was not apparent when the full-length protein was assessed (Fig. 1, A and B), probably because of masking of these sites by additional sites along the noncatalytic segments of DAPK whose phosphorylation may instead be stimulated by Ca2+/CaM.Figure 1DAPK autophosphorylation and MLC phosphorylation: regulation by Ca2+/CaM. A, full-length DAPK (WT(f.l)) and DAPK miniprotein, consisting of the catalytic unit followed by CaM-regulatory segment (WT(320)), were assayed in vitro for kinase activity in the presence or absence of Ca2+/CaM (upper panel). Proteins were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and autoradiographed.

The catalytic segment by itself (referred to as WT(280); see scheme in Fig. 2), although retaining constitutive activity toward MLC, was not significantly autophosphorylated (data not shown), thus directing the subsequent mapping efforts toward the CaM-regulatory domain. This segment of DAPK contains several potential phosphorylation sites. Alignment of this stretch with the corresponding domains of other CaM-regulated kinases pointed out that Ser308 and Ser313 residues are conserved in the closely related DAPK homologue, DRP-1 (30Inbal B. Shani G. Cohen O. Kissil J.L. Kimchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1044-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2) and inCaenorhabditis elegans DAPK (data not shown). To determine whether these two serines are targets for autophosphorylation by DAPK, a double mutant in which Ser308 and Ser313 were both converted to alanines was constructed.In vitro kinase assays revealed that this double mutant (referred to as S308/S313A(320)) had lost most of its ability to undergo autophosphorylation in the presence of EGTA (Fig. 3, A and C). This indicated that Ser308, Ser313, or both are the exclusive autophosphorylated residues in the kinase domain. Single mutations were then introduced individually into the kinase domain fragment (S308A(320) and S313A(320), respectively). The conversion of Ser308 to Ala resulted in the most profound effect, reducing autophosphorylation levels by 90% (Fig. 3, B and C). In contrast, Ser313 substitution had much milder, although statistically significant, effects on basal autophosphorylation (40% reduction on average; Fig. 3 C) and did not affect the Ca2+/CaM-induced decline (Fig. 3 B). Thus, the major site of autophosphorylation was mapped to Ser308 in the CaM-binding domain. Next, we examined the effects of these mutations on MLC phosphorylation. It was found that elimination of the major phosphorylation site at Ser308 resulted in elevation of basal MLC phosphorylation in the absence of Ca2+/CaM. This type of Ca2+/CaM-independent activity was observed both in the double mutant (Fig. 3, A and D) and the S308A(320) mutant (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, the S313A(320) mutant did not differ from the wild type fragment and displayed low basal activity toward MLC in the absence of Ca2+/CaM (Fig. 3 B). Thus, it appears that mutation at Ser308, which eliminated most of the autophosphorylation, partially released the kinase domain from the strict auto-inhibition imposed by the CaM-regulatory region. Still, the overall responsiveness to CaM was retained, as S308A/S313A(320) (Fig. 3, A and D) and S308A(320) (Figs. 3 B and 4 A) fragments reached the same maximal levels of activity in the presence of high concentrations (1 μm) of Ca2+/CaM. Testing MLC phosphorylation at low CaM concentrations (e.g.10−1 nm) highlighted a second feature, which was acquired by the Ser to Ala mutation. Although the wild type fragment was refractory to these low CaM levels, the S308A(320) mutant displayed prominent elevations in MLC phosphorylation over the high basal levels (Fig. 4 A). The ability of S308A(320) to respond to lower CaM concentrations than the WT form was observed repeatedly (p < 0.01). CaM concentration curves indicated 100-fold relative shift in the CaM activation constant (data not shown). Of note, the elevated basal activity of S308A in the presence of EGTA reflects the mere CaM-independent activity rather than a response to low CaM levels, which may contaminate the MLC preparation. That is because CaM, even at high concentrations, has no effect in the absence of Ca2+(i.e. in the presence of EGTA), both in the WT and S308A mutant form. The higher response of S308A(320) to CaM opened up a series of experiments where the binding activity of the kinase domains to recombinant CaM was directly tested. To this end, a CaM overlay assay was performed, in which the different mutants were compared for their ability to bind radiolabeled CaM on immunoblots. It was found that S308A/S313A(320) and S308A(320) mutants each displayed higher CaM binding capability than the wild type kinase domain or the S313A(320) mutant (Fig. 4 B). Thus, by mimicking the dephosphorylated state on Ser308 with the alanine mutation, the binding capability to CaM was clearly increased. Next, the effect of the single mutation was examined in the context of the full-length protein. To this end, Ser308 within the full-length protein was substituted either to Ala or to Asp, thus mimicking dephosphorylated or fully phosphorylated states at position 308, respectively (referred to as S308A(f.l) and S308D(f.l)). In experiments where the proteins were incubated with increasing concentration of 35S-labeled CaM, S308D(f.l) displayed considerably low CaM-binding capability as detected under all tested CaM concentrations (10–1000 nm). Conversely, the substitution to alanine increased the binding capability compared with WT(f.l) as mainly detected at the 10 nm and 100 nm CaM concentrations (Fig. 4C). Additionally, as seen with the short fragment, the substitution to alanine also elevated the Ca2+/CaM-independent MLC phosphorylation, whereas the mutation to aspartic acid minimized it (Fig. 4 D). Thus, prevention of phosphorylation on Ser308 within the full-length enzyme promotes Ca2+/CaM-independent activity and the binding to its activator, CaM, whereas the presence of a negative charge on the same site acts to down-regulate these two properties, suggesting that phosphorylation inhibits different aspects of the catalytic activity. Once the biochemical relevance of Ser308 phosphorylation was established in vitro, it was important to find out whether it also occurs in vivo in growing cells and whether this site is subje"

The principle coat components, clathrin and the AP-2 adaptor complex, assemble a polyhedral lattice at plasma membrane bud sites with the aid of several endocytic accessory proteins. Here, we show that huntingtin-interacting protein 1 (HIP1), a binding partner of huntingtin, copurifies with brain clathrin-coated vesicles and associates directly with both AP-2 and clathrin. The discrete interaction sequences within HIP1 that facilitate binding are analogous to motifs present in other accessory proteins, including AP180, amphiphysin, and epsin. Bound to a phosphoinositide-containing membrane surface via an epsin N-terminalhomology (ENTH) domain, HIP1 associates with AP-2 to provide coincident clathrin-binding sites that together efficiently recruit clathrin to the bilayer. Our data implicate HIP1 in endocytosis, and the similar modular architecture and function of HIP1, epsin, and AP180 suggest a common role in lipid-regulated clathrin lattice biogenesis.

Associations with the AP-2 adaptor complex generally involve the independently folded appendage domains of the large α (αA or αC isoform) and β2 subunits, each separated from the heterotetrameric adaptor core by a flexible hinge. Despite only ∼10% sequence identity, the fold of the β2 appendage (14Owen D.J. Vallis Y. Pearse B.M. McMahon H.T. Evans P.R.

The privileged association of accessory factors with the core endocytic machinery is due to discrete interaction sequences located within each accessory protein. In epsin and eps15, the AP-2 αC-binding sequence is Asp-Pro-Trp (DPW) and Asp-Pro-Phe (DPF), respectively, each protein bearing multiple triplets arrayed in a tandem fashion.

Instead, in these proteins, and the long splice isoform of phosphoinositide polyphosphatase synaptojanin, SJ170, an alternate binding motif is based upon the di-aromatic consensus sequence FXDXF (where X is any amino acid). Several of the designated AP-2-binding accessory proteins also interact directly with clathrin.

Here, we identify an additional protein, huntingtin-interacting protein 1 (HIP1),1 which displays canonical AP-2- and clathrin-binding motifs as well as overall domain organization and functional properties akin to epsin, AP180, and amphiphysin. Our data strongly implicate HIP1 in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-HIP1M1 (residues 311–394) and M2 (residues 311–369) were prepared using appropriate polymerase chain reaction primers and human EST xd79f07.x1 (Research Genetics) as the template. The inserts were ligated, after digestion, into EcoRI/XhoI-cleaved pGEX-4T-1. A similar polymerase chain reaction-based strategy was used to insert the human HIP1M1 segment into pcDNA3.1 with an N-terminal myc-epitope tag. The GST-mHIP1-(1–533) fusion construct was prepared to contain in-frame insertion of nucleotide 1–1599 of mouse HIP1. GST-SJ170C2 (residues 1454–1530) and GST-epsin 1-(1–407) were prepared similarly using human EST nf51b08.s1 (Incyte Genomics) and rat epsin 1 cDNA, kindly provided by Pietro De Camilli, respectively. Mutations were generated using appropriate mutagenic primers with the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) as described elsewhere (10Drake M.T. Downs M.A. Traub L.M. J. Biol.

After lysis in B-PER (Pierce), soluble protein was purified on glutathione (GSH)-Sepharose, eluted with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm GSH, 5 mm DTT, and then dialyzed into phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mm DTT. Human HIP1M1 (residues 311–394), HIP1M2 (residues 311–369), and epsin DPW (residues 249–407) were cleaved from GST with thrombin, followed by addition of the irreversible thrombin inhibitor PPACK (d-Phe-Pro-Arg chloromethyl ketone, Calbiochem) to a final concentration of 25 μm. For the GST-mHIP1-(1–533), the purified recombinant protein was first dialyzed to remove GSH and then treated with thrombin to cleave off the HIP1 segment. Liberated GST was removed by adding a second aliquot of GSH-Sepharose and collecting the unbound fraction as mHIP1-(1–533). Clathrin and AP-2 were purified from rat brain clathrin-coated vesicles by Tris extraction followed by sequential chromatography over Superose 6 and hydroxylapatite (23Ahle S. Ungewickell E.

Pooled clathrin- or AP-2-containing fractions were gel-filtered into assay buffer and centrifuged at 134,000 ×g max before use in binding assays. For pull-down-type assays, GST or GST fusion proteins were first immobilized on GSH-Sepharose, washed in assay buffer, and then mixed with clarified rat brain cytosol/detergent extract to give a final concentration of ∼7.5 mg/ml in 300 μl of total volume (10Drake M.T.

Aliquots of 10 μg of mHIP1-(1–533), GST-epsin-(1–407), AP-2, or combinations thereof, were first preincubated with 0.5 mg/ml liposomes for 60 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g max for 15 min, the lipid pellets were resuspended in assay buffer, then 5 μg of clathrin was added and the volume was adjusted to 200 μl. Both stages contained 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin as a protein carrier. After a further 60-min incubation at 4 °C, the liposomes were again centrifuged and the pellets resuspended in SDS-sample buffer. Aliquots corresponding to 1/25 of each supernatant and 1/4 of each pellet were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. COS-7 cells were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm l-glutamine. Cells plated on poly-l-lysine-coated round glass coverslips were transfected with DEAE-dextran and, after 48 h, incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 60 min. Biotinylated human transferrin (25 μg/ml) was then added and incubation continued for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy as described previously (10Drake M.T. Downs M.A. Traub L.M. J. Biol.

Polyclonal antibodies directed against HIP1 were generated by immunizing rabbits with the GST-HIP1M1 fusion protein. Anti-HIP1 antibodies were affinity-purified on thrombin-cleaved HIP1M1 coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B using standard procedures. The sources of the antibodies against clathrin, the AP-2 subunits, epsin, amphiphysin, AP180, and eps15 have been described previously (10Drake M.T. Downs M.A. Traub L.M. J. Biol.

Anti-myc mAb 9E10 was from Covance, and the anti-synaptotagmin I mAb was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Searching the data bases for additional proteins that contain the AP-2 binding FXDXF motif, we identified HIP1. This protein was initially discovered in screens for binding partners of huntingtin (26Kalchman M.A. Koide H.B. McCutcheon K. Graham R.K. Nichol K. Nishiyama K. Kazemi-Esfarjani P. Lynn F.C.

HIP1 displays a modular domain architecture: an epsinN-terminal homology (ENTH) domain precedes a central region predicted to have a high propensity for coiled-coil formation, followed by a C-terminal talin-homology (I/L)WEQ domain (Fig. 1 A). Within the central region of the protein, before the coiled-coil segment, a stretch of three interwoven FX(N/D/S)X(F/L) motifs proceeds a single DPF triplet (Fig. 1 B). Significantly, this region of HIP1 is quite divergent from HIP1R (Fig.1 B), a related protein roughly 50% identical to HIP1 that localizes to clathrin-coated pits (28Engqvist-Goldstein A.E. Kessels M.M. Chopra V.S. Hayden M.R. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1503-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The presence of these motifs within HIP1 is intriguing, because the intracellular staining pattern of HIP1 is highly reminiscent of AP-2 and clathrin (29Chopra V.S. Metzler M. Rasper D.M. Engqvist-Goldstein A.E. Singaraja R. Gan L. Fichter K.M. McCutcheon K. Drubin D. Nicholson D.W. Hayden M.R. Mamm.

Affinity-purified anti-HIP1 antibodies detect a major ∼120-kDa polypeptide with a distribution that, on subcellular fractionation, clearly parallels that of both clathrin and the AP-2 adaptor complex (Fig. 2). Like HIP1, a major fraction of AP180 is also recovered in the clathrin-coated vesicle fraction also containing the recycling synaptic vesicle transmembrane protein synaptotagmin I (right panel,lane d) (5Chen H. Fre S. Slepnev V.I. Capua M.R. Takei K. Butler M.H. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. Nature. 1998; 394: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 23Ahle S. Ungewickell E. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3143-3149Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). By contrast, although present, other accessory proteins, including epsin 1 and amphiphysin, are not correspondingly enriched within the purified coated vesicle fraction (lane c compared with lane d) and substantial cytosolic pools of these proteins exist (lane c) (5Chen H. Fre S. Slepnev V.I. Capua M.R. Takei K. Butler M.H. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. Nature. 1998; 394: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). These results show that HIP1 is significantly enriched in clathrin-coated endocytic vesicles found in brain.Figure 2HIP1 is a component of clathrin-coated vesicles. Aliquots of 20 μg each of rat brain homogenate, crude microsomes, cytosol, and purified clathrin-coated vesicles were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and either stained with Coomassie Blue (left panel) or transferred to nitrocellulose (right panels) and probed with antibodies directed against the clathrin light chains (LC), the μ2 subunit of the AP-2 complex, HIP1, AP180, epsin 1, amphiphysin, or synaptotagmin I. The position of the molecular mass standards (in kDa) and the ∼180-kDa clathrin heavy chain (HC) (left panel) are indicated on theleft and right, respectively. Only the relevant portion of each blot (right panels) is shown. Proteolysis of the clathrin light chains in the coated vesicle preparation suggests the lower ∼80-kDa band detected by the anti-HIP1 antibodies is likely to be a degradation product.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To assess whether the region harboring the FXDXF and DPF-type sequences does actually facilitate an interaction with AP-2, brain cytosol was incubated with GST fusion proteins containing this region of human HIP1. The HIP1M1 and M2 fusion proteins (see Fig.1 A) both pull down AP-2 near quantitatively (Fig.3 A, lanes f andh), whereas GST alone fails to interact with the adaptor complex (lane b), which remains in the supernatant (lane a). The presence of the μ2 adaptor subunit verifies that the heterotetrameric AP-2 adaptor complexes bind, and, in these assays, the extent of AP-2 association with the HIP1 fusions is similar to that seen with the GST-SJ170C2 fusion (lane d), which contains residues 1454–1530 of human SJ170 harboring the sequence1462GFKDSF1467. Importantly, the soluble, native HIP1 protein also binds to the isolated αC-appendage domain of AP-2. When incubated with brain cytosol, GST-αC binds to AP180, epsin (Fig.3 B, lane f), eps15, and amphiphysin I and II (see Fig. 3 C) (15Owen D.J. Vallis Y. Noble M.E. Hunter J.B. Dafforn T.R. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Cell. 1999; 97: 805-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 16Traub L.M. Downs M.A. Westrich J.L. Fremont D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8907-8912Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), but, because there is very little HIP1 in cytosolic extracts (Fig. 2), only low level HIP1 association is observed (Fig. 3 B, right panel, lane f). HIP1 is more abundant in a rat brain detergent extract (12Slepnev V.I. Ochoa G.C. Butler M.H. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17583-17589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 B, lane c), and, after incubation with this extract, a prominent additional ∼120-kDa band is recovered together with the common binding partners on the GST-αCbeads (Fig. 2 B, left panel, lane hcompared with lane f). This major polypeptide is confirmed to be HIP1 by immunoblotting (right panel, lane h). The substantially enhanced recovery of native HIP1 on the GST-αC beads without a concomitant increase in the other appendage partners again argues that the HIP1-AP-2 interaction is direct. To confirm that HIP1 engages the same binding surface on the αC appendage utilized by other endocytic accessory proteins, we tested the capacity of the AP-2-binding region of HIP1 to inhibit the association of other cytosolic accessory proteins with the immobilized GST-αC appendage. As a control, supplementing brain cytosol with 20 μm epsin 1 DPW domain (which contains eight tandemly arrayed DPW triplets) completely abrogates amphiphysin and AP180 binding and only low level epsin and eps15 association remains (Fig. 3C, lane f) (15Owen D.J. Vallis Y. Noble M.E. Hunter J.B. Dafforn T.R. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Cell. 1999; 97: 805-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Because the added DPW domain abolishes associations when bound substoichiometrically to the αC appendage (left panel, lane f), a single DPW domain is capable of engaging multiple appendages simultaneously. By contrast, addition of 20 μm HIP1M2 affects neither epsin nor eps15 binding (lane h). Instead, this concentration of the HIP1 fragment totally inhibits AP180 binding and partially interferes with the amphiphysin interaction (lane h). Thus, the HIP1 fragment inhibits the αC partner associations in the reverse order of their apparent affinity for GST-αC (epsin ≈ eps15 > amphiphysin > AP180) (16Traub L.M. Downs M.A. Westrich J.L. Fremont D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8907-8912Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar); the cooperative effect of the multiple DP(F/W) triplets in eps15 and epsin resists efficient HIP1 competition under these conditions. 2If the density of the GST-αCappendage immobilized on GSH-Sepharose is reduced 5- to 10-fold, increasing the relative spacing of the individual appendages, then the FXDXF-bearing SJ170C2 fragment is able to inhibit soluble eps15 and epsin binding (T. J. Brett, D. H. Fremont, and L. M. Traub, unpublished observations). This supports the notion that the cooperativity of the tandemly arrayed DP(F/W) triplets in eps15 and epsin prevents efficient competition by the HIP1M1 segment. DPF and FXDXF sequences both bind directly to the αC appendage. 3T. J. Brett, L. M. Traub, and D. H. Fremont, manuscript submitted for publication.To gain some insight into the relative contribution of these two sequences within HIP1 to AP-2 binding, the DPF triplet was altered to KPS using site-directed mutagenesis. This substitution severely compromises the ability of the GST-HIP1M2 fusion to associate with soluble AP-2 (Fig. 3 A, lanes i and j) but clearly does not abolish adaptor binding totally. We conclude from these experiments that HIP1 binds to AP-2 directly by engaging the common binding surface on the platform subdomain of the αC appendage and that the distal DPF sequence appears to be the dominant ligand. We attribute the remaining adaptor binding observed with the DPF mutant to the proximal FXDXF motif. Significantly, all of the known accessory proteins containing the FXDXF motif (amphiphysin, AP180, SJ170, HIP1) have one or more DX(F/W) triplet located adjacent to this sequence. In addition to binding to AP-2 adaptors, the HIP1-GST fusion proteins also affinity-purify a prominent ∼180-kDa polypeptide (Fig. 3 A,left panel, lane f and h). Antibodies identify this protein as the clathrin heavy chain and the cognate light chains, although not visible on the stained gel, are also detected on the blots. 4Although cytosolic clathrin binds avidly to the HIP1 GST fusions, we note that HIP1M1 reproducibly interacts more efficiently with soluble trimers than the HIP1M2 segment. It is well established that the hinge and appendage regions of the AP-2 β2-subunit interact with clathrin directly (14Owen D.J. Vallis Y. Pearse B.M. McMahon H.T. Evans P.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4216-4227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Dell'Angelica E.C. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 315-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), yet the observed association of GST-HIP1 with clathrin is not simply due to the presence of bound AP-2. No clathrin associates with the GST-SJ170C2 fusion protein, despite it binding similar amounts of AP-2 (lane d). Closer inspection of the HIP1 sequence reveals a putative clathrin box proximal to the AP-2-binding elements (Fig. 1 B). The sequence, LMDMD, is an unusual variation on the type I consensus L(L/I)(D/E/N)(L/F)(D/E) (32Dell'Angelica E.C. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 315-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), which binds to a shallow groove located between blades 1 and 2 of the clathrin heavy chain β-propeller (19ter Haar E. Harrison S.C. Kirchhausen T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1096-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The role of this region in clathrin binding was probed by altering the sequence to AAAMD (LMD → AAA; Fig. 4). Compared with the native sequence (lane d), this mutation abolishes clathrin binding completely but leaves the AP-2 interaction intact (lane f). This result implicates the LMDMD in binding clathrin directly but, interestingly, in the GST-HIP1M2 (DPF → KPS) mutant, which still contains an intact clathrin box, clathrin binding is strongly diminished (Fig. 3 A, lane j). These results are identical to the behavior of the clathrin-binding sequence257LMDLADV263 located within the DPW domain of rat epsin 1, proximal to the tandemly arrayed eight DPW repeats (10Drake M.T. Downs M.A. Traub L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6479-6489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). There, again, robust clathrin binding is dependent upon AP-2 recruitment, providing coincident binding motifs for the terminal domain of the clathrin heavy chain.

During atherogenesis, intimal macrophages internalize atherogenic lipoproteins, including modified forms of LDL, that have been retained in the arterial subendothelium (1Ross R. Annu. Rev.

Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 551-561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This event directly leads to esterification of cellular cholesterol by acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterolO-acyltransferase (ACAT), resulting in “foam cell” formation (3Tabas I. Biochim. Biophys.

Foam cell formation can be prevented or reversed by the process known as cellular cholesterol efflux (6Tall A.R. Eur. Heart J. 1998; 19: A31-A35PubMed Google Scholar). Cholesterol efflux is the initial step of reverse cholesterol transport, a process whereby excess cholesterol in peripheral cells is delivered to the liver for excretion (6Tall A.R. Eur. Heart J. 1998; 19: A31-A35PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the elucidation of cellular molecules and pathways that facilitate and regulate cholesterol efflux is a major goal of research in the area of atherosclerosis.Atherogenic lipoproteins internalized by macrophages deliver their stores of cholesterol, which are mostly in the form of CE, to late endosomes and/or lysosomes (3Tabas I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Here, lysosomal acid lipase hydrolyzes the CE to free cholesterol, which is then transported by poorly defined mechanisms to various sites in the cell (3Tabas I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A major site of transport is the plasma membrane, and from there the cholesterol can be effluxed to extracellular acceptors, such as apoA-I and HDL, or transported to ACAT in the endoplasmic reticulum for re-esterification (3Tabas I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 6Tall A.R. Eur. Heart J. 1998; 19: A31-A35PubMed Google Scholar). Efflux to apoA-I involves the initial formation of phospholipid-apoA-I particles by ABCA1-mediated phospholipid efflux, followed by cholesterol efflux to these phospholipid-rich particles (7Wang N.

Cholesterol efflux to HDL can be mediated by scavenger receptor type B1 (SR-B1) in those cell types that have relatively high levels of this receptor, such as human monocyte-derived macrophages, but another mechanism must be involved in cells that have very low expression of SR-B1, such as mouse peritoneal macrophages 2Y.

Thus far, only the molecules npc1, npc2 (HE1), and possibly lysobisphosphatidic acid have been shown to play a role in cholesterol transport to the plasma membrane, and the molecular mechanisms are poorly understood (11Liscum L.

We reasoned that another molecule, lysosomal sphingomyelinase (L-SMase), may also be involved in cholesterol transport from lysosomes to the plasma membrane. L-SMase, a product of the acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) gene, hydrolyzes sphingomyelin in late endosomes and lysosomes (16Schuchman E.H. Desnick R.J. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D.

Of interest, humans with ASM deficiency (types A and B Niemann-Pick disease) have low plasma HDL levels (19Viana M.B. Giugliani R. Leite V.H. Barth M.L. Lekhwani C. Slade C.M. Fensom A. J. Med.

Moreover, a defect in cholesterol efflux was also observed in wild-type macrophages that internalized a large amount of sphingomyelin. These data support the hypothesis that intracellular accumulation of sphingomyelin due to L-SMase deficiency or to internalization of excess sphingomyelin leads to cholesterol sequestration and defective cholesterol trafficking and efflux.DISCUSSIONThe results of this study have implications ranging from the basic cellular biology of lipid trafficking to the important physiologic area of macrophage cholesterol efflux in atherosclerosis.

The idea that the sphingomyelin content of lysosomes could be an important regulatory factor is based upon the ability of this lipid to bind cholesterol (17Slotte J.P. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 102: 13-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 18Ridgway N.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1484: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Indeed, Aviram and colleagues (42Maor I. Mandel H. Aviram M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1378-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) suggested that the ability of oxysterols in oxidized LDL to inhibit L-SMase in murine and human macrophages may account for the accumulation of lysosomal FC under these conditions, although molecular genetic proof was not provided to support their hypothesis. In contrast, cholesterol esterification and trafficking to the plasma membrane were reported as being normal in several lines of fibroblasts from humans with types A and B Niemann-Pick disease (43Liscum L. Ruggiero R.M. Faust J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1625-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar,44Pentchev P.G. Comly M.E. Kruth H.S. Vanier M.T. Wenger D.A. Patel S. Brady R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8247-8251Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). It is possible that the human fibroblasts data could have been influenced by residual L-SMase activity in these cells (16Schuchman E.H. Desnick R.J. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2601-2624Google Scholar) or by inherent differences in cholesterol trafficking between fibroblasts and macrophages.Our working hypothesis states that defective cholesterol trafficking in ASM knockout macrophages is due to sequestration of cholesterol by sphingomyelin. This model can readily explain the acetyl-LDL-cholesterol trafficking data, because acetyl-LDL-derived cholesterol traffics through lysosomes, which is a known site of SM accumulation in ASM-deficient cells (16Schuchman E.H. Desnick R.J. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2601-2624Google Scholar). With regard to those experiments in which the macrophages were labeled by long-term incubation with [3H]cholesterol-containing medium, it is possible that this method also labels lysosomal pools of cholesterol. However, when a similar method was used in Chinese hamster ovary cells to incorporate the fluorescent sterol dehydroergosterol or cholesterol itself, followed by filipin labeling, the major sites of accumulation were the endosomal recycling compartment and the trans-Golgi network (35Mukherjee S. Zha X. Tabas I. Maxfield F.R. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1915-1925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). If this were the case in macrophages, it would indicate defective trafficking and efflux of non-lysosomal cholesterol and therefore might imply that ASM deficiency leads to SM accumulation in the endosomal recycling compartment, trans-Golgi network, or other nonlysosomal sites (cf. Refs. 15Kobayashi T. Beuchat M.H. Lindsay M. Frias S. Palmiter R.D. Sakuraba H. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 34Lange Y. Ye J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 4013-4021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This idea might also provide an explanation for our finding that not all of the acetyl-LDL-derived free cholesterol that accumulates in ASM-deficient macrophages is in dextran-containing late endosomes and lysosomes (Fig.6). Detailed sphingomyelin localization studies in ASM knockout macrophages will be required to sort out these possibilities.One must also consider the possibility that direct sequestration of cholesterol by SM is not the only mechanism behind defective cholesterol trafficking in ASM knockout macrophages. In this context, there is evidence that initial accumulation of unesterified cholesterol in lysosomes or late endosomes can lead to secondary defects in vesicular trafficking. For example, the defective trafficking of lactosyl ceramide in ASM-deficient fibroblasts and the defects in late endosomal tubulovesicular trafficking observed in NPC cells can be corrected by cellular cholesterol depletion (46Puri V. Watanabe R. Dominguez M. Sun X. Wheatley C.L. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 386-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 47Zhang M. Dwyer N.K. Neufeld E.B. Love D.C. Cooney A. Comly M. Patel S. Watari H. Strauss III, J.F. Pentchev P.G. Hanover J.A. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3417-3425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and defects in the trafficking of sucrose can be induced in normal cells by cellular cholesterol enrichment (48Zhang M. Dwyer N.K. Love D.C. Cooney A. Comly M. Neufeld E. Pentchev P.G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Hanover J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4466-4471Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that abnormal SM accumulation in ASM knockout macrophages causes an initial accumulation of FC in lysosomes or some other site, but that at least some of the trafficking and efflux defects observed in our studies are due to membrane vesiculation defects secondary to this initial cholesterol accumulation.The cholesterol trafficking defect described in this report is similar to that which occurs in fibroblasts from patients with Niemann-Pick C (NPC) disease (11Liscum L. Klansek J.J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 12Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1486: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 13Ory D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 14Naureckiene S. Sleat D.E. Lackland H. Fensom A. Vanier M.T. Wattiaux R. Jadot M. Lobel P. Science. 2000; 290: 2298-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent work from our groups has shown that macrophages from NPC mice have a defect in cholesterol trafficking (49Chen W. Sun Y. Welch C. Gorelik A. Leventhal A.R. Tabas I. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43564-43569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Although the molecular etiologies are distinct, important interrelationships between the cholesterol trafficking defects in ASM deficiency and Niemann-Pick C disease may exist. For example, Reaganet al. (50Reagan Jr., J.W. Hubbert M.L. Shelness G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38104-38110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) made the interesting observation that lysosomal cholesterol accumulation in Chinese hamster ovary cells induced by either the NPC mutation or progesterone causes a decrease in the enzymatic activity of L-SMase. Therefore, in view of our data, it is possible that the cholesterol trafficking defects in NPC cells and progesterone-treated cells may be amplified by secondary inhibition of L-SMase.The findings in this report may have important implications for foam cell biology. Macrophages in advanced lesions are known to accumulate large amount of free cholesterol, much of which appears to be in lysosomes (51Lundberg B. Atherosclerosis. 1985; 56: 93-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 52Small D.M. Bond M.G. Waugh D. Prack M. Sawyer J.K. J. Clin.

Glick J.M. Jerome W.G. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9653-9660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the one hand, it is possible that exposure of these macrophages to oxidized LDL or oxysterols, by inhibiting L-SMase (42Maor I. Mandel H. Aviram M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1378-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), or SM-rich lipoproteins, by “saturating” L-SMase (see Fig.6), may contribute to this event. Regarding this latter possibility, Jiang et al. (56Jiang X.C. Paultre F. Pearson T.A. Reed R.G. Francis C.K. Lin M. Berglund L. Tall A.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 2614-2618Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) recently found that a high plasma SM level is an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease in humans. On the other hand, the accumulation of lysosomal cholesterol, even if caused by another process, might be expected to secondarily inhibit L-SMase (50Reagan Jr., J.W. Hubbert M.L. Shelness G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38104-38110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), which could further exacerbate the accumulation of lysosomal cholesterol and inhibit cholesterol efflux.The findings in this study raise additional questions related to lipoprotein abnormalities and atherosclerotic risk in humans with ASM deficiency (types A and B Niemann-Pick disease). These subjects have markedly low plasma HDL levels (19Viana M.B. Giugliani R. Leite V.H. Barth M.L. Lekhwani C. Slade C.M. Fensom A. J. Med. Genet. 1990; 27: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 20Worgall T.S. McGovern M.M. Jiang X.C. Berglund L. Shea S. Tabas I. Deckelbaum R.J. Circulation. 2001; 102: II-30Google Scholar). Given that low plasma HDL can result from defective cellular cholesterol efflux (21Tall A.R. Wang N. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1205-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), our current data may provide a mechanism that contributes to this lipoprotein abnormality. Regarding atherosclerotic risk, one must focus on type B Niemann-Pick patients, who survive to adulthood due to low levels of residual ASM activity, and type A or type B obligate heterozygotes, who are reported to be “normal” (16Schuchman E.H. Desnick R.J. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2601-2624Google Scholar). In considering the potential atherogenic effects of L-SMase deficiency in these subjects, it is interesting to consider that the ASM gene also gives rise to secretory SMase (57Tabas I. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 102: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Because secretory SMase promotes the subendothelial aggregation and retention of lipoproteins, leading to enhanced foam cell formation, S-SMase deficiency, unlike L-SMase deficiency, may decrease cholesterol accumulation in lesional macrophages (57Tabas I. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 102: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Therefore, while the deficiency of S-SMase in these subjects might be protective, defective L-SMase activity, by inhibiting cholesterol efflux from lesional macrophages and possibly by leading to low HDL levels, may promote atherosclerotic vascular disease. Cholesteryl ester (CE)1-loaded macrophages, or foam cells, are prominent features of atherosclerotic lesions and play important roles in lesion progression (1Ross R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 791-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar, 2Libby P. Clinton S.K. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1993; 4: 355-363Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). During atherogenesis, intimal macrophages internalize atherogenic lipoproteins, including modified forms of LDL, that have been retained in the arterial subendothelium (1Ross R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 791-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar, 3Tabas I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 4Williams K.J. Tabas I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 551-561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This event directly leads to esterification of cellular cholesterol by acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterolO-acyltransferase (ACAT), resulting in “foam cell” formation (3Tabas I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 5Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 223-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Foam cell formation can be prevented or reversed by the process known as cellular cholesterol efflux (6Tall A.R. Eur. Heart J. 1998; 19: A31-A35PubMed Google Scholar). Cholesterol efflux is the initial step of reverse cholesterol transport, a process whereby excess cholesterol in peripheral cells is delivered to the liver for excretion (6Tall A.R. Eur. Heart J. 1998; 19: A31-A35PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the elucidation of cellular molecules and pathways that facilitate and regulate cholesterol efflux is a major goal of research in the area of atherosclerosis. Atherogenic lipoproteins internalized by macrophages deliver their stores of cholesterol, which are mostly in the form of CE, to late endosomes and/or lysosomes (3Tabas I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Here, lysosomal acid lipase hydrolyzes the CE to free cholesterol, which is then transported by poorly defined mechanisms to various sites in the cell (3Tabas I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A major site of transport is the plasma membrane, and from there the cholesterol can be effluxed to extracellular acceptors, such as apoA-I and HDL, or transported to ACAT in the endoplasmic reticulum for re-esterification (3Tabas I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 6Tall A.R. Eur. Heart J. 1998; 19: A31-A35PubMed Google Scholar). Efflux to apoA-I involves the initial formation of phospholipid-apoA-I particles by ABCA1-mediated phospholipid efflux, followed by cholesterol efflux to these phospholipid-rich particles (7Wang N. Silver D.L. Thiele C. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23742-23747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 8Fielding P.E. Nagao K. Hakamata H. Chimini G. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14113-14120Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Cholesterol efflux to HDL can be mediated by scavenger receptor type B1 (SR-B1) in those cell types that have relatively high levels of this receptor, such as human monocyte-derived macrophages, but another mechanism must be involved in cells that have very low expression of SR-B1, such as mouse peritoneal macrophages 2Y. Sun and A. R. Tall, unpublished data.2Y. Sun and A. R. Tall, unpublished data. (6Tall A.R. Eur. Heart J. 1998; 19: A31-A35PubMed Google Scholar, 9Ji Y. Jian B. Wang N. Sun Y. Moya M.L. Phillips M.C.

Phillips M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 781-796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given that all pathways of cholesterol efflux require cholesterol transport to the plasma membrane, the identification of molecules mediating or regulating this transport process is an important goal. Thus far, only the molecules npc1, npc2 (HE1), and possibly lysobisphosphatidic acid have been shown to play a role in cholesterol transport to the plasma membrane, and the molecular mechanisms are poorly understood (11Liscum L. Klansek J.J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 12Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Biochim. Biophys.

Sakuraba H. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). We reasoned that another molecule, lysosomal sphingomyelinase (L-SMase), may also be involved in cholesterol transport from lysosomes to the plasma membrane. L-SMase, a product of the acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) gene, hydrolyzes sphingomyelin in late endosomes and lysosomes (16Schuchman E.H. Desnick R.J. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D.

Mounting evidence suggests that for AGC kinase family members, a single kinase, the phosphoinositide-dependent kinase, PDK-1,1 assumes this role (1Toker A. Newton A. Cell. 2000; 103: 185-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar,2Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). Originally discovered as the upstream kinase for Akt/protein kinase B (3Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PDK-1 is now known to phosphorylate many other kinases, including PKC, p70S6 kinase, ribosomal S6 kinase, p21-activated kinase, PKC-related kinase, and serum glucocorticoid kinase (1Toker A.

The ability to regulate the function of multiple protein kinases places PDK-1 at a pivotal point in cellular signaling. Thus, understanding how the cellular function of PDK-1 is regulated is a central question in signal transduction. Signaling by PKC has been intensely studied in the past 2 decades, spawned by the seminal discovery of Nishizuka and co-workers (5Nishizuka Y. Science. 1986; 233: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4038) Google Scholar) that this member of the kinase superfamily transduces the myriad of signals that promote phospholipid hydrolysis. Yet the fact that all family members depend on a series of ordered phosphorylation events before they are competent to respond to lipid second messengers has only recently been appreciated (6Dutil E.M. Keranen L.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29359-29362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). The discovery that PKC isozymes are processed by phosphorylation at three conserved positions (8Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 9Tsutakawa S.E. Medzihradszky K.F. Flint A.J. Burlingame A.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26807-26812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) led to a search for an upstream kinase. This search culminated in the finding that PDK-1, discovered in 1997 as the upstream kinase for the close cousin of PKC, Akt/protein kinase B, is the activation loop kinase for conventional (10Dutil E.M. Toker A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1366-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), novel, and atypical PKCs (11Chou M.M. Hou W. Johnson J. Graham L.K. Lee M.H.

Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). Thus, PKC is regulated by two mechanisms, phosphorylation and cofactors. Protein kinase C isozymes consist of a single polypeptide with the carboxyl-terminal moiety containing the kinase core and the amino-terminal moiety containing one (C1) or two (C1 and C2) membrane-targeting modules coupled to an autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate sequence. The dogma for regulation of PKC is that generation of diacylglycerol engages the C1 domain on membranes, an interaction that is facilitated by Ca2+-triggered binding of the C2 domain for some isozymes (13Newton A.C. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2353-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). This membrane interaction provides the energy to release the autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate sequence from the substrate-binding cavity, resulting in substrate phosphorylation and downstream signaling. There are three classes of PKC isozymes: conventional isozymes (α, βI, βII, and γ) have a C1 and C2 domain and are regulated by diacylglycerol and Ca2+; novel isozymes (δ, ε, and η/L) have a C1 domain and a “novel” C2 domain and are regulated by diacylglycerol but not Ca2+; and atypical isozymes (ζ, ι/λ) contain an “atypical” C1 domain that is not competent to bind diacylglycerol so that the function of atypical PKCs is not regulated by the classical ligands Ca2+ and diacylglycerol. The kinase domain contains three conserved phosphorylation sites: the activation loop (Thr-500 in PKC βII) which is phosphorylated by PDK-1, and two carboxyl-terminal sites, the turn and hydrophobic motif (Thr-641 and Ser-660, respectively, in PKC βII), which are regulated by autophosphorylation in conventional PKCs (14Behn-Krappa A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 728-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). These sites are conserved in all isozymes except for atypical PKCs, which contain a phospho-mimic, Glu, at the phospho-acceptor position of the hydrophobic motif. Phosphate at the activation loop unmasks the substrate-binding cavity and structures the enzyme for catalysis, with phosphates at the two carboxyl-terminal positions then locking the enzyme in this catalytically competent conformation. The fully phosphorylated species is the mature form that is competent to respond to lipid second messengers. The regulation of PKC by PDK-1 begs the question as to whether PKC isozymes are under the coordinated regulation of two lipid signaling pathways: the PI3-kinase pathway that would control the maturation of PKC, and the phospholipase pathway that allosterically controls the activity of the mature enzyme. PDK-1 contains a PH domain, and binding studies suggest it has a high intrinsic affinity for 3′-phosphoinositides (3Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P.

Nonetheless, in vitroanalyses reveal that PDK-1 has a high basal activity in the absence of any cofactors, with the phosphorylation of substrates such as PKC being unaffected by the presence of phosphoinositides (10Dutil E.M. Toker A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1366-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). One possibility is that PDK-1 is constitutively active in cells, with specificity in signaling by PDK-1 dictated by the conformation of its substrates (1Toker A. Newton A. Cell. 2000; 103: 185-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Thus, particular signals would target downstream kinases for phosphorylation by PDK-1 by altering their conformation or subcellular location for recognition by PDK-1. Indeed, PDK-1 holds its name because of the dependence on phosphoinositides for its first-discovered substrate, Akt/protein kinase B, to unmask the PDK-1 phosphorylation site (3Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, generation of 3′-phosphoinositides recruits Akt to the membrane by its PH domain, an event that unmasks the activation loop. Deletion of the PH domain or forced recruitment of Akt to membranes by addition of other membrane-targeting modules results in constitutive phosphorylation of Akt (17Andjelkovic M. Alessi D.R. Meier R. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Frech M. Cron P. Cohen P. Lucocq J.M. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol.

Biol. 2000; 20: 5712-5721Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The conformation of PKC is also critical for phosphorylation by PDK-1; the pseudosubstrate must be removed from the active site in order for PDK-1 to access the activation loop (20Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10697-10701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether the intrinsic activity of PDK-1 is regulated in vivo. This study examines the subcellular location, mechanism, and regulation of the phosphorylation of conventional PKCs by PDK-1. Pulse-chase experiments reveal that newly synthesized endogenous PKC α is phosphorylated by PDK-1 in a membrane fraction. Studies with wild-type and phosphorylation site mutants of PKC α or βII reveal that this phosphorylation is the first step in the processing of PKC, is under negative regulation by the PH domain of PDK-1, and is independent of PI3-kinase activity.

Wortmannin and LY294002 were purchased from Calbiochem. All other chemicals were reagent-grade. For experiments involving separation of the cytosol and membrane fractions, COS-7 cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 300 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 μmbenzamidine, 40 μg ml−1 leupeptin, and 100 nm microcystin) and subjected to sonication (Branson bath sonicator). Whole cell lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant (cytosol) was removed. The pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C; the resulting supernatant comprised the detergent-soluble membrane fraction. The Triton X-100-insoluble pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer containing 0.5% SDS, briefly probe-sonicated, and the SDS-soluble fraction separated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. For some experiments, cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to yield a Triton X-100-soluble supernatant containing cytosolic and detergent-soluble membrane proteins. COS-7 cells were plated to 50% confluency in 6-well dishes 1 day before transfection. Unless otherwise indicated, cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum.

Untransfected COS-7 cells were used to study the endogenous PKC α. Approximately 24–30 h post-transfection, cells were incubated with methionine/cysteine-deficient DMEM for 15 min at 37 °C. The cells were then pulse-labeled with 0.5 mCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine in methionine/cysteine-deficient DMEM for 7 min at 37 °C and chased in chase media (DMEM containing 5 mm unlabeled methionine and 5 mm unlabeled cysteine) for 0–60 min as indicated in the specific experiments. At the times indicated in the figure legends, cells were harvested, lysed, and fractionated as described above. For experiments in which PI3-kinase was inhibited, NIH 3T3 cells were used; these were transfected using Effectene Transfection reagents (Qiagen). Following transfection, one-half of the transfected cells was incubated in serum-free DMEM overnight, whereas the other half of the cells was kept in serum-containing growth media (DMEM + 10% calf serum). Approximately 30 h post-transfection, serum-starved cells were treated with wortmannin (100 nm) and LY290004 (30 μm) for 20 min at 37 °C. The cells were then labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine and chased for 0–90 min as indicated in the specific experiments. All constructs of PKC α and βII were immunoprecipitated with an anti-PKC α monoclonal antibody that recognizes both α and βII isozymes (Transduction Laboratories). An anti-Myc antibody and an anti-HA antibody were used to immunoprecipitate the Myc-tagged PKC ζ and the HA-tagged Akt, respectively. COS-7 or NIH 3T3 cell lysates were immunoprecipitated in the presence of 100 μl of protein A/G-agarose and 1 μl of specific antibodies for 16 h at 4 °C. Agarose beads were washed 3 times with 300 μl of lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and twice with 300 μl of 0.5 m NaCl. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon. The35S signals were obtained by exposing Immobilon membranes to a Bio-Rad molecular imaging screen for 72 h, and PKC (or Akt) was detected by Western blot analysis using chemiluminescence. Relative radioactivity and chemiluminescence were quantified by analysis using a Molecular Imager System (Bio-Rad) or by a CCD camera using a GeneGnome bioimaging system (Syngene), respectively. To determine where in the cell newly synthesized PKC is phosphorylated, we employed a pulse-chase analysis that took advantage of the mobility shift accompanying phosphorylation of PKC (6Dutil E.M. Keranen L.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29359-29362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Specifically, we asked the following question: in which cellular fraction does the faster migrating, unphosphorylated species of PKC partition? To ensure that we were examining the physiologically relevant location, initial studies probed the PKC α endogenous to COS-7 cells. Cells were incubated with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 7 min to label a discrete population of newly synthesized protein. This population was then chased by incubation of cells with unlabeled methionine/cysteine for various times. Cells were lysed in the absence of detergent and fractionated into a cytosolic and particulate fraction. The particulate fraction was then extracted with Triton X-100 to yield a detergent-soluble membrane fraction, and the phosphorylation of PKC in each fraction was monitored by examining the electrophoretic mobility of immunoprecipitated kinase on SDS-PAGE. The autoradiogram in Fig. 1 (top panel) shows that 35S-labeled PKC was present in both the membrane and cytosolic fractions. No PKC was present in the detergent-insoluble fraction (not shown). Immediately following the pulse of [35S]methionine/cysteine, PKC migrated as two major bands in the membrane fraction (lane 1). Previous mass spectrometric analysis has revealed that the faster migrating band (dash) corresponds to unphosphorylated protein; a barely detectable intermediate band (asterisk) corresponds to protein phosphorylated at the activation loop and carboxyl-terminal turn motif, and the slowest migrating band (double asterisk) corresponds to protein phosphorylated at all three “maturation” positions: the activation loop, turn motif, and hydrophobic motif (8Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). There were comparable amounts of upper and lower bands immediately following the 7-min chase, indicating that the fastest migrating band was chased to the slower migrating band with a half-time on this order. This shift resulted from phosphorylation; treatment of sample enriched in the slower migrating species with protein phosphatase 1, which dephosphorylates all three in vivo phosphorylation sites (8Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), caused the enzyme to migrate as a single, faster migrating species (data not shown). Newly synthesized unphosphorylated PKC localized exclusively to the membrane fraction; even at the earliest chase time (lane 5), there was no detectable faster-migrating band in the cytosolic fraction. Rather, phosphorylated PKC accumulated in the cytosol. Western blot analysis to probe for the total pool of PKC revealed that ∼70% of the PKC was present in the cytosolic fraction and ∼30% in the membrane fraction under the conditions of these experiments (Fig. 1, lower panel). Note that only the mature form (indicated with double asterisk) was detected by Western blot analysis, revealing that >95% of the bulk PKC α in COS-7 cells is fully processed under standard cell culture conditions (i.e. with serum, so that PI3-K is activated, but in the absence of phospholipase C activators). These data reveal that the physiologically relevant location for processing of endogenous PKC α is at a membrane fraction. Following phosphorylation, the majority of the PKC is released to the cytosol. Overexpression of PKC often results in localization of unphosphorylated species in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction (e.g. Ref. 22Edwards A.S. Faux M.C. Scott J.D. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6461-6468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus, we asked whether overexpressed PKC α was processed in the same way as endogenous PKC α or whether newly synthesized enzyme accumulated in the detergent-insoluble fraction. COS-7 cells transfected with the cDNA for PKC α were subjected to pulse-chase analysis, lysed in the presence of Triton X-100, and separated into Triton X-100-soluble (i.e. cytosol plus membrane) and -insoluble (i.e.cytoskeletal) fractions. The insoluble fraction was further solubilized with SDS to yield an SDS-soluble fraction. Under the conditions of our experiments, PKC was overexpressed ∼10-fold relative to the endogenous PKC. The autoradiogram in Fig.2 A shows that newly synthesized PKC localized to the Triton X-100-soluble fraction, with no detectable 35S-labeled protein in the SDS-soluble fraction. This species migrated as a 78-kDa band at the first time point (immediately following the chase; lane 5) and shifted to a slower migrating species with a half-time between 15 (lane 6) and 30 (lane 7) min. The 35S-labeled pool of PKC was almost completely phosphorylated following 45 min of chase (lane 8). Western blot analysis revealed that the Triton X-100-soluble fraction contained only the slower mobility, phosphorylated species of PKC, consistent with previous results (8Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). In summary, these pulse-chase data show that the SDS-soluble fraction is devoid of any newly synthesized PKC; rather, recombinant PKC α is processed to a fully phosphorylated species in a Triton X-100-soluble fraction. Studies with PKC βII revealed similar results; recombinant enzyme was processed exclusively in the detergent-soluble fraction (note that this isozyme was processed with a slightly longer half-time of around 60 min (e.g. Fig. 5)).Figure 5Phosphorylation of the activation loop is the rate-limiting step in the maturation of conventional PKC.A, autoradiograms of 35S-labeled PKC βII from COS-7 cells transfected with wild-type PKC βII (top panel, WT), S660E mutant (middle panel), and S660A mutant (bottom panel).

Lines shown are a least squares fit for the data obtained for the two mutants.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Analysis of the newly synthesized recombinant PKC α in the membrane and cytosolic fractions revealed that the processing of exogenous kinase differed from that of endogenous kinase in two ways. First, newly synthesized unphosphorylated PKC was present in both the membrane (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1–4) and cytosolic (Fig. 2 B, lanes 5–8) fractions (in contrast to just the membrane fraction for exogenous protein). Second, newly synthesized phosphorylated protein was not detected in the membrane fraction but partitioned exclusively in the cytosolic fraction (in contrast to both fractions for endogenous protein). One possibility for these differences is that potential docking sites at the membrane for newly synthesized PKC are saturated in the overexpression studies, so that excess newly synthesized enzyme accumulates in the cytosol. Once the membrane-associated population is phosphorylated and released into the cytosol, the excess enzyme could bind the membrane and be processed. Alternatively, this mislocalized enzyme could be phosphorylated in the cytosol; although we were unable to detect endogenous PDK-1 with our antibodies, the bulk of recombinant PDK-1 localizes to the cytosol under our cell culture conditions. Western blot analysis revealed that the majority (85%) of the mature, phosphorylated species of PKC was present in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 2 B, lower panel) suggesting that once phosphorylated, PKC accumulates in the cytosol. We next explored whether the membrane localization of PDK-1 was necessary for efficient phosphorylation of PKC. To this end, we examined the rate of processing of PKC by a construct of PDK-1 deleted in its membrane-targeting module, the PH domain. Pulse-chase experiments were performed on COS-7 cells transfected with PKC βII and either wild-type PDK-1 or a construct in which the PH domain had been deleted. Confocal microscopy confirmed that the deletion mutant did not associate with the plasma membrane of stimulated NIH 3T3 cells (data not shown). Co-expression of the wild-type PDK-1 (Fig. 3, middle panel) resulted in a modest acceleration of PKC maturation relative to the rate of maturation in cells containing only endogenous PDK-1 (upper panel). This suggests that endogenous PDK-1 is unlikely to be limiting for the processing of PKC and, indeed, that higher levels of PDK-1 are inhibitory. Fig. 3, lower panel,shows that deletion of the PH domain resulted in an increase in the rate of processing of PKC. Specifically, in cells co-transfected with wild-type PDK-1, ∼40% of the PKC migrated as the fully phosphorylated form following 60 min of chase. In contrast, in cells co-transfected with the construct of PDK-1 lacking the PH domain, ∼40% of the PKC migrated as the fully phosphorylated form following 15 min of chase. Thus, the PH domain is not required for the phosphorylation of PKC. In fact, the PH domain has an autoinhibitory function; removal of the domain increases the rate of processing of PKC. It remains to be determined whether this increased rate of processing occurs at the membrane or cytosol. Mutation of the activation loop phosphorylation sites to non-phosphorylatable, neutral residues results in expression of PKC that is not phosphorylated and cannot be activated (20Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10697-10701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 24Orr J.W. Newton A.C. J. Biol.

To determine whether phosphorylation by PDK-1 is a required first step in the maturation of PKC, or whether such constructs are processed by phosphorylation but then become rapidly dephosphorylated, we examined the processing of activation loop mutants by pulse-chase analysis. COS-7 cells were transfected with a mutant in which the activation loop threonine as well as two flanking threonines (497 and 498) had been mutated to Ala (referred to as T500AAA) 2Note that pulse-chase analysis of the PKC mutant T500V resulted in a small fraction of PKC migrating at the slower mobility, indicating some compensatory phosphorylation of residues neighboring Thr-500 (data not shown), as has been reported for PKC α (25Cazaubon S. Bornancin F. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar); this compensating phosphorylation was prevented in the triple mutant, T500AAA. and subjected to pulse-chase analysis.

Using the technologically important hard transition metal carbides as prototypes, although the principle is transferable also to other systems, we demonstrate, from first-principles calculations, that by suitable alloying the energy difference between several competing structures in the transition metal carbides is small or tunable. This creates multiphase/polytypic compounds with a random or controllable layer stacking sequence, systems in which the propagation of dislocations can be strongly suppressed by a large number of interfaces between structures with different glide systems, accordingly allowing the possibility of a greatly enhanced hardness. With modern thin-film technologies, it should therefore be possible to deposit such materials that will express multilayer characteristics with only minor changes in the chemical constitution of the material, which is in contrast to conventional superlattices."

Cytoskeletal rearrangements have not been directly observed, but these structures seem to be required, since various cytoskeletal chemical modulators hamper the internalization of Brucella in these cells (7Pizarro-Cerdá J.

Although the molecular mechanisms underlying these phenomena are not known, at least one signaling system, BvrR-BvrS, coding for a regulator (BvrR) and a sensor protein (BvrS) has been implicated in the invasion of Brucella abortus into cells (14Sola-Landa A.

In the same vein, the absence of O- and native hapten polysaccharides on the Brucella surface considerably hampers bacterial cell invasion (14Sola-Landa A. Pizarro-Cerdá J. Grillo M.J. Moreno E.

The ability of different bacteria to exploit cell signal transduction pathways and cytoskeletal components to secure their survival is a well recognized event. Paradigms of host subversion by either intracellular or extracellular bacteria such as Salmonella,Shigella, Listeria, Neisseria,Yersinia, and Escherichia have been established in recent years (25Jerse A.E.

By interacting with cytoskeletal regulators such as the small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho subfamily, these bacteria have developed efficient ways to induce cytoskeletal rearrangements. GTPases of the Rho subfamily function as molecular switches that cycle between an active GTP-bound state and an inactive GDP-bound state. Activated proteins of the Rho subfamily interact with effector molecules to produce biological responses involving actin reorganization. Some of these responses involve membrane rearrangements implicated in several functions, one of them being phagocytosis (32Bar-Sagi D. Hall A. Cell. 2000; 103: 227-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To characterize the basic molecular events that proceed after B. abortus binds to nonprofessional phagocytic HeLa cells, several microscopic and biological strategies were followed. Initially, we employed cytoskeletal chemical modulators in cells previous to infection. Then, we used bacterial toxins capable of modifying small GTPases of the Rho family as well as expression of dominant-positive or dominant-negative GTPase forms in cells during bacterial infection. Finally, we performed direct quantification of activated small GTPases after infection with B. abortus. The data obtained indicate that B. abortus modulates the host cell cytoskeleton to induce its internalization. All strains were routinely grown in tryptic soy or Luria-Bertani medium. B. abortus2308 NaIr is a wild-type virulent smooth lipopolysaccharide strain that has been described elsewhere (33Sangari F. Agüero J. Microb.

Cells were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 2.5% sodium bicarbonate, and 1% glutamine. Penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml), which were routinely added, were excluded from cell cultures during Brucellainfections. For cell microinjection, 5 × 105 HeLa cells were seeded on 13-mm glass slides and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were microinjected (FemtoJet®, Eppendorf) into the nucleus with the selected plasmids at a concentration of 1 μg/ml in sterile distilled water and infected with B. abortus as described below. After a 16-h incubation in the presence of 5 μg/ml gentamycin, cells were processed for immunofluorescence. Successfully injected cells and intracellular bacteria were localized by immunofluorescence using an anti-Myc antibody (clone 9E-10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), a TRITC-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Sigma), and a bovine FITC-conjugated anti-Brucella antibody (39Rojas N.

Unless otherwise stated, the toxin working concentrations and incubation times used were as follows: 50 ng/ml TcdB-10463 for 40 min, 50 ng/ml TcdB-1470 for 40 min, 5 ng/ml TcdA overnight, 1 μg/ml TcsL-1522 overnight, and 3 ng/ml CNF for 2 h. Intoxication of HeLa cells was always carried out prior to B. abortus infection. After intoxication, the monolayer was washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline (0.01 m, pH 7.4) and kept at 4 °C until infection. Infections were carried out using an overnight culture of B. abortus diluted in Eagle's minimal essential medium to reach a concentration of 2.5 × 108 cfu/ml. The inoculum was then added to the monolayer at a multiplicity of infection of 500 cfu/ml. For Salmonella control experiments, the multiplicity of infection was 50 cfu/ml. Plates were centrifuged at 300 × g at 4 °C, incubated for 30 min at 37 °C under 5% CO2, and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. Extracellular bacteria were killed by adding Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml gentamycin for 1 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Plates were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline. HeLa cells were lysed by adding 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. The samples were collected, spun, and resuspended in 110 μl of tryptic soy broth. Aliquots were plated on tryptic soy agar and incubated at 37 °C for 3 days for determination of cfu.Table IComparative inhibition pattern of entry for Listeria and SalmonellaDrugTargetEffect on ListeriainternalizationEffect on Salmonella internalizationColchicineMicrotubulesInhibition in macrophages, but not in HT-29 or Caco-2 enterocytes (99Kuhn M.

Open table in a new tab For immunofluorescence analysis, HeLa cells (5 × 105) were seeded on 13-mm glass slides, incubated until subconfluent at 37 °C under 5% CO2, and inoculated with bacteria as described above. After five washing steps with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were fixed with ice-cold 3% paraformaldehyde (Merck) for 15 min. Samples were washed once and incubated for 10 min with phosphate-buffered saline containing 50 mmNH4Cl. Intracellular and extracellular bacteria were detected and counted as previously described (11Pizarro-Cerdá J. Moreno E. Sanguedolce V. Mege J.L. Gorvel J.-P. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 2387-2392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, extracellular bacteria were labeled using a FITC-conjugated anti-Brucella antibody diluted 1:250 (in 10% horse serum in phosphate-buffered saline), followed by washing steps. Intracellular bacteria were detected by incubating the slides for 30 min with rabbit anti-B. abortus antiserum (39Rojas N. Freer E. Weintraub A. Ramı́rez M. Lind S. Moreno E. Clin. Diagn. Lab.

The cells were then washed three times with 0.2% Tween 20 and incubated for 30 min with a TRITC-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) diluted 1:150 in 10% horse serum containing 0.1% saponin. When needed, FITC-phalloidin (Sigma) was added at this point. Slides were mounted in Mowiol solution and analyzed by phase-contrast or fluorescence microscopy. Counts of intracellular and extracellular bacteria were performed in at least 100 infected cells and are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of bacteria/cell. The percentage of cells with associated bacteria is expressed as the mean ± S.D. of cells with bound bacteria in five different 40× fields. Statistical analysis was performed using Student'st test. For transmission electron microscopy, HeLa monolayers infected with an overnight culture of B. abortus2308 NaIr were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer. Samples were placed in 1% OsO4 solution for 1 h for post-fixation, dehydrated in a graded concentration of ethanol, and infiltrated with Spurr resin. Thin sections on 300 mesh collodion-coated grids were stained with uranyl acetate and lead Sato's solution (46Robinson D.G. Ehlers U. Herken R. Hermann B. Mayer F. Schurmann F.W. Methods of Preparation for Electron Microscopy. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1987: 69-71Google Scholar). Preparations were examined with a Hitachi H-7100 electron microscope operating at 75 kV. For precipitation steps, GST-tagged RBD and PBD were purified from cell lysates of E. coli strains harboring plasmids pGEX-2T-TRBD and pGEX-2T-PBD, respectively, according to Ren et al. (37Ren X.D.

Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 1 min. Twenty μl of lysate were saved as a control of total GTPase content. GTP-loaded Rho GTPases were precipitated with Sepharose beads coupled to either GST-PBD or GST-RBD protein. Samples were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with shaking, washed with precipitation buffer, and resuspended in 25 μl of sample buffer for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis (47Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Sco"
https://openalex.org/W2007522168,"DNA degradation during apoptotic execution generally occurs at two levels: early as high molecular weight (HMW) fragments and later on as oligonucleosomal fragments. Two nucleases, CAD/CPAN/DFF40 and endonuclease G, can digest nuclear chromatin to produce the oligonucleosomal fragments, and it has been suggested that CAD might be responsible for HMW DNA cleavage. To more clearly define the role of CAD in nuclear disassembly, we have generatedCAD −/− sublines of chicken DT40 cells in which the entire CAD open reading frame has been deleted. These cells grow normally and undergo apoptosis with kinetics essentially identical to wild type cells. However, they fail to undergo detectable oligonucleosomal fragmentation, proving that CAD is essential for this stage of DNA cleavage, at least in DT40 cells. Other aspects of nuclear disassembly, including HMW DNA cleavage and early stage apoptotic chromatin condensation against the nuclear periphery proceed normally in the absence of CAD. However, the final stages of chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation do not occur. Our results demonstrate that CAD is required for complete disassembly of the nucleus during apoptosis and reveal the existence of one or more as yet unidentified second factors responsible for HMW DNA cleavage and the early stages of apoptotic chromatin condensation. DNA degradation during apoptotic execution generally occurs at two levels: early as high molecular weight (HMW) fragments and later on as oligonucleosomal fragments. Two nucleases, CAD/CPAN/DFF40 and endonuclease G, can digest nuclear chromatin to produce the oligonucleosomal fragments, and it has been suggested that CAD might be responsible for HMW DNA cleavage. To more clearly define the role of CAD in nuclear disassembly, we have generatedCAD −/− sublines of chicken DT40 cells in which the entire CAD open reading frame has been deleted. These cells grow normally and undergo apoptosis with kinetics essentially identical to wild type cells. However, they fail to undergo detectable oligonucleosomal fragmentation, proving that CAD is essential for this stage of DNA cleavage, at least in DT40 cells. Other aspects of nuclear disassembly, including HMW DNA cleavage and early stage apoptotic chromatin condensation against the nuclear periphery proceed normally in the absence of CAD. However, the final stages of chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation do not occur. Our results demonstrate that CAD is required for complete disassembly of the nucleus during apoptosis and reveal the existence of one or more as yet unidentified second factors responsible for HMW DNA cleavage and the early stages of apoptotic chromatin condensation. high molecular weight DNA fragmentation factor caspase-activated DNase inhibitor of CAD base pair(s) kilobase(s) kilobase pair(s) expressed sequence tag terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenyl-indole DNA degradation was the first biochemical hallmark of apoptotic execution to be identified (1Wyllie A.H. Nature. 1980; 284: 555-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (4129) Google Scholar). In most cells two stages of DNA degradation are observed (1Wyllie A.H. Nature. 1980; 284: 555-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (4129) Google Scholar, 2Cohen J.J. Duke R.C. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 38-42PubMed Google Scholar). Early in the process, the DNA is cleaved to high molecular weight (HMW)1 fragments that may be indicative of a large scale domain organization of the chromatin (3Filipski J. Leblanc J. Youdale T. Sikorska M. Walker P.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1319-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Later on, in most cell types the chromatin is cut into shorter fragments, referred to here as oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation (1Wyllie A.H. Nature. 1980; 284: 555-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (4129) Google Scholar). Importantly, some cell lines exhibit only HMW DNA cleavage (4Ucker D.S. Obermiller P.S. Eckhart W. Apgar J.R. Berger N.A.

To date, the best characterized nuclease with a clearly demonstrated role in cell death in vertebrates is CAD/CPAN/DFF40 (6Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar, 7Halenbeck R. MacDonald H. Roulston A. Chen T.T. Conroy L. Williams L.T. Curr.

A. 1998; 95: 8461-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). This 40-kDa polypeptide was first isolated from cytoplasm of healthy cells together with a second polypeptide of 45-kDa as part of a complex called DFF (DNA fragmentation factor) (9Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar). The 40-kDa subunit was subsequently purified in an independent study (6Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar), shown to have nuclease activity, and renamed CAD (caspase-activated DNase). DFF45/ICAD is both a folding chaperone and enzymatic inhibitor of CAD. If CAD is translated in the absence of ICAD, it adopts an inactive conformation and is catalytically inert (6Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar). If CAD is translated in the presence of ICAD, it adopts an active conformation but is catalytically inactive due to the binding of the ICAD inhibitor. Upon the induction of apoptosis, ICAD/DFF45 is cleaved in two places by caspase-3 or similar caspases, thereby releasing active CAD (9Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar, 10Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar). Studies with purified cloned CAD have shown that CAD alone is sufficient to induce both DNA fragmentation and complete apoptotic chromatin condensation in isolated nuclei (8Liu X. Li P. Widlak P.

CAD was initially isolated from cytosolic fractions (6Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar, 9Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar); however, it was subsequently shown that both CAD and ICAD are nuclear in healthy cells (8Liu X. Li P.

It now appears likely that the CAD·ICAD complex leaks out of nuclei during subcellular fractionation. A second nuclease recently shown to be active in apoptosis is endonuclease G. This enzyme normally resides in mitochondria, and its translocation to the nucleus during apoptosis can lead to oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation (15Li L.Y. Luo X. Wang X. Nature. 2001; 412: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar, 16Parrish J. Li L. Klotz K. Ledwich D. Wang X. Xue D. Nature. 2001; 412: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The relative contributions of CAD and endonuclease G to apoptotic DNA processing are only now being elucidated. Studies of the DFF45/ICAD knockout mouse showed that apoptotic cells had a significant reduction both in the level of oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation and in the level of apoptotic chromatin condensation (17Zhang J. Liu X. Scherer D.C. van Kaer L. Wang X. Xu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12480-12485Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This could be explained if CAD were inactive as a result of the loss of its folding chaperone. Overexpression of caspase-resistant ICAD in cells also resulted in a suppression of DNA cleavage during apoptosis, presumably because the ICAD remained bound to CAD despite the presence of active caspases (18Sakahira H. Enari M. Ohsawa Y. Uchiyama Y. Nagata S. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 543-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in both of these studies, the HMW cleavage was also suppressed, suggesting that CAD itself might be responsible for both stages of cleavage (18Sakahira H. Enari M. Ohsawa Y. Uchiyama Y. Nagata S. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 543-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 19Zhang J. Lee H. Lou D.W. Bovin G.P. Xu M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It remains possible that the phenotypes seen with theICAD/DFF45 knockout and overexpression of uncleavable ICAD arose not due to the lack of CAD activity but as a reflection of an as yet unknown function of ICAD (11Samejima K. Toné S. Kottke T.J. Enari M. Sakahira H. Cooke C.A. Durrieu F. Martins L.M. Nagata S. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To clarify this issue, we have generated sublines of chicken DT40 cells in which the entireCAD open reading frame has been deleted. Our results reveal that CAD is essential for oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation in apoptosis but that another nuclease (or nucleases) is responsible for HMW cleavage. Furthermore, differences between the phenotypes observed following elimination of CAD and those observed following the elimination of ICAD or expression of uncleavable ICAD mutants raise the possibility that ICAD may do more than simply regulate CAD activity. Plaques of lamdaFiX II carrying a genomic DNA fragment from DT 40 cells were screened with a 532-bp DNA fragment fromCAD EST (dfkz426_18p13r1). The phage DNA insert (G3B: 18 kb), which contains chicken CAD genomic DNA, was totally sequenced by GATC Biotech AG (Germany). 5′- and 3′-flanking regions of 1.8 and 3 kb were amplified from the phage DNA using oligo pairs aagcggccgcctctctgattg/atcactagtagctgcgcctgc and ataggatccgctctctttggaagcagcttc/ttactcgagaactgctggagatgtgggagg and ligated into NotI-SpeI andBamHI-XhoI sites of pBluescript (Stratagene), respectively. Resistance cassettes (puromycin or blasticidin) were inserted into the BamHI site. 5′- and 3′-probes for Southern hybridization (497 and 509 bp) were amplified from phage G3B DNA using gaccacaactcaacttac/ggtgagtctgacagctct and aatgtcaaaggcagactc/ttcacacaaagcagctgg, respectively. Targeting vectors were linearized by KpnI (puromycin) or NotI (blasticidin). 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends was performed following the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.) to obtain the N terminus of CAD(71 amino acids) missing from CAD EST (udel.pat.pk0033b9.f). The GenBankTM accession number for the cCAD gene isAF406761. 1.5 × 107 DT40 cells (grown in RPMI media plus 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% chicken serum, penicillin, and streptomycin) were suspended into 0.5 ml of Optimem per cuvette (Bio-Rad 0.4 mm). 20 μg of linearized DNA was added to each cuvette and kept on ice for 5 min before and after electroporation (300 V; 950 microfarads in a GenePulser, Bio-Rad). After 24 h, cells were transferred to 96-well plates containing selective media (puromycin at 0.5 μg/ml or blasticidin at 25 μg/ml, Calbiochem). Cells were labeled with either a TUNEL-fluoros staining kit or an annexin V-fluoros staining kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following the manufacturer's instructions. Microscopy was done as described previously (11Samejima K. Toné S. Kottke T.J. Enari M. Sakahira H. Cooke C.A. Durrieu F. Martins L.M. Nagata S. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with either 50 μm etoposide (Calbiochem) for 3.5 h or 25 nm staurosporine for 16 h, and extracts were prepared as described previously (20Wood E.R. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2839-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of each extract measured by the Bradford assay ranged from 9.3 to 15.6 mg/ml. Active caspases in extracts were labeled with Z-EK(bio)d-aomk as described previously (21Martins L.M. Kottke T. Mesner P.W. Basi G.S. Sinha S. Frigon N.J. Tatar E. Tung J.S. Bryant K. Takahashi A.

Nuclei of HeLa S3 or DT40 cells were prepared and incubated for 3 h as described previously (20Wood E.R. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2839-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 26Lazebnik Y.A. Cole S. Cooke C.A. Nelson W.G. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 7-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) with the only difference being that DT40 cells were lysed with five Dounce strokes. DT40 cells or nuclei (1 × 106) were treated as described (11Samejima K. Toné S. Kottke T.J. Enari M. Sakahira H. Cooke C.A. Durrieu F. Martins L.M. Nagata S. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. J.

Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 3-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with slightly modified conditions. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was performed using the Gene Path System (Bio-Rad). Horizontal gels (1% agarose, Sea Kem, FMC) were run at 14 °C with program no. 18 (Conditions for separation of 50 kb to 1 Mb: 19.5 h, 6.0 V/cm, switch times are initial 5.3 s and final 66.0 s). A 532-bp probe prepared from an EST encoding the C terminus of chickenCAD (from amino acid 259) was used to screen a chicken genomic library, yielding a lambda clone containing the total coding region of the chicken CAD gene plus its flanking sequences. Genomic Southern blot analysis against chicken DU249 cells and DT40 cells using this probe revealed that the CAD gene is present as a single copy with no closely related pseudogenes (data not shown). The complete sequence of the phage DNA revealed that the chickenCAD mRNA is encoded by seven exons, as is murineCAD (23Kawane K. Fukuyama H. Adachi M. Sakahira H. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkin N.A. Nagata S. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). To disrupt the CAD gene in DT40 cells, we constructed targeting vectors designed to replace the total coding region ofCAD with drug resistance cassettes (puromycin or blasticidin) (Fig. 1 A). Following transfection of these vectors into wild type clone 18 DT40 cells, Southern blot analysis with 5′ and 3′ probes revealed that 3 of 18 (puromycin-resistant) and 1 of 26 (blasticidin-resistant) clones had successfully replaced one allele (Fig. 1 B). Next, one of each class of heterozygote (expressing puromycin or blasticidin resistance) was selected and transfected with the complementary resistance marker. In this second round transfection, we obtained 0 of 44 targeted clones with the blasticidin resistance vector. However, 4 of 17 clones transfected with the puromycin resistance vector had undergone targeted events. Southern blot analysis confirmed the lack of the wild type CAD allele in these cells (Fig. 1 B). Two of the resultingCAD −/− clones were selected for further study. The CAD −/− cell lines were healthy with a proliferation rate similar to wild type (CAD +/+ ) and heterozygous (CAD +/− ) cells (data not shown). The doubling time of the three cell types at 39 °C was 10.5 (CAD +/+ ), 10.4 (CAD +/− ), and 10.3 and 10.5 (CAD −/− ) h, respectively. We next examined the response of CAD −/− cells to drugs that induce apoptosis. Upon etoposide or staurosporine treatment, induction of apoptosis was detected by the translocation of phosphatidyl serine to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane (binding of annexin V), direct labeling of activated caspases, and substrate cleavage by caspases. There was no obvious difference betweenCAD +/+ , CAD +/− , andCAD −/− cells in the induction of annexin V staining during 2-h treatment with etoposide (Fig. 1 C). Forin vitro studies, cytosolic extracts were prepared from cells treated with either etoposide or staurosporine. Affinity labeling of caspases in those extracts demonstrated that caspase activation was similar in CAD +/+ , CAD +/− , andCAD −/− cells (Fig. 1 D). When isolated HeLa nuclei were incubated in extracts made from these apoptotic cells, the chromatin-condensed and PARP cleavage occurred normally (Fig. 1,E and F). These results suggested that induction of apoptosis, including activation of caspases, is normal inCAD −/− cells. Two enzymes, CAD/DFF40/CPAN and endonuclease G have been reported to induce oligonucleosomal DNA cleavage in apoptosis (6Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar, 7Halenbeck R. MacDonald H. Roulston A. Chen T.T. Conroy L. Williams L.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 537-540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Liu X. Li P. Widlak P. Zou H. Luo X. Garrard W.T. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8461-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar,15Li L.Y. Luo X. Wang X. Nature. 2001; 412: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar, 16Parrish J. Li L. Klotz K. Ledwich D. Wang X. Xue D. Nature. 2001; 412: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). To assess the relative contributions of the two nucleases in chromatin fragmentation in DT40 cells following exposure to etoposide or staurosporine, we examined the process of internucleosomal DNA cleavage in CAD −/− cells (Fig.2 A). Upon treatment with 50 μm etoposide, CAD +/+ andCAD +/− cells showed robust DNA ladder formation after 2 h. Heterozygous cells showed a slight delay compared withCAD +/+ cells. In contrast,CAD −/− cells showed no ladder formation even after 3 h (box), indicating that CAD is largely responsible for DNA ladder formation in DT40 cells. This result was also confirmed by in vitro studies. When exogenous nuclei (either HeLa or DT40) were incubated with cytosolic extracts from apoptoticCAD +/− or CAD −/− cells,CAD +/− extracts induced formation of an oligonucleosomal ladder, while CAD −/− extracts did not (Fig. 2 B and data not shown). Although CAD is a nuclear protein, no obvious difference in DNA cleavage was observed between DT40 CAD +/+ or CAD −/− nuclei. This could be explained if CAD leaks out during preparation of the substrate nuclei. During apoptosis, cleavage of the chromosomes into fragments of 200–300 kbp and 30–50 kbp is observed prior to oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Studies with ICADknockout mice or cells expressing caspase-uncleavable ICAD, in which the HMW cleavage was not observed (17Zhang J. Liu X. Scherer D.C. van Kaer L. Wang X. Xu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12480-12485Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 18Sakahira H. Enari M. Ohsawa Y. Uchiyama Y. Nagata S. Curr.

Chem. 2001; 276: 38185-38192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggested that CAD might contribute to the HMW DNA cleavage. However, CAD is unlikely to be the sole factor for HMW DNA cleavage, because ICAD and CAD are not expressed in all tissues. Furthermore, some cell types only show HMW DNA cleavage (4Ucker D.S. Obermiller P.S. Eckhart W. Apgar J.R. Berger N.A. Meyers J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3060-3069Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 25Oberhammer F. Bursch W. Tiefenbacher R. Froschl G. Pavelka M. Purchio T. Schulte H.R. Hepatology. 1993; 18: 1238-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Were CAD activated, it is expected that those cells would also show oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation. To determine whether CAD is required for HMW DNA cleavage in DT40 cells, we induced apoptosis in CAD +/+ ,CAD +/− , and CAD −/− cells by treatment with etoposide for 30 min to 4 h and then subjected the DNA to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. HMW cleavage occurred inCAD +/+ , CAD +/− , andCAD −/− cells with essentially identical kinetics (Fig. 2, C and D). After 30 min of etoposide treatment, the chromosomes of CAD −/− cells showed 50- to 300-kbp fragments and by 1 h 30- to 50-kbp fragments became dominant. In CAD +/+ and CAD +/− cells the HMW DNA fragments began to decline after 2 h as the chromosomes were degraded further to produce oligonucleosomal DNA fragments. In CAD −/− cells, the HMW DNA cleavage pattern remained stable for at least 4 h (Fig. 2 D). This result demonstrates clearly that CAD is dispensable for HMW DNA cleavage during drug-induced apoptosis. We do not know the nature of the factor responsible for this cleavage in CAD −/− DT40 cells; however, it is unlikely to be an enzyme that produces DNA ends with a free 3′-OH. Such ends are detected by the TUNEL reaction, and apoptotic CAD −/− cells were negative for TUNEL labeling (Fig. 3, H–J). CAD induces not only DNA cleavage but also chromatin condensation (8Liu X. Li P. Widlak P. Zou H. Luo X. Garrard W.T. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8461-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 11Samejima K. Toné S. Kottke T.J. Enari M. Sakahira H. Cooke C.A. Durrieu F. Martins L.M. Nagata S. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Furthermore, apoptotic DNA condensation was reported to be significantly repressed in cells of the ICADknockout mouse (17Zhang J. Liu X. Scherer D.C. van Kaer L. Wang X. Xu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12480-12485Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Thus we examined whether apoptotic chromatin condensation still occurs in CAD −/− cells. Upon etoposide or staurosporine treatment, these cells reproducibly showed stage I chromatin condensation (chromatin condensed against the nuclear periphery, Fig. 1 G) but never reached stage II (formation of discrete apoptotic bodies, Fig. 3 A). The same treatment readily induced stage II chromatin condensation inCAD +/+ or CAD +/− cells (Fig.3 B and data not shown). Similar data were obtained when isolated HeLa nuclei were incubated in apoptotic extracts prepared from either CAD +/− or CAD −/− cells (Fig. 1 E). Lamins are cleaved relatively late during apoptotic execution and are eventually dispersed throughout the cytoplasm following nuclear lysis (26Lazebnik Y.A. Cole S. Cooke C.A. Nelson W.G. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 7-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar,27Oberhammer F.A. Hochegger K. Fröschl G. Tiefenbacher R. Pavelka M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 827-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). 2K. Samejima, S. Tone, and W. C. Earnshaw, unpublished results. Lamina disassembly was observed during apoptotic execution both in CAD +/− cells, which underwent stage II chromatin condensation (Fig.3 C), and in CAD −/− cells, in which chromatin condensation became arrested at stage I (Fig. 3 D). This control shows that the CAD −/− cells examined were in the late stages of apoptotic execution despite the block in chromatin condensation at stage I. These data reveal that significant levels of apoptotic chromatin condensation can occur in the absence of CAD. To confirm that the phenotypes observed inCAD −/− cells were due to loss of CAD, we transiently transfected CAD −/− cells with a plasmid encoding both the chicken CAD cDNA and GFP under separate promoters. Transfected cells were recognized by the expression of GFP. When we induced apoptosis in cCAD/GFP-transfectedCAD −/− cells with etoposide, cells showed stage II chromatin condensation indistinguishable from CAD +/+ cells (Fig. 3 F). Control CAD −/− cells transfected with vector alone showed stage I chromatin condensation (Fig. 3 G). We also prepared a stableCAD −/− cell line expressing GFP fused to murineCAD (GFP-mCAD). Upon etoposide treatment, this cell line showed stage II chromatin condensation and oligonucleosomal DNA cleavage (data not shown). Collectively, these results confirmed that deletion of the CAD gene was responsible for the phenotype of the CAD −/− cells. We have isolated sublines of chicken DT40 lymphoma cells in which the entire coding region of the CAD gene has been deleted. CAD is not essential for growth, and CAD −/− cells proliferate normally. Upon etoposide or staurosporine treatment,CAD −/− cells become positive for annexin V staining, activate caspases, and cleave PARP in a manner indistinguishable from CAD +/+ orCAD +/− cells. Therefore, induction of apoptosis and the general events of apoptotic execution are normal inCAD −/− cells. All phenotypes observed in CAD −/− cells (see below) were reversed upon transfection of either a cDNA encoding chicken CAD, or a cDNA encoding murine CAD fused to GFP. This confirmed that deletion of the CAD gene was responsible for the various phenotypes. Furthermore, the demonstration that murine CAD can replace the chicken protein must also mean that chicken ICAD can act both as folding chaperone and inhibitor of murine CAD. Because we previously showed that murine ICAD can inhibit chicken CAD in ourin vitro system, these data confirm that CAD and ICAD are interchangeable between birds and mammals. Because CAD has been proposed to be the nuclease responsible for DNA fragmentation during apoptotic execution (6Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar, 28Zhang C. Raghupathi R. Saatman K.E. LaPlaca M.C. McIntosh T.K. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1650-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we first examined the state of DNA cleavage in CAD −/− cells in vivo and in vitro. CAD −/− cells did not show oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation even after exposure to 50 μm etoposide for 3 h, which renders the culture fully apoptotic. Therefore, CAD is essential for oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation in DT40 cells following treatment with etoposide. This is noteworthy, because etoposide is known to induce the mitochondrial cell death pathway (29Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the mitochondrial endonuclease G does not appear to play a significant role in apoptotic execution in these cells. Next we looked at cleavage of the chromosomes into high molecular weight fragments (HMW DNA cleavage). Previous studies had shown that either disruption of the DFF45/ICAD gene (28Zhang C. Raghupathi R. Saatman K.E. LaPlaca M.C. McIntosh T.K. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1650-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) or expression of mutant ICAD that cannot be cleaved by caspases (18Sakahira H. Enari M. Ohsawa Y. Uchiyama Y. Nagata S. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 543-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) severely suppressed HMW DNA cleavage, suggesting that CAD is required for this event. However, CAD −/− DT40 cells clearly showed HMW DNA cleavage with wild type kinetics upon etoposide treatment. Thus, CAD cannot be essential for HMW DNA cleavage. It should be noted that, even though CAD −/− cells underwent HMW DNA cleavage and stage I chromatin condensation (see below), the cells remained TUNEL-negative. TUNEL labeling detects free 3′-OH ends and is a widely used marker for apoptotic cells. The absence of labeling of apoptotic CAD −/− cells indicates one of the following: 1) the nuclease responsible for HMW cleavage does not produce a free 3′-OH; or 2) if free 3′-OH ends are produced, they are inaccessible to the enzymes used for the TUNEL reaction; or 3) if free 3′-OH ends are produced, cleavage sites are so rare that they are not detected by the TUNEL method. The factor responsible for HMW DNA cleavage inCAD −/− cells is unknown. One candidate is DNA topoisomerase IIα (30Lagarkova M.A. Iarovaia O.V. Razin S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20239-20241Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 31Li T.K. Chen A.Y. Yu C. Mao Y. Wang H. Liu L.F. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1553-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), although the role of this enzyme in irreversible apoptotic DNA cleavage has been questioned (32Beere H.M. Chresta C.M. Alejo-Herberg A. Skladanowski A. Dive C. Larsen A.K. Hickman J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 986-996PubMed Google Scholar). Topoisomerase IIα produces a free 3′-OH when it cleaves DNA (33Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2054) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in preliminary results, we have found that addition of ICRF-187, a catalytic inhibitor of topoisomerase IIα (34Tanabe K. Ikegami Y. Ishida R. Andoh T. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4903-4908PubMed Google Scholar), did not suppress the HMW DNA cleavage in the cells treated with staurosporine (data not shown). Thus we believe it unlikely that the HMW nuclease is DNA topoisomerase IIα. At this point, the most likely candidate for the HMW nuclease is AIF, or factors activated downstream from it. AIF, a flavoprotein that is released from mitochondria during the induction of apoptosis (35Susin S.A. Daugas E. Ravagnan L. Samejima K. Zamzami N. Loeffler M. Costantini P. Ferri K.F. Irinopoulou T. Prevost M.C. Brothers G. Mak T.W. Penninge R.J. Earnshaw W.C. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar) has been shown to be essential for programmed cell death during cavitation of mouse embryoid bodies and when ES cells are exposed to low serum (36Joza N. Susin S.A. Daugas E. Stanford W.L. Cho S.K. Li C.Y. Sasaki T. Elia A.J. Cheng H.Y. Ravagnan L. Ferri K.F. Zamzami N. Wakeham A. Hakem R. Yoshida H. Kong Y.Y. Mak T.W. Zuniga-Pflucker J.C. Kroemer G. Penninger J.M. Nature. 2001; 410: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). AIF acts in a pathway parallel to CAD in apoptotic execution, is required for HMW DNA cleavage in vivo in the presence of uncleavable ICAD and can induce this cleavage in isolated nuclei (35Susin S.A. Daugas E. Ravagnan L. Samejima K. Zamzami N. Loeffler M. Costantini P. Ferri K.F. Irinopoulou T. Prevost M.C. Brothers G. Mak T.W. Penninge R.J. Earnshaw W.C. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). It is not known whether AIF-induced DNA breaks can be detected by TUNEL. 3G. Kroemer, personal communication. CAD −/− cells undergo stage I chromatin condensation (formation of a ring of condensed chromatin against the nuclear periphery) during apoptotic execution. This is particularly interesting, because it was reported that chromatin condensation is severely suppressed in cells of the ICAD knockout mouse (17Zhang J. Liu X. Scherer D.C. van Kaer L. Wang X. Xu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12480-12485Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In contrast, stage I chromatin condensation still occurred in the presence of mutant ICAD that is resistant to caspase cleavage (11Samejima K. Toné S. Kottke T.J. Enari M. Sakahira H. Cooke C.A. Durrieu F. Martins L.M. Nagata S. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 17Zhang J. Liu X. Scherer D.C. van Kaer L. Wang X. Xu M.

Thus, the control of chromatin condensation in apoptosis is complex. Both purified active CAD and purified AIF induce chromatin condensation when added to nuclei (11Samejima K. Toné S. Kottke T.J. Enari M. Sakahira H. Cooke C.A. Durrieu F. Martins L.M. Nagata S. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 35Susin S.A. Daugas E.

Med. 2000; 192: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Therefore, AIF, which induces Stage I condensation, could be responsible for the chromatin condensation in CAD −/− cells. Our preliminaryin vitro studies have suggested that stage I chromatin condensation occurs in the absence of ongoing caspase activity, which has also been proposed to be a characteristic of AIF action (35Susin S.A. Daugas E. Ravagnan L. Samejima K. Zamzami N. Loeffler M. Costantini P. Ferri K.F. Irinopoulou T. Prevost M.C. Brothers G. Mak T.W. Penninge R.J. Earnshaw W.C. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). However, we cannot exclude that other factors, including acinus (37Sahara S. Aoto M. Eguchi Y. Imamoto N. Yoneda Y. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 401: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) and DNA topoisomerase IIα (12Durrieu F. Samejima K. Fortune J.M. Kandels-Lewis S. Osheroff N. Earnshaw W.C. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 923-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), could also contribute to apoptotic chromatin condensation, although the latter is less likely, because ICRF-187 did not inhibit chromatin condensation inCAD −/− cells treated with staurosporine. In summary, we have provided the first direct genetic evidence that CAD is dispensable for HMW DNA cleavage and stage I chromatin condensation during apoptotic execution. Surprisingly, the apoptotic phenotypes of our CAD −/− cells differed with respect to HMW DNA cleavage and chromatin condensation from those reported with theICAD −/− mouse (17Zhang J. Liu X. Scherer D.C. van Kaer L. Wang X. Xu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12480-12485Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) or following expression of mutant ICAD that cannot be cleaved by caspases (18Sakahira H. Enari M. Ohsawa Y. Uchiyama Y. Nagata S. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 543-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This could potentially be explained if the incorrectly folded CAD has a dominant effect on chromatin condensation in the ICAD deletion mouse. However, a simpler interpretation of our results is that ICAD might have other as yet unknown functions during apoptotic execution. For example, ICAD might modulate the accessibility to chromatin of not only CAD but also one or more other factors. Our CAD −/− cell lines should provide useful tools to further characterize the processes of HMW DNA cleavage and chromatin condensation during apoptotic execution.

https://openalex.org/W2080590043,"Mesangial expansion is a key feature in the pathogenesis of numerous renal diseases involving the glomerulus. Studies indicate that mutations in apolipoprotein E (apoE) might independently contribute to kidney dysfunction. Although the role of apoE as an atheroprotective molecule is well established, its role in kidney is unclear. In this study, we sought to explore whether apoE has a protective function in kidney. Northern blotting and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction showed apoE expression in kidney, and mesangial cell is a major source of apoE in kidney. In the kidneys of 14–16-month-old apoE-null mice, hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining revealed increased mesangial cell proliferation and matrix formation compared with wild type mice or apoB-overexpressing mice, which have elevated plasma cholesterol and triglycerides. These data suggest that lack of apoE, rather than hyperlipidemia, contributes to increased mesangial expansion. We isolated mesangial cells from mouse kidney and determined the effect of apoE on cell growth. ApoE (E3, 10 μg/ml) completely inhibited serum, platelet-derived growth factor (10 ng/ml), as well as low density lipoprotein-induced mesangial cell proliferation. Among the three isoforms, E3 was found to be most effective in inhibiting mesangial cell proliferation. ApoE did not show any cytotoxic effect, and moreover, inhibited mesangial cell apoptosis induced by oxidized low density lipoprotein. These data suggest that apoE regulates growth as well as survival of mesangial cells. We previously showed that apoE induces matrix heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) in vascular cells, which has an antiproliferative effect. Similarly, apoE induced the mesangial matrix HSPG. Perlecan is the major HSPG of mesangial matrix and subendothelial space, and consistent with this, blockade of perlecan reversed the antiproliferative effect of apoE. Immunohistochemistry revealed reduced staining of perlecan in kidney from apoE-null mice. Because the loss of anionic HSPG in the basement membrane and mesangial matrix is associated with disruption of filtration barrier, these data suggest a novel role for kidney apoE in preserving the filtration barrier. In summary, apoE has a protective function in kidney as an autocrine regulator of mesangial expansion and kidney function.

Besides mesangial expansion, a prominent feature of glomerulosclerosis and nephropathy is decreased matrix HSPG (4Jensen T. Diabetes. 1997; 46: S98-S100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5van den Born J. van Kraats A.A. Bakker M.A. Assmann K.J. Dijkman H.B. van der Laak J.A. Berden J.H.

Because HSPG is a key regulator of mesangial growth (8Castellot Jr., J.J. Hoover R.L. Harper P.A. Karnovsky M.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1985; 120: 427-435PubMed Google Scholar), it is conceivable that the decreased HSPG in part contributes to increased mesangial proliferation. Understanding the regulation of mesangial proliferation is important for the design of therapeutic strategies to alleviate or arrest proliferative glomerular disease. ApoE is a major protein component of plasma lipoproteins and plays a key role in lipoprotein clearance (9Mahley R.W.

A lack of apoE results in hyperlipidemia and in the development of atherosclerosis (11Zhang S.H. Reddick R.L. Piedrahita J.A. Maeda N.

This atheroprotective effect of apoE could be because of any of the recently identified novel functions, prominent among these is their ability to inhibit smooth muscle cell proliferation and increase vascular HSPG (16Paka L.

Atherosclerosis and glomerulosclerosis have several common features including loss of HSPG, endothelial dysfunction, and unregulated cell proliferation. Thus, kidney apoE could be protective against the development of glomerulosclerosis. Although apoE expression was shown in kidney (19Wallis S.C. Rogne S. Gill L. Markham A. Edge M. Woods D.

Our studies show that apoE regulates mesangial expansion and HSPG levels, and a lack of apoE contributes to increased mesangial proliferation and matrix accumulation. Kidneys used in these studies were obtained from 14–16-month-old mice (Jackson Laboratories) of the following strains: C57BL/6 mice (n = 4), apoE-null mice on C57BL/6 background (n = 6), and human apoB transgenic (HuBTg) mice (n = 6). HuBTg mice had a mixed genetic background of predominantly C57BL/6J (>75%) and FVB/N strains (21Kako Y. Huang L.S. Yang J. Katopodis T. Ramakrishnan R. Goldberg I.J. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 2185-2194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and were fed on a western-type diet. The cholesterol and triglyceride levels of these mice are as follows: cholesterol (mg/dl) −70 ± 23 (WT), 315 ± 45 (apoE-null), and 260 ± 27 (HuBTg) and triglycerides (mg/dl) −64 ± 29 (WT), 91 ± 30 (apoE-null), and 140 ± 38 (HuBTg). Kidney tissues were cut into small pieces, fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, and 4-μm sections were stained with HE and examined under microscope. At least 20 glomeruli for each tissue were evaluated for cell count. The extracellular matrix expansion was analyzed and quantitated as described previously (22Raij L. Azar S. Keane W. Kidney Int. 1984; 26: 137-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Mesangial cells from C57BL/6 mice were isolated and cultured as described previously (23Wolf G. Haberstroh U. Neilson E.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 140: 95-107PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with insulin-transferrin-sodium selenite media (Sigma) and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Cells used in experiments were from passages 5–10. Glomerular epithelial cells were maintained in 10% FCS-RPMI 1640 medium. Tubular epithelial cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Madin-Darby canine kidney) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FCS. LDL (d < 1.063) was isolated from fresh human plasma in the presence of EDTA by ultracentrifugation and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.5 mm EDTA. Oxidized LDL (OxLDL) was prepared by dialyzing the LDL with 10 μm copper sulfate for 24 h at room temperature as described previously (24Heinecke J.W. Rosen H. Chait A. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 1890-1894Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Apolipoprotein E isoforms, E2, E3, and E4 were obtained from Calbiochem. Unless indicated otherwise, apoE3 was used in all experiments. Cell proliferation was assessed by [3H]thymidine incorporation as described previously (18Paka L. Goldberg I.J. Obunike J.C. Choi S.Y.

Mesangial cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 104/well in a 48-well plate, and experiments were performed the following day (40–50% confluency). Cells were treated with serum-free medium for 24 h followed by serum medium with or without various agents for 24 h. The cells were then labeled with [3H]thymidine for 6 h, and the radioactivity incorporated into DNA was determined by a scintillation counter. Apoptotic cells were determined by counting the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase end-labeling (TUNEL)-positive nuclei (Dead End Colorimetric Apoptosis Detection System, Promega). Equal numbers of cells were plated on chamber slides (Nalgene-Nunc) and cultured for 24 h followed by 24 h of serum starvation. The cells were treated with 1) normal media as control, 2) media with 50 μg/ml LDL, 3) media with 50 μg/ml OxLDL, 4) media with 50 μg/ml LDL and 10 μg/ml apoE, or 5) media with 50 μg/ml OxLDL and 10 μg/ml apoE. Two days later, the cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. TUNEL-positive cells were identified according to protocol by the manufacturer. Total RNA was extracted from kidneys of C57BL/6 and apoE-null mice and used for Northern analysis. Plasmid (pJS381) containing apoE clone was kindly provided by Dr. Jonathan Smith (Rockefeller University, NY). A 1053-bp apoE fragment was generated by restriction digestion of pJS381 by XbaI. The probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random primer labeling according to the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Hybridization was carried out for 6 h at 68 °C in Perfect-Hyb Plus hybridization solution (Sigma). The same membrane was rehybridized with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as internal control. Total RNA (2 μg) was subjected to RT-PCR using the following primers: forward 5′-CCAATCACAGGCAGGAAGAT-3′ and reverse 5′-CTCCTGCACCTGCTCAGAC-3′. The predicted polymerase chain reaction product using these primers is a 261-bp fragment. Confluent mesangial cells were incubated in culture medium containing either [3H]glucosamine or 35SO4 with or without 10 μg/ml apoE for 24 h. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans associated with cells and those secreted into medium were determined as described previously following purification by DEAE-cellulose chromatography and digestion with heparinase (18Paka L.

ApoE effects on proteoglycans in different pools, pericellular (trypsin-releasable representing cell surface and extracellular proteoglycans), cellular (Triton X-100/NH4 releasable), and matrix (guanidine hydrochloride extractable following Triton X-100 treatment), were determined as described previously (18Paka L.

Pericellular proteoglycans minus matrix proteoglycans was represented as cell surface proteoglycans. Rat monoclonal antiperlecan antibody was purchased from Neo Markers Inc., and conjugated with fluorescein by QuickTag FITC conjugation kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the recommended procedures. Kidneys from WT and apoE-null mice were embedded in OCT and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. 6 μm of frozen sections were fixed in cold acetone, rinsed in PBS, and incubated in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 20 min. The sections were then incubated with FITC-conjugated perlecan antibody (1:100 dilution) followed by detection by fluorescence microscope. For negative control, slides were preincubated with 5× non-FITC-labeled perlecan antibody. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Experiments were done in triplicates and repeated at least once. Statistical analyses were performed by Student's t test to determine the significance of change. A significance difference was considered for p values that are equal to or less than 0.05. ApoE is known to be antiproliferative in smooth muscle cells (17Ishigami M. Swertfeger D.K. Granholm N.A. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20156-20161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 18Paka L. Goldberg I.J. Obunike J.C. Choi S.Y. Saxena U. Goldberg I.D. Pillarisetti S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36403-36408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Because the mesangial cell is phenotypically similar to the smooth muscle cell, we first investigated whether a lack of apoE results in altered mesangial morphology in kidney. ApoE-null mice have both high plasma cholesterol and triglycerides, and in order to distinguish the effects of apoE from those of hyperlipidemia, we also examined HuBTg mice. These mice are transgenic for human apoB and are a distinct model for hyperlipidemia. Kidney sections from wild type mice (WT, C57BL/6), apoE-null mice, and HuBTg mice were examined by HE staining (Fig.1). Significantly increased mesangial proliferation was seen in kidneys from apoE-null mice compared with kidneys from WT mice (p < 0.01) or HuBTg mice (p < 0.05). The most striking change in apoE-null mice was the matrix overproduction in comparison with WT and apoB mice (p < 0.01). Interestingly, the gross kidney of HuBTg mouse is much bigger than that of WT and apoE-null mice, and enlarged glomerulus was observed with mild cell proliferation, which was significantly different from that of WT mouse. However, there was no prominent matrix expansion in HuBTg mice (Fig. 1, TableI). These data suggest that a lack of apoE contributes to mesangial cell proliferation and matrix expansion in the kidney.Table IMorphological changes in glomeruli from wild type apoE-null and apoB transgenic miceCellSclerosisWT (n = 4)35.1 ± 0.10.5 ± 0.2ApoE-null (n = 6)59.8 ± 14.21-ap < 0.01versus WT.1-bp < 0.05 versusApoB-Tg.2.0 ± 0.51-cp < 0.01 versusWT.1-dp < 0.01 versusApoB-Tg.ApoB-Tg (n= 4)42.9 ± 2.51-ep < 0.05 versusWT.0.5 ± 0.3Glomerular cell numbers and sclerosis score of kidneys from wild type (WT), apoE-null and apoB transgenic (ApoB-Tg) mice.

Kidney sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and examined under microscope. At least 20 glomeruli for each tissue were evaluated for cell count and extracellular matrix expression as described under “Materials and Methods.” To correlate apoE expression to mesangial expansion, we determined apoE expression in kidney and kidney cell types. Northern blot analysis of total kidney RNA showed apoE expression in kidneys of WT but not of apoE-null mice (Fig. 2A). RT-PCR of total RNA isolated from different kidney cell types revealed a strong expression of apoE in mesangial cells (Fig. 2B). A weak band was also seen in glomerular epithelial cells. Both tubular epithelial cells and endothelial cells were negative for apoE expression. The results suggest that mesangial cell is a major contributor of kidney apoE. To determine the effects of apoE on cell proliferation, we isolated mesangial cells from wild type mouse kidney and tested whether apoE inhibits mesangial cell proliferation. ApoE (10 μg/ml) completely inhibited serum-stimulated cell growth (Fig. 3A). At a similar dose, apoE did not affect glomerular epithelial cell proliferation (Fig. 3B). We previously reported that apoE does not inhibit endothelial proliferation (18Paka L. Goldberg I.J. Obunike J.C. Choi S.Y. Saxena U. Goldberg I.D. Pillarisetti S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36403-36408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, the antiproliferative effect of apoE is specific for mesangial cells. Although the trigger for mesangial proliferation is not clear, studies have identified several possible candidates including PDGF, interleukin-6, and LDL (25Schocklmann H.O. Lang S. Sterzel R.B. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 26Eitner F. Westerhuis R. Burg M. Weinhold B. Grone H.J. Ostendorf T. Ruther U. Koch K.M. Rees A.J.

Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 1604-1611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We tested whether apoE can suppress the growth-promoting effects of these agents. Incubation of mesangial cells with PDGF (10 ng/ml) resulted in a 2–2.5-fold increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA (Fig.4A). Similarly, LDL (20 μg/ml) increased [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA by ∼2-fold (Fig. 4B). The addition of apoE completely reversed this effect. These data show that the antiproliferative effects of apoE extend to a variety of mesangial growth inducers. We next tested whether the antiproliferative effects of apoE are isoform-specific. At similar concentrations, apoE3 was found to be most effective (∼50%) in inhibiting mesangial cell proliferation (Fig.4C). ApoE4 also showed significant inhibition (∼30%,p < 0.05). ApoE2 showed moderate effect (∼19%) on mesangial proliferation. Several antiproliferative agents can also induce cell apoptosis. To rule out the possibility that the antiproliferative effect of apoE is because of apoptosis, we determined the effect of apoE on OxLDL-induced apoptosis. Confluent mesangial cells were incubated with OxLDL (50 μg/ml) and LDL (50 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of apoE for 48 h. Under these conditions only OxLDL but not LDL induced mesangial cell apoptosis as determined by TUNEL staining. OxLDL-induced cell apoptosis was completely blocked by apoE, and virtually no apoptotic cells were observed (Fig. 5). These data show that apoE plays a key role in both the regulation of proliferation as well as the survival of mesangial cells. The mechanism by which apoE inhibits mesangial cell proliferation is not clear. Heparan sulfate and HSPG are potent inhibitors of mesangial proliferation, and we previously showed that apoE induced HSPG in smooth muscle cells (18Paka L. Goldberg I.J. Obunike J.C. Choi S.Y. Saxena U. Goldberg I.D. Pillarisetti S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36403-36408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We next tested whether apoE inhibits mesangial cell proliferation by increasing HSPG. Subconfluent monolayers of mesangial cells were incubated with apoE, and cellular HSPG were expressed as a ratio to cell number. ApoE3 increased HSPG to cell ratio by >2-fold (Fig.6A). E2 and E4 were less effective, and this may in part explain their effects on mesangial cell proliferation (Fig. 4C). The kidney, like other tissues, contain different HSPGs including syndecan and glypican (cell surface) and perlecan (extracellular matrix). ApoE treatment resulted in the induction of HSPG in all pools (Fig. 6B). Perlecan is the major HSPG in the glomerular basement membrane as well as mesangial matrix and may contribute to the regulation of mesangial cell proliferation (28Iozzo R.V. Cohen I.R Grassel S. Murdoch A.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 625-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 29Groffen A.J. Veerkamp J.H. Monnens L.A. van den Heuvel L.P. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 1999; 14: 2119-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We next tested whether the induction of perlecan mediates the antiproliferative effect of apoE (Fig.6C). Perlecan antibody but not mouse IgG reversed the antiproliferative effect of apoE, suggesting that perlecan contributes to the antiproliferative effect of apoE. We next determined whether the absence of apoE results in altered perlecan expression in kidney. Immunohistochemical analysis of perlecan in WT and apoE-null mice revealed significantly decreased staining in apoE-null mice (Fig. 7). These data suggest that the morphological changes seen in apoE-null kidney may in part be due to decreased perlecan. Our data for the first time identify a protective role for apoE in preventing a proliferative phenotype in kidney. Mice that are deficient in apoE have both increased proliferation as well as matrix overproduction, a hallmark of kidney pathogenesis. Several human studies identified an association between apoE polymorphism and nephropathy (30Chowdhury T.A. Dyer P.H. Kumar S. Gibson S.P. Rowe B.R. Davies S.J. Marshall S.M. Morris P.J. Gill G.V.

A recent large case-controlled study with 223 subjects showed a 3.1-fold increase in the risk of diabetic nephropathy in subjects carrying E2 allele of apoE (34Araki S. Moczulski D.K. Hanna L. Scott L.J. Warram J.H. Krolewski A.S. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 2190-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanisms underlying this increased risk are unclear, it is often thought to be because of dyslipidemia, in particular, to increased triglycerides. However, our data on mesangial matrix accumulation in HuBTg mice suggest lipid-independent effects on mesangial expansion in apoE-null mice. HuBTg mice, despite having hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceredemia, clearly did not show changes in mesangial morphology that are seen in apoE-null mice. ApoE2, as we previously showed, has no significant antiproliferative effect on smooth muscle cells (18Paka L. Goldberg I.J. Obunike J.C. Choi S.Y. Saxena U. Goldberg I.D. Pillarisetti S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36403-36408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that the increased risk of nephropathy in E2 subjects is in part attributed to the inability of apoE2 to regulate mesangial expansion. Apart from liver, studies showed that kidney is a major source of apoE (19Wallis S.C. Rogne S. Gill L. Markham A. Edge M. Woods D. Williamson R. Humphries S. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 2369-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 20Blue M.L. Williams D.L. Zucker S. Khan S.A. Blum C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Our Northern data confirmed this finding and showed an intense band of apoE in WT mice but not in apoE-null mice. Although kidney expression of apoE has been clearly demonstrated, the source of apoE in kidney is not known. Early studies showed relatively greater amounts of apoE synthesis in the cortex compared with medulla (20Blue M.L. Williams D.L. Zucker S. Khan S.A. Blum C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). RT-PCR analysis of different kidney cell types in the current study showed that mesangial cells are a major source of apoE expression. Mesangial cell proliferation and matrix overproduction are the predominant pathological features of many forms of glomerulonephritis, such as IgA nephropathy, lupus nephropathy, and diabetic nephropathy and frequently precedes the increase of extracellular matrix in the mesangium and the development of glomerulosclerosis (2Stockand J.D. Sansom S.C. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1997; 29: 971-981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 3Grond J. Weening J.J. Contrib. Nephrol. 1990; 81: 229-239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When exposed to injurious stimuli such as hyperglycemia, glycated proteins, or oxidants, the mesangial cell responds by cellular proliferation and matrix synthesis. A key example of this is the pro-sclerotic cytokine-transforming growth factor-β, which is induced by many diabetic stimuli (35Rossert J. Terraz-Durasnel C. Brideau G. Diabetes Metab. 2000; 26: S16-S24PubMed Google Scholar, 36Sharma K. McGowan T.A. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The up-regulation of transforming growth factor-β may be a necessary event in the removal and repair of damaged matrix. However, a loss of proper regulation of this repair process may ultimately progress to the development of glomerulosclerosis. Expression of apoE in mesangial cells may serve as an autocrine regulator of such uncontrolled mesangial expansion. Our data clearly establish apoE as an antiproliferative molecule for mesangial cells. It inhibited mesangial proliferation induced by different stimuli including growth factors and lipids. This finding is consistent with the observed apoE effects on smooth muscle cells in which the proliferative effects of serum, PDGF, OxLDL, and lysolecithin were inhibited by apoE (18Paka L. Goldberg I.J. Obunike J.C. Choi S.Y. Saxena U. Goldberg I.D. Pillarisetti S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36403-36408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The antiproliferative effects of apoE, however, were not attributed to the induction of apoptosis. Instead, apoE was found to be antiapoptotic and prevented oxidant-induced apoptosis. Proliferation as well as apoptosis of mesangial cells has been shown in glomerular diseases (37Makino H. Sugiyama H. Kashihara N. Kidney Int. 2000; 58: S67-S75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 38Saleh H. Schlatter E. Lang D. Pauels H.G. Heidenreich S. Kidney Int. 2000; 58: 1876-1884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both processes may regulate the cellular content of the mesangium by closely influencing each other. Thus, apoE may offer a dual protection against proliferation and apoptosis. Increasing matrix HSPG (perlecan) is a probable mechanism by which apoE can be antiproliferative to mesangial cells. Consistent with previous studies with smooth muscle cells (18Paka L. Goldberg I.J. Obunike J.C. Choi S.Y. Saxena U. Goldberg I.D. Pillarisetti S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36403-36408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), perlecan antibody significantly blocked the antiproliferative effect of apoE on mesangial cells. Obunike et al. (39Obunike J.C. Pillarisetti S. Paka L. Kako Y. Butteri M.J. Ho Y.Y. Wagner W.D. Yamada N. Mazzone T. Deckelbaum R.J Goldberg I.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) previously showed that lipoprotein lipase (LpL), like apoE, can induce proteoglycans in other cell types. However, it is not known whether this increase is in HSPG or in perlecan. Recent studies (40Mamputu J.C. Levesque L. Renier G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 2212-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 41Stevenson F.T. Shearer G.C. Atkinson D.N. Kidney Int. 2001; 59: 2062-2068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from two different laboratories showed that LpL, in contrast to apoE, stimulates proliferation of smooth muscle and mesangial cells. The antiproliferative effects of apoE on smooth muscle cells appear to require LpL activity. It is conceivable that residual serum lipids (lipoprotein-derived) or cellular lipids are hydrolyzed by LpL leading to the generation of fatty acids or lysolipids, both of which can activate protein kinase C, a mitogenic signal. Not surprisingly, these authors found that protein kinase C inhibitors completely blocked LpL-induced proliferation. The ability of ApoE to increase mesangial (current study) and endothelial HSPG (16Paka L. Kako Y. Obunike J.C. Pillarisetti S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4816-4823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) may have other implications. Apart from being antiproliferative to mesangial cells, HSPG plays an important role in barrier function (4Jensen T. Diabetes. 1997; 46: S98-S100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5van den Born J. van Kraats A.A. Bakker M.A. Assmann K.J. Dijkman H.B. van der Laak J.A. Berden J.H.

Veerkamp J.H. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence supports the hypothesis that a loss of heparan sulfate may play a pathophysiological role in the development of diabetic vascular complications. Our data show decreased staining for perlecan in apoE-null mice. Perlecan, the major HSPG of the basement membrane and mesangial matrix, plays an important role in the assembly and structure of the basement membrane and regulation of basement membrane permeability (42Pillarisetti S. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In diabetic patients with mesangial cell expansion and clinical nephropathy, a negative correlation was observed among the number of anionic sites representing HSPG in the glomerular basement membrane, and urinary albumin secretion was also observed (6Tamsma J.T. van den Born J. Bruijn J.A. Assmann K.J. Weening J.J. Berden J.H. Wieslander J. Schrama E. Hermans J. Veerkamp J.H. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Heparin, which increases HSPG, has been shown to reduce albuminuria in patients with incipient diabetic nephropathy (43van Der Woude F.J. Haemostasis. 1999; 29: S61-S67PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, apoE by virtue of its ability to induce perlecan may help preserve barrier function and inhibit the hyperpermeability associated with kidney dysfunction. To determine whether morphological changes seen in apoE-null mice correlate with permeability changes, we determined urine albumin in wild type and apoE-null mice. Serum creatinine levels were similar in wild type and apoE-null mice (27.27 ± 6.53 μmol/literversus 28.32 ± 5.01 μmol/liter). Although it did not reach statistical significance, urinary albumin was elevated in apoE-null mice (1.7 ± 0.24 mg/mmol creatinine in apoE-null mice compared with 1.38 ± 0.1 mg/mmol creatinine in wild type mice,p = 0.09, n = 4). Further studies requiring large number of animals are needed to conclusively show kidney dysfunction in apoE-null mice. Several non-traditional and novel functions of apoE are only beginning to be realized (42Pillarisetti S. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Data presented here add to the growing list of protective effects that apoE possesses. In addition to its antiproliferative and HSPG-inducing effects, apoE can also be an antioxidant (44Miyata M. Smith J.D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Because oxidant stress is a major player in nephropathy, it will be of interest to see whether overexpression of apoE offers protection against the development of nephropathy and kidney dysfunction.

An early event of cell adhesion is integrin activation (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9014) Google Scholar). Following adhesion, the assembly of a focal adhesion complex, consisting of many cytoskeletal proteins, is required for cells to spread (2Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2930) Google Scholar). Many intracellular and extracellular signals regulate integrin activation (3Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2816) Google Scholar). In the case of β2 integrins, activation is tightly regulated by a number of intracellular signals, often originating from other receptors. For example, on T cells, adhesion is activated by cross-linking of T cell receptors (4Dustin M.L. Springer T.A. Nature. 1989; 341: 619-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). Activation of integrins by signals originating within the cell is termed “inside-out” signaling (5O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of inside-out signal transduction is not clear, both protein kinase C (PKC)1 and the cytoskeleton are involved (for review see Refs. 3Clark E.A. Brugge J.S.

In unactivated leukocytes, β2 integrins are relatively immobile in the membrane because of cytoskeletal constraints. Activation of PKC with phorbol ester releases these constraints, allowing the integrins to diffuse and increasing their probability of encountering ligand (8Kucik D.F. Dustin M.L. Miller J.T. Brown E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2139-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Although the exact mechanism of PKC's involvement is not clear, its kinase activity causes a relaxation of cytoskeleton. It has been shown by direct measurement of integrin mobility that, not only phorbol esters, but also PKC-activating cytokines (9Zhou X.-M. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20217-20222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) stimulate the mobility of β2 integrin molecules on the membrane. The PKC signal is most likely transduced by MacMARCKS protein (10Li J. Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 70: 791-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 11Blackshear P.J. Verghese G.M.

First, the restriction of mobility of integrins before activation is mediated by the cytoskeleton. The role of the cytoskeleton in this process was confirmed previously by treating cells with low dose (0.1–0.3 μg/ml) cytochalasin D to partially depolymerize the actin cytoskeleton. This not only stimulated β2 integrin mobility but also activated β2-mediated cell adhesion (8Kucik D.F. Dustin M.L. Miller J.T. Brown E.J. J. Clin.

Multivalent or clustered ligand may then promote further formation of integrin clusters. Integrin clustering results in “outside-in” signaling, activating signaling pathways within the cell. Third, cytoskeletal proteins participate in activation of adhesion by their involvement in outside-in signaling. In response to integrin clustering, paxillin (23Graham I.L. Anderson D.C. Holers V.M. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 24Fuortes M. Jin W.W. Nathan C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1477-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and other proteins (25Guan J.-L. Shalloway D. Nature. 1992; 358: 690-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar) are tyrosine-phosphorylated. Subsequently, cytoskeletal proteins are recruited to link the cytoskeleton to integrins, forming focal adhesions. This stabilizes the clusters (26Miyamoto S. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. Science. 1995; 267: 883-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar), enhancing cell adhesion and spreading. At this stage, an intact actin cytoskeleton is required for the assembly of focal adhesions, because at high concentrations of cytochalasin D, cells fail to spread. It is interesting that the actin filaments play opposite roles in cell adhesion and cell spreading. Although partial disruption of actin results in activation of the β2 integrin, an intact actin cytoskeleton is needed to establish adhesions for cell spreading. It has been demonstrated that microtubules are also involved in cell spreading (27Ivanova O.Y. Margolis J.M. Vasiliev J.M. Gelfand I.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1976; 101: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 28De Brabander, M., De Mey, J., Ven de Veire, R., Aerts, F., and Geuens, G. (1977) Cell Biol. Int.

For example, depolymerization of microtubules with nocodazole causes spreading macrophages to retract quickly into a spherical shape (30Cheung H.T. Terry D.S. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1980; 4: 1125-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Similarly, in fibroblasts, cell spreading is impaired when microtubules are disassembled (27Ivanova O.Y. Margolis J.M. Vasiliev J.M. Gelfand I.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1976; 101: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 28De Brabander, M., De Mey, J., Ven de Veire, R., Aerts, F., and Geuens, G. (1977) Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 453–461.Google Scholar). Indeed, cell spreading closely correlates with microtubule integrity, which can influence both the growth of actin stress fibers and the assembly of focal adhesions (32Bershadsky A. Chausolvsky A. Becker E. Lyubimova A. Geiger B. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1279-1289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 33Kaverina I. Rottner K. Small J.V. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Growing microtubule filaments are targeted toward the focal adhesion site (33Kaverina I. Rottner K. Small J.V. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), and such microtubule targeting seems to influence the turnover rate of focal adhesions (35Kaverina I. Krylyshkina O. Small J.V. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1033-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In addition to microtubules themselves, microtubule-associated proteins are also involved in cell spreading. For example, kinesin, the plus-end-directed microtubule-dependent motor protein, is involved, because anti-kinesin antibody decreases cell spreading when injected into cells (29Rodionov V.I. Gyoeva F.K. Tanaka E. Bershadsky A.D. Vasiliev J.M. Gelfand V.I. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1811-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Dynamitin, a component of dynein-dynactin motor complex, is also involved in cell spreading (31Yue L. Lu S. Garces J. Jin T. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23948-23956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) via its P62 subunit, which localizes to focal contacts (34Garces J.A. Clark I.B. Meyer D.I. Vallee R.B. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1497-1500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It has not yet been established, however, whether the microtubule cytoskeleton also plays a dual role, as actin does, affecting activation of adhesion and cell spreading in different ways. Such a dual role in leukocytes would be consistent with a recent study that showed differential effects of microtubule-disrupting agents on adhesion and spreading in an adenocarcinoma cell line (36Kadi A. Pichard V. Lehmann M. Briand C. Braguer D. Marvaldi J. Rognoni J.B. Luis J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 690-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In this report, we investigated the roles of both microtubule disruption and stabilization on β2 integrin mobility and its consequences for leukocyte adhesion. We used Single Particle Tracking, in which receptor movement was visualized by conjugating small particles (40–200 nm) to the integrins (8Kucik D.F. Dustin M.L. Miller J.T. Brown E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2139-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 37Kucik D.F. Elson E.L. Sheetz M.P. Biophys.

Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1617-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and positions of single molecules were determined with nanometer level spatial resolution and 30-ms time resolution (42Kucik D.F. Elson E.L. Sheetz M.P. Nature. 1989; 340: 315-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 43Qian H. Sheetz M.P. Elson E.L. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 910-921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Restricted thermal motion of the integrins is then used as a readout for cytoskeletal connections (8Kucik D.F. Dustin M.L. Miller J.T. Brown E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2139-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 9Zhou X.-M. Li J. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 977-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). We showed that depolymerization of microtubules enhanced mobility of the β2 integrin molecules, a very early step in β2 integrin activation. Our data clearly indicate that, although depolymerization of microtubules inhibits cell spreading, it releases β2integrins to diffuse freely, resulting in activation of cell adhesion. This is associated with increased tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin, a biochemical marker of outside-in signaling (14Li J. Zhu Z. Bao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12985-12990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 23Graham I.L. Anderson D.C. Holers V.M. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Furthermore, similar effects of stabilization of microtubules by taxol indicate that it is the dynamics of the microtubule system, not their presence or absence, that is required for regulation of β2integrin-dependent adhesion. These results provide new insights into the mechanism of regulation of integrin mobility and define an unforeseen role for microtubules. J774 and Wehi 274.1 cells were purchased from the ATCC. MP EBV-transformed B cells were a gift from Eric Brown, University of California at San Francisco. Hybridoma HB 226, which produces hamster anti-mouse β2 integrin antibody (2E6) (44Metlay J.P.

Med. 1990; 171: 1753-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar), was purchased from the ATCC and was grown in serum-free media from Life Technologies, Inc. (Grand Island, NY). After removing the hybridoma, we collected the antibody-containing supernatant and concentrated it for later use. The carboxylated fluorescent latex beads were purchased from Molecular Probes (catalog number F-8811, Oregon, 200 nm in size). Colloidal gold beads were from EY Laboratories, San Mateo, CA. DMEM and other cell culture media were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), cytochalasin D, colchicine, nocodazole, taxol, neuraminidase X, and other routine chemicals were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). J774 cells, Wehi 274.1.1 cells, and mutant cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). MP EBV-transformed B cells were cultured in RPMI with 10% FBS. Before the experiment, 5 × 106 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) once and then treated with neuraminidase X (1 milliunit in 3 ml of buffer containing 0.13m NaCl, 0.05 m sodium acetate, pH 6.5) for 30 min. Then 0.5 ml of the cell suspension was added to 2.5 ml of Hanks' solution and plated on an acid-washed coverslip coated with poly-l-lysine (8Kucik D.F. Dustin M.L. Miller J.T. Brown E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2139-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 45Wright S.D. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 204-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For the MP cell experiments, colloidal gold particles were coated with antibody IB4, a monoclonal specific for β2 integrins (46Wright S.D. Rao P.E. van Voorhis W.C. Craigmyle L.S. Iida K. Talle M.A. Westberg E.F. Goldstein G. Silverstein S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5699-5703Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). For the EBV-transformed B cells experiments, 100-nm colloidal beads were coated by adsorption as described previously, to be consistent with Kuciket al. (8Kucik D.F. Dustin M.L. Miller J.T. Brown E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2139-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). For J774 and Wehi experiments, Fab2fragments of anti-β2 integrin antibody (2E6) at a concentration of 10 mg/ml were conjugated to the carboxylated beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Probes, Oregon). In a glass tube, 100 μl of antibody or BSA was added to the reaction mixture containing 50 μl of MES (200 mm), 50 μl of H2O, and 200 μl of carboxylated latex beads and gently shaken at room temperature for 15 min. Then 2 mg of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide was added to the tube, which was shaken for 2 h at room temperature. At the end of 2 h, 450 μl of glycine (1 m, pH = 6.25) were added, and the tube was shaken for an additional 30 min to terminate the reaction. The unconjugated antibodies were removed by dialyzing the reaction mixture in a dialyzing bag (molecular weight cutoff 300,000) against 1 liter of 50 mm MES (pH 6.0) overnight. The buffer was then changed to PBS by dialyzing the beads against 1 liter of PBS for another 4 h. The beads were stored at 4 oC in 1.5 ml of PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.02% azide. Because the latex microbeads used here have autofluorescence, at the end of the experiments the beads were illuminated for their fluorescence so that they would not be confused with the subcellular organelles (9Zhou X.-M. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20217-20222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The detailed microscopic procedure was previously described (9Zhou X.-M. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20217-20222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips. In some experiments, cells were incubated in 15 μg/ml C3 exoenzyme for 24 h as previously described (53Yoshioka K. Matsumura F. Aledo H. Itoh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5146-5154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Coverslips were then mounted in a steel chamber and placed on a water-jacketed heating stage on a Zeiss Axiovert 100 microscope. After the cells were spread on the poly-l-lysine-coated surface and their lamellipodia clearly defined, the anti-β2 integrin antibody-conjugated beads were added at a concentration of four to five beads per cell. PMA (100 nm), colchicine (10 μM), nocodazole, and taxol at indicated concentrations were added at the same time as the beads. Recording started as soon as the antibody-conjugated beads fell onto and bound to the cells and continued for 30 s. Although the larger latex beads may be phagocytosed by macrophages, based on vertical imaging on the confocal microscope the beads used here were not phagocytosed during the observation time, because either the beads were too small to cause phagocytic receptor aggregation or the 30-s observation time was too short. Beads coated with BSA or antibody against major histocompatibility complex II were used as controls as described previously (9Zhou X.-M. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20217-20222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Bead motion was observed using video-enhanced differential interference contrast microscopy. A charge-coupled device camera system (Optronic DE750) with digital contrast enhancement and a Pentium II 400-MHz computer with 384-MB RAM recorded the beads' motion directly into RAM at 30 frames/s. For each track, a 36-s segment was recorded using PIXCI software (Epix Inc, IL) and transferred later to the hard drive. Location of the beads was determined manually in each video frame for 15 s, i.e. 450 frames. The xy coordinates of a particle at any given time point were automatically recorded from the digitized image using a in-house written software created with Visual Basic on Window 95 platform. For each track of a bead, the mean square displacement (MSD) for each time interval was calculated from thexy coordinates of the particles according to Equations 1, 2, and 3 (for review see Ref. 43Qian H. Sheetz M.P. Elson E.L. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 910-921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar) using the same software, 2The computer software created in J.

Cells in 100-mm dishes were treated with either PMA (100 nm), taxol (20 μm), or nocodazole (5 μm) for 20 min. The cells were then lysed in 500 μl of ice-cold Tris-HCl lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.5% Triton X-100, and a mixture of protease inhibitors). Paxillin was immunoprecipitated with 2.5 μg of anti-paxillin antibody (BD Biochemicals, San Diego, CA) for 1 h at 4 oC, followed by a 1:1 mixture of 50% slurry of Protein A- and Protein G-Sepharose for 30 min at 4 °C. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to Immobilon membranes and probed with 4G10, an anti-phosphotyrosine (Upstate Biochemicals Inc., Lake Placid, NY) followed with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Later, the membrane was stripped and probed again for paxillin to show the amount of paxillin in each lane. J774 or Wehi 274.1.7 cells were cultured overnight in DMEM containing 10% FBS in Teflon beakers at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml. The cells were then treated with nocodazole, taxol, or PMA at the indicated concentrations. The aggregation of cells in the Teflon beakers was quantified as follows: After suspending cells with a gentle swirling, an aliquot of cell suspension was transferred to a hemacytometer, and unaggregated cells were counted. The cells were then subjected to vigorous pipetting to break all aggregates. An aliquot was transferred to the hemacytometer and total cells were counted. The difference was the number of cells in the aggregates. Percentage aggregation was obtained by dividing the number of aggregated cells by the number of total cells. To inhibit the aggregation with antibodies, the formed aggregates were dispersed by repeated pipetting, and the cells were resuspended in the 35-mm dishes in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS. Fab fragments of antibodies were then added to the dishes. The actin cytoskeleton is required for the cytoskeletal constraint on the molecular mobility of β2 integrin, and, thus, regulation of β2integrin mediated adhesion (8Kucik D.F. Dustin M.L. Miller J.T. Brown E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2139-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 9Zhou X.-M. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20217-20222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Here we tested whether the microtubule cytoskeleton also participates in this cytoskeletal constraint on integrin mobility. Using the MP EBV-transformed B cell line, in which it was first demonstrated that both PMA and low dose (0.1–0.3 μg/ml) cytochalasin D increase integrin mobility and activate adhesion (8Kucik D.F. Dustin M.L. Miller J.T. Brown E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2139-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), we tested the effect of microtubule depolymerization on β2 integrin mobility. SPT was used to measure diffusion of β2 integrins on MP cells before and after treatment with 10 μm colchicine. Colchicine increased the lateral mobility of β2 integrins in a manner similar to previous results with cytochalasin D. That is, mobility was increased, without a statistically significant component of directed motion (p < 0.01). This increase in random motion, illustrated in the particle tracks of Fig.1 (A and B), is consistent with a release of the β2 integrins from cytoskeletal constraints. The motion of the β2 integrins was quantified by fitting the MSD plot data (Fig. 1 C; see “Experimental Procedures”) and expressed as a diffusion coefficient (D). As can be seen in Fig. 1 D, colchicine induced a significant increase in β2 integrin mobility (p < 0.01). This confirms that, in the MP cell system, microtubules also play a role in control of integrin mobility in these cells. The molecular basis of the cytoskeletal constraints on β2 lateral mobility has been shown recently to involve MacMARCKS (9Zhou X.-M. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20217-20222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This was demonstrated in both Wehi and J774 macrophage cell lines. Because MacMARCKS binds to dynamitin, a microtubule-associated protein (31Yue L. Lu S. Garces J. Jin T. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23948-23956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we asked whether microtubules were also necessary for restriction of lateral mobility in the macrophage system. We measured the effect of microtubule depolymerization on β2 integrins in J774 cells. Furthermore, to confirm that the effects on integrin mobility (as shown in Fig. 1) were due to microtubule disruption, rather than a nonspecific effect of colchicine, we used nocodazole, another microtubule-depolymerizing reagent (47Hoebeke J. Van Nijen G. De Brabander M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 69: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), for these experiments. When nocodazole was added to J774 macrophage, we observed a concentration-dependent increase in mobility of β2 integrin (Fig. 2). The effect of nocodazole on integrin mobility reached a plateau at a concentration of 12.5 μm. At this concentration, nocodazole caused an 5.8-fold increase in integrin mobility, which was close to the previously reported effect of depolymerization of actin by cytochalasin D (8Kucik D.F. Dustin M.L. Miller J.T. Brown E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2139-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 9Zhou X.-M. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20217-20222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). As with the colchicine-treated lymphocytes, the increase in β2 integrin mobility was due to an increase in random motion. Thus, we conclude that microtubule cytoskeleton is involved in constraining integrin molecules. Because the microtubule cytoskeleton is a dynamic system, constantly undergoing polymerization and depolymerization in living cells, we also tested"

Translocation is likely to involve a series of physical interactions between the ribonucleoprotein complex and nucleoporins within the nuclear pore complex.

Tap has been implicated in the nuclear export of RNA transcripts derived from Mason-Pfizer monkey virus that contain the constitutive transport element. We demonstrate that NXT1 stimulates binding of a Tap-RNA complex to nucleoporins in vitro, and we provide mutational analysis that shows these interactions are necessary for nuclear export of an intron-containing viral mRNA in vivo. Tap contains separate domains for binding to nucleoporins and NXT1, both of which are critical for its export function. RNA export is mediated by a heterodimer of Tap and NXT1, and the function of NXT1 on this pathway is to regulate the affinity of the Tap-RNA complex for nucleoporins within the nuclear pore complex.

Receptors and cargo assemble, translocate through the NPC, and disassemble at the end of the transport reaction (1Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Substantial effort has been applied to gain an understanding of the molecular basis of these transport events, including how these events may be regulated. It is well established that components of the NPC, termed nucleoporins, are directly involved in transport. Nucleoporins, in addition to contributing to the structural architecture of the NPC, provide binding sites for receptor-cargo complexes during nuclear transport and for cargo-free receptors during recycling. Current evidence suggests that the receptor-binding sites within nucleoporins include peptide repeats that are based on the motif FXFG or GLFG, referred to as FG repeats (3Stoffler D. Fahrenkrog B.

Conceptually, these binding sites on nucleoporins could be used for the highly transient interactions expected to occur during the translocation reaction and for assembly or disassembly reactions that initiate or terminate transport, respectively. As yet, there is no evidence that transport through the NPC involves a force-producing mechanism. Rather, the cumulative work from many laboratories is consistent with nuclear transport occurring through a series of receptor-nucleoporin interactions, the directionality of which is probably determined by binding affinities. Biochemical and genetic approaches have been used to identify nuclear transport receptors in a variety of organisms. Most of the receptors studied to date are members of the β-importin superfamily (1Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar, 2Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). The founding member is β-importin (also termed β-karyopherin). β-Importin, generally with the assistance of an adapter protein termed α-importin (also termed α-karyopherin), binds nuclear localization signal-containing proteins and mediates import into the nucleus. The most thoroughly characterized export receptor, Crm1, binds directly to nuclear export signal (NES)-containing proteins and mediates their export to the cytoplasm. Certain transport pathways, however, appear to operate independently of β-importin family members. For example, nuclear export of the glucocorticoid receptor does not rely on Crm1 but instead uses calreticulin to mediate its delivery to the cytoplasm (5Holaska J.M. Black B.E. Love D.C. Hanover J.A. Leszyk J. Paschal B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Nuclear export of different classes of RNA occurs on several pathways, which reflects the use of distinct receptors and, in some cases, pathway-specific adapters or regulators. The receptor Crm1, which mediates nuclear protein export, can also mediate RNA export. This requires NES-containing adapter proteins such as Rev, which bridges the interaction between Crm1 and HIV-1 RNA. PHAX bridges the interaction between Crm1 and U1 small nuclear RNA (6Ohno M. Segref A. Bachi A. Wilm M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 2000; 101: 187-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), and Nmd3p bridges the interaction between Crm1 and the 60 S ribosomal subunit (7Ho A.K. Shen T.X. Ryan K.J. Kiseleva E. Levy M.A. Allen T.D. Wente S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5736-5748Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Nuclear export of tRNA, which does not require an adapter protein, is mediated by the β-importin superfamily member transportin-t (8Arts G.J. Fornerod M. Mattaj I.W. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 305-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Establishing the identities of receptors that are directly responsible for mRNA export has proven more difficult, perhaps because of the heterogeneous nature of the RNA cargo. Moreover, there is relatively little information on cis-acting export signals in cellular mRNAs. However, cis-acting export signals present in certain viral RNAs have been characterized extensively, and the analysis of these signals has provided general insights into RNA export mechanisms (9Hammarskjöld M.L. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 8: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The Rev response element (RRE) is a 234-nucleotide sequence within transcripts derived from HIV-1 that forms a stem-loop structure (10Daly T.J. Cook K.S. Gray G.S. Maione T.E. Rusche J.R. Nature. 1989; 342: 816-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 11Malim M.H. Hauber J. Le S.Y. Maizel J.V. Cullen B.R. Nature. 1989; 338: 254-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). The RRE provides the binding site for the viral protein Rev that, through its NES, can target the RNA for export on the Crm1 pathway (12Pollard V.W. Malim M.H. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1998; 52: 491-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). The constitutive transport element (CTE) is a 183-nucleotide sequence present in type D retroviral transcripts such as those from Mason-Pfizer Monkey virus (MPMV; see Ref. 13Bray M. Prasad S. Dubay J.W. Hunter E. Jeang K.T. Rekosh D. Hammarskjöld M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1256-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The CTE is thought to be functionally similar to the RRE, despite the lack of sequence relatedness between the two signals (14Ernst R.K. Bray M. Rekosh D. Hammarskjöld M.L. RNA (New York). 1997; 3: 210-222PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ernst R.K. Bray M. Rekosh D. Hammarskjöld M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Unlike HIV-1, the genome of MPMV does not encode an RNA-binding protein analogous to Rev. Instead, MPMV and other type D retroviruses rely on the host cell machinery to recognize the CTE and mediate transport of the CTE-containing RNA transcripts to the cytoplasm (9Hammarskjöld M.L. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 8: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The host cell factor that has been suggested to recognize and mediate nuclear export of CTE RNA is Tap (16Grüter P. Tabernero C. von Kobbe C. Schmitt C. Saavedra C. Bachi A. Wilm M. Felber B.K. Izaurralde E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 649-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). The Tap protein binds directly to the CTE through its amino-terminal domain, and microinjection or transfection of Tap promotes nuclear export of CTE-containing RNA in oocytes (16Grüter P. Tabernero C. von Kobbe C. Schmitt C. Saavedra C. Bachi A. Wilm M. Felber B.K. Izaurralde E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 649-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 17Braun I.C. Rohrbach E. Schmitt C. Izaurralde E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1953-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and in quail cells (18Kang Y. Cullen B.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1126-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). These results, together with the fact that Tap interacts with the NPC and shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm (18Kang Y. Cullen B.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1126-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 19Bear J. Tan W. Zolotukhin A.S. Tabernero C. Hudson E.A. Felber B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6306-6317Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 20Bachi A. Braun I.C. Rodrigues J.P. Panté N. Ribbeck K. von Kobbe C. Kutay U. Wilm M. Görlich D. Carmo-Fonseca M. Izaurralde E. RNA (New York). 2000; 6: 136-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), suggest that Tap may function as a receptor for RNA export. Tap activity is regulated by a nuclear export factor termed NXT1 (21Black B.E. Lévesque L. Holaska J.M. Wood T.C. Paschal B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8616-8624Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 22Katahira J. Sträßer K. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Jung J.U. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2593-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 23Kang Y. Bogerd H.P. Cullen B.R. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5863-5871Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 24Guzik B.W.

The connection between Tap and NXT1 came initially from two observations by the Hurt laboratory. First, NXT1 (also called p15) was detected as a polypeptide in a co-IP with Tap from a mammalian cell extract (22Katahira J. Sträßer K. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Jung J.U. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2593-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Second, co-expression of NXT1 and Tap was found to partially rescue growth in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain with mutations in MEX67 andMTR2, the gene products of which are required for mRNA export (22Katahira J. Sträßer K. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Jung J.U. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2593-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 25Segref A. Sharma K. Doye V. Hellwig A. Huber J. Luhrmann R. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3256-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 26Kadowaki T. Hitomi M. Chen S. Tartakoff A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We identified NXT1 based on its sequence relatedness to the nuclear import factor NTF2 and have shown that it functions on the Crm1-dependent export pathway for NES-containing proteins (21Black B.E. Lévesque L. Holaska J.M. Wood T.C. Paschal B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8616-8624Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). NXT1 binds to the Crm1 export complex and together with RanBP1 facilitates export complex disassembly and release from the cytoplasmic side of the NPC (27Black B.E. Holaska J.M. Lévesque L. Ossareh-Nazari B. Gwizdek C. Dargemont C. Paschal B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 141-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The function of NXT1 in Tap-dependent RNA export has not been defined, and its involvement in this pathway has been somewhat controversial. CTE RNA export in the oocyte can be stimulated by a mutant form of Tap with a carboxyl-terminal deletion that removes the NPC and NXT1 binding domains (17Braun I.C. Rohrbach E. Schmitt C. Izaurralde E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1953-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). A NXT1-binding mutant of Tap that contains three alanine substitutions (amino acids 415–417) can still stimulate CTE RNA export, albeit at a level that is ∼50% of the wild type (WT) Tap (23Kang Y. Bogerd H.P. Cullen B.R. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5863-5871Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In contrast to these results suggesting that NXT1 plays only a minor role in export, we found that Tap-dependent export of RNA is strongly dependent on NXT1 (24Guzik B.W. Lévesque L. Prasad S. Bor Y.-C. Black B.E. Paschal B.M. Rekosh D. Hammarskjöld M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2545-2554Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Our analysis was based on an RRE-containing reporter RNA and the nuclear export of this transcript by an export-defective mutant of Rev (RevM10) that is fused to Tap. In the context of this assay, RevM10 provides the RNA binding function and Tap provides the transport function. Co-transfection of NXT1 stimulates Tap-dependent RNA export up to 40-fold in vivo, and it is strictly dependent on a functional NXT1 binding domain in Tap (24Guzik B.W. Lévesque L. Prasad S. Bor Y.-C. Black B.E. Paschal B.M. Rekosh D. Hammarskjöld M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2545-2554Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This suggested that NXT1 is a critical co-factor for Tap-dependent RNA export. We set out to determine the function of NXT1 in Tap-dependent RNA export in mammalian cells. We found that NXT1 increases the affinity of Tap for nucleoporins up to 6-foldin vitro. This observation, together with our finding that NXT1 stimulates Tap-dependent RNA export (24Guzik B.W. Lévesque L. Prasad S. Bor Y.-C. Black B.E. Paschal B.M. Rekosh D. Hammarskjöld M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2545-2554Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), suggests that nuclear export on this pathway is directly linked to the affinity of Tap for nucleoporins within the NPC. Tap binds to p62 by both NXT1-independent and NXT1-dependent mechanisms. Both forms of binding require the carboxyl-terminal domain of Tap and correlate with the ability of Tap to mediate RNA export. A simple ribonucleoprotein complex containing Tap and CTE RNA binds to the nucleoporin p62 in a reaction that is stimulated by NXT1. Thus, NXT1 can regulate the interaction of a Tap-RNA export complex with the NPC. Recombinant NXT1 (WT or mutant) and NTF2 were expressed from pET plasmids in the BL21(DE3) strain of Escherichia coli as described previously (21Black B.E. Lévesque L. Holaska J.M. Wood T.C. Paschal B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8616-8624Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 27Black B.E. Holaska J.M. Lévesque L. Ossareh-Nazari B. Gwizdek C. Dargemont C. Paschal B.M. J.

The pGEX plasmids encoding GST-p62 and GST-p58 and the deletion derivatives GST-p58N, GST-p58M, and GST-p58C were kindly provided by Dr. Larry Gerace (29Hu T. Guan T. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 589-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The Tap cDNA (GenBankTM accession number AA173362) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the vector pGEX-4T3 plasmid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The GST fusions of nucleoporins p62 and p58, and Tap were expressed in E. coli by isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside induction and isolated on glutathione-Sepharose. The [35S]methionine-labeled proteins used in this study were prepared with the coupled transcription/translation system using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) and plasmid templates. The [35S]methionine used had a specific activity of 1175 Ci/mmol (TransLabel, ICN). The incorporation of [35S]methionine into protein was measured by filter binding to 0.45-μm HAWP nitrocellulose membranes, which was followed by extensive washing and liquid scintillation counting (LSC). Our calculation of the specific activity of [35S]methionine-labeled proteins took into account the fact that rabbit reticulocyte lysate contains 5 μmmethionine, based on the recommendation of the supplier (Promega). The Tap cDNA (GenBankTM accession number AA173362) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) that was modified to contain an amino-terminal FLAG tag. The RevM10-Tap plasmids (WT and deletion mutants) have been described (24Guzik B.W. Lévesque L. Prasad S. Bor Y.-C. Black B.E. Paschal B.M. Rekosh D. Hammarskjöld M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2545-2554Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The FLAG-NXT1 plasmid has also been described (21Black B.E. Lévesque L. Holaska J.M. Wood T.C. Paschal B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8616-8624Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Point mutations (N48E, N48K/N50K, E102N, R107A, K127A) were introduced into the FLAG-NXT1 plasmid using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. A plasmid encoding NXT1 that lacks a fusion tag was constructed by subcloning the open reading frame of mouse NXT1 into the mammalian expression vector pSVK3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The [32P]UTP- and [32P]GTP-labeled CTE RNAs were synthesized using pGEM-based templates and T7 polymerase. The WT CTE (pGEM7zfCTEwt) and M2/M11 mutant CTE (pGEM7zfCTEM2/M11) plasmids (30Pasquinelli A.E. Ernst R.K. Lund E. Grimm C. Zapp M.L. Rekosh D. Hammarskjöld M.L. Dahlberg J.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7500-7510Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) were linearized with BamHI, and the GAC mutant CTE (pGEM3zfCTEM2) plasmid (18Kang Y. Cullen B.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1126-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) was linearized with XbaI. The transcription reactions contained [α-32P]UTP (ICN) or [α-32P]GTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with a specific activity of 800 Ci/mmol and unlabeled dNTPs (Promega). Radiolabeled RNA was heat-denatured at 93 °C for 3 min, fractionated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea, and isolated by the crush and soak method. Renatured RNA was analyzed on 6% native polyacrylamide gels prior to use in binding assays. The plasmid encoding the GAC mutant (mutGAC) of the CTE was kindly provided by Dr. Bryan Cullen. NXT1 binding to Tap was examined by co-immunoprecipitation (IP) of [35S]methionine-labeled proteins out of rabbit reticulocyte lysate. FLAG-Tap and untagged NXT1 (WT and mutant) were synthesized separately as [35S]methionine-labeled proteins. Each binding reaction (20 μl total volume) contained 2 μl of lysate from the in vitro transcription/translation reactions, bovine serum albumin (BSA, 0.1 mg/ml), aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin (each at 2 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm), and dithiothreitol (2 mm) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.76 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4). The binding reactions were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C prior to the addition of antibodies. For IP, the FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 was immobilized on protein G beads (both from Sigma) at a concentration of 0.2 μg of antibody per μl of packed beads. The antibody beads were mixed with the binding reaction overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed six times with PBS containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The proteins bound by the FLAG antibody were eluted by boiling the beads with SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and visualized by autoradiography. For the GST pull-down assays, the lysates were diluted as above and mixed with GST or GST-p62 immobilized on glutathione beads (20 μl of beads containing 10 μg of protein) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed and processed as described for the IP analysis. In the case of the RNA co-IP experiments, the reactions also contained32P-labeled RNA (4.3 × 105 cpm/binding reaction), unlabeled tRNA (20 μg/ml), and ribonuclease inhibitor (10 units/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.), GST-Tap (400 ng) or GST (5 μg). Levels of precipitated 32P-CTE RNA were quantitated by LSC. The solid phase binding assays were performed essentially as described (21Black B.E. Lévesque L. Holaska J.M. Wood T.C. Paschal B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8616-8624Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The GST fusion proteins (∼30 nm final concentration) were diluted into transport buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 110 mmpotassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mmEGTA) and adsorbed to the wells (100 μl/well) of high capacity protein-binding 96-well plates (Costar catalog number 3590) for 24 h at 4 °C. The wells were then blocked with 3% BSA (300 μl) for 24 h at 4 °C. The input for the binding reactions were assembled in microcentrifuge tubes and contained the [35S]methionine-labeled FLAG-Tap (∼105cpm/well), 0.5% BSA, 0.2% Tween 20, and 2 mmdithiothreitol in transport buffer, in the presence or absence of recombinant NXT1 or NTF2. For RNA-binding experiments, the reactions also contained 32P-labeled RNA (∼104cpm/well), unlabeled tRNA (14 μg/ml), and ribonuclease inhibitor (14.3 units/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.). After binding for 24 h at 4 °C, the wells were washed three times in 0.5× transport buffer containing 0.2% Tween 20, and eluted with 5% SDS (200 μl) for 30 min at room temperature. The level of [35S]methionine-labeled FLAG-Tap and [32P]UTP-labeled RNA was measured by LSC in separate channels. We determined that 30% of counts from 32P appear in the window for 35S (data not shown), making it necessary to correct for 35S-protein binding. In assays using only recombinant factors, GST-Tap (140 ng/well) was used instead of reticulocyte lysate-translated FLAG-Tap, and soluble GST (400 ng/well) was added to all binding reactions. HeLa cells expressing FLAG-NXT1 (21Black B.E. Lévesque L. Holaska J.M. Wood T.C. Paschal B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8616-8624Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) or FLAG-Tap grown on glass coverslips were used for immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy. HeLa cells expressing FLAG-Tap were generated by electroporation and processed for IF 48 h post-transfection. For selective detection of NXT1 and Tap on the cytoplasmic side of the NPC, the cells were treated with 0.005% digitonin in transport buffer for 6 min on ice, washed in transport buffer, fixed in 2% formaldehyde, and processed for IF without further permeabilization as described by Blacket al. (21Black B.E. Lévesque L. Holaska J.M. Wood T.C. Paschal B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8616-8624Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The antibodies used were the anti-FLAG monoclonal M2 (1:5000, Sigma) followed by a Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse (1:800, The Jackson Laboratories) and the nucleoporin antibody RL1 (1:100, see Ref. 31Snow C.M. Senior A. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1143-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) followed by rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgM (1:200, Pierce). Epifluorescence images were captured digitally on a Nikon microphot SA microscope and processed using Adobe Photoshop (version 5.5). The RL1 antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Larry Gerace. The methods used for immunoelectron microscopy (immuno-EM) localization have been described (32Guan T. Müller S. Klier G. Panté N. Blevitt J.M. Haner M. Paschal B. Aebi U. Gerace L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1591-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The average distribution of NXT1 was determined by measuring the distance between gold particles and the central plane of the NPC. The methods used to assay RNA export in 293T/17 cells were recently described in detail (24Guzik B.W. Lévesque L. Prasad S. Bor Y.-C. Black B.E. Paschal B.M. Rekosh D. Hammarskjöld M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2545-2554Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The assay measures nuclear export of a transcript encoding the HIV-1 capsid protein p24 (33Srinivasakumar N. Chazal N. Helga-Maria C. Prasad S. Hammarskjöld M.L. Rekosh D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5841-5848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the expression of which is quantitated using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Nuclear export of the HIV-1 transcript is dependent on the functional interaction between RevM10-Tap and NXT1, both introduced by transfection (24Guzik B.W. Lévesque L. Prasad S. Bor Y.-C. Black B.E. Paschal B.M. Rekosh D. Hammarskjöld M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2545-2554Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The plasmids encoding p24 (pCMVgagpol-RRE), Tap fusions (RevM10-Tap, FLAG-RevM10-Tap, and deletion derivatives), and secreted alkaline phosphatase (pCMV-SEAP) have been described (24Guzik B.W. Lévesque L. Prasad S. Bor Y.-C. Black B.E. Paschal B.M. Rekosh D. Hammarskjöld M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2545-2554Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A FLAG-NTF2 plasmid was used as one of the transfection controls and has been described previously (34Steggerda S.M. Black B.E. Paschal B.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 703-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The activities of WT and mutant NXT1 proteins were measured in the RNA export assay by co-transfection of FLAG-tagged plasmids described above. Immunoblotting was used to verify that similar levels of WT and mutant NXT1 proteins were expressed in the transfected cells. Previous work (21Black B.E. Lévesque L. Holaska J.M. Wood T.C. Paschal B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8616-8624Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 22Katahira J. Sträßer K. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Jung J.U. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2593-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) has established that NXT1 localizes to both the nucleoplasm and the NPC, and similar results have been obtained with Tap (19Bear J. Tan W. Zolotukhin A.S. Tabernero C. Hudson E.A. Felber B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6306-6317Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 20Bachi A. Braun I.C. Rodrigues J.P. Panté N. Ribbeck K. von Kobbe C. Kutay U. Wilm M. Görlich D. Carmo-Fonseca M. Izaurralde E. RNA (New York). 2000; 6: 136-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). To determine whether NXT1 and Tap are associated specifically with the cytoplasmic face of the NPC, HeLa cells expressing FLAG-NXT1 or FLAG-Tap were treated with a concentration of digitonin that permeabilizes the plasma membrane and leaves the nuclear membrane intact. Following a brief fixation, we processed the cells for IF microscopy using anti-FLAG antibody to detect transfected NXT1 or Tap and RL1 antibody to detect NPCs. Under these conditions, the primary and secondary antibodies have access to the cytoplasmic compartment but not to the nucleoplasmic compartment (27Black B.E. Holaska J.M. Lévesque L. Ossareh-Nazari B. Gwizdek C. Dargemont C. Paschal B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 141-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We observed a punctate distribution of NXT1 and Tap on the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear envelope that was very similar to the distribution of NPCs detected with RL1 (Fig. 1 A). Thus, under steady state conditions, NXT1 and Tap are localized to the cytoplasmic side of the NPC. We examined the subcellular distribution of NXT1 using immuno-EM. The FLAG-NXT1 cell line was processed for immuno-EM using the anti-FLAG primary and 10 nm gold-labeled secondary antibodies. NXT1 localized to both the cytoplasmic and nuclear sides of the NPC (Fig. 1 B). We quantitated the distribution of NXT1 by measuring the distance between individual gold particles and the central plane of the NPC. This analysis revealed that NXT1 localizes ∼40 nm from the central plane of the NPC on both sides of the pore (Fig. 1, C andD). The interaction of Tap with the NPC is predicted to be fundamental for its role in mediating translocation of RNA substrates through the pore. Deletion mutants of Tap, analyzed by subcellular localization and binding experiments using individual nucleoporins, have implicated the carboxyl-terminal ∼100 amino acids (residues 508–619) as important for interactions with the NPC (19Bear J.

Here we trace the hypocholesterolemic activity of LY295427 to an ability to reverse oxysterol-mediated suppression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) processing. Micromolar concentrations of LY295427 induced the metabolism of LDL in oxysterol-treated cultured cells and inhibited the stimulation of cholesteryl ester synthesis mediated by oxysterols. cDNA microarray and RNA blotting experiments revealed that LY295427 increased levels of the LDL receptor mRNA and those of other SREBP target genes. The compound stimulated the accumulation of SREBPs in the nuclei of cells grown in the presence of oxysterols within 4–6 h of addition to the medium. Induction required components of the normal SREBP-processing pathway, including the SREBP cleavage-activating protein and the Site 1 protease. LY295427 overcame the suppression of SREBP processing mediated by several oxysterols but not by LDL-derived cholesterol.

Ericsson J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 157-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Suppression is mediated by decreasing the production of active sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs),2 transcription factors that are required for the expression of genes in the cholesterol supply pathways (2Brown M.S.

A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar). In the presence of excess sterols, SREBP is maintained as an inactive precursor in the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and transcription from supply pathway genes is low. Sterol loss activates a processing pathway in which the SREBP precursor is transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus and therein cleaved by proteases to release the amino-terminal half of the protein from the membrane-bound precursor. The cleaved protein migrates to the nucleus and activates the transcription of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene and genes encoding enzymes in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, leading to increased cellular cholesterol.cDNAs and genes encoding proteins that participate in this complex mechanism of feedback regulation have been identified recently. These include DNAs encoding two closely related SREBPs (1 and 2) (4Yokoyama C. Wang X. Briggs M.R. Admon A. Wu J. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S.

All of these proteins are tightly associated with the membranes of the cell, presumably to allow close monitoring of and response to fluctuations in the levels of bilayer sterols.It has been known for many years that oxysterols are far more potent than cholesterol in exerting negative feedback regulation on the sterol biosynthetic and uptake pathways (11Kandutsch A.A. Chen H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6057-6061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7306-7314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When dissolved in ethanol and added to the medium of cultured cells at concentrations of less than 1 μm, the oxysterols 25-hydroxycholesterol or 27-hydroxycholesterol inhibit the proteolysis of SREBP precursors, which in turn suppresses the synthesis of cholesterol and the uptake of LDL cholesterol via the LDL receptor. In contrast, the addition of cholesterol in ethanol causes at best only modest suppression. The mechanisms by which oxysterols mediate their potency have not been defined, nor has it proven straightforward to determine whether oxysterols play a regulatory role in the whole animal. Although several enzymes that synthesize (13Russell D.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 126-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and degrade (14Schwarz M. Lund E.G. Lathe R.

(16Lin H.-S. Rampersaud A.A. Archer R.A. Pawlak J.M. Beavers L.S. Schmidt R.J. Kauffman R.F. Bensch W.R. Bumol T.F. Apelgren L.D. Eacho P.J. Perry D.N. McClure D.B. Gadski R.A. J. Med.

Steroids. 1999; 64: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) exploited the potency of oxysterols and knowledge of the feedback regulation of cholesterol metabolism to identify small molecules that modulate the system. To this end, libraries of compounds were screened using an assay that detected the reversal of oxysterol-mediated suppression of a human LDL receptor promoter reporter gene. Among the active compounds identified was the sterol LY295427 (Fig.1), which had an EC50 value in the low micromolar range. The closely related compound LY306309, differing only in the stereochemistry at carbon 3 (Fig. 1), was inactive. When administered to cholesterol-fed hamsters, LY295427 reduced plasma LDL levels by as much as 69% (18Bensch W.R. Gadski R.A. Bean J.S. Beavers L.S. Schmidt R.J. Perry D.N. Murphy A.T. McClure D.B. Eacho P.I. Breau A.P. Archer R.A. Kauffman R.F. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 289: 85-92PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments with cultured cells and liver extracts prepared from treated hamsters indicated that LY295427 increased the levels of unidentified oxysterol-binding proteins (19Bowling N. Matter W.F. Gadski R.A. McClure D.B. Schreyer T. Dawson P.A. Vlahos C.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2586-2598PubMed Google Scholar); however, the relationship between these findings and the decrease in serum cholesterol levels was not elucidated.In the current studies we show that LY295427 reverses the oxysterol-mediated suppression of SREBP processing in cultured cells. The consequences of this reversal are the activation of multiple SREBP-responsive genes, including the LDL receptor gene, and a concomitant increase in the metabolism of LDL, thus explaining the hypocholesterolemic effects of the compound. When considered with thein vivo activity of LY295427, these findings support a role for oxysterols in the regulation of cholesterol metabolism in the whole animal.RESULTSThe consequences of LY295427 treatment for cellular cholesterol metabolism were determined by treating diploid human fibroblasts with 30 μm compound for 48 h and then measuring the binding, uptake, and degradation of [125I]LDL (TableI). In two separate experiments, cells grown in lipoprotein-deficient medium, conditions that result in the induction of LDL receptor expression, metabolized microgram amounts of LDL. The quantity of LDL metabolized in this medium was not altered by treatment with LY295427. Cells grown in the presence of a mixture of sterols (5 μg/ml cholesterol and 0.4 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol) metabolized far less LDL because of oxysterol-mediated suppression of LDL receptor expression. Incubation of the sterol-treated cells with LY295427, however, completely restored the metabolism of LDL to levels observed in cells grown without sterols (Table I). When LDL or FCS were present in the medium, the amount of [125I]LDL metabolized was reduced, again via sterol-mediated suppression of LDL receptor expression, but LY295427 did not reverse this suppression (Table I).Table IEffects of LY295427 on LDL metabolism in human fibroblastsTreatment[125I]LDLBindingInternalizationDegradationng/4 h/mg cell proteinExperiment A None1085723433 LY2954271217434054 Sterols562691320 Sterols + LY2954271036493257 LDL2281378 LDL + LY29542717137522Experiment B None14910215233 LY29542713412354941 Sterols43241786 Sterols + LY2954271518974428 FCS27212650 FCS + LY29542747336908Human diploid fibroblasts were plated on day 0 at a density of 2 × 104 cells/6-cm dish in DMEM containing 10% (v/v) FCS. On day 2 the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM containing 10% (v/v) FCS. On day 5, the medium was removed, the cells were washed once with PBS, and fresh DMEM medium containing 10% (v/v) HLPPS supplemented with 30 μm LY295427, 0.4 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol plus 5 μg/ml cholesterol (Sterols), 10 μg/ml LDL, or 10% (v/v) FCS as indicated, were added to the dishes. On day 7, the medium was removed, the cells were washed once with PBS, and DMEM containing 2 mg/ml BSA, the supplements described above, and 10 μg/ml [125I]LDL were added as indicated. The binding, uptake, and degradation of [125I]LDL were measured after a 4-h incubation as described (21Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). The numbers shown (means of triplicate determinations) represent high affinity values, which were calculated by subtracting the values obtained in the presence of excess unlabeled LDL (500 μg/ml) from those obtained in the absence of unlabeled LDL.

Casey M.L. Goldstein J.L. Russell D.W. Cell. 1984; 39: 27-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). To establish whether LY295427 could overcome this suppression, SV589 cells were cultured in the presence and absence of sterols and the compound, and levels of LDL receptor mRNA were assessed by blotting (Fig. 2). SV589 cells grown in lipoprotein-deficient medium contained substantial amounts of LDL receptor mRNA (lane 1). As expected, the presence of sterols in the medium decreased the level of LDL receptor mRNA (lane 2). The addition of LY295427 in the absence of sterols did not alter levels of LDL receptor mRNA in cells grown in lipoprotein-deficient medium (lane 3); however, the addition of the compound in the presence of sterols completely prevented the suppression of this mRNA (lane 4). Under none of the examined conditions did levels of the cyclophilin mRNA change in these cells (Fig. 3).Figure 2Induction of LDL receptor mRNA by LY295427 in immortalized human fibroblasts.

RNA was prepared from cells grown in medium with sterols ± LY295427 and then converted into cDNA in the presence of a deoxynucleoside triphosphate derivatized with a fluorescent dye. Different dyes were used to label the minus and plus compound cDNA probes, which were subsequently hybridized to two different microarrays containing 8,000–10,000 human cDNAs. Changes in gene expression were measured by fluorescence spectroscopy, and the data were organized according to rank order differences in the levels of a given mRNA. As summarized in TableII, the 15 genes whose expression changed the most under these conditions were all involved in sterol or fatty acid metabolism. For example, the expression of the gene encoding stearoyl-CoA desaturase was induced 6–7-fold in SV589 cells grown in the presence of sterols plus LY295427 versus levels found in cells cultured in sterols minus LY295427. Other mRNAs, such as that encoding farnesyl diphosphate synthetase, were elevated by growth in the presence of LY295427 but to a lesser extent (1.8 to 2.1-fold; TableII).Table IIIdentification of mRNAs with increased expression after LY295427 treatment of human SV589 cellsGeneFunctionFold increaseGenBank™ accession numberExperiment 1Experiment 2Stearoyl-CoA desaturaseFatty acid biosynthesis7.36.5AB032261Methyl sterol oxidaseCholesterol biosynthesis6.9NDAA157955Isopentenyl diphosphate isomeraseCholesterol biosynthesis6.6NDH08899Farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferaseCholesterol biosynthesis5.43.1X69141Mevalonate kinaseCholesterol biosynthesis4.91.5X753113-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductaseCholesterol biosynthesis4.53.0H16650Squalene epoxidaseCholesterol biosynthesis3.72.6AF098865LDL receptorCholesterol supplyND3.0NM_0005277-Dehydro-cholesterol ▵7-reductaseCholesterol biosynthesisND3.0BE378962Mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylaseCholesterol biosynthesis2.82.3U49260ATP citrate lyaseLipid biosynthesis2.31.4AW967351SREBP-2Transcription of lipid metabolism genesND1.9AA608556Isopentenyl-diphosphate δ-isomeraseCholesterol biosynthesisND1.9X17025Farnesyl diphosphate synthaseCholesterol biosynthesis2.11.8D14697Sterol C4-methyl oxidaseCholesterol biosynthesisND1.7NM_006745In Experiment 1, poly(A)+ mRNA isolated from SV589 cells grown in medium E supplemented with 1 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol ± 20 μm LY295427 was subjected to hybridization analyses using a human microarray representing 10,000 cDNAs (Incyte Genomics, St. Louis, MO) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In Experiment 2, the same SV589 poly(A)+ mRNA was subjected to hybridization analysis except that a custom cDNA chip arrayed at Tularik, Inc was used.

Open table in a new tab These results were confirmed and extended in a series of RNA blotting experiments carried out in SV589 cells grown in the presence of sterols and LY295427 for different lengths of time. As shown by the data in Fig. 3, mRNA levels for the LDL receptor, SREBP-2, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase, three genes identified in the cDNA array experiments, were low in cells grown in the presence of sterols. The amounts of these mRNAs began to increase 6 h after the addition of LY295427 to the sterol-containing medium, and they reached maximal levels at 24 h. In contrast, the levels of an mRNA transcribed from the cyclophilin gene, which is not sterol-responsive, remained unchanged throughout the time course of the experiment (Fig. 3).A majority of the genes whose expression was altered by LY295427 were targets of the SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 transcription factors (30Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1999; 10: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), suggesting that the compound in some manner affected the activity of these DNA-binding proteins. To test this hypothesis, we monitored the processing of SREBPs in CHO-7 cells treated with LY295427. When grown in the absence of sterols, CHO-7 cells contained ample amounts of both SREBP-1 and -2 precursor and mature forms (Fig.4, lanes 1 and 5). Conversely, when grown in the presence of sterols, CHO-7 cells contained the membrane-bound precursor but little or no nuclear SREBP (lanes 2 and 6). The addition of LY295427 did not affect levels of the SREBP precursors or their processed nuclear forms in cells grown in the absence of sterols (lanes 3 and7), but it completely prevented the decrease in the nuclear forms normally observed in the presence of sterols (lanes 4and 8).Figure 4LY296427 reverses sterol-mediated suppression of SREBP processing in CHO-7 cells. On day 0, the cells were set up as described under “Experimental Procedures.” On day 2, cells were refed medium C supplemented with vehicle (lanes 1 and5), sterols (1 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol and 10 μg/ml cholesterol, lanes 2 and 6), 20 μmLY295427 (lanes 3 and 7), or LY295427 and sterols (lanes 4 and 8). The cells were harvested after 24 h, and fractions enriched in membrane and nuclear proteins were prepared by centrifugation. Aliquots of protein (40–65 μg) from each fraction were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nylon membrane, and incubated with 5 μg/ml rabbit anti-hamster SREBP-1 IgG-179 (lanes 1–4) or 5 μg/ml mouse anti-hamster SREBP-2 IgG-7D4 (lanes 5–8).

The data of Fig. 5 showed that as the concentration of this oxysterol was increased from 0 to 5 μg/ml there was a progressive decrease in the amount of SREBP-2 in the nuclear fraction. This decrease was prevented by inclusion of 20 μm LY295427 in the culture medium. The addition of LDL to the medium at concentrations ranging from 5 to 100 μg/ml also suppressed the processing of SREBP-2; however, LY295427 did not reverse this suppression (Fig. 5). The levels of the LDL receptor and HMG-CoA synthase mRNAs were monitored in this same experiment, and these correlated directly with the amounts of SREBP-2 present in each condition (data not shown). These results agreed with those presented in Table I and indicated that LY295427 reversed the inhibition of SREBP processing mediated by oxysterols but not by LDL.Figure 5LY295427 reverses oxysterol- but not LDL-mediated suppression of SREBP processing. Human SV589 cells were plated on day 0 of the experiment as described under “Experimental Procedures.” On day 1, the cells were refed medium E supplemented with 25-hydroxycholesterol (0.2–5.0 μg/ml, upper panels), LDL (5–100 μg/ml, lower panels), and 20 μm LY295427 as indicated. On day 2, the cells were harvested, a fraction enriched in nuclear proteins was prepared by differential centrifugation, and aliquots containing 80 μg of protein were analyzed by immunoblotting with a mouse monoclonal antibody (IgG-1D2) that recognized SREBP-2. Immune complexes were detected subsequently by chemiluminescence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The hydrolysis of cellular sphingomyelin by the enzyme sphingomyelinase triggers the movement of cholesterol from the plasma membrane to the endoplasmic reticulum, which in turn causes suppression of SREBP processing (27Scheek S.

To determine whether LY295427 could reverse this suppression, CHO-7 cells were treated with different concentrations of sphingomyelinase in the presence or absence of 20 μmcompound and SREBP-2 processing was followed in cell lysates (Fig.6). Suppression was observed when the level of sphingomyelinase exceeded 100 milliunits/ml (lanes 1–4), and the inclusion of LY295427 in the culture medium had no effect on this regulation (lanes 5–8).Figure 6LY295427 does not reverse suppression of SREBP processing caused by sphingomyelinase. CHO-7 cells were plated on day 0 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The medium was removed on day 2, the cells were washed twice with PBS, and fresh medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml of an acylcholesterol acyl transferase inhibitor (Sandoz 58–035) and 20 μm LY295427 (as indicated) was added. After 30 min, sphingomyelinase was added to the medium at the indicated concentrations, and the incubation continued for 90 min. The cells were harvested, lysed with a buffer containing SDS, and aliquots (50 μg) of the resulting lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting.

To determine whether the ability of LY295427 to facilitate SREBP processing in the presence of sterols also required these proteins, the effect of the compound in CHO-7 cell lines lacking SCAP or the Site 1 protease was assessed (Fig.7). In control experiments, wild type CHO-7 cells grown in the presence of sterols contained only the SREBP-2 precursor (lane 1). The processing of this form to the active nuclear protein was induced when LY295427 was added to the sterol-containing medium (lane 2). In a line of CHO-7 cells deficient in SCAP (SRD13A cells), no SREBP-2 proteins or peptides were detected, regardless of the presence or absence of sterols or LY295427 (lanes 3–6). The absence of SCAP chaperone activity renders SREBP unstable in SRD13A cells (23Rawson R.B. DeBose-Boyd R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

CHO-7 cells deficient in the Site 1 protease (SRD12B cells) contained the precursor form of SREBP-2 when cultured in the presence of sterols (lane 8), and, as expected, these cells were unable to cleave the precursor into the active form when sterols were removed from the medium (lane 7). LY295427 was unable to induce SREBP cleavage when these cells were grown in the presence or absence of sterols (lanes 9 and 10). In no cell line was the level of a control protein (immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein) changed (Fig. 7, lower panel). Similar results were obtained when the processing of SREBP-1 was followed (data not shown). Together these data indicated that the cleavage of SREBP in the presence of sterols and LY295427 involved two of the same components that process the protein in the absence of sterols.Figure 7LY295427 action requires an intact SREBP processing system. On day 0, CHO-7, SRD-12B, or SRD-13A cells were set up as described under “Experimental Procedures.” On day 2, the cells were refed medium C supplemented with vehicle (ethanol), sterols (1 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol and 10 μg/ml cholesterol), or sterols plus 20 μm LY295427, as indicated, for 24 h. The cells were harvested and lysed with a buffer containing SDS, and aliquots (80 μg) of the resulting lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. Precursor (P) and mature (M) forms of SREBP-2 were detected with a mouse anti-hamster SREBP-2 monoclonal antibody (IgG-7D4) and a chemiluminescent system. Signals were removed from the blot, and the filter was subjected to a second round of immunoblotting using a rabbit anti-rat immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein (BIP) antibody to confirm that equal amounts of protein were analyzed in each lane (lower panel). Lumigrams were generated by exposing the treated filters to x-ray film for 5–15 s.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Dose-response experiments indicated that micromolar concentrations of LY295427 were needed to reverse the suppressive effects of oxysterols on SREBP processing in SV589 cells (Fig.8). An increase in the nuclear form of SREBP-2 was first detected at 5 μm LY295427 (lane 4). Enhanced production of processed SREBP-2 correlated with the increase of LY295427 up to 60 μm (lanes 5–8), which represented the solubility limit of the compound. In marked contrast, 60 μm LY306039, the 3β-stereoisomer of LY295427, did not affect SREBP-2 processing (Fig. 8, lane 9).Figure 8Dose-response experiment to determine effective concentration of LY2954"

Nevertheless, the mechanisms permitting such large variations in ATP synthesis capacity, as well as the consequence on the overall efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation, are not known. By investigating several physiological models in vivo in rats (hyper- and hypothyroidism, polyunsaturated fatty acid deficiency, and chronic ethanol intoxication) we found that the increase in hepatocyte respiration (from 9.8 to 22.7 nmol of O2/min/mg dry cells) was tightly correlated with total mitochondrial cytochrome content, expressed both per mg dry cells or per mg mitochondrial protein. Moreover, this increase in total cytochrome content was accompanied by an increase in the respective proportion of cytochrome oxidase; while total cytochrome content increased 2-fold (from 0.341 ± 0.021 to 0.821 ± 0.024 nmol/mg protein), cytochrome oxidase increased 10-fold (from 0.020 ± 0.002 to 0.224 ± 0.006 nmol/mg protein). This modification was associated with a decrease in the overall efficiency of the respiratory chain. Since cytochrome oxidase is well recognized for slippage between redox reactions and proton pumping, we suggest that this dramatic increase in cytochrome oxidase is responsible for the decrease in the overall efficiency of respiratory chain and, in turn, of ATP synthesis yield, linked to the adaptive increase in oxidative phosphorylation capacity.

In contrast to short-term adaptation, which relies only on a flux modulation through every functional unit of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, chronic adaptation to various rates of ATP utilization can also be achieved by modifying the number of these functional units (mitogenesis). Indeed, in the light of the large physiological variations in ATP turnover observed in living systems, it is highly probable that the amount of enzymes involved in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway plays a significant role. Recently the trade-off between rate and yield of ATP synthesis in heterotrophic organisms has been highlighted as a possible major mechanism of cooperation and competition involved in the evolutionary aspects of energy metabolism (1Pfeiffer T. Schuster S. Bonhoeffer S. Science. 2001; 292: 504-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). By investigating the effect on the yield of ATP synthesis (ATP/O)1 after acute modulations of the flux through the oxidative phosphorylation pathway in yeast mitochondria, it has been shown that the decrease in flux was accompanied by an increase in efficiency when the flux was limited by substrate supply (2Fitton V. Rigoulet M. Ouhabi R. Guerin B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9692-9698Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 3Ouhabi R. Rigoulet M. Guérin B.

Conversely, no change in ATP/O was observed when the oxidative phosphorylation flux was modulated by the inhibition of ATP synthesis (oligomycin) (2Fitton V. Rigoulet M. Ouhabi R. Guerin B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9692-9698Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 3Ouhabi R. Rigoulet M. Guérin B. FEBS Lett. 1989; 254: 199-202Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 4Rigoulet M. Leverve X. Fontaine E. Ouhabi R. Guérin B. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 184: 35-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, depending on the mechanism permitting to modulate the flux through the respiratory chain, different consequences on the efficiency of this pathway were observed (4Rigoulet M. Leverve X. Fontaine E. Ouhabi R. Guérin B. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 184: 35-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to these clear effects on oxidative phosphorylation efficiency following acute modulations of the flux in vitro, the consequence of chronic adaptation to various rates of ATP turnover on the yield of ATP synthesis in vivo is not known since the mechanism permitting such adaptation is poorly understood as yet. This issue, however, is of major importance since a large disparity in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation activity is encountered between species, tissues, and in a given tissue according to physiological or pathological states. Indeed, if a change in the rate of oxidative phosphorylation pathway also affects its yield, a compromise between flux and efficiency must be achieved, and one main question pertains to the mechanism and the cost permitting such large changes in oxidative phosphorylation capacity. In this work, we have studied the parameters of oxidative phosphorylation in isolated liver cells and liver mitochondria from rats subject to various physiological or pathological conditions known to affect oxidative phosphorylation: thyroid status (5Bobyleva V.

Hypothyroidy was obtained by adjunction of propylthiouracil, an inhibitor of the first step of thyroid hormone synthesis, in drinking water. We observed that the respiratory rates of isolated liver cells from these models varied from 9.8 to 22.7 nmol/min/mg dry cells, while maximal mitochondrial ATP synthesis capacity varied from 165 to 382 nmol/min/mg protein. These events were related to ATPase activity as well as cytochrome, ANC, and Pi carrier contents. The activation of oxidative phosphorylation rate was accompanied by a decrease in ATP/O ratio and was associated to a change in the composition of the respiratory chain since the proportion of cytochrome oxidase varied from 6% to 27% of total cytochrome content. Because cytochrome oxidase is well recognized to be the location of a slippage between redox reaction and proton pumping (2Fitton V. Rigoulet M. Ouhabi R. Guerin B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9692-9698Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 20–33) we propose the change in the proportion of cytochrome oxidase to be the major determinant of the modulation of oxidative phosphorylation in these physiological adaptive processes. Male weaning Wistar rats were divided into five groups: control, polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-deficient, hyperthyroid, hypothyroid, and alcohol. Rats were fed for 6 weeks a semi-synthetic diet containing 72% of energy as carbohydrate, 22% as protein, and 6% as lipid (soya oil). In the PUFA-deficient group, this diet was supplemented with stearic and palmitic acid (3% of energy for each) instead of soya oil. Hyperthyroidy was induced by daily intraperitoneal injections of 3,3′,5-triiodo-l-thyronine (15 μg/100 g of body weight in 0.05 m NaOH in saline) for 10 days before killing. In the hypothyroid group, 0.05% (w/v) 6-n-propyl-2-thiouracil was given in drinking water for 6 weeks. In the ethanol group, ethanol was given in drinking water with progressively increasing concentrations from 5 to 30% during the 6 weeks (5% increase every week). Hepatocytes were isolated by the method of Berry and Friend (34Berry M.N. Friend D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 43: 506-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (3601) Google Scholar) as modified by Groen et al. (35Groen A.K. Sips H.J. Vervoorn R.C. Tager J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 122: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), from rats fasted for 24 h. Liver cells (15 mg dry cells/ml) were incubated with 20 mm glucose as substrate. After a 25-min incubation, myxothiazol-sensitive oxygen consumption was measured, permitting to consider only mitochondrial respiration since myxothiazol is an inhibitor of complex III. Cell and mitochondrial matrix volumes were determined by subtracting either [14C]carboxymethylinulin or [14C]mannitol spaces, respectively, from the water space determined by 3H2O as described in (36Espié P. Guérin B. Rigoulet M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1230: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial and cytosolic membrane electrical potential difference (ΔΨ) measurements in intact cells were performed using the equilibrium distribution of [3H]TPMP+ and36Cl−, respectively (36Espié P. Guérin B. Rigoulet M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1230: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The intramitochondrial NADH/NAD+ ratio was determined by the metabolite indicator method (37Akerboom T.P.M. van der Meer R. Tager J.M. Tech. Metab. Res. B. 1979; 105: 1-33Google Scholar) assuming the reaction catalyzed by β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.30) is in near equilibrium.K app = [acetoacetic acid] × [NADH]/[β-hydroxybutyric acid] × [NAD+],i.e. 4.93 × 10−2 (38Williamson D.H. Lund P. Krebs H.A. Biochem. J. 1967; 103: 514-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). ΔE′ h represents the span of the redox potential between the electron donor couple (NADH/NAD+) and the final electron acceptor couple (O/H2O) across the respiratory chain. It was calculated from ΔE′ h = −ΔE°′ h − 61.5log([NADH]/[NAD +] with ΔE°′ h = 1.2 volt. The overall efficiency of the respiratory chain was estimated by investigating the relationship between the rate through the global reaction (oxygen consumption) and the overall thermodynamic driving force applied to this reaction and expressed as 2ΔE′ h − nΔΨ, where ΔE′ h is the difference in redox potential across the respiratory chain (see above), and n is the H+/O stoichiometry of the overall respiratory chain. It is accepted that n is equal to 10 for substrates giving their electrons to complex I (36Espié P. Guérin B. Rigoulet M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1230: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 39Stoner C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10445-10453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The relationship between the rate of oxygen consumption and the overall thermodynamic driving force was established experimentally by modulating the ΔΨ in intact cells with small additions of DNP (20–75 μm). Mitochondria were isolated from liver of freshly killed rats by the standard method (40Klingenberg M. Slenczka W. Biochem. Z. 1959; 331: 486-495PubMed Google Scholar). They were incubated at a concentration of 4 mg/ml in an oxygraph vessel equipped with a Clark electrode at 37 °C in a medium containing 125 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm Pi-Tris, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) in the presence of 5 mm succinate-Tris, 0.5 mm malate-Tris, and 1.25 μm rotenone. After the addition of 1 mm ADP, mitochondrial oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis rates were measured. These conditions permitted to determine ATP/O at maximal state 3 respiratory rate. In a parallel experiment, oligomycin (1.25 μg/mg protein) was added to the mitochondrial suspension to determine the non-phosphorylating respiratory rate (state 4). Cytochrome concentrations in the mitochondrial respiratory chain were measured in parallel experiments at 25 °C by comparing the spectra of fully oxidized (2 μl of H2O2)versus fully reduced (few crystals of sodium dithionite) cytochrome. Respiratory chain cytochrome concentrations were also determined similarly in isolated hepatocytes. Wavelength pairs and absorptivity coefficients used were: cytochrome c +c 1 (550–540 nm) ε = 18 mm−1 cm−1, cytochromeb (563–575 nm) ε = 18 mm−1cm−1, and cytochrome a +a 3 (605–630 nm) ε = 24 mm−1 cm−1 (41Vanneste W.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 113: 175-182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Ohnishi T. Kawagushi K. Hagihara B. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 797-806Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Determination of phosphate and adenine nucleotide carriers content was assessed in rat liver mitochondria in a medium containing 125 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mmTris-Pi, and 1 mm ADP with 5 mmsuccinate as respiratory substrate and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2, 37 °C). By titrating the state 3 respiratory rate with a quasi-irreversible inhibitor of the carriers (carboxyatractylate and mersalyl, respectively, for adenine nucleotide and phosphate carriers), we determined the minimal quantity of inhibitor needed to completely block the carrier activity. We assumed that this quantity of inhibitor reflects the quantity of carrier. ATPase activity was measured at 37 °C in a medium containing 125 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm ATP, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Before measurement, mitochondria were incubated 2 min in 0.35% (w/v) Triton X-100 with or without 1.25 μg/mg protein oligomycin. Oligomycin-sensitive ATP hydrolysis was assessed by determination of Pi production (43Summer J.B. Science. 1944; 100: 413-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). As compared with control cells, thyroid status and PUFA deficiency significantly affected the respiratory rate of isolated liver cells; hyperthyroidy and PUFA deficiency increased JO2 by 75 and 28%, respectively, while hypothyroidy decreased it by 25% (Table I). Alcohol intoxication had no significant effect. Hyperthyroidy was responsible for a significant decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential. These results are in good agreement with data from isolated mitochondria where we found a large adaptive response among the five different conditions in both respiration (117–441 nanoatom of O/mg of proteins) and ATP synthesis (165–382 nmol of ATP/mg of proteins) (Fig.1 A). It is striking to note that the increase in maximal oxidative phosphorylation activity was accompanied by a simultaneous decrease in the coupling. Indeed, as can be see on Fig. 1 B, ATP/O ratio ranged from 1.6 to 0.9 nmol/nanoatom with succinate as substrate.Table IInfluence of physiological state on the cellular respiratory rateRespiratory rateΔΨmitonmol O 2 /min/mg dry weightmVControl12.9 ± 0.6−151 ± 2Hypothyroidy9.8 ± 0.6−151 ± 2*Hyperthyroidy22.7 ± 1.1−142 ± 1**Ethanol11.9 ± 0.9NDPUFA deficiency16.5 ± 0.5−152 ± 3*Rat liver cells (15 mg/ml) were incubated in a Krebs-bicarbonate medium containing 20 mm glucose as described under “Material and Methods.” After 25 min of incubation, myxothiazol-sensitive oxygen uptake (J O2) was determined.

However, if a change in the membrane permeability to protons were the only mechanism responsible for the observed change in the oxidative phosphorylation yield, the intrinsic efficiency of the respiratory chain would not be affected. As previously shown, this hypothesis can be tested by determining experimentally the relationship between the flux through the respiratory chain and the related overall thermodynamic driving force applied to it (4Rigoulet M. Leverve X. Fontaine E. Ouhabi R. Guérin B. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 184: 35-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Rigoulet M. Devin A. Espié P. Guérin B. Fontaine E. Piquet M.A. Nogueira V. Leverve X. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The overall thermodynamic driving force can be determined in our conditions simultaneously with the flux through the reaction (oxygen consumption rate, see “Material and Methods” and also Ref. 36Espié P. Guérin B. Rigoulet M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1230: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Therefore, a relationship between the respiratory rate and the overall thermodynamic driving force can be established in each of our different conditions by modulating the protonmotive force with small amounts of protonophore DNP. Since DNP is a pure protonophore, changes in respiratory rate induced by its addition are not related to any intrinsic effect at the level of the respiratory chain. Therefore, the relationship is characteristic of a given respiratory chain efficiency. As shown in Fig.2, it appears that different relationships were observed according to the different physiological conditions, indicating a change in respiratory chain efficiencyper se. It may be worth mentioning that the changes in the relationship between force and rate are consistent with the conclusion that the change does not simply result from an increase in the number of mitochondria per cell. The different components of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway were determined in our conditions in isolated mitochondria (TableII). In hypothyroidy total cytochrome, ANC, and Pi carrier contents were decreased approximately by 30% while ATPase activity was not significantly affected. Conversely, in hyperthyroidy, total cytochrome, ANC, Picarrier contents, and ATPase activity were significantly increased. In PUFA deficiency, total cytochrome content and ATPase activity were increased. ANC, Pi carrier contents, and ATPase activity were not determined in ethanol group, and total cytochrome content was not affected. The extreme observed changes are roughly comparable within the different enzymes involved in this pathway of oxidative phosphorylation: e.g. between 2- and 3-fold increase in hyperthyroidy as compared with hypothyroidy. However, there are some remarkable exceptions showing qualitative modifications of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. Actually, the main change occurred at the level of cytochrome oxidase, whose content ranged from 0.02 to 0.224 (nmol/mg protein), i.e. 11-fold, between hypothyroidy and hyperthyroidy. However, it should be pointed out that when compared with controls, the relative differences for the various proteins in hyperthyroidy are fairly limited to about 2-fold. As shown in Fig. 3, the changes in cytochromeaa 3 were closely related to changes in respiration both in state 4 and in state 3.Table IIInfluence of the physiological state on the content of oxidative phosphorylation pathway componentsCytochromes contentATPase activityAdenine nucleotide carrier contentPhosphate carrier contentaa 3bcc 1totalnmol/mg proteinnnmol P i /min/mg proteinpmol/mg proteinnmol/mg proteinControl0.097 ± 0.0110.188 ± 0.0150.210 ± 0.0170.495 ± 0.033413 ± 66177 ± 1510.50 ± 0.35Hypothyroidy0.020 ± 0.002*0.106 ± 0.008*0.215 ± 0.0280.341 ± 0.021*403 ± 15123 ± 23*7.45 ± 0.15*Hyperthyroidy0.224 ± 0.006*0.276 ± 0.018*0.320 ± 0.011*0.821 ± 0.024*796 ± 32*420 ± 9*12.80 ± 0.21*Ethanol0.044 ± 0.008*0.175 ± 0.0150.233 ± 0.0110.461 ± 0.011NDNDNDPUFA deficiency0.143 ± 0.013*0.235 ± 0.011*0.209 ± 0.0190.587 ± 0.032*719 ± 76*170 ± 1910.67 ± 0.41Liver mitochondria were isolated from control, hypothyroid, hyperthyroid, ethanol, and PUFA-deficient rats.

The proportion of cc 1 increased with the yield of oxidative phosphorylation (ATP/O) (Fig.4 B), while cytochrome aa 3 proportion decreased with ATP/O (Fig. 4 C). Since we found both quantitative (cellular JO2) and qualitative (mitochondrial cytochrome content expressed/mg of mitochondrial protein) modifications, the question arises of possible relationships between these parameters. As shown in Fig.5, we found tight relationships between oxygen consumption rate and total cytochrome contents both in intact liver cells and in isolated mitochondria. On one hand, cellular oxygen consumption rate was related to the cellular content of total cytochromes (Fig. 5 A), while on the other hand (Fig.5 B), the cellular oxygen consumption rate was also related to the qualitative changes of mitochondria (total cytochrome content/mg of mitochondrial protein). Furthermore, the increase in cellular oxygen consumption rate was significantly linked to a decrease in the yield of oxidative phosphorylation (ATP/O ratio, Fig. 5 C). In the different physiological conditions studied here, we found that liver cells can sustain very different rates of respiration and consequently of ATP turnover. Such a finding raises the question of the mechanism by which this energetic adaptation can occur. It should be noticed that these large variations were observed within a mitochondrion population of one given organ (liver) of one species (rat) and in conditions fully compatible with life. Such a physiological adaptation could be related to variations in the mitochondrial content of these liver cells. In the light of the data presented here, it is rather difficult to address precisely this issue since the yield of mitochondria and liver cell isolation cannot be directly compared due to a difference in isolation procedures. It must be noted, however, that the quantity of total cytochromes was dramatically affected in the different physiological conditions both when expressed per mg of dry cells or mg of protein of isolated mitochondria. Moreover, the strong relationships between the respiration observed in intact cells and the mitochondrial cytochrome content (see Fig. 5, A and B) favor the view that the main modification permitting this adaptation is the change in the oxidative phosphorylation complexes expressed by mg of mitochondrial protein. In addition, since the intercept of these relationships are close to zero, this suggests that whatever the condition, the cellular respiratory activity per “unit of respiratory chain” is constant. It must be noted that the cellular oxygen consumption considered here is purely related to mitochondrial respiration since it is myxothiazol-sensitive. Besides this adaptive change in the amount of oxidative phosphorylation complexes, we also found a change in the efficiency of the respiratory chain when assessed in intact cells (see Fig. 2). It appears that when the cellular respiratory rate increases, the efficiency of the respiratory chain decreases. The data obtained in isolated mitochondria show that the increase in cytochrome content is associated to a redistribution in the respective proportion of the different cytochromes. Among these changes, the modification on cytochrome oxidase content appears to be prominent since it is increased more than 10-fold from hypothyroidy to hyperthyroidy. In addition, these changes are significantly related to ATP/O (see Fig. 4). It is well known that cytochrome oxidase is a location of a slippage between the redox reaction and the vectorial proton transport across the inner mitochondrial membrane (2Fitton V. Rigoulet M.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 2098-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). As a general effect, there was a very significant relationship between the respiratory rate in intact cells and the yield of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation as assessed by ATP/O ratio (Fig. 5 C). Recently, in liver mitochondria isolated from rat chronically intoxicated by ethanol, we have provided evidence that the significant decrease in cytochrome oxidase content was associated to an increase in the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation (19Piquet M.A. Nogueira V. Devin A. Sibille B. Filippi C. Fontaine E. Roulet M. Rigoulet M. Leverve X.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This finding was further confirmed by data showing an increase in oxidative phosphorylation efficiency resulting from an acute inhibition of cytochrome oxidase by sodium azide, an inhibitor of cytochrome oxidase, adequately added to mimic the effects of ethanol intoxication in control mitochondria. This finding led us to propose the existence of a causal relationship between cytochrome oxidase content and the yield of oxidative phosphorylation. Thus, the increase in the proportion of cytochrome oxidase reported in the present work is probably responsible for the decrease in the overall efficiency in the respiratory chain observed in intact cells. Hyperthyroidy was responsible for a decrease in the ΔΨmito as assessed in intact cells, which is in favor of a primary increase in slippage responsible for a decreased membrane potential. Several reports in the literature have investigated the relationship between mitochondrial membrane potential and hyperthyroidy, and the results are conflicting, probably depending on the experimental tool used for assessing membrane potential in intact cells (5Bobyleva V.

J. 1992; 281: 171-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This could also explain the decrease in the overall coupling in oxidative phosphorylation (ATP/O ratio) when oxidative phosphorylation flux increases (Figs. 1 and 5). Taken together, these data support the view that in the different physiological or pathological conditions studied here, the number of “respiratory chain units” is linked to the need for ATP synthesis, as evidenced by the strict relation between cellular respiration and total mitochondrial cytochrome content expressed per mg of dry cells or mitochondrial protein. These quantitative adaptations in terms of total cytochromes are accompanied by qualitative changes since the proportion of cytochrome oxidase increases with the total amount of cytochrome, this latter effect being most probably responsible for a change in the efficiency. Hence, as evidenced in Fig. 5 C, the adaptive increase in cellular respiration in our experimental conditions is accompanied by a decrease in the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation, and vice versa. Thus, conversely to acute changes in ATP synthesis, which are due to changes in oxidative phosphorylation rate at constant cytochrome content, the adaptive modification in the number of respiratory chain units in chronic situations allows an increase of the total ATP synthesis rate. This is achieved at a constant rate per unit of cytochrome content but at the expense of an increase in energy wastage, due to a slippage at the level of cytochrome oxidase."

We showed that the novel Dbl family proto-oncoprotein Brx enhances ligand-dependent activity of ERα via a Cdc42-dependent pathway. Brx also significantly enhances ligand-dependent activity of ERβ. This enhancement is not affected by inhibition of p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation by PD98059.

The effects of estrogen in these tissues are due to changes in gene expression modulated by the estrogen receptors (ERs)1 that are members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily of transcription factors. After being activated by binding estrogen, the ER activates transcription of hormone-responsive genes. Prior to 1996 estrogen-dependent effects were thought to be mediated by a single estrogen receptor molecule, now designated ERα. Another estrogen receptor, ERβ, was cloned from human testis (1Kuiper G.G.J.M. Enmark E. Pelto-Huikko M. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 93: 5925-5930Google Scholar, 2Mosselman S. Polman J. Dijkema R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (2038) Google Scholar). The ERs are modular transcription factors containing two transcription activation functions, AF-1 located in the N-terminal A/B domain, and AF-2 located within the C-terminal ligand-binding domain. Although AF-2 function is dependent upon ligand binding, AF-1 functions independently of ligand binding (reviewed in Ref. 3Tsai M. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar) but synergizes with AF-2 in the promotion of ligand-dependent transcription activation by the receptor (4Tora L. White J. Brou C. Tasset D. Webster N. Scheer E. Chambon P. Cell. 1989; 59: 477-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar).The ER can also be activated by ligand-independent pathways involving signals originating from growth factor receptors. This pathway involves signaling from cell surface receptors and results in phosphorylation of the estrogen receptor (reviewed in Refs. 5O'Malley B.W. Schrader W.T. Mani S. Smith C. Weigel N.L.

Genes to Cells. 2000; 5: 593-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Activation of ERα by epidermal growth factor was shown to involve phosphorylation of serine 118 in the AF-1 region of ERα through a Ras-Raf-MAPK signaling pathway (7Kato S. Endoh H. Mashuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Sasaki H. Masushige S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Kawashima H. Metzger D. Chambon P. Science. 1995; 270: 1491-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar, 8Bunone G. Briand P.A. Miksicek R.J. Picard D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2174-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Both ERα and ERβ are activated in transient transfection systems by co-expression of the oncogenic V12 mutant of Ras (RasV12). In both cases the activation depends on phosphorylation of target serine residues located within the receptors' AF-1 domains by p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2) (9Tremblay G.B. Tremblay A. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Labrie F. Giguere V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Ras-dependent phosphorylation of the AF-1 domain of ERβ is thought to enhance ligand-independent transcriptional activation by enhancing recruitment of transcription co-activators such as SRC-1 (10Tremblay A. Tremblay G. Labrie F. Giguere V. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 513-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar).We previously described the cloning and characterization of a cDNA encoding a protein Brx (breast cancer nuclear hormonereceptor auxiliary factor) that interacts with ERα, is preferentially expressed in reproductive and immune tissues, and augments ligand-dependent transcriptional activation by ERα (11Rubino D. Driggers P. Arbit D. Kemp L. Miller B. Coso O. Pagliai K. Gray K. Gutkind J. Segars J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2513-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis showed that Brx belongs to the Dbl family of proto-oncogenes (reviewed in Ref. 12Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) that function as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for Rho-GTPases, small Ras-related cytoplasmic proteins involved in signal transduction pathways governing growth and morphogenic transformation. Proteins acting as GEFs shift the equilibria of small GTPases toward an active GTP-bound state. We found that activation of ERα by Brx in transient transfection assays involves the Rho-related GTPase Cdc42. Our findings demonstrated for the first time that ERα function might be modulated by pathways dependent on small GTPases other than Ras.Brx mRNA is highly expressed in the same human tissues that express ERβ mRNA. These include, specifically, ovary, uterus, testis, spleen, thymus, peripheral blood leukocytes, and specific areas of the brain, including the amygdala and hypothalamus, 2D. M. Rubino, unpublished. 2D. M. Rubino, unpublished. which are thought to be regulated by estrogen. The present study was performed to investigate the effect of Brx on ERβ. We show that Brx enhances ligand-dependent activity of ERβ. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Brx sends signals to ERβ through a pathway involving p38 MAPKs.DISCUSSIONThe estrogen receptors (ERs) are modular ligand-inducible transcription factors that play a key role in the regulation of growth and differentiation of reproductive tissues. An important issue in the study of ER signal transduction pathways is that of ligand-independent activation (5O'Malley B.W. Schrader W.T. Mani S. Smith C. Weigel N.L. Conneely O.M. Clark J.H. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1995; 50: 333-347PubMed Google Scholar). Studies have documented effects upon ER-mediated gene activation by epidermal growth factor and other growth factors acting as ligand-independent receptor activators. Both ERα and ERβ can be activated independently of ligand binding by a Ras-Raf-p44/42 MAPK signaling pathway involving the phosphorylation of specific Ser residues in the receptors' AF-1 domains (9Tremblay G.B. Tremblay A. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Labrie F. Giguere V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). In the case of ERβ, modification of the receptor was proposed to affect transcription by enhancing the recruitment of steroid receptor co-activator-1 (SRC-1) (10Tremblay A. Tremblay G. Labrie F. Giguere V. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 513-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The demonstration of signaling pathways linking Ras to regulation of ER activity was an important observation, because Ras has a critical role in cellular proliferation and oncogenesis.Members of the Ras-related Rho family of small GTPases, including Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, regulate a variety of crucial cellular processes, including cytoskeletal organization, gene expression, cell cycle progression, cell adhesion, and intracellular membrane trafficking (30Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar,31Kjoller L. Hall A. Exp. Cell. Res. 1999; 253: 166-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). These proteins are regulated by GTP binding and are activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (Rho-GEFs) that catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP. Rho-GEFs constitute a group of oncoproteins containing Dbl homology and pleckstrin homology domains that are required for the nucleotide exchange function (12Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Different Rho-GEFs possess a variety of structural motifs presumably regulating function and specific interactions with other proteins. Although the Rho-GEFs are thought to be important targets of upstream activators of Rho GTPases, relatively little is known about the regulation of function of most of the GEFs. We recently described the cloning ofbrx, a novel Dbl family proto-oncogene, encoding Brx, a protein that enhances ligand-dependent activity of ERα by a Cdc42-dependent pathway (11Rubino D. Driggers P. Arbit D. Kemp L. Miller B. Coso O. Pagliai K. Gray K. Gutkind J. Segars J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2513-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Our report was the first to implicate Rho GTPases in the regulation of ER function. Recently, Su et al. (32Su L.F. Knoblauch R. Garabedian M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3231-3237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) demonstrated enhancement of ERα activity by the guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor GDIα, a finding that provided further support for a role for Rho GTPases in the regulation of ER activity. In this report we demonstrate that Brx enhances ligand-dependent activity of ERβ. The mechanism appears not to involve the p44/42 MAPK pathway, but instead involves activation of a p38 MAPK pathway (Fig. 5). This report represents the first report implicating p38 MAPK activation in the regulation of ERβ function.Brx mRNA is highly expressed in human tissues that express ERβ mRNA, specifically including ovary, uterus, testis, spleen, thymus, peripheral blood leukocytes, and specific areas of the brain, including the amygdala and hypothalamus, which are thought to be regulated by estrogen (11Rubino D. Driggers P. Arbit D. Kemp L. Miller B. Coso O. Pagliai K. Gray K. Gutkind J. Segars J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2513-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).2 Immunohistochemical staining of human ovarian tissues showed high levels of Brx protein expression in granulosa cells of follicles (33Miller B. Rubino D. Driggers P. Haddad B. Cisar M. Gray K. Segars J. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 2000; 182: 286-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These data suggest that Brx is co-expressed in tissues expressing ERβ. We also found that Brx interacts with ERβ in binding assays in vitro.2 Given these findings, we wanted to know whether Brx affects ERβ function. In transient transfection assays using Ishikawa human endometrial adenocarcinoma cells, ligand-dependent activity of ERβ was markedly enhanced by co-transfection of a Brx expression vector. The full level of reporter activity required Brx, ERβ, the ERE, and estrogen. Addition of tamoxifen totally eliminated ligand-dependent activity of ERβ. In control experiments we demonstrated that activation of Brx is selective, because Brx did not affect the activity of the chimeric transcription factor GAL4-VP16. Additionally, analysis of protein expression levels in transfected COS-7 cells showed that Brx did not affect the level of GAL4-ERβ protein expression, a finding that suggests Brx does not augment ligand-dependent receptor activity simply by increasing receptor expression. Taken together, these results suggest that Brx affects the ligand-dependent activity of ERβ itself.We examined the possibility that Brx enhances ERβ activity through a Ras-p44/42 MAPK pathway. Inhibition of MAPK activation by PD98059 did not affect the observed enhancement of ligand-dependent ERβ activity by Brx, suggesting that Brx affects ERβ function by a pathway that does not depend on activation of MAPK. We have also found that enhancement of ERα activity by Brx involves neither p44/42 MAPK nor phosphorylation of Ser-118.2 These findings showed that Brx must affect ERβ by signaling pathways distinct from the previously described Ras and p44/42 MAPK-dependent pathways (9Tremblay G.B. Tremblay A. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Labrie F. Giguere V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar).We previously demonstrated that Brx augments ligand-dependent activity of ERα by a Cdc42-dependent pathway (11Rubino D. Driggers P. Arbit D. Kemp L. Miller B. Coso O. Pagliai K. Gray K. Gutkind J. Segars J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2513-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Mutationally activated Cdc42 also strongly activates JNK and p38 MAPK (14Coso O. Chiariello M., Yu, J. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar, 22Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.-X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). One possibility, therefore, is that Brx activates a JNK or p38 MAPK that in turn augments ligand-dependent function of ERβ either directly or indirectly. We therefore tested for an effect of the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190 on ERβ activation by Brx and found that 2 μm SB202190 inhibited enhancement of ERβ activity by Brx by ∼70%, suggesting that p38 MAPK activity is required for activation of ERβ by Brx. We next tested directly whether a specific p38 MAPK could activate ERβ. Although transient transfection of either p38β2 or MKK6-EE was insufficient to activate the receptor, transfection of both synergistically activated the receptor. Similarly, for the GAL4-Elk-1 transfection control experiments, we found that the combination of both p38β2 and MKK6-EE cooperatively activated the luciferase reporter. We do not know why transfection of MKK6-EE was insufficient to activate ERβ. It is possible that MKK6-EE was unable to activate cellular p38 MAPK in Ishikawa cells, although it was able to do so in COS-7 cells in our control experiment. Unfortunately, our transfection efficiency for the Ishikawa cells has been too low to permit a similar analysis. Selectivity of p38 MAPK isoform activation by MKK6 has been described by Alonso (34Alonso G. Ambrosino C. Jones M. Nebreda A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40641-40648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This group showed that, at relatively low concentrations both in vitro and in vivo, wild-type MKK6 activated p38α but failed to activate p38γ. At present, we do not know which p38 MAPK isoforms are expressed in Ishikawa cells and we have not yet determined whether the enhancement of ERβ activity by Brx exhibits selectivity for p38 MAPK isoforms. It is also possible that MKK6 is not involved in activation of ERβ by Brx in the Ishikawa cells. Our findings do suggest, however, that endogenous p38 MAPK activity in Ishikawa is required for activation of ERβ by Brx and that activation of p38β2 MAPK by MKK6-EE effectively enhances ligand-dependent activity of the receptor. We showed that Brx expression results in the activation of endogenous p38 MAPK in COS-7 cells.p38 MAPKs have well established roles in the regulation and function of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1; they are also activated in cultured cells in response to environmental stresses such as exposure to UV radiation and hyperosmotic conditions (reviewed in Ref. 35Paul A. Wilson S. Belham C.M. Robinson C.J.M. Scott P.H. Gould G.W. Plevin R. Cell. Signal. 1997; 9: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Recent experiments suggest that activation of p38 MAPK pathways may also play important roles in cellular differentiation processes. Differentiation in vitro of several cell lines has been shown to depend on p38 MAPK activity (reviewed in Ref. 36Nebreda A. Porras A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 257-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). It was recently reported that activation of p38 MAPKs is deficient in rhabdomyosarcoma cells (37Puri P.L. Wu Z. Zhang P. Wood L.D. Bhakta K.S. Han J. Feramisco J.R. Karin M. Wang J.Y.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 574-584PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of p38 MAPKs in these cells by ectopic expression of MKK6-EE resulted in growth arrest and terminal differentiation. Our findings suggest that p38 MAPKs may also play a role in the regulation of estrogen receptors, which are in turn key regulators of growth and differentiation in reproductive tissues.During the preparation of this manuscript, Lee et al. (38Lee H. Jiang F. Wang Q. Nicosia S.V. Yang J. Su B. Bai W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1882-1896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) published a report showing activation of ERα by constitutively active MEKK1 in Ishikawa cells. These authors proposed that MEKK1 activates ERα through activation of JNK and p38 MAPK. They also demonstrated phosphorylation of ERα by p38 MAPK in vitro. These findings, considered together with our own results, suggest that p38 MAPKs may be important regulators of both forms of ER.We do not know the mechanism for enhancement of ERβ activity by p38 MAPK and whether direct phosphorylation of the receptor by p38 MAPK is involved. However, we observed that p38 MAPK efficiently phosphorylated ERβ in vitro. By analogy with p44/42 MAPK-dependent activation of ERβ, direct phosphorylation of the receptor could affect the ability of liganded receptor to interact with or recruit a transcriptional co-activator such as SRC-1. Alternatively, p38 MAPK may indirectly affect the activity of ERβ by phosphorylating other factors required for ERβ function such as SRC-1 or p300. The steroid hormone estrogen plays a critical role in the regulation of growth and development of reproductive tissues. The effects of estrogen in these tissues are due to changes in gene expression modulated by the estrogen receptors (ERs)1 that are members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily of transcription factors. After being activated by binding estrogen, the ER activates transcription of hormone-responsive genes. Prior to 1996 estrogen-dependent effects were thought to be mediated by a single estrogen receptor molecule, now designated ERα. Another estrogen receptor, ERβ, was cloned from human testis (1Kuiper G.G.J.M. Enmark E. Pelto-Huikko M. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 93: 5925-5930Google Scholar, 2Mosselman S. Polman J. Dijkema R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (2038) Google Scholar). The ERs are modular transcription factors containing two transcription activation functions, AF-1 located in the N-terminal A/B domain, and AF-2 located within the C-terminal ligand-binding domain. Although AF-2 function is dependent upon ligand binding, AF-1 functions independently of ligand binding (reviewed in Ref. 3Tsai M. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar) but synergizes with AF-2 in the promotion of ligand-dependent transcription activation by the receptor (4Tora L. White J. Brou C. Tasset D. Webster N. Scheer E. Chambon P. Cell. 1989; 59: 477-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). The ER can also be activated by ligand-independent pathways involving signals originating from growth factor receptors. This pathway involves signaling from cell surface receptors and results in phosphorylation of the estrogen receptor (reviewed in Refs. 5O'Malley B.W. Schrader W.T. Mani S. Smith C. Weigel N.L. Conneely O.M. Clark J.H. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1995; 50: 333-347PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kato S. Masuhiro Y. Watanabe M. Kobayashi Y. Takeyama K. Endoh H. Yanagisawa J. Genes to Cells. 2000; 5: 593-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Activation of ERα by epidermal growth factor was shown to involve phosphorylation of serine 118 in the AF-1 region of ERα through a Ras-Raf-MAPK signaling pathway (7Kato S. Endoh H. Mashuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Sasaki H. Masushige S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Kawashima H. Metzger D. Chambon P. Science. 1995; 270: 1491-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar, 8Bunone G. Briand P.A. Miksicek R.J. Picard D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2174-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Both ERα and ERβ are activated in transient transfection systems by co-expression of the oncogenic V12 mutant of Ras (RasV12). In both cases the activation depends on phosphorylation of target serine residues located within the receptors' AF-1 domains by p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2) (9Tremblay G.B. Tremblay A. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Labrie F. Giguere V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Ras-dependent phosphorylation of the AF-1 domain of ERβ is thought to enhance ligand-independent transcriptional activation by enhancing recruitment of transcription co-activators such as SRC-1 (10Tremblay A. Tremblay G. Labrie F. Giguere V. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 513-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). We previously described the cloning and characterization of a cDNA encoding a protein Brx (breast cancer nuclear hormonereceptor auxiliary factor) that interacts with ERα, is preferentially expressed in reproductive and immune tissues, and augments ligand-dependent transcriptional activation by ERα (11Rubino D. Driggers P. Arbit D. Kemp L. Miller B. Coso O. Pagliai K. Gray K. Gutkind J. Segars J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2513-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis showed that Brx belongs to the Dbl family of proto-oncogenes (reviewed in Ref. 12Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) that function as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for Rho-GTPases, small Ras-related cytoplasmic proteins involved in signal transduction pathways governing growth and morphogenic transformation. Proteins acting as GEFs shift the equilibria of small GTPases toward an active GTP-bound state. We found that activation of ERα by Brx in transient transfection assays involves the Rho-related GTPase Cdc42. Our findings demonstrated for the first time that ERα function might be modulated by pathways dependent on small GTPases other than Ras. Brx mRNA is highly expressed in the same human tissues that express ERβ mRNA. These include, specifically, ovary, uterus, testis, spleen, thymus, peripheral blood leukocytes, and specific areas of the brain, including the amygdala and hypothalamus, 2D. M. Rubino, unpublished. 2D. M. Rubino, unpublished. which are thought to be regulated by estrogen. The present study was performed to investigate the effect of Brx on ERβ. We show that Brx enhances ligand-dependent activity of ERβ. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Brx sends signals to ERβ through a pathway involving p38 MAPKs. DISCUSSIONThe estrogen receptors (ERs) are modular ligand-inducible transcription factors that play a key role in the regulation of growth and differentiation of reproductive tissues. An important issue in the study of ER signal transduction pathways is that of ligand-independent activation (5O'Malley B.W. Schrader W.T. Mani S. Smith C. Weigel N.L. Conneely O.M. Clark J.H. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1995; 50: 333-347PubMed Google Scholar). Studies have documented effects upon ER-mediated gene activation by epidermal growth factor and other growth factors acting as ligand-independent receptor activators. Both ERα and ERβ can be activated independently of ligand binding by a Ras-Raf-p44/42 MAPK signaling pathway involving the phosphorylation of specific Ser residues in the receptors' AF-1 domains (9Tremblay G.B. Tremblay A. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Labrie F. Giguere V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). In the case of ERβ, modification of the receptor was proposed to affect transcription by enhancing the recruitment of steroid receptor co-activator-1 (SRC-1) (10Tremblay A. Tremblay G. Labrie F. Giguere V. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 513-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The demonstration of signaling pathways linking Ras to regulation of ER activity was an important observation, because Ras has a critical role in cellular proliferation and oncogenesis.Members of the Ras-related Rho family of small GTPases, including Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, regulate a variety of crucial cellular processes, including cytoskeletal organization, gene expression, cell cycle progression, cell adhesion, and intracellular membrane trafficking (30Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar,31Kjoller L. Hall A. Exp. Cell. Res. 1999; 253: 166-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). These proteins are regulated by GTP binding and are activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (Rho-GEFs) that catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP. Rho-GEFs constitute a group of oncoproteins containing Dbl homology and pleckstrin homology domains that are required for the nucleotide exchange function (12Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Different Rho-GEFs possess a variety of structural motifs presumably regulating function and specific interactions with other proteins. Although the Rho-GEFs are thought to be important targets of upstream activators of Rho GTPases, relatively little is known about the regulation of function of most of the GEFs. We recently described the cloning ofbrx, a novel Dbl family proto-oncogene, encoding Brx, a protein that enhances ligand-dependent activity of ERα by a Cdc42-dependent pathway (11Rubino D. Driggers P. Arbit D. Kemp L. Miller B. Coso O. Pagliai K. Gray K. Gutkind J. Segars J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2513-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Our report was the first to implicate Rho GTPases in the regulation of ER function. Recently, Su et al. (32Su L.F. Knoblauch R. Garabedian M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3231-3237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) demonstrated enhancement of ERα activity by the guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor GDIα, a finding that provided further support for a role for Rho GTPases in the regulation of ER activity. In this report we demonstrate that Brx enhances ligand-dependent activity of ERβ. The mechanism appears not to involve the p44/42 MAPK pathway, but instead involves activation of a p38 MAPK pathway (Fig. 5). This report represents the first report implicating p38 MAPK activation in the regulation of ERβ function.Brx mRNA is highly expressed in human tissues that express ERβ mRNA, specifically including ovary, uterus, testis, spleen, thymus, peripheral blood leukocytes, and specific areas of the brain, including the amygdala and hypothalamus, which are thought to be regulated by estrogen (11Rubino D. Driggers P. Arbit D. Kemp L. Miller B. Coso O. Pagliai K. Gray K. Gutkind J. Segars J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2513-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).2 Immunohistochemical staining of human ovarian tissues showed high levels of Brx protein expression in granulosa cells of follicles (33Miller B. Rubino D. Driggers P. Haddad B. Cisar M. Gray K. Segars J. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 2000; 182: 286-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These data suggest that Brx is co-expressed in tissues expressing ERβ. We also found that Brx interacts with ERβ in binding assays in vitro.2 Given these findings, we wanted to know whether Brx affects ERβ function. In transient transfection assays using Ishikawa human endometrial adenocarcinoma cells, ligand-dependent activity of ERβ was markedly enhanced by co-transfection of a Brx expression vector. The full level of reporter activity required Brx, ERβ, the ERE, and estrogen. Addition of tamoxifen totally eliminated ligand-dependent activity of ERβ. In control experiments we demonstrated that activation of Brx is selective, because Brx did not affect the activity of the chimeric transcription factor GAL4-VP16. Additionally, analysis of protein expression levels in transfected COS-7 cells showed that Brx did not affect the level of GAL4-ERβ protein expression, a finding that suggests Brx does not augment ligand-dependent receptor activity simply by increasing receptor expression. Taken together, these results suggest that Brx affects the ligand-dependent activity of ERβ itself.We examined the possibility that Brx enhances ERβ activity through a Ras-p44/42 MAPK pathway. Inhibition of MAPK activation by PD98059 did not affect the observed enhancement of ligand-dependent ERβ activity by Brx, suggesting that Brx affects ERβ function by a pathway that does not depend on activation of MAPK. We have also found that enhancement of ERα activity by Brx involves neither p44/42 MAPK nor phosphorylation of Ser-118.2 These findings showed that Brx must affect ERβ by signaling pathways distinct from the previously described Ras and p44/42 MAPK-dependent pathways (9Tremblay G.B. Tremblay A. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Labrie F. Giguere V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar).We previously demonstrated that Brx augments ligand-dependent activity of ERα by a Cdc42-dependent pathway (11Rubino D. Driggers P. Arbit D. Kemp L. Miller B. Coso O. Pagliai K. Gray K. Gutkind J. Segars J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2513-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Mutationally activated Cdc42 also strongly activates JNK and p38 MAPK (14Coso O. Chiariello M., Yu, J. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar, 22Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.-X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). One possibility, therefore, is that Brx activates a JNK or p38 MAPK that in turn augments ligand-dependent function of ERβ either directly or indirectly. We therefore tested for an effect of the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190 on ERβ activation by Brx and found that 2 μm SB202190 inhibited enhancement of ERβ activity by Brx by ∼70%, suggesting that p38 MAPK activity is required for activation of ERβ by Brx. We next tested directly whether a specific p38 MAPK could activate ERβ. Although transient transfection of either p38β2 or MKK6-EE was insufficient to activate the receptor, transfection of both synergistically activated the receptor. Similarly, for the GAL4-Elk-1 transfection control experiments, we found that the combination of both p38β2 and MKK6-EE cooperatively activated the luciferase reporter. We do not know why transfection of MKK6-EE was insufficient to activate ERβ. It is possible that MKK6-EE was unable to activate cellular p38 MAPK in Ishikawa cells, although it was able to do so in COS-7 cells in our control experiment. Unfortunately, our transfection efficiency for the Ishikawa cells has been too low to permit a similar analysis. Selectivity of p38 MAPK isoform activation by MKK6 has been described by Alonso (34Alonso G. Ambrosino C. Jones M. Nebreda A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40641-40648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This group showed that, at relatively low concentrations both in vitro and in vivo, wild-type MKK6 activated p38α but failed to activate p38γ. At present, we do not know which p38 MAPK isoforms are expressed in Ishikawa cells and we have not yet determined whether the enhancement of ERβ activity by Brx exhibits selectivity for p38 MAPK isoforms. It is also possible that MKK6 is not involved in activation of ERβ by Brx in the Ishikawa cells. Our findings do suggest, however, that endogenous p38 MAPK activity in Ishikawa is required for activation of ERβ by Brx and that activation of p38β2 MAPK by MKK6-EE effectively enhances ligand-dependent activity of the receptor. We showed that Brx expression results in the activation of endogenous p38 MAPK in COS-7 cells.p38 MAPKs have well established roles in the regulation and function of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1; they are also activated in cultured cells in response to environmental stresses such as exposure to UV radiation and hyperosmotic conditions (reviewed in Ref. 35Paul A. Wilson S. Belham C.M. Robinson C.J.M. Scott P.H. Gould G.W. Plevin R. Cell. Signal. 1997; 9: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Recent experiments suggest that activation of p38 MAPK pathways may also play important roles in cellular differentiation processes. Differentiation in vitro of several cell lines has been shown to depend on p38 MAPK activity (reviewed in Ref. 36Nebreda A. Porras A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 257-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). It was recently reported that activation of p38 MAPKs is deficient in rhabdomyosarcoma cells (37Puri P.L. Wu Z. Zhang P. Wood L.D. Bhakta K.S. Han J. Feramisco J.R. Karin M. Wang J.Y.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 574-584PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of p38 MAPKs in these cells by ectopic expression of MKK6-EE resulted in growth arrest and terminal differentiation. Our findings suggest that p38 MAPKs may also play a role in the regulation of estrogen receptors, which are in turn key regulators of growth and differentiation in reproductive tissues.During the preparation of this manuscript, Lee et al. (38Lee H. Jiang F. Wang Q. Nicosia S.V. Yang J. Su B. Bai W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1882-1896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) published a report showing activation of ERα by constitutively active MEKK1 in Ishikawa cells. These authors proposed that MEKK1 activates ERα through activation of JNK and p38 MAPK. They also demonstrated phosphorylation of ERα by p38 MAPK in vitro. These findings, considered together with our own results, suggest that p38 MAPKs may be important regulators of both forms of ER.We do not know the mechanism for enhancement of ERβ activity by p38 MAPK and whether direct phosphorylation of the receptor by p38 MAPK is involved. However, we observed that p38 MAPK efficiently phosphorylated ERβ in vitro. By analogy with p44/42 MAPK-dependent activation of ERβ, direct phosphorylation of the receptor could affect the ability of liganded receptor to interact with or recruit a transcriptional co-activator such as SRC-1. Alternatively, p38 MAPK may indirectly affect the activity of ERβ by phosphorylating other factors required for ERβ function such as SRC-1 or p300. The estrogen receptors (ERs) are modular ligand-inducible transcription factors that play a key role in the regulation of growth and differentiation of reproductive tissues. An important issue in the study of ER signal transduction pathways is that of ligand-independent activation (5O'Malley B.W. Schrader W.T. Mani S. Smith C. Weigel N.L. Conneely O.M. Clark J.H.

Studies have documented effects upon ER-mediated gene activation by epidermal growth factor and other growth factors acting as ligand-independent receptor activators. Both ERα and ERβ can be activated independently of ligand binding by a Ras-Raf-p44/42 MAPK signaling pathway involving the phosphorylation of specific Ser residues in the receptors' AF-1 domains (9Tremblay G.B.

https://openalex.org/W1486415662,"Interleukin-5 (IL-5) is a T-cell cytokine involved in Type 2 diseases and is commonly described as being coordinately regulated with other Type 2 cytokines, such as IL-4 and IL-13. Considering the unique control of eosinophilia by IL-5, such coordinate regulation would be surprising. In fact, the biological specificity of eosinophilia and its control by IL-5 suggests a unique and independent control of IL-5 regulation. In this report we show the binding of GATA-3 to three sites in the human IL-5 promoter in the human T-cell line PER117. The previously identified −70 site and another site at position −152 are shown to positively regulate IL-5 transcription. More importantly, the site located at −400 acts as a powerful repressor of IL-5 transcription with mutagenesis of this site allowing a high level expression of IL-5 without the activation of other factors normally required for IL-5 expression. Whereas GATA-3 has been proposed to be involved in the regulation of the IL-4/IL-5/IL-13 locus, we show here that it has another function in controlling IL-5 transcription that supports the observed unique biological function of this cytokine. Interleukin-5 (IL-5) is a T-cell cytokine involved in Type 2 diseases and is commonly described as being coordinately regulated with other Type 2 cytokines, such as IL-4 and IL-13. Considering the unique control of eosinophilia by IL-5, such coordinate regulation would be surprising. In fact, the biological specificity of eosinophilia and its control by IL-5 suggests a unique and independent control of IL-5 regulation. In this report we show the binding of GATA-3 to three sites in the human IL-5 promoter in the human T-cell line PER117. The previously identified −70 site and another site at position −152 are shown to positively regulate IL-5 transcription.

It is observed in a restricted pattern of disease, classically helminth infections and allergy. These fluctuations in eosinophil numbers can occur with little if any change in other leukocytes and are often but not always associated with increased levels of IgE antibody (reviewed in Refs. 1Sanderson C.J. Blood. 1992; 79: 3101-3109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 2Schwenger G.T. Mordvinov V.A. Fournier R. Czabotar P. Peroni S. Sanderson C.J. Academic Press, 2000Google Scholar). Taken together, the restricted and independent production of eosinophils suggests a restricted and independent control of IL-5 production. However, IL-5 is commonly described as being coordinately expressed with other members of the locus (IL-4 and IL-13), especially IL-4. Such coordinate regulation is not consistent with the biology of eosinophilia. To objectively investigate the regulation of IL-5 expression, this assumption needs to be challenged. Two reports describe IL-5 and IL-4 as being predominantly produced by different human peripheral T-cells, indicating independent regulation of IL-4 and IL-5 (3Jung T. Schauer U. Rieger C. Wagner K. Einsle K. Neumann C. Heusser C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 2413-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 4Krug N. Jung T. Napp U. Wagner K. Schultze-Werninghaus G. Heusser C. Rieger C.H. Schauer U. Fabel H. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1998; 158: 754-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In fact, the paper by Jung and colleagues (3Jung T. Schauer U. Rieger C. Wagner K. Einsle K. Neumann C. Heusser C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 2413-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) describe IL-4 and IL-5 as being “rarely co-expressed by human T-cells” and goes on to report that it is cloned T-cells that display the anomaly of co-expression of these cytokines. Thus, even in situations where both IL-4 and IL-5 are co-expressed in an individual in a Type 2 disease, it appears that they are expressed in different T-cell populations. How is this general tendency to express Type 2 cytokines in these diseases regulated at the gene level when they are apparently not coordinately expressed at the cell level? GATA-3 is predominantly expressed by T-cells (5Ho I.C. Vorhees P. Marin N. Oakley B.K. Tsai S.F. Orkin S.H. Leiden J.M.

T-cell-specific expression of a dominant-negative mutant in mice decreased Type 2 cytokine expression, thus reducing eosinophil and IgE production (12Zhang D.H. Yang L. Cohn L. Parkyn L. Homer R. Ray P. Ray A. Immunity. 1999; 11: 473-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Conversely, the expression of GATA-3 in T-cells in transgenic mice induced Type 2 commitment with increased capacity for Type 2 cytokine production (13Nawijn M.C. Dingjan G.M. Ferreira R. Lambrecht B.N. Karis A. Grosveld F. Savelkoul H. Hendriks R.W. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 724-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These experiments are consistent with a role for GATA-3 in the regulation of the IL-4/IL-5/IL-13 locus (14Takemoto N. Kamogawa Y. Jun Lee H. Kurata H. Arai K.I. O'Garra A. Arai N. Miyatake S. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6687-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), but they do not provide an explanation for the unique characteristics of IL-5 expression. The promoters of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 have little in common and may provide the basis for independent expression. Whereas GATA has not been shown to have a direct effect on the transcription of the IL-4 promoter (12Zhang D.H. Yang L. Cohn L. Parkyn L. Homer R. Ray P. Ray A. Immunity. 1999; 11: 473-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 15Lee H.J. O' Garra A. Arai K. Arai N. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2343-2352PubMed Google Scholar), it does interact with a site (−70) in the IL-5 promoter. This is necessary but not sufficient for IL-5 expression (16Blumenthal S.G. Aichele G.

Biol. 1995; 15: 3830-3839Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and may be an important factor in the differential expression of IL-4 and IL-5. Another important difference lies in the conserved lymphokine element 0 (CLE0), which shows low conservation between these two cytokine genes (18Masuda E.S. Tokumitsu H. Tsuboi A. Shlomai J. Hung P. Arai K. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7399-7407Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In the IL-5 promoter (−42 to −56), it plays a major role as the on/off switch for IL-5 transcription. It binds activator protein 1 (AP-1) members JunD and Fos-related antigen 2 as well as Oct-1 and Oct-2 factors and is critical for IL-5 expression (19Thomas M.A. Mordvinov V.A. Sanderson C.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 300-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 20Mori A. Kaminuma O. Mikami T. Hoshino A. Ohmura T. Miyazawa K. Suko M. Okudaira H. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 1997; 113: 272-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Additional activation signals for IL-5 come from the nuclear factor of activated T-cells site at position −110 (21Prieschl E.E. Gouilleux-Gruart V. Walker C. Harrer N.E. Baumruker T. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6112-6119PubMed Google Scholar, 22De Boer M.L. Mordvinov V.A. Thomas M. Sanderson C.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1221-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We have recently also identified two repressor elements, hPRE1-IL5 and hPRE2-IL5 in the proximal and distal IL-5 promoters, respectively. Because of the apparent importance of GATA-3 in the regulation of the locus, we have undertaken a detailed analysis of its role in transcription. Similar to the reports for IL-4 (23Ranganath S. Ouyang W. Bhattarcharya D. Sha W.C. Grupe A. Peltz G. Murphy K.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3822-3826PubMed Google Scholar), we find no evidence for a transcriptional role in IL-13. However, we have identified two further GATA binding sites in the IL-5 promoter. One of these binding sites (at −152) acts like the −70 site. Mutagenesis significantly lowers IL-5 expression, indicating that the binding of GATA-3 is necessary for expression. Remarkably, the other site at −400 acts as a powerful repressor. Mutagenesis allows high level expression without the activation of other transcription factors normally required for IL-5 expression. This suggests that although GATA-3 appears to have some overriding control of the locus, it has unique transcriptional effects on IL-5, which may provide the basis for the specific regulation of IL-5 and the consequent eosinophilia. PER117 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 7.5% fetal calf serum (Trace Scientific, Victoria, Australia), 100 μm minimum Eagle’s medium non-essential amino acid solution (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2 mml-glutamine (Sigma), 75 μm monothioglycerol (Sigma), and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.3 (Life Technologies, Inc.). The pCR2–1hIL5p plasmid was used to isolate a 553-bp hIL5 promoter fragment. The fragment Bam HI (−509) to Eco RI (+44) from pCR2–1hIL5p was then subcloned in theBam HI/Eco RI site of the pALTER vector (Promega), producing plasmid pALTER-hIL5. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Altered Sites II in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega) with the oligonucleotides listed in TableI.

Following confirmation of mutations, the eight mutant and single wild-type hIL-5 fragments were isolated from the respective pALTER-hIL5 and pALTER-hIL5mut plasmids by Bam HI/Eco RI digest and ligated into the Bam HI/Eco RI sites of pSP72 (Promega) creating pSP-hIL5 and pSP-hIL5mut constructs. The pSP-hIL5 and pSP-hIL5mut constructs were subsequently digested withXba I and Bgl II, isolated, and ligated intoNhe I/Bgl II-digested pGL3-Basic (Promega). The resulting constructs were called hIL5p, hIL5–400c, hIL5–400nc, hIL-5–400cnc, hIL5–152, hIL5–128, hIL5–70c, hIL5–70nc, and hIL5–70cnc and were used for transfection experiments. Nuclear extracts used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and DNase I protection assays were prepared as described previously (24Mordvinov V.A. Schwenger G.T. Fournier R. De Boer M.L.

The probe used in DNase I protection assays was obtained by subcloning a DNA fragment covering the promoter sequence from positions −509 to +184 in the Sma I site of the vector pSP72 (Promega). The fragment was obtained from the construct pCR2–1hIL-5 (24Mordvinov V.A. Schwenger G.T. Fournier R. De Boer M.L. Peroni S.E. Singh A.D. Karlen S. Holland J.W. Sanderson C.J. J. Allergy Clin.

The fragment was excised with eitherSal I/Kpn I to allow selective 5′ labeling of the coding strand or by Eco RI/Pst I for the selective 5′ labeling of the non-coding strand. The DNase I protection assays, the labeling and purification of the probes, and the localization of the protected sequences on the coding and non-coding strands were performed as described previously (24Mordvinov V.A. Schwenger G.T. Fournier R. De Boer M.L. Peroni S.E. Singh A.D. Karlen S. Holland J.W. Sanderson C.J. J. Allergy Clin.

Naked DNA was incubated with 0.01 unit of DNase I (Life Technologies, Inc.) or 1.0 unit when incubated with proteins. EMSAs were performed as described previously (24Mordvinov V.A. Schwenger G.T. Fournier R. De Boer M.L. Peroni S.E. Singh A.D. Karlen S. Holland J.W. Sanderson C.J. J. Allergy Clin.

For competition experiments, double-stranded competitor oligonucleotides were added before the probe and incubated for a subsequent 20 min. For supershift experiments, the antisera were added before the probe and incubated for 1 h. Polyclonal antibodies against AP1, Oct-1, Oct-2, C/EBPβ, C/EBPε used in the supershift experiment were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. The anti-GATA-3 and GATA-4 antibodies were a generous gift from Dr. Tetsuya Yamagata (17Yamagata T. Nishida J. Sakai R. Tanaka T. Honda H. Hirano N. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3830-3839Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides used in EMSA are listed in Table I. Probe preparation, binding reactions, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were performed as described previously (25Karlen S. Beard P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4296-4306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EMSA pictures were generated by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics Inc.). All transfections were carried out in triplicate. 15 μg of DNA was electroporated at 960 μFd and 280 V into 107 PER117 cells in 400 μl of growth medium using the Bio-Rad gene pulser. After electroporation, the cells were incubated at 37 °C for a period of 6 h before activation. For T-cell activation, PMA (Sigma), cAMP (Sigma), and anti-Leu-CD28 (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems) were used at concentrations of 10 ng/ml, 1 mm, and 0.2 μg/ml, respectively. After an additional incubation period of 16 h, the cells were harvested and resuspended in 100 μl of reaction buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 15 mm MgSO4, 33.3 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 250 μm LiCoA (Sigma), 500 μm sodium-luciferin (Molecular Probes Inc.) and 0.5% Triton X-100. Luciferase activity was measured in a Victor 1420 multilabel reader (Wallac, Turku, Finland). The DNaseI protection experiments of the hIL-5 gene promoter from position −506 to −184 were performed with nuclear proteins extracted from the human T-cell line PER117 (26Mordvinov V. Peroni S. De Boer M. Kees U. Sanderson C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 228: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The DNaseI protection assay results are shown in Fig.1 and revealed the presence of three protected areas located from position −466 to −384. These sequences are protected by unstimulated nuclear extracts, and this protection is down-regulated in the presence of nuclear proteins extracted from PMA/cAMP-stimulated cells. The exact location of the protected sequence was identified by enzymatic sequencing of the probe used for the assays. The upstream sequence was identified as the hPRE2 element, whereas another region extending between positions −426 and −384 found to be highly protected is actually composed of two different regions, BR7 and BR6, separated by a 6–9-bp sequence. Both strands of the DNA are protected, although the protection occurs in a non-symmetrical manner. The BR6- and BR7-protected regions were analyzed for potential protein binding sites using the TFsearch program (27Heinemeyer T. Wingender E. Reuter I. Hermjakob H. Kel A.E. Kel O.V. Ignatieva E.V. Ananko E.A. Podkolodnaya O.A. Kolpakov F.A. Podkolodny N.L. Kolchanov N.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). As shown on Fig. 1, BR7 contains the consensus binding sites for the transcription factors Oct-1 and C/EBP. BR6 sequence analysis through the same program revealed two potential binding sites for a member of the GATA transcription factor family, each positioned in reverse orientation from the other and therefore found to be part of a GATA palindromic site (Fig. 1 B). The sites are not only remarkable by the fact that they are palindromic, but also because they are non-canonical (e.g. AGATTA instead of the AGATAR). In addition, the search revealed matches with consensus binding sites of Oct, AP-1, and C/EBP transcription factors in BR6. GATA has been shown to play no significant role in hIL-4 transcription (23Ranganath S. Ouyang W. Bhattarcharya D. Sha W.C. Grupe A. Peltz G. Murphy K.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3822-3826PubMed Google Scholar), and no information was available for hIL-13. Therefore, this promoter was analyzed using TFSearch (27Heinemeyer T. Wingender E. Reuter I. Hermjakob H. Kel A.E. Kel O.V. Ignatieva E.V. Ananko E.A. Podkolodnaya O.A. Kolpakov F.A. Podkolodny N.L. Kolchanov N.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar) along with the hIL-5 (−509 to +44) promoter for other potential GATA binding sites. Four potential sites were identified in the first 900 bp of the hIL-13 promoter: 1) hIL13GATAa (−87 to −78), 2) hIL13GATAb (−385 to −377), 3) hIL13GATAc (−694 to −686), and 4) hIL13GATAd (−884 to −876). Of these sites, hIL13GATAa, hIL13GATAb, and hIL13GATAd bound proteins from unstimulated and stimulated PER117 cells, but none of these were identified by competition or supershift EMSA as GATA proteins. Although the binding in the IL-5 promoter of GATA-3 protein at the site located at position −70 was well established in the mouse, it has never been clearly demonstrated in the human. Similar to the −400 GATA site, −70 GATA contains two sites arranged in repeated inverted orientation. In addition, the presence of an additional GATA binding site located further upstream has been reported a few years ago by Prieschl et al. (21Prieschl E.E. Gouilleux-Gruart V. Walker C. Harrer N.E. Baumruker T. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6112-6119PubMed Google Scholar). This site was described as being located between positions −177 and −80. A closer examination of this region showed that two potential sequences matching a consensus GATA binding site are present in this area. One was located at −128 and the other at −152. Both are in the same orientation and do not present any palindromic features (Fig. 2). DNaseI protection analysis of the proximal hIL-5 promoter identified the protection of the −152 but not the −128 site, and the −70 GATA site is also clearly protected (24Mordvinov V.A. Schwenger G.T. Fournier R. De Boer M.L. Peroni S.E. Singh A.D. Karlen S. Holland J.W. Sanderson C.J. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1999; 103: 1125-1135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). EMSA analysis was performed in order to identify experimentally the proteins protecting the BR6 and BR7 regions. The analysis was made with nuclear extract prepared from unstimulated PMA/cAMP- or PMA/CD28-stimulated PER117 cells. With all three extracts, the banding patterns obtained were the same, and only the results obtained with the PMA/cAMP-stimulated extracts are shown in Fig.3 A. A complete absence of binding is observed with BR7 probe (data not shown), but the strong protection of this sequence especially on the non-coding strand strongly suggests that this element is of importance (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). This is described under “Discussion.” When using the −400/BR6 oligonucleotide, two complexes are obtained (Fig. 3 A, lane 1). The two complexes are denominated −400L (low mobility complex) and −400H (high mobility complex) and are specific to the sequence, because they are completely competed by an excess of 50 times of unlabeled probe −400/BR6 but not the unrelated AP-2 oligonucleotide. The bands visible ahead of the described complexes are nonspecific binding, because they are not removed by the unlabeled probe competition or not constantly present. They will not be further considered. To identify the nature of the factors comprising complexes −400H and −400L, the competition with 50× excess unlabeled oligonucleotides containing the consensus binding sites of the factors described above (Fig. 3 A) were performed. The GATA consensus site oligonucleotide inhibits the formation of both complexes, although the inhibition is only partial for −400L (lane 3). C/EBP consensus site completely inhibits the formation of the −400H complex and affects partially −400L formation (lane 5). The Oct, AP-1, and AP-2 sequences were unable to interfere with the formation of any of the complexes (lanes 4, 6, and 7). The identification of the proteins binding on the BR6 sequence was achieved by supershift experiments utilizing specific antibodies against two members of the GATA transcription factor family, GATA-3 and -4, as well as antibodies raised against the factors C/EPBβ and C/EPBε and Oct-1 and -2. Anti-GATA-3 antibodies were able to inhibit both −400 complexes (Fig. 3 A, lane 8), whereas anti-GATA-4 antibodies were unable to produce a shift. The other antibodies were unable to shift either of the −400 complexes (data not shown). These results clearly indicate that the complexes formed on the BR6 sequence contain GATA-3 proteins. To further characterize the GATA binding ability of the two sites present at positions −399 and −393, EMSA experiments were performed with oligonucleotides containing the mutations of one, the other, or both GATA sites present in BR6 sequence. For convenience of identification, the GATA site located on the coding strand was named GATAc, and the GATA site located on the non-coding strand was called GATAnc. As shown on Fig. 3 B, a disruption of the GATA-coding strand sequence (AGATTA to ACTTTA) does not impair the binding of GATA protein (lane 2), when the same mutation made on GATA non-coding strand prevents the binding of the probe (lane 3). The double mutant presents the same binding pattern as the GATA non-coding mutant (lane 4). Thus, only the site located on the negative strand of the palindromic sequence is able to bind GATA factors. Three probes were designed spanning the −70, −128, and −152 GATA sites. The ability of these double-stranded oligonucleotides to bind proteins from PER117 cells was analyzed by EMSA. As shown on Fig.4, A and B, respectively, both −70 GATA and −152 GATA are able to give rise to two complexes of similar mobility to −400H and −400L. In contrast, the −128 GATA site was unable to form complexes with PER117 nuclear extracts (data not shown). The use of antibodies against GATA proteins shows that the complexes, as described previously for −400 GATA, contain GATA-3 protein but not GATA-4 (Fig. 4, A and B). The high mobility complex obtained with −70 GATA probe was not altered by the anti-GATA antiserum. To assess the activity of the GATA elements in the context of the 509-bp promoter, a study by site-directed mutagenesis was performed. The three −400 GATA site mutations described previously (m-400GATAnc, m-400GATAc, and m-400GATAcnc) for which the binding ability of GATA proteins was verified (Fig. 3 B) were introduced into the hIL-5 509-bp promoter. Similar mutations were made in the −70 palindromic GATA site. The two single non-palindromic GATA sites at positions −128 and −152 were also mutated. All mutations were tested in EMSA and shown to abolish GATA binding to these sites (data not shown). Mutant expression constructs were transfected into PER117 cells as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and luciferase activity was determined after 16-h stimulation with or without PMA and cAMP or PMA and anti-CD28. Fig. 5, A and B, show a dramatic reduction in hIL-5 promoter activity upon the mutation of the non-coding strand −70 GATA site. Expression was reduced to 7% of the wild-type level in PMA/cAMP-stimulated cells and 9% of the wild-type level in PMA/CD28-stimulated cells, whereas the mutation of the coding strand −70 GATA site only had a nominal effect on expression. Mutation of both sites together showed a similar result to the single mutation in the non-coding −70 GATA site. As expected, the mutation of the −128 GATA (Fig. 5, C and D) site did not result in any significant change in hIL-5 promoter activity. In contrast, the mutation of the −152 GATA site reduced expression to 18% of wild-type levels under PMA/cAMP stimulation (Fig. 5 C) and 14% of wild-type levels under PMA/CD28 stimulation (Fig. 5 D).Figure 5Biological Activity of −70, −152, and −400 GATA sites in hIL-5. Transfection of mutant hIL-5 promoter reporter constructs was carried out in PER117 cells. Luciferase activity was determined after 16 h with and without 16 h of stimulation with 10 μg/ml PMA and 1 mm cAMP or 10 μg/ml PMA and 0.2 μg/ml anti-CD28.

Individual mutation of the GATA sites on opposite strands had no effect on hIL-5 promoter expression. In contrast, mutation of both the coding and non-coding strands together resulted in a 2–3-fold increase of stimulated activity and, more importantly, up to a 250-fold increase in unstimulated activity of the hIL-5 promoter. This dramatic change increased constitutive expression to 1.54 ± 0.27 times the level of"

The two genes encoding d-ornithine aminomutase have been cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli. TheoraS gene, which encodes a protein of 121 amino acid residues with Mr 12,800, is situated upstream of the oraE gene, which encodes a protein of 753 amino acid residues with Mr 82,900. The holoenzyme appears to comprise a α2β2-heterotetramer. OraS shows no significant homology to other proteins in the Swiss-Prot data base. The deduced amino acid sequence of OraE includes a conserved base-off/histidine-on cobalamin-binding motif, DXHXXG. OraE was expressed in E. coli as inclusion bodies. Refolding experiments on OraE indicate that the interactions between OraS and OraE and the binding of either pyridoxal phosphate or adenosylcobalamin play important roles in refolding process. The Km values ford-ornithine, 5′-deoxyadenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl), and pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) are 44.5 ± 2.8, 0.43 ± 0.04, and 1.5 ± 0.1 μm, respectively; thekcat is 6.3 ± 0.1 s−1. The reaction was absolutely dependent upon OraE, OraS, AdoCbl, PLP, andd-ornithine being present in the assay; no other cofactors were required. A red-shift in UV-visible absorption spectrum is observed when free adenosylcobinamide is bound by recombinantd-ornithine aminomutase and no significant change in spectrum when free adenosylcobinamide is bound by mutant OraE-H618G, demonstrating that the enzyme binds adenosylcobalamin in base-off/histidine-on mode. d-Ornithine aminomutase fromClostridium sticklandii catalyzes the reversible rearrangement of d-ornithine to (2R,4S)-2,4-diaminopentanoic acid.

Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 23-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). In this reaction, alanine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, histidine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan can generally be used as electron donors, whereas proline, glycine, ornithine, and arginine serve as electron acceptors (2Ljungdahl, L. G., Hugenholtz, J., and Wiegel, J. (1989) inClostridia (Mintoz, N. P., and Clarke, D. P., eds) Chapter 5, Plenum Press, New York.Google Scholar). The catabolism of ornithine in Clostridium sticklandii, a Gram-positive anaerobe, is of great interest, because it can be accomplished by two different pathways. Either ornithine can be reduced to 5-aminovaleric acid through the formation of l- and d-proline as intermediates or it can be oxidized to acetate, alanine, and ammonia. In the latter oxidation pathway, l-ornithine is first converted to d-ornithine by ornithine racemase, which has recently been purified and characterized by our group (3Chen H.P. Lin C.F. Lee Y.R. Tsay S.S. Wu S.H. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2052-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This pathway is also found in C. subterminales (4Andreesen, J. R., Bahl, H., and Gottschalk, G. (1989) inClostridia (Mintoz, N. P., and Clarke, D. P., eds) Chapter 2, Plenum Press, New York.Google Scholar). d-Ornithine aminomutase (EC 5.4.3.5) catalyzes the reversible interconversion of d-ornithine to (2R,4S)-2,4-diaminopentanoic acid as the second step in the oxidation pathway of l-ornithine in C. sticklandii. The enzyme is one of a group of adenosylcobalamin-dependent enzymes that catalyzes unusual isomerizations in which a substituent group is interchanged with a hydrogen atom from an adjacent carbon atom. It comprises two strongly associating subunits, S and E, with molecular masses of 12,800 Da and 90,000 Da, respectively, as judged by SDS-PAGE.1 Its molecular weight has been estimated by gel filtration to be about 200,000 (5Baker J.J. Stadtman T.C. Dolphin D. B12. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1984: 203-231Google Scholar), suggesting that it is a heterotetramer. The apoenzyme combines with adenosylcobalamin and pyridoxal phosphate to form the active holoenzyme. AdoCbl is generally accepted to act as a radical initiator through the enzyme-promoted cleavage of its cobalt–carbon bond. The adenosyl radical then abstracts a hydrogen atom from either the substrate or a protein residue. In the case of carbon-skeleton mutases and aminomutases, a 1,2-rearrangement of the subsequently formed substrate radical is catalyzed. The crystal structures of the cobalamin-binding domains of methionine synthase, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, and glutamate mutase have been determined. In each case, the pseudo-nucleotide tail of cobalamin has swung away from the corrin and is replaced as a ligand to cobalt by the imidazole group of a histidine residue (6Drennen C.L. Huang S. Drummond J.T. Matthews R.G. Ludwig M.K. Science. 1994; 266: 1669-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 7Manica F. Keep N.H. Nakagawa A. Leadlay P.F. McSweeney S. Rasmussen B. Bosecke P.

Structure Fold Des. 1999; 7: 891-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (192) Google Scholar). This key histidine residue is present in a conserved motif, DXHXXG, which is also found in other AdoCbl-dependent carbon-skeleton mutases and aminomutases (9Marsh E.N.G. Holloway D.E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). PLP plays a pivotal role in the migration of the amino group between adjacent carbon atoms. The migrating amino group is believed to form a Schiff base with PLP (10Morley C.G.D. Stadtman T.C. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 600-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Like acyl-CoA mutases, the migration probably proceeds through a cyclic transition state (11Frey P.A. Reed G.H. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas. Mol. Biol. 1993; 66: 1-39PubMed Google Scholar). This mechanistic picture is strongly supported by a non-enzymatic mode study and quantum chemical calculations (12Han O. Frey P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 8982-8983Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 13Wetmore S.D. Smith D.M. Radom L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 122: 10208-10209Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The reactions catalyzed by d-ornithine andd-α-lysine aminomutase are remarkably similar. Early studies indicated that d-α-lysine aminomutase is a single-protein complex but that it catalyzes the rearrangement of two different substrates, d-α-lysine andl-β-lysine. It is composed of a catalytic component, E1, and a regulatory component, E2. There are three non-identical subunits in the E1 component with molecular masses of 30,000, 51,000, and 12,800 Da. Interestingly, bothd-ornithine and d-α-lysine aminomutase contain a small 12,800-Da subunit, and their amino acid compositions are virtually identical (5Baker J.J. Stadtman T.C. Dolphin D. B12. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1984: 203-231Google Scholar). The genes encoding d-lysine aminomutase in C. sticklandii have recently been cloned and sequenced (14Chang C.H. Frey P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 106-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The kamD and kamE genes encode polypeptides of 57,261 and 29,191Da, respectively, and are adjacent on the clostridial chromosome. However, the recombinant enzyme, even in the absence of the small subunit reported by Baker and Stadtman (5Baker J.J. Stadtman T.C. Dolphin D. B12. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1984: 203-231Google Scholar), is still catalytically active. Therefore, the real role of the small subunit in d-α-lysine ord-ornithine aminomutase remains unknown. We now describe the cloning and sequencing of oraS and oraE, the genes encoding components S and E of d-ornithine aminomutase, from C. sticklandii, together with the overexpression of OraS and OraE in Escherichia coli, and the purification, refolding, and initial characterization of the recombinant proteins. AdoCbl was obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. AdoCbi was the kind gift of Prof. Hui-Lan Chen (Department of Chemistry, Nanjing University, People's Republic of China). Q-Sepharose High Performance (HP) anion-exchange medium, SP-Sepharose HP cation-exchange medium, Sephacryl-S-200-HR gel filtration medium, Phenyl-Sepharose HP hydrophobic interaction gel medium, and a Mono-Q column were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Restriction endonucleasesXbaI, BamHI, EcoRI, NdeI,HindIII, and NcoI; DNA-modifying enzymes; and ExTaq DNA polymerase were purchased from TaKaRa. The kits used for non-radioactive labeling and detection (AlkPhos direct labeling system and CDP-Star detection system) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The LA PCR in vitro cloning kit was from TaKaRa. The E. coli strain BL21(DE3) codon plus was from Stratagene. All chemicals used were of molecular biology grade or higher. C. sticklandii (ATCC 12662) cells were grown in a medium consisting of 0.6% Tryptone, 0.6% yeast extract, 10 μm CoCl2, 10 μm MnCl2, 10 μmNa2MoSO4, 100 mm MgCl2, 100 mm CaCl2, and 1% l-arginine hydrochloride in 40 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). The medium was used immediately after autoclaving to keep its oxygen content to a minimum. Provided the culture vessel was filled to the neck, an anaerobic atmosphere was unnecessary. Each batch of medium was inoculated with a 5% inoculum of an actively growing culture and was incubated at 37 °C in the dark for 12–16 h. The cell paste was frozen as soon as it was removed from the centrifuge and was stored at −20 °C until used. All purification steps were performed on ice or at 4 °C. In a typical purification, 15 g of cells (wet weight) was resuspended in 60 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The cells were ruptured in a volume of 30 ml by sonication. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 25,000 ×g for 15 min, and the supernatant was brought to 25% saturation in ammonium sulfate by slow addition of solid. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 25,000 ×g for 30 min, and the supernatant was directly applied to a Phenyl-Sepharose HP hydrophobic interaction column (2.6 × 25 cm) equilibrated in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm DTT, 1 m(NH4)2SO4, and 10% glycerol. After washing the column with 100 ml of the same buffer, the enzyme was eluted with a 1inear, descending gradient of ammonium sulfate in 1000 ml of buffer. The flow rate was 1 ml/min; 10-ml fractions were collected. Active fractions were pooled and concentrated to 15 ml by ultrafiltration in a stirred cell fitted with a PM-30 membrane. After overnight dialysis against 1 liter of 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer containing 10% glycerol, pH 6.4, the protein was loaded onto a 2.6- × 20-cm Q-Sepharose Fast Flow anion-exchange column equilibrated with the same buffer. Protein was eluted with a 600-ml gradient from 0 to 0.5 m KCl. The flow rate was 1 ml/min; 5-ml fractions were collected. Active fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight against 1 liter of 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer containing 10% glycerol, pH 6.4. Final purification was achieved by fast-protein liquid chromatography using a Mono Q HR5/5 column. Protein was applied to the column equilibrated in 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.4, and eluted with a 20-ml gradient from 0 to 0.5 m KCl. The flow rate was 1 ml/min; 0.4-ml fractions were collected. The protein solution was concentrated by ultrafiltration and stored at −20 °C in the presence of 50% glycerol. To determine the N-terminal sequences of the both components, S and E, of d-ornithine aminomutase, the protein solution from above was subjected to SDS-PAGE through a 5–20% gradient gel. Polypeptides were then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by electroblotting and stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 for 40 s. After partial destaining, the desired bands were cut out for N-terminal sequencing. The N-terminal sequences obtained were as follows: S component, MKRADDFQQRRAHLANLSDEELQTR; and E component, MEKDLQLRVNEKLDVENILKDLDKTT. Two oligonucleotides, nos. 21 and 23 (TableI), were designed based on the N-terminal sequences of the S and E components for use as primers in a degenerate PCR experiment. Genomic DNA was purified from C. sticklandiiby phenol/chloroform extraction methods (15Saito H. Miura K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 72: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar). The PCR reaction was carried out by using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 480 thermal cycler as follows: 1 min at 94 °C, 1.5 min at 41 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C. After 35 cycles, a clear ∼400-bp PCR product was obtained. The gel-purified PCR product was sequenced on both DNA strands to confirm that the PCR reaction had amplified the correct region of genomic DNA and was directly used as a probe.Table IPCR primersPrimer nameSequence21ATG AAA (AC)GA GC(AT) GAT GAT TTT CAA CA23ATA TTT TC(AT) ACA TCT A(AG)T TTT TCA TT33AAT AGT TGA TCC ATT ACT GGA TTT AGG34TTG CAT TAA GTG AAG GCA AGT ACT GGG35CCA GCA CCT TTT CCC ATA AGC CCT36CCC TAA ATC CAG TAA TGG ATC AAC37GGG TCT AGA ATC GAA AAA GAT CTA CAG TTA AGA38CCA TAA TCC ACT CCA CCT GCT AAA39GGG GAA TTC CAT ATG AAA AGA GCA GAT GAT TTT CAA40CCC GGA TCC TTA TTT TAC TCC TCC TTT41GCG CGC CAT GGA AAA AGA TCT ACA GTT AAG A42GGG GGA TCC CCA TAA TCC ACT CCA CCT GCT AAA43ACC AAC TGA ACC CTC ATC TTC TCC TAC AG44GAA GAT GAG GGT TCA GTT GGT CTA AGA GAPrimer names and sequences.

Genomic DNA from C. sticklandii was restricted with XbaI orHindIII. The DNA fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, blotted onto a positively charged nylon membrane, and hybridized with the probe using the AlkPhos direct labeling system. After chemiluminescence detection with CDP-Star detection reagent, ∼6- and 2.4-kb bands were detected within XbaI- andHindIII-restricted clostridial genomic DNA, respectively. The LA PCR in vitro cloning kit was directly used to clone the coding regions for the subunits of d-ornithine aminomutase. A 3.0-kb DNA fragment located on the downstream side of the probe DNA was amplified by two rounds of PCR reactions with the use of oligonucleotides 33 and 34 as primers and XbaI-restricted clostridial genomic DNA as template. Accordingly, a 1.2-kb DNA fragment located on the upstream side of the probe was amplified with the use of oligonucleotides 35 and 36 as primers and HindIII-restricted clostridial genomic DNA as template. All experimental steps and PCR conditions were carefully carried out according to the kit manufacturer's instructions. Both fragments amplified by PCR experiments were gel-purified and partially sequenced by automated methods. Based on the sequence obtained from the above two DNA fragments, the coding regions for the S and E subunits ofd-ornithine aminomutase were amplified by PCR reaction using following pairs of oligonucleotides, 39/40 and 37/38, as primers and Clostridial genomic DNA as template. Amplification was achieved using 30 cycles at the following temperatures: 95 °C for 0.5 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 4 min. Finally, the reaction was maintained at 72 °C for 5 min. The PCR products were gel-purified and sequenced on both strands using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences DNA autosequencer. The oraS gene was amplified by PCR using two primers, 39 and 40, which introduced NdeI and BamHI sites at the 5′ and 3′ termini of theoraS gene, respectively. The PCR product was gel-purified using a Qiagen gel-extraction kit, restricted with NdeI andBamHI, and ligated withNdeI/BamHI-restricted pT7-7 vector. The ligation mixture was used to transform E. coli TG1 recO 1504::Tn5. The plasmid that carried the oraS gene in the correct orientation was designated poraSX. Similarly, theoraE gene was PCR-amplified using primers, 41 and 42, which introduced NcoI and BamHI sites at the 5′and 3′ termini of the oraE gene, respectively. The PCR product was purified, restricted with NcoI and BamHI, and ligated with NcoI/BamHI-restricted pET-28a vector. The resulting plasmid containing the oraE gene was designated poraEX. To facilitate the overexpression of the ora genes, poraSX and poraEX were used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3) codon plus. Cultures were grown at 37 °C by inoculating 5-ml overnight culture into 1 liter of LB medium containing the appropriate antibiotic, 100 mg/liter ampicillin for pOraSX or 30 mg/liter kanamycin for pOraEX. Incubation was continued until the culture reached an A600 of between 0.8 and 1, at which point expression was induced by the addition of 200 mg/liter isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. All purification steps were performed on ice or at 4 °C. In a typical purification, 15 g of cells (wet weight) were resuspended in 50 ml of 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The cells were ruptured in a total volume of 30 ml by sonication. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was filtrated through a 0.22-μm syringe filter and loaded onto a 2.6 × 20 cm SP-Sepharose HP cation-exchange column equilibrated with 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Protein was then eluted with a 600-ml gradient ascending from 0 to 0.5m KCl. The flow rate was 1 ml/min; 5.5-ml fractions were collected. Fractions containing OraS protein were pooled and concentrated to 7 ml by ultrafiltration in a stirred cell fitted with a PM-3 membrane. The concentrated protein solution was then applied to a Sephacryl-S200-HR gel filtration column (2.6 × 90 cm) equilibrated in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Fractions containing the major protein peak, which comprised pure OraS, were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration as described above. The protein solution was stored at −20 °C in the presence of 50% glycerol. OraE protein was expressed in an insoluble form at 37 °C. All purification steps were performed on ice or at 4 °C. In a typical purification, 15 g of cells (wet weight) were resuspended in 50 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA. The cells were ruptured in a total volume of 30 ml by sonication. The insoluble fraction was collected by centrifugation at 25,000 ×g for 15 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was washed twice with 25 ml of the same buffer supplemented with 0.5% Triton X-100 to remove lipophilic contaminants. Each wash was followed by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was solubilized in 25 ml of 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 10 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA. The solution was stirred at room temperature for 2 h and cleared by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 15 min. After this, the purity of the OraE was better than 90% as judged by SDS-PAGE. No steps were taken to further purify OraE before refolding. The supernatant was used as the stock solution for refolding experiments and stored at −70 °C. The protein concentration of OraE in the stock solution was estimated from a Coomassie Blue-stained 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. All steps were performed at 4 °C or on ice. About 3.8 mg of OraS in 2 ml of 50% glycerol and 9.1 mg of OraE in 3-ml stock solution were added dropwise to 100 ml of 0.1m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1m guanidine hydrochloride, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm DTT, with gentle stirring. After the solution was stirred for a further 20 min, about 400 μl of 12 mm PLP or 100 μl of 2 mm adenosylcobalamin was added. The solution was then dialyzed overnight against 3 × 2 liters of 0.1m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 10% glycerol and 1 mm DTT in the dark. The dialysate was then cleared by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 15 min and concentrated to 20 ml by ultrafiltration in a stirred cell fitted with a YM 3 membrane. To remove excess OraS and other contaminating components, the refolded enzyme was then loaded onto a Q-Sepharose HP anion-exchange column (2.6 × 20 cm), equilibrated in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, which contained 10% glycerol and 1 mm DTT. The column was first washed with 50 ml of the same buffer, and proteins were then eluted with a 500-ml linear gradient of 0–0.5 m KCl. The flow rate was 2 ml/min; 6-ml fractions were collected. Active fractions were pooled and concentrated to 8 ml by ultrafiltration as described above. The protein solution was stored at −20 °C in the presence of 50% glycerol. The construction of mutant,poraEX-H618G, was carried out using recombinant PCR (16Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Application. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1990: 177-183Google Scholar). Two overlapping, complementary oligonucleotides, 43 and 44, were designed to introduce the mutagenic sequence. A 1.9-kb and 300-bp region of the oraE gene was PCR-amplified using pmutEX as template and oligo-41/44 and -42/43 as primers. Both PCR products were gel-purified and assembled in a second-round PCR reaction using oligo-41 and -42 as primers and co-templates. The PCR product was purified, restricted with NcoI and BamHI, and ligated with NcoI/BamHI-restricted pET-28a vector. The resulting plasmid was designated poraEX-H618G. The procedures for expression and purification of the mutant protein were the same as that of the wild type. The mutant protein was refolded in the presence of OraS and PLP. The protein concentrations of purified OraS and refolded d-ornithine aminomutase were determined by Bradford assay using purified cobalamin-binding domain, glutamate mutase component S (MutS) as the standard (17Bradford M.M.

The molecular mass of refolded recombinant d-ornithine aminomutase was estimated by gel filtration chromatography using a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech pre-packed Superdex 200 HR10/30 column equilibrated in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.5, containing 150 mm NaCl. The analysis was performed on a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AKTAbasic 10 system. The proteins were eluted isocratically with the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Calibration standards were (in daltons) blue dextran (2,000,000), thyroglobulin (669,000), apoferritin (443,000), β-amylase (200,000), glutamate mutase component E (107,000), and glutamate mutase component S (14,000). A rapid spectrophotometric method was used to assay d-ornithine aminomutase activity (18Tsuda Y. Friedmann H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 5914-5926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay couples the formation of 2,4-diaminopentanoic acid to reduction of NADP+ through the action of 2,4-diaminopentanoic acid dehydrogenase. The enzymatic activity was assayed by monitoring at 340 nm the production of NADPH. The assay solution was buffered by 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5. The reagents were added into the assay solution in the following order: coupling enzyme, 0.5 mmNADP+, AdoCbl, PLP, and d-ornithine aminomutase. After mixing and incubating in the dark for 10 s, the reaction was initiated by addition of d-ornithine. After mixing by hand for about 10 s, the rate was steady for about 1.5 min. This assay was carried out at room temperature in dim light to protect the coenzymes. A computer program (Kalieda Graph, Abelbeck Software) was used to fit data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. For each measurement, 600-μl protein solutions containing 100 μm OraE or OraE-H618G and 250 μm OraS in 0.1 m Tris-Cl buffer, pH 8.5, were mixed with a 1.5-μl solution containing 2 mmadenosylcobinamide. After incubating in the dark for 2 min, spectra were recorded using a spectrophotometer (Hitachi U-3000). From the N-terminal protein sequences obtained for components S and E, two oligonucleotides were designed to function as primers in a PCR experiment, the expectation being that both components would be transcribed as part of the same operon. Fortunately, this assumption proved correct. The S component of the enzyme is encoded upstream of the E component. The nucleotide sequence and deduced protein sequence of the oragenes are shown in Fig. 1. Although the stop codon of oraS and start codon of oraE are overlapped, a potential Shine-Dalgarno sequence is present upstream of both oraS and oraE. Downstream, ora Eis followed by a gene, which encodes a protein of 59 amino acid residues with unknown function. The oraS gene encodes a protein of 121 amino acid residues with Mr 12,800, whereas the oraE gene encodes 753 amino acid residues with Mr 82,900. The apparent molecular weight of recombinant d-ornithine aminomutase was determined to be about 201,000, which is in accord with previous results obtained from native enzyme (5Baker J.J. Stadtman T.C. Dolphin D. B12. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1984: 203-231Google Scholar). Therefore, the holoenzyme appears to be a α2β2-heterotetramer. OraS shows no significant homology to other proteins in the Swiss-Prot data base. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of oraE to those of known AdoCbl-dependent carbon-skeleton mutases and aminomutases reveals the presence of a conserved cobalamin-binding domain at the C terminus of OraE protein. Notably, the appearance of the conserved614GXDXHXXG621motif in the middle of the cobalamin-binding domain suggests that d-ornithine aminomutase binds AdoCbl in a base-off/histidine-on mode. In addition, the gene sequence oforaE, perhaps unsurprisingly, has a high sequence similarity to that of kamD and kamE. The deduced amino acid sequence of oraE showed 28% identity and 39% similarity tokamD and 35% identity and 47% similarity tokamE (Fig. 2). It is interesting to note that the E component has excess Glu and Asp relative to Arg, Lys, and His, whereas the S component has excess Arg, Lys, and His relative to Glu and Asp. The protocol described under “Experimental Procedures” gave good expression of OraS. Approximately 20 mg of purified protein was obtained per liter of culture. We developed a new purification based on chromatography on SP-Sepharose HP cation-exchange matrix. After disruption of cells by sonication, the crude cell extract was directly loaded onto a column of ion-exchange matrix. A large peak of nucleic acids and contaminating proteins eluted first followed by a smaller peak containing many other proteins. OraS eluted next in a well-resolved broad peak; this step resulted in protein that was nearly homogeneous (Fig.3 A). Finally, the minor contaminating component was removed by use of a Sephacryl S-200-HR gel filtration column (2.6 × 90 cm). The purification work of OraS was summarized in Table II. This method of preparation proved very reproducible, and OraS could be stored in a concentrated solution in the presence of 50% glycerol at −20 °C.Table IIPurification of OraS proteinPurification stepProtein concentrationVolumeProteinmg/mlmlmgCrude extract9.0625226.5SP-Sepharose HP0.865446.53Sephacryl S-2000.795039.45 Open table in a new tab In contrast to OraS, our efforts to express OraE protein in E. coli were frustrated. TheoraE gene was first subcloned into the pBluescript SK vector. The gene was placed under the control of the lac uv5 promoter. The resulting construct was used to transform E. coli TG1 recO 1504::Tn5. The expression of the gene was induced by addition of IPTG into exponentially growing cultures. The molecular weight of overexpressed protein was estimated to be about 78,000, a little lower than the molecular weight of the native enzyme from C. sticklandii as judged by SDS-PAGE. The expressed protein was exclusively found in the soluble fraction in the crude cell extract. However, the purified truncated OraE was inactive and unable to bind AdoCbl (data not shown). We therefore decided to seek another system to express the OraE protein. The second system we used to express the OraE protein was the well-known pET vector. Two oligonucleotides were designed to amplify the coding sequence of the oraE gene in a PCR experiment and to inc"

Several actin-monomer sequestering proteins have been identified that are responsible for maintaining this pool, and attempts have been made to account for the quantity of unpolymerized actin by calculation of the sum of sequestered actin in cells (1Southwick F.S. Young C.L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1965-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 2Cassimeris L. Safer D. Nachmias V.T. Zigmond S.H. J.

Struct. 2000; 29: 545-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). These calculations depend not only on the concentration of each sequestering protein and its equilibrium dissociation constant for actin, but also on several other parameters, including an estimate of the critical concentration of actin (i.e. the amount of unpolymerized, unsequestered actin), the stoichiometry with which the sequestering proteins bind to actin, the potential qualitative and quantitative effects should different sequestering proteins interact simultaneously with a single actin subunit, and on assumptions regarding the effects of cytoplasmic molecular crowding on equilibrium association constants. Not surprisingly, with so many parameters to evaluate, even small quantitative errors in measurement or qualitative errors in mechanism result in a wide range of plausible estimates of total sequestered actin. In this report we investigate assumptions that have very significant effects on predictions related to the amount of sequestered actin, finding significant discrepancies with previously reported results, and discuss the expected consequences of these observations.Based on assays measuring steady-state F-actin levels and the failure to obtain a covalently cross-linked ternary complex, thymosin β4 and profilin have been reported to bind competitively to actin (4Giehl K.

These results were consistent with data that suggested that the N terminus of thymosin β4 and profilin both bind to similar locations in subdomain 1 of actin (7Vandekerckhove J.S. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 8Schutt C.E. Myslik J.C. Rozycki M.D. Goonesekere N.C. Lindberg U.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4739-4746Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The assumption of competitive binding between thymosin β4 and profilin is significant because it underlies models of actin polymerization that show profilin and thymosin β4 sequentially interacting with actin (10Chen H. Bernstein B.W. Bamburg J.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 19-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Also, this assumption has been used as the basis for the analysis of data concerning putative functions of profilin other than monomer sequestration (5Ballweber E. Giehl K. Hannappel E. Huff T. Jockusch B.M. Mannherz H.G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 6Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F.

Chem. 1999; 274: 36963-36972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, the recent evidence that the surface of interaction between thymosin β4 and actin is extensive, involving both subdomains 1 and 2 of actin (12Safer D. Sosnick T.R. Elzinga M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5806-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar,13De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Brundage R.A. Reddy K.S. Sweeney H.L. Safer D. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2516-2527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), implies that there is no structural basis for competitive binding between these actin-binding proteins, and has lead us to re-investigate the hypothesis that profilin and thymosin β4 could form a ternary complex with actin. Additional support for this hypothesis is provided by data showing that some variations in the C terminus of thymosin β4 alter actin affinity and explain, in part, the differences in actin binding activity of β-thymosin isoforms (14Huff T. Muller C.S. Hannappel E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar,15Eadie J.S. Kim S.W. Allen P.G. Hutchinson L.M. Kantor J.D. Zetter B.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 77: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Such data imply that while binding of the N terminus of thymosin β4 to actin may present a steric hindrance to profilin-actin interactions, additional interactions between the C terminus of thymosin β4 and actin could be independent or even augmented by profilin-actin interaction.While thymosin β4 is mostly or completely random coil in aqueous solution, much evidence suggests that the N terminus (residues 5–16) binds to actin in an α-helical conformation (16Czisch M. Schleicher M. Horger S. Voelter W. Holak T.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 17Zarbock J. Oschkinat H. Hannappel E. Kalbacher H. Voelter W. Holak T.A.

Trifluoroethanol stabilizes the α-helical conformation and enhances actin binding affinity in a manner consistent with the postulated change in entropy (18Feinberg J. Heitz F. Benyamin Y. Roustan C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). De La Cruz et al. (13De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Brundage R.A. Reddy K.S. Sweeney H.L. Safer D. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2516-2527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) have recently investigated the thermodynamics of the interaction between thymosin β4 and actin, and report evidence that the conformational transition may also involve changes in actin conformation. The molecular interactions of unfolded proteins, such as thymosin β4, with ligand have been proposed by Wright and Dyson (20Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (2298) Google Scholar) to provide regulatory control over critical cellular functions, and indeed, in addition to its actin-binding properties, thymosin β4 exhibits complex biological activities related to immunosuppression and hematopoesis (21Huang W.Q. Wang Q.R. Exp. Hematol. 2001; 29: 12-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 22Young J.D. Lawrence A.J. MacLean A.G. Leung B.P. McInnes I.B. Canas B. Pappin D.J.

Hematol. 1996; 24: 776-782PubMed Google Scholar). Presumably these diverse signaling pathways require multiple binding partners, a situation made possible by the potential of thymosin β4 to adopt induced structural motifs selective and specific for diverse ligands. In the current report, we describe observations regarding the rate and mechanism by which thymosin β4 may effect these conformational transitions.DISCUSSIONPrevious methods used to detect the presence of a ternary complex between profilin, thymosin β4, and actin were unsuccessful. Methods employing steady-state measurements of F-actin concentrations were not sensitive to differences between competitive and noncompetitive binding. Covalent cross-linking also failed to detect the ternary complex, but several explanations are possible. The site of covalent cross-linking on actin could have been identical for both profilin and thymosin β4, so that both could not cross-link simultaneously even if both were bound, or more subtly, profilin may alter the interface of the interaction of thymosin β4 and actin so that thymosin β4 no longer cross-links to actin. Our data which imply competition between the profilin and the N-terminal thymosin β4 peptide (Fig.6 B) suggests that the latter explanation is reasonable. Alternatively, one of the many demonstrable allosteric effects of profilin (26Yarmola E.G. Somasundaram T. Boring T.A. Spector I. Bubb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28120-28127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) may be to alter actin conformation so as to decrease the efficiency with which thymosin β4 cross-links to actin.The concentrations of thymosin β4 and profilin varies in different cells, with as much as 560 μm thymosin β4 and 55 μm profilin in platelets (38Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Machesky L.M. Doberstein S.K. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1081-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar,43Nachmias V.T. Cassimeris L. Golla R. Safer D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 61: 314-320PubMed Google Scholar), and perhaps more typically, embryonic chick brain has 50–60 μm thymosin β4 and 5–6 μmprofilin (44Devineni N. Minamide L.S. Niu M. Safer D. Verma R. Bamburg J.R. Nachmias V.T. Brain Res. 1999; 823: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These concentrations are sufficiently high that given a value of K d PT of 2 to 8 μm, it is likely that significant amounts of the sequestered actin, indeed, most of it in some cells, is present as ternary complex. The functional significance of this finding remains to be elucidated. We have estimated the nucleotide exchange rate of the ternary complex as similar to that of actin alone, but we have no information regarding its effect on nucleation, capping, and filament elongation.These results provide a possible resolution to the paradox as to how significant amounts of actin can be sequestered assuming that molecular crowding lowers the critical concentration of actin in vivo. That is, if the intracellular critical concentration of actin is as low as predicted by experimental data reflecting the molecularly crowded environment of the cytoplasm, then profilin or thymosin β4 acting alone or together would be able to sequester only small amounts of actin. However, if binding is noncompetitive, then because of the disparity between c and the equilibrium dissociation constants for profilin and thymosin β4, these proteins will act synergistically to form ternary complex. This is illustrated in Fig. 7 in an example relevant to human polymorphonuclear cells in which the concentrations of profilin and thymosin β4 are ∼40 and 150 μm, respectively (2Cassimeris L. Safer D. Nachmias V.T. Zigmond S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1261-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This observation provides other potential mechanisms for regulating actin sequestration. Whereas competitive binding results in a shallow linear increase in sequestered actin with increasing profilin, noncompetitive binding results in a steep dependence on profilin concentration that cells could readily regulate, for example, by regulation of production or turnover of polyphosphoinositides, another ligand of profilin.We observe that the equilibrium dissociation constant for profilin-actin reported here is lower than often reported in the literature. However, the range of reported results for mammalian profilin is quite large. Gutsche-Perelroizen (30Perelroizen I. Marchand J.B. Blanchoin L. Didry D. Carlier M.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8472-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) obtainedK d P = 0.12 μm by intrinsic fluorescence measurements on polyproline-purified bovine profilin, andK d P = 0.13 to 0.15 μm from metal nucleotide exchange experiments (45Perelroizen I. Carlier M.F. Pantaloni D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1501-1508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Selden et al.(46Selden L.A. Kinosian H.J. Estes J.E. Gershman L.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2769-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) obtained K d P = 0.60 μm from data for nucleotide exchange.There are several possibilities that can explain why the intact thymosin β4 peptide binds more rapidly to actin than does the N-terminal peptide. The C terminus could augment the rate of conversion from unfolded to a folded, binding competent, intermediate in solution, or could orient the peptide so as to catalyze a zipper effect where the N terminus binds quickly after the C terminus is bound, or could catalyze a conformational change in actin that facilitates rapid binding. The explanation for the slow dissociation rate constant of N-terminal peptide restricts these possibilities. An orientation effect in which the C terminus lines up the N terminus for binding would result in more rapid dissociation of the N-terminal peptide relative to intact protein. Similarly, rapid dissociation would be expected for the N-terminal peptide if the C terminus induced a conformational change in actin that facilitates binding of the N terminus. In contrast, if a conformational change in the N terminus was the rate-limiting event in binding, and if the presence of the C terminus resulted in more rapid interconversion between the various conformers of thymosin β4, then the effective dissociation rate would be slow in the absence of C terminus. Detached thymosin β4 would be much more likely to re-bind than unfold in the absence of the C terminus. This mechanism is consistent with the known predominance of unfolded peptide in solution, and evidence of a short N-terminal α-helix in the bound state, and is also consistent with the previously reported finding that the interaction of actin with thymosin β4 is not diffusion limited (13De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Brundage R.A. Reddy K.S. Sweeney H.L. Safer D. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2516-2527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The C terminus may effect catalysis of conformational switching in solution or when bound to actin, but given the random coil structure of the C terminus in solution, cooperative effects on conformation are perhaps more likely to be transmitted in the bound state.We note that an alternative interpretation of the data is that the N-terminal thymosin β4 peptide does not bind and release slowly from actin, but rather exerts its effect on nucleotide exchange slowly after rapidly binding. This would necessarily involve both conformational change and allosteric effects in actin. While these conformational changes and allosteric effects very likely exist (13De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Brundage R.A. Reddy K.S. Sweeney H.L. Safer D. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2516-2527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar,26Yarmola E.G. Somasundaram T. Boring T.A. Spector I. Bubb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28120-28127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), there is no precedent nor simple explanation that can elucidate how rapid detachment of the peptide would result in a slower conformational change in actin than does similarly rapid detachment of the intact protein. Still another interpretation of the data is that it is the missing 5 residues from the N terminus of thymosin β4 rather then the missing 21 C-terminal residues that causes the thymosin β4 peptide 6–23 to bind with different kinetics than intact thymosin β4. However, Vancompernolle et al. (9Vancompernolle K. Goethals M. Huet C. Louvard D. Vandekerckhove J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4739-4746Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) present evidence that these N-terminal residues have no effect on binding of thymosin β4 to actin (although these residues do contribute to a steric effect that contributes to the inhibition of actin polymerization), whereas others have presented considerable evidence that the C terminus does influence actin binding activity (14Huff T. Muller C.S. Hannappel E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 15Eadie J.S. Kim S.W. Allen P.G. Hutchinson L.M. Kantor J.D. Zetter B.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 77: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus the presumption that C-terminal residues, rather than the N-terminal residues, are affecting the kinetics of binding is reasonable. The amount of unpolymerized actin in many cells is large. Several actin-monomer sequestering proteins have been identified that are responsible for maintaining this pool, and attempts have been made to account for the quantity of unpolymerized actin by calculation of the sum of sequestered actin in cells (1Southwick F.S. Young C.L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1965-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 2Cassimeris L. Safer D. Nachmias V.T. Zigmond S.H. J.

Struct. 2000; 29: 545-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). These calculations depend not only on the concentration of each sequestering protein and its equilibrium dissociation constant for actin, but also on several other parameters, including an estimate of the critical concentration of actin (i.e. the amount of unpolymerized, unsequestered actin), the stoichiometry with which the sequestering proteins bind to actin, the potential qualitative and quantitative effects should different sequestering proteins interact simultaneously with a single actin subunit, and on assumptions regarding the effects of cytoplasmic molecular crowding on equilibrium association constants. Not surprisingly, with so many parameters to evaluate, even small quantitative errors in measurement or qualitative errors in mechanism result in a wide range of plausible estimates of total sequestered actin. In this report we investigate assumptions that have very significant effects on predictions related to the amount of sequestered actin, finding significant discrepancies with previously reported results, and discuss the expected consequences of these observations. Based on assays measuring steady-state F-actin levels and the failure to obtain a covalently cross-linked ternary complex, thymosin β4 and profilin have been reported to bind competitively to actin (4Giehl K.

The assumption of competitive binding between thymosin β4 and profilin is significant because it underlies models of actin polymerization that show profilin and thymosin β4 sequentially interacting with actin (10Chen H. Bernstein B.W. Bamburg J.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 19-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Also, this assumption has been used as the basis for the analysis of data concerning putative functions of profilin other than monomer sequestration (5Ballweber E. Giehl K. Hannappel E. Huff T.

Chem. 1999; 274: 36963-36972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, the recent evidence that the surface of interaction between thymosin β4 and actin is extensive, involving both subdomains 1 and 2 of actin (12Safer D. Sosnick T.R. Elzinga M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5806-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar,13De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Brundage R.A. Reddy K.S. Sweeney H.L. Safer D. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2516-2527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), implies that there is no structural basis for competitive binding between these actin-binding proteins, and has lead us to re-investigate the hypothesis that profilin and thymosin β4 could form a ternary complex with actin. Additional support for this hypothesis is provided by data showing that some variations in the C terminus of thymosin β4 alter actin affinity and explain, in part, the differences in actin binding activity of β-thymosin isoforms (14Huff T. Muller C.S. Hannappel E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar,15Eadie J.S. Kim S.W. Allen P.G. Hutchinson L.M. Kantor J.D. Zetter B.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 77: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Such data imply that while binding of the N terminus of thymosin β4 to actin may present a steric hindrance to profilin-actin interactions, additional interactions between the C terminus of thymosin β4 and actin could be independent or even augmented by profilin-actin interaction. While thymosin β4 is mostly or completely random coil in aqueous solution, much evidence suggests that the N terminus (residues 5–16) binds to actin in an α-helical conformation (16Czisch M. Schleicher M. Horger S. Voelter W. Holak T.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 17Zarbock J. Oschkinat H. Hannappel E. Kalbacher H. Voelter W. Holak T.A.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 3530-3538Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Trifluoroethanol stabilizes the α-helical conformation and enhances actin binding affinity in a manner consistent with the postulated change in entropy (18Feinberg J. Heitz F. Benyamin Y. Roustan C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). De La Cruz et al. (13De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Brundage R.A. Reddy K.S. Sweeney H.L. Safer D. Biophys.

The molecular interactions of unfolded proteins, such as thymosin β4, with ligand have been proposed by Wright and Dyson (20Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (2298) Google Scholar) to provide regulatory control over critical cellular functions, and indeed, in addition to its actin-binding properties, thymosin β4 exhibits complex biological activities related to immunosuppression and hematopoesis (21Huang W.Q. Wang Q.R. Exp. Hematol. 2001; 29: 12-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 22Young J.D. Lawrence A.J. MacLean A.G. Leung B.P. McInnes I.B. Canas B. Pappin D.J.

Hematol. 1996; 24: 776-782PubMed Google Scholar). Presumably these diverse signaling pathways require multiple binding partners, a situation made possible by the potential of thymosin β4 to adopt induced structural motifs selective and specific for diverse ligands. In the current report, we describe observations regarding the rate and mechanism by which thymosin β4 may effect these conformational transitions. DISCUSSIONPrevious methods used to detect the presence of a ternary complex between profilin, thymosin β4, and actin were unsuccessful. Methods employing steady-state measurements of F-actin concentrations were not sensitive to differences between competitive and noncompetitive binding. Covalent cross-linking also failed to detect the ternary complex, but several explanations are possible. The site of covalent cross-linking on actin could have been identical for both profilin and thymosin β4, so that both could not cross-link simultaneously even if both were bound, or more subtly, profilin may alter the interface of the interaction of thymosin β4 and actin so that thymosin β4 no longer cross-links to actin. Our data which imply competition between the profilin and the N-terminal thymosin β4 peptide (Fig.6 B) suggests that the latter explanation is reasonable. Alternatively, one of the many demonstrable allosteric effects of profilin (26Yarmola E.G. Somasundaram T. Boring T.A. Spector I. Bubb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28120-28127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) may be to alter actin conformation so as to decrease the efficiency with which thymosin β4 cross-links to actin.The concentrations of thymosin β4 and profilin varies in different cells, with as much as 560 μm thymosin β4 and 55 μm profilin in platelets (38Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Machesky L.M. Doberstein S.K. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1081-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar,43Nachmias V.T. Cassimeris L. Golla R. Safer D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 61: 314-320PubMed Google Scholar), and perhaps more typically, embryonic chick brain has 50–60 μm thymosin β4 and 5–6 μmprofilin (44Devineni N. Minamide L.S. Niu M. Safer D. Verma R. Bamburg J.R. Nachmias V.T. Brain Res. 1999; 823: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These concentrations are sufficiently high that given a value of K d PT of 2 to 8 μm, it is likely that significant amounts of the sequestered actin, indeed, most of it in some cells, is present as ternary complex. The functional significance of this finding remains to be elucidated. We have estimated the nucleotide exchange rate of the ternary complex as similar to that of actin alone, but we have no information regarding its effect on nucleation, capping, and filament elongation.These results provide a possible resolution to the paradox as to how significant amounts of actin can be sequestered assuming that molecular crowding lowers the critical concentration of actin in vivo. That is, if the intracellular critical concentration of actin is as low as predicted by experimental data reflecting the molecularly crowded environment of the cytoplasm, then profilin or thymosin β4 acting alone or together would be able to sequester only small amounts of actin. However, if binding is noncompetitive, then because of the disparity between c and the equilibrium dissociation constants for profilin and thymosin β4, these proteins will act synergistically to form ternary complex. This is illustrated in Fig. 7 in an example relevant to human polymorphonuclear cells in which the concentrations of profilin and thymosin β4 are ∼40 and 150 μm, respectively (2Cassimeris L. Safer D. Nachmias V.T. Zigmond S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1261-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This observation provides other potential mechanisms for regulating actin sequestration. Whereas competitive binding results in a shallow linear increase in sequestered actin with increasing profilin, noncompetitive binding results in a steep dependence on profilin concentration that cells could readily regulate, for example, by regulation of production or turnover of polyphosphoinositides, another ligand of profilin.We observe that the equilibrium dissociation constant for profilin-actin reported here is lower than often reported in the literature. However, the range of reported results for mammalian profilin is quite large. Gutsche-Perelroizen (30Perelroizen I. Marchand J.B. Blanchoin L. Didry D. Carlier M.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8472-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) obtainedK d P = 0.12 μm by intrinsic fluorescence measurements on polyproline-purified bovine profilin, andK d P = 0.13 to 0.15 μm from metal nucleotide exchange experiments (45Perelroizen I. Carlier M.F. Pantaloni D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1501-1508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Selden et al.(46Selden L.A. Kinosian H.J. Estes J.E. Gershman L.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2769-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) obtained K d P = 0.60 μm from data for nucleotide exchange.There are several possibilities that can explain why the intact thymosin β4 peptide binds more rapidly to actin than does the N-terminal peptide. The C terminus could augment the rate of conversion from unfolded to a folded, binding competent, intermediate in solution, or could orient the peptide so as to catalyze a zipper effect where the N terminus binds quickly after the C terminus is bound, or could catalyze a conformational change in actin that facilitates rapid binding. The explanation for the slow dissociation rate constant of N-terminal peptide restricts these possibilities. An orientation effect in which the C terminus lines up the N terminus for binding would result in more rapid dissociation of the N-terminal peptide relative to intact protein. Similarly, rapid dissociation would be expected for the N-terminal peptide if the C terminus induced a conformational change in actin that facilitates binding of the N terminus. In contrast, if a conformational change in the N terminus was the rate-limiting event in binding, and if the presence of the C terminus resulted in more rapid interconversion between the various conformers of thymosin β4, then the effective dissociation rate would be slow in the absence of C terminus. Detached thymosin β4 would be much more likely to re-bind than unfold in the absence of the C terminus. This mechanism is consistent with the known predominance of unfolded peptide in solution, and evidence of a short N-terminal α-helix in the bound state, and is also consistent with the previously reported finding that the interaction of actin with thymosin β4 is not diffusion limited (13De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Brundage R.A. Reddy K.S. Sweeney H.L. Safer D. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2516-2527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The C terminus may effect catalysis of conformational switching in solution or when bound to actin, but given the random coil structure of the C terminus in solution, cooperative effects on conformation are perhaps more likely to be transmitted in the bound state.We note that an alternative interpretation of the data is that the N-terminal thymosin β4 peptide does not bind and release slowly from actin, but rather exerts its effect on nucleotide exchange slowly after rapidly binding. This would necessarily involve both conformational change and allosteric effects in actin. While these conformational changes and allosteric effects very likely exist (13De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Brundage R.A. Reddy K.S. Sweeney H.L. Safer D. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2516-2527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar,26Yarmola E.G. Somasundaram T. Boring T.A. Spector I. Bubb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28120-28127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), there is no precedent nor simple explanation that can elucidate how rapid detachment of the peptide would result in a slower conformational change in actin than does similarly rapid detachment of the intact protein. Still another interpretation of the data is that it is the missing 5 residues from the N terminus of thymosin β4 rather then the missing 21 C-terminal residues that causes the thymosin β4 peptide 6–23 to bind with different kinetics than intact thymosin β4. However, Vancompernolle et al. (9Vancompernolle K. Goethals M. Huet C. Louvard D. Vandekerckhove J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4739-4746Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) present evidence that these N-terminal residues have no effect on binding of thymosin β4 to actin (although these residues do contribute to a steric effect that contributes to the inhibition of actin polymerization), whereas others have presented considerable evidence that the C terminus does influence actin binding activity (14Huff T. Muller C.S. Hannappel E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 15Eadie J.S. Kim S.W. Allen P.G. Hutchinson L.M. Kantor J.D. Zetter B.R. J. Cell.

Concentration-dependent changes were observed after stimulation with the mGluR I agonist (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG). These responses changed from a regular low frequency signal with sharp peaks at 1 μm to a pronounced stage of irregularity at 10 μm. After stimulation with 100 μm the signal was again homogenous in shape and regularity but occurred at a higher frequency. In contrast, the spectral properties after stimulation with the α1-adrenoreceptor agonist phenylephrine, exhibited considerable variation for all investigated concentrations.

Consistent with this, previous studies have shown that activation of glial metabotropic glutamate receptors in concert with β-adrenoreceptors (β-AdRs) can result in depression of synaptic activity in which the release of cAMP from astrocytes is central (14Winder D.G. Ritch P.S. Gereau R.W. Conn P.J. J. Physiol. 1996; 494: 743-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Furthermore, adrenergic and glutamatergic interactions can also greatly affect both cAMP- and calcium-related signaling in astroglial cells (15Balazs R. Miller S. Chun Y. O'Toole J. Cotman C.W. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2446-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Both α1-AdRs (3Muyderman H. Hansson E. Nilsson M. Neurosci.

The nature of astrocytic mGluRs is still somewhat unclear. Studies of the distribution of mGluRs in various brain regions have detected only mGluR3 and mGluR5immunoreactivity and, in Northern blot studies, only mRNA for the mGluR3 and mGluR5 have been found (20Condorelli D.F.

Res. 1999; 58: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Calcium transients after mGluR activation have been detected in most astroglial preparations and the oscillatory behavior in mGluR I-induced calcium changes is mediated through the activation of mGluR5 (2Verkhratsky A. Orkand R.K. Kettenmann H. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 99-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 22Kawabata S. Tsutsumi R. Kohara A. Yamaguchi T. Nakanishi S. Okada M.

Their activation elicits oscillatory changes in [Ca2+] i that are distinct from the simple non-oscillatory transients evoked by other subtypes of glutamate and adrenergic receptors. Oscillations in [Ca2+] i are important components in the regulation of several diverse intracellular functions in different cell types, including astrocytes (24Dolmetsch R.E. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Healy J.I. Nature. 1997; 386: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar, 25Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 268: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar, 26Mason W.T.

It has been suggested that the repetitive fluctuations in [Ca2+] i constitute frequency-encoded signals (27Jacob R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1052: 427-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) that transform the original stimuli into defined biological messages. These can in turn initiate multiple cellular processes such as the differentiation of gene transcription (28Dolmetsch R.E. Xu K. Lewis R.S. Nature. 1998; 392: 933-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (1671) Google Scholar) and the secreting of insulin in pancreatic beta cells (29Longo E.A. Tornheim K. Deeney J.T. Varnum B.A. Tillotson D. Prentki M. Corkey B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9314-9319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The multifaceted pattern of receptor-mediated [Ca2+] i changes might also be utilized in the bi-directional interplay between astrocytes and neurons. For example, the characteristics of calcium oscillations are probably crucial for events such as the recently described astroglial glutamate release (30Pasti L. Zonta Z. Pozzan T. Vinici S. Carmignoto G. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 477-484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments performed, both in cell cultures (31Hassinger T.D. Atkinson P.B. Strecker G.J. Whalen L.R. Dudek F.E. Kossel A.H. Kater S.B. J. Neurobiol. 1995; 28: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 32Parpura V. Basarsky T.A. Liu F. Jeftinija K. Jeftinija S. Haydon P.G. Nature. 1994; 369: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar) and acute brain slices (5Pasti L. Volterra A. Pozzan T. Carmignoto G. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7817-7830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), have demonstrated that glutamate is released from astrocytes through a pulsative calcium-dependent process resembling the synaptic release of neurotransmitters. In addition, the mechanisms behind this release do not involve swelling (33Kimelberg H.K. Goderie S.K. Higman S. Pang S. Waniewski R.A. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 1583-1591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or the reversal of transporters (34Szatkowski M. Barbour B. Attwell D. Nature. 1990; 348: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Together, these studies indicate a close connection between [Ca2+] i oscillations and glutamate release in astrocytes, where the periodic changes in [Ca2+] i represent the signal that controls the frequency of the pulsative release (30Pasti L. Zonta Z. Pozzan T. Vinici S. Carmignoto G. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 477-484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An increasing amount of evidence suggests that astrocytic calcium signaling plays a crucial role in information processing in the brain (35Araque A. Parpura V. Sanzgiri R.P. Haydon P.G. Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 208-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). However, in this context, a more detailed investigation of the nature of the oscillatory responses is required. In the present study, we have used spectral analyses to characterize and compare calcium oscillations from single astroglial cells after mGluR I and α1-adrenoreceptor stimulation. Adrenergic effects on mGluR I-mediated glutamate release were also evaluated. The results demonstrate the diverse nature of the oscillatory responses with respect to the receptor system activated. The activation of group I mGluRs but not adrenoreceptor stimulation, elicits glutamate release from cultured astrocytes. We further show that α1-AdRs and mGluRs I are co-localized on cultured astrocytes and that α1-adrenergic activation inhibits DHPG-elicited [Ca2+] i oscillations and the subsequent glutamate release from astroglial cells. Primary astroglial cell cultures were prepared from P1 or P2 Sprague-Dawley rat pups (Charles River, Uppsala, Sweden) as previously described (4Nilsson M. Hansson E. Rönnbäck L. Dev. Brain Res. 1991; 63: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 36Hansson E. Prog. Neurobiol. 1988; 30: 369-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In brief, the brains were removed and cerebral cortices were dissected and cleaned from meninges. The tissues were then passed through an 80-μm mesh nylon net into Eagle's minimum essential medium supplied with Earl's salts (Life Technologies Inc., Paisley, UK). Additional substances were added to make up the following final composition: double concentrations of amino acids and quadruple concentrations of vitamins (Life Technologies), 2 mm l-glutamine (Life Technologies) 7.5 mm glucose (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO), double concentrations of NaHCO3 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies), and 20% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Harlan Sera-Lab, Loughborough, LE, UK), all at pH 7.3. The medium was changed after 3 days of cultivation, and thereafter three times a week. Cultures were grown to confluence in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C and were used for experiments within 14–16 days. Sprague-Dawley rats (P15 and P30) were transcardially perfused for 10 min (infusion pressure, 200–220 mm Hg at room temperature) through a silicon catheter with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1% phosphate buffer. The brains were removed; sections were taken, dehydrated, and paraffin-embedded. Slices (5 μm) were then prepared using a DTK 1500E Microslicer. Primary cortical astroglial cultures were stained for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) or mGluR5 by incubating the cultures with a rabbit affinity-purified IgG anti-mGluR5 (1:400; Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) or a rabbit affinity IgG anti-GFAP (1:100) (Dako Co., Glostrup, Denmark). Secondary antibodies used were affinity-purified biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG diluted 1:200 (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), followed by an avidin biotin complex (ABC) detection system (Vectastain Elite, Vector Laboratories). Immunoreaction was visualized with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB). Coverslips were mounted on microscope slides using fluorescent mounting medium (Dako Co.) and viewed in a Nikon Optiphot-2. The pictures were captured using a Hamamatsu C5810 color-intensified 3-CCD camera. Slices were deparaffinized and rehydrated, the antigen was demasked by microwaves, and slices were incubated with a rabbit purified IgG anti-mGluR5 and a mouse anti-GFAP clone G-A-5, (1:400 and 1:50, respectively, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, GmbH, Germany) overnight at 4–8 °C. A biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG affinity-purified secondary antibody (1:200, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) conjugated to streptavidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate was used for detection of mGluR5 immunoreactivity (1 h at 18–20 °C). GFAP-positive cells were visualized using Texas red-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG antibodies (1:300, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). Hard copy pictures were captured using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Bio-Rad MRC1024) connected with a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope and a 15-milliwatt Kr/Ar mixed gas laser. Changes in [Ca2+] i were monitored using the calcium-sensitive fluorophore fluo-3 (8 μm for 30–45 min at 37 °C) (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands), supplied with 0.03% pluronic acid according to a previously described procedure (37Muyderman H. Nilsson M. Blomstrand F. Khatibi S. Olsson T. Hansson E. Rönnbäck L. Brain Res. 1998; 793: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Low level light images were captured with a CCD camera (Hamamatsu C-2400 80 or a PTI 200 CCD), and data were analyzed with Matlab 4.0 and a PTI imaging system (Photon Technology International Inc., Monmouth Junction, NJ). Background subtraction was performed, and data were normalized to baseline and expressed as ΔF/F 0, where ΔF is the fluorescence deviation fromF 0. Extracellular media contained 137 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.41 mmMgSO4, 0.49 mm MgCl2, 1.26 mm CaCl2, 0.64 mmKH2PO4, 3 mm NaCO3, 5.5 mm glucose, and 20 mm Hepes (38Nilsson M. Hansson E. Rönnbäck L. Life Sci. 1991; 49: 1339-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). When appropriate, drugs were delivered directly to individual cells with the aid of a pressure-driven pico-injector (Nikon PLI-188). Micropipettes were pulled on a Narishige PP-83 pipette puller from borosilicate capillaries (Clark Electromedical Instruments, Pangbourne, UK). Applications were preformed using a Narishige 1M3 micromanipulator connected to the injector. Frequency analyses of each oscillatory fluorescence signal were performed using fast Fourier transformation (FFT). Signals were collected at 1–10 frames/s for 1000 s and low-pass-filtered at 0.3 Hz. The analysis was made according to normal signal processing standards described in digital signal processing textbooks (e.g. Ref. 39Manolakis D.G. Proakis J.G. Digital Signal Processing: Principles, Algorithms, and Applications. 3rd Ed. Prentice-Hall, Inc., New Jersey1996Google Scholar). In brief, because the oscillating sequences varied in length, the sequences were padded with zero samples to get an equal sequence length of an even power of two. The mean value and first order trend was subtracted from the original signal, and the resulting signal was connected front to end to form a cycle of the signal to be transformed. A window, Hamming, which dampens the signal amplitudes at the beginning and the end, was also applied to the sequence to eliminate a signal jump at the connection point. The information of this cyclic sequence and its Fourier transform are equivalent. Mean averages of the power spectra were compared with regard to frequency range and amplitude. The spectra were used to determine characteristics of the oscillations as well as the shape of the individual deflections; a stable frequency during oscillation will generate narrow peaks, and sharp deflections will generate many harmonics. Properties of each individual peak in the power spectra were expressed as the ratio of the frequency at the peak amplitude divided by the half power width, k i (the width at 1/√2 of the peak value in the signal spectrum), where i indicates the peak number. Logarithmic values of the k i,i = 1 to 3, are plotted to illustrate these properties; high absolute values will indicate stable frequency during the oscillation, whereas a steep slope will indicate rounded and/or variable waveforms. Glutamate release was measured using glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) oxidization of glutamate to α-ketoglutarate. In this reaction β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is reduced to NADH. Because the NADH produced in the reaction is fluorescent when excited by UV light, the reaction can be followed as changes in NADH fluorescence and as an indirect indicator of the glutamate released (40Nicholls D.G. Sihra T.S. Sanchez-Prieto J. J. Neurochem. 1987; 49: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 41Innocenti B. Parpura V. Haydon P.G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1800-1808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The experiments were performed at room temperature (20–22 °C), using an upright Nikon Eclipse E600-FN microscope equipped with a PTI imaging system. Light from a xenon lamp was filtered at 335 nm, and emissions were collected at 470 nm. Background subtraction was performed, and data was normalized to baseline and expressed as ΔF/F 0, where ΔF is the fluorescence deviation from F 0.K m (651.3 μm) for the reaction was determined using known concentrations of glutamate added to a solution of GDH and NAD+ and where C/v was plotted against C using a Hanes plot. Standard buffer was used with addition of GDH (50 units/ml) and NAD+ (1 mm). All experiments were ended with the application of glutamate (100 μm) to verify the method. The concentration of extracellular amino acids was determined using reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) employing automated precolumn fluorogenic labeling withO-phthalaldehyde/β-mercaptoethanol (42Wallin C. Weber S.G. Sandberg M. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1566-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The column (300 × 4.6 mm) was packed with Nucleosil 100–5C18 (Macherey-Nagel, Germany). Derivates were eluted with a gradient from 0 to 90% methanol (containing 1.25% tetrahydrofuran (v/v)) in a sodium phosphate buffer, 50 mm, set at pH 5.40 with 1 m NaOH and containing 2.5% tetrahydrofuran. The autoinjector (Water Wisp 717 plus) was programmed to add 25 μl of OPA/β-mercaptoethanol to 50 μl of incubation medium. Controls were collected at 30, 20, and 10 min prior to application of 10–100 μm noradrenaline, and samples for determining the efflux of amino acids were taken <1, 3, 10, and 20 min after the stimulation. Results are presented as relative increases or decreases compared with control value. The level of significance between groups was calculated using variance analysis (ANOVA) followed by post hoc range tests and pairwise multiple comparisons (Bonferroni), or Student's double-tailed t test. Glutamate, DHPG, S-4-carboxyphenyl glycine, kainic acid, and AMPA were obtained from Tocris-Cookson (St. Louis, MO). Pluronic acid was supplied by Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). All other chemicals of analytical grade were manufactured by Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). In the astroglial cultures, the majority of the cells were GFAP-positive (Fig. 1 A) and shown to express immunoreactivity for the mGluR5 marker (Fig. 1 B). Fig. 1 C illustrates the expression of mGluR5 on GFAP-positive cells in the cortical brain slice. GFAP-positive cells appear red; the mGluR5 isgreen. The presence of the α1-adrenoreceptor is previously well defined on astrocytes in cultures as well as in different in situ preparations (43Duffy S. MacVicar B.A. J.

Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 238: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 4Nilsson M. Hansson E. Rönnbäck L. Dev. Brain Res. 1991; 63: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The kinetics of [Ca2+] i changes were characterized after both continuous as well as transient exposure to glutamate and the mGluR group I agonist (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG). The agonists elicited calcium transients with different spatial-temporal patterns and varying frequencies in the majority of the cells (40 trials; >500 cells) (Fig.2, A and B). No or sparse oscillatory behavior were seen after the ionotropic receptor agonists α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-proprionic acid (AMPA) or kainic acid. The individual calcium responses were characterized, and the response patterns were classified into three separate groups (Fig.3, A–C). The first group displayed monophasic responses consisting of one single peak during 300 s of observation time. The second group was characterized by biphasic responses displaying two distinct separated peaks, and the third group demonstrated oscillatory responses exhibiting three or more transients during the initial 300 s. In astrocytes displaying oscillations, a second or third stimulation repeatedly elicited responses with similar frequency and duration (Fig.4). As a common criterion, an increase in ΔF of 20% or above was regarded as a response. Spontaneous calcium transients or oscillations were seen in less than 5% of the cell population. Oscillatory changes in [Ca2+] i were seen in 16.7 ± 8.3 and 32.6 ± 6.0% (mean ± S.D.) of the responding cells after 10 μm glutamate and DHPG, respectively. No oscillatory responses were seen after low concentrations of glutamate (≤1 μm), whereas 15.1% of the cells responding to 1 μm DHPG exhibited periodic changes in [Ca2+] i . Glutamate or DHPG concentrations exceeding 50 μm did not increase the proportion of oscillatory responses (Fig. 2 B).Figure 4Repeated DHPG or PE stimulation elicits responses with similar frequency and duration. Traces from two different astrocytes that are repeatedly stimulated with 10 μm DHPG. The first cell (A) responds with an oscillatory behavior, whereas the second (B) displays the monophasic response. The cells were rinsed and put to rest for 10–15 min between the each stimulation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Uncoupling of gap junctions demonstrated the independence of intracellular communication for single cell responses. Responses and oscillation rates were non-significantly altered by exposure to the gap junctional uncoupler 18-α-glycyrrhetinic acid, 10 μm for 10 min (n = 10 trials; 200 cells). The sensitivity for changes in protein kinase C (PKC) activity were evaluated after DHPG stimulation. Data showed that the PKC activator phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA, 150 nm) reduced the oscillatory responses to a single peak response or, in less then 10%, no response at all (Fig.5 A). This indicates a rapid PKC-mediated negative feedback. Exposure to the PKC inhibitor Ro 31-8220 (10 μm, 5 or 10 min) totally inhibited the DHPG-induced oscillations (Fig. 5 B), further verifying the dependence of a well-regulated PKC activity for the initiation and maintenance of mGluR-coupled [Ca2+] i oscillations (n = 20 trials; 400 cells). Individual oscillating signals (40 cells/agonist and concentration) were randomly chosen from a total number of DHPG-induced responses exceeding 500 cells/agonist/concentration. Both individual cells as well as groups of different cells were sequentially stimulated with the appropriate agonist, and average power spectra obtained from the FFT analyses of single cell oscillations were compared and analyzed. No significant differences between these approaches were detected. After exposure to 1 μm DHPG, the spectra demonstrated a range of oscillatory frequencies between 5 and 21 mHz, with >90% occurring at 6.8–14.0 mHz and an average at 10.1 ± 5.7 mHz (mean ± S.D.). Mean frequencies after 10 and 100 μmDHPG were 15.9 ± 12.5 and 22.0 ± 5.9 mHz, respectively (Fig. 6 A). At increasing concentrations, the frequency domain exhibited a rightward shift, revealing a pronounced concentration dependence. As described in Fig.6 B, the regularity and shape of the original calcium transients displayed significant differences (ANOVA, p< 0.001) after exposure for 1 and 10 μm but not after 1 and 100 μm DHPG. The application of 1 μmDHPG induced slow oscillations with sharp peaks and low frequencies in 15.1% of the responding cells. In contrast, 10 μmdisplaced a higher average frequency, 15.88 ± 12.51 mHz, and a more pronounced irregularity in both rhythm and shape. After the exposure to 100 μm DHPG, the regularity of the oscillations was regained and the shape of the individual peaks was sharpened, although at a higher frequency (21.98 ± 5.93 mHz). Interestingly, no significant differences in the duration of the oscillations were seen between the different concentrations. Taken together, the above results directly demonstrate that the oscillatory nature of calcium transients after mGluR I activation can be controlled between, at least, two distinct different signaling states. The results obtained from the DHPG-stimulated cells were compared with the kinetics of the [Ca2+] i changes and spectra obtained after adrenergic stimulation. Noradrenaline and phenylephrine (PE, α1-AdrR) were shown to elicit similar patterns of [Ca2+] i changes (Fig.7, A and B) as DHPG. Either none or sparse oscillations were seen after α2- or β-adrenoreceptor activation (n = 10 trials; 200 cells). The sensitivity for changes in PKC activity was confirmed for α1-AdrR. Both the activation of PKC (PMA; 150 nm, 15 min) and the inhibition (Ro 31-8220; 10 μm, 5 or 10 min) abolished the oscillatory nature of the PE-induced calcium responses. The inhibition of PKC also significant lowered the response rate (n = 15 trials; 300 cells), whereas the incubation with PMA totally inhibited PE-induced calcium respons"

Due to a high similarity between PrP of different mammals, their sequences are usually represented as aligned with the human one (9Schatzl H.M. Da Costa M. Taylor L. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. J. Mol.

This globular PrP domain, which behaves as an independent folding unit (16Hornemann S. Glockshuber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 614-619Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar), is composed of two short antiparallel β-strands (S1 and S2) and three α-helices (H1–H3) (17Riek R. Hornemann S. Wider G. Billeter M. Glockshuber R. Wüthrich K. Nature. 1996; 382: 180-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar). Helices H2 and H3 are stabilized by a disulfide bond and form the C-terminal scaffold, which probably has the same conformation in PrPSc and PrPC (18Muramoto T. Scott M. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B.

Most of them belong to the 90–145 region generally believed to be essential for prion propagation. It was shown that this region as a whole, as well as some of its parts, have intrinsic propensity to produce insoluble intermolecular aggregates of extended β-like structure, which might be involved in promoting the PrPC → PrPScconformational transition. Because helix H1 and the two adjacent surface loops, L2 and L3, were earlier suggested to adopt an extended β-like structure upon interactions with the pre-existing PrPC β-sheet during the events leading to prion pathogenic conversion (17Riek R. Hornemann S. Wider G. Billeter M. Glockshuber R. Wüthrich K. Nature. 1996; 382: 180-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar), we decided to analyze in more details this region of the protein. Sharman et al. (33Sharman G.J. Kenward N. Williams H.E. Landon M. Mayer R.J. Searle M.S. Fold. Des. 1998; 3: 313-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) already studied three linear synthetic peptides spanning the β-sheet and helix H1 region of PrPC (residues 125–170). Unfortunately, their structural analysis could not be carried out in physiologically relevant conditions because of precipitation of the peptides under neutral pH. Here we have examined by CD and NMR spectroscopic analyses the solution structure of a linear 26-mer peptide (hereafter referred to as peptide “n3”), which had not been investigated before. It contains 25 residues corresponding to the domain 145–169 of sheep prion protein (34Goldmann W. Hunter N. Foster J.D. Salbaum J.M. Beyreuther K. Hope J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2476-2480Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) (142–166 in human prion protein numbering) and a C-terminal cysteine. Its sequence is1GNDYEDRYYRENMYRYPNQVYYRPVC26, where the underlined letters represent the segments corresponding to helix H1 (144) and β–strand S2 (161), respectively, in the PrPC structure. The experimental results obtained in the present work show that this peptide (i) remains soluble in aqueous medium and does not aggregate even in the millimolar concentration range and (ii) exhibits an intrinsic propensity to a β-hairpin-like conformation at neutral pH, which contrasts the prion-derived peptides studied earlier. This β-propensity can be one of the internal driving forces of the molecular rearrangement responsible for the pathogenic conversion of the prion protein. The n3 peptide was synthesized on solid phase on Applied Biosystems 431A peptide synthesizer. The synthesis was carried out using HMP-resin (4-hydroxymethyl phenoxymethyl-copoly(styrene-1% divinylbenzene)) and Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) and 2-(H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluoro-phosphate/N-hydroxybenzotriazole as coupling mediators. After synthesis, peptide products were deprotected and cleaved from the support by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid. The peptide was purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (Waters) on a semi-preparative column C4 eluted with linear gradient of water/acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid (10–100%). Peptide fractions were pooled and lyophilized. To check the peptide purity, amino acid analysis and mass spectrometry were performed, and the results corresponded well to the expected sequences. The purity exceeded 99%. The mouse prion peptide of 99% grade purity was purchased from Eurogentec (Herstal, Belgium). CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-710 instrument. Samples were studied in quartz cells with path lengths 0.5 or 1 mm. Peptide concentrations were determined by ultraviolet absorbance (35Gill S.C. Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5048) Google Scholar). CD signals were expressed as the mean residue weight ellipticity values, [Θ], in deg cm2 dmol−1. Samples were scanned over the wavelength range 190–260 nm by recording values every 0.1 nm with 100 nm min−1 scan rate, with an integration time of 0.5 s and a 2-nm bandwidth. Each spectrum was the average of 8 or 16 scans. FDCD spectra were measured at room temperature in a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter with the fluorescence detector on-line with the incident light to avoid artificial linear dichroic signal. The exciting circularly polarized light was cut off by saturated NaNO3 solution in 2.5-cm path length cuvette as described by Muto et al. (36Muto K. Mochizuki H. Yoshida R. Ishii T. Handa T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 6416-6417Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). NMR samples were dissolved in H2O/D2O (9:1, v/v) or D2O with 10 mm sodium phosphate-buffered, pH 6.5, solution. A crystal of TSPD4(3-(trimethylsilyl)[2,2,3,3-d4] propionic acid), sodium salt, was used as an internal reference for the proton shifts. The experiments were run at 500.13 MHz for 1H on Bruker AMX 500 spectrometer equipped with a Silicon Graphics workstation. The WATERGATE method (37Piotto, M., Saudek, V., and Sklenar, V. (1992) J. Biomol. NMR0 2, 661–665Google Scholar) was used to eliminate solvent signal in H2O/D2O (9:1) solution instead of the presaturation method in D2O solution. One- and two-dimensional TOCSY, two-dimensional ROESY, and two-dimensional NOESY spectra were recorded at several temperatures within the 5–37 °C range. Mixing times of 35–80 ms were used for two-dimensional TOCSY. For two-dimensional ROESY experiments, a spin-lock of 200–400 ms was used. Two-dimensional phase NOESY experiments in the 50- to 800-ms range were carried out using the States-time-proportional phase incrementation method. The3 J HNα scalar coupling constants were extracted from two-dimensional TOCSY spectra. The 13C NMR chemical shifts were carefully calibrated using 4,4-dimethyl 4-silapentane sodium sulfonate and TSPD4. The assignments of 13C were made using 1H-13C chemical shift correlation (pulse field gradient-heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation (38Hurd R.E. John B.K. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 91: 648-653Google Scholar), and pulse field gradient-heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (39Bax A. Summers M.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 2093-2095Crossref Scopus (3270) Google Scholar)) spectra. Conformational calculations were performed in the torsion angle space with the standard geometry of amino acids and planar peptide groups. The distance restraints obtained from the NOESY experiments were first classified as strong, medium, weak, and very weak, with the upper distances assigned at 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, and 5.5 Å, respectively. The lower distance restraints were unnecessary, because the full atom AMBER94 (40Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Gould I.R. Merz K.M. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.C. Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5179-5197Crossref Scopus (11553) Google Scholar) force field was used throughout. When restraints were applied to pseudoatoms, the distances were increased as usual (41Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). The calculations involved multiple cycles of simulated annealing starting from arbitrary extended conformations, with pseudoatom restraints and the variable target function approach (42Braun W. Go N. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 186: 611-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). At the final stage pseudoatoms were replaced by appropriate protons, and all restraints were set at a single upper limit of 5.0 Å. The general purpose internal coordinate molecular dynamics software (43Mazur A.K. J. Comput. Chem. 1997; 18: 1354-1364Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 44Mazur A.K. Becker O.M. MacKerell A.D. Roux B. Watanabe M. Computational Biochemistry and Biophysics. Marcel Dekker, New York2001: 115-131Google Scholar) was used with the AMBER94 atom parameters. The polar solvent environment was modeled implicitly by reducing the charge of ionized side chains by one-half and applying the distance-dependent dielectric permitivity D(r) = r. The final refined conformation was additionally verified by a 100-ps molecular dynamics (MD) simulation run with INSIGHT standard software (45Dauber-Osguthorpe P. Roberts V.A. Osguthorpe D.J. Wolff J. Genest M. Hagler A.T. Proteins. 1988; 4: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar). Visualization and analysis of the calculated conformers were performed with MOLMOL (46Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6487) Google Scholar) and PROCHECK-NMR (47Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4404) Google Scholar). Upper bound NOE constraints, used in the final round of structure calculation, atomic coordinates for a bundle of 20 MD refined conformers and for the best conformer of the n3 peptide have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (available at www.rcsb.org, PDB code 1G04). The proton chemical shifts table and the 3 J HNα scalar coupling constants of the n3 peptide have been deposited with the BioMagResBank (www.bmrb.wisc.edu, code BMRB-4010). The overall secondary structure of the n3 peptide was analyzed in different experimental conditions by far-UV CD spectroscopy (Fig. 2). When studied in PB buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5) at 25 °C, the peptide produced a broad negative Cotton effect at 208 nm with a shoulder at 216 nm, and two smaller signals, namely, a positive one at 233 nm and a negative one at 241 nm (Fig.2). Because the n3 peptide contains 7 tyrosine residues, for proper interpretation of the CD signal it is important to differentiate the contributions from the backbone and from the aromatic side chains, respectively. Fluorescence-detected circular dichroism (FDCD) spectroscopy was used to probe selectively the CD contribution of the tyrosine residues (48Lobenstine E.W. Schaefer W.C. Turner D.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1981; 103: 4936-4940Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The separated signal was very small, thus, it was concluded that the total CD signal of the n3 peptide reflected mostly the secondary structure of the backbone. The observed spectrum indicates, therefore, the presence of some secondary structure different from random coil conformation (49Venyaminov S.Y. Yang J.T. Fasman G.D. Circular Dichroism and the Conformational Analysis of Biomolecules. Plenum Press, New York & London1996: 69-104Crossref Google Scholar). Low acidic pH (less than 2) resulted in typical random coil CD signal (characterized by a prominent negative band around 198 nm) of the n3 peptide in aqueous solution (data not shown) suggesting complete destabilization of the structure observed at pH 6.5. However, the solubility of the peptide remained unaffected by acidic pH. The effects of other environmental factors, notably, 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol, upon the conformation of the n3 peptide were studied by CD and NMR spectroscopic analyses and described elsewhere (50Bertho, G., Kozin, S. A., Debey, P., Hui Bon Hoa, G., and Girault, J.-P. (2001) Comp. Rend. Acad. Sci., in pressGoogle Scholar). To check whether any aggregation of the n3 peptide takes place in PB buffer, the concentration dependence of the normalized CD signals of the peptide samples was studied at two different wavelengths (217 and 225 nm). The mean residue weight ellipticities, [Θ], did not vary in the 5–1000 μm range (Fig. 2, inset). Also, no significant changes in chemical shifts or line widths were observed in one-dimensional NMR spectra in the 480–4800 μmconcentration range (data not shown). These two tests, which are sensitive to aggregation (51Waltho J.P. Feher V.A. Merutka G. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6337-6347Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 52Ramirez-Alvarado M. Blanco F.J. Serrano L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 604-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), indicate that the peptide does not aggregate in these conditions. It is worth noting that, when stored at room temperature, the peptide samples maintained their CD and NMR spectra unchanged over a 4-month period, demonstrating also the absence of any time-dependent aggregation. The conformational properties of the 26-mer peptide1GNDWEDRYYRENMYRYPNQVYYRPVD26, corresponding to the mouse prion protein region 142–167, were also studied. The mouse peptide differs from the n3 peptide by 2 residues (Trp4 and Asp26 instead of Tyr4 and Cys26, respectively) and shows the same CD spectra as the n3 peptide in PB buffer in the same range of concentrations (data not shown). Thus, the n3 peptide can be considered as a realistic model for the study of the conformational properties of the 142–166 segment of both sheep and mouse prion proteins. The absence of time-dependent aggregation of the n3 peptide at millimolar concentrations at neutral pH allowed us to study conformational features of the peptide by NMR spectroscopy. To obtain the spatial structure of the n3 peptide, the 1H NMR experiments were carried out at 500.13 MHz with 4.5 mm non-labeled peptide in PB buffer solution. Two-dimensional TOCSY spectra were recorded with 35- to 80-ms mixing times, and the assignment of spin systems thus determined (Fig. 3) was confirmed by NOESY and ROESY experiments. When all spin systems were identified, the sequential assignment of the peptide amino acid residues (TableI) was carried out by using the strategy developed by Wüthrich (41Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). To resolve the assignment ambiguities resulting from signal overlaps, all experiments were performed at three different temperatures, namely, 5 °C, 20 °C, and 37 °C, exploiting the temperature-induced shift of the amide resonances.Table IProton chemical shift assignments (δ in ppm from sodium 3-trimethylsilyl (2,2,3,3-D 4) propionate, 5 °C, pH 6.5), amide signal shift temperature coefficients (Δ (δ NH)/ΔT, in p.p.b.

Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1908) Google Scholar). In the case of the n3 peptide, no residues in regular secondary structures was found by applying the1Hα CSI method (data not shown), whereas the other CSI techniques revealed that residues 20–23 appeared to show β-strand propensity (Fig. 4). Additionally, a hairpin structure was reflected in the3 J HNα scalar coupling constants (Table I). Among 19 values measured, the 15 ones from residues 2–7, 10, 12, 13, 15, 18–20, 25, and 26 are larger than their random coil values (54Serrano L. J. Mol.

The amide signal shift temperature coefficients (Δ(δNH)/ΔT, in ppb K−1) were derived for all backbone amide protons of the n3 peptide (Table I). For the residues involved in intramolecular hydrogen-bonding network and/or hidden in a structural core-protected from solvent, one can expect low absolute values of this coefficient as compared with the range of values measured for random-coil peptides (56Blanco F.J. Rivas G. Serrano L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 584-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Indeed, residues 6, 12, 13, 15, and 19 give values between −5 and −3.4 ppb K−1and can be considered as at least partially protected from external water molecules. The TOCSY spectral analysis shows the presence of duplicate cross-peaks for the spin systems of the two C-terminal residues: Val25 and Cys26 (Fig. 3). The corresponding ratio of peak intensities was estimated as 2:1. The strong dα-δ sequential NOE connectivity between Arg23 and Pro24 indicates that the major form corresponds to the peptide structure in which the peptide bond between Arg23 and Pro24 is in the transconformation. For the same bond in the minor form, the strong dα-α agrees with the cis conformation. Thistrans:cis equilibrium at Pro24 points to a higher mobility of the C-terminal part of the backbone suggesting that the 24–26 segment is not crucial for the overall peptide structure. NOESY spectra were obtained at a variety of mixing times from 50 to 800 ms. All distance restraints used in the structure refinement were derived from NOEs observed at 5 °C in PB buffer during NOESY experiments at 500-ms mixing time (Fig.5). The sequential NOE pattern observed was typical of extended backbone structure: weak dN-N(i, i+1) and strong dα-N(i, i+1) (Fig. 6). Weaker dα-N (i, i+1) registered for residues 13–15 are indicative of a turn region. A total of 169 unambiguous sequential and long and medium range NOE restraints were used in the n3 peptide structure calculation (TableII). The refinement procedure involved multiple cycles of simulated annealing (see “Experimental Procedures”). At the end of each cycle the structure was quenched by energy minimization, and these conformations were ranked according to the residual weight of NOE restraints. The n3 peptide may have in solution a few conformations with the same backbone fold, but slightly different orientations of side chains, as commonly observed for short linear polypeptides (57Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5 (suppl.): 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The NOE-derived contacts that involve side-chain protons may, therefore, contradict one another, and this presents the main source of experimental error. Fig.7 shows backbone conformations of the five top ranked conformers with the residual NOE scores within 20% variation. This bundle is characterized by the r.m.s.d. of 3.64 Å for all non-hydrogen atoms, which may be considered as an estimate of the experimental error in the best structure shown in"

We focus here on the topoisomerase I from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima (optimal growth temperature, 80 °C). To determine the properties of the enzyme compared with those of its mesophilic homologs, we overexpressedT. maritima topoisomerase I in Escherichia coliand purified it to near homogeneity. We show that T. maritima topoisomerase I exhibits a very high DNA relaxing activity. Mapping of the cleavage sites on a variety of single-stranded oligonucleotides indicates a strong preference for a cytosine at position −4 of the cleavage, a property shared by E. colitopoisomerase I and archaeal reverse gyrases. As expected, the mutation of the putative active site Tyr 288 to Phe led to a totally inactive protein. To investigate the role of the unique zinc motif (Cys-X-Cys-X 16-Cys-X-Cys) present in T. maritima topoisomerase I, experiments have been performed with the protein mutated on the tetracysteine motif. Strikingly, the results show that zinc binding is not required for DNA relaxation activity, contrary to the E. coli enzyme. Furthermore, neither thermostability nor cleavage specificity is altered in this mutant. This finding opens the question of the role of the zinc-binding motif in T. maritima topoisomerase I and suggests that this hyperthermophilic topoisomerase possesses a different mechanism from its mesophilic homolog.

In particular, molecular machineries in charge of genetic information have to function at temperatures near the boiling point of water. Topoisomerases, a class of enzymes specialized in manipulating DNA, are involved in the maintenance and control of DNA supercoiling. In mesophilic bacteria (i.e. Escherichia coli), the DNA supercoiling control is achieved mainly through the balance between negative supercoiling impulsed by gyrases and DNA relaxation by topoisomerase I (1Drlica K. Mol. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 6: 425-433Crossref Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 2Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2054) Google Scholar). In hyperthermophilic organisms, this control appears particularly important for life at high temperatures. Indeed, at such temperatures, the opening of the double helix is favored, and the control of supercoiling is crucial to maintaining the stability of the DNA duplex while ensuring initiation of essential processes such as replication, transcription, and recombination/repair. Little information about the DNA supercoiling control in hyperthermophilic bacteria is available. To get a better view of this process, we used Thermotoga maritima as a model organism. In this bacterium, which grows at 80 °C, we have already described three topoisomerases: a gyrase (3Guipaud O. Marguet E. Noll K.M.,. Bouthier de la Tour C. Forterre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10606-10691Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and a topoisomerase I (4Bouthier de la Tour C. Kaltoum H. Portemer C. Confalonieri F. Huber R. Duguet M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), as found in all other bacteria, but also a reverse gyrase (5Bouthier de la Tour C. Portemer C. Kaltoum H. Duguet M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 274-281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as found in hyperthermophilic archaea (6Bouthier de la Tour C. Portemer C. Nadal M. Stetter K. Forterre P. Duguet M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6803-6808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This third topoisomerase is able to introduce positive supercoils into DNA. Surprisingly, in T. maritima, episomal DNA (3Guipaud O. Marguet E. Noll K.M.,. Bouthier de la Tour C. Forterre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10606-10691Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 7Akimkina T. Ivanov P. Kostrov S. Sokolova T. Bonch-Osmolovskaya E. Firman K. Dutta C.F. McClellan J.A. Plasmid. 1999; 42: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) is negatively supercoiled as inE. coli, contrary to the hyperthermophilic archaea in which episomal DNA is positively supercoiled (8Lopez-Garcia P. Forterre P. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 1267-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, in T. maritima, gyrases and topoisomerase I probably control the global level of DNA supercoiling as in mesophilic bacteria. In the present work, we have focused on the study of the T. maritima topoisomerase I overexpressed in E. coli and used mutational analysis to explore some of its biochemical properties. The protein is composed of 633 amino acids. Sequence analysis (4Bouthier de la Tour C. Kaltoum H. Portemer C. Confalonieri F. Huber R. Duguet M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 9Kaltoum H. Portemer C. Confalonieri F. Duguet M. Bouthier de la Tour C. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1997; 20: 505-512Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar) has shown previously that this protein is clearly related to the topoisomerase IA subfamily, the representative of which is topoisomerase I from E. coli. Similarities are located particularly within the first 540 amino acids of the protein. In this region, all the conserved sequence motifs defined for the other members of the family are found in the T. maritima enzyme, and Tyr288 was proposed to be the active site tyrosine (4Bouthier de la Tour C. Kaltoum H. Portemer C. Confalonieri F. Huber R. Duguet M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Here, we show that T. maritima topoisomerase I relaxes DNA at 75 °C with an unusually high specific activity compared with the enzyme from E. coli and is also able to decatenate nicked kinetoplast DNA networks. Analysis of the DNA cleavage reaction, which constitutes the first step of the topoisomerization cycle, shows a strong preference for cytosine at position −4 of the cleavage point as is the case for E. coli topoisomerase I (10Dean F.B. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4984-4994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and archaeal reverse gyrases (11Kovalsky O.I. Kozyavkin S.A. Slesarev A.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2801-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 12Jaxel C. Duguet M. Nadal M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We have also confirmed that Tyr288 is the active site residue involved in this reaction. Interestingly, although relaxation is highly sensitive to temperature, the cleavage step by T. maritima topoisomerase I is very efficient at 24 °C. Examining the C-terminal part of the protein including the last 93 amino acids, no similarity with the other topoisomerases of the family was found (4Bouthier de la Tour C. Kaltoum H. Portemer C. Confalonieri F. Huber R. Duguet M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), except a putative zinc-binding motif with the structure Cys-X-Cys-X 16-Cys-X-Cys (Fig. 1). This type of tetracysteine motif is present in the C-terminal part of most bacterial topoisomerases I sequences with a variable number of copies of up to four. Interestingly, all of these motifs share a significant similarity (Fig. 1). In E. colitopoisomerase I, it has been shown that zinc binding to the three tetracysteine motifs present in the protein is required for DNA relaxation activity (13Tse-Dinh Y.-C. Beran-Steed R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15857-15859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Tse-Dinh Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14317-14320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we show that, contrary to the case of E. coli, the unique zinc-binding motif of T. maritima topoisomerase I is not required for the topoisomerization reaction. Indeed, the enzyme mutated on the tetracysteine motif loses the ability to bind zinc but retains wild type activities. The function of the zinc motif in T. maritima topoisomerase I remains unknown, but our results support the idea that the mechanism of the hyperthermophilic topoisomerase I may be somewhat different from that of its E. coli mesophilic homolog. A DNA fragment encodingT. maritima topoisomerase I was prepared by polymerase chain reaction using genomic DNA as template, Pfu DNA polymerase (Expand High Fidelity kit, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and the following primers: 5′-AGAGGTGGAGGAGGATCCGAGTAAGAAAGTGAAGAAATATATCGT-3′ as forward primer containing a BamHI restriction site and 5′-TCATACCCGAGTGTCGACTCAAGAGCCTTTTTTACCCTTTCTCCGCTT-3′ as reverse primer containing a SalI restriction site. Polymerase chain reaction products were inserted into the pET29b expression vector (Novagen) at the BamHI/SalI sites, and constructs were checked by DNA sequencing. The resulting expression plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). A colony of transformed cells was picked and grown at 37 °C in LB medium with 30 μg/ml kanamycin untilA 600 reached 0.5–0.6. Induction was carried out with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C (A 600, 1.0–1.2), and the cells were harvested and stocked at −80 °C until required. About 15 g of cells were obtained from 4 liters of culture. The same procedure was followed to express the mutant enzymes. Frozen cells were resuspended in 10 volumes of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1m NaCl), lysed by sonication, and centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The crude extract was then heated for 15 min at 75 °C and immediately centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. To remove DNA, polymin P was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 0.36%. After stirring for 1 h, the solution was centrifuged for 1 h at 90,000 × g. Ammonium sulfate (70% saturation) was added to the supernatant, and the solution was stirred overnight at 4 °C before centrifugation (24,000 ×g for 30 min). The pellet was dissolved in 7 ml of buffer A and dialyzed extensively against this buffer at 4 °C. The solution was clarified by centrifugation at 24,000 × g for 20 min and applied to a heparin-Sepharose column (BioSepra) equilibrated with buffer A. Elution was performed by applying a gradient of 0.1–1 m NaCl in buffer A. Active fractions eluted around 0.5–0.6 m NaCl. They were pooled and concentrated in Amicon concentrator (Centricon 30) before loading onto a gel filtration column (Superdex S200, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.6 mNaCl. Glycerol was added to a final concentration of 15% prior to storage of the active fractions at −20 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Schaffner and Weissmann (15Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1945) Google Scholar), with BSA1 as a standard, or spectrophotometrically using the theoretical molar extinction coefficient of the topoisomerase I (ε278 = 56254m−1 cm−1). A very good correlation was found between these two methods. Site-specific mutagenesis within the T. maritima topoisomerase I gene, replacing Tyr288 (TAT codon) by a Phe (TTT codon), was performed using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the following primers: 5′-GGGCATATCGCGTTCATAACCTTTATGAGAACAGATTCAACGCG-3′ and 5′-CGCGTTGAATCTGTTCTCATAAAGGTTATGAACGCGATATGCCC-3′ (forward and reverse primers, respectively). The replacement of Cys559 and Cys561 (the two first cysteines of the tetracysteine motif) by alanines was performed with the ChameleonTM double-stranded site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The sequence of the mutagenic oligonucleotide was: 5′-CCGACGAACCAGAAAGCTTCGGCTGGAAAGGAAATGAGG-3′ (mutated positions are underlined), resulting in a change of the two cysteine codons TGT into two alanine codons, GCT. Mutants were identified by DNA sequencing of the plasmid DNA. The zinc content of wild type and mutant proteins was determined both by a colorimetric method and flame atomic absorption spectroscopy. The colorimetric assay was conducted as follows. A solution of 2.5 mm p-hydroxy(mercuri)benzenesulfonate (PMPS) was added by increments of 1 μl to a 500-μl sample of 10 μm of enzyme (in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol) containing 0.1 mm 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol (PAR). Zinc release from the enzyme was monitored by absorbance at 500 nm of the PAR2·Zn(II) complex for which molar absorptivity is 6.6 104m−1cm−1 (16Hunt J.B. Neece S.H. Ginsburg A. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 146: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The zinc content determination using flame atomic absorption was performed using a Varian AA775 spectrometer. The protein samples (49 μm) were dialyzed against a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 150 mm KCl. The instrument was calibrated using a solution of ZnCl2. Measurements were performed with three dilutions of the enzyme and using dialysis buffer as a blank. Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence was measured at 20 °C in a Bio-Tek SFM25 spectrofluorimeter. The excitation wavelength was 295 nm. Fluorescence measurements were carried out in a buffer composed of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm DTT, and 150 mm KCl with a protein concentration of 0.5 μm. The reaction mixture (10 μl) contained 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm DTT, 30 μg/ml BSA, 10 mm MgCl2, 120 mmNaCl, and 200 ng of negatively supercoiled plasmid DNA (pTZ 18). The reaction was initiated by adding purified topoisomerase I, which was serially diluted in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, and 100 μg/ml BSA. After 30 min of incubation at 75 or 50 °C (or as otherwise indicated), the reaction was stopped by adding 2 μl of stop solution containing 50 mm EDTA, 2.5% SDS, 25% glycerol, and 0.2% bromphenol blue. Samples were electrophoresed through 1.2% agarose gel in TEP buffer (90 mm Tris-phosphate, pH 8.0, 2 mmEDTA) for 2.5 h at 4 V/cm. Gels were stained with 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide and photographed under UV light. The reaction mixture was identical to that used in the DNA relaxation assay except that negatively supercoiled pTZ 18 was replaced by 200 ng of kinetoplast DNA (TopoGEN). The activity was measured using serial dilutions of enzymes. Incubations were performed for 30 min at 75 °C as described in the paragraph above. The incubation products were analyzed by treatment with 0.5 units of XhoI (New England Biolabs) for 30 min at 37 °C. For the control of kDNA decatenation with human topoisomerase II (TopoGEN), 2 units of enzyme and 1 mm ATP were added to the reaction mixture, and the incubation was performed at 37 °C for 30 min. After the addition of the stop solution, samples were electrophoresed and stained as described above. When required, 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide was added in gel and electrophoresis buffer. Oligonucleotides were synthesized and purified by MWG Biotec. 10 pmol were 5′-end-labeled by 5 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) in the presence of 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 10 μl of the buffer recommended by the manufacturer. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by heating the samples at 75 °C for 15 min. The oligonucleotide size markers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were labeled following the manufacturer's protocol. 0.1 pmol of 5′-end-labeled oligonucleotide was incubated with 1 pmol of T. maritimatopoisomerase in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.5 mm DTT, 30 μg/ml BSA, and 60 mm NaCl for 15 min at 75 °C (unless otherwise indicated) in a final volume of 10 μl. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1% SDS and 10 μl of loading buffer (97.5% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.3% bromphenol blue, 0.3% xylene cyanol). The samples were denatured by heating at 95 °C for 3 min and loaded onto a 18% polyacrylamide gel (19:1) containing 50% (w/v) urea in TBE buffer (90 mmTris, 90 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA). The gel was electrophoresed at 1300 V for 2 h and autoradiographed. Quantification was performed with the ImageQuant v1.2 software. After amplification of the T. maritimatopoisomerase I gene by polymerase chain reaction from genomic DNA and subcloning into the pET29b expression vector, the recombinant protein was expressed in E. coli. Expression and purification steps are summarized in Fig. 2. Induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C led to the production of an additional protein migrating to the expected molecular mass of the recombinant T. maritimatopoisomerase I (76 kDa) on SDS-polyacrylamide gel (lane 2). A 15-min heating step at 75 °C led to the elimination of most of theE. coli proteins, which precipitate at this temperature, whereas the thermophilic topoisomerase remained soluble (lane 4). This fraction was further purified on a heparin-Sepharose column, and topoisomerase I eluted from the column at around 0.6m NaCl. The eluate contained nearly pure topoisomerase (lane 5). To eliminate traces of a remaining nuclease contaminant, we finally performed an exclusion gel chromatography (Superdex S200). The resulting purified protein is shown in lane 6. We obtained about 2–3 mg of T. maritimatopoisomerase I from 1 liter of culture. To determine the functional relevance of the predicted zinc-binding domain described in Fig. 1, the two first cysteines of the tetracysteine motif were replaced by two alanines (C559A/C561A mutant) using site-directed mutagenesis, thus preventing a potential coordination of a zinc atom by the cysteine residues. We also performed a mutagenesis on Tyr288 of the active site (Y288F mutant) to produce an inactive form of the enzyme used as a control. The two mutant proteins were purified to near homogeneity (Fig.2, lanes 7 and 8) by the same procedure used to purify the wild type enzyme. To determine whether one zinc atom was indeed bound to the unique putative zinc binding site of T. maritima topoisomerase I, the zinc content was titrated by using the sulfhydryl reagent PMPS. This compound is known to release zinc(II) from zinc-binding proteins by modification of cysteine residues (17Hunt J.B. Neece S.H. Schachman H.K. Ginsburg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14793-14803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of the metallochrome indicator PAR allowed us to monitor the amount of Zn(II) released due to the formation of the PAR·Zn(II) complex, which absorbs at 500 nm (Fig. 3). Using the molecular absorptivity of 6.6.104m−1 cm−1 at this wavelength and a maximal absorbance of 0.658 for the wild type enzyme, the calculated stoichiometry was around one zinc atom (0.98)/molecule of topoisomerase I. Similar results were obtained by using the atomic absorption spectroscopy (results not shown). By contrast, the zinc content analysis of the C559A/C561A mutant revealed no detectable zinc bound to the enzyme. From this analysis, we conclude that T. maritima topoisomerase I is indeed able to coordinate one zinc atom and that alteration of the zinc-binding domain totally abolishes the ability of the protein to bind zinc. To investigate the potential conformational changes that could affect the mutant proteins, fluorescence emission spectra upon excitation at 295 nm of wild type and mutant enzymes were compared (Fig. 4). At this wavelength, the fluorescence essentially monitors the local environment of tryptophan residues. Four tryptophans are present in T. maritima topoisomerase I at positions 94, 156, 365, and 410 (4Bouthier de la Tour C. Kaltoum H. Portemer C. Confalonieri F. Huber R. Duguet M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The wild type enzyme fluorescence spectrum is characterized by a maximum emission wavelength at 335 nm (Fig. 4, curve a). Whereas no significant change was observed in the emission fluorescence spectrum of the active site Y288F mutant (curve b), the spectral properties of the C559A/C561A mutant were significantly affected. A red shift from 335 to 344 nm in the fluorescence emission maximum occurred concomitantly with an increase in fluorescence intensity (curve c). These data suggest that the microenvironment around one or several tryptophan residues changes in the protein that has lost the ability to bind zinc. The same differences in spectra were observed between wild type and C559A/C561A mutant when experiments were performed at 60 instead of 20 °C (results not shown). We first measured the relaxation of a negatively supercoiled DNA by serial dilutions of the wild type enzyme in a buffer containing 10 mm MgCl2. Fig.5 A shows that as little as 0.1 fmol of T. maritima topoisomerase I is sufficient to completely transform 100 fmol of the plasmid DNA after 30 min of incubation at 75 °C. This very high activity level is at least 100-fold greater than that of E. coli topoisomerase I (18Zhu C.X. Qi H.Y. Tse-Dinh Y.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 19Zhu C.X. Roche C.J. Papanicolaou N. DiPietrantonio A. C T.-D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8783-8789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 20Zechiedrich E.L. Khodursky A.B. Bachellier S. Schneider R. Chen D. Lilley D.M. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8103-8113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The optimal temperature of incubation for the assay was around 75 °C (Fig. 5 B), although a significant activity was still observed at 37 °C when 1 pmol of topoisomerase I was added to the reaction mixture (results not shown). An examination of the effect of mutations on the relaxation activity showed that the Y288F mutant is totally inactive (Fig.5 A) even with an amount of protein 10,000-fold higher than that used to observe activity of the wild type enzyme. This result indicates that Tyr288, defined as the active site tyrosine from sequence analysis, is probably the amino acid involved in the DNA cleavage step of the topoisomerase reaction. An unexpected result was obtained with the C559A/C561A mutant, which exhibited an activity similar to that of the wild type enzyme (Fig.5 A) with the same optimal temperature for activity (Fig.5 B). This result contrasts with E. colitopoisomerase I for which the apoenzyme without zinc is totally inactive in DNA relaxation (13Tse-Dinh Y.-C. Beran-Steed R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15857-15859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Tse-Dinh Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14317-14320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the thermostability of the C559A/C561A mutant is comparable with that of the wild type enzyme (Fig. 6). In these assays, enzymes were incubated at 80 °C for 30 min prior to measurement of the remaining DNA relaxation activity. To increase the accuracy of measurements, the test temperature was lowered to 50 °C allowing an increase in the amount of enzyme (i.e. reduction of the dilution factors). The results show that both wild type and C559A/C561A mutant enzymes remained fully active after 30 min at 80 °C, suggesting that zinc binding is not involved in the thermostability of T. maritima topoisomerase I. In regard to the relaxation results, we were interested in analyzing other enzymatic properties of the T. maritimatopoisomerase I and comparing them with those of the mutant enzymes. Besides relaxation, another test for type I topoisomerases is their ability to decatenate nicked DNA. In E. coli, topoisomerase I is able to decatenate double-stranded DNA intertwined dimers provided that one of the circular DNA molecules contains a nick (21Tse Y.C. Wang J.C. Cell. 1980; 22 (a): 269-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In addition, another type I topoisomerase present in this organism, topoisomerase III, was identified as a potent decatenase (22DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13366-13373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) efficient in the resolution of plasmid replication intermediates in vitro (23Hiasa H. DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2093-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of T. maritima, an analysis of the whole genome sequence (24Nelson K.E. Clayton R.A. Gill S.R. Gwinn M.L. Dodson R.J. Haft D.H. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Nelson W.C. Ketchum K.A. McDonald L. Utterback T.R. Malek J.A. Linher K.D. Garrett M.M. Stewart A.M. Cotton M.D. Pratt M.S. Phillips C.A. Richardson D.

Fraser C.M. et al.Nature. 1999; 399: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar) did not reveal the presence of a topoisomerase III equivalent. We therefore investigated the ability ofT. maritima topoisomerase I and its mutant forms to decatenate kinetoplast DNA (Fig. 7), a substrate usually dedicated to topoisomerase II assays and never tested with a topoisomerase I. This particular DNA forms a network of interlinked minicircles in which a significant fraction can be nicked. When kDNA was incubated with T. maritima topoisomerase I at 75 °C under the conditions of the DNA relaxation assay, a product appeared that migrated as nicked circles in an agarose gel containing ethidium bromide (Fig. 7 A, lane 1). A fraction of kDNA was not transformed (material remaining in the well). As a control and to confirm the nature of the decatenation product observed, we performed a decatenation assay with human topoisomerase II, which is known to decatenate interlinked minicircles (25Miller K.G. Liu L.F. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9334-9339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The electrophoretic pattern (Fig. 7 A, lane 2) showed that the totality of the kDNA was transformed and yielded two products, one of them migrating as nicked circles and the other exhibiting a higher electrophoretic mobility presumably corresponding to closed circular monomers. This assay confirmed the presence of both intact and nicked minicircles in the kDNA. The products of incubation of kDNA withT. maritima topoisomerase I were further treated byXhoI endonuclease, which cuts once by minicircle; linear monomers were obtained that migrated as the digestion product of kDNA by XhoI (Fig. 7 A, lanes 3 and4). From these results, we conclude that T. maritima topoisomerase I is able to decatenate interlinked DNA if a nick is present on the molecules to be decatenated. Again, the decatenase activity of wild type and C559A/C561A mutant enzymes showed no significant difference (Fig. 7 B). Nicked DNA circles were still produced by incubation with 0.2 pmol of either protein. As expected, the Y288F mutant was totally inactive (Fig.7 B). In their catalytic mechanism, type I topoisomerases transiently cleave one DNA strand to permit strand passage through the break and then reseal the cleaved strand. Although all type IA topoisomerases cleave single-stranded DNA by linking to the 5′-phosphoryl end of cleaved DNA, the specificity of the cleavage sequence is somewhat variable. The derived consensus sequence is CTT↓ for E. coli topoisomerase III (26Zhang H.L. DiGate R.J. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2092807846,"Receptor desensitization provides a potential mechanism for the regulation of adrenocortical adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) responsiveness. Using the mouse adrenocortical Y1 cell line we demonstrate that ACTH effectively desensitizes the cAMP response of its own receptor, the melanocortin 2 receptor (MC2R), in these cells with a maximal effect between 30 and 60 min. Neither forskolin nor isoproterenol (in Y1 cells stably transfected with the β2-adrenergic receptor) desensitize this ACTH response. ACTH desensitizes its receptor at concentrations at which only a fraction of receptors are occupied, implying that this mechanism acts on agonist-unoccupied receptors. Y1 cells express G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) 2 and 5, but stable expression of a dominant negative GRK2 (K220W) only marginally reduces the desensitization by ACTH. The protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, H89, extinguishes almost the entire desensitization response over the initial 30-min period at all concentrations of ACTH. A mutant MC2R in which the single consensus PKA phosphorylation site has been mutated (S208A) when expressed in MC2R-negative Y6 cells is also unable to desensitize. These data imply a heterologous, PKA-dependent, mode of desensitization, which is restricted to agonist-occupied and -unoccupied MC2R, possibly as a consequence of receptor/effector complexes that functionally compartmentalize this receptor.

The physiological effect of ACTH in steroidogenesis is mediated by the ACTH receptor, also known as the melanocortin 2 receptor (MC2R) (1Lefkowitz R.J. Roth J. Pricer W. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The MC2R is homologous to the other four cloned melanocortin receptors (8Mountjoy K.G. Cone R.D. The Melanocortin Receptors. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2000: 209-235Crossref Google Scholar, 9Clark A.J.L. Cammas F.M. Sheppard M. Franklyn J. Bailliere's Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism. 10:1. Bailliere Tindall, London1996: 29-47Google Scholar), which together form a distinct subfamily of the seven transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). It has long been known that the binding of ACTH to its receptor stimulates adenylate cyclase, elevating cAMP (10Haynes R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 1220-1222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) leading to activation of PKA and consequently stimulation of expression of steroidogenic enzymes. Sensitivity of the adrenal cortex to the actions of ACTH is therefore dependent to a large extent on the expression or function of the MC2R. There is evidence that high concentrations of ACTH may regulate MC2R gene expression (11Penhoat A. Jaillard C. Saez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4978-4981Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 12Lebrethon M-C. Naville D. Begeot M. Saez J.M. J. Clin.

Endocrinol. 1994; 99: R17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However it seems more likely that short term changes in sensitivity are determined at a receptor level by the extent of its coupling to the adenylate cyclase pathways. Previous studies have shown that adenylate cyclase activity and cAMP levels in the mouse adrenocortical Y1 cell line, which expresses a functional MC2R, decrease after repeated ACTH stimulation (14Morera A-M. Cathiard A-M. Saez J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 83: 1553-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 15Watt V.M. Schimmer B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1684-1689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) although the molecular mechanisms underlying this observation have remained obscure. Many other GPCRs exhibit the phenomenon of desensitization, which is traditionally described as being either heterologous or homologous in nature. In heterologous desensitization activation of several different receptor types may desensitize the receptor in question, and this is typically mediated by phosphorylation by nonspecific cellular kinases such as PKA or protein kinase C (16Hausdorff W.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2881-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar, 17Ferguson S.S. Barak L.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. Can. J. Physiol.

In homologous desensitization only the agonist-occupied receptor is able to desensitize itself by a process involving activation of a GRK, which phosphorylates serine/threonine residues in the receptor, leading to its binding to an arrestin molecule with consequent interference in G protein coupling (16Hausdorff W.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2881-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar, 17Ferguson S.S. Barak L.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. Can. J. Physiol.

In this report we have characterized the nature of the desensitization process of the endogenous MC2R in the mouse Y1 cell. We find that desensitization has some characteristics of a homologous process, yet is clearly PKA-dependent. Cell culture reagents were purchased from Sigma- Aldrich (Dorset, UK) and Life Technologies, Inc. (Paisley, Scotland, UK). ACTH (1–24) and norleucine4d-phenylalanine7-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (NDP-MSH) was purchased from Peninsula Laboratories (St. Helen's, Merseyside, UK) and H89 (N-[2-((p-bromocinnamyl)amino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulphonamide,2HCl) was from Calbiochem (Nottingham, UK). Y1 mouse adrenal tumor cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and the derived mutant cell line Y6 (a gift from B. Schimmer) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% horse serum and 2.5% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere at 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates 24–48 h prior to stimulation with ACTH-(1–24) and incubated in serum-free medium for at least 1 h prior to stimulation. Cells were stimulated in the presence of 1 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) for 30 min at 37 °C. After incubation, cells were heated at 100 °C for 5 min, centrifuged to precipitate cell debris, and the supernatant was stored for assay. cAMP was determined by a competitive binding assay (19Brown B.L. Albano J.D. Ekins R.P. Sgherzi A.M. Tampion W. Biochem. J. 1971; 121: 561-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). Protein content in the samples was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Cells were stimulated first with either ACTH (10−8m) or in some experiments with isoproterenol (10−5m) or forskolin (10−6m) for varying lengths of time. The cells were then washed with serum-free medium and restimulated with ACTH (10−8m) in the presence of IBMX (1 mm) for 30 min in this collection phase. Serine 208 on the third intracellular loop was changed to an alanine using the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene, Amsterdam, Netherlands). The mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cells were grown in 9-cm dishes to 50% confluence and transfected with 10–20 μg of DNA per plate using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (total amount of plasmid was adjusted by vector DNA). After 48 h, cells were selected in Geneticin (300 μg/ml). Medium was changed every 3–4 days. Resistant colonies appear after about 2 weeks, and these were isolated by ring cloning and expanded to produce stable cell lines. RNA was extracted using RNAzolTM B (Biogenesis, Poole, UK). The reverse transcription reaction was performed as follows: 10 μg of total RNA was mixed with oligo(dT) (5 μm) and heated to 75 °C for 5 min and then chilled on ice for 5 min. After this, 5× RT buffer, dNTPs (0.4 mm), and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (200 units/μl) were added and incubation was at 37 °C for 1 h. PCR was carried out on 2 μl of cDNA in a 50-μl reaction usingTaq polymerase. The primers were designed based on the rat GRK2, -3, -5, and -6 to obtain products of different sizes (primer sequences available on request). The fragments were visualized after electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. Y1 cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The samples were spun at 6500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was aspirated, and the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer. Prior to use the total cell lysate was heated to 85 °C for 10 min and reconstituted using a fine needle attached to a syringe. Proteins were resolved by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (PerkinElmer Life Science Products, Boston, MA), and then probed with either GRK2 or GRK5 primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Chemiluminescent detection of proteins was performed with ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All data presented are the means (± S.E.) of three or more independent experiments with all points determined in duplicate or triplicate within experiments and each assayed in duplicate. Dose-response curves were analyzed by GraphPad Prism (GraphPAD Software, San Diego, CA). Where appropriate, statistical significance was determined by Student's t test or by two-way analysis of variance using MS Excel. cAMP is produced in a dose-responsive manner after a single stimulation of Y1 cells with ACTH giving an EC50 of 1.3 × 10−8m in the presence of IBMX (Fig. 1 a). Following a single stimulus, the production and accumulation of cAMP increases steadily with time until 120 min, after which it reaches a plateau. In the absence of IBMX, cAMP does not accumulate and is undetectable (data not shown). The existence of other melanocortin receptors in these cells was excluded by demonstrating that NDP-MSH, a superagonist peptide that stimulates all of the melanocortin receptors except the MC2R, failed to generate a cAMP response. Thus in Y1 cells, ACTH signals exclusively through the MC2R. Desensitization of the MC2R can be detected following only 5 min of pre-exposure to ACTH, and the extent of desensitization increased gradually for periods of time up to 6 h (Fig. 1 c and data not shown). We wished to determine whether this desensitization was of a homologous or heterologous nature. Because cAMP responses to several agonists other than ACTH could not readily be identified in the Y1 cell, the rat β2-adrenergic receptor was stably transfected into the Y1 cell line. Previous studies have shown that the transfection of this receptor into Y1 cells results in a fully functional adenylate cyclase-coupled receptor that is able to produce the morphological changes that accompany cAMP production (20Allen J.M. Baetge E.E. Abrass I.B. Palmiter R.D. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Clonal Y1-β2-AR cells that responded to both isoproterenol and ACTH were selected for further study. The extent of the cAMP response to a single stimulus with isoproterenol (10−5m) or forskolin (10−5m) is shown in Fig. 1 b. Desensitization of the MC2R was investigated after preincubation with isoproterenol (10−5m) for varying times. As shown in Fig. 1 c this treatment clearly did not desensitize the MC2R and if anything appeared to enhance the response to ACTH (10−8m). A similar absence of desensitization was also seen after preincubation of untransfected Y1 cells with forskolin (10−5m) (Fig. 1 c). These findings support the notion that MC2R desensitization is homologous in nature and consequently likely to be mediated by one or more of the six recognized GRKs. GRK 1 and 4 are expressed predominantly in the retina and testis (21Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). The expression of GRKs 2, 3, 5, and 6 was investigated by RT-PCR analysis of total RNA in Y1 cells and revealed that only GRK 2 and 5 are expressed in this cell line (Fig. 2 a). Immunoblotting confirms these findings (Fig. 2 b). The possible function of these kinases in MC2R desensitization was tested using a dominant negative GRK (22Tsuga H. Kameyama K. Haga T. Kurose H. Nagao T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32522-32527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Ferguson S.S.G. Menard L. Barak L.S. Koch W.J. Colapietro A.M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24782-24789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Stable Y1 cell lines expressing the K220W GRK2 mutant were created, and the pattern of desensitization was investigated. The results show that there is a degree of inhibition of desensitization at all time points with the dominant negative GRK, although these differences do not achieve statistical significance (Fig. 2 c). As this result suggests that other kinases might be involved, the role of PKA was investigated. H89 used in concentrations that are specific for PKA inhibition (10−7m) (24Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was highly effective in blocking the initial phase of MC2R desensitization (Fig.3 a). Because the mechanism of desensitization of this receptor might depend on the degree of receptor occupancy and hence the desensitizing concentration of ACTH, a desensitization dose response curve was constructed with or without H89. Fig. 3 b shows that in the absence of H89 50% maximal desensitization was achieved at 8.5 × 10−10m ACTH. The inhibitory effect of H89 on desensitization was complete at all concentrations of ACTH studied. The third intracellular loop of the MC2R contains a single putative PKA consensus phosphorylation site (25Glass D.B. El-Maghrabi M.R. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2987-2993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the MC2R (RKIST) centered around Ser-208. This site is conserved in the MC2R across species. This residue was changed to an alanine by site-directed mutagenesis, and the mutated gene (S208A) was stably expressed in Y6 cells. The Y6 cell is a cell line derived from the Y1 cell that fails to express the endogenous MC2R. It can be successfully used for exploring the function of transfected MC2Rs (26Yang Y.K. Ollmann M.M. Wilson B.D. Dickinson C. Yamada T. Barsh G.S. Gantz I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 27Elias L.L.K. Weber A. Pullinger G.D. Mirtella A. Clark A.J.L. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 84: 2766-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Stable cell lines expressing the wild type and S208A receptors were selected. These receptors expressed in Y6 cells have highly comparable function with very similar EC50 values (1.8 × 10−7m (wild type); 2.1 × 10−7m (S208A) although these values are about an order of magnitude greater than that of the endogenous MC2R expressed by Y1 cells (Figs. 1 a and 4 a). In addition, the basal cAMP values in these cell lines are greater than those in Y1 cells reflecting an intrinsic difference in the Y6 cell, as compared with the Y1 cell, under these conditions. In accordance with the result obtained using H89, desensitization is absent for the first 30–60 min in cells expressing S208A in comparison with the wild type MC2R-expressing cells (Fig.4 b). This finding supports the view that PKA is the principal kinase involved in MC2R desensitization and that its actions are mediated through a single consensus phosphorylation site. It has been demonstrated that PKA phosphorylation of the β2-adrenergic receptor leads to a switch in G protein coupling from Gαs to Gαi (26Yang Y.K. Ollmann M.M. Wilson B.D. Dickinson C. Yamada T. Barsh G.S. Gantz I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been proposed that the opposing action of Gαileads to a reversal and apparent desensitization of this receptor (25Glass D.B. El-Maghrabi M.R. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2987-2993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether a similar mechanism might be involved with the MC2R the desensitization of the MC2R in the presence of pertussis toxin to inhibit Gαi was investigated. Data shown in Fig.5 suggests that signaling is mediated solely by Gαs and that there is very little ACTH-dependent Gαi activity in these cells. The adrenal response to ACTH stimulation is of considerable importance in physiological and pathophysiological circumstances. Although there is evidence for the modulation of the MC2R at the level of gene expression (12Lebrethon M-C. Naville D. Begeot M. Saez J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1828-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 13Mountjoy K.G. Bird I.M. Rainey W.E. Cone R.D. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 99: R17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), this is not extensive or rapid, and it seems more probable that short term responsiveness is modulated at the receptor level by the processes of desensitization, sequestration, and down-regulation. Earlier studies have shown that the desensitization of ACTH-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity is readily detectable in Y1 cells and tends to be a more prominent phenomenon than the loss of cell surface binding observed after prolonged ACTH stimulation (14Morera A-M. Cathiard A-M. Saez J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 83: 1553-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 15Watt V.M. Schimmer B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1684-1689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have attempted to characterize the nature of MC2R desensitization using the mouse Y1 cell, which is the only cell line in which endogenous MC2R is normally expressed in sufficient numbers to make such a study feasible. In keeping with earlier data, we show that the MC2R desensitizes in response to ACTH relatively rapidly (given the limitations of the assay system). Treatment of cells with the β2-agonist, isoproterenol or with forskolin results in elevations of cAMP comparable to those achieved with ACTH, yet neither treatment desensitizes the MC2R. These characteristics are suggestive of homologous mechanisms of desensitization and imply the involvement of a GRK in this process. However the dominant negative GRK2 only weakly influences the normal pattern of desensitization. This result should be treated with caution because the inhibitory action of the mutant GRK2 requires there to be sufficient mutant protein to saturate potential GRK phosphorylation sites. Wild type GRK2 protein is fairly easily detected in Y1 cells and may be in adequate quantity to phosphorylate agonist-occupied MC2Rs despite the presence of the dominant negative enzyme. Furthermore, the inhibitory activity of GRK2 K220W on GRK5 phosphorylation is not clear, although the immunoblots suggest that the quantities of GRK5 may be less than those of GRK2 in this cell line. However we also show that the PKA antagonist H89 is capable of almost completely eradicating the early phase of desensitization at all concentrations of ACTH used. Y6 cells were stably transfected with an MC2R in which the sole consensus PKA phosphorylation site, Ser-208, was replaced. S208A and wild type MC2R-expressing cell lines show highly comparable dose response curves, yet the mutant receptor shows a similar effect on early desensitization (Fig. 4 b) as is seen when Y1 cells are treated with H89 (Fig. 3 a). This suggests that Ser-208 has an essential role in the mechanism of MC2R desensitization by ACTH. Thus desensitization of the endogenous Y1 cell MC2R exhibits a paradox. The mode of desensitization appears at first sight to be homologous in that agents other than ACTH that elevate intracellular cAMP do not desensitize the receptor. There may be other agonists that we have not studied that act through other signaling pathways that are capable of desensitizing this receptor, but it seems clear that elevation of cAMP should be able to activate existing heterologous desensitization mechanisms. Nevertheless there is good evidence for a major role for PKA mediation of this process. One possibility is that conformational changes in the MC2R following ligand binding result in Ser-208 only becoming accessible to PKA in the agonist-occupied state. In such a model activated PKA would be unable to phosphorylate the unliganded MC2R, and an apparent homologous form of desensitization will be observed. However the data in Fig.3 b indicates that the agonist concentration at which 50% of the maximum desensitization takes place, 8.5 × 10−10m, is an order of magnitude lower than the EC50for cAMP generation. This implies that receptor activation results in desensitization of both agonist-occupied and -unoccupied receptors, a feature typical of heterologous desensitization. Evidence is accumulating that many GPCRs exist in a complex with other components of the receptor regulation and cell signaling system including PKA, protein kinase C, β-arrestin, and phosphatases complexed with a member of the protein kinase A anchoring proteins (AKAPs) (28Luttrell L.M.

Such a complex may effectively compartmentalize the receptor-effector system in question and limit the accessibility of non-complexed PKA such as that activated by forskolin or the β2-adrenergic receptor. The influence of these AKAP complexes on desensitization of the adrenergic receptor has been investigated by suppression of their expression by antisense oligonucleotides and has revealed only an inhibition of receptor resensitization (33Lin F. Wang H-Y. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19025-19034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However these studies only investigated desensitization by a single agonist, isoproterenol, so that any potential role of AKAPs in restricting PKA-mediated desensitizing mechanisms remains to be investigated. The discordance between desensitization dose responsiveness and the EC50 argues against the model of a single receptor containing complex and is suggestive of complexes containing two or more molecules of receptor. This would enable the co-existence in a single complex of both agonist-occupied and -unoccupied MC2R. There is considerable evidence that many GPCRs exist as dimers or oligomers (34Bouvier M. Nat. Rev. Neurosc. 2001; 2: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar), although such evidence has not yet been obtained for the MC2R. An alternative to this model is that rather than desensitizing, the receptor switches its coupling to the opposing Gαisignaling pathway. A precedent for this has been described in the case of the β2-adrenergic receptor in which Daaka et al. (35Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar) demonstrated that agonist-induced PKA phosphorylation of the receptor switches its G protein coupling, enabling Gαi-coupled MAP kinase signaling and inhibition of adenylate cyclase to occur (35Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). Under these circumstances inhibition of cyclase has been proposed as an additional mechanism of apparent receptor desensitization (36Tepe N.M. Liggett S.B. J. Recep. & Signal Trans. Res. 2000; 20: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However we have been able to show in the case of the MC2R that pertussis toxin has no influence on the pattern of desensitization, and hence this mechanism is unlikely to be relevant to this receptor. In summary, we have demonstrated a major role for PKA in desensitization of the MC2R and that Ser-208 in the third intracellular loop is the probable target for PKA-mediated phosphorylation. However, in contrast to most PKA-mediated desensitization models, MC2R desensitization appears to be insensitive to PKA activation from heterologous sources.

The prototypical erythroid protein 4.1R80 is, therefore, only one of many isoforms that are generated by a single gene, mainly by extensive alternative splicing of the 4.1R pre-mRNA (20Tang T.K.

The synthesis of isoforms, termed 4.1R135, containing up to 209 amino acids to the NH2 terminus of erythroid 4.1R80, occurs when the 17-nucleotide sequence containing the upstream ATG (ATG1) translation initiation codon is included. These isoforms are predominantly expressed in nonerythroid cells (20Tang T.K. Leto T.L. Correas I. Alonso M.A. Marchesi V.T. Benz Jr., E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A third type of isoforms, termed 4.1R60, can be produced in erythroid and nonerythroid cells when both the 17-nucleotide sequence (containing the ATG1) and exon 4 (containing the ATG2) are spliced out, and translation is initiated from a third translation initiation site (ATG3) present in exon 8 (16Gascard P.

Although the major functions of 4.1R80 protein have been extensively characterized in mature erythrocytes, the potential roles of 4.1R isoforms in nucleated cells have only begun to be characterized. It has been reported that 4.1R protein interacts with various splicing factors (15Lallena M.J. Correas I. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 239-247PubMed Google Scholar, 24Lallena M.J. Martı́nez C.

Blood. 1998; 92: 1442-1447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an integral chloride channel component which was recently shown to associate also with spliceosomal proteins (26Pu W.T. Krapivinsky G.B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4113-4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar); with a novel centrosomal protein, termed CPAP (27Hung L.Y. Tang C.J. Tang T.K. Mol. Cell.

All of these observations indicate that, in nucleated cells, isoforms of 4.1R protein may play roles in organizing the nuclear architecture and mitotic spindle poles. These roles were not suspected from the initial studies, given that they were performed in anucleate, nondividing, human red blood cells. Interactions of 4.1R with other proteins have also been reported (28Nunomura W. Takakuwa Y. Tokimitsu R. Krauss S.W. Kawashima M. Mohandas N. J. Biol.

In an attempt to characterize further the functional roles and partners of nonerythroid 4.1R isoforms, we have analyzed 4.1R distribution in human T cells and observed that both endogenous and exogenous 4.1R proteins colocalized with the microtubule skeleton. In vivoand in vitro biochemical analyses confirmed an association between 4.1R and microtubules. We have determined that a region conserved in all 4.1R isoforms, previously designated by us as the “core region” (18Luque C.M. Correas I. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2485-2495PubMed Google Scholar), was involved in tubulin binding and that 22 amino acids containing leucine residues, organized as heptad repeats, were essential for the interaction. Our results indicate that both ATG1- and ATG2-translated 4.1R isoforms are able to associate with microtubules in interphase human T cells, suggesting the involvement of 4.1R in the microtubule architecture. The finding that ectopic expression of 4.1R in COS-7 cells resulted in disorganization of the microtubule architecture supports the hypothesis that the functional activity of protein 4.1R depends on the cell type in which the protein is expressed. The cell lines used in this study were human T lymphoid Jurkat and CEM cells and fibroblastic COS-7 cells. Jurkat and CEM cells were grown in tissue culture flasks in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). COS-7 cells were grown on culture dishes or on glass coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Both media were supplemented with 1% glutamine, 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 units/ml).

For immunoblot analysis, protein fractions were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore) in Tris borate buffer, pH 8.2. Membranes were processed and developed as described (13De Cárcer G. Lallena M.J. Correas I. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). CEM cells were harvested by centrifugation and then resuspended in 1/10 of buffer A (0.1 m MES, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA) containing 10 μg/ml pepstatin, leupeptin, aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were lysed in 4 °C hypotonic buffer by 25 passages through a 22G1-gauge needle fitted onto a plastic syringe. 10× buffer A was added to the extract to obtain isotonic buffer A. The lysate was centrifuged at high speed in a minicentrifuge at 4 °C and processed as described (40Charrasse S. Schroeder M. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Ango F. Cassimeris L. Gard D.L. Larroque C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1371-1383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the pellet was discarded and the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C in a Beckman TL-100 Tabletop Ultracentrifuge using a TLA-100.1 fixed-angle rotor. The pellet, corresponding to the membrane-containing fraction, was discarded. The supernatant was supplemented with 10 μm Taxol and 0.1 mm GTP and incubated for 35 min at 37 °C. Microtubules were centrifuged through a 15% sucrose cushion in buffer A containing 5 μm Taxol (30,000 × g, 35 min, 37 °C). The microtubule pellets and supernatants were boiled in Laemmli buffer and analyzed by Western blotting with 9E10, 10b, or 762 antibodies. PC-tubulin from bovine brain (41Weingarten M.D. Lockwood A.H. Hwo S.Y. Kirschner M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 1858-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (2230) Google Scholar) was polymerized as described (36Wittmann T. Boleti H. Antony C. Karsenti E. Vernos I. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 673-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), mixed with recombinant proteins in buffer BRB80 (80 mm K-Pipes, pH 6.8, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm MgCl2) containing 10 μm Taxol, and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The samples were centrifuged through a 15% sucrose cushion in BRB80, as described previously (36Wittmann T. Boleti H. Antony C. Karsenti E. Vernos I. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 673-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Equivalent aliquots of supernatants and pellets were analyzed on Coomassie-stained gels and Western blots probed with anti-GST antibody. To understand how 4.1R is distributed in human T cells, we analyzed CEM cells, fixed in the absence (Fig. 2 A) or in the presence (Fig. 2 B) of Triton X-100, by confocal microscopy. Fig. 2 A (a) shows a representative image of cells stained with the anti-4.1R 10b antibody. Diffuse cytoplasmic staining, which was more concentrated at the pericentrosomal region, and staining of both discrete cytoplasmic filaments and the plasma membrane were observed. Nuclear staining (not shown in this confocal plane) was also detected. The cytoplasmic filaments decorated with antibody 10b corresponded to microtubules, as revealed by the anti-tubulin DM1A antibody (Fig. 2 A, b). Microtubules were also decorated with the anti-4.1R 762 antibody, which recognizes the extra amino-terminal region of 4.1R135 isoforms (35Luque C.M. Lallena M.J. Pérez-Ferreiro C.M. de Isidro Y. De Cárcer G. Alonso M.A. Correas I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14925-14930Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) (Fig.2 A, c and d). These results indicated that the microtubule network of human T cells contains 4.1R epitopes. The 4.1R staining pattern of CEM cells fixed in the presence of Triton X-100 is shown in Fig. 2 B. The Triton X-100 treatment resulted in the extraction of most of the 4.1R immunoreactivity; however, nuclear speckles and a bright spot in the pericentrosomal region were clearly observed in cells stained with the 10b antibody (Fig. 2 B, a). The bright spot was stained with antibodies that recognize the centrosome (Fig. 2 B,b). Antibody 762 did not stain the centrosome (Fig.2 B, c). These results show that centrosomal 4.1R immunoreactivity is better detected when cells are fixed in the presence of Triton X-100. To identify specific 4.1R isoforms that colocalize with microtubules, we transfected T cells with different 4.1R cDNAs previously isolated by us from human T cells (18Luque C.M. Correas I. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2485-2495PubMed Google Scholar, 35Luque C.M. Lallena M.J. Pérez-Ferreiro C.M. de Isidro Y. De Cárcer G. Alonso M.A. Correas I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14925-14930Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and compared the intracellular distribution of the expressed 4.1R proteins and that of tubulin by confocal microscopy. Two of the 4.1R cDNAs (4.1R80Δ16 and 4.1R80Δ16,19) encode 4.1R isoforms that are translated from the ATG-2 translation initiation codon present in exon 4 (Fig.1 B), whereas the other three 4.1R cDNAs (4.1R135Δ16, 4.1R135Δ16,19, and 4.1R135Δ4,5,16) encode 4.1R isoforms that are translated from the 5′ upstream-ATG-1 translation initiation site (Fig.1 B). The only difference between the isoforms 4.1R135Δ16 and 4.1R135Δ16,19 and their respective counterparts 4.1R80Δ16 and 4.1R80Δ16,19 is that the first two have the 209-amino acid NH2-terminal extension. Fig. 3 shows confocal microscopy images of Jurkat T cells transiently expressing the 4.1R isoforms and double-stained with 10b (10b) and DM1A (DM1A) antibodies. Antibody 10b was highly diluted to react only with the exogenously expressed 4.1R isoforms but not with the endogenous 4.1R proteins. All 4.1R isoforms localized to cytoplasmic filaments (Fig. 3, A(a, c, and e) and B(a and c)) that were also stained by the tubulin-recognizing monoclonal antibody DM1A (Fig. 3 A(b, d, and f) and B(b and d)). The distribution of the exogenously expressed 4.1R isoforms on the microtubule network resembled that of the endogenous 4.1R proteins (compare Figs.2 and3). To determine whether 4.1R and microtubules interacted in vivo, we performed biochemical assays using T cells stably transfected with either 4.1R135Δ16 or 4.1R80Δ16 cDNAs. Taxol-polymerized microtubules were isolated from these cells by centrifugation through a sucrose cushion, and the presence or absence of the expressed 4.1R proteins in the pellet fractions was analyzed by Western blot. Control cells, transfected with an empty plasmid, were processed in parallel. Expression of 4.1R135Δ16 and 4.1R80Δ16 in CEM cells was confirmed by Western blot analysis revealed with antibody 9E10 (Fig. 4 A), as the exogenous 4.1R isoforms were tagged at their COOH-terminal region with the 9E10 c-Myc epitope to distinguish them from the endogenous 4.1R proteins (19Luque C.M. Lallena M.J. Alonso M.A. Correas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11643-11649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Western blots of equivalent aliquots of microtubule pellets and supernatants isolated from control and transfected cells were revealed with 9E10 antibody (Fig. 4 B). Isoforms 4.1R135Δ16 and 4.1R80Δ16 were present in the microtubule pellets (Fig. 4 B, lanes 3 and5), suggesting their in vivo association with the tubulin skeleton. Duplicates of the microtubule pellet shown in Fig. 4 B(lane 1) were revealed with anti-4.1R antibodies to analyze endogenous 4.1R proteins cosedimenting in the microtubule pellet (Fig.4 C). Antibody 10b (Fig. 4 C, 10b) detected major bands of ∼80 and 145 kDa. Antibody 762 (Fig.4 C, 762) reacted with a 145-kDa band. These results and those obtained for the exogenously expressed 4.1R isoforms indicate that both ATG1- and ATG2-translated 4.1R isoforms cosediment with microtubules. To investigate whether 4.1R80Δ16 could bind directly to tubulin, the major component of microtubules, we prepared tubulin depleted in microtubule-associated proteins (PC-tubulin) and performed in vitro binding assays. Taxol-polymerized tubulin was incubated with a GST fusion protein containing 4.1R80Δ16 (GST-4.1R80Δ16) and processed as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” Protein GST-4.1R80Δ16 was detected in the pellet fraction with polymerized tubulin (Fig. 5 A,lane 1) but not in the supernatant fraction (Fig.5 A, lane 5). Similar results were confirmed by the blot analysis (Fig. 5 B, lanes 1 and5). To identify the 4.1R80Δ16 region interacting with tubulin, we fused various 4.1R fragments to GST (Fig.1 C) and assayed in vitro their ability to associate with PC-tubulin. Fig. 5 C shows a Coomassie-stained gel of the different GST fusion proteins used for the study. Protein GST-Cter (Fig. 5 C, lane 3) contained the carboxyl-terminal region of protein 4.1R80Δ16 (see Fig.1 C), and the GST-4.1R60Δ16,18 protein (Fig.5 C, lane 2) contained a short 4.1R isoform translated from the ATG3 triplet (18Luque C.M. Correas I. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2485-2495PubMed Google Scholar) whose sequence is comprised in 4.1R80Δ16 (see Fig. 1 C). Fig. 5(panels A (Coomassie-stained gels) andB (Western blots revealed with anti-GST)) shows that GST-4.1R60Δ16,18 protein was detected in the tubulin pellets (Fig. 5, A and B, lanes 2) but not in the supernatants (Fig. 5, A and B,lanes 6). By contrast, protein GST-Cter, assayed at two different concentrations, was observed in the supernatant fractions (Fig. 5, A and B, lanes 7 and8). The absence of GST-Cter protein from the tubulin pellets was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5 B, lanes 3 and 4). The fact that GST-Cter did not bind to tubulin, whereas the GST-4.1R60Δ16,18 and GST-4.1R80Δ16 proteins did, suggested that the common central region of the latter proteins, previously designated by us as “the core region” (18Luque C.M. Correas I. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2485-2495PubMed Google Scholar), was responsible for their association with tubulin. A GST fusion protein containing the core region (GST-core) was assayed for its tubulin binding ability. Fig.6 A shows the Coomassie-stained gel of the pellet and the supernatant fractions and Fig. 6 Bthe Western blot revealed with anti-GST antibody. Protein GST-core was present in the pellet with tubulin (Fig. 6, A andB, lanes 3) and absent in the supernatant (Fig.6, A and B, lanes 6). The fusion proteins GST-4.1R80Δ16 (Fig. 6, A andB, lanes 1 and 4) and GST-Cter (Fig.6, A and B, lanes 2 and 5) were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. These results confirmed that the core region, present in all 4.1R isoforms, is responsible for tubulin binding. Primary sequence analysis of the core region revealed that the NH2-terminal region of exon 10-encoded sequences comprised heptad repeats of leucine residues resembling a putative leucine zipper motif (Fig.7 A). To investigate whether this characteristic sequence was involved in tubulin association, we created a deletion mutant, termed core-Δleu, that lacked 22 amino acids from the leucine zipper-resembling motif (amino acidsboxed in Fig. 7 A), fused it to GST (GST-core-Δleu) (see Fig. 1 C), and determined its tubulin-binding capacity. As expected, GST-core was detected in the pellet fraction (Fig. 7, B and C, lanes 1), whereas GST-core-Δleu remained in the supernatant (Fig. 7,B and C, lanes 4), indicating that the 22-amino acid stretch containing the heptad repeats of leucine is essential for tubulin binding. COS-7 cells were transfected with 4.1R80Δ16 cDNA to compare the distribution pattern of the expressed 4.1R isoform with that of tubulin by double immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig.8). Isoform 4.1R80Δ16 did not result to colocalize with microtubules as it did in T cells but instead led to disorganization of the microtubule network (compare Fig.8 with Fig. 3 B, a and b). Similar disorganization of the microtubule architecture was also observed with other 4.1R cDNAs assayed (data not shown). A representative image of the altered microtubule network showing microtubules that no longer radiate from a single perinuclear focus is represented in Fig. 8. The great diversity of 4.1R isoforms present in nonerythroid cells makes it necessary to assay individual isoforms to specifically assign them cellular functions. In recent years, much effort has been concentrated on isolating 4.1R cDNAs from different cell sources for use in the assignment of roles and partners for specific 4.1R isoforms. In this study we show that naturally occurring exogenously expressed ATG1- and ATG2-translated 4.1R isoforms, and also endogenous 4.1R proteins, colocalize with the tubulin cytoskeleton of interphase human T cells. Cosedimentation of 4.1R proteins with microtubules of human T cells and direct in vitro binding to tubulin revealed that a common region present in all 4.1R isoforms, the core region, is responsible for the association of 4.1R with tubulin. This is the first demonstration of an association between 4.1R and interphase microtubules. It is of particular note that the 22-amino acid sequence required for 4.1R-tubulin interaction contains heptad repeats of leucine resembling leucine zippers (see Fig. 7 A) but, unlike the latter, it does not adopt an α-helix conformation (42O'Shea E.K. Rutkowski R. Kim P.S. Science. 1989; 243: 538-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the NH2-terminal 30-kDa domain of 4.1R has been determined and has the form of a three-lobed cloverleaf (43Han B.G. Nunomura W. Takakuwa Y. Mohandas N. Jap B.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 871-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal lobe contains two β-sheets and ends in an α-helix; one of the β-sheets contains the binding site for p55, a palmitoylated peripheral membrane protein belonging to a membrane-associated guanylate kinase homologue family of signaling and cytoskeletal proteins (7Nunomura W. Takakuwa Y. Parra M. Conboy J.G. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6360-6367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 44Marfatia S.M. Leu R.A. Branton D. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 715-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The 22 amino acids identified in this study as being required for 4.1R-tubulin associations would be located on the other β-sheet of the COOH-terminal lobe. Removal of the 22 amino acids would result in an almost complete absence of this β-sheet structure. Ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) proteins belong to the “4.1R protein family” and are thought to link actin filaments to the plasma membrane at cortical foci (45Bretscher A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Ezrin has also been isolated from microtubule-associated protein preparations from Madin-Darby canine kidney and A72 cells and the ERM protein merlin contains a “cryptic” microtubule binding site exposed specifically in the activated or “open” ERM conformation (reviewed in Ref. 45Bretscher A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been suggested that some ERM proteins may play an additional role in linking microtubules to the cell cortex, thus having the capacity to associate with the microtubule and actin cytoskeletons. One of the major functions of erythroid 4.1R is the stabilization of the spectrin-actin complex through the 10-kDa domain (2Correas I. Speicher D.W. Marchesi V.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13362-13366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Correas I. Leto T.L. Speicher D.W. Marchesi V.T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 21243-21250Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) encoded by exons 16 and 17. We may speculate that, in nonerythroid cells, 4.1R isoforms expressing the alternative exon 16 would have the capacity to bind to the actin and the microtubule cytoskeletons, whereas those 4.1R isoforms lacking exon 16 expression would only retain the ability to bind to the microtubule cytoskeleton. It has been indicated that nonerythroid 4.1R isoforms may have different functional activities, depending on the cell type in which they are expressed (31Kontrogianni-Konstantopoulos A. Frye C.S. Benz Jr., E.J. Huang S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20679-20687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, 4.1R interacts through its spectrin-actin binding domain with a protein complex in skeletal muscle (34Kontrogianni-Konstantopoulos A. Huang S.C. Benz Jr., E.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3805-3817Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) that differs from that described in PC12 cells (31Kontrogianni-Konstantopoulos A. Frye C.S. Benz Jr., E.J. Huang S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20679-20687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), even though the latter type of cell also contains the proteins to which 4.1R binds in skeletal muscle. Concomitantly, we show in this study that transfection of T cells with T cell-4.1R cDNAs resulted in overexpression of 4.1R isoforms colocalizing with the microtubule network, whereas ectopic expression of 4.1R isoforms in COS-7 cells did not result in 4.1R binding to the microtubules but instead in the disruption of the microtubule architecture. It is evident, therefore, that different cell types respond in distinct manners to the expression of 4.1R, supporting the hypothesis that some functional activities of protein 4.1R are cell type-regulated. A major difference between T and COS-7 cells is that T cells experiment internal protein rearrangements during polarization in response to many stimuli (see below). Whether some cell type-specific partners of 4.1R are required for specialized 4.1R roles remains to be established. Polarization is a key feature in the biology of T cells, as T lymphocytes acquire a polarized phenotype after activation, upon interaction with antigen-presenting cells, and during transendothelial migration. To extravasate, circulating lymphocytes must adopt a polarized flexible form suitable for tissue invasion. The anterior region of the polarized lymphocyte bears multiple, highly labile lamellipodia, whereas the posterior part is drawn out into a single slender appendage called the uropod (reviewed in Ref. 46Sanchez-Madrid F. del Pozo M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Polarization involves a reorganization of the cytoskeleton, including polymerization and redistribution of actin and a drastic reconfiguration of the tubulin cytoskeleton, which, in conjunction with the microtubule organizing center, retract into the uropod lumen, collapsing into a thin, compact sheaf. Microtubule retraction has been suggested as being a strategy for accelerating extravasation without disassembling the microtubule-based transport system (47Ratner S. Sherrod W.S. Lichlyter D. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1063-1067PubMed Google Scholar). The distribution of spectrin has been analyzed during lymphocyte activation, revealing a rapid reorganization of the protein, whereby the initial aggregated cytoplasmic structures are translocated to specific areas of the plasma membrane (48Lee J.K. Black J.D. Repasky E.A. Kubo R.T. Bankert R.B. Cell. 1988; 55: 807-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Different distributions are observed for proteins of the ERM family in T lymphocytes induced to polarize by chemokines. Thus, radixin colocalizes with myosin II in the neck of the uropod, whereas moesin is preferentially located at the uropod tip, interacting with the cytoplasmic tail of ICAM-3, CD43, and CD44 (49Serrador J.M. Alonso-Lebrero J.L. del Pozo M.A. Furthmayr H. Schwartz-Albiez R. Calvo J. Lozano F. Sanchez-Madrid F. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1409-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Interactions between 4.1R and CD44 have also been reported (28Nunomura W. Takakuwa Y. Tokimitsu R. Krauss S.W. Kawashima M. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30322-30328Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Further studies will be conducted to determine the behavior of 4.1R during T cell polarization, which may provide new clues for understanding the complex cytoskeletal reorganization experienced by this cell type.

Protein constituents are transported along the secretory pathway to thetrans-Golgi network (TGN)1 where they are sorted to either one of these two domains (3Matlin K.S. Simons K. J.

Specific inhibition ofO-glycosylation of intestinal sucrase-isomaltase with benzyl-GalNAc (benzyl-N-acetyl-α-d-galactosaminide) as well as deletion of the potentially O-glycosylated Ser/Thr-rich stalk domain abolished the high fidelity of apical sorting of SI and resulted in a random transport of the protein to both membranes (19Jacob R.

Naim H.Y. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 593-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Likewise, a dominantly O-glycosylated domain juxtapose the membrane of the neurotrophin receptor is presumably implicated in its apical sorting (14Yeaman C. Le Gall A.H. Baldwin A.N. Monlauzeur L. Le Bivic A. Rodriguez- Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 21Monlauzeur L. Breuza L. Le Bivic A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30263-30270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).It is not obvious, however, from these observations whetherO-glycans constitute the sorting signal per se, or they impose a particular folding determinant in the context of the actual sorting signal. Analysis of various deletion mutants of SI demonstrated that O-glycosylation and membrane anchoring of SI are required for the association of the enzyme with cholesterol and glycosphingolipid-rich lipid microdomains and subsequent apical sorting. Moreover, a possible role for an O-glycosylated Ser/Thr-rich stalk domain that immediately follows the membrane domain and belongs to the isomaltase subunit in the sorting of SI has emerged. However, SI comprises two strongly homologous subunits that are bothO-glycosylated and a possible contribution ofO-glycans in the sucrase subunit to the structure of a putative sorting signal cannot be excluded. The basic aim of this paper is to assess the requirements needed for an efficient sorting of apical proteins using the high polarized protein sucrase-isomaltase as a model. In particular, the role of O-glycans located in the stalk region of SI and the spatial constraints that influence an efficient recognition of these structures through putative sorting elements have been investigated. Using chimeras of the non-polarized protein model, the rat GH, fused to the stalk transmembrane domains of SI we could show that O-glycosylation is absolutely required for apical sorting. However, specific spatial requirements should be fulfilled for an efficient recognition of these glycans by a putative carbohydrate-binding protein.DISCUSSIONRecent observations have implicated O-linked glycans as possible apical sorting signals (14Yeaman C. Le Gall A.H. Baldwin A.N. Monlauzeur L. Le Bivic A. Rodriguez- Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 18Naim H.Y. Joberty G. Alfalah M. Jacob R. J.

Biol. 1999; 9: 593-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The selective delivery of intestinal SI to the apical membrane in polarized Caco-2 or MDCK cells could be attributed to O-glycosidically linked carbohydrates that function in concert with the transmembrane domain of SI in driving SI to associate with detergent-insoluble lipid microdomains (18Naim H.Y. Joberty G. Alfalah M. Jacob R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17961-17967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 19Jacob R. Alfalah M. Grunberg J. Obendorf M. Naim H.Y. J.

Biol. 1999; 9: 593-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In particular, the heavily O-glycosylated stalk domain of SI appears to constitute the main apical targeting signal. These observations, however, could not exclude a possible function of other heavily O-glycosylated domains in the apical sorting event of SI. The major focus of this report is therefore to determine whether the O-glycosylated stalk domain and the transmembrane region are sufficient to target SI to the apical membrane and possess therefore the exclusive function as a sorting signal per se. One approach is to fuse this stalk and the transmembrane domain to an unglycosylated and unsorted secretory protein. The rat GH fulfills adequately these criteria, and a chimeric protein containing rat GH fused to the stalk and transmembrane domains of SI (GH-SISR/TM) has been therefore used to delineate the function of these two domains in the sorting process. The GH-SISR/TM is a transport-competent protein that traverses the secretory pathway rapidly. The two structural components TM and SR in GH-SISR/TM endow this protein with characteristics reminiscent of a membrane-bound and O-glycosylated protein, indicating a correct integration and processing of these two domains, respectively.The transport and secretion of rat GH into the external milieu in polarized MDCK cells occurs randomly, indicating that rat GH does not harbor specific sorting signals. The conversion of rat GH into a membrane-bound protein by fusing the TM of SI to the globular domain (GH-SITM) also does not alter the sorting behavior, thus indicating that the TM of SI is not equipped with polarized sorting elements. On the other hand, the TM of SI is a critical component in the overall sorting event of SI, and its presence constitutes an absolute requirement for SI to associate with lipid rafts and to be ultimately sorted to the apical membrane (19Jacob R. Alfalah M. Grunberg J. Obendorf M. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6566-6572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Nevertheless and unlike the TM of certain integral viral protein, such as the influenza HA (12Lin S. Naim H.Y. Rodriguez A.C. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar,37Rindler M.J. Ivanov I.E. Plesken H. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Sabatini D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1304-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), neuraminidase (38Jones L.V. Compans R.W. Davis A.R. Bos T.J. Nayak D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2181-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and the envelope glycoprotein of simian virus (39Huang X.F. Compans R.W. Chen S. Lamb R.A. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27598-27604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the TM of SI alone is not sufficient to mediate apical targeting. In fact, an SI deletion mutant containing the TM domain, but lacking another structurally critical domain, the O-glycosylated stalk region, is sorted randomly in epithelial cells and does not acquire TX-100 detergent insolubility during its passage through the TGN (19Jacob R. Alfalah M. Grunberg J. Obendorf M. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6566-6572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The information harbored in the TM of the HA and neuraminidase, for example, is presumably indirectly utilized for the apical sorting event. It is most likely essential for the acquisition of these proteins to a particular quaternary structure, such as trimers or tetramers, and these structures facilitate the association of these proteins with lipid rafts that function as vehicles to the apical membrane. In fact, certain mutations in the TM domain of HA strongly affect its folding properties, including trimerization and susceptibility to trypsin, and inhibit its association with lipid rafts and subsequent apical targeting (12Lin S. Naim H.Y. Rodriguez A.C. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). A similar potential role for the TM of SI cannot therefore be hypothesized, because SI maintains a monomeric structure throughout its life cycle. Within the SI protein, the TM domain functions in concert with another critical and essential region in mediating association of SI with lipid rafts and apical sorting. Like the TM domain, the heavily O-glycosylated stalk region (SR) is a necessary but not a sufficient component of the sorting mechanism. Given the primordial importance of the TM and SR domains in the context of SI apical sorting, it is surprising at first glance that these domains in the GH-SISR/TM chimera are not capable of routing this protein to the apical membrane and mediating its interaction with lipid rafts. The possibility of altered structural features in the SR and TM within the context of rat GH is unlikely to explain the altered sorting behavior. HeavyO-glycosylation of the stalk region in the GH-SISR/TM occurs and is expected to generate a rigid unfolded structure that would behave autonomously in SI as well as in GH-SISR/TM. Likewise, the successful anchorage of GH-SISR/TM in the membrane through the foreign TM of SI is reminiscent of a fulfillment of the structural requirements of a type II protein. Defective or incorrectly processed fused domains can therefore be excluded as an argument to explain the default sorting of GH-SISR/TM. The association of SI with lipid microdomains is known to directly implicate O-glycans of the SR (19Jacob R. Alfalah M. Grunberg J. Obendorf M. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6566-6572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 20Alfalah M. Jacob R. Preuss U. Zimmer K.P. Naim H. Naim H.Y. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 593-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and occurs probably through an interaction with a specific lectin-type protein (20Alfalah M. Jacob R. Preuss U. Zimmer K.P. Naim H. Naim H.Y. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 593-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) that recognizes these O-linked sugar chains. One likely explanation for the failure of GH-SISR/TM to associate with lipid microdomains or rafts lies in an inadequate recognition of the O-glycans in GH-SISR/TM by a putative lectin-receptor due to geometrical restrictions upstream of the SR in GH-SISR/TM. Such restrictions are presumably not found in the SI molecule. This idea is strongly supported by the data presented here on the processing and sorting pathway of the GH-SIGly/SR/TM mutant. In this chimera SR is extended by eight aliphatic glycine residues fused between the SR and the globular rat GH domain to possibly eliminate a hypothesized geometrical restriction and to ultimately provide a better accessibility of theO-glycan residues to a putative lectin-like receptor.The inclusion of the glycine spacer in GH-SISR/TM remains without effects on the biosynthesis, processing,O-glycosylation, and transport kinetics of the chimera but generates dramatic effects on its interaction with lipid microdomains and subsequent polarized sorting. The glycine-containing GH-SIGly/SR/TM construct associates with lipid microdomains and is sorted to the apical membrane with high fidelity similar to that of the SI molecule (19Jacob R. Alfalah M. Grunberg J. Obendorf M. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6566-6572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 20Alfalah M. Jacob R. Preuss U. Zimmer K.P. Naim H. Naim H.Y. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 593-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The association of GH-SIGly/SR/TM and many apically sorted proteins with detergent-insoluble lipid microdomains is transient and is reduced or terminated upon delivery of the protein to the apical membrane. Also, a shift from random transport, as in the case of GH-SISR/TM(60% apical versus 40% basolateral), to a high sorting fidelity of the GH-SIGly/SR/TM chimera (85%) is not exclusively due to an association of only an additional proportion (in this case 25%) of the molecules with detergent-insoluble lipid microdomains.The data presented here could therefore unequivocally underscore the necessity of a spatial environment such as that endowed by the glycine spacer for a sufficient exposure and subsequent recognition ofO-glycans in the GH-SIGly/SR/TM. It is worthwhile to note that a possible role for the glycine spacer in the sorting and membrane association of the GH-SIGly/SR/TMchimera can be fully excluded, because inhibition ofO-glycosylation causes randomness in the sorting behavior and complete detergent solubility of GH-SIGly/SR/TM, despite the presence of the glycine spacer. Furthermore, a set of eight glycines does not impose a particular structural motif as deduced from algorithmic predictions (34Cuff J.A. Barton G.J. Proteins. 2000; 40: 502-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) and, finally, a multiglycine structural motif has never been demonstrated to be implicated in the trafficking events of a membrane glycoprotein. Obviously, structural constraints upstream of the SR domain in the SI molecule itself do not exist, which perhaps mask the O-linked glycans or reduce their access to a putative interacting protein. One major structural domain immediately upstream of the SR in SI is a 46-amino acid P-domain or trefoil structural motif that endows the SI molecule with a particular conformational flexibility near the rigid SR and may play an essential role in protein-protein or lectin-like interactions. A similar structure is not present in the immediate vicinity of the SR in the rat GH construct and in the globular domain of rat GH itself, and this is perhaps why a spacer is required to fulfill spatial requirements for binding to a putative lectin-like receptor.In conclusion, the data demonstrate that O-glycans of the SR of SI are essential components of the apical sorting event of a normally unsorted secretory protein. These residues can be considered to directly act as sorting signal and to constitute the recognition site required for the sorting event to ensue.It can be excluded that protein-folding determinants endowed by the SR are responsible for the apical sorting behavior, otherwise the GH-SISR/TM, which contains the stalk, would have been correctly sorted; however, this is not the case. Furthermore,O-linked glycans in the stalk regions of proteins are rigid autonomous structures that are not expected to influence other proteinaceous domains, and in fact, inhibition ofO-glycosylation in SI by benzyl-GalNAc does not affect its folding pattern as judged by its unchanged reactivity toward trypsin. 2N. Spodsberg, M. Alfalah, and H. Y. Naim, unpublished data.Despite the primordial importance of the O-glycans, they are not sufficient per se to warrant a correct sorting of proteins to the apical membrane. It is rather the adequate recognition of the O-glycans that constitutes a critical criterion for sorting, and this requires auxiliary elements that ultimately ensure the high fidelity of this event. Along these lines, our data are reminiscent of the existence of a recognition machinery that at least comprises a carbohydrate-binding protein and requires specific spatial requirements provided by the P-domain in SI or a glycine spacer in the context of rat GH.A direct interaction of O-glycans with glycolipid membrane components in immediate proximity can be excluded as a mechanism underlying apical sorting of O-glycosylated GH-SISR/TM or the glycine-spacer containing GH-SIGly/SR/TM construct or their association with lipid rafts, otherwise the O-glycosylated GH-SISR/TMwould have also been interacting with lipid rafts and sorted correctly. It should be noted that the common feature of proteins that utilizeO-glycans for their apical sorting is the organization and clustering of these chains into rigid stalks. Perhaps this is an important criterion for the strength and functionality ofO-glycans as a signal and may explain whyO-glycosylation does not play a role in sorting when it is not extensive or sporadically distributed over several protein domains.The nature, identity, and structure of a putative cellular lectin-like protein specific for binding residues comprising O-linked chains, such as galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine, is far from being unraveled. For another type of glycosylation,N-linked glycosylation, two lectin-like proteins have been described in TGN and post-Golgi compartments that may recognize these chains as apical sorting signals on proteins and mediate thus their incorporation into apical carrier vesicles. One of these is VIP 36, which possesses striking sequence homologies to proteins of the family of leguminous lectins (40Fiedler K. Simons K. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 271-276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the other is the thyroglobulin receptor (41Thibault V. Blanck O. Courageot J. Pachetti C. Perrin C. de Mascarel A. Miquelis R. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), a protein with strong affinity toward bindingN-acetylglucosamine in the presence of calcium and at low pH, i.e. at conditions that prevail in the TGN. Although thyroglobulin can be excluded as a possible lectin sorter forO-linked glycans, which do not containN-acetylglucosamine, VIP 36 is an interesting protein by virtue of its binding specificities. It binds galactose andN-acetylgalactosamine residues and can therefore function as a receptor for both N- and O-linked glycans. Nevertheless, VIP 36 has been detected not only in apical transport vesicles but also in basolateral carriers (42Hauri H. Appenzeller C. Kuhn F. Nufer O. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 43Fullekrug J. Scheiffele P. Simons K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2813-2821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, elimination of galactose in a particular mutant MDCK cell line or through inhibition of N-glycan processing by mannosidase I and II remains without marked alteration of the sorting pattern of manyN-linked glycosylated membrane-bound as well as secretory proteins. These observations together do not underscore a definite role of VIP 36 in the sorting machinery ofN-linked, presumably also, in that of O-linked glycoproteins. The absence of N-linked carbohydrates from our rat GH constructs, which may interfere with the folding pattern and the exclusive presence of O-linked glycans in the SR, should be helpful in directly analyzing the binding of these constructs to lectin-like cellular components. The polarity of epithelial cells is characterized by two functionally and structurally different plasma membrane domains, the apical and the basolateral. Separated by tight junctions, the two surfaces contain distinct compositions of proteins and lipids. The maintenance of polarity requires sorting as well as domain-specific retention of newly synthesized and recycling proteins (1Matter K. Mellman I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 2Rodriguez-Boulan E. Powell S.K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 395-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Protein constituents are transported along the secretory pathway to thetrans-Golgi network (TGN)1 where they are sorted to either one of these two domains (3Matlin K.S. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 2131-2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 4Simons K. Wandinger-Ness A. Cell. 1990; 62: 207-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 5Hara-Kuge S. Ohkura T. Seko A. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Basolateral targeting generally depends upon the existence of a tyrosine-based cryptic signal or a di-leucine motif in the cytoplasmic tail of the sorted protein (1Matter K. Mellman I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar,6Keller P. Simons K. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 3001-3009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The apical delivery of membrane and secretory proteins is more complex and utilizes several types of signals suggesting the existence of multiple binding sites for apical signals in the sorting machinery.

The enzyme is composed of three components. dI and dIII, which bind NAD(H) and NADP(H), respectively, protrude into the mitochondrial matrix (or the bacterial cytoplasm), and dII spans the membrane. The intact enzyme is effectively a dimer of two dI·dII·dIII “trimers” (13Persson B. Ahnstrom G. Rydstrom J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 259: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 14Hou C. Potier M. Bragg P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1018: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), though there are species variations in the way the polypeptide chains are joined.The findings that the transfer of hydride-ion equivalents between the bound nucleotides on transhydrogenase is direct (3Venning J.D.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 105: 397-409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) together establish that coupling to proton translocation does not occur at the redox step. We proposed an NADP(H) binding change model in which NADP+ (or NADPH) from the solvent can only bind to (or leave from) an “open” state of the dIII component of the protein and in which the redox reaction can only take place in an “occluded” state. Association and dissociation of protons during translocation, gated by the redox state of the NADP(H), drives the protein between the open and occluded states (16Hutton M.N. Day J.M. Bizouarn T. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 1041-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 7Jackson J.B. Peake S.J. White S.A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Recent observations on pronounced structural asymmetries in transhydrogenase suggest that the two dI·dII·dIII trimers of the complete enzyme undergo reciprocating alternations of conformation during turnover (12Cotton N.P.J. White S.A. Peake S.J. McSweeney S. Jackson J.B. Structure. 2001; 9: 165-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, as the dIII in one trimer enters the open state to permit product release and substrate binding, the other enters the occluded state to permit hydride transfer; the two trimers run 180oout of phase. In general, a mechanism of coupling involving changes in NADP(H) binding is also favored by other authors (17Hatefi Y. Yamaguchi M.

It is a dI2·dIII1 heterotrimer in both the crystalline state and in solution (12Cotton N.P.J. White S.A. Peake S.J. McSweeney S. Jackson J.B.

The two characteristic properties, (a) a capacity to catalyze a rapid redox reaction between NAD(H) and NADP(H) (or their analogues) and (b) an extremely slow rate of release of bound NADP+ and NADPH, suggest that the isolated complex adopts a conformation similar to that of the occluded state in the intact enzyme. These properties of the dI2·dIII1complex can be partly rationalized in terms of features seen in the x-ray structure of the protein. The redox reaction between NADP(H) and AcPdAD(H)1 (an NAD(H) analogue) on the dI2·dIII1 complex was studied by stopped-flow spectrophotometry (3Venning J.D. Grimley R.L. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J.

A rapid, single turnover burst of hydride transfer precedes the slow steady-state reaction that is limited by product NADP(H) release. A E155W mutant of dIII was subsequently isolated to study these processes with physiological nucleotides from changes in protein fluorescence, but the forward reaction was too fast to measure by stopped-flow (6Venning J.D. Peake S.J. Quirk P.G. Jackson J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19490-19497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In this report we describe measurements of the forward reaction with physiological nucleotides using a newly developed continuous flow device. The reaction is faster than predicted from the stopped-flow experiments, and thus the on-enzyme equilibrium constant is greater than expected.MATERIALS AND METHODSThe expression and purification of the isolated wild-type dI (and both the wild-type and the E155W mutant of dIII) from R. rubrum transhydrogenase were carried out as described (3Venning J.D.

Protein concentrations were determined using the microtannin assay (24Mejbaum-Katzenellenbogen S. Drobryszycka W.J. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1959; 4: 515-522Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In both stopped-flow and continuous flow experiments, the dI and dIII proteins were premixed in a 2:1 molar ratio to give the dI2·dIII1 complex and loaded into in the appropriate drive syringe. Given the lowKd and rate of dissociation of the complex, this ensures that the redox reaction proceeds as a monoexponential reaction (3Venning J.D. Grimley R.L. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B.

Experiments were performed in 10 mm(NH4)2SO4 and 20 mmHepes, pH 8.0, at 20 °C.Sub-millisecond kinetic measurements were performed in a homebuilt continuous flow instrument based on that described by Shastry et al. (25Shastry M.C.R. Luck S.D. Roder H. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2714-2721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Our instrument uses their capillary mixer coupled to a 0.25 × 0.25 × 20-mm quartz flow cell (Hellma Cells, Inc.). The dI2·dIII1-NADP+solution and the NADH solution were delivered to the mixer in a 1:10 volumetric ratio using a stepper-motor drive unit developed by Hi-Tech Ltd. (Salisbury, United Kingdom). A 100-watt Hg arc lamp (Osram, Germany), a monochromator, and a cylindrical lens were used to excite fluorescence at 291 nm (4-nm bandwidth), illuminating the 20-mm axis of the flow cell along a 250-μm path length. Fluorescence emission (320–400 nm) was selected with a combination of WG320 and UG11 filters (Schott) and was recorded by imaging the flow (total length of image, 16.5 mm) using a digital camera system (Micromax, Roper Scientific) equipped with a SenSys:1401E CCD chip with an array of 1317 × 1035 pixels. Images were converted into intensity profiles along the direction of flow by averaging the rows of pixels across the width of the channel. Relative fluorescence intensities were determined by comparison with images derived from experiments in which NADP+-loaded dI2·dIII1 complex was mixed with buffer in the absence of NADH. Kinetic traces were calculated as described before (25Shastry M.C.R. Luck S.D. Roder H. Biophys.

Observed rate constants were obtained by non-linear least squares analysis. The dead time of the instrument, measured by quenching tryptophan fluorescence withN-bromosuccinimide (26Peterman B.F. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 93: 442-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), was 150 μs.Stopped flow experiments were performed on an Applied PhotophysicsDX-17MV operating in its fluorescence mode with a 280-nm excitation light and >305-nm emission (selected with a WG305 cut-off filter) and with both monochromator slits set to a bandwidth of 9.3 nm. In each experiment, seven data sets were averaged and analyzed using the instrument software. For further details, see Refs. 3Venning J.D. Grimley R.L. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. J. Biol.

The preparative enzymes were removed by centrifugation through Vivaspin filters (5-kDa cut-off), and the deuterated nucleotides were purified by ion-exchange chromatography. For both nucleotides,A260/A340 < 2.25 (where ≤2.3 is analytically pure). In all measurements of the kinetic isotope effect, control experiments were performed with undeuterated reduced nucleotides prepared by similar procedures.RESULTSThe isolated dIII component of R. rubrumtranshydrogenase, as prepared in our laboratory, is associated with tightly bound nucleotide, either NADP+ or NADPH (3Venning J.D.

Biochem. 1996; 241: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The E155W mutant of the dIII protein has a single tryptophan residue. The mutation does not significantly affect either the NADP(H) binding properties or the catalytic properties of the protein (6Venning J.D. Peake S.J. Quirk P.G. Jackson J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19490-19497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 30Peake S.J. Venning J.D. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1413: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, the fluorescence emission of the introduced Trp residue is sensitive to the redox state of the bound nucleotide; it is about 25% less intense when the nucleotide is reduced. For the equivalent fluorescence change in Escherichia coli dIII, it was proposed that resonance-energy transfer is responsible for the difference, but effects due to conformational changes cannot be eliminated (22Fjellstrom O. Johansson C. Rydstrom J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11331-11341Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In the experiments shown in Fig. 1, dIII·E155W in its NADP+ form was premixed with R. rubrum dI (nucleotide-free) at protein concentrations that gave the dI2·dIII1 heterotrimer. The change in Trp-155 fluorescence was recorded after the rapid mixing of this solution with NADH in the continuous flow instrument. In each trace, the fluorescence rapidly decreased with approximately monoexponential kinetics as the bound NADP+ was reduced. Note that product NADPH is released only extremely slowly from the protein (koff < 3 × 10−4s−1 (23Venning J.D. Rodrigues D.J. Weston C.J. Cotton N.P.J. Quirk P.G. Errington N. Finet S. White S.A. Jackson J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30676-30685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (28) Google Scholar)), and therefore the redox reaction is limited to only one turnover (4Venning J.D. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Quirk P.G. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 202-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The dependence of the apparent first-order rate constant of the fluorescence change on the concentration of NADH is shown in Fig. 2. At saturation, this rate constant approached a very high value, kapp = 21,200 s−1, close to the limit of resolution of the instrument.Figure 2The dependence of the observed first-order rate constant of the single turnover reduction of NADP+ by NADH on the concentration of NADH. Data were taken from experiments similar to those described in the legend for Fig. 1. Theline shows the best fitting hyperbola.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We can now go some way toward estimating the microscopic rate constants and the equilibrium constant for the redox reaction involving the physiological substrates on transhydrogenase. Scheme FS1describes the forward reaction (above), and Scheme FS2 describes the corresponding reverse reaction; that is the oxidation of dI2·dIII1·NADPH by NAD+, as studied earlier in the stopped-flow instrument (6Venning J.D. Peake S.J. Quirk P.G. Jackson J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19490-19497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Because thekapp for the reaction in Scheme FS1(kapp(f) = 21,200 s−1) is much greater than that for Scheme FS2 (kapp(r) = 590 s−1 (6Venning J.D. Peake S.J. Quirk P.G. Jackson J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19490-19497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar)), the former goes almost to completion andkapp(f) ≈ kf (the first-order rate constant of the redox step in the forward direction). However, the reaction in Scheme FS2 is reversible, andkapp(r) has contributions from bothkf and kr : in the limitkapp(r) = kf +kr (for example, see Ref. 31Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman, New York1985: 130-131Google Scholar). Therefore,kr < 590 s−1, and the equilibrium constant of the redox reaction on the protein is Keq = kf /kr > 36. In fact earlier experiments show that the reaction of Scheme FS2 is readily reversible (6Venning J.D. Peake S.J. Quirk P.G. Jackson J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19490-19497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and thus kr is quite considerably less than 590 s−1 and Keq is quite considerably greater than 36.Figure FS1The reaction between dI2·dIII1 loaded with NADP+ and saturating NADH.

Diggle C. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, the dI2·dIII1 complex (in its NADPH form) binds one NADH with a Kd ∼20 μm and one with a Kd ∼300 μm (23Venning J.D. Rodrigues D.J. Weston C.J. Cotton N.P.J. Quirk P.G. Errington N. Finet S. White S.A. Jackson J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30676-30685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It was concluded that the dI protomer whose interdomain cleft is associated with dIII·NADPH (as indicated by the crystal structure (12Cotton N.P.J. White S.A. Peake S.J. McSweeney S. Jackson J.B. Structure. 2001; 9: 165-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar)) has a decreased affinity for NADH, whereas the dI protomer with the unoccupied cleft has an unchanged affinity for NADH. In Fig. 2, the concentration of NADH giving the half maximal value ofkapp was ∼500 μm, similar to theKd of the low affinity site of the dI2·dIII1 complex. This suggests that the nucleotide-binding reactions are fast enough to reach equilibrium and that the high Kd for NADH is the functionally relevant parameter in the steps leading to hydride transfer in the dI2·dIII1 complex. Another more convoluted explanation is that NADH binding is slow relative to the redox reaction and that the high Kd measured for NADH on dI in the dI2·dIII1 complex (23Venning J.D. Rodrigues D.J. Weston C.J. Cotton N.P.J. Quirk P.G. Errington N. Finet S. White S.A. Jackson J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30676-30685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (28) Google Scholar) results from the fact that, in those experiments, NADPH (rather than NADP+) was bound on dIII (the increased Kd might represent a device for minimizing the formation of catalytically dead-end complexes). That is, the effective Kd during catalysis is 20 μm.There is only a small primary deuterium isotope effect (KIE ≈ 2) on the rate constant for reduction of AcPdAD+ by NADPH catalyzed by dI2·dIII1 complexes at 25 °C (4Venning J.D. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Quirk P.G. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 202-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), but the temperature dependence displays non-classical behavior (as defined in Ref. 33Bell R.P. The Tunnel Effect in Chemistry. Chapman Hall, New York1980Crossref Google Scholar), and this might indicate a contribution from quantum mechanical tunneling at the hydride-transfer step. There is the usual caveat in experiments of this kind, that it is difficult to eliminate the possibility that kinetic complexities cause the unusual temperature dependences (see Ref. 33Bell R.P. The Tunnel Effect in Chemistry. Chapman Hall, New York1980Crossref Google Scholar). A number of enzymes have been shown to have KIEs substantially larger than the limit of ∼7 set by transition-state theory, and this has also been taken as evidence for hydrogen tunneling (34Grant K.L. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6597-6605Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 35Glickman M.H. Wiseman J. Klinman J.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 793-794Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In view of the extremely large rate constant of the reaction (see above), it was of interest to look for a KIE on the reduction of NADP+ by NADH on dI2·dIII1 complexes. Experiments were performed at high concentrations of NADH and NAD2H to saturate the binding reaction. Although this meant that we were working close to the limit of resolution of the continuous flow instrument, it was clear from the data that any KIE could not have been greater than 2–3-fold. In an alternative strategy, we compared rates of reduction of NAD+ by NADPH and by NADP2H; this reaction is slow enough to measure by stopped-flow instrumentation (6Venning J.D. Peake S.J. Quirk P.G. Jackson J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19490-19497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The KIE on the kapp was 2.6 (Fig.3). Because this reaction very readily reverses, there is a much larger contribution fromkf to the measured kapp than that from kr (see above). Thus, the measured KIE largely corresponds to an effect on kf . It is a significant value, confirming the view that the reaction is (at least partly) limited by hydride transfer, but it is well within the limit set by semiclassical analysis.Figure 3The kinetic isotope effect on single turnover oxidation of NADPH by NAD+ catalyzed by transhydrogenase dI2·dIII1 complexes.

In aqueous solution, the standard redox potential of NAD(H) is similar to that of NADP(H), and thus the elevated equilibrium constant on the enzyme must result from favored stabilization of the bound nucleotide products relative to the substrates.

The available crystal structures of the nucleotide binding components do not yet provide an explanation for these differences in affinity, but polarization from invariant charged residues (Arg-127 and Asp-135 in dI and Arg-90 in dIII) and hydrogen bonding by invariant Gln-132 at the hydride-transfer site and the caging-like effect of conserved aromatic residues (Tyr-235 of dI and Tyr-55 and Tyr-171 of dIII) are likely to be important.The coupling process of transhydrogenase is determined by the catalytic specificities (whether the redox reaction is allowed or not) and the ligand binding specificities (for nucleotides, Hin+, Hout+) of the protein in the open and occluded states.

The functions of these three regions are not known. We tested synthetic peptides encoding these regions of Gαs on the activities of full-length adenylyl cyclases 2 and 6. A peptide encoding the Switch II region (amino acids 222–247) stimulated both adenylyl cyclases 2- to 3-fold. Forskolin synergized the stimulation. Addition of peptides in the presence of activated Gαs partially inhibited Gαs stimulation. Corresponding Switch II region peptides from Gαq and Gαi did not stimulate adenylyl cyclase. A peptide encoding the Switch I region (amino acids 199–216) also stimulated AC2 and AC6. The stimulatory effects of the two peptides at saturating concentrations were non-additive. A peptide encoding the third contact region (amino acids 268–286) located in the α3-β5 region, inhibits basal, forskolin, and Gαs-stimulated enzymatic activities.

These functional data in conjunction with the available structural information suggest that Gαs activation of adenylyl cyclase is a complex event where the α3-β5 loop of Gαs may bring together the central cytoplasmic loop and C-terminal tail of adenylyl cyclase thus allowing the Switch I and Switch II regions to function as signal transfer regions to activate adenylyl cyclase.

Among the best studied of these is the regulation of adenylyl cyclase by Gαs. (1Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (4728) Google Scholar,2Iyengar R. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 768-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). There is considerable molecular information about the interactions between Gαs and adenylyl cyclase (3Berlot C.H. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 911-922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the Gαs complexed with the functional fragments of adenylyl cyclase has been solved (4Grishina G. Berlot C.H. J. Biol.

Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1943-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and on adenylyl cyclase (7Yan S.Z. Huang Z.H. Rao V.D. Hurley J.H. Tang W.J. J. Biol.

Nevertheless, little is known about the role of these regions in signal transfer from Gαs to adenylyl cyclase. We have previously used peptides encoding regions of Gβ to identify the functions of these regions in transfer of signal from Gβ to phospholipase C-β (9Buck E. Li J. Chen Y.-B. Weng G. Scarlatta S. Iyengar R. Science. 1999; 283: 332-336Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 10Buck E. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36014-36019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Two types of effects were observed. Some peptides encoding regions known to directly contact PLC1 were able to stimulate PLC-β2, and these are thought to encode signal transfer regions. Other peptides that are also thought to contact PLC-β were able to inhibit Gβγ stimulation of PLC-β2 but by themselves had no effect on PLC activity. These regions are termed general binding domains, which are involved in the protein-protein interactions and contribute to the overall affinity but by themselves do not transfer signal information. Since three distinct regions in Gαs interact with adenylyl cyclase we determined which of these contact sites were involved in signal transfer. For this we synthesized peptides encoding these regions and tested their ability to modulate basal Gαs and forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activities. Amino acids and reagents for peptides were from Bachem. [α-32P]ATP was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Tissue culture reagents and fetal calf serum were from Life Technologies, Inc. Protease inhibitors were from Sigma. All other reagents were the highest analytical grade that was commercially available. Peptides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystem peptide synthesizer (model 431A) and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography on 1–75% acetonitrile gradients. Purified peptides were lyophilized and stored at −20 °C, and each peptide container was filled with nitrogen for long-term storage. When required peptides were dissolved in water to a final concentration of 1–3 mm. For each assay peptides stock solutions were freshly prepared. Identity and purity of the peptides was verified by mass spectrometry. HexaHis Q213L-Gαs (kind gift of Dr. T. Patel, University of Tennessee) was expressed in JM109 (DE3) cells. The protein in cell lysates was purified on Ni-NTA columns according to a protocol kindly provided by the Patel laboratory. This protocol is essentially similar to the method described by Graziano et al. (11Graziano M.P Freissmuth M. Gliman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 192-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). AC2 and AC6 were expressed in Hi5 cells by infection with recombinant baculovirus. Membranes were prepared from infected cells and used for the assays (12Pieroni J.P Harry A. Chen J.-Q. Jacobowitz O Magnusson R.P. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21368-21373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Enzymatic activity was measured by conversion of [α-32P]ATP to [32P]cAMP. AC2 and AC6 assays have been described (13Harry A. Chen Y.-B Magnusson R. Iyengar R. Weng G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19017-19021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 14Chen Y.-B. Harry A. Li J. Smit M.J. Bai X. Magnusson R. Pieroni J.P. Weng G. Iyengar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14100-14104Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). When required, the peptides were mixed with adenylyl cyclase containing membranes and held on ice for 10 min prior to assays. Approximately 1–2 μg of AC2 Hi5 cell membranes and 3–5 μg of AC6 membrane per assay tube were used. Concentration of activated Gαs was 2 μm and that of forskolin 30 μm. All assays contained a mixture of proteinase inhibitors. Final concentration of proteinase inhibitors was leupeptin 3.2 μg/ml, aprotinin 2 μg/ml, phenanthroline 1.0 mm, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride 1.0 mm. The protease inhibitor mixture was always freshly prepared. All experiments were repeated three or more times with qualitatively similar results. Typical experiments are shown. Values are means ± S.D. of triplicate determinations. The Switch II regions of Gα subunits undergo substantial conformational changes upon exchange of GDP for GTP (15Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 16Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar), and the GDP-bound Gαs subunit is known to have at least a 10-fold lower affinity for adenylyl cyclase than the GTPγS bound form (17Dessauer C.W. Scully T.T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22272-22277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Since the Switch II region is also involved in physical contact with adenylyl cyclase it appeared likely that this region might be involved in signal transfer, we synthesized a 26-amino acid peptide encoding the Switch II region and tested its effect on the stimulation of AC2 and AC6 expressed in Hi5 cells. The Gαs-(222–247) (Switch II) peptide stimulated both enzymes 2- to 3-fold (Fig.1,A and B). Although this stimulation is extensive, it is typically about 30–50% of that observed with saturating concentrations of activated Gαs under these assay conditions. As controls we used peptides encoding the Switch II region of Gαi (amino acids 199–224) or Gαq (amino acids 204–229). The Switch II regions of Gαi or Gαq are very similar to the Switch II region of Gαs except for some of the contact residues and the last Asp in the α2 helix. Neither the Gαi or Gαq peptides stimulated either adenylyl cyclase (Fig. 1, A and B). The Switch II peptide stimulated on top of the forskolin both AC2 and AC6 activities. Stimulation was about 3-fold while the observed EC50 did not change. The Gαi or Gαq peptides also did not further stimulate the activity in the presence of forskolin (Fig. 1, C and D). We next tested the effect of Gαs-(222–247) peptide on the Gαs-stimulated activity of AC2 and AC6. In both cases the Gαs-stimulated activity was inhibited by about 30–35% (Fig. 1, E and F). For neither adenylyl cyclase did the inhibition reach to a level equal to the stimulation observed by the peptide alone. Thus although the Gαs-(222–247) peptide behaves as a “partial agonist” in a qualitative sense it does not appear to do so in a strict quantitative sense. The peptides encoding the Gαq or Gαi did not affect the Gαs-stimulated activity of either adenylyl cyclase. We next tested the effects of an 18-mer peptide (199) encoding the Switch I region from Gαs. The Switch I peptide behaved similarly to the Switch II peptide. The peptide by itself stimulated both AC2 and AC6 (Fig. 2, Aand B). As a control we used an 18-mer with the following substitutions: G206P, I207D, E209K, and K211A. Residue 207 contacts with adenylyl cyclase, while the 209 and 211 substitutions would disrupt local conformation. The substituted peptide had no effect on either AC2 or AC6 activities. The Switch I peptide stimulated both AC2 and AC6 on top of forskolin-stimulated activities (Fig. 2, Cand D). As with the Switch II peptide forskolin does not appear to shift the position of the peptide concentration-effect curves. The Switch I peptide also inhibited the Gαs-stimulated activity of both AC2 and AC6 by about 30% (Fig. 2, E and F). Thus the Switch I peptide also qualitatively behaved as a partial agonist. Since both the Switch I and Switch II peptides stimulated adenylyl cyclase we tested if the effects of the two peptides were additive. This was done both in the absence and presence of forskolin. At each concentration, the peptides were tested individually or in combination of equal amounts. For AC2, at lower concentrations, the effects of the peptides were additive, giving the appearance of a left-shifted curve. However, at saturating concentrations the effects were not additive. The total stimulation appears to plateau at levels seen with the Switch I peptide (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, for AC6 it appears that the effect of Switch II peptide predominates. Even when both peptides were present the total stimulation was very similar to that seen with the Switch II peptide alone (Fig. 3 B). In the presence of forskolin, the responses of both AC2 and AC6 appear to be similar. For both adenylyl cyclase isoforms the maximal activity plateaus close to what is observed with the Switch I peptide (Fig. 3, C and D). These results suggest that there may be complex inter-regulation between forskolin interactions and Gαs interactions with adenylyl cyclases. We also tested the effects of a peptide encoding amino acids 268–286, which contains the contact site in the α3-β5 region of Gαs that interacts with both the C-terminal tail as well as the central cytoplasmic loop of adenylyl cyclase. As a control we used a peptide where the Trp-277 and -280 were replaced with Arg or Lys, respectively. This peptide inhibited basal- and forskolin-stimulated activity by about 30% (Fig.4, A–D) while it very substantially (∼ 75%) inhibited the Gαs-stimulated activity (Fig. 4, E and F). The effect of this peptide suggests that it may interact with either the central cytoplasmic loop or the C-terminal tail and thus inhibit all activities. The greater extent inhibition of Gαsinhibition may arise because appropriate α3-β5 contact is required to appropriately orient the Switch I and/or Switch II region to stimulate enzymatic activity. Both the Switch I and Switch II peptides show a stimulatory effect on basal adenylyl cyclase activity and further stimulation in the presence of forskolin. This is not entirely surprising, when one considers the crystal structure. Both the Switch I and II regions of Gαs bind to the region within the α1′-α2′ domain of the C-terminal tail of adenylyl cyclase, and the contact residues are only a few residues apart. It should be noted though that only a single residue in Switch I contacts the α1′-α2′ region of the cytoplasmic tail of adenylyl cyclase. Hence we cannot definitively rule out the possibility that its stimulatory ability arises from its interactions with regions of the native enzyme that are not present in the crystal structure. Although one might intuitively expect that there may a single signal transfer region, this is the second protein in which we have found multiple signal transfer regions, Gβ being the other (10Buck E. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36014-36019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Thus it is possible that there are built-in redundancies within signaling components to maximize signal flow. The Gsα3β5 peptide blocks Gαs stimulation, and to a lesser extent basal- and forskolin-stimulated activities as well. Since the Gsα3β5 peptide had the interaction residues for both the central cytoplasmic loop as well as the C-terminal tail of adenylyl cyclase, we expected it may mimic the effect of forskolin. A reasonable explanation for the observed inhibitory effects is that the peptide binds only to the central cytoplasmic loop or C-terminal tail and thus prevents them from interacting with one another. We added several residues on both C-terminal and N-terminal regions of the peptide and did not see any reduction of the inhibitory effects. Adding more residues greatly reduced the solubility of the peptide and making experiments with the longer peptides not feasible. An intriguing aspect of our findings is that of the combined effects of the Switch I and Switch II peptides on adenylyl cyclase activities. As expected at low concentrations the effects of the peptides was additive for AC2. A different effect was observed for AC6 where the presence of the Switch II peptide appears to block the effect of the Switch I peptide (Fig. 3 B). Thus it appears that there may be some differences in the mode of interactions between Gαs and the different adenylyl cyclase isoforms. This is an area that requires further study in a systematic fashion. In the presence of forskolin the effects of the Switch I peptide appears to predominate for both AC2 and AC6 since the activity with saturating concentrations of both peptides appears to be closer to the activity seen with the Switch I peptide rather than the Switch II peptide (Fig. 3, C andD). These results suggest that there may be dynamic interactions between the forskolin binding sites and the interaction sites for Switch I and II resulting in preferential interactions of one or another of the signal transfer regions. Further studies focusing on the dynamics of the contacts and local conformational changes are required to critically ascertain the molecular mechanisms involved in forskolin regulation of interactions of the signal transfer regions of Gαs with adenylyl cyclases. An interesting question arises from these studies: why have multiple signal transfer regions if only one is used. One possibility is that both are used since in the crystal structure residues in both the Switch I and Switch II region make contact with adenylyl cyclase. However it should be noted that crystal structure contains only part of the central cytoplasmic loop of AC5 and the C-terminal tail of AC2 and hence is not an accurate representation of a native enzyme. Further structural studies with native proteins should clarify this issue. Another possibility is that depending on the initial interactions either the Switch I or Switch II region contacts the adenylyl cyclases and each of these is capable of inducing the local changes necessary to activate the enzyme. Thus the Gαs-adenylyl cyclase complex may contain multiple conformational species. Dynamic conformational studies will be needed to sort through these alternative scenarios. Irrespective of the molecule specific details that emerge from future studies, this study along with our previous on Gβ (9Buck E. Li J. Chen Y.-B. Weng G. Scarlatta S. Iyengar R. Science. 1999; 283: 332-336Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 10Buck E. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36014-36019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) indicate that it is possible to assign distinct functions to the different regions of G protein subunits that contact their direct effectors. How the signal transfer regions and the other regions of G proteins cooperate to achieve reversible signal flow with high specificity remains to be determined.
